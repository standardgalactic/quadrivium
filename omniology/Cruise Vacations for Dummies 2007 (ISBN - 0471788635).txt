Authors’ Acknowledgments
The authors would like to thank the many travel writers and
experts who have contributed their opinion and expertise to this
and other recent Hannafin-Sarna productions, including Christina
Colon, Tamar Schreibman, Mike Driscoll, Ben Lyons, Art Sbarsky,
Darlene Simidian, Ted Scull, Anne Kalosh, Marilyn Green, Ken
Lindley, and Alan Zamchick. Matt would like to thank his wife,
Rebecca, for bearing with him during this particularly terrible, hor-
rible, no-good, very bad work year. Heidi would like to thank her
twin sons, Kavi and Tejas, for being such good sailors at the ripe
old age of four (12 cruises and counting), and her husband Arun
for putting up with the cruise biz all these years.

Introduction
I
n a sense, cruises are for dummies. That is, you don’t have to think
much on a cruise, and therein lies the appeal. The captain does the
driving, the chef does the cooking, the bartenders do the pouring, and
the stewards make your bed.
Your job is to relax.
On a cruise, unpack once, settle into your womblike cabin and enjoy the
ride. The ship takes you to as many as five or six different ports in a
week, while you sit back with your feet up, sipping a pina colada. Unless,
of course, you’re the type that prefers a good workout in the gym, a
swim in the pool, a computer class, a wine-tasting seminar, a deep-tissue
massage, or some bowling.
Yes, you can sample all this on a cruise. And more. As ships grow ever
larger in size, they’re offering a broader range of things to do and new
experiences to sample. Take the Freedom of the Seas, the current “it”
ship that debuted in spring of 2006. As the largest cruise ship in the
world (at least for now, at 160,000 tons and carrying 3,634 passengers
double occupancy), she comes decked out with cool stuff like a water
park, a full-sized boxing ring, a surfing simulator with real waves, and a
pair of hot tubs cantilevered 20 feet out over the side of the ship.
If a floating high-rise-hotel-cum-theme-park isn’t your bag, no worries,
there are also small adventurous ships and over-the-top luxurious
cruises to choose from that offer a very different experience than the
Vegas vibe the megas are peddling. But no matter which you choose,
what separates a cruise from your typical hotel is the water. Ships float.
Hotels don’t. And no matter how high-tech and modern cruise ships get
these days, the experience is still steeped in maritime traditions that go
back forever and lend some old-time charm. Massive steel anchors, coils
and coils of line, gangways, and that haunting moaning horn are as rele-
vant today as they were eons ago. Basically what we’re saying is that
swooshing through the waves in the middle of nowhere the way our
ancestors did — albeit with big diesel engines, GPS, and gin-and-tonics
delivered right to our hot tubs — is a pretty cool thing to do.
We should know: Between us we’ve done hundreds of cruises — a few
together, most apart, which is a good thing since we’re married to differ-
ent people — to everywhere from the tried-and-true Caribbean to far-flung
mind-alternating places such as Siberia, the Galapagos, New Zealand, and
Thailand. We have our favorites for sure, but through the years we’ve
grown to appreciate just about all of ’em. Who can argue with a sunset
melting off the bow, fruity rum drink in hand? A cruise manages to both
throw you in the middle of the social fray and take you away from it all.

That all sounds fine and good, you may be saying, but what about your
fears of being stuck in a small dark cabin or getting seasick? Don’t worry
so much. Most cabins have windows and many have private balconies
too, so you can step out into the fresh sea air whenever the mood
strikes. Plus, who wants to spend a lot of time in a cabin when there’s so
much else to do around the ship. As for feeling queasy, allow us to
remind you, we’re well into the 21st century. Most ships are equipped
with stabilizers to keep them ultrasteady. Plus, most ships are so big
that chances are you’ll barely realize you’re moving at all.
At its basic core, a cruise is the antidote to worry and stress. A large
crew is aboard to take care of your cabin, your children, your appetite,
and that sore back of yours. From spas to playrooms, sushi bars, steak
houses, and movie theaters, you won’t be wanting for much. And if a
smaller ship is more your cup of tea, you’ll find fewer amenities, but
much more intimacy and really great itineraries. Pretty much, whatever
it is you want out of a vacation, you can find it on one of the hundreds of
ships out there, from rustic schooners to Vegas-style megaships and lux-
urious vessels sheathed in miles of marble and brocade.
The hardest part is dealing with all the “difficult choices” you’ll face
each day. Allow us to elaborate. Should you
 Go to the gym and work out?
 Sit on the deck and chat with other passengers (or better yet,
watch other passengers — cruise ships are prime people-watching
opportunities)?
 Find a quiet place to read?
 Have a massage?
 Take a nap or watch a movie in your cabin?
 Join the men’s sexy legs contest by the pool?
 Get a haircut?
 Sign up for a wine-tasting seminar?
 Take one of the organized shore excursions on days when the ship
stops in port or just head off on your own?
With so much to do, you can’t possibly do it all, and who needs to. If
achieving your vacation nirvana means staring off into sea and doing noth-
ing, so be it. As a wise old salt once said, “Hey, whatever floats your boat.”
And one more thing, cruising is a great value vacation: For one price,
you get your cabin, all your meals and entertainment, a slew of onboard
activities, and the chance to visit a bunch of different places and unpack
only once. Still, we have to be honest, you’ll likely spring for plenty of
extras once on board, from cocktails, soda, and bottled water to spe-
cialty restaurants, facials, craps, and lots more. Of course, the captain
isn’t forcing you to buy a new dress in the ship’s boutique or have your
Cruise Vacations For Dummies 2007

hair done; that’s up to you and your willpower. For the most part, unless
you’re a totally penny-pinching, antisocial grouch, a cruise adds up to
one heck of an attractive vacation experience.
About This Book
We want to make sure that you have a totally relaxing and memorable
cruise vacation, which is why we got together to write this book. And we
gotta to tell you, all those research cruises we needed to take to become
such experts, well, it was just terribly grueling work . . . sweat sweat . . .
groan groan.
Okay, so we can’t expect sympathy. But we do want a little respect. We’ve
done our homework so that you don’t have to do. In the pages that follow,
we try to anticipate every question you may have about the cruise experi-
ence and provide the answers. For first-time cruisers, we describe what to
expect from the cruise experience, pre-cruise to post-cruise, with the nitty-
gritty on everything from your first look at a cruise brochure or Web site to
clearing customs at the end of the trip. The goal is to make the experience
easy and familiar, even if you’ve never set foot on a ship in your life.
If you’re not a first-timer, you probably picked out this book because you
don’t want to have to think much to plan your trip. And you won’t have
to if you read on. We’ve laid out everything you need to know in a style
that is quick and easy, yet exceedingly comprehensive.
Of course, you don’t have to read the whole book. And you don’t have to
start at the beginning either. This is a reference book. Check out the table
of contents or the index and read the parts that pique your interest.
The main point of this book is to show you that a cruise is just plain fun.
It’s not brain surgery, for Pete’s sake, to figure out that a cruise is a light
and easy and, typically, quite an addictive vacation choice. From the
time you walk up the gangway humming the theme from The Love Boat
to the time you get home, dump your suitcase on the floor, and take yet
another look at all those great pictures you took, it’s all about pleasure.
In the spirit of fun, we took the liberty of having some fun writing this
book. So, c’mon aboard and enjoy the ride. If you’re really not the type
who likes to smile or laugh, then you may want to look for your receipt
and take this book back to the store.
Introduction 3
Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new ship, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book to help
make your trip planning easier!

Conventions Used in This Book
This guide is designed for easy reference. We include reviews of all the
best cruise lines; overviews of the most popular cruise ports in the
Caribbean, Alaska, the Mediterranean, and some other destinations; and
a quick-and-easy introduction to everything you’re likely to experience
when planning and taking a cruise. The attractions, along with telephone
numbers, are often in bold type to draw your attention to them, and the
ship names appear in italic. If an attraction, hotel, restaurant, or what-
have-you has a toll-free number, we list that number first, in bold type,
right after a tiny little telephone, which looks like this: %.
For sanity (ours) and brevity, whenever we talk about temperatures, the
degrees are in Fahrenheit, and when we talk about prices, we mean U.S.
dollars unless otherwise noted.
People rarely pay full price for a cruise. That’s why when we list sample
rates, we list travel agency rates — the actual prices you’ll pay — not
the full brochure rate. Who knows why many lines inflate their brochure
rates only to sell their cruises at a discount anyway, but it’s an industry
tradition and, if nothing else, makes you think you’re getting a really
good deal. Usually, you really are.
We list the range of brochure prices based on the following three basic
types of accommodations:
 Inside cabin (one without windows)
 Outside cabin (one with windows)
 Suite
Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made some assumptions about you and your
needs as a traveler. We assumed the following:
 You may be a virgin cruiser looking for some guidance while book-
ing your first cruise.
 You may be an experienced traveler who just wants some quick,
easy tips about planning a cruise.
 You may be an experienced cruiser who wants an easy-to-use guide
to the cruise lines (both big and small) and ports of call.
 You’ve cruised before in the Caribbean but want to try something
new, like Alaska, the Mediterranean, New England, or western
Mexico.
 You don’t have time to wade through volumes of detailed informa-
tion; you just want a book that cuts to the chase so that you can
easily find a ship best suited to your unique personality.

If you fit any of these criteria, Cruise Vacations For Dummies 2007 gives
you the information you want.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized in a roughly chronological fashion (although you
don’t have to read it that way), taking you from the basics of choosing a
cruise through the particulars. We detail the reasons you’re going to sea:
visiting great ports of call and having a ball on board as you sail from
one port to the other.
Part I: Getting Started
We start with the best of the best, our recommendations of top ships,
top destinations, and top things to do on board. We get into why a cruise
is a great vacation choice for most people and blow holes in some
common misconceptions about cruising — that it may be too expensive
or that you may get bored, for example. And we offer some suggestions
of how to find the cruise and cruise experience that best suits you.
Part II: Planning Your Cruise
Part II helps you start figuring out what your trip may cost. We take you
through the process of finding and booking a cruise, including when to
book it and how to find a good travel agent. We also tell you what you
need to know before you get on the ship — from buying travel insur-
ance, to getting there, to packing tips, to passport requirements and
how much cash to bring.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience
Part III covers what you can expect on board during your cruise, includ-
ing entertainment, food, spa offerings, shopping, gambling, and chil-
dren’s activities. And even though you don’t want to think about it yet,
this part also includes a synopsis of what you need to consider at the
end of your cruise, including tipping and Customs regulations.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships
Part IV discusses the major cruise lines and their vessels and offers
honest reviews to help you target the ship most likely to give you the
vacation experience you desire.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go, and Why
To find out where the ships sail from and to, check out Part V, which
offers specifics on points of embarkation and ports of call. We offer
advice on how to make the most of your time if you plan to stay a few
days in the port city before or after your cruise, and we highlight the top
attractions and best shore excursions at the major ports of call in the
Caribbean, Alaska, the Mediterranean, the Mexican Riviera, Hawaii, and
New England and eastern Canada.

T
hink of this part of the book as your quick intro course,
where you discover the different kinds of cruises you can
choose from, the different regions where they sail, and the dif-
ferences between ship types. We also give you our picks for
the best ships, lines, and experiences, and run through a list
of common cruise misconceptions, shooting ’em all down like
clay pigeons. Blam!

Chapter 1
Choosing Cruising: 
The Best of the Best
In This Chapter
 Picking the top cruise lines
 Finding the best ships to fit your interests
I
n the decade-plus that we’ve been writing about cruises, we can’t
even count the number of times people have asked us, “So, what’s the
best cruise line?” And y’know what? We hate that question. We hate it
because there’s really no single answer. It’s like asking, “What’s the best
food?” or “What’s the best beer?” It all depends on your taste buds and
the kind of experience you want to have. Spicy? Adventurous? Healthy?
Indulgent? Or how about the cruise equivalent of a burger and a Bud?
That said, some cruise lines are clearly top-shelf, no matter what aisle in
the supermarket you’re browsing. And this is the chapter where you can
find ’em.
You can find the “Best of the Best” icon signaling the contents of this
chapter throughout the book.
The Best of the Mainstream Lines
Here’s the pick of the litter among the big boys. Turn to Chapter 11 for
more info.
 Celebrity Cruises: With their elegant, modern décor, incredible
spas, great service, and over-the-top alternative restaurants,
Celebrity’s Millennium-class ships (Millennium, Infinity, Summit, and
Constellation) are some of the best mainstream megaships out
there — classy yet affordable. Celebrity’s older Century-class ships
(Century, Galaxy, and Mercury) aren’t too far behind, either.
 Princess Cruises: Princess’s huge but cozy Diamond Princess and
Sapphire Princess are the line’s most beautiful ships to date. They
combine gorgeous exterior lines with wood-heavy, old-world
lounges; an innovative dining plan; and a great covered promenade

that allows you to stand right in the bow. The smaller Coral Princess
and Island Princess are big winners, too, with similar décor and a
smaller size that lets them traverse the Panama Canal.
 Royal Caribbean International: Royal Caribbean’s Radiance-class
ships (Radiance, Brilliance, Serenade, and Jewel of the Seas) are its
most elegant vessels to date, combining a sleek, seagoing exterior;
a nautically themed interior; and acres of windows. The Voyager-
class ships (Voyager, Explorer, Adventure, Navigator, and Mariner of
the Seas) are the archetypal activities ships and may be the first
vessels to satisfy the old “city at sea” cliché. The line’s new gigantic
Freedom of the Seas is an even bigger and more activity-packed ship
than its Voyager-class cousins.
The Best Ships for Luxury
Got some bucks to spend? Wanna be treated like Charles and Camilla?
Here are your ships. Turn to Chapter 12 for all the details.
 Crystal Cruises: Crystal’s handsome ships offer the best of two
worlds: pampering service and scrumptious cuisine on ships that
are big enough to offer plenty of outdoor deck space, generous fit-
ness facilities, four restaurants, and more than half a dozen bars
and entertainment venues. Crystal’s California ethic tends to keep
the atmosphere more mingly and chatty than aboard the more
sober ships, such as those from Seabourn and Silversea.
 Cunard: Queen Mary 2 (QM2) has her very own niche in the luxe
market — and in the cruise market as a whole, for that matter.
Although she’s too enormous to offer the kind of intimate luxury
you get with ships from Silversea, Seabourn, and SeaDream, she
can give you a pretty close idea of what life aboard the great old
ocean liners was like — a pretty luxe perk all in itself.
 SeaDream Yacht Club: Even smaller and more intimate than
Seabourn, SeaDream’s 110-passenger yachts are also pitched to a
younger and more active demographic. Elegant but casual, they
carry along jet skis, mountain bikes, and kayaks for jaunts around
ports such as St. Barts and Monte Carlo.
 Silversea Cruises: This line offers the best overall highbrow small
ships, with top-quality cuisine, roomy suites, and over-the-top 
service — including complimentary and free-flowing Philipponnat
champagne.
The Best Ships for Families
The trick with family cruises is offering not just family-friendly activities
and entertainment, but offering things for adults to do, too, whenever
they can get away from the kids. These cruise lines do. See Chapter 9 for
Part I: Getting Started 
10

info on family-oriented cruising activities and Chapters 11 and 12 for
more about the ships.
 Carnival Cruise Lines: Carnival has made the move from party line
to family line, with spacious kids and teen facilities on the
Conquest-, Spirit- and Destiny-class vessels.
 Cunard: Strange but true, the classy QM2 also has great facilities
and programs for kids, starting at age 1. Aside from Disney, no
other line offers such extensive care for children so young. There’s
even an outdoor play gym, wading pool, and spray fountain.
 Disney Cruise Line: Well, duh. If Disney can’t do family right, who
can? This is the best-developed children’s program at sea. Kudos
also to Disney’s adult activities, even though their ships do without
casinos in the interest of keeping kiddo on the straight and narrow.
 Princess Cruises: The Coral Princess and Island Princess and the
Grand-class ships each have a spacious children’s playroom, a siz-
able piece of fenced-in outside deck for toddlers, and a deck with a
wading pool for older kids. Teen centers have computers, video
games, and a sound system, and the ones on the Grand-class ships
even have teen hot tubs and private sunbathing decks.
 Royal Caribbean International: For active families, you can’t beat
Royal Caribbean’s Freedom of the Seas, with its cool water park and
surfing simulator, plus a bunch of other great diversions the line’s
Voyager-class ships also offer — from rock-climbing walls to ice-skating
rinks, in-line skating tracks, miniature golf, and full-size basketball
courts. The onboard Johnny Rockets restaurant and main street–like
entertainment promenades hold kids’ interest pretty well, too.
The Best Romantic Cruises
Some cruise lines cater to the amorous more than others. Here are our
top picks:
 Cunard: Like real royalty, QM2 was born with certain duties atten-
dant to its station, and one of the biggest of those duties is to
embody the romance of transatlantic travel and bring it into the
new century. Take a stroll around that Promenade Deck, dine in
that fabulous dining room, and thrill to be out in the middle of the
Atlantic on nearly a billion dollars’ worth of Atlantic thoroughbred.
See Chapter 12.
 SeaDream Yacht Club: SeaDream’s small SeaDream I and II are
ultraluxe in a languidly romantic sort of way, with comfy Balinese
daybeds lining the teak decks, free-flowing champagne, and a table
for two anytime you want it. See Chapter 12.
 Star Clippers: With the wind in your hair and sails fluttering over-
head, the top decks of the four- and five-masted Royal Clipper and
Chapter 1: Choosing Cruising: The Best of the Best 11

Star Clipper provide a most romantic setting. Below decks, the
comfy cabins, lounge, and dining room make these ships the most
comfortable adventures on the sea. See Chapter 13.
 Windjammer Barefoot Cruises: Well, what is romance, anyway?
For some folks it’s luxury and baubles. For others it’s a trip cross-
country on their Harley, stopping to catch the view at every scenic
overlook and then finding a good bar at night. That sound like you?
Windjammer’s your cruise line. See Chapter 13.
 Windstar Cruises: Pure romance is a day with your loved one in a
private cove or another secluded spot with one of Windstar’s big
sailing ships anchored offshore. Windstar offers a truly unique
cruise experience, giving passengers the delicious illusion of adven-
ture (by stopping at small coves and such), along with relatively
sizable small vessels and high-quality cuisine and service. See
Chapter 13.
The Best Party Cruises
Looking for a party at sea? Try one of these cruise lines:
 Carnival Cruise Lines: What, you thought Carnival’s ships were
called “The Fun Ships” because they could tell a good joke? Back in
the day, this is where you went for a full-time party cruise. Things
have toned down a lot since then, but the pool deck is still loud and
crazy, and the discos and nightspots hop until the early morning
hours — especially on the short 3- and 4-night weekend cruises.
See Chapter 11.
 Norwegian Cruise Line: NCL’s newest ships are designed to give
the illusion of a night out in the big city, with ten restaurants, tons
of bars, a clipboard full of activities, and some of the best entertain-
ment at sea. An added plus: The ships all have casual dress codes
and open-seating dining, creating more mingling opportunities. As
on Carnival and Royal Caribbean, it’s the short 3- and 4-night itiner-
aries on their older ships that keep the party funkin’ right. See
Chapter 11.
 Royal Caribbean International: As with Carnival, lots of Royal
Caribbean’s customers are in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, with short
cruises drawing the hardier partiers. For an exciting Saturday-night-
out-on-the-town barhopping kind of experience, the Freedom- and
Voyager-class ships feature a multideck, boulevard-like promenade
running down their centers, lined with shops, bars, cafes, and
entertainment outlets. See Chapter 11.
 Windjammer Barefoot Cruises: Erotic tart-eating contest, anyone?
Okay, so that’s only on their singles cruises, but you get the idea.
On regular cruises, the free rum punch, cheap beers, and visits to
legendary Caribbean beach bars make sure you’ll be reeling like the
proverbial drunken sailor, if that’s your thing. See Chapter 13.
Part I: Getting Started 
12

The Best Small-Ship Cruises
If the big ships aren’t your thing, slide on over to one of these small-
ship operators, who put more of an emphasis on learning about the 
destination than on shopping, sightseeing, and Big Whoopin’ Fun. See 
Chapter 13 for the scoop on each.
 Cruise West and Clipper Cruise Line (Alaska/Russian Far East):
Want a real expedition? Cruise West’s Spirit of Oceanus and
Clipper’s Clipper Odyssey offer 2-week cruises that sail from main-
land Alaska across the Bering Sea to far-eastern Russia, also taking
in remote, little-visited islands along Alaska’s western coast. It’s like
sailing right off the map of civilization.
 Cruise West, Lindblad, and American Safari Cruises (Baja/Sea of
Cortez): For cruise ships, Mexico’s Baja Peninsula is like the bizarro
Alaska. It’s where the small ships (and the humpback whales) go for
winter, substituting Baja’s red dirt, cacti, and ruggedly beautiful
coastal islands for Alaska’s moss, rain forests, and glaciers.
 Lindblad Expeditions (Antarctica, Galapagos, and other exotic
destinations): This preeminent small-ship line for a really adventur-
ous, learning-oriented experience is all the better for its recently
formed alliance with the National Geographic Society. The Society
gets a permanent presence on the sea, and Lindblad gets a slew of
scientists, photographers, and other lecturers to wow guests.
 Maine Windjammer Association (Maine coast): Owner-operated
historic schooners sailing along one of the prettiest stretches of
coast in the whole country — how do you top that? It’s like summer
camp for adults, with a rustic vibe and real, live wind in your hair.
 Majestic America Line (Mississippi River): Mark Twain fan? Head
for Delta Queen, Mississippi Queen, and American Queen, three real
Mississippi River stern-wheelers that look so in-place on the river
that you’ll think you’ve gone through a time warp. Bonuses? Cajun
and Southern cooking, river storytelling, and a calliope to comple-
ment a music program full of Dixieland jazz and swing.
The Best Ships for Uncompromising
Gourmands
Food and cruising go hand and hand. Find the best dining on these
cruise lines:
 Celebrity Cruises: Among the mainstream lines, it doesn’t get any
better than the intimate, elegant, reservations-only alternative
restaurants on Celebrity’s Millennium-class ships, with their arti-
facts from classic Golden Age ocean liners, their doting waiters,
their tableside cooking, and their musicians playing elegant period
Chapter 1: Choosing Cruising: The Best of the Best 13

pieces. The experience takes about three hours and costs $30 a
person, but it’s well worth it. See Chapter 11.
 Crystal Cruises: Although all the food you get on Crystal’s ships is
first-class, their reservations-only Asian specialty restaurant on
Serenity is the best at sea, with cuisine overseen by Master Chef
Nobuyuki “Nobu” Matsuhisa. The accouterments help set the tone,
too — chopsticks, sake served in tiny sake cups and decanters, and
sushi served on thick blocky platters. An Asian-themed buffet
lunch, offered at least once per cruise, gives passengers an awe-
some spread, from jumbo shrimp to chicken and beef satays to stir-
fry dishes. See Chapter 12.
 Oceania Cruises: Oceania’s dining experience is near the top in the
mainstream category, with menus created by chef Jacques Pepin,
and passengers able to dine at any of four different restaurants, all
of them excellent. Service is doting and fine-tuned, even at the
casual semi-buffet option, offered on an outdoor terrace that’s ele-
gant and totally romantic at sunset. See Chapter 11.
 Regent Seven Seas Cruises: The award-winning chefs aboard all
the line’s ships produce artful culinary presentations that compare
favorably to those of New York’s or San Francisco’s top restaurants,
and the waiters are some of the industry’s best. See Chapter 12.
 Seabourn Cruise Lines: Nothing quite compares to dining on the
outdoor deck of Seabourn’s casual restaurant, called 2, which offers
a lovely tasting menu nightly. With the ships’ wakes shushing just
below, you have a rare opportunity to dine with the sea breezes and
starry night sky surrounding you. Asian, Mediterranean, and steak-
house-style menus are featured. See Chapter 12.
 Silversea Cruises: Depart at sunset from port, and savor the setting
and the Italian cuisine in the windowed, candlelit Terrazza. Menus
are created by chef Marco Betti, owner of the award-winning Antica
Posta restaurant in Florence, Italy, and Atlanta, Georgia. A second
alternative venue offers a new twist on cruise dining, offering
menus developed in consultation with master Relais & Châteaux–
Relais Gourmands sommeliers that pair food with wine — and not
the other way ‘round. Excellent wines and all spirits are included in
the cruise rates. See Chapter 12.

In This Chapter

 Anticipating the latest and greatest in cruising
 Tossing your excuses overboard
C
ruising is like comfort food — that pizza, meatloaf, baked ziti, or
double cheeseburger you order when life gets too stressful. It’s like
a shot of Prozac mixed with a ride on the Ferris wheel. It’s a mai tai in
the Jacuzzi while the tiki torches dance. It’s a chance to see the world
while remaining in your comfort zone. It’s a chance, for once in your
tweaked-out 21st-century life, to not have to plan anything at all. The
captain’s on his bridge and all’s right with the world. But is it, y’know,
your bag? Read on . . .
Cruising: What’s In It for You?
Today, people choose a cruise vacation for a variety of reasons: It’s easy
to plan; it’s like having a full-time designated driver; you get to visit dif-
ferent towns and countries without having to schlep from hotel to hotel;
somebody told them it was a good bargain; or their Uncle Bob told them
it was a blast.
No matter what your reason for sailing is, you’re buying the same basic
commodity from almost all the cruise lines: relaxation. Sure, getting
aboard the ship that first day can be a hassle (see Chapter 6), but after
you get through that ordeal your experience should be relatively stress-
free — just unpack your bags and the rest of the week is yours. No need
to make dinner plans, since the kitchen crew is busy preparing more
than you’ll ever be able to eat — and it’s included in the price. No need
to buy tickets to the theater, since it’s right down the corridor and
totally free, just like the nightclubs and discos. No need to even carry
cash, since practically all ships charge extras to your onboard account,
to be settled up later.

A resort by day . . .
Cruise lines learned long ago that they’re not just competing with each
other; they’re also competing with land-based resorts. Consequently,
they’ve pretty much figured out how to offer almost anything a land
resort does, all while traveling along at 20-plus knots. Most cruise ships
(aside from the small adventure vessels) give you big honkin’ spas
armed with hot rocks, warm muds, and a slew of bizarro treatments that
make you feel like warm, happy jello. They give you huge children’s play-
rooms and teen centers designed to keep your kids occupied while you
go all jellolike. When jello time is over, the ships offer activities that
range from silly pool games and craft classes to lectures, computer
workshops, cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, dance classes, and
even scuba instruction. Depending on the ship, sports enthusiasts may
find jogging tracks, volleyball, basketball, paddle tennis, water polo,
aqua aerobics, rock-climbing, ice- and in-line skating, and even bungee
trampolines (the latter on Royal Caribbean’s Enchantment of the Seas).
Oh, and of course there’s always shuffleboard. Old habits die hard.
Want more? How about video arcades and movie theaters showing
recent releases? Or live sports events beamed by satellite to the ship’s
sports bar? Or just lounging by the pool or on your private balcony, or
boiling like a rock lobster in the hot tub? There’s something to be said
for doing nothing.
. . . A place to keep your stuff while in port
Now remember, you won’t be on the ship all the time, so chuck that “I’d
go nuts stuck on a ship for a week” excuse right now. Most (though not
all) weeklong itineraries spend two days at sea, allowing you to do all
the activities we just talked about, and spend the other four days visit-
ing ports, where you can either wander off on your own or sign up for
one of the line’s organized shore excursions. Generally you arrive in the
morning and depart just after dinner — enough time to get a gander at
the local sights, spend some time on the beach, head off into the woods
looking for wildlife, or whatever it is people do in the hundreds of port
cities and towns the cruise lines visit worldwide.
. . . And an urban playground by night
Nighttime is one of the liveliest times on a cruise ship. You have the mul-
ticourse dinner to look forward to, for one thing. Then, depending on the
ship, you can check out the show, hit the comedy club, dance (or try to),
win at the casino (or try to), sing the hits at a karaoke session (or try
to), or just throw back a few stiff ones at one of a dozen bars. You can
get through the night as cheaply or as expensively as you like, because
even though the cruise lines have begun offering a lot of added-cost
extras, the basics of the experience — food, entertainment, and most
activities — are still free, free, free.

Keepin’ It Fresh: What Keeps ’em 
Coming Back
Cruise ship years are like dog years — they don’t last as long as people
years. As a result, most of the ships that are carrying those 10 million
annual cruisers have been launched within the past ten years, during a
frantic period of construction that finally began winding down in 2005.
With bookings up and the need decreasing to fill more new ships, 
prices — which were ridiculously low through 2003 and into 2004 —
finally started leveling off in 2005. Oops! You missed the big bargains!
But don’t worry, it’s still a good deal, and the cruise lines are busy
adding other new stuff besides ships, to make sure your interest stays
piqued.
Like what? Think new destinations, new activities on and off the ship,
new dining options, and new entertainment. Some other trends? How
about extensive refurbishments of older ships, bringing them more in line
with what the newbies offer. Royal Caribbean got the ball rolling on this
with its big 2003 refurb of the 1991 ship Monarch of the Seas, followed by
redos of Empress, Sovereign, and Enchantment of the Seas — the latter of
which was chopped in half and welded back together with a new midsec-
tion, increasing her size substantially. Celebrity Cruises put $55 million
into revitalizing its decade-old Century, adding a sushi bar and a restau-
rant designed around a Murano glass theme. Holland America upgraded
its older vessels to the standards of its new “Signature of Excellence” ini-
tiative, with comfier cabins, a new culinary arts center, new restaurants
and Internet cafes, and vastly improved kids’ and teens’ facilities. Disney
teen centers also got the supersizing treatment.
Speaking of Disney, and other brand names, cruise lines have been busily
associating themselves with established brands over the past year, hoping
to hitchhike on their name recognition. Celebrity, for example, teamed up
with Cirque du Soleil to bring its brand of fantasy circus magic to the line’s
megaships. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) followed by announcing a part-
nership with the famed Second City improv comedy group. Over at
Cunard, the cobranding was with London’s Royal Academy of Dramatic
Art, whose graduates and students perform short plays and offer read-
ings, workshops, and acting classes on QM2’s transatlantic crossings. The
ship’s Cunard ConneXions learning program also includes informal talks
by instructors and lecturers from Oxford University and elsewhere, while
programs in the ship’s planetarium have been created by NASA, the
American Museum of Natural History, and others.
Another new trend is (eek) cell phone, with many cruise lines installing
satellite systems that allow passengers to connect using regular GSM
cell phones. Costa Cruises was the first to introduce it, in late 2003 (with
service going fleetwide in 2006), and now Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal
Caribbean, Celebrity, and Oceania are all scheduled to have service
fleetwide or nearly so by the end of 2006. (Because NCL’s Hawaii-based
Chapter 2: Is a Cruise for Youse? 17

ships always sail close to the islands, passengers can use their phones
onboard without the special hookup.) Among the luxury ships, Regent
Seven Seas whole fleet, Crystal Cruises’ Crystal Serenity, and Silversea’s
Silver Shadow and Silver Whisper were all wired, with plans calling for
Silver Cloud and Silver Wind to be wired in the coming months. At press
time, industry big gun Carnival and sister-line Holland America still
hadn’t committed to cellular, but we expect nearly evvvverybody to
have phones beeping onboard fairly soon, so pack your Prozac. We reap
what we sow.
Seeing the world
You can cruise around North America, Central America, South America,
Europe, Scandinavia, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the South Pacific,
Australia, New Zealand, and even the Arctic and Antarctica — pretty much
anywhere there’s water. If you’ve got a few months (and bucks), there are
even world cruises that take you all the way around the globe. In this
book, we highlight the most popular cruising regions: the Caribbean and
Mexican Riviera for classic fun-in-the-sun vacations; Alaska for the wilder-
ness, wildlife, Native culture, and scenery; the Mediterranean for history;
eastern Canada and New England for charm and fall foliage; and Hawaii
for, well, paradise.
Travelers on a longer leash can sail to the edges of the cruise world, hit-
ting historic and politically edgy locales such as Lebanon and Syria;
exotic stops such as Vietnam, Tahiti, and Morocco; totally bizarro spots
such as eastern Siberia and the fjords of Greenland; and all-American
waterways such as the Mississippi River, the Columbia and Snake Rivers,
and the Erie Canal.
Sailing from everywhere
We’re stressed-out 21st century types, so the idea of getting on a plane
and flying all day just so we can get on a ship and then relax is less than
appealing. That’s why we’re thrilled that cruise lines have finally figured
out that they can sail from somewhere other than Florida, and have
begun fanning out to other ports all along the U.S. coast, within driving
(and in some cases walking) distance from big population centers.
At last count, there were more than 20 homeports on the U.S. mainland,
from which you could sail to Bermuda, New England, eastern Canada,
Florida, the Bahamas, the Caribbean, Alaska, Hawaii, Mexico, and Europe.
Beyond the traditional Florida ports of Miami and Ft. Lauderdale (plus
Cape Canaveral, Tampa, and, to a lesser extent, Jacksonville), other cities
that host big cruise ships on a regular basis include Anchorage (AK),
Baltimore (MD), Bayonne (NJ), Boston (MA), Charleston (SC), Galveston
(TX), Los Angeles (CA), New York (NY), Norfolk (VA), Philadelphia (PA),
San Diego (CA), and Seattle (WA), and we’re not even mentioning the
countless other cities that serve as homeports for the small, specialized
ships. The upshot is that unless you live in Nebraska, there’s a good
chance you can drive to your ship, saving yourself both time and money.

Appealing to all types of travelers
Who cruises? According to the cruise lines’ central marketing group, the
average cruise passenger is 50 years old, but 26 percent of cruisers are
under 40. Eighty-three percent of cruise passengers are married, with an
average household income of about $99,000.
Although demographics vary from cruise line to cruise line and some-
times from ship to ship, there’s a ship for pretty much any kind of
person who’s looking for one. The mainstream lines are the great gener-
alists, providing something for just about everyone — which, along with
their generally reasonable prices, explains why they’re the big choices
for multigenerational family travel.
If you’re pickier but still have a hankering for the sea, consider a luxury
line or a specialty small-ship line, the former tailored to the connoisseur
mindset, the latter mostly to public radio types who want a human-scale
learning experience. A few lines defy categorization, such as small sail-
ing-ship line Windjammer. Let’s just say they attract iconoclasts.
Appealing to all wallet sizes
So the $64,000 question is, do cruises cost $64,000? Nope.
Though prices have been climbing after the inverse bubble that reigned
from 2001 to 2003, at press time rates for weeklong Caribbean and
Mexican Riviera cruises were still starting between $600 and $800 per
person based on double occupancy (two people sharing a cabin).
Starting rates for Alaska cruises were between $750 and $850, and
Mediterranean cruises started at around $1,000. Shorter cruises typi-
cally start at about $300 for a 3-night sailing, while prices for weeklong
luxury and small-ship cruises typically start around $2,000 per person
and up (sometimes way, way up) from there.
Your fare includes your accommodations, three meals a day (or six, if
you can eat that much), a plethora of onboard activities, use of pools
and gyms, nighttime entertainment, and travel to several ports of call.
Overall, it adds up to great value and convenience — but don’t assume
everything’s included. Travel expenses to and from the ship are gener-
ally not. Nor are shore excursions (except aboard some small-ship
adventure lines), and they can easily add up to $500 or more during the
week. Bar drinks aren’t included except aboard some luxury lines, and
can run . . . well, that depends on you, as does the amount you’re willing
to risk in the casino or drop in the spa for a facial, massage, or mud
wrap. Gratuities for the crew are not included on most lines, which pay
their service staff minimal salaries on the assumption that they’ll make
most of their pay in tips. Generally, expect to tip about $70 to $100 per
person during a weeklong cruise. (For more on tipping, see Chapter 4.)
To beef up their bottom lines, cruise lines push a slew of added-cost
extras such as intimate alternative restaurants, specialty coffees, name-
brand ice cream, fresh flowers, golf-swing analysis, wireless Internet 
Chapter 2: Is a Cruise for Youse? 19

connection, wine tastings, custom-tailored suits, specialty exercise
classes (boxing, spinning, Pilates, yoga, tai chi, and the like), and per-
sonal training sessions. These extras could run your tab up into the
stratosphere if you succumb, but therein lies the trick: They’re optional.
Aside from gratuities, which you really should leave to keep your karma
balanced, you could step aboard a ship, spend not one red cent extra
during your whole trip, and still have a great time. It’s all up to you.
Answering the Cruise Naysayers
Maybe you want to go on a cruise (you’re reading this book, after all), but
your significant other is putting up resistance with one excuse or another.
We’ve heard most of them, and have found that those excuses are often
based on long-held misconceptions. Here are the most common excuses,
and our patented Matt-and-Heidi answers to beat them back with.
I’ll be bored!
When people tell you this, they probably think they’ll be on the ship
24/7. Not so. Unless you take a transatlantic crossing with no port calls,
you’re off the ship almost as much as you’re on, observing places and
cultures you may never have seen before. Typical weeklong cruises
spend four of their six full days in port, with the other two at sea, either
because it takes a while for the ship to get to its next port or just for the
heck of it. We’ve found, through long experience, that being on vacation
can be really, really tiring, so a couple days at sea are a good thing, let-
ting you loll around and rest up. Do you see us complaining about
having to sit at the bar and drink beer all day? You do not.
I’ll get fat!
Although the rumor is that most people gain about five pounds on a
weeklong cruise, you only do that if you, uh, sit around at the bar and
drink beer all day . . . or hit every eating opportunity — of which, admit-
tedly, there are many. Way many. So to paraphrase Goethe, repeat after
us: “Self-restraint is the first mark of the master.” And if you can’t forego
dessert or that plate of nachos between meals, at least make deals with
yourself: If I eat that, I’ll take the stairs instead of the elevators today. If I
drink that, I’ll go to the gym for an hour, or sign on for a challenging
shore excursion, like mountain biking, kayaking, or hiking.
I’ll get seasick!
Well, then you won’t have to worry about getting fat, will you? But hon-
estly, folks, most cruise ships nowadays are so large and well stabilized
that you can barely tell you’re on water. You probably won’t have any
problems unless you’re extremely sensitive or the ship passes through
rough water. In some places you hardly ever get rough seas — Alaska’s
Inside Passage, for example, which, like the name says, is inside, mean-
ing it’s protected by barrier islands from the ocean’s waves.

20

If you do feel queasy, try taking an over-the-counter medication such as
Dramamine or Bonine. Most ships stock medicines for less sea-hardy
passengers, and you can sometimes get them free from the purser’s
office. You can also ask your doctor to prescribe for you the Transderm
patch. Alternative remedies include ginger capsules (available at health
food stores) and acupressure wristbands, which most pharmacies carry
and which our frequently seasick friend Cindy swears by.
Cruise ships are too crowded!
Two answers to that one: First, that’s just not true of all big ships, and
second, you can’t even generalize by saying the ships with the most pas-
sengers are the most crowded. We’ve spent weeks on huge ships, such
as Royal Caribbean’s 3,114-passenger Explorer of the Seas, and have
been amazed at how uncrowded they were. Put it down to good design.
On the other hand, we’ve felt squeezed on much smaller ships that were
just not as well designed. To get a rough idea of how crowded a ship will
feel, divide its tonnage by its total passenger capacity to arrive at the so-
called passenger-space ratio.
If you’re really concerned about crowds, book aboard a small ship, most
of which carry fewer than 100 passengers. There aren’t as many diver-
sions on board, but that’s kind of the point: On these ships, people go to
get focused on the places they’re visiting, not diverted from them. Small-
ship cruises almost always cost more than megaship cruises, but you
tend to have fewer onboard costs. Sometimes excursions are even
included in the rates.
Cruise ships aren’t safe!
As we were putting together our first edition of this book last year, a 70-
foot rogue wave smacked into NCL’s Norwegian Dawn off the coast of
Florida. Seventy feet! That’s like, seven stories. That’s a big wave. It made
all the newspapers, and much was made of the fact that water was slosh-
ing around in 62 cabins, but the fact was that the only real damage was
to a few forward-facing windows, which broke under the impact and let
in all that water. There was no structural damage at all, and the only
injuries were a handful of bruises and cuts. So figure, if a ship can shrug
off a 70-foot wall of water smacking straight into it, it’s pretty safe. When
it comes to fire safety, cruise ships operate under international rules
known as Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which enforce rigorous stan-
dards for fireproofing and safety equipment.
To make sure ships are up to safety snuff and comply with emergency-
response requirements, the Coast Guard conducts rigorous quarterly
inspections of all ships operating from U.S. ports. To check out what
those requirements are, visit the consumer section of the Coast Guard’s
Web site at www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/cruiseship.htm. To make sure
passengers know what to do in case there is an emergency, ships are
required to hold an emergency safety drill within the first 24 hours of
sailing. Everyone aboard is required to participate, trying on their
orange life jackets and trotting out to their assigned lifeboat stations.
Chapter 2: Is a Cruise for Youse? 21

They let anybody on those things. There’s no security!
Way wrong. Waaaaaay wrong. We make our living writing about ships
and are no strangers to the ports in our home cities, but even we’ve
been turned away when someone forgot to put our name on the official
list. That was true before 9/11, and it’s even truer now.
Between 2001 and 2004, new regulations went into effect that mandated
a no-visitors policy; x-ray of all hand-carried bags; screening of checked
bags; the use of sniffer dogs; a security zone of at least 300 feet around
all cruise ships, plus concrete barriers; patrol boats and sometimes
Coast Guard escorts at some ports; and the screening of all ship’s stores,
mail, and cargo before they’re brought aboard. Many of these systems
were already in place at most cruise lines and ports, so passengers gen-
erally didn’t notice much difference. Other changes have been made in
the back office, including a rule that ships must submit a complete list of
passengers and crew to the Coast Guard 96 hours before arriving at a
U.S. port. Internationally, new regulations issued by the International
Maritime Organization (IMO) require all ports around the world to oper-
ate within a consistent framework to address security issues.
On board, all the major cruise lines have their own security forces, who
monitor people as they come aboard (passengers, crew, delivery people,
and contractors) and who keep an eye out during the cruise. We’re not
just talking about the kind of rent-a-cops you see at your local conven-
ience store, either. Some lines have hired former Navy SEALs as top-level
security consultants, and have hired Gurkhas, the famed Nepalese fight-
ers, to assist officers at the gangway and be on hand as needed.
Passengers will probably notice ship security mostly when boarding,
both initially and at the ports of call. Most cruise lines photograph pas-
sengers digitally at embarkation and then match pictures to faces every
time they get back aboard thereafter. Digital passcards also allow them
to tell instantly who’s aboard at any given time.
What if I get sick!?
Nearly every ship carrying more than 100 passengers has a medical facil-
ity staffed by a doctor and a nurse who are ready to handle health emer-
gencies. The biggest ships now carry two doctors and between two and
four nurses to handle the large number of passengers and some facilities
have become quite elaborate. Just like at home, a ship’s medical center
has set office hours, but doctors are on call 24 hours a day should an
emergency arise. Most shipboard ailments are fairly minor, such as sea-
sickness, a sprained ankle, or the flu (ships stock antibiotics for the
latter), but the doctors can also perform minor surgery if necessary.
Should you develop a serious medical problem, you’re taken off the ship
at the nearest port for treatment or possibly flown by helicopter to a
hospital. The latter can cost big bucks, so if you’re at risk of medical
problems while away, you should invest in travel insurance to cover
away-from-home emergencies. (For details about travel insurance, see
Chapter 4.)
Part I: Getting Started 
22

Most small ships (those discussed in Chapter 13) don’t carry onboard
medical staff when sailing coastal, river, or geographically close inter-
island cruises, because they can evacuate sick passengers quickly.
Usually, some crewmembers have nursing or first-aid experience. Small
ships always carry doctors when sailing more far-flung international 
itineraries.
And what’s with that Norwalk virus?
The stomach bug known as Norovirus (also known as Norwalk-like
virus) made a lot of headlines between 2003 and 2005 when outbreaks
caused nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea on several ships. Here’s the
scoop: Norovirus is an extremely common bug that hits about 23 million
Americans every year, mostly on land. It’s also extremely contagious.
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), people infected
with Norovirus can pass the bug on from the moment they begin feeling
sick to between three days and two weeks after they recover, and they
can pass it on hand-to-hand — meaning the cruise ship outbreaks were
probably caused by contagious passengers coming aboard and touching
a banister. No matter how clean the cruise lines keep their ships — and
they keep them pretty darn clean — they can’t catch every germ. Our
advice? Take your cruise, but wash your hands frequently.
Chapter 2: Is a Cruise for Youse? 23
Smoking at sea . . . or not
While you may picture the classic sailor as a leathery tan guy with a cigarette hang-
ing out of his mouth, today he’ll likely be sipping a diet soda and wearing sunscreen
instead. Like most places shoreside in America, all ships covered in this book prohibit
smoking in all restaurants, theaters, and many other public places such as shops and
the library. If you want to light up, most bars and lounges have smoking sections, and
you’re usually free to have a cig out on deck, in your cabin, or on your balcony.
Now, if you’re looking for a nonsmoking cabin because you’re concerned with the lin-
gering smells from a previous smoker, you’re mostly out of luck. With the exception of
Disney and Oceania (where all cabins are nonsmoking), cruise lines do not designate
cabins smoking or nonsmoking. Why? Because there’s no real way to stop someone
from booking a nonsmoking cabin and then smoking anyway. Further, it would be a big
fat headache for the cruise lines’ inventory department — how many cabins should
be set aside for smokers? Do they sit empty if not enough smokers book the cruise?
Luckily, cabins are cleaned well between cruises, if necessary by shampooing the rug
and using air purifiers. Matt, a fairly smoke-sensitive nonsmoker, can’t recall ever
walking into a cabin and smelling residual smoke.

s we say in Chapter 1, that “What’s the best cruise line?” question
is the same as asking “Where’s the best place to go on vacation?”
The answer to the latter, of course, is going to be different depending on
who you are and what you like to do. For instance, we’re fairly sure the
pope wouldn’t want the same kind of vacation as, say, Hugh Hefner. And
they probably wouldn’t like the same kind of cruise either.
We’ve been out there. We’ve seen the pope’s kind of cruise and we’ve
seen Hef’s, and everything in between, too. We’ve schlepped our suit-
cases onto just about every kind of passenger vessel there is, from
adventure ships in Alaska to megaships on the Mexican Riviera and
Malaysia, sailing ships in New England and the Mediterranean, and prac-
tically everything that floats in the Caribbean. So while you may get all
goo-goo eyed over the cruise lines’ snazzy brochures, with their snazzy
models sipping snazzy cocktails under a snazzy sun, remember that they
aren’t your best tools for making choices about a ship or destination. We
are, and in this chapter we give you the lowdown on some strategies for
finding a cruise that fits you like a glove.
Choosing Your Cruise
Almost all cruises can be divided up into three basic categories — main-
stream cruises, luxury cruises, and adventure and educational cruises —
though within each category there are various subdivisions.

Mainstream cruises
These are the cruises you see in TV commercials, with giant ships cruis-
ing around to people-pleasing ports while up to 3,000 passengers par-
take of the amazing bells and whistles the cruise lines have developed
over the past decade: rock-climbing walls, ice-skating rinks, pottery stu-
dios, planetariums, multi-million-dollar art collections, water parks, up
to ten different onboard restaurants, suites like Park Avenue apartments,
and spas that make you want to melt. And don’t forget all the rest: the
pool, the gym, the kids’ programs, and the constant activities. For all
that, these are also the most affordable ships, with cruises frequently
starting around $600 a week per person.
Among the mainstream lines, the onboard vibe ranges from party central
to country-club casual. The latter companies frequently promote them-
selves as “premium” lines — and sometimes they even deserve the term,
with a more refined atmosphere and better cuisine and service than their
more mass-market cousins. Though in many cases the premium lines
operate ships that are comparable in size and amenities to the mass-
market ships, some premium lines have stuck with smaller, more intimate
vessels of the type that were more common in the early to mid-1990s.
Other distinctions within the mainstream world? Well, consider the fol-
lowing alternatives:
 Family cruises: Some cruise lines specialize in family vacations,
planning activities for all age groups. Naturally, they attract the
biggest crowds during summers, holidays, and other school break
periods.
 Party cruises: On these voyages — often three or four nights long,
covering a long weekend — it’s all about energy, with passengers
grooving to the pool band all afternoon (often fueled by the day’s
drink specials), then staying up dancing and lounging late into the
night.
 Romantic cruises: Almost any cruise can be romantic if you’re in
the right frame of mind, but some sure do help you get in the mood.
Some lines also promote romance with onboard wedding, honey-
moon, or vow-renewal packages.
See Chapter 11 for details on all the mainstream lines.
Luxury cruises
Almost every cruise line uses the word “luxurious” in its advertising, but
only a few really are. With mostly small and intimate vessels, these true
luxury lines are the closest thing you can find to a five-star hotel, cater-
ing to discerning travelers who don’t blink at paying top dollar to be
pampered with exceptional service, refined décor, luxurious accommo-
dations, a sophisticated ambience, and fine French, Italian, and Asian
cuisine that often rivals that of respected shoreside restaurants. There
are generally fewer organized activities — folks attracted to this kind of
Chapter 3: Choosing Your Ideal Cruise 25

experience presumably want a quieter, more self-motivated cruise — but
when activities and entertainment are offered, you can bet they’re more
dignified than on the mass-market ships. No hairy-back contests here.
No way.
With the exception of Cunard’s Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2) and Queen 
Mary 2 (QM2) and Crystal’s Crystal Harmony and Crystal Serenity, these
high-end vessels tend to be on the smallish and more intimate side, car-
rying between 100 and 1,000 passengers. You’re not likely to feel lost in
the crowd, and the staff gets to know your likes and dislikes early on.
The onboard atmosphere is much like a private club, with guests trading
traveling tales and meeting for dinner and drinks — the latter often
included in the cruise price, as these lines are much more all-inclusive,
price-wise, than your usual mass-market and premium lines. But of
course, you pay for all that inclusiveness, with prices rarely dipping
lower than $2,000 per person, per week.
Though the luxury lines are more alike than they are different, we can
still think of them in a few distinct groupings:
 Old-money lines: And by “old” we mean the passengers as much as
their money.
 Active luxury lines: The focus may be on taking out a Waverunner
or sailboard more than on putting on a tux for evening cocktails.
 Family luxury lines: While kids are a rarity on most luxury lines, 
the larger Crystal ships sometimes attract as many as 100 children
on holiday cruises, and have playrooms to keep them occupied.
Cunard’s QM2 sees even more underage passengers, all the way
down to age one. The youth staff even includes two or three British
nannies who have completed a special two-year program in England.
See Chapter 12 for details on all the luxury lines.
Adventure and educational cruises
If getting in-depth knowledge about a destination tops your list of priori-
ties, a small-ship cruise may be for you. These ships rarely carry more
than 200 passengers, and rather than overwhelming you with unrelated
activities and whoop-de-do, they tailor almost everything about the trip
toward furthering your knowledge about the place you’re visiting. You
can participate in guided nature walks or history tours, go kayaking or
tidepooling, attend informal lectures onboard, or simply stand out on
deck and look — most of these ships sail coastal or river routes, so you
can usually find an abundance of nature right off the port bow.
Though their ships are small, these trips usually aren’t cheap, with the
most expensive ones hovering in the $4,000 range for a week. Midrange
small-ship operators take the nut down to about $2,500, while a few
operators of sailing ships (like Windjammer Barefoot and the Maine
Windjammer Association) offer some trips for $500.
Part I: Getting Started 
26

Within the small-ship world you can find a few variants:
 Learning cruises: Some lines go full-throttle into the educational
aspects of travel, with onboard experts from leading nature publi-
cations offering lectures and helping with interpretation of the nat-
ural world. Others focus on history.
 Active-adventure cruises: Did you know you could take cruises
that avoid civilization almost entirely, putting you out in pristine
coves where you can kayak all day, or on uninhabited islands where
you can hike the shoreline and head into the interior? It’s like the
anti-cruise, but because it’s offered on a boat, it counts.
 Sailing ships: Four lines in this book offer cruises on ships with
actual sails, though how much they actually rely on those sails for
propulsion varies from “some” to “completely.” The feel of real sail-
ing pretty much mirrors that equation, too, though the simple fact
that there are sails makes these cruises special all by itself.
Gauging Your Time Away
Though cruises are available that range from two nights to several
months, weeklong itineraries are the industry’s bread-and-butter, and
are also a nice round number around which to wrap your vacation. Most
ships sailing weeklong itineraries depart on a Saturday or Sunday after-
noon and return early the following Saturday or Sunday. However, book-
ing a 3- or 4-night getaway is a good alternative if you’re traveling by
ship for the first time or simply don’t have the cash for a longer cruise. If
you want to mix land and sea, some cruise lines offer pre- and post-
cruise packages that (for instance) pair three nights at sea and four at a
resort or hotel — Disney World, for instance.
With only one major exception (Disney), the shorter the cruise, the
more party-oriented the passengers tend to be — something to keep in
mind if you’re looking for a quiet time.
Picking a Destination
At least as important as deciding what kind of cruise experience you want
is deciding where you want to go. The most popular cruising region in the
world is the Caribbean and the Bahamas, followed by the Mediterranean,
Alaska, the Mexican Riviera (also known as western Mexico), other
European destinations, Hawaii, South America, Bermuda, and eastern
Canada/New England. See Part V for specifics on each destination.
Here’s the hot sheet on each destination:
 The Caribbean: Fun, sun, beaches, colonial history, Mayan ruins
(on itineraries that include ports in Mexico and Belize), tropical
landscapes, seafood, and drinks with little umbrellas in them.
Chapter 3: Choosing Your Ideal Cruise 27

 The Mediterranean: History, culture, occasional big party scenes
(think Ibiza, Palma, and so on), and gorgeous scenery (think Greek
Isles).
 Alaska: Massive glaciers, massive whales, massive forests, massive
sky, massive salmon, rich Native Alaskan culture, good microbrews,
and the remnants of Russian colonial history and U.S. frontier 
culture.
 The Mexican Riviera: The Caribbean for left-coasters, with as
much sun, as much fun, some great Mexican culture and history,
and a whole heck of a lot of tequila.
 Other European destinations: History and culture in the Baltics,
gorgeous fjords in Scandinavia, beautiful scenery in the British
Isles, and total European charm on river and barge cruises in
France, Germany, and Belgium.
 Hawaii: Perfect beaches, incredible scenery, towering volcanoes,
hula, Hawaiian history and culture, surfing, ukeleles, aloha shirts,
amazing coffee, and drinks served in hollowed-out coconuts.
 South America: Urban culture, Amazon mystery, the Girl from
Ipanema, suntan oil, rain forests, incredible music, rum.
 Bermuda: British men in shorts, powdery pink sand beaches, great
golf courses, friendly atmosphere, shopping for English wool and
Irish linens, and great history.
 Eastern Canada/New England: New England charm, whales, lob-
ster pots, Victorian mansions, lighthouses, historical sites, and fall
foliage.
Warming up to a Caribbean cruise
If you want a tan — and some palm trees, rain forests, interesting cul-
tures, and great shopping — consider cruising in the Caribbean. The
biggest draw is the climate, which is so temperate that cruises run year-
round, but there’s also (depending on the island) volcanic peaks, Mayan
ruins, winding mountain roads, beautiful tropical flowers, great beaches,
and a laid-back vibe. On a big ship in the Caribbean, expect to visit three
to five islands and spend one or two days at sea during a 7-night cruise.
Typical itineraries
Most Caribbean cruises are a week long, though you can also find 5-, 6-,
8-, 9-, 10-, and 11-night sailings. You can also find shorter 3- and 4-night
cruises, though these often concentrate on ports in the Bahamas (which
are technically not in the Caribbean at all, though they may as well be,
climate-wise), either visiting Nassau and/or Freeport or stopping at one
of the cruise lines’ private Bahamian islands.
Itineraries usually stick to one region of the Caribbean, either eastern
(typically calling on some combination of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, St. Martin, and the Bahamas), western (usually Grand Cayman,
Part I: Getting Started 
28

Jamaica, Key West, one of the Mexican ports — Cozumel/Playa del
Carmen, Calica, or Costa Maya — and sometimes ports in the Central
American countries of Belize and Honduras), or southern (less defined,
but often departing from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and visiting Aruba,
Curaçao, Barbados, St. Lucia, Antigua, and/or Grenada). Small-ship
cruises frequently visit the less-developed islands, mostly in the eastern
and southern Caribbean, including the beautiful British Virgin Islands
and ports such as St. Barts, Dominica, Nevis, and the tiny islands of the
Grenadines.
In addition to the usual Florida homeports (Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Port
Canaveral, and Tampa), Caribbean cruises are also sailing these days
from San Juan, Puerto Rico; Galveston and Houston, Texas; Mobile,
Alabama; Norfolk, Virginia; Charleston, South Carolina; New York, New
York; Jacksonville, Florida; and other ports. Smaller, more adventure-
oriented lines offer Caribbean itineraries that depart from the Caribbean
islands themselves (you fly to the island to catch the ship) and visit 
less-touristed ports.
We go into greater detail about Caribbean itineraries in Chapter 15.
Caribbean sailing seasons
Caribbean cruises sail year-round, with the greatest number of ships
operating between November and April.
High season runs from the third week in January to right around the
Easter/spring-break period. The sailings most likely to sell out, however,
are those during school holidays, such as Christmas and New Year’s and
during the summer season. You’re sure to see lots of families aboard
then, and lots of kids.
If you’re anxious about hurricane season, which runs from approxi-
mately June 1 to November 1 in the Caribbean, you can take solace in
the readiness of modern satellite warning systems to alert ships to any
danger. Although ships usually have plenty of time to steer clear, you
may be in for a slightly bumpier ride and a cancelled shore excursion or
two, especially if you’ve booked activities like snorkeling. In extreme
cases, your ship may have to change course, skipping one or more of the
islands on its planned route. Sometimes the ship can arrange to visit
another port on those days. Sometimes you just get another day at sea.
In some rare instances, brewing or active storms may prevent a ship
from returning to its homeport, and you may have to take a longer trip
back from another port. In cases like this, the cruise line covers any
added costs of getting you home.
Acting Alaskan: Heading north to the 49th state
Need we say it? Travelers don’t go to Alaska for fun in the sun. Even in
August it’s frequently cold enough to warrant a fleece pullover and a
raincoat. Instead, they go because it’s there, and it’s big, full of enormous
Chapter 3: Choosing Your Ideal Cruise 29

glaciers, unbelievably enormous mountains, huge humpback whales
leaping from the sea, bald eagles soaring overhead, and forests that
seem to go on forever. The culture of Alaska’s Native peoples figures in,
too, with the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian tribes influencing daily life in
Southeast Alaska (the site of most Alaska cruises) and the Athabascan,
Aleut, Alutiq, Yu’pik, Cu’pik, and Inupiaq peoples figuring in the life of
the Interior and northern coastal areas.
Days on an Alaskan cruise are typically spent either exploring one of the
ports (on your own or via shore excursions such as kayaking, mountain
biking, river rafting, helicopter or floatplane flightseeing, salmon fishing,
or dog sledding) or cruising around one of the state’s myriad natural
wonders, including Glacier Bay National Park, Tracy Arm Fjord, or prime
whale-watching areas. Unlike on a Caribbean cruise, where all you see
between ports is water, here you get in some serious sightseeing without
leaving the ship.
Because they’re harder to get to, and generally cost more than a cruise
in the Caribbean or the Mexican Riviera, Alaskan cruises tend to attract
an audience in the 55-plus age group, though increasing numbers of fam-
ilies have also been sailing north in recent years.
Typical itineraries
Most Alaska cruises concentrate on the Southeast Alaska panhandle, a
string of islands that stretches from Ketchikan in the south to Yakutat in
the north, with British Columbia to the east and the vast reaches of inte-
rior Alaska and Canada’s Yukon Territory to the north.
Cruises sailing round-trip from Seattle or from Vancouver, British
Columbia, are typically known as Inside Passage cruises, for the water-
way that connects Southeast Alaska’s thousands of islands. Highlights of
most itineraries include glaciers (famous Glacier Bay or several others),
the old prospector town of Skagway, state capital Juneau, and board-
walked Ketchikan in the south. Small-ship cruises frequently visit much
smaller towns and wilderness areas on the Inside Passage, and some
avoid civilization almost entirely.
Cruises that sail north- or southbound between Vancouver and either
Seward and Whittier (the two port towns for Anchorage) also take in the
ports and natural sights along the Inside Passage, but they also sail in
the Gulf of Alaska, whose sights include College Fjord and Hubbard
Glacier.
We detail the best things to see and do at Alaska’s ports in Chapter 16.
Alaskan sailing seasons
Cold weather limits Alaska’s tourist season to the summer (generally
mid-May through mid-Sept), although smaller ships may venture out as
early as late April. The warmest months are June, July, and August, when
Part I: Getting Started 
30

temperatures generally range from 50 to 80 degrees during the day with
a slight dip at night. Temperatures on the water can feel considerably
colder. During the shoulder-season months (May and Sept), travelers
can take advantage of lower rates.
Meandering the Mediterranean
The Mediterranean — whose ports include Barcelona, Palma, and Monte
Carlo in the west and Athens, Rome, and Istanbul in the east, plus every-
thing in between — is a destination for people who appreciate history
and culture. Your journey introduces you to buildings, monuments, 
and sometimes whole cities that date back thousands of years; small
towns where you can sit at a cafe and take in the local scene; and high
culture — from some of the world’s greatest art museums to some of its
finest gourmet restaurants, plus excellent shopping (if the value of the
dollar ever gets close to the euro again, that is). The ports are close
together, so large ships may stop at a different port every day, or even
visit two ports in a single day, one in the morning and another in the
afternoon. Frequently, you may also stay in a port late into the evening
(giving you a chance to check out the nightlife) or even stay for two
days, giving you longer to get a feel for the place. Many Mediterranean
itineraries last longer than one week, and having more than one sea-day
a week is rare.
Sailing in Europe provides a much more diverse experience than you can
find in the Caribbean or Alaska, and the ship’s passenger mix reflects the
international flavor. Your fellow travelers are likely to be an assortment
of older passengers, younger couples, families, and honeymooners,
often from several continents.
Activities center on museum hopping, touring ancient ruins and
medieval cathedrals and castles, and absorbing a cultural landscape
steeped in history. Depending on the ship, activities may also include
water sports.
Typical itineraries
Mediterranean itineraries vary greatly, but most ships leave from
Barcelona, Athens (actually Piraeus, a port near the city), Istanbul,
Rome (from the nearby port of Civitavecchia), or Venice. Some small
ships sail from smaller ports in Turkey, Greece, France, or Spain.
Cruises range from 3-day sailings around the Greek Isles to 10- or 12-day
voyages that visit ports in both the eastern and western Mediterranean.
Also available are plenty of 7-day options that focus on a single region.
Three regions make up the cruising territory of most lines: the western
Mediterranean, the Greek Isles/eastern Mediterranean, and the Riviera.
Some ships offer itineraries that take in all the areas; others concentrate
on a particular locale.
Chapter 3: Choosing Your Ideal Cruise 31

The area typically described as the western Mediterranean stretches
from Barcelona (or sometimes Lisbon, Portugal, over on the Atlantic) to
Civitavecchia/Rome, and includes port calls in Spain, France, and Italy.
The Greek Isles/eastern Mediterranean area includes the Aegean Sea
and sometimes the Adriatic, with ports including Piraeus/Athens, the
Greek Isles (Rhodes, Santoríni, Mykonos, and so on), and Kuçadasi
and/or Istanbul (both in Turkey). Some cruises also visit Venice and
Dubrovnik, Croatia.
Riviera itineraries include such French ports as Nice, Cannes, and Saint-
Tropez; the tiny country of Monte Carlo; and small Italian Riviera ports
such as Portofino. Riviera cruises may also include Rome.
On a smaller ship, you hit some of the same ports as the big ships do,
but you may also stop at smaller towns such as Portofino and
Portoferraio in Italy.
See Chapter 17 for details on all the major Mediterranean ports.
Mediterranean sailing seasons
The Mediterranean cruise season generally runs from April through
November, although some operators cruise there year-round.
Temperatures in-season can reach 80 degrees or higher, but nice breezes
along the coast help refresh you. Greece and Turkey are the hottest, and
if you don’t enjoy warmer weather, you should visit these countries from
April to June or mid-September through the end of October.
For details on sailing regions beyond the big three (the Caribbean,
Alaska, and the Med), see Chapter 18.
Doing the Romantic Cruise Thing
Imagine leaning against the rail with your new spouse, sipping cham-
pagne as a Technicolor sunset paints the horizon. That’s a winner in
almost everybody’s book, and it’s why cruises are such a hot pick for
honeymooning couples.
Besides their inherent romance, cruises are a good honeymoon choice
for a more prosaic reason: Many of them depart on Sunday, meaning
couples who marry on Saturday can leave the next day, and let their par-
ents and bridal parties worry about cleaning up.
Getting married aboard ship
Bet you think ship captains can conduct weddings any time they please,
right? Wrong. That’s a common misconception, and in truth the only
cruise ship captains today that conduct regular ceremonies are aboard
Part I: Getting Started 
32

Princess’s Diamond-, Coral-, and Grand-class ships. Those vessels even
have cute little wedding chapels, and your friends back home can watch
the ceremony via an Internet webcam (though it only snaps stills, which
change every few minutes).
More common, however, is for ships to bring a clergyman or a civil offi-
cial on board at an embarkation port to conduct your ceremony, either in
a public room decorated for the occasion or at a dedicated onboard wed-
ding chapel. Your friends can come aboard to see you get hitched, then
either see you off on your honeymoon cruise or come along for the ride.
You can also get married shipboard at a port of call, such as a Caribbean
island. Some lines also help you arrange a wedding off-ship in the islands,
on the beach, by a tropical waterfall, or in some other scenic spot.
Wedding packages generally start around $800 for shipboard ceremonies
and usually include the services of an officiant (though you can bring
your own if you prefer), a bouquet and boutonniere, champagne and
keepsake glasses, a wedding cake, and the services of a photographer
(but not the photos themselves — those cost extra, should you choose
to buy them). The basic package offered by Carnival — one of the big
leaders in shipboard weddings — accommodates eight people including
the bride and groom. Prices go up from there based on the complexity
and size of your reception (from a simple open bar and hors d’oeuvres
to a formal meal) and by port. Additional guests can be accommodated
at additional cost. You can also arrange for a ceremony off-ship in port,
at higher prices.
Keep in mind that you need to make arrangements for the ceremony, the
reception, and your wedding license well in advance. Some lines have
special wedding departments that help you with the details; others rely
on outside wedding coordinators.
Honeymooning at sea
Some lines lure honeymooners by offering freebies such as a special
cake in the dining room one night, or an invitation to a private cocktail
party. But you (or someone who likes you a lot) can also book a variety
of honeymoon/anniversary packages. NCL’s $79 Honeymoon Package,
for example, includes champagne and strawberries at embarkation, a
dinner for two with complimentary wine at the ship’s specialty restau-
rant, an invitation to a cocktail party, a keepsake photo, and canapés in
your cabin one evening. Bump up to the $229 Deluxe Package and you
also get breakfast in bed one morning and two 25-minute massages at
the spa. All the mainstream lines offer similar deals, with more expen-
sive packages adding spa treatments, more champagne, chocolate-
covered strawberries, shore excursions, and the like. If you’re inter-
ested, sign up for a package when you book your cruise, or soon after.
Chapter 3: Choosing Your Ideal Cruise 33

Renewing your vows
Some lines also offer vow-renewal packages for couples who’d like to cele-
brate their marriage all over again. Princess offers vow-renewal packages
that run from about $205 to $485, the former including the ceremony, an
orchid bouquet and boutonniere, a bottle of champagne and souvenir
champagne glasses, a framed formal portrait of the ceremony, and a
commemorative certificate signed by the captain; the latter adding a
champagne breakfast in bed, two terry-cloth robes, a visit to the spa for
half-hour massages or facials, canapés or petit fours in your stateroom
every evening, and a personalized invitation from the captain to visit the
bridge while in port.
Going Solo
Like life in general, cruising tends to be a couples’ sport, with most cabins
occupied by husband-and-wife teams age 40-something and up. If you’re a
single traveler — whether you’re sailing just for a nice getaway or to try
and meet Mr. or Ms. Right — things get a little more complicated.
In the old ocean-liner days, ships often had cabins designed for people
traveling solo, but those are very rare these days, and cruise lines now
base their revenue expectations on two paying customers sharing every
cabin. That’s why solo passengers generally get socked with something
called the single supplement, which is a fancy way of saying the cruise
line charges you more than if you were sailing with another person in
the cabin. The supplement can add 50 percent or more to the usual per-
person fare, though some lines are quietly foregoing or reducing these
charges if a ship isn’t filling up — though of course there’s no way to
predict this kind of thing.
You can avoid the supplement by sailing with a friend, of course, and
Holland America and Windjammer Barefoot Cruises can even find you a
friend through their cabin-share programs, which match you with a
(same-gender) roommate. If it turns out they can’t find you one, you can
probably get the cabin at the regular double-occupancy rate anyway.
If you’re looking for romance on your cruise, here are a few guidelines:
 Short cruises, such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean’s 3- and 4-day
Bahamas and Mexico sailings, attract a lot of singles and have a
real partying atmosphere. If the bar scene is your scene, these
cruises may work for you.
 Windjammer Barefoot Cruises offers singles cruises a couple times
a year, with the numbers of men and women carefully balanced.
Most lines don’t go that far, but most ships do host singles get-
togethers the first day of the cruise to let you know who’s in the
same boat as you (so to speak).
Part I: Getting Started 
34

 Some travel agents also arrange singles cruises, booking blocks of
cabins aboard large ships and setting up singles parties for their
guests. These companies include Cruiseman (% 800-889-7683;
www.cruiseman.com) and SinglesCruise.com (% 800-393-5000;
www.singlescruise.com).
Booking Gay/Lesbian Cruises
Snapshot from one of our most recent cruises: Woman, having imbibed
considerably, running up to two male passengers and yelling, “Are you
guys GAY? That’s so GREAT! I love you guys!” It’s that kind of thing that
can make gay- and lesbian-oriented charter cruises attractive.
A number of specialized travel agencies either charter full ships outright
or reserve blocks of cabins with cruise lines that are known to be partic-
ularly gay-friendly. Full-charters typically program many of their own
activities and bring aboard their own entertainers to augment the ship’s
entertainment staff. Hosted group trips typically have cocktail parties
for group members and specially programmed activities on board and in
port. Consider booking with any of the following agencies:
 Atlantis Events Inc., 9200 Sunset Blvd., Suite 500, West Hollywood,
CA 90069 (% 800-628-5268 or 310-859-8800; www.atlantis
events.com), offers all-gay charters with lines such as Celebrity,
Royal Caribbean, and NCL. In addition to the lines’ own entertain-
ment, Atlantis brings aboard its own featured performers. Past
guests have included Patti LuPone, Cybill Shepherd, and Chaka
Khan.
 Friends of Dorothy Travel, 1177 California St. Suite B, San Francisco,
CA 94108-2231 (% 800-640-4918 or 415-864-1600; www.fodtravel.
com), offers many full-gay charters with lines such as Celebrity, NCL,
and the ultraluxe SeaDream Yachts, as well as hosted tours on Queen
Mary 2 and other ships.
 Olivia Cruises and Resorts, 434 Brannan St., San Francisco, CA
94107 (% 800-631-6277 or 415-962-5700; www.olivia.com), offers
full-ship charters targeted specifically to the lesbian community,
mostly aboard Holland America’s ships. Guest performers in recent
years have included k. d. lang, the Indigo Girls, Wynonna Judd,
Shawn Colvin, and Melissa Etheridge.
 Pied Piper Travel, 330 W. 42nd St., Suite 1804, New York, NY 10036
(% 800-874-7312 or 212-239-2412; www.piedpipertravel.com),
offers hosted gay cruises that include various onboard parties and
activities and arranged visits with the gay community at the vari-
ous ports of call.

732-6822; www.rfamilyvacations.com), was founded by Rosie
O’Donnell’s partner Kelli O’Donnell, along with gay travel veteran
Gregg Kaminsky. Trips are targeted to the gay and lesbian family
market.
 RSVP Vacations, 2535 25th Ave. S., Minneapolis, MN 55406 (% 800-

800 number or checking the website above.
Rolling Around on Deck: Cruises 
for Wheelchair Users
It used to be that travelers with mobility problems had a terrible time at
sea, but over the past decade most ships have been built with accessi-
bility in mind. Ships now commonly feature two dozen or more wheel-
chair-accessible cabins at a variety of price points, and practically all
decks and public rooms are accessible via elevators and ramps.
Some lines do more than others. Holland America, for example, has a
system in place to comfortably transfer wheelchair passengers to ten-
ders (small boats) so that they can go ashore with everyone else in
places where the ship can’t dock. The system uses lifts and guests don’t
have to leave their wheelchairs during the process. Some Princess ships
have handicapped-accessible pools, which also use lifts.
Once you’ve narrowed your focus to a few cruise lines or ships, contact
the lines’ special services desks and get the full scoop on their accessi-
bility. Be aware that some lines require that travelers with a disability be
accompanied by a fully mobile companion. Passengers with chronic ill-
nesses may have to present a doctor’s note stating clearance for travel.
When you talk with a prospective line, consider these issues:
 What wheelchair-accessible cabins are available? How are they
equipped? Are they near the elevators?
 Are there a good number of elevator banks spaced around the
ship?
 Are all public rooms wheelchair accessible? Will you have to
maneuver over lips in doorways?
 At the ports of call, does the ship pull into dock or use tenders to
go ashore? Can the tenders handle wheelchairs?
Part I: Getting Started 
36

 Does the line have any special procedures for boarding and disem-
barking travelers with disabilities?
 Are shore excursions on your itinerary able to accommodate
wheelchair passengers?
If you’re on a ship that still does traditional fixed-seating dining, make
sure the cruise line knows that you use a wheelchair. That way they can
put you at a table that doesn’t require too much maneuvering to get to.
A handful of travel agencies specialize in booking cruises for disabled
travelers. Accessible Journeys, 35 W. Sellers Ave., Ridley Park, PA 19078
(% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339; www.disabilitytravel.com), pub-
lishes a newsletter and can provide licensed healthcare professionals to
accompany travelers who require aid.

O
kay, it’s not brain surgery. But the truth is, cruise rates aren’t
always easy to get a handle on. Fares are constantly in flux based
on the whims of supply and demand. At press time, people were travel-
ing like mad and demand was high. So the price of a cruise today is likely
not to be the same as it was a month ago or what it will be six months
down the road.
So what does this mean? Book early. There are always exceptions —
slow periods like September and October and non-holiday weeks in
November and December — but today your best strategy is booking on
the early side, say about three to six months out; even longer for exotic
itineraries. The caveat: if you’re ultra flexible and can travel at a
moment’s notice and will take any cabin, you may find a really good last
minute deal. Just don’t count on it.
As for the actual booking process, cruise lines still tend to do what
they’ve been doing for years, relying on traditional travel agents (and
agents, Web sites) to sell their product. Because the lines keep building
new ships and adding more ports, working with a plugged-in travel agent
to keep everything straight is a smart move. For this and other booking
and financial issues, this chapter has you covered.

Poking Holes in the Cruise Price Mirage
Just like the airbrushed Barbie and Ken dolls dancing and lounging all
over the cruise lines’ brochures, the prices printed in those brochures
for some strange reason just aren’t real, so feel free to ignore them.
You’ll always pay less, except aboard Royal Caribbean and Celebrity
(two lines who finally realized it made no sense to publish the inflated
rates), and some of the specialized small-ship lines who publish more
realistic fares. Cruise line Web sites, also print relatively realistic rates,
comparable (more or less) to what you get from a travel agency.
We’ve partnered with a real live travel agency — Nashville–based Just
Cruisin’ Plus (% 800-888-0922; www.justcruisinplus.com) — to
show you the actual prices people are paying for cruises aboard all the
ships in this book. Check this out: The brochure rate for a 10-night
Caribbean cruise aboard Holland America’s beautiful Noordam is $2,399
for a low-end outside cabin. In reality, however, during our sampling
period (January 2007 cruises, priced in mid-Apr), we got that same cabin
for $1,549. Can you say huge difference?
In the ship-review chapters (Chapters 11–13), we show how the brochure
prices for every ship stack up against what consumers actually pay for
the lowest-priced inside cabins (ones without windows), the lowest-
priced outside cabins (with windows), and the cheapest suites aboard
each ship. Remember that cruise ships generally have many different cat-
egories of cabins within the basic divisions of inside, outside, and suite,
all priced differently. The rates we list represent the lowest-priced (which
usually equates to smallest) in each division. If you’re interested in book-
ing a roomier, fancier cabin or suite, the price will be higher, with rates
for high-end inside cabins being close to those for low-end outsides, and
rates for high-end outsides being close to those for low-end suites.
Remember that rates are always subject to the basic principles of supply
and demand. The sample rates in this book are meant as a guide only —
the price you pay may be higher or lower, depending on when you book,
when you choose to travel, whether any special discounts are being
offered by the lines, and a slew of other factors. All rates are cruise-only,
per person, based on double occupancy, and, unless otherwise noted,
include port charges (the per-passenger fee each island charges the
cruise line for entry). Government fees and taxes are additional.
Counting Extra Costs
Here’s some good news. Like few other luxuries, the price of a cruise has
not kept up with the pace of inflation. And who’s complaining? Cruises
today cost less — when adjusted for inflation — than they did in the

1970s. So just how do all those big fat cruise lines stay in business then,
poor things? Don’t feel sorry for them. They do just fine by building new
ships, rounding up more passengers, and piling on the extras offered for
sale on board.
Just say “no” . . . then again, 
you only live once. Splurge!
Your cruise fare includes accommodations, meals, and entertainment,
but keep in mind what’s not included when you budget. First, there’s the
cost of getting to the ship (whether by plane or car), and the cost of
extras, from piña coladas and soft drinks to Swedish massages, tuxedo
rentals, and spinning classes. Plan on being very enticed by shopping,
both aboard ship and in port, and figure out whether you want to book
the ship’s organized shore excursions, which can really add up. Decide if
you need a hotel room before or after the cruise, and if you want to add
a few days on to your trip to, say, tour Rome or chill out in Miami.
Tallying the tips
Although technically the amount you tip the crew is up to you (unless
you sail on one of those rare “no tipping” ships), the cruise lines are
happy to offer guidelines. In fact, most just add gratuities right on to
your bill to the tune of about $70 per week (or $10 per day) per person
to cover tips for your waiter, bus person, and room steward — crew
members who rely on tips for their livelihoods. Some lines suggest chil-
dren pay only half of this amount. If you’re not happy with the service,
or were so impressed you want to tip extra, you can go down to the
reception desk at any point and change the amount of the gratuities to
be charged to your account.
Don’t worry about tipping bartenders unless they’re really good 
listeners — on most ships, your bar tab includes a 15 percent gratuity.
For spa treatments, a 15 percent tip is typically charged directly to your
bill. If not, you can write one in (or not, if your shiatsu wasn’t up to par).
Budgeting for shore excursions
Shore excursions are sightseeing tours that help you make the most of
your time at the ports your ship visits; however, they can add a hefty
sum to your vacation costs, ranging from about $30 for a short bus or
walking tour to $400 or more per person for flightseeing by plane or heli-
copter. You may not stay in port long enough to take more than one tour,
but the costs can still add up pretty fast.
Some tours are worth the money, particularly for active tours which may
not be easy to plan on your own, such as those involving kayaking or
mountain biking, or for tours that take you far beyond the port city. If
you’re a worry wart who will stress out about making it back to the ship
in time, stick to the ship’s organized excursions.
Chapter 4: Booking and Paying Up 43

Be aware that sometimes a shore tour means seeing the sights from a
packed tour bus with some ho-hum spiel and a stop for souvenirs.
Sometimes. Not always. If you’re suspicious, ask for more details of the
itinerary from your ship’s shore excursions desk.
A little planning early on can save you big bucks and help you avoid
regrets about missing out on something cool later. Before you set sail,
read up on your cruise’s ports of call and figure out what you may want
to see at those places (the chapters in Part V of this book can help).
Adding up admission costs and then comparing the cost of doing it your
way with the cost of doing it their way can help you determine whether
to go the excursion route or not. For example, Heidi has saved money
and avoided the sweaty group tour thing by taking taxis to sites such as
Pompeii, where you can rent headset audio tours and explore solo.
You can book shore excursions on board or, in most cases, in advance
on the cruise line Web sites, with your tickets waiting in your cabin
when you arrive. If you change your mind, sometimes the cruise lines
allow you to cancel or switch tours. Read the fine print carefully. If you
book on the ship, you can ask the shore excursion staff questions first or
attend one of the so-called port lectures, which typically come off more
like sales pitches for the ship’s tours and the stores in port that the
cruise lines partner with. Tours are huge moneymakers for cruise lines,
and the role of the onboard tour folks is to get you to buy.
Paying taxes and port charges
When comparing cruise prices, note whether taxes, port charges, and
other government fees are included in the total fare. They usually are,
but if not, you may pay up to $200 or more extra per person on a typical
one-week cruise. You can find information on whether such charges are
included or not in most cruise brochures and Web sites. If you don’t find
the info there, ask your travel agent or call the cruise line.
Ka-ching ka-ching, adding up onboard costs
Cruise lines make a huge chunk of their revenue on board. Don’t be sur-
prised when you first board, particularly on a big mass-market ship, if
everyone seems to be selling something, from the bar staff with the
enticing umbrella drinks to the roving photographer to the salespeople
promoting everything from cellulite treatments to scratch-off lottery
cards, fresh flowers, bottles of wines, and art auctions.
Unless you have superhuman willpower, you’ll probably buy at least one
cute professional photo of you and the kids by the pool, or a sweatshirt
with the ship’s logo, or the cocktail someone so kindly offers you the
minute you step aboard, or that relaxing massage, video arcade games,
and so on. Just like a hotel or a theme park, a cruise offers tons of poten-
tial extras. Make sure and budget for them.

Be aware that the ship’s fancy alternative restaurant may charge a 
service fee of as much as $30 a head, and in most cases you’ll pay extra
for treats such as an espresso, cappuccino, or gourmet ice cream. Turn
to Chapter 7 to find out more about the finer points of at-sea dining.

After you calculate your cruise fare (figuring in discounts, port charges,
and additional taxes and fees) and cost of transportation, plan on setting
aside $50 to $100 per person per day, not including tips, to cover other
expenses. If you want to take that $400 helicopter tour, buy a bauble in
the ship’s jewelry store, or indulge in fine champagne and cognac, you
need to budget more.
If you plan to gamble, have bucks on hand for the ship’s casino. And
don’t forget to set aside money to spend at the ports.

Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
46
Keeping tabs on your spending
You should keep track of your shipboard expenditures so that you aren’t surprised
when you get the final tab at the end of your voyage. You can do this by keeping your
receipts — you get one every time you sign with your onboard credit card. On some
lines, you can also take advantage of the interactive television features in your cabin,
which allow you to review your account regularly at the push of a button or two. And
you always have the option of stopping by the purser’s desk to check the ship’s listing
of your expenditures (you may have to wait in line to do this, particularly late in the
cruise).
Paying up when the party’s over
The cruise-bill fairy visits your cabin late on the last full day of the
cruise with your final bill, slipping it under your door or leaving it on
your bed. If you find any error or if you want to pay by cash, traveler’s
check, or personal check, you need to go stand in line at the purser’s or
guest relations desk with your cruisemates. If it all adds up right and you
simply want it billed to your credit card, you don’t have to lift your
weary head from the pillow.
Saving Bucks on Your Booking
Naturally, the biggest cost of your cruise is the cruise itself, so this sec-
tion explores the best strategies for saving.
Booking early makes cents
You don’t have to book your cruise a year in advance, but we advise
booking at least a few months in advance because cruise lines today are
generally offering their best prices to those who book ahead. Company
policies vary, and cruise lines don’t necessarily state in their brochures
or on their Web sites how far out you need to book to get the early-bird
rate, or even what that early-bird rate is. But given that cruise prices are
based on supply and demand — and demand is up these days, to levels
not seen since before 9/11 — cruise lines don’t have to do as much last-
minute wheeling and dealing as in years past. In fact, at press time,
cruise fares overall were somewhat higher than in the past few years.
Not only can you often save money by booking in advance, but you can
also have your best shot at getting your first choice of cabin. The best
and cheapest cabins are the first to sell out.
So how early is early? Lines usually announce their itineraries 10 to 14
months before a sailing. Though last-minute discounts still exist, if you
don’t want to take a chance, these days it usually pays to book longer

Chapter 4: Booking and Paying Up 47
cruises and cruises to places such as Europe and Asia farther out, about
six to nine months in advance. It’s a good idea to book shorter cruises
and cruises to the Caribbean about three to six months in advance.
If a better deal comes along after you book at the early-bird rate, there’s
a chance the cruise line may make good and give you the lower rate if
you happen to notice the rate change. Of course, you or your travel
agent must ask for the lower rate; the cruise lines generally don’t notify
you and they’re not obligated to do so.
Keep in mind that most last-minute deals are completely nonrefundable;
if you book a week before the cruise, for example, the full fare is due
upfront and you get zip back if you change your mind a few days later.
Take a chance and reel in the deals
If a ship approaches the sailing date with empty berths — which still
happens considering the number of new ships that cruise lines are build-
ing these days — the cruise line naturally gets a little antsy and starts
rolling out the last-minute discounts. If you’re able to just pick up and go
with short notice, look for the deals in newspapers and online anywhere
from four to eight weeks before the cruise is due to depart. Sometimes
last-minute fares can be pretty darn enticing — try $399 or $499 per
week — especially during slow travel periods, such as late fall.
On the other hand, you may not have a variety of cabins to choose from,
and although the cruise fare may be great, you may have a hard time get-
ting a good deal on last-minute airfare. If you can drive to the ship, the
last-minute route can be quite appealing.
Choosing off-season cruising
Another surefire way to cut the cost of your cruise is to book slightly off
season — in what’s known as the shoulder season (the front and back
ends of a high season) or in a low season. Table 4-2 lists the shoulder
seasons for key cruise locales.

Part II: Planning Your Cruise

Cruise lines often offer the best bargains for fall cruises because the
September to mid-December time period (with the exception of
Thanksgiving week) is traditionally the cruise lines’ slowest. Keep in
mind, hurricane season in the Caribbean is June through November.
Going on an introductory or repositioning cruise
When a cruise line moves one of its ships from one region to another
each season, say from New England to the Caribbean or from the
Caribbean to Alaska, it typically offers repositioning cruises at a dis-
counted price. Some experienced cruisers love these cruises, not only
because they’re cheap, but also because they tend to include more days
at sea than typical itineraries. That said, many people hate the idea of
spending more days at sea than in port.
Likewise, the lines tend to offer cut rates when they introduce a new
ship or move into a new cruising region. So it pays to keep track of
what’s happening in the industry when you look for a deal. Check cruise
line brochures and Web sites, and sites such as www.Frommers.com,
where you can get a free cruise newsletter packed with news, features,
and deals e-mailed to you twice a month.
Packing more people into your cabin
Into togetherness? Enjoy rubbing elbows (and just about everything
else) with friends and loved ones? You can pay less by booking extra
people in your cabin.
Here’s how the cruise lines pull it off: They book the first two passengers
at the regular fare and give the third and fourth passengers a pretty big
discount. And if your extra passengers happen to be your kids, the line
may offer rates just for them. For example, kids under age 2 go free on
Norwegian Cruise Line.
Going with a group
One of the best ways to get a cruise deal is to book as a group, so you
may want to gather family for a reunion or convince your friends or col-
leagues that they need a vacation, too.
A group is generally a minimum of 16 people in eight cabins. If a ship is
selling well, group deals may not be available, but if it isn’t, lines have a
lot more incentive to wheel and deal, and in addition to the discounted
rate savings typically at least the cruise portion (but not the air) of the
16th ticket is free (on some upscale ships, you can negotiate one free
ticket for groups of eight or more). You and the gang can split the sav-
ings from the free ticket or maybe hold a drawing to see who sails for
free. If your group is large enough, you may also get some freebies from
the cruise line, such as a cocktail party, cabin upgrade, or onboard
credit vouchers to use in gift shops, spas, and more.

Groups may be family reunions and the like, but travel agents also may
create their own “groups” whose members don’t even know they’re part
of one. Quick explanation: The travel agent reserves a block of cabins on a
given ship and the cruise line in turn gives them a discounted group rate
that agents can pass on to their clients. The cruise line benefits because
they’re potentially selling a lot of cabins through agency X, and the agent
benefits because they can offer their clients a good price. So, always ask
your travel agent if you can piggyback onto some group space.
Shacking up with another single
Cruise lines want to get the most out of every available cabin, so they
base rates on double-occupancy and often require singles who want to
room alone to pay what they call a supplement. This is no bargain.
Supplements can range from 120 percent of the per-person double-
occupancy rate to an outrageous 200 percent.
As an alternative, if you’re willing to share quarters, a few lines, includ-
ing Holland America and Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, guarantee to
match you up with a same-gender roommate. You score big-time if the
line fails to find you a roommate, because that means you get to enjoy
having the whole cabin to yourself at the cheaper shared rate. If you’re a
real cheapskate (and glutton for punishment), save by signing up for a
shared quad (a room for four), available on some ships.
Using your seniority
Don’t keep your age a secret. A few lines shave a percentage off the top
for passengers 55 and older, and you get that rate even if you share your
cabin with a younger passenger. You don’t have to be a member of a
senior citizens group (such as the AARP), but it doesn’t hurt. Sometimes
memberships get you extra savings.
Paying in advance
Cruise lines love to get your cash as early as possible. So some of the
pricier lines offer discounts to folks who pay their whole cruise fare
ahead of time. Silversea Cruises, for example, offers a 5 percent discount
if you pay for your cruise in advance.
Looking for free extras
Some cruise promotions may include extra treats such as pre-cruise
hotel packages and/or cabin upgrades. Some lines may even give you an
onboard credit to buy stuff on the ship, such as drinks and massages. In
some cases, you may even see an offer of free airfare (normally with
European sailings).
Reaping repeater perks
If you enjoy your first cruise, try it again: Cruise lines appreciate repeat
business, so if you sail on a line you’ve traveled with before (even if you
Chapter 4: Booking and Paying Up 49

Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
50
were just a kid with your parents), let the line or your agent know that
you’ve come back for another round. The line may provide special dis-
counts or at least extra onboard amenities. If they leave truffles by your
bedside on your second cruise, imagine what kind of perks you could
get for your tenth cruise anniversary! Some of the high-end lines actually
give away a free cruise if you’ve racked up enough days at sea.
Booking your next cruise while sailing your last one
When they still have your undivided attention, and you’re deep in that
vacation high, cruise lines often offer incentive deals to bring you back
another time. Be sure to ask if you can combine the discount the line
offers on board with other deals it may offer later. Your travel agent can
still handle your reconfirmation and tickets as long as you tell the line
who your travel agent is when you sign up for your next cruise.
Booking back-to-back cruises
People who get hooked on cruises like most of us get hooked on potato
chips are in luck. By booking back-to-back cruises (where the same ship
covers two different routes, one right after the other), you can get up to
50 percent off the second cruise. You may even be able to combine short
cruises (such as Carnival’s 3-day cruise to the Bahamas with its 4-day
cruise to Cozumel and Key West). You lengthen your vacation and
increase the number of ports you see along the way, all while saving
money — in fact, if you go for two weeks, you may get a third week free.
Ka-ching, ka-ching!
Spotting the deals
All the deals we mention in this section are terrific, you say, but how can
you discover which lines offer special rates? Certainly it pays to keep an
eye on the travel section of your Sunday newspaper and surf Web sites
such as www.Frommers.com, but remember that some of these dis-
counts are easier to spot than to assess (for example, a deal may only be
for certain dates or certain cabins, and you may not be able to combine
it with other discounts). Given the number of variables that can affect
how much you save, you probably still want to consult a cruise-savvy
travel agent (in person, on the Web, or by phone) before you make your
booking. And it pays to comparison shop, too.
Finding the Best Deals via Travel Agents 
and the Web
To find the best deals and figure out which ship and itinerary is best for
you, consult with an experienced travel agent to seal the deal. Among
your choices are Web-based cruise sellers and more traditional travel
agencies. The former rely on their sites for actual bookings, while the
latter use their Web sites as glorified advertising space to promote their
offerings, doing all actual business in person or over the phone.

Chapter 4: Booking and Paying Up 51
With a few exceptions, cruise lines have direct online-booking engines
but we don’t recommend using them. Why? Because agents and Web-
based sellers may have negotiated group rates with the lines, be part of
a consortium with whom a line is doing an upgrade promotion, or have
other deals going that enable them to offer you lower rates. In fact,
cruise lines encourage you to use a travel agency, too, and the lines
report that about 90 percent of their bookings come in that way.
Pricing the differences
As far as cruise prices go, there’s no absolutely quantifiable difference
between the real live travel agents (whether your hometown brick-and-
mortar mom-and-pop agency or a big anonymous mega-agency) and
Internet-based cruise sellers.
In 2004 and 2005, the major lines started doing something they had
talked about for years, offering all agencies, large or small, the same
rates — a major coup for small agencies that have been struggling to
keep up with the Expedias of the world. Further, some lines have said
they would have no dealings with any agency that publicly (via print or
Web advertising) doled out rebates to clients — that is, gave their cus-
tomers additional discounts by sacrificing some of their own commis-
sions. Still, don’t think there aren’t any loopholes. For example, agencies
have offered complimentary bottles of wine, gift cards, free insurance, or
other incentives to customers in lieu of reduced rates.
Doing your homework on the Web
Most Web sites give you only a menu of ships and itineraries to select
from, plus a basic search capability that takes into account only destina-
tion, price, length of trip, and date, without consideration of the type of
cruise experience each line offers. There’s no one to answer your ques-
tions. That’s fine if you know exactly what you want, and are comfort-
able on the computer. If, on the other hand, you have limited experience
with cruising and with booking on the Web, it may be better to see a tra-
ditional agent, who can help you wade through the choices and answer
your questions.
Before you actually book your cruise, use the Web for research to help
figure out what you want. Cruise the lines’ Web sites as well as those of
travel agencies and online magazines such as www.Frommers.com and
www.CruiseCritic.com. They’re all great ways to educate yourself.
Letting travel agents lead the way
Most of us would agree that a live person, whether on the phone or in
person, can offer better costumer service than a computer screen. This
is especially so given that pricing doesn’t vary that much across all
types of cruise agencies.

Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
52
Buyer beware!
Keep in mind that if you hear of a deal that sounds too good to be true, as the saying
goes, it probably is. If you get a solicitation by phone, fax, mail, or e-mail that doesn’t
sound right or if your agent gives you the heebie jeebies, contact your state consumer
protection agency or local office of the Better Business Bureau (www.bbb.org). You
can also call the cruise line directly and ask them about the agency. And be wary of
working with any company, be it on the phone or the Internet, that refuses to give you
its street address. Here are some more tip-offs:
 Beware of snap recommendations. When agents suggest a cruise line without
asking you a single question first about your tastes, beware. They’re probably just
interested in making a commission from a line that pays them the highest rates.
 Always use a credit card to pay for your cruise. It gives you more protection in the
event the agency or cruise line fails. When your credit card statement arrives,
make sure the payment was made to the cruise line, not the travel agency. If you
find that payment was actually made to the agency, it’s a big red flag that some-
thing’s wrong. If you insist on paying by check, you’ll be making it out to the
agency, so it may be wise to ask if the agency has default protection. Many do.
 Always follow the cruise line’s payment schedule. Never agree to a different
schedule the travel agency comes up with. The lines’ terms are always clearly
printed in their brochures and usually require an initial deposit, with the balance
due no later than 75 to 45 days before departure. If you’re booking two months or
less before departure, the full payment is usually required at the time of booking.
 Keep on top of your booking. If you fail to receive a document or ticket on the date
promised, ask about it immediately. If you’re told that your reservation was can-
celed because of overbooking and you must pay extra for a confirmed and
rescheduled sailing, demand a full refund and/or contact your credit card com-
pany to stop payment.
When it comes time to sign on the dotted line, a good agent — someone
who’s sailed on or inspected a variety of ships and booked many cus-
tomers aboard in the past — can tell you which cabins have their views
obstructed by lifeboats, which cabins are near loud areas such as discos
and the engine room, which ships and itineraries you should avoid if
you’re not looking for a party vibe, and what the major differences are
between cabin categories. An experienced cruise agent can tell you
about special promotions (like free bottles of wine) and help out and act
as an intermediary should any problems arise with your booking, order
special extras such as a bottle of champagne in your cabin when you
arrive, and in general make your planning easy.

Chapter 4: Booking and Paying Up 53
Finding a good travel agent
So, how do you know if an agent is any good? Some are little more than
order-takers, who may never even have been on a cruise themselves.
One usually helpful resource is an agent referred to you by a reliable
friend or acquaintance. This is particularly valuable these days, when
agents are being pressed to squeeze more profit from every sale, making
some of them less likely to take the time to discuss options.
When searching for a good agent, it can’t hurt if an agent is an Accredited
Cruise Counselor (ACC), Master Cruise Counselor (MCC), or Elite Cruise
Counselor (ECC), designations doled out by the Cruise Lines International
Association (CLIA), an industry trade organization. Many of the cruise
lines’ Web sites list preferred agencies (generally broken down or
searchable by city or state), as does the CLIA site at www.cruising.org.
Many of the most reliable agencies are also members of agent groups,
such as Virtuoso and Signature Travel Network. In this book’s appendix,
we list some of the best agencies and also evaluate the major cruise-
selling Web sites.
Choosing Your Cabin
When it comes right down to it, choosing a cabin is really a question of
money. If you’ve got big bucks, you’re gonna get the penthouse. If you’ve
got just a few bucks, don’t fret, there are decent choices for you, too.
From a windowless lower-deck cabin with upper and lower bunks to a
1,400-square-foot suite with a butler and mile-long private veranda,
cruise ships can offer a dozen or more stateroom categories that differ
by size, location in the ship, amenities, and, of course, price.
For the most part, and especially on small ships, where most cabins are
virtually identical, cabins on higher decks are still generally more expen-
sive, and outside cabins (with windows or balconies) are more expen-
sive than inside cabins (those without). Outside cabins whose windows
are obstructed by lifeboats are cheaper than ones with good views.
Figure 4-1 shows a sample deck plan with some other considerations
when choosing a cabin.
For a closer look at a ship, go online for a virtual tour of its cabins and
public rooms. Most cruise lines offer an assortment of photos, videos,
and/or 360-degree tours online, but to save time, go to the Cruises Only
Web site, www.cruisesonly.com, which has visuals on almost all the
mainstream and luxe ships reviewed in this book. Click on “Cruise
Lines,” and then click on the little camera icons next to each ship.
Remember that cruise lines tend to show off their fancier suites and
cabins in these tours, and low-end staterooms, when shown, are pho-
tographed with a wide-angle lens that makes them look much bigger
than they really are.

Cabin Choice Considerations 
1 Make note of public areas that  
may be loud — the ship’s disco, for 
example. Although the nightclub on 
this ship is far from any cabins, it 
doesn’t hurt to request that your 
cabin not be close to or below such a 
sleep-inhibitor. 
2 Upper-deck cabins are not a good 
bet if you’re susceptible to 
seasickness because the upper 
decks feel more of the sea’s motion. 
3 The motion-sickness warning also 
holds for cabins in the ship’s bow. 
4 Outside cabins without verandas 
are represented as undivided 
rectangles. 
5 Outside cabins with verandas show 
up as divided rectangles. 
6 You can save big by booking an 
inside cabin without windows. 
7 The cabins least affected by the 
motion of the sea are amidships, 
especially cabins amidships on the 
lower levels. 
8 The cabins next to elevator shafts 
may be noisy. Of course, they’re also 
very convenient. 
9 Cabins in the stern can be affected 
by the motion of the sea, and also 
are prone to vibrations from the 
ship’s engines. 
10 Cabins near children’s areas may 
be fairly noisy during the day. 
11 Lifeboats sometimes obstruct the 
view from cabin windows. The 
lifeboats on this illustrated ship are 
near public rooms, so private cabins 
aren’t affected. 
12 Ideally, disabled vacationers have 
cabins near the ship’s entrance (13) 
and an elevator.

Evaluating cabin size
Inch for inch, cruise ship cabins are smaller than hotel rooms. Of course,
having a private balcony attached to your cabin, as many do, makes
your living space that much bigger. Figure 4-2 shows sample cabin floor
plans.
A roomy standard cabin is about 170 to 180 square feet, although some
of the smallest are about 85 to 100 square feet. Disney has some of the
more spacious standard cabins at sea, at 226 square feet (they call them
“family suites,” but they’re still the most common accommodation
aboard their ships). Carnival and Holland America’s are about 185
square feet, with some going up to a roomy 197 and 220 square feet,
respectively. By way of comparison, equivalent standard cabins on a
good number of ships in the Norwegian and Royal Caribbean lines are
sardine can-like — try 120 to 160 square feet. Cabins on the small-ship
lines such as Windjammer, Clipper, and American Canadian Caribbean
Line are downright closet sized — on the order of 70 to 100 square feet.
All standard cabins on the high-end lines are roomy — in fact, many of
the high-end ships are “suite only,” measuring between about 250 and
300 square feet, not including the balcony space. Across the board, from
mainstream to luxe, the top suites and penthouses are obviously the
most spacious, some as large as 2,000 and 3,000 square feet (and more).
If your budget calls for something a little smaller, think of your cabin like
a bedroom in a large house. It’ll be mostly a place you use only for sleep-
ing, showering, and changing clothes. Out beyond the door, vast acres of
public spaces await, full of diversions.
Getting the scoop on inside versus outside cabins
Whether you really plan to spend time in your cabin is a question that
should be taken into account when deciding whether to book an inside
cabin or an outside cabin (that is, one without windows or one with win-
dows or a balcony). If you plan to get up bright and early, hit the buffet
breakfast, and not stop till the cows come home, you can probably get
away with booking an inside cabin and save yourself a bundle. Inside
cabins are generally not as bad or as claustrophobic as they sound.
Many, in fact — such as those aboard most of the Carnival and Celebrity
fleets — are the same size as the outside cabins, and most cruise lines
design and decorate them to provide an illusion of light and space.
If, on the other hand, you want to lounge around and take it easy in your
cabin, maybe ordering breakfast from room service and eating while the
sun streams in — or, better yet, eating out in the sun, on your private
veranda — then an outside cabin is definitely a worthwhile investment.

Chapter 4: Booking and Paying Up 57
Typical outside cabins  
 
• Twin beds (can often be  
 
 pushed together) 
 
• Upper berths for extra  
 
 passengers fold into walls 
 
• Bathrooms usually have  
 
 showers only (no tub) 
 
• Usually (but not always)  
 
 have televisions and radios 
 
• May have portholes or  
 
 picture windows 
Typical suite configurations 
 
• Queen-size or double  
 
 beds 
 
• Sitting areas (sometimes  
 
 with sofa beds for extra  
 
 passengers) 
 
• Large bathrooms, usually  
 
 with tub 
 
• Refrigerators (sometimes  
 
 stocked, sometimes not) 
 
• Stereos and televisions   
 
 with VCRs are common 
 
• Large closets 
 
• Large windows or outside  
 
 verandas 
Figure 4-2: Sample cabin layouts.

If you want a view of the sea, be sure when booking that your window or
balcony doesn’t just give you a good view of a lifeboat or some other
obstruction (and remember, there are likely to be balconies on the deck
right above your balcony, so they’re more like porches than actual
verandas). Some cruise line brochures tell you which cabins are
obstructed, and a good travel agent or a cruise line’s reservation agent
can tell you which cabins on a particular ship may have this problem.
Considering other cabin matters
Unless you’re booking at the last minute (like a few weeks or less before
sailing), as part of a group, or in a cabin-share or cabin-guarantee pro-
gram (which means you agree to a price, and find out your exact cabin
at the last minute), you can work with your agent to pick an exact cabin.
Need a bathtub rather than just a shower? That narrows your choices on
most ships. Want connecting cabins so that you and your kids, friends,
or relatives can share space? Most ships have ’em, but they sometimes
book up early, as do cabins with third or fourth berths (usually pull-
down bunks or a sofa bed). Almost all ships have cabin TVs these days,
but a few don’t. Want an elevator close by, to make it easy to get
between decks? Is the view out the cabin’s windows obstructed by
lifeboats or other ship equipment? Most importantly, keep cabin posi-
tion in mind if you suffer from seasickness. A midships location on a
middle deck is best because it’s a kind of fulcrum point, the area least
affected by the vessel’s rocking and rolling in rough seas.
Booking Your Airfare
Except during special promotions, airfare is rarely included in cruise
rates for Caribbean, Alaska, Mexico, and New England/Canada cruises,
though it often is on Europe and Asia itineraries. So if you can’t drive to
your port of embarkation and need to fly to get to Miami, New York,
Southampton, or Rome, you have to either purchase airfare on your own
through an agent or online, or buy it as a package with your cruise. The
latter is often referred to as an air add-on or air-sea package.
Here are the benefits of booking your airfare through the cruise line:
 When you book through the cruise line, you usually get round-trip
transfers between the airport and the ship.
 A uniformed cruise line employee is in the airport to direct you 
to the right bus, and your luggage is taken from the airport to the
ship.
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
58

 The cruise line knows your airline schedule and, in the event of
delayed flights and other unavoidable snafus, does what they 
can to make sure you get to the ship. For instance, during the
abnormally fierce hurricane season in fall 2005, those who had
booked the cruise lines’ air were given priority when it came to
rebooking. People who book their air transportation and transfers
separately are on their own.
With pros, there are bound to be cons. Here are the downsides to book-
ing your airfare through the cruise line:
 Odds are it’s more expensive to book through the cruise line than
on your own. In the past, cruise lines offered more competitive
fares, but the airlines aren’t giving them the bulk discounts they
used to, meaning prices have gone up. Consequently, fewer passen-
gers are now booking the lines’ air packages.
 If you book through the lines, you probably can’t use any frequent-
flier miles you’ve accumulated.
 The air add-on could mean a circuitous route — with indirect legs
and layovers — before you arrive at your port of embarkation.
If you arrange your own air transportation, make absolutely sure that
airfare is not included as part of your cruise contract. Though rare, if it
is, you’re often granted a deduction (usually around $250 per person) off
the cruise fare. Passengers who book their own flights can still buy
transfers from the airport to the ship through their cruise line, but it’s
often cheaper to take a taxi, such as in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.
Making Dinner Reservations and 
Dealing with Special Diets
Though most ships have casual, walk-in restaurants that don’t require
reservations, most also still offer at least one outlet that operates the
traditional way with fixed early and late seating times. In this case, when
you book your cruise you must choose an early or late seating for
dinner, and sometimes even put in a request for the size table you’re
interested in (tables for two, four, eight, ten, and so on). Early usually
means a 6 p.m. seating, while late is anywhere between 8 and 8:30 p.m.
Families with young children often choose the early seating. The later
seatings allow you to linger a little longer over your meal, with no rush
set up for another group. For a more detailed discussion, see Chapter 7.
On all but the smallest luxury ships, it’s almost impossible to reserve a
table for two, considering the sheer numbers requesting the same. Still,
it can’t hurt to ask.
Most ships now offer vegetarian meals and health-conscious choices as
part of their daily menus. If you follow any other special diet — whether
Chapter 4: Booking and Paying Up 59

low-salt, low-fat, heart-healthy, kosher, halal, or any other — or if you
have certain food allergies, make this known to your travel agent when
you book, or at least 30 or more days before the cruise, and make sure
your diet can be accommodated at all three meals (sometimes special
meal plans cover only breakfast and dinner). If you’re sailing on a small
ship and have special food needs, definitely tell your agent.
Extending the Trip
Cruise lines often offer hotel packages in the cities of embarkation and
debarkation, and because most of these cities are tourist attractions in
their own right, you may want to spend some time in New York, Oahu, or
London before you sail, or drive to Disney World from Port Canaveral.
The cruise lines’ package deals usually include hotel stays and trans-
portation from the hotel to the ship (before the cruise) or from the
docks to the hotel (after the cruise). Compare what the line is offering
with what you may be able to arrange on your own.
Considering Cancellations and Insurance
Given world’s wacky geopolitical situation these days, it pays to have a
handle on a cruise line’s cancellation and insurance policies. What should
you do if the cruise you’ve booked is canceled before it departs? A cruise
can be canceled because of shipyard delays (if you’ve booked an inaugu-
ral cruise), the outbreak of an infectious disease, mechanical breakdowns
(such as nonfunctioning air-conditioning or an engine fire), the cruise line
going out of business, act of war, or an impending hurricane.
Luckily, given today’s competitive market, cruise lines have been making
big efforts to appease disappointed passengers, whether they bought
insurance or not. Typically, a line will reschedule the canceled cruise
and offer passengers big discounts on future cruises — after all, they
don’t want the bad press they’d get if they cheated hundreds or thou-
sands of people. There are, however, no set rules on how a line will com-
pensate you in the event of a cancellation.
If the shoe’s on the other foot and you need to cancel, you can generally
get a refund — most lines give you every cent back if you cancel at least
two to three months before your departure date, although details vary
from line to line. If you cancel closer to departure, you can usually get a
partial refund up until about 15 days before the cruise. After that, you
won’t get any refund at all, even if you cancel for medical reasons. In
recent times, temporary exceptions have been made when a major
world event negatively impacted travel planning. For example, in early
2003, in response to the impending war with Iraq and the general uneasi-
ness in the Middle East, many lines liberalized their cancellation and
insurance policies for their European cruises, and, in some cases, all
their itineraries, in order to encourage bookings.
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
60

Chapter 4: Booking and Paying Up 61
If you’re just worried about missing the ship, go a day early and spend
your money on a hotel and nice dinner instead. If you’re worried about
medical problems occurring during your trip, on the other hand, travel
insurance may be more vital.
Except for the small coastal cruisers described in Chapter 13, most
cruise ships have an infirmary staffed by a doctor and a nurse or two;
but in the event of a dire illness, the ship’s medical staff can only do so
much. Therefore, you may want a policy that covers emergency medical
evacuation and, if your regular insurance doesn’t cover it, the potential
cost of major medical treatment while away from home.
Cruise line policies versus third-party insurers
A good travel agent can tell you about policies sold through the cruise
lines and ones sold independently of the lines. No matter which you
choose, it’s absolutely crucial to read the fine print because terms vary
from policy to policy, although the following information usually applies
to all policies:
 Both kinds typically reimburse you in some way when your trip is
affected by unexpected events (such as canceled flights, plane
crashes, dockworkers’ strikes, or the illness or death of a loved
one, as late as the day before or day of departure) but not by “acts
of God,” such as hurricanes and earthquakes (the exception being
if your home is made uninhabitable, putting you in no mood to con-
tinue with your cruise plans).
 Both also typically cover cancellation of the cruise for medical rea-
sons (yours or a family member’s); medical emergencies during the
cruise, including evacuation from the ship; lost or damaged lug-
gage; and a cruise missed due to airline delays (though some only
cover delays over three hours).
 Neither kind of policy reimburses you if your travel agent goes
bankrupt, so using a travel agent you’re very familiar with or who
has been recommended to you is the safest precaution you can
take. (And, of course, always use a credit card, never a check. If a
corrupt travel agent cashes it, or a decent one just goes out of busi-
ness, then you could get screwed.)
 Most cancellation policies also do not cover cancellations due to
work requirements.
Third-party coverage
Even though agents get a commission for selling both cruise line policies
and independent policies, most agents and industry insiders believe that
non–cruise line policies are the best bet because some will issue insurance
to those with pre-existing medical conditions if the condition is stable
when purchasing the insurance (a doctor would have to verify this if you
ever made a claim) and if you purchase the policy within 14 days of your
initial deposit on the cruise. They also offer supplier-default coverage that

Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
62
kicks in if a cruise line goes bankrupt, which a handful did between 2000
and 2003.
Though bankruptcies are rare, a well-connected travel agent should see
the writing on the wall months before a cruise line fails — commissions
slow or stop being paid, phone calls aren’t returned, and industry trade
publications report on any problems — and tip you off. The less cus-
tomer-service-driven cruise sellers may not stop pushing a troubled
cruise line, however, selling these lines up to the very last minute.
According to the Fair Credit Billing Act, if you paid by credit card (and
again, you should), you can generally get your money back if you dis-
pute the charge within 60 days of the date the charge first appears. If
you paid in full four months before the cruise, you’re likely out of luck
going this route and may have to resort to litigation.
Policies are available from reputable insurers such as Access America,
Box 71533, Richmond, VA 23286 (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.
com), and Travel Guard International, 1145 Clark St., Stevens Point, WI
54481 (% 800-826-4919; www.travelguard.com), whose Web sites
maintain lists of the lines they cover (or no longer cover); these are
helpful in figuring out which lines may be considered financially shaky.
Cruise line coverage
Cruise lines offer their own policies, many of them administered by 
New York–based based BerkelyCare (% 800-797-4514). If you opt for
this type of policy out of sheer convenience (the cost is added right
onto your cruise fare), keep in mind that they do not cover you in the
event of a cruise line bankruptcy (though using a credit card can save
you here; see the “Cruise line policies versus third-party insurers” sec-
tion earlier in this chapter) or for cancellation of your cruise due to pre-
existing medical conditions. Some lines’ policies issue a cruise credit for
the penalty amount if a medical claim is deemed pre-existing, and issue
you cash if you cancel for a covered reason.
Generally, the cancellation penalty imposed by the cruise line would be
100 percent of the cruise fare, for example, if you cancel a few days
before the cruise (assuming you’ve paid in full), or it could be just $300
if you cancel right after making the initial cruise deposit.
Sounds like the third-party policies win hands down, right? Well, to make
it just a little more complicated, a handful of cruise line policies are actu-
ally better in some areas than outside policies. For example, Princess
Cruises has an insurance policy that allows you to cancel for all the 
reasons that an outside policy would (illness, injury) and get cash reim-
bursement or they will let you cancel for any reason whatsoever (from
fear of flying to a bad hair day) up until the day of departure and have 
75 percent to 90 percent of the normal penalty for canceling your cruise
applied toward a future trip. Norwegian, Celebrity, Royal Caribbean, and
Silversea offer similar “any reason” policies.

Chapter 4: Booking and Paying Up 63
Putting Down a Deposit
If you book at the last minute, you typically pay in full when making your
reservation. If you book several months or more ahead of time, then you
pay a deposit to secure the booking. Depending on the policy of the line
you selected, the amount is either fixed at a predetermined amount or
represents a percentage of the ticket’s total cost. The length of time
cruise lines hold a cabin without a deposit is getting shorter by the
minute. It seems pretty clear, in this age of near-obsessive “shopping
around,” that the cruise lines are doing their part to discourage it. It
used to be a cruise could be held for a week before you had to plunk
down cash; most lines have now shortened this window to one to three
days (exceptions include exotic itineraries that aren’t ultracompetitive).
Carnival, for instance, now requires a deposit within 24 hours.
The balance of the cruise price is due anywhere from about 60 to 90
days before you depart; holiday cruises may require final payments 
earlier, perhaps 90 days before departure.
Credit card payments are made directly to the cruise line, but payments
by check are made out to the agency, which then passes payment on to
the cruise line. As we’ve said repeatedly in this chapter, it’s preferable
by far to pay by credit card, for the added protection it offers.
Reviewing Your Tickets
Carefully review your ticket, invoice, itinerary, and/or vouchers to con-
firm that they accurately reflect the departure date, ship, and cabin cate-
gory you booked. The printout usually lists a specific cabin number; if it
doesn’t, it designates a cabin category. Your exact cabin location will
then be assigned to you when you board ship.

Your cruise is paid for and you think you’re ready to go. But are you?
Before you head to the airport or hop in your car, you may have
some chores to do. Do you have the ID you need to get on board? Are
your cruise tickets and other documents in order? Have you figured out
your spending-money situation so that you can pay for stuff on board
and at the ports? You need a checklist. Wow! You’re in luck. We’ve made
one for you right here. (Well, not an actual one, but you get the general
idea.)
Identifying Yourself
Ah, the old days. Not long ago we watched the 1970s disaster movie
Airport, and there was a scene in which Helen Hayes cons her way onto a
departing jet by saying her son had dropped his wallet before he
boarded. Could she go aboard to give it to him? Sure, they said. Go on
through.
It ain’t that way anymore. Today you need an ID to get into some office
buildings, let alone planes, so it should come as no surprise you need ID
to get aboard ship, too — and probably a passport, as well. For decades,
U.S.-based cruise ships operated under rules that permitted U.S. citizens
to travel to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean without need of a pass-
port, but that’s all changing. On December 31, 2006, the first phase of the

Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (part of the Intelligence Reform
and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004) will require U.S. citizens to pos-
sess a valid passport for all air or sea travel to or from Canada, Mexico,
Central and South America, the Caribbean and Bermuda — no ifs, ands,
or buts. On December 31, 2007, the second phase of the initiative will
extended the passport requirement to all land border crossings as well.
This means even passengers taking weekend jaunts to the Bahamas
need a passport, as do passengers boarding ship in Vancouver for their
Alaska cruise.
The bottom line? Get a passport if you’re planning any kind of cruise
that leaves U.S. territorial waters. Don’t dilly-dally either, since U.S. pass-
port services are likely to be deluged when the new rules take effect.
Passport applications generally take six to eight weeks to process,
though expedited service is also available (see below).
If you don’t currently have a passport, the State Department Web site
(http://travel.state.gov/passport) provides information on
obtaining one. Current fees for new passports are $97 adult, $82 children
under 16. Renewals cost $67.
To get a passport for the first time (or if you have an expired passport
issued more than 15 years ago, or issued while you were under 16), you
need to go in person to one of the more than 7,000 passport acceptance
facilities located throughout the country, bringing two photographs of
yourself, proof of U.S. citizenship (an expired passport, certified birth
certificate, naturalization certificate, certificate of citizenship, or con-
sular report of birth abroad), and a valid form of photo ID, such as a
driver’s license. Acceptance facilities include many federal, state, and
probate courts, post offices, some public libraries, and a number of
county and municipal offices. Find the one nearest you using the State
Department’s search page at http://iafdb.travel.state.gov.
Citizens who need a new passport for travel within two weeks may 
visit any of the 15 regional passport agencies listed at http://travel.
state.gov/passport/about/agencies/agencies_913.html.
Appointments are required, and you need to bring a completed pass-
port application (downloadable at http://travel.state.gov/
passport/forms/forms_847.html), appropriate ID, proof of citizen-
ship (see list above), and two regulation passport-size photos. Expedited
service costs $60 plus any mailing fees, above and beyond the regular
application fees.
If you don’t live near a passport center, you can apply for expedited
service at a local passport acceptance facility, located in post offices,
courthouses, and so on, and then follow up through overnight mail.
Chapter 5: Ticking Off Your Pre-Cruise Checklist 65

You can renew an expired passport through the mail as long as you were
over age 16 when it was issued and still have the same name (or can pro-
vide legal documentation of a name change), and your old passport is
undamaged and was issued within the past 15 years. Forms are down-
loadable at http://travel.state.gov/passport/forms/forms_
847.html.
When traveling, carry a photocopy of your passport in a separate piece
of luggage from your real one. If you lose your passport while abroad, go
directly to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Bring all the forms of
identification you have so that the officials can start generating you a
new passport.
Reviewing Your Cruise Documents
Your tickets and other cruise documents usually arrive in your mailbox
about a month before your cruise. Sometimes, however, they don’t get
to you until a week before your cruise. Plenty of important items are
included, such as:
 Your airline tickets (if you bought them from the cruise line)
 A boarding document that contains your cabin assignment (or at
least your cabin category) and sometimes your dining table 
assignment
 Boarding forms to fill out
 Luggage tags
 Vouchers for transportation between the airport and the port 
(if you arranged for this option)
 A booklet describing the shore excursions available on your trip,
which you may be able to book ahead of time
 Another booklet with emergency phone numbers and answers to
frequently asked questions, such as what kind of power outlets 
are in your cabin, what kind of laundry services are available, and
so on
Read through your documents carefully and verify the info. Confirm that
your cabin category is correct, as well as your dining preferences (on
ships that still do formal, fixed-seating dining). Check that your airline
tickets show the correct flights and arrival times. And definitely make
sure that you’ve got enough time to reach the port at least a few hours
before the ship is scheduled to depart.
When the big day arrives, keep your cruise documents with you in your
purse, briefcase, or carryon.

66

Paying Up: Paper or Plastic?
Cruising is like Monopoly: It feels like you’re playing with funny money.
It’s only at the end that reality hits.
Spending on board
With the exception of some of the small ships discussed in Chapter 13,
cruise vessels operate on a cashless basis from day to day. What that
means is that everything you buy on board, from bar drinks to shore
excursions to spa treatments and dinners at extra-cost restaurants, is
put on your tab, to be paid at the end of the trip. Most small ships just
mark down your purchases by hand throughout the cruise, but main-
stream and luxury ships will issue you an onboard charge card, which
on most ships also serves as your room key and as your cruise ID.
Shortly before or after you first come aboard, a purser or check-in clerk
will take an imprint of your credit card and issue you your onboard
charge card. You also have the option of using cash, traveler’s checks, or
sometimes personal checks to pay your account, but if you decide to
pay cash, you probably have to put down a deposit of at least $250.
On the last night of your cruise, you get an itemized account of all
you’ve charged. If you don’t dispute the charges, they’re automatically
billed to your credit card. If you’re paying in cash or if you dispute any
charge, you need to stop by the office of the ship’s cashier or purser.
There may be a long line, so don’t go if you don’t have to.
The only time you may need cash on board is at the end of the cruise,
when (depending on the cruise line’s policies) you may be leaving tips
for your cabin steward, dining steward, and other staff. You may also
want to keep some cash on hand to use in the laundry room (if your ship
has one). In general, you need cash for the casino, but often ships allow
you to charge gambling dollars to your shipboard account, up to a cer-
tain amount per day.
If you find that you need more cash, some ships have their own ATMs —
often located, not surprisingly, in the casino. The ATMs give out U.S. dol-
lars, though fees are typically higher than ATMs on shore.
Settling up on shore
Almost all the stores at the ports take credit cards, and most restaurants
do, too, but you need some cash on hand to pay for taxis, to buy small
items and snacks, and to tip tour guides. Small bills are best.
Pretty much all the Caribbean, Mexican, and Canadian ports we describe
in Part V accept U.S. dollars. If you want to use the local currency, you
can often find ATMs, bureaux de change, and banks close to the docks.
ATMs are your best bet, as their exchange rates are most favorable —
just be sure you have some idea of the exchange rate ahead of time, so
Chapter 5: Ticking Off Your Pre-Cruise Checklist 67

you know how much you’re taking out. In Europe, you need to convert
your dollars to euros (or pounds, in Britain).
To check conversion rates before your trip, use the “Quick Cross Rates”
table and currency calculator at www.xe.com.
Using ATMs means that you don’t have to carry large amounts of trav-
eler’s checks or cash from the United States, but we usually carry some
cash anyway, as an emergency reserve.
Before you leave home, be sure any cash you intend to access is in the
checking part of your account if your ATM card allows you to access
both savings and checking — some foreign machines allow you to with-
draw only from your checking account and don’t offer you the option of
transferring money between accounts.
You can find ATMs at most ports — even the tiny ones. Don’t take out
more money than you need that day or you may end up with a bunch of
bills that you have to convert back at the end of your trip. Also, remem-
ber that you can’t convert coins, so spend those first.
Personal checks are pretty much useless for cruise travel purposes,
except as accepted on your ship (check with the cruise line for its policy
on personal checks).
Decking Yourself Out: What to Pack
Some people worry about packing for vacations. Don’t. Seriously, you
probably have everything you need right in your closet. Over the past
several years, cruises have gotten more and more casual, attire-wise.
Understanding shipboard dress codes 
(such as they are)
Back around the dawn of the 21st century, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL)
looked at the cruise business, saw that pretty much every line had stuck
with a mix of formal, informal, and casual nights for the past, oh, hun-
dred years, and then said, “Screw it. We’re going casual.” The move
started a stampede, with many other lines either toning down or scrap-
ping their own dress codes.
Today, no matter what the itinerary, you can find people spending their
days in T-shirts, polo shirts, shorts or khakis, plus casual dresses for
women and sweat shirts or light sweaters to compensate for the air-
conditioning. The vibe is about the same on the luxury lines, though
those polos and khakis probably sport better labels. If you’re going on
an Alaskan or other cold-weather cruise, pack sweat shirts or fleece,
jeans, comfortable (and preferably waterproof) walking shoes, and a
light jacket and/or a waterproof jacket. In the evenings, people typically
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
68

dress up, but not to the tux-and-gown level they used to. A lot of main-
stream lines still have two traditional formal nights during any 7-night
itinerary, but most men opt for dark suits over real formalwear, while
women dress in cocktail dresses, sequined jackets, gowns, or the like.
Some other lines are ditching the formal concept entirely. The closest
NCL comes is an “optional formal” captain’s cocktail night, though it’s
totally up to you what you decide to wear — just no shorts in the dining
rooms, please. Aboard all the small-ship lines we discuss in Chapter 13,
such as Windstar and Oceania, it’s very rare to see anything dressier
than a sport jacket at any time, and those usually appear only for the
captain’s dinner. Most of these lines are all-casual all the time.
On lines that still have delineated formal, informal, and casual nights,
here’s the scoop:
 Formal nights: Imagine what you’d wear to a nice wedding: tuxe-
dos or dark suits for men; cocktail dresses, sequined jackets,
gowns, or other fancy attire for women.
 Informal (or semiformal) nights: Suits or sport jackets and ties for
men; stylish dresses or pantsuits for women.
 Casual nights: Decent pants and collared shirts for men, and
maybe a sport jacket; dresses, skirts, or pantsuits for women.
Suggested dress for the evening is usually printed in the ship’s daily
schedule. Cruise lines also usually describe their dress codes in their
brochures, on their Web sites, and in one of the booklets you get with
your cruise tickets.
Planning for appliances and other odds and ends
If you plan to bring electronic devices, check the information you
receive with your tickets to find out about the power situation on board.
Not all ships use 110 current (although most in North American fleets
do). Even if the ship is 110, you may find only two-pronged jacks rather
than three-pronged, so you may need an adapter. And if you stay at a for-
eign hotel before or after your cruise, you may need a converter kit and
different plugs.
Most ships provide hair dryers, though they’re frequently low-powered
models. If you use one regularly, and have a lightweight model, it can’t
hurt to bring it along. Just be careful where you plug it in. Some cabin
outlets won’t handle heat-producing devices such as dryers, curling
irons, and the like.
Here are some other things for you to consider:
 Most cabins come with toiletries such as soap and shampoo, and
sometimes conditioner and lotion, although you still may want to
bring your own favorite products. If you forget something, all but a
few of the smallest ships have a shop on board selling razor blades,
Chapter 5: Ticking Off Your Pre-Cruise Checklist 69

toothbrushes, sunscreen, film, and other sundries, usually at
inflated prices.
 Except for the small ships, most vessels have a laundry service and
some dry cleaning, too, with generally about a 24-hour turnaround
time. A price list will be in your cabin. Some ships also have self-
service laundry rooms.
 Most ships have a telephone wake-up service, but you may prefer
to bring your alarm clock.
 Don’t bother with a beach towel. Most cruise lines provide them for
you to take ashore.
 A couple of large freezer-style, reclosable plastic bags come in
handy for protecting your camera and/or binoculars if you partici-
pate in water activities, such as kayaking. And you can also use
them to pack damp bathing suits for the trip home.
 If you want to bring your own gear for sports such as golf or scuba
diving, check with your airline about how to transport such items.
 Bring plenty of film, memory disks, and/or batteries for your
camera, and blank cassettes for your camcorder. Merchants will
gouge you for this stuff at touristy areas.
 Learn from our mistakes: Don’t take brand-new shoes that you
haven’t broken in. (Or pack a bunch of adhesive bandages if you do.)
 Airport security forbids the use of locks on your luggage. If you’re
worried about your bags just popping open, you can secure the zip-
pers with keychain rings or the kind of twistie ties used to close
bread bags. Security can take them off easily if they need to get in.
Packing your carry-on
Your carry-on bag (whether you’re carrying it on the plane or just onto
the ship) should contain everything you think you may need for the day,
in case your checked luggage is delayed. Be sure to pack the following:
 Big important documents, including your passport, driver’s license,
airline tickets, cruise tickets, boarding forms, and claim checks for
airport parking
 Currency, including credit and debit cards and cash and/or trav-
eler’s checks
 House and car keys
 Valuables, such as jewelry, binoculars, cameras, iPods or Walkmen,
and video equipment
 Eyeglasses and any prescription medicines you may need during
your trip
 A change of clothes
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
70

 Motion-sickness medication if you think you may need it, plus hard
candy or chewing gum if you have problems with plugged ears on
takeoff and landing
 Snacks if you’re flying one of those Scrooge-like airlines that have
cut back on food service over the past few years
Keeping in Touch at Sea
In case you’re worried about staying in touch with loved ones, work, or
the sports scores while you’re away, calm down. Today it’s easy — some
people would say too easy — to stay connected while at sea. Whatever
happened to getting away from it all, anyway? In addition to the news
channels on most cabin TVs, some ships still maintain the old tradition of
printing the day’s top news stories and slipping them under passengers’
doors each morning. And then, of course, there are all the gadgets . . .
Cellphone service
Beginning in 2004, technology became available that allows cellphone
users to make and receive calls while aboard ship, even when far out at
sea. Costa Cruises was the first to introduce it, and at press time
Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Regent Seven Seas,
Oceania, Silversea, and Crystal Cruises (Crystal Serenity only) are all
either wired up or scheduled to be by the end of 2006.
Service is available to most passengers with GSM phones that operate at
900 MHz and 1900 MHz, which are common in the United States. In addi-
tion to regular voice and text messaging, the service — which kicks in
once a ship sails beyond range of shoreside towers — lets passengers
with data-capable GSM/GPRS devices access data services such as
e-mail and picture messaging. Passengers are billed by the carrier to
which they subscribe at roaming rates set by that carrier, just as if they
were roaming on land instead of at sea. Though each user’s carrier sets
its own rates, expect charges of roughly $1.70 per minute.
Satellite phones
As they have for years, cruise ships continue to offer satellite phone
service from their cabins, usually for about $8 or $9 per minute, though
it can climb as high as $15 a minute.
In addition to cabin sat-phones and cell service, each ship has a central
phone number, fax number, and e-mail address, which you can some-
times find in the cruise line’s brochure and usually in the documents you
get with your tickets. Distribute these to family members or friends in
case they have to contact you in an emergency, but be sure they know
the numbers are only for emergencies, since they can easily cost $30 to
$40 for just a minute or two.
Chapter 5: Ticking Off Your Pre-Cruise Checklist 71

It also can’t hurt to leave behind the numbers of the cruise line’s head-
quarters and/or reservations department, both of whom can put people
in touch with you in an emergency situation.
Internet and e-mail at sea
Aside from most of the small, adventure-oriented ships in Chapter 13,
pretty much every cruise ship has an Internet center where passengers
can surf and e-mail to their wallet’s content, at rates calculated on a per-
minute basis (usually between 50¢ and $1) or in pre-purchased blocks
(say, $40 for a 3- or 4-night cruise or $90 for a 7-night cruise).
E-mail access is usually available through the Web via your Earthlink,
AOL, Hotmail, Yahoo!, or other personal account. Some lines also let you
set up an account aboard ship, if you don’t already have your own.
Many ships built over the past several years (including the newest
Celebrity, Crystal, Costa, Holland America, NCL, Oceania, Royal
Caribbean, Cunard, Regent, SeaDream, and Silversea ships) have been
wired with dataports in all, most, or some cabins and suites, allowing
passengers who travel with laptops to log on in privacy. The cost for
these services tends to be higher than access in the Internet centers.
Wireless Internet (Wi-Fi) is also offered aboard all the Carnival, Holland
America, NCL, and Princess vessels, usually in the atrium and other des-
ignated public rooms. A few ships — the small luxury ships of Seabourn
and the huge new Carnival Valor — offer wireless access everywhere on
board. To take advantage of this service, you must have a wireless card
for your laptop (or you can rent a card, or a laptop), then purchase min-
utes either as you need them or in packages of 33 to 500 minutes.
Confirming Your Flight
Air arrival and departure times are always subject to change, so take a
minute to call and confirm your flight a day or two before your depar-
ture. You can also call the day you’re scheduled to leave, to avoid having
to wait around the airport if your flight is delayed.
If you follow any special diets, whether vegetarian, kosher, or otherwise,
call the airline in advance to make sure you’ll be fed appropriately on
the plane. Different airlines require different lead times to arrange spe-
cial meals, but you can bet on the minimum being 24 hours in advance.
Call early.
Get to the airport early. For domestic flights, plan to get there two full
hours before your plane is scheduled to depart. For international flights,
you may want to get in a little earlier than that. In the worst-case sce-
nario, it saves you stress if lines are long at check-in and security. If lines
are short, it gives you time to drink beer and eat nachos at the airport
bar. So what’s the downside?
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
72

Remembering Other Important Stuff
Some things to keep in mind before you walk out the door:
 Read all the pre-trip material the cruise line provides you. Do
you have your passport and other ID? Also, fill out (or at least think
about filling out) the boarding forms they sent. You can also do this
on the plane, or when waiting at the terminal.
 Make photocopies of your passport, your airline tickets, and any
credit cards you plan to use just in case they get separated from
you for any reason. Pack the copies in your luggage separately
from the actual documents (which should be in your carryon). You
may also want to leave another set of copies with a friend.
 Write down the ship’s phone number (it should be included with
your cruise documents), and leave the number and a copy of
your itinerary with a friend or relative.
 Put luggage tags on your bags. The cruise line will send you a set
with your cruise documents, and you’ll have to fill them out with
your departure date and port, cabin number, and so on and affix to
each bag so they can be delivered to your cabin.
 Be sure to put your name and address inside your bags, too, just
in case your luggage tags fall off.
 Don’t carry scissors, razor blades, or any other sharp objects in
your hand luggage. Ditto for grenades, poison gas, or toxic waste.
You can pack the former in your checked luggage, but not the
latter. Regulations on what you can and can’t bring with you on the
plane seem to be changing all the time. The latest no-go? Cigarette
lighters. We’ve even been stopped for a tiny little wrench, no more
than three inches long. Seems you can’t bring any tools onto a
plane. Who knew?
 If no one will be at home while you’re away, you may want to
call the post office and arrange for it to hold your mail. Ditto for
any newspapers you have delivered.

Cruise Experience

In this part . . . 
T
his is what cruising is all about: drinking beer in the hot
tub, loading a mountain of food onto your buffet platter,
and joining really stupid pool games. No, wait, this is what
cruising is all about: going to a wine-tasting session, eating
sushi at a high-toned Asian restaurant, and attending a lec-
ture on the history of transatlantic passenger sailing. No,
wait, this . . . well anyway, whatever cruising is about for you,
we cover it here, along with practicalities such as how to nav-
igate embarkation day and how to navigate the cruise lines’
variety of programs for kids and teens.

I
s your day-to-day life as stressful as ours? If so, that cruise you signed
up for months ago has probably snuck right up on you. Look at that!
It starts tomorrow, and here you are reading this chapter just now.
Luckily, there’s nothing about the boarding process that you won’t be
able to negotiate with aplomb after you get through this patented Matt-
and-Heidi “Coming Aboard” Aplomb-O-Mizer. Ready, get set . . .
Getting to Your Port of Embarkation
So you’re about to begin your trip. Because the cruise lines are home-
porting their ships in several dozen places now instead of from just a
few hub cities, you may be driving or flying to your ship.
Pack your suitcases and don’t forget to attach an ID tag with your name
and address, and maybe your cellphone number. Attach the bag tags
your cruise line sent you, too, which include your sailing date and cabin
number.
If you’re flying
Call the airline before you leave home to ensure that your flight is on
schedule. Also, allow yourself ample time at the airport to check your
bags and get through security screening.
Keep your tickets, cruise documents, passport and other identification,
keys, valuable items, and medicines in a bag you can carry onto the
plane and ship with you, rather than check through. You may also want
to pack a light change of clothes, as a precaution in case you and your
checked luggage get separated.

When you arrive at your destination airport, cruise line representatives
stand at the ready at baggage claim, holding signs bearing your line’s or
ship’s name, waiting to direct you to buses bound for the terminal. You
probably already paid for bus transfers to the ship when you bought
your cruise. If not, you can arrange them now or take a taxi.
If you’ve flown to another country, you need to clear Immigration and
Customs, which includes showing your passport and any forms you
were given on the plane. Follow the appropriate signs. The cruise line
reps will be waiting when you get through the checkpoints.
Arranging transfers through the cruise line
If you booked transfers to the ship through the cruise line, the man or
woman with the sign will direct you and your bags to the bus or van that
will take you to the ship. If you haven’t done so already, fill out the lug-
gage tags the cruise line sent with your tickets (listing your ship name,
sailing date, and cabin number), and put one on each of your bags. The
bus driver usually asks for your transportation voucher, which you also
received with your cruise documents. After you arrive at the port, you
have to ID your luggage and check it in. You usually find an army of
porters to assist you (for a suggested tip of about $2 per bag) and
another army of cruise line employees waiting to direct you to the
check-in desks.
Handling transfers on your own
If you didn’t book the cruise line transfers, gather your luggage from the
baggage area and head to the pier via taxi or whatever other mode of
transportation you’ve arranged.
Find out in advance what the trip from the airport to the port should
cost to avoid getting ripped off. Many airports post information like that
on their Web sites. Don’t forget to put the luggage tags from the cruise
line on your bags.
Some cities have multiple piers, and you can help your cab driver by
having the pier number and directions to the ship handy. The cruise line
should include this information with your documents. If not, you can get
it in advance by contacting the line.
Dealing with a delayed flight
If your flight is delayed, don’t panic. Let the airline personnel know that
you’re a cruise passenger who has a ship to catch that day. They may be
able to put you on a different flight.
If you’ve bought air transportation through the cruise line, the airline
may already know you have a cruise to catch and will try to make other
arrangements, and the cruise line will probably be tracking your progress
as well. In any case, have the cruise line’s emergency number handy (it’s
listed in your cruise documents) just in case you or the airline needs to
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
78

get in touch. If there’s a forced overnight, the airline typically pays for
your hotel room. If there’s a weather delay, air/sea guests are given prior-
ity on standby flights to the port of embarkation, but airlines are unlikely
to provide hotel accommodations.
If you haven’t booked your air travel with the cruise line, you need to
work with the airline to catch your ship in the next port, as well as con-
tact the cruise line to tell them about your situation. In cases like this, it
helps if you’ve bought travel insurance that includes a trip-delay benefit.
See Chapter 4 for more information about travel insurance.
Dealing with lost luggage
If you and your luggage get separated in transit, tell your airline you’re
about to board a cruise. If they can’t get it to you before your ship
departs, they’ll ship it to your first port of call. If you don’t get missing
luggage the first night, you can get an overnight kit, with such items as a
toothbrush, toothpaste, and a razor, from the purser’s office.
If you’ve checked your luggage in with the ship but it never shows up in
your cabin, contact the reception desk. Most likely your luggage tags fell
off and your bags are waiting somewhere on board.
If you’re driving
If you’ve driven to the port, it’s just a matter of parking and trundling
your luggage into the terminal. Most ports have secure parking available
on-site (or at least close by), usually costing $10 to $12 per day.
Checking In at the Pier
What happens when you reach the cruise terminal depends on the ship,
but the check-in process can sometimes be slow as molasses — though
sometimes it’s smooth as silk.
Preparing to board
If it’s still morning or early afternoon, don’t feel rushed. Remember,
another shipload of passengers is probably just getting off from the
ship’s last trip, and cabins still need to be cleaned, supplies loaded, and
paperwork and Customs documents completed properly before you can
board. Even if your ship has been berthed since 6 a.m., new passengers
are often not allowed on board until about 1 p.m. Some cruise lines have
begun offering a preboarding option, which means you can get on at 11 a.m.
or noon, have lunch, and start checking out the ship, though your cabin
probably won’t be ready till early afternoon.
Beyond the simple joy of feeling that your vacation has started, coming
aboard early affords you some advantages, such as getting choice
appointment times at the spa, signing up for popular shore excursions,
and getting reservations for dinner at the alternative restaurants. Note,
Chapter 6: Embarkation Day 79

though, that a lot of cruise lines now let passengers pre-book some or all
of these, either online or by phone, so you may be able to sign up before
you even sail. (See Chapter 4 for details.)
Whether you board early or late, you have to wait in some kind of line to
get your paperwork cleared. Before you do, make sure that you fill out
all the documents the cruise line sent you — the ones marked “Be sure
to fill these out in advance.” You may also want to tidy yourself up a bit,
because there’s sure to be a ship’s photographer lurking somewhere
nearby to take one of those “coming aboard” shots, although you can
simply wave them off if you don’t want your picture taken.
Checking in
During the check-in process, a cruise line rep examines your tickets and
ID and sets you up with a shipboard ID and an onboard account.
Regarding IDs, new State Department and Homeland Security regulations
that go into effect in January 2007 mean you absolutely, positively need a
passport to go on any cruise that visits a foreign port, even if it’s just the
Bahamas. If you’re sailing an Alaska cruise, you may need one, too, if the
trip departs from or ends in Vancouver. See Chapter 5 for more info about
getting your passport. On itineraries that visit multiple countries, your
ship often holds your passport to facilitate clearance procedures. Don’t
worry. It’s normal. You get your passport back when you go ashore.
Shipboard accounts are essentially credit cards you use for everything
you buy on board: drinks, shore excursions, spa treatments, and so on.
To set ’em up, the cruise line rep usually takes an imprint of your credit
card, though you also have the option of leaving a cash or traveler’s
check deposit (usually $250) and settling the difference at the end of
your cruise. Usually, the shipboard ID you’re issued at check-in doubles
as your onboard charge card. Often it’s also your room key. If not, you
either get your key now or pick it up in your cabin.
Keep your shipboard ID with you at all times. Not only do you need it for
any purchases you make on board (except aboard some small ships,
where they just jot down your name when you buy something), but you
also need it as ID every time you get on or off your ship in port.
On ships that still follow traditional fixed-seating dining, check-in is often
when you get your dining-room table assignment, too (see Chapter 7 for
more about this), though you may also have received it with your tick-
ets. Either way, make sure your seating time (early or late) and table size
are as you want. If not, talk to someone now. If your ship follows a more
casual dining approach, you don’t have to worry about any of this.
If you booked a suite or have mobility problems, you may get priority
check-in and embarkation. Otherwise, boarding lines generally form
alphabetically by last name.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
80

Stepping aboard and checking out your digs
All passengers must clear security just before boarding ship. This involves
stepping through a metal detector, having your hand luggage X-rayed, and
handing over your shipboard ID for the first time so that you’re officially
counted as “on board.” From here, a crewmember directs you to your
cabin, where it makes sense to spend a little time checking things out.
Your cabin steward may stop by to see that everything is okay and that
you know how everything works. Let the steward know if anything seems
amiss, or if you have any special needs — extra pillows, for example — or
whether you want the beds separate or pushed together.
Don’t be put off by the big WHOOSH!!! of the toilet. Ships typically use
vacuum toilets, which sound as if they could drag you down if you’re not
careful. Don’t put any foreign objects into the bowl other than the toilet
paper provided — they can clog up the works, creating what’s techni-
cally known as “a big mess.”
A daily program in your cabin tells you what’s on tap for the rest of the
day, including meal times and dress codes, where applicable.
Your bags may not arrive at your cabin until after the ship leaves the
pier, but don’t be concerned. On the bigger ships, the crew may have to
deliver 5,000 or more bags, which can take time. Because of this, dinner
on the first night is always casual. If you start to worry as the night goes
on, give the purser’s office a call.
A few other bits of info you should know:
 Tap water on ships is potable, but it may have a strong chlorine
taste. Many ships also leave bottled water in the cabins, but just
because it’s there doesn’t mean it’s free. Ditto for items in the mini-
bar, unless you’re sailing on a really swanky vessel. A card some-
where nearby should indicate the prices.
 Directions near the phone tell you how to make calls to other pas-
sengers and ship personnel, as well as how to dial home from the
ship (though there are cheaper options — see Chapter 5).
 You should find a little binder detailing ship services, including
room service. There should also be a Do Not Disturb sign, forms
and bags for the ship’s laundry and dry cleaning services (offered
on all but the smallest ships), and probably a deck plan showing
what’s where on your vessel.
 Most ships have personal safes somewhere in the cabin. They’re
not big, but they’re more than adequate for storing your passports,
plane tickets, jewelry, and other valuables. If your ship doesn’t
have personal safes, you can check valuables at the purser’s desk.
Chapter 6: Embarkation Day 81

Exploring the Ship
We suggest you spend some of your time on the first day exploring the
ship. Carry your shipboard charge card (in case you want to buy a drink),
your cabin key, and a deck plan. If there’s no deck plan in your cabin, ask
at the reception desk. Some ships — especially the really big ones —
offer guided tours on embarkation day, but what’s the fun in that? We
much prefer just wandering around and scoping out cozy nooks and
comfortable barstools, and maybe grabbing a bite at the welcome-
aboard buffet.
Getting a jump on your fellow passengers
You may have been able to pre-book shore excursions, spa times, and
reservations at the ship’s alternative restaurant before your cruise (see
Chapter 4 for more about this), but if not, now’s the time to do so that
you don’t get shut out of the best spots. This is especially important if
you’ve got your eye on a specialized shore excursion that’s limited to a
certain number of guests, or if you want a prime time slot such as an
appointment with the hair stylist right before dinner on formal nights, 
or a massage appointment at midafternoon on a day at sea.
You don’t have to sign up for anything early if you don’t want to. You can
generally sign up for shore excursions until the day (or sometimes 36
hours) before they’re scheduled, and sometimes you can get a last-
minute appointment at the spa.
If your ship has a library of videos or DVDs for watching in your cabin,
you may also want to drop by there early to get the best selection.
Sailing away
You may want to be on the deck, drink in hand, when the ship leaves the
pier. The nostalgic appeal alone makes it worthwhile (“Arrivederci! Don’t
forget to write!”), but some ships offer complimentary champagne to
sweeten the deal.
Attending the Safety Drill
Ships are required by law to hold a safety drill within 24 hours of depar-
ture, and most lines get it out of the way either right before or right after
sailing out of port. Attendance is mandatory, and stewards often check
your cabin to make sure you’re not hiding out.
In your cabin, you should find a bright-orange life jacket for each passen-
ger, including special ones for any kids in your cabin (if they’re not there,
let your cabin steward know immediately). Features on the jackets include
a whistle and a light that turns on automatically when it hits water.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
82

The ship’s daily program lists the time of your drill, and the captain also
makes several announcements over the ship’s PA as drill time gets close.
When you hear the signal (seven short blasts on the ship’s alarm whis-
tle, followed by one long blast), collect your life jacket and follow the
signs to your designated muster station, whose number is written both
on the back of your cabin door and on your life jacket. You go to this
place in case of a real emergency, too. Ship staff is posted in corridors
and stairways to direct you.
Although some drills are very brief, others can go on for a half-hour or
more. Sorry, no drinks allowed, but we’ve had fun during long drills by
taking pictures of each other in our puffy orange vests.
Gearing Up for the Days Ahead
In general, life on a big ship can follow a kind of bipolar logic: On the one
hand, you’re taking a trip to visit some places you haven’t seen before;
on the other, you may get into such a cruise zone that you don’t want to
leave the ship, shuttling from pool to lounge to buffet to spa to virtual-
golf simulator to basketball court to lecture to sports bar. Try for the
middle path. It works for Buddhism, so it should work for you.
The following two sections detail what you can expect when the ship is
in port and at sea.
One if by land: Days ashore
Map out your days in port to make sure you see all that the destination
offers. Decide ahead of time whether you want to take an excursion or
go off on your own; whether there are cultural attractions, natural won-
ders, or shopping zones that pique your interest; and whether you want
to lunch locally or on the ship. (Check out the chapters in Part V for
specifics on the ports of call.) To make sure that you don’t miss the 
boat — literally — take careful note of your ship’s departure time.
At some ports, your ship docks in or near the center of town. At others,
you dock in a far-off passenger or commercial port and have to take a
taxi or bus to town. At still other ports, there’s no dock at all, so your
ship anchors offshore and shuttles passengers back and forth via a
small boat called a tender. To catch a lift on a tender, you usually go to a
lounge area and take a number. Although you get a lower number and
get ashore earlier if you get to the lounge earlier, the lines tend to be
longer first thing in the morning, so sometimes you’re better off linger-
ing over a second cup of coffee than rushing to the lounge to wait in line.
If you signed up in advance for a shore excursion, you’re assigned a time
and place to meet, and get priority group debarkation.
Don’t feel like you have to get off at every port of call, but you may want
to at least stretch your legs and get some exercise. On big ships espe-
cially, some people stay on the ship, which takes on a haunting yet
Chapter 6: Embarkation Day 83

appealing aura when the crowds disappear. The pool may be closed, but
you can still sit on the Sun Deck, take spa treatments, use the gym, play
cards, and enjoy some quiet time. On port days, the ship offers fewer
organized activities, but you can still find offerings such as movies, live
music poolside, a few seminars, and maybe a sports competition or two.
Two if by sea: Days at sea
If you sail on a big ship, brace yourself for a staggering array of sea-day
activities, especially in the Caribbean and Mexican Riviera, where typical
offerings include exercise classes, lectures, movies, pool games, dance

An onboard who’s who
So, just who are all those people walking around in the spiffy uniforms anyway?
 Captain: The big boss (may also be referred to as The Master); he’s in charge.
 Staff captain: Second in command; normally in charge of navigation and safety.
 Hotel manager: In charge of passenger services, including restaurants, bars, and
accommodations. If you need someone to complain to in these areas, the buck
stops here.
 Chief engineer: In charge of all the onboard machinery, including the engines.
 Purser: In charge of information and financial matters. This person delivers your
bill at the end of the cruise.
 Chief steward: In charge of making sure all cabins and public rooms are cleaned
and maintained.
 Cabin stewards: The people who clean the cabins.
 Head chef or chef de cuisine: In charge of the kitchen (galley) and the menus.
 Maitre d’: In charge of the dining room operation.
 Dining stewards: A fancy name for waiters.
 Assistant waiters: Used to be known as busboys.
 Sommeliers: Wine experts who take your wine order and take you through the
sniffing, sipping, nodding ritual; handled by the dining steward on many ships.
 Cruise director: In charge of all activities and entertainment; also acts as the ship’s
emcee.
 Shore excursion director: In charge of land tours; also often the port lecturer.
 Entertainment director: Heads the show team.
 Doctor: In charge of medical care.

classes, and contests that range from golf putting to hairy backs and
knobby knees (the hairiest and knobbiest win).
Sea days on Alaskan cruises are more destination-oriented, with the
ships visiting glaciers and areas known for exemplary whale-watching.
Wildlife and glacier experts are often on board to explain more about the
area’s natural wonders. Other activities may be closed or at least pared
down when the ship is scheduled to cruise in and around the more
extravagant natural wonders, such as Glacier Bay, Tracy Arm Fjord, or
Hubbard Glacier.
Sea days in other cruise regions are similar to the above. As a general
rule, small ships rarely spend entire days at sea unless they’re exploring
natural areas (such as Glacier Bay).

In This Chapter
 Finding food, nearly all the time
 Checking out traditional dining
 Considering alternative dinner options
 Doing breakfast and lunch
F
ood — mountains and mountains of it, all you can eat and then some,
on buffet plates as big as serving platters — is the number-one joke
among comedians working the cruise circuit, because, like all the best
(and worst) comedy, it’s true. A cruise ship is a veritable feeding frenzy;
only your willpower stands between you and a brand new waistline. To
please all palates and appetites, cruise lines make food available 24 hours
a day, and on the largest megaships you can expect eight to ten different
restaurants and cafes, from traditional dining rooms to casual buffet
restaurants, specialty outlets ranging from sushi bars to steakhouses,
diner-style burger joints, romantic French restaurants, and casual Tex-Mex
bars, plus nooks for pizza, burgers, and ice cream, and 24-hour room serv-
ice to fill up what few gaps there might be in the whole smorgasbord.
Though overeating is pretty difficult to avoid, you don’t have to gain an
extra five pounds on a weeklong cruise. Ships offer healthier options for
noshing, such as fruit and fish, plus most ships have great well-stocked
gyms and fitness classes. Better yet, you can vow to take the stairs and
not the elevator. On today’s huge ships, that’s quite an opportunity to
burn calories. In port, sign up for active stuff such as biking and kayak-
ing. Do we see a Jenny Craig endorsement in your future?
Never a Food-Free Moment
The key word for cruise ship eating is “endless.” Check out this typical
meal schedule (and approximate times) to understand what they mean
by the old joke, “You come on as a passenger and you leave as cargo”:
 Early risers’ breakfast (6:30 a.m.): Coffee and simple pastries
 Buffet breakfast (7:30–11 a.m.): Daily specials, sweet rolls, fruit,
eggs, bacon, French toast, cereal, oatmeal, omletes, yogurt, crois-
sants, coffee, juice, and tea

 Breakfast in the dining room (Main seating begins around 7 a.m.;
late seating around 8 or 9 a.m.): Full breakfast, including omelets,
eggs, French toast, pancakes, breakfast meats, potatoes, fish,
cereal, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, and juices
 Pizza (11 a.m.–11 p.m.): Fresh pies all day; some outlets also have
salads
 Buffet lunch (11:30 a.m.–3 p.m.): Full hot and cold lunch offerings,
including salad bar, pasta station, and grill for burgers
 Lunch in the dining room (Main seating at noon; late seating at
1:30 p.m.): Full luncheon with a rotating menu of hot dishes, salads,
sandwiches, pastas, grilled items, and desserts
 Afternoon tea (3:30–5 p.m.): Tea and cake or cookies
 Snack time (all afternoon): Ice cream and fat-free frozen yogurt
 Buffet dinner (5:30–11 p.m): Casual setting and hot and cold
entrees, sometimes focused on a theme cuisine like Asian or Italian;
carved beef, ham, or turkey, desserts, salads, cold meats, breads,
cheeses, and fruit
 Dinner in the dining room (Early seating around 6 p.m.; late seat-
ing around 8:15 p.m.): Gourmet cuisine, including popular interna-
tional and American dishes served in seven courses with desserts
 Midnight buffet: Extravagant offerings of hot and cold entrees,
desserts, salads, cold meats, breads, cheeses, and fruit, sometimes
arranged around a theme, sometimes offered in a party atmosphere
on the pool deck
Still hungry? Start walking: Within a few hundred yards you’ll probably
find a coffee bar selling cappuccino and other specialty drinks (and
snacks), or maybe a gourmet ice cream parlor, or a 24-hour diner, or . . .
The Take on Traditional Dining
Some people like formality, some like to keep things casual. For the
former, the traditional setup — where guests reserve an early or late
seating in one of the main dining rooms and dine with the same group
throughout the cruise — is still offered on most ships. Tables seat four,
six, eight, or more people.
Ships offer a very limited number of tables for two. If you want one
badly, be sure to make your request early.
Dining at a table with eight seats gives you enough variety among your
companions that you shouldn’t get bored. And don’t feel that the chair
you sit in the first night needs to be your place every night. Playing
musical chairs through the week will give you new perspective, conver-
sationally speaking.
Chapter 7: Wining and Dining 87

Don’t panic if you end up sitting next to some obnoxious type who
chews with his mouth open and keeps shouting “What’s with all these
forks?” Try to change your table by speaking with (and maybe greasing
the palm of) the maitre d’. You can also request a larger or smaller table
by visiting the maitre d’s station on the first day of the cruise.
Dining course by course
With five or more courses being about average at a traditional cruise
ship meal, you can expect to be at table for at least an hour and a half.
Enjoy! It’s a social experience. Here’s what you’re likely to find:
 Overall, bet on continental/international cuisine in the dining 
room — think steaks, chicken, fish, and pasta, plus occasional 
Asian or Mexican dishes to spice things up.
 The courses consist of an appetizer, soup, salad, main course (with
starch and vegetables), and dessert, and on some ships pasta, fruit,
and cheese courses as well.
 Most lines provide at least one healthy selection in each category,
sometimes even listing the fat, salt content, and number of calories
on the menu. Some lines also offer low-carb items.
 Most ships feature daily vegetarian selections.
 Children’s menus are common.
 On some nights, the ship builds the menus around a theme, such as
Caribbean or Italian.
Feel free to make a culinary request if you have an urge for something 
in particular, but remember that the chef can prepare dishes only with
what’s available in the larder. Make your requests the day before so that
the chef can prepare.
Considering what to wear
Most 7-night cruises include two formal nights, where the dress code
suggests men wear suits or tuxes, and for the ladies, fancy dresses or
pant suits. Of course, one person’s formalwear may be wildly different
from another’s. A good rule of thumb is to wear what you’d wear to a
wedding.
To skip the dressy duds, hit the more casual dining venues on formal
nights (see the next section), where you can get away with much more
casual garb, such as chinos and polo shirts. In general, lines discourage
jeans and shorts at dinner shipwide, but we’ve seen that, too.
A Sea of Other Dining Options
If traditional dining sounds too regimented for you, no problem: Most
ships have supplemented the traditional setup with other more flexible
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
88

options. You can find at least one, if not many, casual venues operating
nightly without fixed seating times. Norwegian Cruise Line, for example,
operates all of its restaurants like this — you decide where, when, and
with whom you want to dine. On Princess ships, you have the choice to
either dine the traditional way or with open seating, but you must pick
one option when you book your cruise.
Just about every large cruise ship also gives you the option of dining in a
more intimate restaurant, with a higher level of service (usually the ship’s
best waiters are sent to these spots), more expertly prepared food, and
plenty of tables for two. The lines usually decorate them in upscale décor
and focus on one type of cuisine — Italian, Asian, French, and steakhouses
are the most popular. You typically have to pay a fee of between $10 and
$30 per head and reserve your table in advance. Be sure to do so early on
in the cruise to ensure you get the evening you want.
Many ships also offer a free casual alternative dinner option — an open-
seating, no-reservations-required, casual dress affair, most often in the
main buffet restaurant. Sometimes the buffet spread is supplemented
with a short menu of simple food such as steaks, grilled fish, pasta, and
salads. And sometimes the ship will redecorate the buffet to make it a
little snazzier, with waiters sometimes on hand to carry your tray or
bring drinks. Generally, this option is available until late in the evening,
sometimes past midnight.
Of course, the ultracasual alternative is room service. The menu may be
limited (though some ships allow you to order off the dining room menu
and have it delivered to your cabin), but you don’t have to put on your
formal duds — or any duds at all.
Making special dietary requests
If you have any special dietary needs, make arrangements with the ship
when you book your cruise. After you board, check with the maitre d’
your first day out to make sure that the kitchen got your request. Some
lines offer kosher menus and most have vegetarian, low-fat, low-salt, or
sugar-free options.
Satisfying your beverage preferences
If you’re a soda junkie, many lines have a deal where you can buy a pre-
paid drink pass, instead of doling out the usual $1.50 to $2 a pop. Often
you’re issued a special drink card or given a special cup that you use for
unlimited refills of fountain soda. Typically, the price is $35 to $45 for an
adult soda card for a weeklong cruise. Prices are lower for children.
Unsure about how to select wine? Consult the wine steward (if your 
ship has one) or find out whether the ship offers a wine-tasting seminar
during the cruise. A small fee is typically involved for the seminar (prob-
ably $5 or $10), but you get to sample several varieties, and if you find
something you like, you can order on the spot and a waiter will bring
your wine to your table at dinnertime.
Chapter 7: Wining and Dining 89

Digging into Breakfast and Lunch
Breakfast and lunch in the dining room are multicourse events that are
half sustenance and half experience. Menus generally change daily. If
you’re in a hurry or just don’t want to deal with the formalities, you can
take advantage of the casual buffet, often located adjacent to the main
pool area.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience

Cruise lines with the best taste
If you’re a foodie, you’ll want to go with one of the following lines, which all have a
history of offering excellent cuisine:
 Crystal: The best Asian food afloat, and ultratasty cuisine all around. A guest chef
series brings celebrity chefs aboard.
 Regent Seven Seas: Combining traditional and new cuisine, Regent menus are
among the best in the business. The Seven Seas Mariner and Seven Seas
Voyager also have specialty restaurants overseen by chefs from the prestigious
French cooking school Le Cordon Bleu. On some sailings, these chefs offer cook-
ing classes.
 Seabourn: Celebrity chef Charlie Palmer consults on cuisine that reflects California
and Pacific Rim influences but also includes favorites such as broiled lobster and
beef Wellington.
 SeaDream: This line does just about everything right, with the chefs using fresh
ingredients in creative ways. And no special request gets denied, as long as the
ingredients are available.
 Silversea: French-influenced recipes and great steaks cooked to order, as well
as themed buffets, guest chefs, and a specialty restaurant by Spain’s renowned
chef Joachim Koeper. Service is first rate.
Although not quite as extravagant, these lines are also worth a mention:
 Celebrity: Consulting chef Michel Roux creates a meal that lasts a luxurious three
hours and thrills the palate for the reservations-only alternative restaurants on
the Millennium, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation.
 Cunard: On the Queen Mary 2, Cunard assigns you to a restaurant based on your
cabin category, and if you’re in the Queen’s or Princess Grill, expect the best.
Celebrity chef Todd English also has his first shipboard restaurant on this vessel.
 Oceania: Excellent alternative dining at a steakhouse and Italian restaurant, each
with beautiful décor and huge portions.
 Windstar: Top Los Angeles restaurateur Joachim Splichal consults on fresh and
creative menus that go way beyond what you may expect from a sailing ship.

For lunch, you may also have an on-deck grill option with hot dogs, 
burgers, and chicken, and the newest ships offer even more: On Royal
Caribbean’s giant Voyager- and Freedom-class ships, for example, a
Johnny Rockets diner caters to cruisers who crave a good burger and
shake. The Disney ships have a poolside snack bar serving chicken fin-
gers, fries, and other tasty fast-food treats.
Chapter 7: Wining and Dining 91
Mastering dining room etiquette
A few onboard etiquette tips, from us to you . . .
Do’s
 Arrive in the dining room on time. Dining hours are listed in the daily program.
 Display your understanding of what the members of the dining staff do. Order
from the waiter, not the bus boy.
 Offer wine to the others at your table. If your tablemates are as polite as you are,
one of them will order the next night’s bottle.
 If you don’t finish your bottle of wine, ask your waiter to have it corked. You can
have it held for the next night.
 Consider the waiter’s suggestion about menu items or specials. The waiter can
tell you what he or she recommends that day.
Don’ts
 Don’t start eating until the waiter serves everyone at your table. This is good eti-
quette no matter where you dine.
 Don’t show up dressed inappropriately for the evening. Check the daily bulletin
for the evening’s dress code and prepare accordingly.
 Don’t use the wrong silverware. Use your silverware moving from the outside in.
The first fork on the left is the one that you use for the first course.
 Don’t feel as if you have to eat a meal you don’t like. Feel free to send food back
and ask for something else if you don’t like your selection.
 Don’t smoke. Just about all ships have completely nonsmoking dining rooms.

Yaaaaawn! Is it morning already? You open your eyes. Yep, there’s
light coming in around those drawn shades. No alarm clock, of
course. You’re on vacation, why would you set one? And if it’s a day at
sea, you don’t have anywhere to be if you don’t want to. You shuffle
across the room, throw open the shades. Hey! There’s an ocean out
there? Your head hurts a little from all that champagne last night, but
that’s nothing some scrambled eggs and a few minutes in the sauna
won’t cure. Now let’s see, what to do after that? Go swimming? Take a
class? Watch a movie? Where’s that daily planner? Let’s see what there is
to do . . .
Digging into the Daily Bulletin
On all but the smallest ships, a daily bulletin is typically delivered to
your cabin each evening, advising you of everything that’s going on the
next day, and other info pertinent to onboard life such as the following:
 The day’s activities and live entertainment
 Hours of operation for the bars and shops (with sales and specials
noted)

 The evening dress code, if there is one
 Listings of in-cabin TV programs and movie presentations
 A schedule of exercise classes and fitness/wellness lectures
 Details about upcoming ports of call (such as shopping hot spots
and top attractions)
 Facts about the region you’re sailing through
 All-aboard time, if the ship is spending a day in port
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, and, like your local newspaper at home, lots
of annoying “advertising” supplements may be stuffed in with the bul-
letin, promoting special deals at the ship’s shops, spa promotions, and
other ways to part you from your cash.
Depending on the line you sail with, your bulletin may offer up to 50
activities every day, designed so that everybody on board can find
something that suits their tastes. Other ships offer almost no activities,
catering instead to an audience that likes to do things at their own pace.
Doing Absolutely Nothing at All
On days at sea especially, you’re faced with something most folks don’t
often get in their day-to-day lives: a full day to do anything you want, at
any time you want. You may respond by going into zombie hammock
opium-den mode, so blissed-out from the sun, the lack of responsibility,
and the motherly rocking of the ship that you can’t even rise out of your
deck chair. And why should you? We’ve gotten in this mode more times
than we can remember, and recommend it highly.
Lounging at the pool
The Pool Deck is the center of daytime activity on most warm-weather
itineraries: a spinning vortex of goofy poolside games, live music, hot
tubs, and eternal piña coladas. Most modern megaships have enough
deck chairs to go around, but claim a spot early if you want to be at
pool-central all day. Be fair, though: Don’t just put your towel and book
on a chair then walk away for hours. That’s really irritating; other folks
deserve a chance, too.
Surprisingly, you may not actually swim much at all while on board —
most ship pools are just too small. The pool, then, is more of a place for
taking a quick cooling dip or a long, leisurely soak while you check out
the other passengers in their swimsuits.
If you’re more into the idea of relaxing in the sun and reading a book, the
Pool Deck probably isn’t for you. Generally the music, or the giant talk-
ing video screen more and more ships are installing on the main pool
deck, is too darn loud to think straight, much less read a book. For that,
Chapter 8: Onboard Activities and Entertainment 93

you can usually find an abundance of chairs on the uppermost deck and
sometimes the Promenade or Boat Deck, or in hidden little nooks in the
stern that get little foot traffic. Many ships offer more than one pool, so
you may be able to retreat to a quieter one sans loud music and squeal-
ing kids, which is often the pool tucked back at the stern or near the spa.
Sleuthing out the cinema
Most of the larger cruise ships either have dedicated movie theaters or
(more commonly) show recent-release films in the main theater. Disney
Cruise Line, whose ships offer marvelous movie theaters with stadium
seating, big screens, comfy chairs, and first-run films (from Disney-owned
studios, of course), is the unquestioned leader here. Some Holland
America ships have dedicated movie theaters, too, with free popcorn.
Hiding out in your cabin
If you prefer a really quiet day or you spent too much time in the sun the
first day, there’s nothing saying you have to leave your cabin at all. Room
service can bring you enough food and drink to feed a small country, and
all but the smallest ships show recent-release films and sometimes clas-
sics on their cabin TVs, as well as TV shows from A&E, the Discovery
Channel, ESPN, HBO, History & Biography, and TNT. Some ships have
programming available in several languages, to suit a diverse clientele.
Some of the newer ships (including those in the Royal Caribbean and
Celebrity fleets) also offer pay-per-view options, ranging from G to X rat-
ings. Other ships have installed DVD players in their cabins, with movies
available for checkout from the ship’s library.
Another viewing option is, well, you. Lots of ships videotape activities 
to make sure that no one misses anything, and replay them on the TV
system (and of course, sell copies to take home for anyone interested).
You may be able to watch yourself doing the limbo at a poolside party
from your own room — which may make for good or bad viewing,
depending on the kind of night you had. Holland America videotapes
cooking demonstrations at its onboard Culinary Arts Centers and beams
them into cabin TVs afterward.
Many ships also have Internet access in cabins, so you can plug in your
laptop and surf the net or catch up on work. (Though we sure hope you
didn’t bring any work with you — you’re on vacation for Pete’s sake.)
Learning as You Lounge
Most ships, whether mainstream megaships, ultraluxury vessels, or small
adventure-oriented craft, offer at least some lectures, demonstrations,
and seminars, sometimes on general subjects and sometimes on subjects
matched to your sailing region. Topics may include the following:
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
94

 History and culture: The history of transatlantic cruising on a
transatlantic cruise, for example, or a lecture on Alaskan Native 
culture while sailing the Inside Passage.
 Natural history and marine biology: Maybe rain forest ecology
while sailing Central America, a lecture on volcanoes while sailing
in Hawaii, or a lesson in whale behavior in Alaska.
 Computer applications: Sometimes practical ones such as word
processing or spreadsheet software; sometimes more creative ones
such as photo-imaging or Web design software.
 Health and nutrition: Including weight-loss and diet seminars.
 Lifestyle topics: Including personal investing, handwriting analysis,
or scrapbook creation.
 The arts: Digital photography workshops are big these days, join-
ing old favorites such as flower arranging. Princess Cruises also
offers ceramics workshops on some of its ships.
 The “classics”: Classes in napkin-folding, vegetable-carving, scarf-
tying, and mixology have been offered aboard cruise ships since
Eisenhower was president.
Think of these classes more as fun and informative diversions than as
something you can add to your resume. On the other hand, they can
sometimes provide a good first insight into something you can pursue
further after you get home.
In addition to these kinds of lectures, many cruise lines also offer regular
guided explorations in several other fields:
 As part of their guest lecturer programs, cruise lines often invite
famous or simply notable speakers aboard to speak on their sub-
ject of expertise. For example, Silversea lined up former CBS
Evening News anchor Walter Cronkite aboard part of its world
cruise in early 2007, speaking about his amazing career. Other
speakers are less well known. Princess, for instance, used to regu-
larly host a former Scotland Yard detective who had decades of sto-
ries from the underworld, and knew how to tell them.
 Dance classes are usually available, most frequently in salsa, coun-
try, and ballroom styles. Most are taught by the ship’s onboard
entertainers.
 Cooking demonstrations are all the rage with cruise lines, often
presented like you see them on TV, complete with model kitchen
and video monitors for an up-close view of the preparations.
Holland America is particularly big on these, with special theaters
installed for this purpose aboard nearly all of their ships.
 Similarly, many lines offer wine-tasting seminars, conducted by the
ship’s sommeliers or sometimes by guest experts. Royal Caribbean’s
Chapter 8: Onboard Activities and Entertainment 95

Navigator of the Seas and Mariner of the Seas both have wine bars
created in association with Mondavi and several other California
vineyards. Classes in wine appreciation are held there throughout
the week, and passengers can stage their own tastings by ordering
special “wine flight” tasting menus.
 On most megaships and many luxury ships, staff from the gym, spa,
and beauty salon offer seminars on health, beauty, and fitness,
with topics including skin and hair care, detox for weight loss, and
wrinkle reductions. These seminars are free, but their ulterior
motive is convincing you to sign up for expensive treatments or
personal-training sessions. Go anyway if you’re interested; you can
just say no to the rest.
 In general, the ultraluxury lines have the most refined and interest-
ing enrichment programs. Crystal, for example, offers classes
developed with the Society of Wine Educators, Berlitz, Pepperdine
University, Sotheby’s, and other notable institutions, all of which
provide lecturers on topics such as food and wine, arts and enter-
tainment, business and technology, lifestyle (including interior
design, book clubs, and language instruction), and wellness. The
wine and food seminars include cocktail making, wine appreciation,
chocolate, spa cuisine, and — one close to our hearts — beer
essentials.
 Aboard Cunard’s Queen Mary 2, transatlantic crossings offer a simi-
lar program developed in association with Oxford University, fea-
turing talks on history, global politics, cultural trends, theater,
science, music, literature, and more.
 The small, adventure-oriented ships frequently offer a daily round
of informal lectures by their onboard naturalists and historians,
sometimes once a day (usually after dinner), sometimes several
times a day.
 And, sometimes, you can find lectures that come out of left field.
Aboard Royal Caribbean’s Voyager-class vessels, for instance, 
resident Krooze Komics offer lectures on clown history and tech-
niques, and teach classes in juggling. How fun is that?
Most lectures and some classes are free, though others (such as wine
tastings and many computer classes) may carry a small fee.
Feeling the Burn
Yo, muscle heads, don’t worry, cruise ships aren’t going to let you down.
Back in the day (think Titanic), ship gyms were stuck down somewhere
between the kitchen and the bilge, and looked like, well, gyms — the
kind they had back then: dark, sweaty, with weights and prehistoric
rowing machines and those things with the big strap that you put
around your waist and just sorta jiggled around.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
96

All that’s changed over the past decade or so. Beginning in the early to
mid-1990s, the gyms on new ships migrated from below sea level to pre-
mium spots way up on the top decks, with all the newest equipment,
trendy fitness classes, and wraparound windows to provide a view. 
Spas also became big business, as cruise lines capitalized on wellness
trends, and several lines also began building larger onboard sports
areas, from miniature golf to virtual golf to basketball and even ice-
skating and surfing.
Pumping iron
Gyms on the megaships typically have a dozen or more treadmills and
just as many step machines, stationary bikes, and elliptical trainers, plus
aerobics rooms, saunas, full circuits of weight machines, racks of dumb-
bells, and the usual gym amenities: locker rooms, piles of towels, and
cold, cold water.
The best gym facilities are on Carnival’s Conquest-, Spirit-, and Destiny-
class ships; Princess’s Grand- and Coral-class ships; NCL’s Dawn, Spirit,
Star, Jewel, Sun, and Pride of Aloha; Royal Caribbean’s Freedom-, Voyager-
and Radiance-class ships; and just about all of Holland America’s ships.
Working out on your own is always free, as are most basic aerobics and
stretching classes. Trendier classes — such as spinning, Pilates, yoga,
boxing, tai chi, or self-defense — usually cost about $10 or $12 a class,
with some ships offering unlimited weeklong passes (for around $70), 
as well as personal training sessions (also around $75 or $85).
Almost every ship offers some kind of jogging track, either a dedicated
one with a track-type surface or simply a continuous loop of regular
decking.
As a general rule, the smaller the ship, the smaller the gym, though there
are exceptions. Windstar’s 308-passenger Wind Surf has a surprisingly
large gym and spa facilities, while the gyms on Princess’s otherwise glo-
rious Diamond and Sapphire Princess are too small considering the
ships’ 2,670-passenger size. The really small adventure-oriented ships
rarely have gyms at all, but they compensate with off-ship options such
as kayaking and hiking.
Getting a game going
If sports are your thing (either the team or the individual variety), plan
to book aboard one of the really big ships. Royal Caribbean’s enormous
Freedom- and Voyager-class ships have everything from a full-size bas-
ketball court to an outdoor rock-climbing wall, an in-line skating track, a
running track, an ice-skating rink, miniature golf, and a virtual golf simu-
lator (see more about golf in the “Hitting the links” section later in this
chapter). The new Freedom also has a high-tech surfing simulator with
real waves, a sprawling water park and a full-sized Everlast boxing ring.
Royal Caribbean’s rock-climbing walls proved so popular they’re now a
Chapter 8: Onboard Activities and Entertainment 97

bona fide RCI icon, and were added to the entire fleet. Other Royal
Caribbean ships have cool sports options of their own. During her 
2005 refurbishment, Enchantment of the Seas was outfitted with bungee
trampolines.
Hitting the water
The small luxury ships are best for people who want to hit the water
right from the vessel. All the Windstar, Seabourn, and SeaDream ships
and Star Clippers’ Royal Clipper have retractable watersports platforms
that can be lowered from the stern when the ship is at anchor in calm
waters, letting passengers windsurf, kayak, sail, water-ski, go on banana-
boat rides, and sometimes swim and snorkel right from the ship.
SeaDream’s 110-passenger yachts even carry jet skis.
Hitting the links
Over the past few years, a lot of cruise lines have ramped up their golf
offerings, adding hundreds of golf shore excursions as well as onboard
instruction, virtual golf, pro shops, and other amenities.
Almost all the major cruise lines offer some of these, but Carnival (www.
carnivalgolf.com), Holland America (www.hollandamericagolf.
com), Celebrity (www.celebritycruisesgolf.com), Seabourn (www.
seabourngolf.com), Princess (www.princessgolf.com), and Silversea
(www.silverseagolf.com) go the extra mile, featuring programs cre-
ated by Florida’s Elite Golf Cruises (www.elitegolfcruises.com) that
offer instruction, guided golf excursions in almost every port of call,
computer simulators that mimic play on some of the world’s great
courses, professional onboard club fitting (with options to rent or buy),
and other pro shop–style extras.
On its new Hawaii-based ships, Norwegian Cruise Line has created a
major golf program that offers excursion packages at several courses
each day, bookable either singly or as a package deal. Golf shoes and a
variety of Callaway clubs are available for rent on board, and golf equip-
ment and accessories are for sale in the onboard pro shop.
SeaDream Yacht Club’s 110-passenger vessels are also equipped with
golf simulators. Royal Caribbean offers golf simulators and miniature
golf on their Freedom-, Voyager- and Radiance-class ships, plus
Splendour and Legend of the Seas.
Sitting down for sports
All this talk about sports got you tired? Or, alternately, are you just more
of an indoor sports kinda person?
Pub-sport enthusiasts can get their kicks on a number of ships. All NCL
ships have dartboards in their pubs, while Royal Caribbean’s Radiance-
class ships have gyro-balanced pool tables. Practically every ship has a
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
98

card room where you can expect bridge to be the most popular game.
Some ships carry a bridge instructor on board and offer tournaments.
The card rooms often provide decks of cards. According to one of our
spies, there’s a brisk pick-up trade in Texas Hold ’Em poker in the card
rooms on NCL’s Hawaii-based ships, which lack a casino due to Hawaiian
gambling restrictions. Shhhh. Mum’s the word.
Most megaships and some mid-size ships have sports bars with large-
screen TVs broadcasting ESPN and whatever live games are available
that day. Carnival’s recently launched Carnival Liberty, the Disney Magic,
and Princess’s Golden, Star, and Caribbean Princess all have giant 300-
square-foot (or so) digital TV/movie screens mounted out on their Pool
Decks, where they broadcast the big games as well as movies and other
programming. Waiters bring drinks and popcorn.
Getting rubbed up at the spa
Trivia question: What’s more sybaritic than lying in your underwear in a
warm, dark room while a good-looking young man or woman rubs oil
over your whole body?
Answer: Nothing. Nothing that’s legal, anyway.
Cruise ship spas went from simple massage rooms in the early ’90s to pro-
gressively more amazing New Age paradises as the years went on. Today
the best are perched on top decks, boast great views from eight or ten or
more treatment rooms, are decorated in soothing Asian and North African
motifs, and offer a menu of massages (including regular massage and the
popular hot-stone massage), facials, aqua-therapies, mud packs, and other
esoteric procedures that make you drool, plus beauty treatments such as
teeth whitening and the more standard manicure/pedicure.
Call it a monopoly if you will, but most cruise ship spas on most of the
cruise lines are run by one company: London-based Steiner Leisure.
There aren’t many exceptions. NCL, Oceania, and Silversea’s spas are
operated by a company called Mandara, but (what a surprise . . .)
they’re owned by Steiner, too. Companies bucking the Steiner monopoly
include Cunard (whose QM2 spa is run by Canyon Ranch) and Regent
Seven Seas (whose spas are run by Carita), plus Star Clipper’s sailing
ship Royal Clipper, whose spa is run in-house.
In general, you won’t find too many bargains at onboard spas, whose
rates tend to be high (though look for bargains on port days, when most
passengers are off the ship and the spa’s empty). As for the quality of
the treatments, they vary depending on the talent of the person adminis-
tering them. We’ve had some amazing massages on board, as well as
some blissfully esoteric treatments: Matt’s round of aqua-therapy
aboard Celebrity back in the late ’90s still makes him tingle. On the other
hand, that Ionithermie treatment, which supposedly makes you lose
inches as it’s happening, didn’t do much for us except provide a lot of
laughs afterward.
Chapter 8: Onboard Activities and Entertainment 99

Here’s a sampling of treatments and their standard Steiner rates:
 25-minute Swedish massage: $60 to $72
 50-minute full-body massage: $89 to $128
 75-minute hot stone massage: $142 to $190
 50-minute facial: $89 to $109
 Manicure: $25 to $45
 Pedicure: $40 to $65
Frequently, passengers — especially women passengers — are subjected
to a sales pitch at the end of their treatment, suggesting various creams,
exfoliants, toners, moisturizers, and masks that help you look like Christy
Turlington when you get home. Buy if you want, but feel free to say nope,
no way, not interested. You’re in charge.
Rates for identical treatments can vary by as much as $20 from ship to
ship. Payment is charged to your onboard account, and may or may not
include a tip for the therapist. Ask to make sure before you add one.
Make your spa appointments early, especially if you’re sailing on a mega-
ship. If you don’t head to the spa to sign up early, you risk being relegated
to a bad time slot — either very early in the morning, very late in the
evening, or (worst of all) during a port day when it would conflict with
your shore plans. On some ships, you can call from your stateroom tele-
phone to make an appointment. A few ships — Princess’s Caribbean
Princess and Sapphire Princess and Silversea’s Silver Cloud, Wind, Shadow,
and Whisper — have systems that let guests prebook their spa treatments
before they sail. Ditto for Cunard’s Queen Mary 2, though it’s only open to
guests in the top-class suites and previous Canyon Ranch customers. It’s
good to be king. Reportedly, Steiner Leisure is working on a prebooking
system that it will eventually use aboard all the ships on which it runs
spas, though it’s still in development.
Entertaining Yourself after Dark
Evenings are when cruise ships begin to take on the romantic aura of the
old ocean liners, as passengers dress up (even if they don’t do the tux-
and-gown thing as much as they used to), step out, and join the cham-
pagne slipstream. After dinner you can take in a show, listen to some
music, maybe hit the dance floor, or head for the casino. The main-
stream lines’ megaships have a multitude of options; small luxe ships,
such as those of Seabourn, SeaDream, and Silversea, have fewer, but that
goes along with their quieter, more refined vibe. The quality of entertain-
ment, of course, varies from line to line and from ship to ship.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
100

Taking in a show
Big-ship cruising means high-tech shows that feature dazzling laser-
lighting effects, pyrotechnics, video backdrops, actors “flying” in and
out, and large casts of singers and dancers performing everything from
Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber medleys to Elvis tunes
and even, occasionally, something written in the past ten years. Cruise
lines spend millions of dollars on each extravagant production, though
whether you get jazzed by it or not really depends on your taste. If you
don’t dig brassy arrangements, constant motion, nubile young Vegas-
style dancers smiling and lip-synching away, and flashy solo singers
bouncing between high notes, you probably won’t like these either.
Occasionally, of course, something amazing pops up. Disney’s shows, for
example, have characters and stories based on its parent company’s clas-
sic films. Recent shows on NCL are also standouts, with strong soloists
and really original staging, choreography, and choice of material. Carnival
and Royal Caribbean are also reliably strong; the latter’s Freedom- and
Voyager-class ships have a niche show all their own: full-on ice shows in
their skating rinks, with choreography and special effects similar to those
in the main theaters. Royal Caribbean’s sister-line, Celebrity Cruises,
offers shows and other entertainment created by fantasy circus troupe
Cirque du Soleil. Cunard takes a different tack aboard QM2, programming
performances by graduates of Britain’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts,
as well as some more standard song-and-dance revues.
Most ships offer productions twice a night to correspond with traditional
first and second seating dinner times; usually you see the show after
dinner, but, on some nights, you may have the option of checking it out
before. On lines that have deformalized the dining experience (notably
Princess and Norwegian), shows may be scheduled only once a night and
repeated later in the week.
Hitting the vaudeville circuit
On some nights, ships may offer various variety acts instead of (or in
addition to) the big production revues. What to expect? Think magic
shows complete with the old saw-the-assistant-in-half routine; acrobatic
acts and aerialists who fly around on ropes strung from the theater’s
ceiling (always a big hit); jugglers; ventriloquists; and, most commonly
of all, comedians, many of whom work on cruise ships regularly, meeting
the vessels in various ports and then getting off in others to catch up
with their next floating gig. Comedy acts may perform either in the main
theater or in a second performance space, sometimes doing PG- and R-
rated material at an early show and then running the X up the mast at an
adults-only midnight performance. Expect the best humor on the main-
stream ships. Carnival has been known for its comedians for years, and
Norwegian Cruise Line has a partnership with the famed Second City
improv comedy group, who do shows weekly (that are really funny) on
the line’s Norwegian Dawn, sailing out of New York.
Chapter 8: Onboard Activities and Entertainment 101

Ritzier lines, such as Crystal and Cunard, and premium mainstream lines,
such as Holland America and Celebrity, often feature classical pianists or
violinists, though they tend to stick to familiar, ear-catching pieces. Lines
with a European character, such as Costa and MSC, tend to program light-
classical performances as well, typically sticking to pianists or operatic
soloists. The small adventure-oriented ships typically have little or no
formal entertainment on board, though some bring aboard local musi-
cians and/or dancers in various ports — a practice also followed by some
of the mainstream and luxe lines on some itineraries. In Hawaii, for exam-
ple, NCL does a once-a-week show of Polynesian music and dance.
Occasionally, ships carry some well-known singers and other perform-
ers, such as Maureen McGovern, Joel Grey, and Lorna Luft. You may also
see some excellent performers who may not be household names or a
singer who was famous back in the day crooning oldies but goodies. On
a Seabourn cruise, we found Phillip Huber — he created and manipu-
lated the puppets for the hit cult film Being John Malkovich — and his
Huber Marionettes.
Lounging around
As ships have gotten bigger, music venues have multiplied. On the
biggest Royal Caribbean and Carnival ships, you may find eight or nine
choices at night, from background guitar to karaoke, from sing-a-long
piano bars to classical chamber groups. Lounge entertainment varies
not only from ship to ship, but also from room to room on the same
ship, providing enough variety to please most passengers. You’ll likely
find at least one band playing dance tunes, a soloist or duo playing back-
ground music in the atrium, an upbeat electric band playing by the pool,
and often a pianist taking requests at a piano bar. Holland America
always has an afternoon high tea featuring a string trio or quartet, while
Royal Caribbean has a Latin-themed bar on several of their ships, with
Latin-tinged music. Ditto for NCL’s Norwegian Dawn, which has had an
excellent small salsa band aboard every time we’ve sailed.
Channeling your inner diva
If you fantasize about being the next Sinatra, Streisand, J-Lo, or Seinfeld,
your ship has come in: Virtually all large ships have passenger talent
shows, with a sign-up early in the cruise and a final performance in the
main theater or a smaller lounge later in the week. Remember to pack
your sheet music (although the ship’s accompanist may be able to wing
it), and if you want to do a stand-up comedy act, mind your audience: If
you’ve got a G-rated audience, save the X-rated jokes for the hot tub
later on.
On a smaller scale, most large ships offer karaoke several times during
the trip. For the uninitiated, karaoke involves people taking turns singing
to recorded backing tracks of popular songs (from oldies to new pop
hits), as lyrics scroll across a monitor. You choose the song from a book
and the emcee calls you up when it’s your turn. Everyone gets into the
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
102

spirit at these sessions, and no one — regardless of talent level —
should be embarrassed or fear getting the hook.
Carnival recently introduced a new show on some of its vessels that
merges the talent-show and karaoke concepts. Dubbed “Carnival
Legends,” it goes a little something like this: Guests — any guests,
whether they can really sing or not — sign up for the show, pick an alter-
ego (Elvis, James Brown, Madonna, Gloria Estefan, Britney Spears, or
one of several others), then rehearse their number with the ship’s band
and show dancers. Then it’s lights, camera, action, and they’re perform-
ing in full costume in the main lounge, with sets, lighting effects, and a
full audience to complete the picture. The show debuted aboard the
line’s Imagination and has proved so popular that other Carnival ships
will be introducing it soon. Start rehearsing now.
Keeping the Faith
Amid all the activities and entertainment, some ships also manage to
find a place for religious services.
Depending on the ship and the presence of clergy on board, most lines
offer a Sunday nondenominational service, and some lines (including
Costa and Cunard) offer Catholic mass regularly. On Christian and
Jewish holidays, large ships may bring clergy aboard to lead services.
Some ships have chapels, and Cunard’s QE2 has a synagogue as well. For
regular Friday-night Jewish Sabbath services, many ships provide prayer
books, yarmulkes, challah, and wine, but the passengers conduct the
service themselves, with one passenger agreeing to be the leader.

Activities for Children 
and Teens
In This Chapter
 Discovering that cruises can be kid-friendly, too
 Sneaking a peek at babysitting and children’s and teens’ programs
 Informing your kids about cruise ship rules
 Identifying the best cruises for families
W
hile we may have never gotten further than a Holiday Inn at the
beach, kids these days sure do get around. Cruises to the
Caribbean, Alaska, and Europe have become classic must-do family
vacations. Hundreds and hundreds of kids and teens — sometimes more
than a thousand — cruise the decks on a typical big-ship cruise these
days. In fact, about 1 million of the nearly 9 million North Americans
who took a cruise in 2005 were passengers under the age of 17. If you’ve
got kids of your own, this is great news (just ask Heidi, who schlepped
her twin sons on more than a dozen cruises before their fourth birth-
day). If you don’t plan on traveling with kids, well, sure hope you like the
little buggers (otherwise, you may want to consider a small ship instead,
where there tend to be far fewer, or even zippo, tots in tow).
That said, because most kids on a cruise are happy as clams in the chil-
dren’s areas, you won’t see them running around the rest of the ship as
much as you may expect. This is a good thing. Read on for the lowdown
on what ships are offering for families these days.
Kids Are People, Too — And They Cruise
For years now, cruise lines have catered to families, and the amenities
get better with each new ship launched. Playrooms are larger and activi-
ties are more varied, with science and art projects supplementing the
standard pizza parties and scavenger hunts. Cruise lines are smart. They

know that kids cruising today will be the adult cruisers of tomorrow, and
they want to get them hooked early.
Just how many families are cruising with their kids these days? Are you
sitting down? Try 1,000 to 1,200 kids and teens on the biggest ships, espe-
cially during summer vacation and holiday times. A Royal Caribbean
executive told us that as many as 1,500 to 1,800 kids and teens will be
typical on the new jumbo-sized Freedom of the Seas. That adds up to
about one-third or more of the passenger count. Holy moley!
The newer ships of the mass-market lines, including Disney (surprise,
surprise), Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian, and Princess, go all out
with facilities for kids of all ages. Holland America and Celebrity offer
decent facilities, too. All have playrooms; the best are stocked with
goodies such as ball bins and climbing mazes, plus lots of games, toys,
and computers. Teen centers are typical, with many designed to look 
as stylish as adult lounges. Geez, when we were kids, we used to get
excited by a vending machine and a swimming pool. These days, kids
can whine and be bored by cavernous video arcades, kids-only splash
pools, and lots of kid-friendly snack areas serving tasty junk food along
the lines of ice cream, pizza, burgers, and chicken fingers. Kids’ menus
are pretty standard in the main dining rooms, as are high chairs.
Even some of the ultraluxe lines such as Cunard and Crystal do their bit
to cater to families. Both lines have playrooms on their ships along with
supervised activities whenever demand warrants it.
Children’s activities are included in the cruise fare, though you pay for
extras like late-night babysitting (usually offered after 10 p.m.) and shore
excursions.
Though so many are, not all ships are kid-friendly. Many times older
ships (say, from the early ’90s), have small, outdated playrooms. Some
ships, usually the smaller adventure and luxury vessels, don’t have any
children’s playrooms or activities, and in a few cases, disallow kids out-
right. For example, American Canadian Caribbean Line doesn’t permit
children under 14. And for luxury lines such as Silversea and Seabourn
that technically allow kids, they certainly don’t cater to them, and they
expect, as do the other passengers, that children who come on board be
seen and not heard.
You find the most kids on ships in the Caribbean, but other regions are
gaining ground, too. In Alaska, the glaciers, Native culture, and wildlife
are interesting and educational for kids. Europe, too, is becoming more
popular with family cruisers. Aside from the port experience, kids on a
European cruise are often mingling with kids in the playroom who speak
English only as a second language, if at all, so your kids may actually
learn something about other cultures. (Explain this to your children in
advance so that they don’t think the other kids are unfriendly.) On all itin-
eraries, it’s more and more common to see multiple generations traveling
Chapter 9: Activities for Children and Teens 105

together: children, parents, and grandparents. An added bonus of course
is that grampy and grammy are built-in babysitters!
It’s Kids’ Stuff
Cruise lines set up their programs by age, similar to a summer camp, 
so that children can be involved in age-appropriate activities with their
peers. The programs start with children ages two or three (with the
exception of Disney and Cunard, you yourself are the program for a child
younger than two) and often require that toddlers are potty-trained.
Keep in mind, some cruise lines require that their youth counselors have
degrees in education or phys ed. Other lines don’t have such high stan-
dards, though don’t worry, a dishwasher from the galley won’t be watch-
ing over your little tykes either. As far as figuring out the ratio of youth
staff to kids, most don’t have one. Typically, a cruise line looks at the
passenger manifest weeks before a cruise and can assess how many
counselors to have given the number of kids on board.
There’s no way a cruise line can guess how many of the kids on board
actually come to the playrooms and participate in the activities. (Heidi’s
boys have been the only ones in the playroom, with a counselor all to
themselves, and they’ve also been two of a mob of 40 or 50 kids in their
age group, being supervised by four or five counselors.) Most lines have
a “no turn away” policy and accept all kids who want to participate.
During busy periods, like summertime and holiday weeks, this policy
means that playrooms during supervised activity times can totally turn
into a kiddy sardine can. To ease the congestion, smaller groups break
off to take walks around the ships or to do activities like drawing or
painting elsewhere, such as at an unused part of the promenade deck.
If you’re a parent who likes to keep your kiddos away from the boob
tube, first of all, you’re a rare bird, and second, keep in mind the televi-
sion(s) in the playroom often used as a way to wind kids down during
certain times of the day (say, for 15 or 30 minutes just before parents are
picking up their kids at lunchtime). The TV is always on showing movies
for the children checked into the late-night program while Mom and Dad
wine and dine alone.
The roster of kids’ activities varies from line to line, but the pickings are
better than ever. Here’s a sampling of what to expect from the big cruise
lines:
 Try your hand at cool science experiments with magnets and bub-
bles, or make a volcano (Royal Caribbean).
 Whip up ice-cream sundaes.
 Discover stuff about animation (Disney) and ocean and marine life
(Princess).
 Do some water coloring (Carnival).
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
106

 Have your face painted.
 Play computer games ala PlayStation 2 and Xboxes.
 Surf the Net (teens only).
 Design your own T-shirt.
 Take dance lessons.
 Show off your acting skills in a talent show.
 Veg in front of a large-screen TV for cartoons and movies.
Supervised activities may not be offered between about noon and 2 p.m.
and 5 and 7 p.m. each day, so counselors can take a break and grab
lunch and dinner. They usually resume again from about 7 to 10 p.m.
(after this, the babysitting program kicks in and parents are charged an
hourly rate). The exceptions to this schedule include pizza parties and
special dinners the counselors host once or twice per cruise, typically
around 6 p.m. Afterwards, the children are escorted back to the playroom
for most activities. Many parents are psyched for the break (though Heidi
actually enjoys picking rice off of the family’s pants) and the chance to get
an early start on their evenings out.
Caribbean and Bahamas sailings of the mainstream cruise lines typically
include visits to these lines’ private beaches in the Bahamas, where
watersports, barbeque lunches, and music are among the offerings for
passengers. Most private beaches also have kids’ areas of some kind,
sometimes with a playground or water park, and supervised activities.
The best for families are Disney’s Castaway Cay, Holland America’s Half
Moon Cay, Royal Caribbean’s CocoCay, and Princess’ Princess Cays. We
offer more details on these private beaches in Chapter 15.
Family Friendly? (Or Get Us off This Thing!)
As we’ve just been explaining (we hope you were paying attention),
many cruises are great family vacations. But not all ships offer the same
facilities and programs. Age minimums can vary. So can the hours of
operation. The babysitting set-up and the scope of play areas and activi-
ties can also differ. So read on for the nitty gritty and don’t be shy about
grilling your travel agent for details, too. Most cruise line Web sites also
list their programming details.
Checking out program availability and hours
Some ships offer children’s programs only seasonally — during the
summer and holiday periods when most families travel — or in certain
regions (say, in the Caribbean, but not in the Far East). Other programs
run year-round, namely those of the big-ship lines. Ask if the ship offers
the advertised program during the time you plan to sail.
Chapter 9: Activities for Children and Teens 107

Some ships operate programs for a specific age category only if a mini-
mum number of kids of that age are on board; this number varies, but is
likely about 10 or 20. Find out if your cruise has such restrictions to
avoid a tantrum (yours) once on board.
Most programs shut down during meal times, and some may not be
offered during port calls (or only on a limited basis). So if you want to
take a shore excursion, you may have to bring the kids along, which can
get expensive because most lines don’t offer substantially cheaper rates
for kids’ excursions. Lines that do operate kids programming during port
days include Disney, Carnival, and Royal Caribbean.
Keeping it real for teens
Even if your teens have vowed to mope in the cabin, dressed in black, 
to protest the weeklong separation from their significant others back
home, they may eventually break down and want to meet the other
teens. All the big-ship lines have attractive teen centers where your pre-
cious ones can hang out, pose, and make snide remarks about each
other. Activities such as dances, parties, and karaoke are typically on
the agenda, and give teens the green light to chill with peers and avoid
parents.
So that your lovely adolescent offspring can stay in touch with pals back
home, just about every ship that carries more than 100 or so passengers
offers Internet access. The big megaships have an Internet center with at
least 15 computers, and often twice that number, that operates around
the clock, or nearly so. In some cases, teen centers have a private com-
puter nook with Internet access, sometimes at discounted rates.
Keeping the kids close, if not in close quarters
Obviously bigger is better. If you can afford it, opt for a suite or two con-
necting cabins (most ships have some) to avoid getting in each other’s
hair. Family togetherness is all well and good, but after seven days in a
space no bigger than your kitchen, you don’t want to have to vote some-
one out of the cabin. Many ships now offer a handful of family suites, in
addition to a selection of minisuites and regular suites that offer more
space for families (but are also more expensive than standard cabins).
But if you’re all social butterflies flitting from one activity to another, you
may only use the cabin to sleep. If that’s the case, you can survive with
four in a standard cabin (and save some dough to boot). At the very
least, though, consider a cabin with a balcony; the extra living space can
go a long way.
If you need a crib, request one when booking your cruise, they’re com-
plimentary. Many cabins, but not all, have minifridges and some have
bathtubs, and just about all ships have 24-hour room service for order-
ing cartons of milk, sandwiches, and snacks.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
108

Knowing who’s watching your kids
Most children’s programs are designed so that kids — depending on
their ages — can come and go. Planned activities are certainly less
restrictive than day-care facilities at home. Many programs require that
kids under a certain age (usually somewhere between 9 and 13) must be
signed in and out of the activity area or playroom by a parent, though
policies on this may vary. If you grant your older kids wandering privi-
leges, emphasize that the casino is off limits. Find out, too, if the ship
requests that unsupervised children not visit the spa, gym, disco, or
other adult-oriented areas; typically these areas do not allow children
under 16 or 18 to enter. You may want to consider investing in hand-held
walkie-talkies so that you and the kids can keep tabs on each other
(though they’re incredibly annoying to everyone around you).
Most of the big-ship lines give parents of young children (say under
about 8 years old) the use of pagers, so they can be summoned if the
child needs them (and sometimes to alert you that you need to come up
to the playroom and change a dirty diaper).
Even on ships with extensive children’s programs, you’re still responsi-
ble for your children’s safety at the pool. There are rarely lifeguards, so
most programs don’t take kids to the swimming pool.
All cruise ships carrying more than a few hundred passengers have a
doctor on board, and often several nurses. Though you can visit them in
the infirmary on board if need be (there is a fee), it’s best to also bring
any special medications your children may need. It’s also smart to pack
a simple first-aid kit, complete with a thermometer and basic medicines,
so you don’t have to bother seeing the doctor for minor ailments. Also,
you may want to check your insurance to find out whether it covers you
in the unlikely event that someone needs to be transported ashore (as in
the case of appendicitis). Definitely take the time to tell your kids how
important it is to wash their hands frequently; it’s the best prevention
against gastrointestinal problems and other diseases.
Babysitting on board
Want to get through your formal dinner without cutting up anyone’s
food? A few lines offer private babysitting in your cabin between the
hours of about 8 p.m. and 1 a.m., by an off-duty female crewmember
(usually a cabin stewardess). Rates are generally about $10 an hour for
up to two children, and there’s usually a two-hour minimum. More
common is group babysitting in the playroom, which runs about $5 to $6
an hour per child. Check with your travel agent ahead of time to make
sure your cruise line’s policies haven’t changed.
The private babysitting is offered based on availability, which means
don’t dawdle. Heidi always heads to the reception desk within a few
hours of boarding to make her requests for a sitter to come to the cabin
around 8 p.m., after her kids have gone to sleep. Though it costs her
Chapter 9: Activities for Children and Teens 109

about $30 to $40 for four hours, she likes that her boys get a restful full
night sleep while she goes out gallivanting (as opposed to having her
little guys dozing on a mat or beanbag chairs in the playroom’s group sit-
ting arrangement). Also, with the group babysitting option, some ships
may impose a cap on the numbers allowed into it, so inquire within a
few hours of boarding if this is important to you.
Follow the Rules
Okay, so a ship is only so big. It’s a confined environment, so kids can get
themselves into only so much trouble. Nevertheless, you still need to drill
your kids on basic safety procedures before setting sail. The number-one
rule: Don’t lean on the railings of open decks or verandas. Although most
railings are high enough to not be of major concern for nonclimbing little
kids, make a strict rule about it to be on the safe side — particularly if you
have active kids.
Another important rule is to make sure that your children don’t go to
the pool without telling you, because most ships don’t have lifeguards.
Pools with waterslides often have staff members regulating the flow 
of traffic, but they don’t get paid to watch for little ones swimming 
unsupervised.
Make sure your children take the onboard safety drill seriously and that
they understand the safety information you and the ship provide. (Check
out Chapter 6 for more safety drill info.) Also, check that your cabin has
appropriately sized life jackets.
As on any vacation, have your children memorize the home base 
information — the ship’s name and their cabin and deck numbers — 
in case you get separated during the voyage.
Take Notes: The Best Family Cruises
The top lines for family travelers offer not only great supervised pro-
grams for kids, but also special play areas and facilities, ideally including
outdoor space too. All the major big-ship lines are family friendly to a
large degree, and offer free supervised activities daily, babysitting serv-
ice evenings at an hourly rate, and children’s menus (a la hot dogs, bur-
gers, and pasta) in some or all of their restaurants. Starting with the
best, we’ve listed the top lines for families. (Check out Part IV for more
info on these lines.)
Disney Cruise Line
The undisputed big cheese of family fun, both the Disney Magic and
Disney Wonder take top billing for their kids’ facilities and family-friendly
ships (cabins are large and feature split bathrooms). An incredible 15,000
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
110

square feet is dedicated to children’s areas (nearly half a deck), way more
than what any other line offers. Beloved Disney films are shown and the
line’s live entertainment is exceedingly family friendly and incorporates
Disney characters into fun musicals.
At least 50 counselors supervise the fun — far more than any other line,
and thus counselor-to-kid ratios are better.
Some 1,000 kids or so per cruise is par for the course. All play areas are
open to babies/toddlers if accompanied by a parent. Activities for five
age groups between 3 and 17 are offered nearly nonstop from 9 a.m. to
midnight daily (port and sea days) in two huge play spaces, a teen
center, and a nursery. Here’s just a sampling:
 The Oceaneer Club, for ages 3 to 7 (with separate activities for ages
3–4 and 5–7), is a kid-proportioned playroom with a Captain Hook
theme. Kids can climb and crawl on the bridge, ropes, and rails of a
giant pirate ship, as well as on jumbo-size animals, barrels, and a
sliding board; get dressed up from a trunk full of costumes; dance
with Snow White and listen to stories by other Disney characters;
or play in the kiddie computer room.
 The interactive Oceaneer Lab across the hall offers kids ages 8 to
12 (divided into ages 8–9 and 10–12) a chance to work on comput-
ers, learn fun science with microscopes, build from an enormous
vat of Legos, do arts and crafts, hear how animation works, and
create their own radio show.
 To keep things fresh, new activities are being introduced all the
time — 12 in 2005, for example — for the 3 to 12 set.
 For “tweens” ages from about 10 to 14, a brand new hangout space
on the Magic called Ocean Quest features a replica of the ship’s
bridge, with real live footage of the real thing upstairs. Kids can sit
in a traditional captain’s chair and play a simulation game where
they can pretend to steer the ship in and out of port. Hey, how
come the kids get to have so much fun! You can also find computer
and video games, arts and crafts, and movies.
 For teens (13–17), the great revamped teen hangout, called The
Stack on the Magic and Aloft on the Wonder, is three times the size
of the old digs and more isolated from parents. The centers have
two separate rooms, one with video screens for movies and the
other a disco with a teens-only Internet center. Dance parties,
karaoke, trivia games, improv comedy lessons, and workshops on
photography are offered for teens on all cruises, with even more
options on 7-night sailings.
 Though not complimentary like the programming for older kids, for
an hourly rate you can drop off your littlest ones, ages 3 months to
3 years, at the Flounder’s Reef Nursery. Hours are 6 p.m. to mid-
night daily, and a few hours during the morning and afternoon. No
other line offers such extensive care for babies. The room has toys
Chapter 9: Activities for Children and Teens 111

and games, plus eight cribs and a one-way porthole that allows par-
ents to check on their kids without the little ones seeing them. The
price is $6 per child per hour, and $5 for each additional child in a
family (with a two-hour minimum). Space is limited here, so reserve
your spots as early as possible. The child-to-counselor ratio is four
to one, and counselors do change diapers.
Each ship has a video arcade, though it’s really cramped compared to
most. Kids can eat lunch and dinner with counselors in the Topsider and
Beach Blanket buffet restaurants all but the first evening of the cruise.
Disney doesn’t offer private in-cabin babysitting like some lines do
during evening hours (so parents can dine alone), but along with Cunard
they are the only line offering complimentary activities and group care
until midnight (or later) in the Oceaneer Club and Lab for ages 3 to 12.
Other lines charge for this after 10 p.m.
When the ship calls on Castaway Cay, Disney’s private island in the
Bahamas, kids can head for Scuttle’s Cove, where there are barrels to
crawl through, a giant whale-dig site to explore, and more. Kids’ coun-
selors are on hand to supervise the fun if the parents want to head to
Serenity Bay, the adults-only beach (an awesome spot with a bar and
massage cabanas too!). For families who want to play together, there are
bike rentals and lots more.
Disney is the only line that has a special wading pool for diaper-wearing
babies and toddlers; all other lines forbid diapers in any of the pools (for
obvious reasons, yuck!), though many parents seem to ignore the rule
when it comes to the kiddy pools.
Royal Caribbean International
Totally well rounded for families, you can’t go wrong schlepping the whole
brood aboard the Royal Caribbean fleet. The ships offer spacious play-
rooms, teen rooms, plus lots of cool diversions for all ages, such as the
rock-climbing walls. The newest Freedom-, Voyager- and Radiance-class
ships push the envelope even further with features like miniature golf. The
innovative line was the first to introduce parent and infant/toddler play-
groups, a great thing until your tots are 3 and old enough to join the ship’s
drop-off programming. With its new Freedom of the Seas, the line really
went way overboard for kids offering the best outdoor pool space at sea
in the form of a giant water park with cannons, sprays, and jets. The ship’s
amazing surfing simulator will also drive older children wild with excite-
ment (height minimum is 52 inches). The line also revamped an older
ship, Enchantment of the Seas, and it now boasts four bungee trampolines,
two suspension bridges, and a splash pool with water jets.
Though all of Royal Caribbean’s ships are well equipped, the Freedom
takes top billing for its water park, and the Radiance-class ships and
Voyager, Adventure, and Explorer get big points for their water slides and
kids’ pools. The Freedom, Navigator, and Mariner have some 6,000 square
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
112

feet more than the other ships in the Voyager class. Other cool stuff
includes an ice-skating rink and in-line skating track on all the Voyager-
class ships, Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream (for a fee) on most ships, plus a 
mini science museum on the Explorer. Kids can visit the small labs
staffed by scientists from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration, the University of Miami, and elsewhere.
Year-round and fleetwide, Royal Caribbean offers its Adventure Ocean
supervised kids’ programs for five age groups between 3 and 17. While
at sea, the programs run from about 9 a.m. to noon, 2 to 5 p.m., and 7 to
10 p.m.; while in port, drop-off starts 30 minutes before the first shore
excursion is scheduled until 5 p.m., and then 7 to 10 p.m. Aside from the
more typical stuff to do, the line’s Adventure Science activities invite
kids to have fun and actually learn something by doing simple science
experiments appropriate to their age group. Same deal with Adventure
Art, which is all about playing with crayons, modeling clay, glitter, glue,
markers, and paint.
For participating in events, kids earn Adventure Ocean Coupons, which
they can trade in for gifts.
Following are some more activities available for specific age groups:
 Aquanauts, ages 3 to 5 (no diapers or pull ups allowed), do hands-
on science experiments with water, magnets, and gummy candies.
Art projects include mask-making (themed to the cruise itinerary)
and pottery. Story time uses popular children’s books such as
Where the Wild Things Are and The Very Hungry Caterpillar as a
basis for fun hands-on activities and arts and crafts.
 Explorers, ages 6 to 8 and Voyagers, ages 9 to 11, do science and art
programs geared to their age group, plus stuff such as reggae beach
parties, backstage tours, and more.
 Navigators, ages 12 to 14, do cool things such as learn how to be a
DJ, sports contests (sometimes pitting boys against girls . . . oohhh,
how romantic!!) and karaoke parties just to name a few activities.
 For older teens, ages 15 to 17, each ship has a teen disco and a
video arcade. Some of the ships, including the Freedom, Mariner,
Navigator, Monarch, and Sovereign of the Seas have three awesome
teen-only areas, including a nightclub, TV room, and dedicated teen
sun deck. There are also separate teen Internet centers reserved
for ages 12 to 17 and huge video arcades.
 Babies and toddlers get their due, too. RCI has hooked up with
Fisher-Price to offer supervised “play dates” for babies and tod-
dlers (6 months to 3 years) along with their parents. The 45-minute
play sessions for two age groups (Aqua Babies, 6–18 months, and
Aqua Tots, 18 months–3 years) are offered on all but embarkation
day, and incorporate music, storytelling, and a variety of Fisher-
Price toys.
Chapter 9: Activities for Children and Teens 113

Royal Caribbean offers two babysitting options: slumber party–style
group babysitting for children 3 to 12 in the playroom nightly between
10 p.m. and 1 a.m., and from noon until sailing on days the ship is in port
($5 per hour per child); and in-cabin babysitting for kids 12 months and
up, which is available from off-duty crewmembers from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m.,
and should be booked at least 24 hours in advance through the purser’s
desk ($8 per hour for up to two siblings).
Among the best trained in the biz, male and female youth staff all have
four-year college degrees in education, recreation, or a related field, plus
they’re trained in CPR and first aid.
Dinner with the youth counselors is offered on three nights of a 7-night
cruise (and once or twice on shorter cruises) in the Windjammer buffet
restaurant, Solarium cafe, or Johnny Rockets diner (depending on the
ship). Dinner runs from 6 to 7 p.m.
Royal Caribbean’s newest ships — Freedom, Voyager, Explorer, Adventure,
Mariner, Navigator, Radiance, Brilliance, Serenade, and Jewel — have spe-
cial family cabins that can accommodate six. Cabins on the older vessels
tend to be pretty small, although some can hold a third or fourth passen-
ger in upper berths.
Royal Caribbean’s drinking age fleetwide is 18 years old for wine and
beer when the ship sails in international waters, but parents have to sign
a waiver stating their awareness of this rule. If parents don’t sign, the
age is 21.
Carnival Cruise Lines
Those wild, frat boy (and girl) singles who used to define Carnival as the
party-hardy fun-ship line seem to have settled down, gotten married,
and had kids. Who would have guessed that Carnival would morph into
a family cruise line? And one of the best ones.
But don’t get us wrong, Carnival is still a fun and often rowdy line for
adults, too. It’s just that the line’s extensive kids’ facilities and program-
ming give parents plenty of opportunity to break away and party by the
pool with a bucket of beers.
The line estimates that about 525,000 kids will have sailed aboard its
ships in 2006. Some 800 children per cruise is business as usual, with a
few hundred more on Christmas and New Year’s cruises. Lots of kiddies
are around in summer, too, when it’s difficult to find a kid-free hot tub.
The Conquest-class ships (Conquest, Glory, Valor, and Liberty), the
largest and newest in the fleet, offer the best kids’ digs, occupying some
6,000 square feet. The playroom has an arts-and-crafts station, video
wall, computer lab, PlayStation 2 game units, and toys from play
kitchens to mini sliding boards, farm sets, and more. The separate and
sprawling teen center has a video wall and soda bar flowing into a huge
video arcade with three air hockey tables and more than 20 machines.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
114

The playroom and video arcade on the Spirit-class ships (Carnival Miracle,
Spirit, Legend, and Pride) are tucked away in the far forward reaches of the
bow on decks 4 and 5. Playrooms are divided into three sections con-
nected via tunnels and offer sand art, a candy-making machine, a com-
puter lab with a handful of iMacs and PlayStation 2s, and plenty of other
diversions.
The Destiny-class vessels (Destiny, Triumph, and Victory) have two-level
indoor/outdoor playrooms. The Fantasy-class ships (Ecstasy, Fantasy,
Fascination, Imagination, Inspiration, and Sensation) have two playrooms,
though they’re boxy and cramped compared to the line’s newer Fantasy-
class ships (Elation and Paradise).
The Camp Carnival program offers supervised kids’ activities on sea
days almost straight through from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. (and on port days
from 8 a.m. or earlier, depending when the first excursions are sched-
uled) for ages 2 through 14 in four age groups. All of the 10 to 16 or so
counselors are trained in CPR and first aid, and they organize the fun
and games on each ship:
 Toddlers (ages 2–5) can get into face painting, pirate hat–making,
free play, and more.
 For juniors (ages 6–8), there’s PlayStation 2, computer games, story
time and library visits, T-shirt coloring, and other stuff.
Young kids will also enjoy cavorting with Carnival’s “Fun Ship”
Freddy, a big fuzzy red, white, and blue mascot who shows up to
say hello and pose for photos.
 For intermediates (ages 9–11), there are scavenger hunts, trivia and
bingo, Ping-Pong, arts and crafts, computer games, dance classes,
and talent shows.
 Teen clubs are geared to 12 to 14 year olds (the cruise director’s
department schedules activities for the 16–18 set), and are quite
elaborate on the newest ships. Besides karaoke parties, computer
games, talent shows, and the like, teens can watch movies there
and go to dance parties. Most ships are also equipped with iMacs,
but there is no Internet center for teens only.
Activities with somewhat of an educational angle may include art proj-
ects with papier-mâché, oil paints, and watercolors; an introduction to
musical instruments; science projects where kids can make their own ice
cream and create mini helicopters; and a fitness program that encour-
ages today’s couch-potato computer-head kids to actually get up and
run around.
The entire fleet has video arcades, children’s wading pools, and for
bigger kids there’s that great corkscrew slide at the main pool of each
ship. Other pluses include a supervised kids’ mealtime in the buffet
restaurant between about 6 and 7 p.m. nightly except the first evening
and sometimes last evening(s) of the cruise.
Chapter 9: Activities for Children and Teens 115

Free supervised children’s activities are offered from 7 to 10 p.m. nightly.
After that, group slumber party–style babysitting kicks in for ages 
4 months through 11 years till 3 a.m. in the playroom (most lines only
allow kids ages 2 or 3 plus into the group babysitting). No private
babysitting is available. There’s also group babysitting between 8 a.m.
and noon on port days for the under-2 set, for $6 per hour for the first
child, $4 per hour for each additional child. On sea days between noon
and 2 p.m., you can also drop off children under two at the rate above,
or parents may use the playroom with their babies for these two hours
at no charge.
A handful of strollers are available for rent fleetwide for $25 for 7- and 
8-night cruises (less for shorter cruises) as well as a limited number of
bouncy seats, travel swings, and Game Boys. If you need to rely on a
stroller, bring your own, because there’s no guarantee you can get a
rental.
Norwegian Cruise Line
With each new ship the line introduces, the kids’ digs get better. Though
every ship in the fleet has at least a playroom, the facilities on the newer
ships Dawn, Star, Jewel, Spirit, Sun, and Pride of America are the winners
hands down. They boast huge spaces that include a separate teen center
and a wading pool, as well as a large, well-stocked playroom with areas
for movie-watching, arts and crafts, and computers. The Dawn, Star, and
Jewel have wonderful spaces with a huge climbing maze and ball bin
combo indoors and a private kids’ pool and hot tub area outside with a
fun theme (Spirit has the great outdoor area too).
On sea days, the playrooms are open 9 a.m. to noon, 2 to 4:30 or 5 p.m.,
and 7 to 10 p.m.; on port days the hours are 3 to 5 and then 7:30 or so to
10 p.m. Once per 7-night cruise, kids can dine with counselors between 
6 and 7 p.m., and then go directly to the playroom.
The line’s Kids Crew program offers year-round supervised activities for
children ages 2 to 17, divided into four age groups:
 Junior Sailors, ages 2 to 5, can enjoy arts and crafts, face painting,
story time, LEGOs, pizza making, treasure hunts, and movies.
 First Mates, ages 6 to 9, do the things above plus scavenger hunts,
painting, sports, and storytelling.
 Navigators, ages 10 to 12, also enjoy board games, the video
arcade, sports, and parties.
 Teens, ages 13 to 17, do what this age group does best: hang out.
The newer ships have a teen disco, plus there are movies, parties,
card games, sports, and PlayStation 2s.
For kids 5 to 17 with a penchant for performing, the line’s Junior Star
Seeker passenger talent competition is a big hit. Those who want to 
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
116

participate are given three minutes to perform before a panel of judges,
and the ship awards the winners a free NCL cruise.
When the free activities wind down at 10 p.m., group babysitting kicks in
for kids aged 2 to 12 nightly until 1 a.m. (and also 9 a.m.–5 p.m. on port
days) for $5 per child per hour, plus $3 an hour for each additional child.
You must sign up for babysitting in advance (the day before ideally).
Counselors do not do diapers; parents are given beepers so that they
can be alerted when it’s time for the dirty work. Private in-cabin babysit-
ting is not available.
The fleet’s older ships, the Wind, Dream, Majesty, Sky, and Sun, each
have a Kids Korner playroom, and the Pride of Aloha and Sun also have
kiddie pools and teen centers.
The Star, Dawn, Sun, Jewel, and Pride of Hawaii have a separate section
for kids in their buffet restaurants, complete with adorable mini chairs,
tables, and buffet line.
Children under age 2 cruise free (though are charged port fees and taxes).
Princess Cruises
It really shouldn’t come as a surprise that the Love Boat line, born of
flirty doctors and poolside trysts, would eventually produce some great
family ships. Though Princess isn’t the first line that comes to mind
when you think family cruising, it’s for no lack of really good facilities.
The line’s newest ships — the Grand-, Diamond-, and Coral-class ships —
have impressive facilities. Each has a spacious indoor/outdoor children’s
playroom with a splash pool, an arts-and-crafts corner, and computers or
game consoles, plus a teen center with computers, a dance floor, and a
music system. The totally huge virtual-reality game arcades are appealing
to many adults as well as kids. The two-story playrooms on Golden and
Grand have a large outside deck area dedicated to kids only, including a
teen section with a hot tub and private sunbathing area. The Caribbean
Princess, as well as the rest of the Grand- and Coral-class ships and Sun
and Dawn, have a great fenced-in outdoor playspace for toddlers, com-
plete with a fleet of three-wheelers. And the Coral, Island, Diamond, and
Sapphire Princess have a small swimming pool for adults adjacent to the
outdoor kids’ deck, so parents can relax (sort of) while supervising their
kiddies next door.
Parents can rent walkie-talkies through the purser’s desk if they want
two-way communication with their kids.
Princess’s program offers activities supervised by a staff of counselors
year-round. On sea days, the free activities are offered from 9 a.m. to
noon, 2 to 5 p.m., and 7 to 10 p.m.; on port days the hours are 8 a.m. to 
5 p.m. (including lunch) and 7 to 10 p.m. Princess divides kids into the
following age groups:
Chapter 9: Activities for Children and Teens 117

 Princess Pelicans (ages 3–7) and Princess Pirateers (ages 8–12) get
their own areas of the playroom, and offer the standards, plus tours
of the galley or behind the scenes at the theater, and sometimes
hula parties complete with grass skirts.
All play areas are open to babies/toddlers if accompanied by a
parent.
 Teens (ages 13–17) can act cool while they get into shipboard
Olympics, T-shirt painting, karaoke, Ping-Pong and basketball tour-
naments, Nintendo, and teenage versions of The Dating Game.
The line’s three older, smaller ships — the Regal, Tahitian, and Pacific —
don’t have extensive kids’ facilities, and their activities programs are
available only when 20 or more children ages 3 to 17 are on board.
On some cruises, kids and teens can actually learn more than how to lip
synch to Britney Spears songs. For something a bit more high brow, as
part of partnership with the California Science Center, kids can do
hands-on activities on Mexican Riviera sailings, from stargazing to study-
ing ocean and coral reef habitats, building and racing sailboats, launch-
ing rockets, and dissecting gooey squid. Budding naturalists can take a
gander at the activity books and other learning materials provided by
the National Wildlife Federation. These opportunities were designed to
complement the line’s Junior Ranger program in Alaska and the Save our
Seas environmental program, which operates fleet-wide.
Twice per cruise, kids can dine with counselors, so parents get a break.
Younger kids can then be taken straight to group babysitting in the chil-
dren’s center (available nightly 10 p.m.–1 a.m. for kids 3–12; $5 per hour,
per child). Teens have their own group night in one of the main dining
rooms. Princess does not offer private in-cabin babysitting.
While Princess offers really good facilities and amenities for parents and
children, its ships aren’t overrun with children. In fact, a Princess reser-
vations agent told us that they cap the total number of kids under 18 at
about 14 to 15 percent of a ship’s capacity. Heidi took her young sons on
the 3,100-passenger Caribbean Princess (3,782 maximum occupancy) that
maxed out at about 600 children, which is a far cry from the 800 to 1,200
kids under 18 that lines such as Carnival, Disney, and Royal Caribbean
routinely see. The play areas were never jammed like they sometimes
are on the other lines.
Celebrity Cruises
We love Celebrity. The line is a pro at pleasing adults with its gorgeous
ships, innovative entertainment and dining, and top spas. And though
they’re hardly as kid-focused as some of the lines mentioned earlier in
this chapter, they do a pretty good job of catering to children, too. All
the ships in the fleet have a playroom with decent features, but the line’s
four newest and biggest Millennium-class ships (which also include 
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
118

the Constellation, Infinity, and Summit) take top honors. Each has an
indoor/outdoor playroom complex that includes a fenced-in outdoor
soft-surface jungle gym and a wading pool, plus inside a computer room,
movie room, an arts-and-crafts area, and video arcade. Teens get a sepa-
rate center.
Supervised activities are offered year-round. During kid-intensive times,
namely holidays and summers, activities are geared toward four age
groups. Hours are 9 a.m. to noon, 2 to 5 p.m., and 7 to 10 p.m.; and on
sea days, hours start 30 minutes before the first shore excursion. Kids
can dine with the counselors on most nights of the cruise between 
5 p.m. and 7 p.m.; the service is free on sea days (and one formal night)
and offered at the hourly group-babysitting rate on port days.
 Ship Mates, ages 3 to 6 (who are potty trained), can go gaga over
treasure hunts, clown parties, T-shirt painting, dancing, movies, ship
tours, mask-making and parades around the ship, and ice-cream-
sundae-making parties.
 Cadets, ages 7 to 9, have all of the above plus computer games.
 Ensigns, ages 10 to 12, can get into karaoke, computer games, trivia
contests, arts and crafts, movies, and pizza parties.
 Teens, ages 13 to 17 (and divided into two groups, 13–15 and
16–17), who don’t think themselves too cool to join in, can sign up
for the talent shows, karaoke, pool games, and trivia contests. The
Century-class and Millennium-class ships have attractive teen
discos/hangout rooms.
Summer-stock theater presentations, involve three age groups: the Ship
Mates and Cadets sing, dance, and act, and the Ensigns direct and pro-
duce the plays.
For the 3 to 12 set, educational activities with a science theme may
include learning about insects and thunderstorms, to listening to dol-
phins and whales communicate under water.
For toddlers under age 3 (in or out of diapers), parents can accompany
their kids to the playroom and enjoy age appropriate toys.
Group babysitting in the playroom is available for ages 3 to 12 every
evening from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. for children ages 3 to 12, and between
noon and 2 p.m. on port days, for $6 per child per hour. Private in-cabin
babysitting in the evening by a female crewmember is available on a lim-
ited basis for $8 per hour for up to two children (kids must be at least 
6 months old); make your request 24 hours in advance.
The drinking age on Celebrity sailings is 18 for beer and wine whenever
a ship is in international waters, but parents have to sign a waiver stat-
ing their awareness of this rule. If parents don’t sign, the age is 21.
Chapter 9: Activities for Children and Teens 119

Holland America Line
In the old days, Holland America was pretty much an old folks’ line. In
the past few years, though, Holland America has made a great effort to
ditch this rep. The biggest change to the Club HAL program of late is the
lowering of the age minimum from 5 down to 3.
When enough are on board, kids are divided into three age groups.
You can find the most children on cruises during summers and holiday
weeks — for example, as many as 300 to 400 kids aboard the new Vista-
class ships (Zuiderdam, Oosterdam, and Westerdam), especially in the
Caribbean. Otherwise, around 100 to 200 is typical. Every ship has at
least one full-time Club HAL youth director and playrooms stocked with
toys and games, computers, and a large-screen TV for movies. Each also
has a small video arcade.
When demand warrants, typically during summers and holidays, pro-
gram hours are 9 a.m. to noon, 2 to 4:30 or 5 p.m., and 7 to 10 p.m.
 Kids ages 3 through 7 can enjoy storytelling, arts and crafts, face
painting, pizza and ice-cream parties, ship tours, and bingo.
 For children 8 through 12, there’s golf ball putting, sports tourna-
ments, scavenger hunts, movies, karaoke, air hockey, foosball, and
Internet access.
 Teens 13 to 17 are getting a lot of respect from Holland America
these days. All ships have a separate teen center with a big-screen
TV, Internet access, video games, karaoke, and a music system. A
cool private outdoor sun deck area called Oasis aboard most ships
(Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Volendam, Zaandam, and Statendam class)
has lounge chairs, a 9-foot-high waterfall, snack machines, and a
music system. Activities there include dance parties, luaus, and
sporting (the line’s smallest ship, the globetrotting Prisendam, does
not have kids facilities).
Group babysitting is offered daily for the 3 to 12 set between 10 p.m. and
midnight at $5 an hour per child; in-cabin babysitting is offered fleetwide
if a crewmember is available, at $8 an hour per child and $5 for each
additional child.
If you sail in the Caribbean, the line has its own private island, called
Half Moon Cay. It’s an awesome place for families, with a kids’ aqua park
on the beach, plus neat excursions for the family, from horseback riding
to snorkeling with stingrays.
The line also offers some supervised activities on port days, depending
on the number of counselors available.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
120

A couple surprise contenders
Aside from all these big-ship lines — which for the most part are all
things to all people of all ages — a handful of lines that you may think
don’t give a hoot about pleasing families really are quite family friendly.
Cunard connotes pomp and circumstance, God Save the Queen, and
scones. But snotty noses? Ball bins? Xboxes? Indeed, the Queen Mary 2
is about tradition, taste, and elegant things, but Cunard’s new grande
dame offers one of the most comprehensive kids’ programs at sea.
Complimentary activities are offered all day long until midnight for chil-
dren as young as one (most lines only start their programming at ages
two or three). The youth staff includes a couple of British nannies that
have completed a special two-year program in England.
The comfy playroom at the aft of deck 6 can be divided up to accommo-
date different age groups. Just outside on deck is a small wading pool,
spray fountain, and another play gym. Here’s the age breakdown:
 For kids ages 1 to 6, there are plenty of toys, arts and crafts, a play
gym, and a ball bin, plus a separate nursery with cribs and toddler
beds for naptime.
 For the 7 to 12 set, half of the playroom is stocked with beanbag
chairs, board games, TVs, and Xboxes for video-game playing.
 Teens do stuff around the ship such as behind-the-scenes tours and
watching movies in the theater. Plus, teenagers with a cerebral side
will totally enjoy the ship’s cool planetarium, gym, and extensive
library and bookshop.
All play areas are open to babies/toddlers if accompanied by parent.
Dining options include the King’s Court buffet restaurant and the special
children’s “tea” offered daily from 5 to 6 p.m. in the Chef’s Galley room,
where kid can order chicken fingers, pasta and the like.
Moving 180 degrees away from finger sandwiches and stiff upper lips 
is Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, all rum swizzles and tube tops.
Adventurous kids who can part with their laser tag and Game Boys for 
a week, will embrace the freewheeling fun of a Windjammer tall ship,
whose fleet sails through the more picturesque parts of the Caribbean.
These ships are like summer camp for the whole family, only here, par-
ents can unwind with a Red Stripe while the wind catches the sails and
pushes the ship into the next day of adventure.
For ages 6 to 17, three of the fleet’s five eccentric sailing ships offer
“Junior Jammer” kids programs during the summer.
On itineraries in the Bahamas, Costa Rica, and the southern Caribbean
islands of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao, the Legacy and Polynesia have
counselors for two main age groups (6–11 and 12–17) who supervise
Chapter 9: Activities for Children and Teens 121

activities between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. daily in empty cabins or in unused
public rooms:
 Younger kids get to do arts and crafts, face paint, hair braid, build
sand castles, knot tying, hoist the sails, and visit the bridge.
 Teens can do stuff such as sailing, snorkeling, volleyball, navigat-
ing, and kayaking.
 There are even introductory scuba classes for 8- to 10-year-olds
and 11- to 16-year-olds.
One child between 6 and 11 sails free June through early August when
sharing a cabin with parents.
Though none of Windjammer’s ships carries more than 122 passengers
(double occupancy), so many families are drawn to this quirky line that
30 or 40 kids per cruise during the summer is par for the course. That
nearly qualifies as a kiddie mob considering how small these ships are.
And the ultra-casual, “anything goes” atmosphere puts to rest any fear of
the kids disturbing the neighbors. With flip-flops and tank tops about as
formal as it gets, who’s going to complain about a little noise?

T
he kind of ship you pick for yourself says something
about your personality — just as does the house you live
in, the car you drive, or the beer you drink. In this part, we
review all the major cruise lines and a healthy selection of the
smaller, more niche-oriented players, giving you the scoop on
everything from 3,000-passenger megaships to six-passenger
schooners. Which one’s for you? Though we focus primarily
on ships that sail the major cruise regions (the Caribbean,
Alaska, and the Mediterranean), we also include details on
the ships’ other itineraries, from the Far East to Antarctica
and off in every other direction you can name.

S
ome people say cruise ships are all the same. Other people yell back
at them, telling them they’re nuts. The first people get all huffy, “But
it’s true! They’re all just these giant slab-sided beasts where you eat and
drink till you pop.” The second people shout back, “You moron, what
about the smaller, high-end ships, where it’s like you’re on a quiet, pri-
vate yacht?” First people say, “Yeah, well I can’t afford that!” Second
people say, “So? Then book on one of the premium mainstream lines;
they’re much more high-toned, like old-fashioned ocean liners.” First
people say, “Who needs high-toned? I want adventure!” Second people
say, “So go to Maine and sail on a schooner. You can even help hoist the
sails!” First people say, “What, you think you know everything?” Second
people say, “Yeah, of course we do. We wrote the For Dummies book,
didn’t we?”
So, there you have it. Different ships for different folks, and to give you
some idea of which is which, we use a kind of shorthand in the following
chapters to help you sort ships according to your tastes. This chapter
explains all those categories and what the different ratings and labels
mean. Reading through this chapter saves you time by giving you key
words and phrases to look for in the reviews so that you can find the
cruise lines and ships that best fit your tastes and those of your spouse
or other cruise companions.

Getting a Handle on the Big Picture
Each cruise line review begins with two shorthand notes about the kind
of experience the line offers, one ephemeral and one concrete.
Type of cruise
This note refers to the more ephemeral cruise experiences that a ship
has to offer. Here we break down the three major categories of cruise
lines we discuss in Chapter 3, and suggest a bit more detail about what
to expect on a particular cruise.
Mainstream cruises are the big boys of the cruise biz, with mostly giant
ships offering the latest attractions designed to appeal to the widest vari-
ety of travelers. “Premium” lines are ginned-up mainstreamers, offering a
more refined experience but without the super polish (or super-high
prices) of the true luxury lines. Among the mainstream and premium
lines, some ships tend to offer cruises geared more to families, party
types, or romantic types, though you may be surprised at how many are
able to offer all three. We use the description resort ships to refer to
those that are just good all-around vessels with a range of activities and
entertainment for everybody: families, partiers, romantic types, and
everybody else too.
Almost every cruise line claims that they’re luxurious, while few really are.
The lines we call luxury cruises, though, really are: They walk the walk
rather than just talking the talk. These are the ones that stick to the high-
est standards: exceptional service, refined décor, luxurious accommoda-
tions, a sophisticated ambience, and truly fine cuisine. They also tend to
sail more wide-ranging itineraries, rarely doing season-long round-trip
cruises from the same homeports, the way most mainstream ships do.
That gives you a much wider range of destinations from which to choose.
Though their prices are higher, they also tend to be more inclusive than
mainstream lines, with their rates often covering wines and spirits, gratu-
ities, and sometimes some shore excursions. On old-money lines, very
traditional passengers enjoy a very traditional experience. On active
luxury lines, the focus may be on taking out a Waverunner or sailboard
rather than on putting on the tux for evening cocktails. Two luxe lines,
Crystal and Cunard, even appeal to families.
Adventure and educational cruises are your best bet if you’re after an
experience that offers in-depth learning about a destination’s nature and
culture rather than quick port calls and onboard relaxation. These ships
rarely carry more than 200 passengers, and usually have naturalists and
historians aboard to interpret what you’re seeing. Within the small-ship
world, some are learning cruises that go full-throttle into the educa-
tional aspects of travel, with onboard experts from leading nature publi-
cations offering lectures and helping with nature interpretation. Others
are active adventure cruises which also offer naturalists and historians,
but focus more on getting passengers out into nature via kayaks, hiking,
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
126

and trips by inflatable landing craft. Sailing ships are just that — ships
with sails, some of them offering passengers the chance to help haul 
the lines and pull up the centerboard. Other small-ship cruises are just
miniaturized versions of the big-ship cruises, bringing you to a range of
ports and natural areas but eschewing busy onboard activities in favor
of a quiet, low-key vibe.
Ship size/style
The size and type of a ship you choose can make a huge difference in the
kind of experience you ultimately have. Fortunately, you have a tremen-
dous range to choose from. Options run the gamut from giant megaships
to the tiniest of tiny vessels — some carrying fewer than 20 passengers.
A ship’s size is expressed not in actual 2,000-pound tons but in gross regis-
tered tons (GRTs), a figure that measures enclosed, interior space used to
produce revenue on a vessel (cabins, dining areas, lounges, video game
rooms, and so on). Tonnage, in ship terms, is a measure of volume rather
than weight. One gross registered ton actually represents 100 cubic feet of
enclosed, revenue-generating space. The following list gives you a handle
on the various shapes and styles of ships that fall under each designation:
 Megaships: When the word “megaship” came into common usage 
in the late 1990s, it meant ships that were up around 80,000 GRTs.
Those ships still count as mega, but today the megaship category
also includes vessels literally twice that size, ranging up to Royal
Caribbean’s Freedom of the Seas (160,000 GRTs) and Cunard’s Queen
Mary 2 (151,400 GRTs). Megaships carry from about 1,750 to more
than 3,000 passengers.
Big on glitz, megaships promote loads of activities, attract families
and a large share of the under-50 crowd, offer large public rooms
(including fancy casinos and fully equipped gyms and spas), and
provide a wide variety of dining and entertainment options. They
tend to visit crowd-pleasing ports, but in many ways the ships
themselves are the main attraction, with the ports as an added bit
of fun.
Most ships in the fleets of Carnival, Celebrity, Costa, Disney,
Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL), Princess, and Royal Caribbean are
megaships, though some of these lines also maintain smaller and
frequently older ships as well. Holland America’s fleet is currently
split between an older generation of midsize vessels and newer
megas, while MSC Cruises is busy building a slew of new megaships
to augment its existing fleet of midsize vessels.
 Traditional-style ships: These ships are modern with a traditional-
style twist, often in the midsize range (carrying around 700 to 1,500
passengers). They generally provide subdued, old-fashioned décor
and an onboard atmosphere geared primarily to older and/or more
tradition-minded passengers. Many Holland America ships fit into
this category, as do Oceania’s 684-passenger ships.
Chapter 10: The How-to of Comparative Cruise Shopping 127

 Modern midsize ships: These ships run about the same size as the
traditional-style midsize vessels but with a more contemporary
décor and ambience. Some are simply smaller equivalents of their
megasized sisters, providing the same kind of party atmosphere but
with fewer partiers — Royal Caribbean’s Empress of the Seas fits
that description, as do several of the older NCL ships. Other ves-
sels, such as Celebrity’s Zenith, provide a more stylish, less party-
oriented experience. Ditto for luxurious ships such as Regent Seven
Seas’ luxurious Seven Seas Voyager and Seven Seas Mariner and
Crystal’s Crystal Symphony and Crystal Serenity, the latter of which
are downright glamorous. Luxe lines Silversea and Regent also have
smaller midsize ships carrying around 400 to 500 passengers.
 Small ships: Small ships can negotiate shallow waters and dock
places where larger ships can’t go, allowing them to plan more
adventurous itineraries. Smaller ships tend to operate at a more
relaxed pace, and have fewer children on board, adding to the
sense of calm. In addition, the combination of smaller public space
and less entertainment creates an atmosphere in which you spend
a lot of time talking to other passengers. Some small ships (such as
the Seabourn and SeaDream vessels) are among the most luxurious
afloat, whereas others (such as those operated by American
Canadian Caribbean) are among the most bare-bones. The rest fall
somewhere in between.
 Sailing ships: If you dream of doing the Errol Flynn thing, or if
you’re a purist when it comes to taking to the seas, a sailing ship
may be your ticket. Sailing ship experiences run the gamut, from
the authenticity of the Maine Windjammers (many of which are
more than 100 years old, and work on sail power alone) to the
modern yachts of Windstar, which are some of the largest and most
technically advanced sailing ships ever built. Windjammer Barefoot
Cruises, down in the Caribbean, offers a bare-boned but raucous
sailing adventure, while Star Clippers is more high-toned yet still
casual. More than with any other type of cruising, you’ll know it if
this is the type of cruise for you. No one is wishy-washy about a
sailing ship. You either love them or you don’t.
Note that except for the Maine Windjammers, none of the sailing
ships we review in Chapter 13 operate on sail power alone; all also
have engines, which often account for most of the ship’s propulsion
and are a necessary evil if you want to keep any kind of regular
schedule.
In a few cases, a ship falls between a couple of different categories, or it
seems so unusual in one way or another that it doesn’t exactly fit into
one of these categories. We place these ships in whatever category we
feel is the nearest fit.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
128

Grasping the Ins and Outs of Itineraries
Every cruise line review lists where all of its ships will sail in 2007, to the
extent that schedules had been determined by the lines when we went
to press. Because cruise lines tend to do some last-minute jostling, itin-
eraries are subject to change. Be sure to check with a travel agent or
with the lines’ Web sites for day-by-day listings of the ports each itiner-
ary visits, and verify sailing dates before you go too far in your planning.
The number of days we list for each cruise represents the number of full
days (including nights) you spend on board — we don’t count the hour
or two you’re on board on the last day of your cruise, waiting to get off
the ship. For example, cruises that begin and end on a Sunday count as
7-day cruises, even though some cruise line brochures may refer to them
as 8-day itineraries.
Getting the Skinny on Specifications
So you can compare different ships, we also include a table with each
cruise line review that lists their ships’ vital statistics: size, passenger
capacity (based on double occupancy of cabins), number of crew,
number of cabins, tonnage, and overall length.
To get a rough idea of how crowded a ship feels, divide its tonnage by its
total passenger capacity to arrive at the passenger/space ratio. To get an
idea of how personal the service is, divide the total number of passen-
gers by the total number of crew to get the passenger/crew ratio.
Getting a Handle on Prices
As we note in Chapter 4, people hardly ever pay full price for a cruise
unless they’re booking with some of the small niche lines, which are the
exception that proves the rule. Cruise line brochure prices are typically
wildly inflated, representing what the line’s executives dream about
pocketing from each booking. In reality, they charge only a fraction of
that — sometimes as little as 50 percent. Royal Caribbean and Celebrity
recently stopped printing brochure prices at all, recognizing they bear
almost no relation to reality.
Prices listed on the cruise lines’ Web sites are usually a lot closer to
what you’ll actually pay, but we’ve gone one step further by having a
travel agent, Nashville’s Just Cruisin’ Plus (% 800-888-0922; www.just
cruisinplus.com), investigate every single ship in this book and tell us
what their customers were actually paying during a common sampling
period. Other travel agencies and online sites will generally offer similar
rates.
Chapter 10: The How-to of Comparative Cruise Shopping 129

Because ships offer itineraries of varying lengths (making it difficult to
compare prices), we’ve listed the sample prices as per diems. In other
words, what you see are daily per-person rates for a cruise. To figure out
what your total cost would be, just multiply that by the number of days
in the itinerary.
When you look at a cruise line’s brochure or Web site, you’re likely to
see that they offer sometimes a dozen or more different levels of state-
rooms, but at the most basic level they can all be broken down into
three types:
 Inside cabins: Cabins without windows
 Outside cabins: Cabins that have portholes, picture windows, and
sometimes private balconies
 Suites: Ranging from glorified staterooms with an extra seating area
to presidential-size mansions that may have more square footage
than your house, usually with a large private balcony or two
The sample rates include per diems for the lowest-priced option in those
three categories. Generally speaking, the largest and most desirable
inside cabins are priced closer to the rate we list for the lowest-level out-
side cabins; the largest and most desirable outside cabins are priced
closer to the rate we list for the lowest-level suite; and the biggest suites
are priced far, far higher than what we list for the low-level suites.
Because this book covers many different cruise regions, our sample
prices may not be an exact reflection of what you can expect to pay in
some regions. Cruises in Alaska, Hawaii, and the Mediterranean, for
example, are almost always more expensive than comparable cruises in
the Caribbean and the Mexican Riviera. The prices we list are meant as a
guide only and are in no way etched in stone — the price you pay may be
higher or even lower, depending on when you choose to travel, when you
book, what specials the lines are offering, and a slew of other factors.
Rates are generally cruise only (without airfare or hotel rooms), per
person, and based on double occupancy of a cabin. Unless noted other-
wise, prices listed include port charges (the per-passenger fee that ports
charge for ships to dock), but not government taxes.

 Getting the lowdown on the mainstream cruise experience

T
he ships we feature in this chapter range from comfortably large
decade-old ships to the biggest new megaships — some of them
nearly four times the size of the Titanic, but with technological features
that’d be more at home on the International Space Station.
If luxury ships are more your style, see Chapter 12. At the other end of
the spectrum, check out Chapter 13 for a discussion of smaller adven-
ture and expedition-type vessels.
Why the Masses Flock to the Megaships
Some ships these days are so gigantic that they can offer more diver-
sions than your average midsize town, but even ships that aren’t quite
so enormous can fit that description, too. Mainstream ships have the
classics — swimming pools, health clubs and spas, nightclubs and bars,
movie theaters, casinos, shops, kids’ playrooms, and open decks. You
can also find sports decks, virtual golf, computer rooms, cigar clubs,
martini bars, and sometimes learning centers that offer classes that
range from history to commerce to theater arts. Ship design has come
so far that, even on vessels carrying 3,000 or more passengers, you can
still find nooks to get away from it all. You may even find yourself won-
dering where all those other people are.
Mainstream ships have large dining rooms and buffet areas that serve as
much food with as much variety and at almost as many times as a 24-
hour New York diner — and with better views to boot. Many offer formal
nights when you can dine in your tux or gown if you like, while others

are casual 24/7. Beyond their large traditional restaurants, most main-
stream ships these days also offer some combination of intimate, roman-
tic, alternative restaurants; casual restaurants where you can grab a
hamburger, hot dog, veggie burger, or a slice of pizza; buffets stuffed to
the gills with everything from cold cuts to Indian food; ice-cream par-
lors; caviar bars; and specialty coffee and snack bars. Wash it all down
with a drink — maybe from the ship’s wine, champagne, or martini bars,
or with a few beers at the sports bar.
You can find onboard activities such as games and contests, classes and
lectures, and a variety of entertainments, including large-scale produc-
tion shows, quiet pianists, not-so-quiet dance bands, operatic recitals,
magicians, comedians, and more.
In the cabins, you can find many of the typical accoutrements of modern
American life: TVs (and sometimes DVD players), telephones, hair dryers,
and sometimes dataports, minibars, private safes, and fuzzy bathrobes.
The cabins themselves range from windowless cubbyholes to enormous
suites. You can upgrade from a typical window cabin to one with a private
veranda so that you can lounge out in the open air.
The possible downside to all that bigness? Crowds. Because these ships
may carry upwards of 2,000 or 3,000 passengers, getting stuck in some
lines is inevitable — at the buffet, for example, or when getting off the
ship in port. Some megaships are so well-designed, though, that things
flow smoothly even when full.
Where the Mainstream Ships Go
Mainstream is as mainstream does, so the itineraries of the biggest ships
tend to include mostly tried-and-true ports — nothing too far out of the,
well, mainstream, but that’s not necessarily bad, especially if you’re just
looking for a good time. Wherever the megaships dock, expect lots of
shopping, drinking, and eating options, plus huge lists of shore excur-
sions to take you far away from those things: out into the jungles, up
into the mountains, under the sea, or sometimes deep into history.
Some of the smaller mainstream ships also visit less-crowded ports,
away from the typical tourist crowds. The smaller the ship, the more it is
able to access smaller harbors, where the smaller number of passengers
on board aren’t likely to overwhelm the town.
The rates we list here are sample per diems that approximate the actual
per-day prices passengers were paying as this book went to press. The
rates you find may be higher or lower, depending on market fluctuations.
To arrive at an approximation of your full vacation’s cost, just multiply
the per diem by the number of nights in the itinerary.

The top banana of the cruise world, Carnival has been dishing up fun at
sea since company patriarch Ted Arison launched the Mardi Gras way
back in 1972. More than 30 years and some 22 ships later, Carnival has
evolved and improved, though the core remains the same: let-your-hair-
down fun on outrageously themed ships. The line attracts a real mix —
from those with beer bellies and tattoos to types with graduate degrees
and Gucci loafers. A Carnival ship is the ultimate American melting pot.
Bob Marley blasts from the Pool Deck as happy campers young and 
old swig Buds and drink in that wild Carnival take on a classic 
Caribbean vacation. Sure, you can now find sushi and wine bars, but the
ships are still all about partying into the wee hours and over-the-top
flamboyance — where else would you find a giant tattooed hands or
King Tut’s tomb decorating a lounge? Carnival puts its whimsical spin on
themes from ancient Egypt and Greece to the Renaissance, New Orleans,
Billie Holiday, and Neil Armstrong. The One Small Step disco on the
Valor, for example, is a tribute to Armstrong’s walk on the moon. White
mini-volcanolike craters several feet tall glow with LED lighting, the ceil-
ing is a sea of twinkling lights, and the floor is made from moonlike white
marble and granite, and covered, of course, with astronaut “footprints.”
While food and service are pretty much average — not surprising con-
sidering the large numbers served — that doesn’t stop the line from
trying to offer a higher-quality vacation. Recent enhancements include
partnering with three-star Michelin French Master Chef Georges Blanc to
design special dishes in the restaurants, plus upgrades like switching
from plastic to china in the buffet restaurants, and equipping cabins
with thicker towels, duvets, and more TV channels. These extra touches
along with the line’s other assets — large cabins, professional service,
lots of entertainment, and great kids’ facilities — keep the masses
coming back for more. And boy, has Carnival cashed in.
Carnival offers a Vacation Guarantee program: Any guest dissatisfied
with the cruise while on board can disembark at the first non-U.S. port of
call and receive a refund for the unused portion of their fare, plus reim-
bursement for air transportation back to the ship’s homeport. To qualify,
passengers must inform the purser before their first port of call.

three-star Michelin French Master Chef Georges Blanc, who has created
special dishes featured on the restaurant menus. On a recent Liberty
cruise, the Georges Blanc dishes really were quite good, including the deli-
cious grilled jumbo shrimp in Beurre Blanc. Otherwise, don’t expect gour-
met. Geared toward a middle-American audience, just like its mainstream
peers, you can find plenty of the basics — steaks, fish, and pasta — to go
with choices such as sushi and Chinese food. Each ship has a main dining
room or two that operate the traditional early and late seatings, plus a
casual buffet restaurant operating nearly round the clock (including
dinner nightly). An intimate reservations-only supper club/steakhouse fea-
tures live music and the ships’ most expertly prepared meals, with a $30
per person cover, on the line’s newer ships: Carnival Spirit, Pride, Legend,
Miracle, Conquest, Glory, Valor, Liberty, and Freedom. For casual, try pizza,
calzones, and Caesar salads available 24 hours a day; late-night buffet
spreads; patisseries for fancy coffees (for a charge); and room service.
There’s no shortage of bars, many with a healthy dose of Carnival’s
wacky design whimsy (try oyster shell wallpaper and furry bar stools).
Activities and entertainment
You won’t be bored if big, flashy stage shows are your bag. Carnival
doesn’t hold back, with lavish sets and casts of 8 to 16 cast members
decked out in over-the-top costumes. Live six- to ten-piece orchestras
accompany the dancers and lead singers. During a typical weeklong
cruise, comedians, jugglers, acrobats, blaring poolside pop bands, country-
and-western bands, classical string trios, pianists, and big bands are a
part of the mix. The theaters on the Destiny-class, Spirit-class, and
Conquest-class ships are spectacular three-deck extravaganzas, and the
casinos are so large you may think you’ve died and gone to Vegas; but
even aboard its smaller, older ships, Carnival consistently offers some 
of the most fun and flamboyant entertainment extravaganzas afloat.
Speaking of wacky, Carnival’s big on silly poolside games, such as belly-
flop contests and pillow fights. Doesn’t get much more cerebral than
that, unless you think stuff like game shows, dancing lessons, and art
auctions are brain food.
For kids
Among the top lines for kids, Camp Carnival delivers fun for toddlers
through teens. The newest Conquest-class ships (see Figure 11-1) have
the biggest and best digs with awesome teen centers and video arcades,
but the entire fleet has good playrooms and the line’s signature snaking
water slide on the Pool Deck. Complimentary activities are scheduled
nearly all day long. For an hourly fee, group babysitting for ages 4
months through 12 is offered nightly, plus for a few hours on port days.

When they turn down the cabins each night, room stewards get goofy 
by making bathroom towels into fluffy animals and displaying them on
the beds.

Fleet facts
The Carnival Destiny was, in her first year (1996), the biggest ship in the
world, and she offers the “wows” you’d expect of a ship her size, including
huge spa and gym areas. The Carnival Triumph and Carnival Victory
are the Carnival Destiny’s slightly bigger siblings. A stretched version of
these ships, the Carnival Conquest, debuted in the fall of 2002, and three
sisters entered service in successive years: the Carnival Glory, Valor,
and Liberty. At press time, a fifth sister, Carnival Freedom, was slated for
a March 2007 debut. These ships are about 60 feet longer, with tonnage of
110,000 GRTs, and boast massive kids’ and teen areas and the line’s signa-
ture flamboyant décor.
In 2001, the line introduced a relatively small (by megaship standards)
class of ship: the 2,124-passenger, 84,000-ton Carnival Spirit, which
boasts an outdoor promenade and a supper club. Carnival Pride,
Carnival Legend, and Carnival Miracle arrived in the years following.
These vessels all offer the most successful design elements of Carnival’s
earlier classes of ships, including many bars and lounges.
Carnival’s Fantasy-class ships — the Ecstasy, Elation, Fantasy,
Fascination, Imagination, Inspiration, Paradise, and Sensation —
differ in their wacky décor but otherwise are the exact same size and
have identical layouts and Carnival’s roomy cabin size. They’re good
party ships, though a tad aged. If there was Botox for cruise ships, these
guys could probably use a shot. The Celebration and Holiday are the
older, non-megaships in the Carnival fleet. They seem really ancient and
out of date compared to their newer fleetmates, but they have roomy
cabins and are often priced cheaper than the line’s other ships.

 Type of cruise: Family, resort, romantic
 Ship size/style: Modern, stylish midsize and megaships
We’ll just admit it right now, we’re in love with Celebrity. Who could
resist the most elegant big ships in the biz? Celebrity offers a refined
experience, but isn’t stuffy. There’s plenty of fun to be had and lots of
activities to keep you busy, but you can always find a quiet spot, too, for
some good old-fashioned R & R. Each ship is glamorous and comfort-
able, mixing sleekly modern and Art Deco styles and throwing in cutting-
edge art collections to boot.
Hands down, Celebrity has the best vessels in the mid-priced category —
the Century, Galaxy, Mercury (see Figure 11-2), and especially the newer
Millennium, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation. Celebrity gets the “best 
of” nod in a lot of categories: The art collections the most compelling
fleetwide, the décor the most original, the AquaSpas on the line’s mega-
ships are tops, and the onboard activities and entertainment among the
most varied. Dining-wise, Celebrity shines with its dashing alternative
restaurants on the Millennium-class ships, the best at sea for both quality
of food and their gorgeous décor.
From its beginnings, the polite and professional staff has been a cut
above the competition and contributes greatly to the elegant mood.
Passengers, who range in age from 20-something honeymooners to
retirees, are pampered in a low-key, non-invasive way. Like all the big-
ship lines, Celebrity offers lots for its passengers to do, but the cruise
line steers away from the standards. Innovative entertainment includes
roving a cappella groups, while expert-led seminars on topics such as
astronomy, photography, personal investing, and history offer a little
more cerebral fare than the usual. The latest: acupuncture and holistic
healing theme cruises and Cirque du Soleil–inspired shows.
Art is an important aspect of the Celebrity experience. It’s everywhere
on board and no other line in the industry comes close to offering col-
lections as intriguing. The Summit, for example, has Woman With Fruit,
a large bronze of a rotund woman by noted Colombian artist Fernando
Botero (the sculpture overlooks the ship’s thalassotherapy pool area),
as well as an ART sculpture by LOVE artist Robert Indiana. There are
also originals on the ships by David Hockney, Jasper Johns, Jeff Koons,
David Levinthal, Liza Lou, Andy Warhol, and many others.

Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 141

Dining
Michel Roux, Celebrity’s famous culinary consultant and one of the top
French chefs in Britain, guides all Celebrity cuisine. His talents and
legacy shine brightest in the intimate alternative dining venues on the
Millennium-class ships, where you can have just about the best dining
experience available at sea.
The Millennium has a special reservations-only dining room with a great
feature: hand-carved wood panels that were created for the Olympic
(sister ship to the Titanic) and graced that vessel’s A La Carte restaurant
from 1911 to 1935. The dining experience in the restaurant created
around these panels is leisurely and luxurious, styled after liners cruis-
ing in the Golden Age of sea travel (although be prepared to enjoy it for
three hours). The line offers comparably fine restaurants with intriguing
décor on the Infinity, Summit, Constellation, and Century. The cost at
these venues is $30 per person, and is totally worthwhile. Feast on appe-
tizers such as a tartare of salmon garnished with quail eggs or goat
cheese soufflé with tomato coulis, followed by entrees such as shrimp
scampi flambéed in Armagnac or rack of lamb coated with mushroom
duxelles and wrapped in a puff pastry. For dessert, try saying no to the
chocolate soufflé or a plate of Michel Roux’s favorite bite-size desserts.
On all but the Zenith, the ships’ main dining rooms are lovely two-deck-
high affairs with a dramatic staircase at the center sharing the attention
with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the ships’ wake — quite a sight on a
moonlit night. Cuisine here is good, but not fantastic, and is on par with
other big-ship lines. Each ship also has a buffet restaurant operating for
all meals, but unlike other big ships, waiters are typically on hand to
carry your tray to a table. Dinner is served here most nights (including a
sushi bar), but reservations are requested.
There’s also a specialty coffee bar — the Cova Cafe — and each
Millennium-class ship has a Spa Cafe in a corner of the thalassotherapy
pool area serving an appealing light and healthy breakfast (such as fresh
fruit, bagels, and lox) and lunch (including raw veggie platters, vegetar-
ian sushi, and pretty tuna or chicken salads). Several nights a week
around midnight, waiters roam the public areas and lounges with
upscale canapés and hors d’oeuvres such as fish tempura and roasted
garlic lemon chicken. At least once per cruise fleetwide, the line offers
what it calls Elegant Tea, an impressive event in which white-gloved
waiters serve tea, finger sandwiches, scones, and desserts from rolling
trolleys. The line’s 24-hour room service allows passengers to order off
the lunch and dinner menus during those hours.
Activities and entertainment
Like in so many other areas, Celebrity excels with its wide variety of
activities and entertainment. Its complimentary enrichment lectures 
are offered on all cruises. Up to four featured speakers/performers may
include caricature artists (on weeklong Caribbean and Bermuda sailings),
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
142

naturalists (on Alaska, Hawaii, and South America sailings), chefs from
well-regarded shoreside restaurants, and wine experts who offer onboard
seminars and tastings. From time to time, actors, politicians, and journal-
ists also sail aboard and hold talks. Other innovative activities include
the line’s Acupuncture at Sea program. On all cruises, doctors specializ-
ing in Oriental medicine give free talks on acupuncture and other holistic
health treatments and offer acupuncture and medicinal herbal treat-
ments (for a fee) for pain management, smoking cessation, weight loss,
stress management, and other ailments.
You can find more standard fare such as wine tastings, bingo, bridge, art
auctions, trivia games, arts and crafts, cooking demos, computer classes,
dancing lessons, and lots of great spa treatments.
With the exception of the Zenith, Celebrity’s ships each feature the
AquaSpa, a water-centered spa that’s the equal of anything else the
industry offers. They all have a thalassotherapy pool, a kind of giant
New Age hot tub where water jets hit different parts of your body as you
relax. Decorated beautifully — with a Japanese motif on the Century and
Galaxy, for example — the spas also offer some of the most innovative
spa treatments at sea. From a Hawaiian Four Hands massage (yes, two
therapists work on you at once) to Rasul (a medicinal mud and steam
bath treatment) or a frangipani body wrap, how could you resist?
Celebrity has partnered with fantasy circus troupe Cirque du Soleil. After
some tweaking over the past year or two, the Cirque performance is a
now a full-blown production one night per cruise on the Constellation
and Summit. It’s a fully themed evening highlighted by the impressive
performance Cirque is known for. Otherwise, Celebrity continues to offer
some nice, understated entertainment touches such as strolling a cap-
pella groups, harpists, and classical trios performing in various parts of
each ship.
The line also offers a taste of more standard entertainment fare, with
Broadway-style musical reviews; performances by magicians, comedi-
ans, and cabaret acts; and passenger talent shows. Head for the disco
one night, or skip out completely and retire to one of the many cozy
dark lounges for a quiet evening, among the best being the elegant and
plush Michael’s Club piano lounges.
For kids
The Millennium, Constellation, Infinity, and Summit are the best fit for
families, each with a well-stocked indoor and outdoor play area, though
every ship in the fleet has a playroom and all but the Zenith have teen
centers. Some supervised activities are offered year-round, though
during holidays and summers there’s more: complimentary activities 
are geared toward four age groups between the ages of 3 and 17. Group
babysitting and private in-cabin sitting are available for an hourly fee
nightly for ages 3 to 12.

Fleet facts
The oldest Celebrity ship, the Zenith, is a fine ship if you’re looking for
something smaller than average, but when the company moved into the
megaship business, it topped itself with the impressive Century, which
underwent a $55 million facelift in spring 2006, and then topped itself
again with the Galaxy and again with the Mercury. The line’s 91,000-ton,
French-built Millennium-class ships continue the trend (though occa-
sional problems with the ships’ propulsion systems have resulted in 
the ships being taken out of service for a week here and there to make
repairs). These vessels — the Millennium, Infinity, Summit, and
Constellation — are just plain stunning: comfortable, beautifully
designed, and full of lovely rooms and varied diversions, such as an
Internet center, a music library, and extensive high-fashion shopping
opportunities. The Infinity, Summit, and Constellation have a conserva-
tory complete with benches and orchids (the Millennium has a smaller
version) — a botanical garden at sea, a respite from the hustle and
bustle of daily sea life (though of course, the catch is, the elaborate silk
flower arrangements there are actually for sale).
In general, the cabins on Celebrity ships are all good-sized and deco-
rated nicely (though not as big as Carnival’s cabins, for example). All
cabins fleetwide (with the exception of the Zenith) have minifridges and
cotton robes for use during the cruise. The ships’ penthouse suites are
very large and quite pleasing on the eyes, and all suites reap the serv-
ices of a butler and other perks such as free champagne and the option
of booking a massage in your cabin.
Two 118,000-ton ships carrying 2,850 passengers are in the works for
Celebrity. Named Celebrity Solstice and Celebrity Equinox, the ships are
slated to debut in fall 2008 and summer 2009, respectively.
The small, 94-passenger Celebrity Xpedition sails year-round in the
Galapagos Islands, offering the Celebrity experiences in a smaller pack-
age: same cuisine, similar decor, and a high guest/staff ratio, but with an
experience totally oriented to the islands’ natural wonders. On board,
there are only two restaurants (a main dining room and an outdoor
buffet), plus two bars/lounges, a whirlpool tub rather than a pool, and a
small gym with sauna and steam room. Table 11-4 shows the current
fleet specifications.

costacruises.com
 Type of cruise: Resort, family, party
 Ship size/style: Megaships and modern midsize ships
The origins of Costa are in Italy, and even though the company is now
owned by Miami-based Carnival Corporation, its origins show in nearly
everything it offers, from food to entertainment to decorative elements
to the many Italian-speaking crewmembers. Onboard activities include
festive Roman toga parties on Caribbean sailings, carnival and circus
nights in Europe, and audience-participation shows with a distinctly
European flavor. The line doesn’t design its cruises strictly for an
American audience, and therein lies its charm.
As the number-one cruise line in Europe, Costa boasts a modern fleet
that just keeps getting bigger. Between summer 2003 and summer 2006 it
launched four new megaships — Costa Mediterranea and Costa Fortuna
in 2003, Costa Magica in 2004, and Costa Concordia in 2006 — and has a
fifth, Costa Serena, set to debut in Europe in spring 2007.
The cruises draw a good age mix, including honeymooners and families,
many of whom are attracted to the line’s atmosphere of festive fun. A
good number of Italian-Americans are among the clientele on Caribbean
sailings. On European sailings, Americans make up only about 20 percent
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 145

of the passenger mix, which is predominantly Italian but also includes
French, German, and British citizens, among others. That leads to some
looooooong strings of announcements, which sometimes need to be
repeated in five different languages. The European mix also means that
many passengers smoke like chimneys, though smoking is officially
banned in all main dining rooms and main showrooms on all vessels.

Dining
Costa’s food, oddly enough, is only average, though the line’s pastas 
and pizza are very tasty and plentiful and presented in an authentically
Italian style. On theme nights, staffers may dress as gondoliers and pres-
ent red roses to all the women. Aside from the main restaurants, alterna-
tive dining venues include reservations-only alternative restaurants
aboard most of the line’s vessels, offering Mediterranean dishes such as
rigatoni served with lobster and tomatoes, or grilled lamb chops (for a
cover charge of $23 per person). A Tuscan steakhouse menu is also
available. Other noshing includes pizza cafes and patisseries serving
espresso, chocolates, and pastries.
Activities and entertainment
More than anything else, Costa is known for its exuberant (and often
Italian-inspired) activities, with three nights per 7-night cruise given over
to Italian and Mediterranean themes. A cast of extremely energetic and
shockingly attractive activities coordinators (known as the “animation
staff”) keep the atmosphere hopping into the wee hours.
The Roman Bacchanal Toga Night ends with a hysterical show that’s half
slapstick vaudeville and half American Idol. After each act, Julius Caesar
and the audience decide whether to send the performers to the buffet 
or throw them to the lions. Yes, it’s Italian à la Disney, but if you down
enough Campari, it all sort of starts to work, and the next time your
Filipino cabin steward greets you with “Buongiorno!” you may find your-
self buongiorno-ing right back.
The Costa experience also includes an almost-daily Catholic mass at
each ship’s chapel. Those who worship at the temple of golf can attend a
Golf Academy at Sea program on Caribbean cruises, in which guests take
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
148

onboard clinics and private lessons with PGA pros, participate in putting
competitions, and play at some of the Caribbean’s best courses.
For kids
Costa’s kids’ programs aren’t as extensive as those available on other
lines such as Disney and Royal Caribbean, but how many lines offer kids
Italian language lessons? Each ship has a playroom and carries at least
two full-time youth counselors to supervise kids’ activities, which are
offered for ages 3 to 17 for two or three age groupings, depending on
demand. Group babysitting for ages 3 and up is available every night
from 9 to 11:30 p.m. at no cost, and from 11:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. if you
make arrangements in advance. No private, in-cabin babysitting is avail-
able. On Gala nights there’s a great complimentary Parents’ Night Out
program from 6 to 11:30 p.m. during which kids 3 and older (they must be
out of diapers) are entertained and given a special buffet or pizza party.
Figure 11-3: Costa Atlantica
Fleet facts
Costa Allegra began life as a freighter back in the 1960s and was com-
pletely transformed into a passenger cruiser in the 1990s, with a contem-
porary Italian look. Outside, she still maintains the profile of a tough,
classic working ship, albeit in bright cruise ship white. Ditto for Costa
Marina, another ’60s-vintage ship that was totally overhauled in the
’90s, by the same architect.
Costa Classica and sister-ship Costa Romantica are stylish vessels
built in the early 1990s, Classica with a modern, contemporary décor
and Romantica with a warmer, more woody look. Costa Europa was
extensively reconfigured and remodeled when she joined the Costa fleet.
Though she’s not very old in human-years, she has the solid feel of an
old ocean liner.
Costa Victoria ushered Costa into the megaship era back in 1996 and
remains a sleek and stylish ship, with bright interiors, a seven-story
atrium, and a dramatic four-story lounge that’s reminiscent of spaces
aboard the great old deco liners, albeit with a lot of chrome and glass. In
2004, 246 of her cabins were retrofitted with balconies. Megaship Costa
Atlantica (see Figure 11-3) was the first in the fleet built with a large
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 149

number of private verandas (nearly 65 percent of the ship’s outside
cabins). The vessel’s decks are named after films by the great director
Federico Fellini, and its Café Florian is modeled after the landmark 18th-
century Venetian cafe of the same name, with gilt moldings and intricate
wall and ceiling murals. Atlantica’s sister ship, Costa Mediterranea, has
a dance motif and a similarly bright, festive décor.
Recent sister megaships Costa Fortuna and Costa Magica are somewhat
like Carnival ships with an Italian slant. They’re the largest passenger
ships in Italian maritime history — or at least they were until the 112,000-
ton Costa Concordia debuted, just as this book was going to press.

Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
150

Just about everything Mickey’s gloved hand touches turns to gold, and
the company’s pair of elegant cruise ships is no exception. The Disney
Magic (see Figure 11-4) and Wonder manage to be both classic and ultra-
modern, designed to evoke the grand transatlantic liners but also
decked out in some great family features.
In creating the line, Disney (being Disney) tried to rewrite the book on
cruising and has succeeded with several of its innovations, which, by
the way, you pay 20 to 80 percent more for compared to many other big-
ship lines, according to Charlie Funk, co-owner of Just Cruisin’ Plus in
Nashville. But you get a lot for the higher price tag. The ships’ cabins are
larger than the industry average and are designed with families in mind
(most come with a bathroom divided into two separate compartments:
one for the toilet and another for the shower/bath). In the dining depart-
ment, guests can rotate among a set of cool themed restaurants. Unique
Disney-inspired entertainment, as you may expect, is among the best in
the industry and includes original Broadway-style shows, first-run films
(shown in a real movie theater), and even an occasional movie premiere
at sea (coinciding with the movie’s land opening). A stage show, The
Golden Mickeys, takes the audience through the history of Disney films
and animation in an Academy Award–type format. The line’s kids’ pro-
grams are the best at sea and include a nursery for babies and toddlers
as young as 3 months, awesome teen areas, and free supervised activi-
ties until midnight daily.
WOW! What else could parents and kids ask for? Of course enjoying all
this assumes you can appreciate The Mouse and all the wholesome
family values he stands for (the ships have no casino, for example). That
said, the company has successfully infused the ships and the experience
with a subtler dose of Disney iconography than you may expect. For
example, Mickey and his pals only make a few scheduled appearances
during the cruise, and the cool Art Deco– and Art Nouveau–inspired
design takes center stage (and not Mickey’s big ears).
The ships carry 1,754 passengers at the rate of two per cabin, but since
Disney is a family company and its ships were built expressly to carry
three, four, and five people in virtually every cabin, the ship could theo-
retically carry a whopping 3,325 passengers. About 1,000 kids and teens
are aboard any given sailing. Passengers are usually spread out around
the ship, so it doesn’t feel that crowded except for the often-packed kids
pool area and the cramped buffet restaurant.
If you want a taste of land and sea, you can easily combine Disney’s 3-
and 4-night cruises aboard Disney Wonder with a Disney theme park and
hotel package to create a weeklong combo vacation, with bus trans-
portation between the parks and port included.

Dining
Disney’s dining scheme is like no other. Guests rotate among three differ-
ent restaurants, each with a whimsical design theme that keeps the kids
(and parents) from getting bored. The Animator’s Palette restaurant is
the most entertaining, given the whole room changes colors throughout
the meal (it’s all magic, of course). Parrot Cay has a bright jungle theme,
while Lumiere’s (on Wonder) and Triton’s (on Magic) are the more ele-
gant venues. Of course, all the restaurants have great kids’ menus, and
friendly servers are used to catering to the kids.
If adults want a night out alone in a cozy, dimly lit venue, Palo’s is the
place ($10 per person). It serves tasty northern Italian food and gets
booked up fast, so make a reservation pronto when you first board.
Other noshing opps include a small and cramped buffet restaurant, open
for breakfast, lunch, and sometimes dinner.
The ships excel in the snack department, with the poolside Pluto’s Dog
House guaranteed to be a big hit. Who can argue with chicken tenders,
fries, burgers, nachos, bratwurst, and other quick snacks served from
lunch through the dinner hour. There’s also pizza, ice cream, 24-hour
room service, and a specialty coffee bar.
Free fountain soda. All other big-ship lines — Carnival, Royal Caribbean,
Norwegian, and so on — charge for them.
Activities and entertainment
Disney’s fresh, family-oriented take on entertainment and activities
includes, of course, plenty of Disney-inspired stuff. Broadway-style stage
shows in the well-equipped Walt Disney Theatre include various musical
medleys of Disney classics. Other options include audience-participation
game shows, karaoke, and themed after-dinner deck parties. There’s an
indoor movie theater and a new jumbo 336-square-foot screen up on deck
(on Magic only), plus activities during the day such as wine tastings, galley
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
152

tours, bingo, and informal lectures and seminars on all sorts of things,
from animation to nautical themes, Disney history, home entertaining, and
cooking. Talks from people involved with Disney’s Broadway, film, and tel-
evision productions are also often featured. You’ll find a gym and spa,
newly expanded on the Magic. The Pool Deck with its three pool areas
(one each for kids, families, and adults) is always bustling. In fact, on
sunny sea days, look out, the kids’ pool area feels like a sardine can.
Sure Disney caters to families, but you’d be surprised how many folks
without kids like the Disney experience, including honeymooners. To
offer them, and their parents, too, some kid-free down time, the ships
shave off an adults-only (18 and older) entertainment area at one end of
the ship. Here you can find a jazz bar, a dance club, and a combination
sports pub and karaoke bar. There’s also Palo’s restaurant and even an
adults-only pool area (though the occasional kid wanders through). The
gym and spa are also reserved for adults most of the time.
For kids
As you’d expect, the ships excel in this area. From three months on up,
children are catered to. Babies get their own nursery (for an hourly fee),
kids get two gigantic playrooms, and teens have a private complex all to
themselves. On the Magic, there’s even a new hang-out room for “tweens”
from ages 10 to 14. Complimentary supervised activities are offered until
midnight daily, with some 50 youth counselors running the show (many
more than the other lines offer). There is no private in-cabin babysitting.
Disney’s private island in the Bahamas, Castaway Cay, is included on
nearly all itineraries and is a cruise highlight. The ship docks right at the
island, so no riding shuttle boats back and forth from the ship. The kids’
area will have them squealing with delight over the barrels to crawl
through, the giant whale-dig site to explore, and more. Adults will fall 
in love with the adult beach area sequestered away at one end of the
island, complete with rustic bar and massage cabanas. For the whole
family, there are watersports and even bikes for rent.
Kids under 3 who travel as a third, fourth, or fifth passenger and share 
a cabin with two adults pay a total of $149 for a 3- or 4-night cruise and
$169 for a 7-night cruise.

Fleet facts
The two Disney ships are nearly identical. Both pay tribute to the classic
ocean liners with their deep blue hulls, twin smokestacks, and updated
classic décor — Art Deco on the Magic and lighter Art Nouveau on the
Wonder. Cabins are bigger than standard and have minifridges and an
abundance of storage space; the 82 suites are particularly plush.

Holland America (HAL) has been around for a loooooong time, in fact,
more than 130 years. Though its ships are as modern and high-tech as
any others in the business, the line has managed to hang on to more of
its seafaring history and tradition than any line today except Cunard.
Though the line has moved away from catering to a seniors-only crowd
and focused on attracting a broader market, the ships still offer an old-
world elegance for a mellow crowd. With a few exceptions (namely the
Zuiderdam and Oosterdam of the line’s newest Vista class), décor is
understated and the vibe is subdued. Lots of fresh flowers, seafaring
memorabilia, and Indonesian fabrics and woodcarving evoke Holland’s
relationship with its former colony. These classic touches, along with
moderate size of most ships, are quite refreshing in this age of shock 
’em glitz and over-the-top scale. New or old, big or small, the Holland
America vessels are exceedingly handsome, their navy-blue hulls are
well maintained, and the ships have excellent (and remarkably similar)
layouts that ease passenger movement.
At press time in spring of 2006, HAL was winding up a fleetwide $225-million
upgrade program it calls “Signature of Excellence.” All cabins now have
flat-panel plasma TVs and DVD players; extra thick and comfy bedding,
towels, and terry-cloth bathrobes; plus new massage showerheads,
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
154

lighted magnifying makeup mirrors, and salon-quality hair dryers. Suites
have new duvets, fully stocked minibars, and personalized stationery,
and all suite guests have access to 24-hour concierge service. In addition
to an expanded lecture series, each ship now sports a really cool demon-
stration kitchen where a Culinary Arts program offers interactive pro-
grams about food and wine. Fleetwide, there’s a neat Starbucky-like
Internet café and library, and impressively upgraded spas and facilities
for kids.
The line makes a conscious effort to appeal to single travelers, with a
guaranteed share program for nonsmoking singles (of the same sex).
Also, gentlemen hosts are brought on sailings of 14 days or more to
socialize with single female passengers who want company.

Dining
Cuisine has improved over the years, and is comparable to what you
may find on the other mainstream lines. The highlight of the dining
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 157

options is the ship’s formal restaurants, which are elegant two-story
affairs that offer four seatings and feature live music. Aside from stan-
dards such as broiled lobster tail, grilled salmon, and filet mignon, you
can find light options on the menu as well as vegetarian options (Matt,
our resident vegetarian, went gaga recently over the tofu stroganoff).
The Pinnacle Grill is an alternative restaurant that offers what the line
calls Pacific Northwest cuisine. Choices include crab cakes, salmon, 
wild mushroom ravioli, and premium beef cuts, all complemented with
regional wines. The cover charge here is $20 per person. On a recent
Noordam cruise, the service was top rate and the food was really good
(though desserts were a bit weak) — make reservations as early as pos-
sible when you board.
For the casual diner, all ships have attractive and well-stocked buffet
restaurants that are open nearly round-the-clock, including dinner
nightly. Pizza and ice-cream stations are open till late afternoon, a taco
bar is open during lunch, and a poolside grill serves hamburgers, hot
dogs, veggie and turkey burgers, and a special of the day, such as knock-
wurst or spicy Italian sausage.
Once per cruise there’s a fancy High Tea (a rarity these days); the other
days there’s a more casual tea service, and you can find free hot canapés
served in some of the bars/lounges during the cocktail hour (none of the
other mainstream lines do this). Room service is offered 24 hours a day.
There’s also a specialty coffee bar, a nightly spread of snacks in the
buffet restaurant around midnight, and one gala dessert buffet every
week featuring lots of chocolate things plus marzipan, creampuffs, and
other diet busters.
Activities and entertainment
Though there’s a greater variety of things to do than ever, Holland
America still attracts a mostly early-to-bed crowd. You can head to the
disco or enjoy after-dinner cocktails or a show, but don’t expect to be
joined by half the ship doing the same thing as you might on Royal
Caribbean, Norwegian, Carnival, or even Princess.
Even if most passengers aren’t partying into the wee hours, most sample
the ships’ varied roster of things to see and do. Production shows include
fairly lavish sets and choreography complete with lasers and fancy cos-
tumes (though we wag a finger at the line for not having a live orchestra
for these shows on the Vista-class ships, where we’re told there isn’t
enough space). There are also passenger and crew talent shows and live
music in various lounges. Activities are plentiful and may include dance
lessons, cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, bingo, ship tours, and
country-western and ’50s parties. There’s also some tomfoolery on the
Pool Deck, so head out there if goofy relay races make you laugh.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships

On 7-night Alaska cruises, Native artists demonstrate traditional arts
such as ivory and soapstone carving, basket weaving, and mask making
as part of the line’s Artists in Residence program, created under the aus-
pices of Anchorage’s Alaska Native Heritage Center. Another program
offered during visits to Glacier Bay brings a member of the Huna tribe
aboard to talk about the land, which the Huna have called home for cen-
turies. In Hawaii and Mexico, cultural dancers perform.
For kids
To make good on its pledge to cater to a wider audience, Holland
America lowered the age minimum of its Club HAL complimentary kids’
activities from 5 down to 3. When enough kids are on board (usually hol-
idays and summers), activities are offered for three age groups between
3 and 17. Though you rarely see more than 300 or 400 kids aboard any
ship, the new playrooms and cool indoor/outdoor teen centers are
pretty impressive for ships this size. Group babysitting is offered for an
hourly rate between 10 p.m. and midnight daily for the 3 to 12 set, plus
private in-cabin sitting is also available.
In the Caribbean, the line has its own private island, called Half Moon
Cay. It’s an awesome place for families, with a kids’ aqua park on the
beach (complete with slides and water canons), plus neat excursions 
for the family, from horseback riding to snorkeling with stingrays.
Especially useful if traveling with children, most cabins on all ships have
bathtubs (on other lines, typically only suites have tubs), and standard
cabins are among the largest in the mainstream segment.
Figure 11-5: Volendam
Fleet facts
The Statendam, Maasdam, Ryndam, and Veendam are attractive mid-
size ships built in the mid-1990s, just before the ultrajumbo ships were
launched. Though mellow by today’s in-your-face standards, they’re all-
around appealing ships and very open and spacious, with enhanced spa
and children’s facilities, Internet cafes, alternative dining restaurants,
and other perks.

The flagship Rotterdam VI is a bigger vessel, although the basic layout
of its public rooms is similar to that on the Statendam-class sisters. The
Volendam (see Figure 11-5) and Zaandam combine features of both the
Statendam-class and Rotterdam VI, with a bit more pizzazz thrown in to
appeal to a younger crowd. For example, the Zaandam’s music theme
includes a wacky mix of instruments on display, from a gigantic pipe
organ in the atrium to a collection of guitars autographed by Iggy Pop,
the Rolling Stones, and Queen, and a saxophone that President Clinton
played in Holland.
The Amsterdam is a sister ship to the Rotterdam VI and is the first ship
in the fleet with a high-tech, environmentally friendly propulsion system
that provides a smoother ride than the usual rumbling diesels. The
Prinsendam is the line’s smallest and oldest ship; it’s cozy, couples-
oriented, relatively elegant, and features big, fancy suites.
Holland America went mega in September of 2002, with its largest ship to
date: the 85,000-ton, 1,848-passenger Zuiderdam, which was later joined
by the virtually identical Oosterdam, Westerdam (the third ship in the
line’s history to have that name), and Noordam (the fourth HAL ship
with the name). These Vista-class ships are bigger, with more public
spaces (such as a dedicated disco, sports bar, and the fleet’s largest
spas), and in the case of the Zuiderdam, way way brighter.
Wheelchair-accessible tenders are available on all the ships.

MSC Cruises
6750 N. Andrews Ave., Fort Lauderdale, FL 33309; % 800-666-9333; www.msc
cruises.com
 Type of cruise: Resort
 Ship size/style: Modern midsize and megaships, with older midsize
ships in Europe
MSC Cruises is a relatively young cruise line, born back in 1990 as the
cruise arm of Mediterranean Shipping, the world’s second-largest con-
tainer-shipping company. It coasted along with little fanfare, operating
older midsize vessels until 2004, when it began spending money like a
drunken sailor, ordering a whole fleet of new ships and hiring a high-
profile U.S. management team bent on increasing its market share.
Like Costa, the line stresses its Italian roots, but in a less flashy, “Si, we’re
Italian; would you like some espresso?” kind of way. Unlike Costa, which
is all about activities, MSC’s “quiet ship” approach means there are few
announcements during the day, so you’re not subjected to an endless
stream of translations. In the Caribbean, announcements are made in two
languages, English and Italian. MSC’s Mediterranean itineraries tend to
carry 85 percent European and 15 percent North Americans and “other,”
but Caribbean itineraries are exactly reversed, with Americans dominat-
ing. Also at diametrically opposed poles is the issue of kids, with
European itineraries tending to carry a lot of them, but Caribbean ones
seeing very few. Passengers’ typical age range is mid-40s and up.
The ships that made up MSC’s fleet during its first decade are now
referred to as its “classic fleet,” while the four identical midsize vessels
it built or acquired in 2003/2004 (and the megaships it began launching
with 2006’s 89,600-ton Musica) comprise its modern fleet, which sails in
both the Mediterranean and Caribbean.
The identical, modern-midsize Lirica, Opera, Armonia, and Sinfonia appeal
to travelers who want a more traditional style of cruise, with more human-
scale ships, traditional dining rituals, few gimmicks, and lots of socializing.
Activities are fun and group-oriented, and the ships’ relatively modest
sizes mean staff may greet you by name after a day or two.
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 161

Orchestra, a mega-sister-ship to Musica, is set to debut in 2007. Meanwhile,
two 133,500-ton, 3,300-passenger super-megas named Fantasia and
Serenata are scheduled to debut in June 2008 and March 2009. Other plans
in MSC’s future include deployment of one of its new megaships in the
Caribbean and the start of year-round cruises from New York, though no
schedule had been set at press time.

Dining
Dining service is traditional, with a very European sensibility — which
means courteous and professional rather than U.S.-style “Hey every-
body, my name’s George!” overfriendly. Both service and menus have
improved in the past couple of years, after the line began making its big
push on the U.S. market.
On MSC’s “modern fleet,” two formal dining rooms serve open-seating
breakfast and lunch and a traditional dinner in two fixed seatings, with
an emphasis on Italian cuisine. An Italian regional specialty is featured
every night, with descriptive menu information. Casual dining is also
available in the buffet restaurant at breakfast and lunch. There’s a stan-
dard grill on the Pool Deck during the day, and Italian specialty snacks
are available at night. At the witching hour, the line offers one of the few
daily midnight buffets left in the industry.
Activities and entertainment
Activities, led by a young “animation team,” tend toward the traditional,
many of them with a European sense of fun. During the day, expect games
by the pool (including water polo and treasure hunts), dance lessons, and
an occasional informal lecture in one of the lounges. At night, stage shows
range from ho-hum production numbers to pretty interesting segments
that draw on European circus traditions, featuring contortionists, acro-
bats, and stilt performers. Special shows may also feature operatic
soloists or magicians. Elsewhere, the animation team leads participatory
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 163

games in a lounge, while music, dancing, casino gambling, and piano bar
entertainment are available around the ships.
For kids
Each one of the “modern fleet” ship has a cute (though smallish) chil-
dren’s center, while other kid-centric activities around the ship may
include “baby disco” and balloon-tying shows. In the Caribbean, private
in-cabin babysitting can be arranged through the main desk for $15 an
hour.
Figure 11-6: MSC Opera
Fleet facts
While MSC’s U.S. sales office markets all its ships to Americans, the
emphasis is definitely on the “modern fleet”: sister ships Opera, Lirica,
Sinfonia, and Armonia and the new megaship Musica.
The sister ships Lirica and Opera (see Figure 11-6), which currently sail
the line’s North American itineraries, are straightforward midsize ves-
sels without any bizarre attractions or gimmicks — no planetariums,
rock-climbing walls, or mythological design schemes. Expect to spend
your days exploring the ports and then getting together in the various
lounges at night to talk and relax in a quiet environment. Long and low,
both vessels seem a lot larger than they really are. Cabins are adequate
if small; cabin showers are downright tiny.
Another pair of sister ships, Armonia and Sinfonia, are almost identi-
cal to Lirica and Opera, having been designed and built by the same
French shipyard. Both from a distance and while on board, you can
hardly tell the difference between them. MSC acquired both from
Festival/First European cruises after that company’s bankruptcy.
MSC’s so-called “classic fleet” is made up of vessels that have been
around for a while, and are mostly marketed to Europeans. Fans of clas-
sic liners may enjoy them, though. Melody is most familiar to American
audiences, having sailed for years as the Big Red Boat Atlantica for now-
defunct Premier Cruises. Rhapsody sailed as Cunard’s Cunard Princess
until 1995. Monterey is by far the oldest ship in the fleet, having
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
164

launched in 1952 and gone through several owners before landing with
MSC in the early 1990s.
MSC’s new 2,550-passenger, 89,600-ton Musica marries MSC’s quiet, old-
fashioned approach to cruising with the amenities of a modern mega-
ship, including a three-deck waterfall in the atrium, a three-deck main
theater, a variety of restaurants (including a sushi bar and panoramic
garden-themed restaurant), a huge casino, a “well-being” bar in the spa,
and balconies on 65 percent of all cabins.
Orchestra, a sister-ship to Musica, is slated to launch in 2007.

 Type of cruise: Resort, family, party
 Ship size/style: Megaships, modern and older midsize ships
Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) is mainstream straight down the line, offer-
ing big, colorful ships with lots of dining options, lots of entertainment,
and lots of fun. It’s the go-to line for Hawaii cruises (it has the market
almost all to itself) and for a totally casual cruise experience, 24/7.
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 165

NCL moved into the megaship age in 1999 with Norwegian Sky, and all
the ships it’s built since are standouts, giving Royal Caribbean and
Princess a run for their money. Since being bought by Star Cruises of
Malaysia in 2000, the line has been one of the most innovative players in
the cruise biz. The “Freestyle Cruising” concept it introduced in 2000
broke with cruise ship tradition to offer a more casual experience, with
open-seating dining (dine when you want, where you want) and a resort-
casual dress code (though an occasional optional formal night is thrown
in for good measure). The idea was to shake off the stuffiness of tradi-
tional cruising and make the experience more like a land-based resort
vacation. The experiment worked, because stuffy it ain’t: For proof, look
no further than the bright paintings that adorn the white hulls of the
line’s newer vessels, and the generally colorful and playful design
schemes throughout.
NCL’s Freestyle concept extends all the way through your cruise. For
example, if you’re not in a hurry to leave on the last day, the ships offer
Freestyle debarkation, giving you time to have a leisurely breakfast and
disembark up until about 10 a.m., rather than hustling off early as is
required by most lines.
NCL was also an innovator with its “Homeland Cruising” concept,
berthing vessels in homeports up and down the U.S. seaboards and 
thus letting more people drive to their ship rather than fly. In maybe 
its biggest innovation, the line reversed a decades-long trend in the U.S.
cruise industry by registering and staffing some of its ships in the United
States, a move that brought considerable additional costs (taxes and
payrolls for U.S. workers are higher than those overseas) but also made
them the only large cruise ships in compliance with U.S. cabotage laws,
which forbid foreign-flagged and -staffed ships from sailing itineraries
composed solely of U.S. ports. What’s that mean in English? It means
NCL’s Pride of Aloha, Pride of America, and Pride of Hawai’i (see Figure 11-7)
are the only large cruise ships — period — that can offer all-Hawaii itin-
eraries from a homeport in Honolulu. Anyone else who sails Hawaii has
to either set off from a Mexican homeport or include the islands on a
longer cruise that also visits foreign ports, options that entail many days
at sea.
Fleetwide, NCL’s onboard atmosphere is informal, upbeat, and well
suited to casual types, party-makers, families, and first-time cruisers.
The line attracts a lot of passengers under 50 (slightly older in Europe)
and a good many families with kids, especially during summers and holi-
days. Passengers in general are price-conscious and more active than
those aboard lines such as Holland America, Celebrity, and Princess.
Service is consistently speedy and efficient in the cabin-service, room-
service, and bar departments.

Dining
Know how, on dry land, there are those little restaurants with only a few
tables and a short menu that is just to die for — and down the road are
those huge gilded-palace restaurants with the menu that goes on forever,
but the food is more average? NCL’s dining experience is more like the
latter: There’s a lot of it, and it’s generally pretty good, but it just isn’t
gourmet. There are, of course, exceptions. The French and Continental
food at the Le Bistro specialty restaurant? Yum. Those Indian spreads
they sometimes put out in the buffet? Double-yum.
You sure can’t fault them for variety, though: The latest generations 
of NCL ships have ten different restaurants on board, including Italian,
Asian, sushi, French, steakhouse, and Tex-Mex, plus snack and sandwich
options, ice-cream parlors, and an occasional chocoholic buffet. On
Pride of America, for instance, you can dine at the two main restaurants
(the Art-Deco Skyline Restaurant and the Liberty Restaurant, which
looks like an old-time political rally), or choose among several intimate,
extra-cost dinner options: the Lazy J Texas Steakhouse, where waiters
serve in cowboy hats; Jefferson’s Bistro, an elegant venue modeled after
the third president’s Monticello home and serving French cuisine; and
East Meets West, a pan-Asian restaurant with attached sushi/sashimi bar
and teppanyaki room. For off-hours noshing, the Cadillac Diner serves
burgers, shakes, and other diner fare 24 hours.
All the restaurants on all NCL ships follow an open-seating policy each
and every evening, allowing you to dine whenever you like within the
5:30 to 10 p.m. window, dressed however you like (within limits), and sit-
ting with whomever you want rather than having a table and dining com-
panions preassigned.
The night of the captain’s cocktail party is officially an “optional formal”
night, giving folks who like to dress up a chance to shine. If you prefer,
you can just don the slacks and polo, of course. Your choice.
As aboard most lines, the smaller, finer restaurants carry a cover charge
that ranges from $12 to $20 per person. Dining service is about what you
find on the other mainstream lines — generally good, with occasional
forgivable lapses.
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 169

Activities and entertainment
High-energy folks, take note: You always have something to do aboard
NCL’s activity-packed ships. You can take dance lessons; sit in on a cook-
ing demo, beauty seminar, or talent show; play bingo, shuffleboard, or
basketball; attend an art auction or wine tasting (the latter for $15 per
person); and on some cruises, sit in on enrichment lectures.
All the ships feature spas offering Eastern- and Western-influenced treat-
ments, with the spa facilities on the newest ships really standing out in
the style department. All the vessels also offer sports bars with ESPN cov-
erage of games, and extensive sports and fitness facilities, including full-
size basketball courts. Gyms fleetwide are open 24 hours, with stretching,
step, aerobics, and other traditional classes offered free and spinning,
kickboxing, Pilates, yoga, and other trendy choices costing an extra $10. In
Hawaii, the line offers golf excursions to some of the islands’ best courses.
NCL offers some of the best entertainment among the mainstream 
lines, including excellent and surprisingly inventive Vegas-style musical
revues, musical soloists, comedians, and more. On Norwegian Dawn and
Norwegian Jewel, members of the famed Second City comedy troupe 
perform hysterical sketch comedy shows and lead seminars in improv
comedy for passengers. On the Hawaii ships, one night a week is devoted
to Polynesian music and dance.
Production shows are way above average too, with talented performers
and good choreography, costumes, and set design. Ditto for most of the
musicians and other performers, from the always-awesome NCL singer
Jane L. Powell and her band to the pianists and comedians who play the
ships’ lounge circuit.
Gamblers take note: Because of Hawaiian law, Pride of Aloha, Pride of
America, and Pride of Hawai’i do not have casinos aboard, nor any other
kind of gambling.
For kids
NCL’s Kids Crew program offers year-round supervised activities for kids
2 to 17, divided into four age groups. Activities for younger kids include
treasure hunts, face painting, magic shows, arts and crafts, sports com-
petitions, dances, and cooking classes. Each ship has a playroom, but
those on the Dawn, Star, Jewel, Spirit, Sun, Pride of America, and Pride of
Hawai’i are the best by far, huge spaces that include a large, well-stocked
playroom and a separate teen center. Dawn, Spirit, and Star also have
wonderful outdoor play areas with wading pools, hot tubs, and a fun
theme — dinosaurs on Dawn, rockets on Star, and pirates on Spirit. Jewel
has a much smaller outdoor pool with a sea creatures theme.
On sea days, kids programs are offered from 9 a.m. to noon, 2 to 5 p.m.,
and then 7 to 10 p.m.; on port days hours are from 7 to 10 p.m., with
group sitting offered 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for a small fee. Port program times

are sometimes adjusted to accommodate parents’ on shore excursions.
Private babysitting is not available.
Kids under age 2 travel free.

Fleet facts
NCL’s fleet divides pretty nicely into three groups: the U.S.-flagged NCL
America ships, the foreign-flagged megaships, and the 1980s- and 1990s-
vintage midsize ships.
The NCL America fleet has three ships. Pride of Aloha was originally
born as NCL’s first megaship, Norwegian Sky. In 2001, she went in for a
top-to-toe refit that turned her into the first of the line’s all-Hawaii, all-
the-time ships. Interiors were Hawaiianized with bright floral colors,
Hawaiian artwork, and references to Hawaiian culture and history, from
orchids to outrigger canoes, beaches, fish, waterfalls, colonial planta-
tions, surfing, and famous figures who traveled there. Few traces of
Norwegian Sky remain except (unfortunately) for her tiny cabins. Oh,
well. Otherwise she’s great.
Pride of America is as all-American as her name, with an all-U.S. crew
and decorative motifs that range from the Great Seal of the United States
(on the marble floor of the Capitol Atrium reception area) to huge
photos of the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, the Golden Gate Bridge,
the Chicago Skyline, and other American landmarks in the stair towers.
Nice in moderation, but the U.S.A. imagery is a bit overwhelming, and
sometimes veers a little too close to theme park kitschiness. Overall,
though, America has a lively atmosphere, a mix of classy and fun spaces,
great kids’ facilities, some fun toys (including a trampoline with bungee
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 171

harness to keep you from flying over the side, and a “spaceball chal-
lenger” gyroscope in which passengers can revolve 360 degrees in any
direction, like astronauts in outer space), and more than enough restau-
rant and entertainment options to keep things interesting. Cabins tend
to be on the small side. Insides are only 132 square feet, while standard
outsides (without balconies) max out at 144. Storage space is limited,
but bathrooms are adequately sized.
The line’s newest Hawaii ship, Pride of Hawai’i, is NCL’s most success-
ful vessel to date, the apotheosis of everything the company has been
working toward for the past decade. Essentially a brighter, Hawaiianized,
U.S. crewed sister-ship to Norwegian Jewel (see below), she’s stylish,
comfortable, and above all fun, and is definitely the megaship of choice
in the Hawaii market. Like the other recent NCL ships, she has ten
restaurants (two mains, plus a steakhouse, French restaurant, Asian
restaurant, Italian restaurant, Tex Mex/tapas, cafe, buffet, and grill), plus
a great beer-and-whiskey bar (the best at sea, along with Jewel’s), a fun
show lounge with private karaoke rooms off to one side, a lively pool
deck, a huge gym and spa, and the largest suites in the cruise industry.
NCL’s other megaships, the foreign-flagged Norwegian Spirit, Norwegian
Star, Norwegian Dawn, and Norwegian Jewel, are real knockouts, offer-
ing between eight and ten different restaurants apiece, elegant spaces
such as Gatsby’s Champagne Bar (on Dawn); fun ones like an outdoor 
Bier Garten (on Spirit and Star); the best beer and whiskey bar at sea
today (on Jewel); large, fanciful observation lounge/discos; great spas;
huge and completely kid-centric playrooms; and Kid’s Cafés in the buffet
restaurants (complete with tiny chairs and a miniature buffet counter).
Norwegian Spirit is slightly smaller than her sisters and has a slightly dif-
ferent layout. Two sister ships of Norwegian Jewel, dubbed Norwegian
Pearl and Norwegian Gem, are scheduled to enter service in February 2007
and October 2007 respectively.
Norwegian Sun was NCL’s second megaship after Norwegian Sky, and
blazed the trail that the later ships followed, with 9 restaurants, 12 bars,
and everything designed with casual cruising in mind.
Norwegian Crown, Norwegian Majesty, and sister ships Norwegian
Dream and Norwegian Wind are from the late ’80s and early ’90s. The
clock’s ticking on them, with plans in place to transfer them to NCL’s
Asian parent company, Star Cruises, over the next few years. They’re not
the most modern kids on the block, and they have some pretty small
cabins, but they do have their charming spots. Dream and Wind, for
example, have great sports bars with giant-screen TVs.

 Type of cruise: Premium, country-club casual, gourmet
 Ship size/style: Mini-midsize, low-key casual
Oceania stands out with its calm, casual onboard atmosphere, superb
dining, and long, interesting itineraries. All three of its ships sport a
lovely sort of British hotel look: very traditional in their public areas and
comfy in the cabins, with little or no glitz. On board, the vibe is floating
country club: totally low-key, with few organized activities, small-scale
entertainment, an always-casual dress code, and outrageously comfort-
able cabin beds. Despite such luxe-travel touches, you can still get
Oceania’s cruises on the cheap, at prices that are frequently in the same
ballpark as the larger mainstream lines. Combine those low prices with
the ships’ smallish size and overall quality and you have a cruise line
that doesn’t fit comfortably in any of the regular cruise niches. Maybe
the closest we can come is to say it’s like a younger, less polished ver-
sion of luxe line Regent Seven Seas.
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 173

On board, service balances precision with friendliness, and is close to
the kind of understated professionalism you see on the real luxury lines.
Because of the relatively small number of passengers, it’s also more per-
sonal than you find aboard the megaships. Stewards greet you by name,
and bartenders remember your favorite drink after the first day.
Passengers tend to be older and want a quiet vessel where they can
entertain themselves, enjoy the ports, and linger over dinner. Couples in
their mid-40s who want that kind of experience wouldn’t be out of place
on board, but party types would, as would kids — this isn’t a line tai-
lored to families. It’s also not a line tailored to smokers, with smoking
prohibited everywhere except two small patches of the Pool Deck and
the nightclub.
Oceania offers frequent two-for-one deals and often bundles airfare into
their rates. Check the line’s Web site for details.

Dining
Dining is one of Oceania’s best features, with menus created by renowned
chef Jacques Pepin, four dinner venues with reliably enjoyable atmos-
phere and flavor, and an always casual, dress-as-you-want, dine-when-
you-want (within a three-hour window) format.
The Grand Dining Room, the main restaurant on each ship, serves five-
course, French-inspired meals, with tables for two, four, and more. A
string quartet provides music at dinner. Main courses may include faves
such as lobster tail butterfly or beef Wellington, or surprises such as
sautéed sea bream filet and pheasant breast ballotine stuffed with morel
mushrooms. In each ship’s stern are two alternative restaurants: Toscana
for Mediterranean-style cuisine and the Polo Grill for steakhouse fare.
Both offer décor and ambience appropriate to their menus, as well as
great views of the ship’s wake — very beautiful at sunset. The same can
be said, only more so, for the Terrace Cafe. During the day it’s just an out-
door seating area for the indoor buffet, but at night its tables are set with
linens and hurricane-lamp candles. Regional Spanish and Mediterranean
specialties are the fare, along with other ethnic dishes and home-style
favorites.
Activities and entertainment
Don’t book this line looking for a lot of guided play, though the ships do
program a light menu of enrichment lectures (often themed around the
sailing region), fitness and computer classes, karaoke, health and beauty
seminars led by the spa and salon staff, plus games such as bingo and
shuffleboard. The casino is nicely sized and has slots, blackjack, and
roulette. Spa services (all the usual) and fitness equipment (plenty of
variety and quantity to go with a good schedule of organized fitness 
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 175

programs) are available in nice rooms, with the outside spa pool and
seating area providing a nice touch.
For major relaxation, you can rent one of eight private cabanas up on
Deck 11, each with privacy partitions and white drapes, great sea views, a
retractable shade roof, and a plush day bed built for two. They’re avail-
able either daily ($50 on port days, $100 on sea days) or for the entirety
of your cruise, and come with the services of an attendant who provides
food and beverage service, chilled towels, and water spritzes. Guests can
even arrange to get massages and other spa treatments in their cabana.
On the entertainment front, the line can boast really good music, with 
a 12-piece jazz band performing afternoons and evenings and quality
pianists playing standards in the martini bar before dinner. Other enter-
tainment includes low-key shows in the main lounge: classical pianists,
magicians, and sometimes music and dance performances by local
groups brought aboard for the evening.
For kids
There are no special kids’ facilities on these ships, since there are rarely
any kids aboard.
Figure 11-8: Regatta
Fleet facts
Oceania lucked out with its ships. All three were built for now-defunct
Renaissance Cruises — Regatta (see Figure 11-8) and Insignia in 1998,
Nautica in 2000 — and were still almost brand-new when Oceania got
hold of them not long after. A bit of refurbishment got them up to speed
for the kind of cruises the new line planned to offer. These are comfort-
able and spacious ships decorated mostly in warm, dark woods and rich
fabrics. They’re traditional and sedate, with an emphasis on intimate
spaces rather than the grand, splashy ones on most megaships.
Décor throughout stresses dark wood-grain paneling, fluted columns,
ornate faux-iron railings, gilt-framed paintings, Oriental-style carpets, and
deep-hued upholstery. In the bow, the spacious, woody Horizons lounge
has floor-to-ceiling windows and brass telescopes. It’s used for dancing in
the evening and for high tea and other functions in the afternoon. Evening
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
176

entertainment is presented in a club-style 345-seat show lounge with lots
of comfy tables for four. A smallish but comfortable casino offers black-
jack, poker tables, roulette, and slots, while the next-door Martini Bar is
probably our favorite space on board, with a gentlemen’s-club décor, a
long martini menu, and jazz and standards in the evening. The ships’
libraries are some of the loveliest at sea, with comfy seating, excellent
lighting, and marble fireplace.
Cabins are straightforward spaces with a hint of modern European hotel:
plain off-white walls, dark wood trim and furniture, and rich carpeting.
Of the 342 staterooms, 280 are essentially the same size (150–165 sq. ft.),
and of those, 170 have balconies. Bathrooms are small, though they pro-
vide enough shelf and counter space, plus adequate amenities.
The best thing about the cabins are the beds, which Oceania calls
“Tranquility Beds” for good reason. Each is delightfully firm and fitted
with 350-thread-count Egyptian linens, a plush comforter/silk-cut duvet,
and probably the best fluffy down pillows we’ve ever used. We’d love to
get hold of a couple. Wonder if they’ll fit in our suitcases?
New in 2006 was The Patio, a shaded outdoor lounge located in the aft
port corner of the pool deck, furnished with thickly cushioned sofas,
chairs, and day beds. Drapes and general ambience add shade and some
separation from the pool goings-on.

This line gets an A for its all-around appeal, which is more mellow than
Carnival, NCL, or Royal Caribbean and less mellow than Holland
America. The line has great family facilities, yet you won’t find a thou-
sand kids aboard like on some other lines. Princess straddles a middle
ground in just about everything it does, an approach that works just fine
for many people. You can chill out with a book in the library, join a
bridge tournament, or head for the Pool Deck or disco for more action.
You can play miniature golf aboard many ships or take a spin in the pottery-
making studio. The line excels in the dining department too, with many
options and flexible timings. Though Princess has some of the industry’s
largest ships, they’ve been designed well so that passengers are spread
out and the vessels rarely feel as large as they really are (for example,
the line favors multiple one-story dining rooms as opposed to giant two-
and three-story affairs).
For loyal customers, the line’s Captain’s Circle program issues specially
colored onboard keycards and cabin-door nameplates (gold after taking
1 to 5 cruises, platinum after 5, and elite after 15) so staffers know to be
extra helpful. Platinum Captain’s Circle members also get expedited
embarkation and free Internet access throughout their cruise. Elite mem-
bers receive free laundry and dry-cleaning services, a complimentary
wine-tasting class, 10 percent off in the onboard gift shops, and more.
Though Princess offers worldwide itineraries, it’s been particularly
strong in Alaska for decades. Through its affiliate, Princess Tours, it
offers more than 20 different cruisetour itineraries in conjunction with
its Gulf of Alaska and Inside Passage voyages, visiting Denali National
Park, Fairbanks, the Kenai Peninsula, Wrangell–St. Elias National Park,
Canada’s Yukon Territory, and distant Prudhoe Bay on Alaska’s north
coast. Guests on land tours stay in five Princess-owned wilderness
lodges and travel via motor coach and the line’s domed Midnight
Express train cars. Table 11-17 shows more Princess itineraries, as 
well as sample fares.

Dining
Princess’s food is typically tasty, though not particularly memorable.
What registers instead is the dining system. The line’s Personal Choice
Dining program allows passengers two options: dining at a set time with
set dining companions in one of the ship’s two or three main restaurants,
or just wandering into a different restaurant at any time during a 41⁄2-hour
window to be seated by the maitre d’. No matter how you choose to dine,
you can always find healthy choices, vegetarian options, and a kids’ menu.
If you’re not sure which option you may prefer once you’re on board,
sign up for traditional, because it’s easier to switch to anytime dining
than it is to go the other way ’round.
Fleetwide, you can also find a buffet restaurant operating around the
clock (including full sit-down meals until 4 a.m.), as well as smaller, more
intimate alternative restaurants, including an Italian trattoria and steak-
house restaurant on the Grand- and Diamond-class ships (as well as the
Pacific, Royal, and Tahitian Princess); trattoria and New Orleans–style
restaurants on Coral and Island Princess; and a steakhouse and free sit-
down pizzeria on the Sun-class ships. The Regal offers a sit-down pizzeria
only. Prices are $20 per person at the trattoria and $15 at the steakhouse.
Reservations are recommended.
Unlike the no-dress-code dress code that’s part of Norwegian’s “Freestyle”
dining plan, Princess maintains the tradition of holding two formal nights
per week, with the other nights designated smart casual (khakis and polo
or button-down shirt are fine for men; ladies, you know what to do).
In the snack department, aside from 24-hour room service, there’s a spe-
cialty coffee bar, a poolside grill doling out burgers and pizza, and an ice-
cream bar serving Häagen-Dazs and Princess’s house brand for a charge
(but no free ice cream or frozen yogurt like most ships offer).
You can order room service and eat out on your balcony anytime you
choose, but if you want to be served by a waiter and eat something more
interesting than a turkey sandwich or pizza, just cough up $50 per person
and bon appetite! Aboard the Grand-class ships, you can have a table set
up on your balcony with a tablecloth, hurricane candle lamp, and cham-
pagne. While the waiter is setting everything up, you and your better half
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 181

can have a complimentary cocktail in one of the ship’s bars. On all the
ships, you can order a fancy breakfast served on the balcony for $25 per
couple.
Activities and entertainment
A wide variety of activities include miniature golf, virtual golf, and 
basketball/volleyball, all available on the Grand-, Coral-, and Diamond-
class ships. The Grand-class ships also have gigantic virtual/video game
rooms, while the Caribbean, Grand (see Figure 11-9), Sea, and Crown
Princess have giant LED movie screens on deck showing movies, sport-
ing events, and other popular shows. Plus, aside from standards such 
as bingo, dancing lessons, and poolside bellyflop contests, in the
Caribbean, guests can earn PADI scuba-diving certification while on
board. A fleetwide enrichment program, called ScholarShip@Sea, offers
classes in cooking, computer skills, finance, photography, and pottery
making. Large-group seminars are free, while small-group and individual
classes, unfortunately, carry a charge of around $20 to $25 per person.
Charges for paint-your-own ceramics are calculated based on the piece
you create. When it comes to evening entertainment, the choices include
the standard Vegas-style song and dance revues, plus comedy routines,
live music, and more innovative stuff such as the American Idol–style
“Princess Idol” competition.
In Alaska, rangers, naturalists, and guest lecturers present talks and
slide shows on such topics as the Iditarod sled-dog race, the wildlife and
ecology of Glacier Bay and the Tongass National Forest, oceanography
and marine life, glaciers, Native Alaskan cultures, and Alaskan history.
You can book your spa appointments online before your cruise if you’re
sailing on the Caribbean Princess or Sapphire Princess — a real boon con-
sidering how long the lines can be when you have to sign up for a mas-
sage on board.
Want the big boss to tie your knot? Princess is the only line where the cap-
tain himself conducts legal weddings aboard ship. The ceremonies take
place aboard the Grand-, Diamond-, and Coral-class ships, all of which
have wedding chapels on board. (Other lines have wedding chapels, too,
but the captain is nowhere to be seen.) Book yours far in advance; the
captain doesn’t have time to do more than a handful per cruise.
For kids
The Grand-, Diamond- and Coral-class ships all have great indoor/outdoor
facilities and complimentary supervised activities, including some great
educational ones, for ages 3 to 17. Group babysitting is offered nightly at
an hourly rate between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. Learning activities may
include environmental education programs developed by the California
Science Center, the California Coastal Commission, and the Center for
Marine Conservation, which teach kids about oceans and marine life
through printed materials and films. The kids’ equivalent of an onboard
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
182

guest lecturers program is also offered occasionally, allowing children to
go stargazing with an astronomer, work on their drawing with an anima-
tor, and so on.
Figure 11-9: Grand Princess
Fleet facts
Princess offers one of the most consistent fleets in the business —
mostly megaships built in the past decade, many on very similar
designs.
The line’s Sun-class ships (Dawn, Sun, and Sea Princess) led the way in
the 1990s toward the design Princess has used ever since. They’re pretty
vessels, with a décor that mixes classic and modern, using materials such
as varnished hardwoods, marble, etched glass, granite, and textured fab-
rics. It’s a comfortable and quiet look, with light color schemes and wood
tones predominating. The ships’ layout are very easy to navigate.
The Grand-class ships (Grand, Golden, Star, Caribbean, and Crown) came
next, beginning with Grand Princess in 1998. At the time it was the largest
passenger ship ever, though it lost its title quickly to Royal Caribbean’s
Voyager-class vessels. Still, these are massive ships, with 18 decks soaring
up to their space-age discos, which hover in the air at their very stern,
stretching from port to starboard and resembling the handle on a giant
shopping cart. The ships look like nothing else at sea, and though they
look huge from the outside, they’re extremely well laid out inside, and sur-
prisingly cozy. Though ultramodern, they also manage to offer a few areas
with traditional accents that recall the old steamship days, including the
clubby and dimly lit Explorer’s and Wheelhouse lounges. Caribbean and
Crown Princess, which launched in 2004 and 2006, respectively, are slightly
larger versions of the Grand-class concept, with a similar layout but one
extra deck, plus a giant outdoor screen and a cafe serving Caribbean
dishes. A sixth sister, named Emerald Princess, is scheduled to debut in
spring 2007.
Coral Princess and Island Princess are smaller cousins to the Grand
ships, built to be able to just about squeeze through the Panama Canal —
something the Grands can’t do. They’re some of the loveliest vessels to
debut since the turn of the century, with beautiful exterior lines and a
well laid-out interior, with balconies on some 83 percent of their outside
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 183

cabins. Their understated interiors are both classic and modern, with
Internet centers and Times Square–style news tickers right around the
corner from woody, almost Edwardian lounges.
Diamond and Sapphire Princess are even better. Built by Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries in Nagasaki, Japan, these two vessels are Princess’s
biggest and best ever, more sleek, graceful, and streamlined than 
the Grand-class ships, with many of the features that make Coral and
Island great: comfortable cabins, woody lounges with hints of seagoing
history, understated central atrium lobbies, relaxing indoor/outdoor
“Conservatory” pool areas, large Asian-themed spas, and covered
Promenade decks that wrap around the bow, just below the open top
deck. Their stern decks are stunning, with four decks descending in
curved, horseshoe tiers, creating a multilevel resort with two pools, 
two hot tubs, two bars, and a magnificent view of the ship’s wake.
Designed by Renzo Piano, the architect who did the Centre Pompidou 
in Paris, the Regal Princess is the line’s oldest and one of its smallest
ships. The 30,277-ton Tahitian Princess, Pacific Princess, and Royal
Princess are all former Renaissance Cruises vessels, sailing more wide-
ranging itineraries that concentrate on Asia, the South Pacific, Hawaii,
the Mediterranean, Israel, and the Black Sea.

 Type of cruise: Resort, family, party
 Ship size/style: Megaships, and some really huge ones at that
Some cruise lines really push the envelope. Meet Royal Caribbean (RCI).
In spring of 2006, the line introduced the amazingly gigantic Freedom of
the Seas, topping its five Voyager-class ships, which made their own
headlines a few years back for offering ice-skating rinks and rock-climbing
walls. Pshaw! Freedom has all that stuff plus a huge water park, a real
professional-sized boxing ring, and giant hot tubs that hang out over the
side of the ship. What the heck happened to bingo and napkin folding?
The line is one of our top mainstream picks (especially for the Freedom-,
Voyager-, and Radiance-class ships, which among other things have
some of the industry’s best spas), and is a top choice for both families
and party people.
RCI offers a more youthful, energetic product than a lot of other cruise
lines, delivering fun, humor, a touch of class, and a bit of “feel the burn”
active excitement, all at reasonable mainstream prices. Passengers range
from ages 20- and 30-something on up, with most hailing from the U.S., a
chunk from Canada, and a smaller chunk from elsewhere, especially Latin
America and Asia. Though they’re looking for good times, they’re more
karaoke than kamikaze shot (though shorter 3- and 4-night cruises from
Miami and Los Angeles tend to attract a more partying crowd).
Royal Caribbean doesn’t accept booking from travelers under 21 unless
they’re sharing a room with an adult over 25. Exceptions are made for
young married couples and for families who book connecting cabins so
that the kids can have their own.
The ships are well run and the product consistent, with armies of well-
trained staff to keep things running efficiently — no small feat on ships
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 185

this large. Dining, bar, and cabin service is all surprisingly good given
the sheer number of passengers crewmembers must deal with.
Fleetwide, the décor skews toward contemporary, with some nautical
touches on the newer Radiance-class ships and some leftover chrome
and ’80s/’90s glitz on the older ships. All told, though, the RCI ships are a
lot calmer in the ornamentation department than, say, Carnival and
Costa. Many public areas are outstanding, including elaborate health
clubs, spas, relaxing Solarium pools, huge theaters and smaller show
lounges, enormous boulevard-like atriums on the Voyager ships, and the
trademark Viking Crown Lounges, which sit atop the ships like airport
control towers. While the big new vessels get all the press, RCI hasn’t
forgotten its older ships, spending millions to retrofit them with features
that were developed for the more recent vessels.

Dining
Royal Caribbean’s cuisine falls in the “pretty tasty” range, with a lot of
options (though not as many as at NCL) and some pretty amazing venues.
The Freedom’s and Voyager ships’ main dining rooms are probably the
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 189

most impressive at sea — huge, three-level affairs with enormous chan-
deliers and the grand feel of a European opera house. RCI has stayed
with traditional early- and late-seating dinners, with guests dining at
assigned tables. As with the other mainstream lines, you can ditch the
dining rooms and choose from the many casual and specialty venues.
You can dine at Italian specialty restaurants on the Freedom-, Voyager-
and Radiance-class ships and the refurbished Empress of the Seas (for a
$20 surcharge), or at a steakhouse on the Freedom, Radiance-class ships,
and Voyager-class vessels Navigator, Mariner, and Enchantment of the
Seas (also $20 per person). The Freedom- and Voyager-class ships, and
Sovereign of the Seas, have ’50s-style Johnny Rockets diners right out on
deck, serving burgers and the like for a few bucks per-person service
charge. Casual breakfast, lunch, and dinner are also available from the
large buffet restaurant on each ship.
Activities and entertainment
These ships are activity-central. Fleetwide, you can find rock-climbing
walls (with multiple climbing tracks and training available) plus lots of
typical cruise fare: dancing lessons, art auctions, bingo, shuffleboard,
spa and spa demos, wine tastings, oddball crafts/hospitality classes
such as napkin folding, and deck games, including “horse race” gambling
and goofy poolside games like the men’s sexy legs contest.
Sports facilities vary by ship: water park, surfing machine, and boxing
ring on the Freedom; ice-skating rinks and in-line skating tracks on the
Voyager- and Freedom-class ships; combo basketball/volleyball courts
on the Freedom-, Voyager-, Radiance-, and Vision-class ships; and several
ships (the Freedom, Voyager and Radiance classes as well as Splendour
and Legend of the Seas) feature miniature-golf. Shipboard gyms are well-
equipped fleetwide, with specialized fitness classes such as yoga and
kickboxing available for $10 per person. The line’s spas offer the usual
range of massages, facials, and other beauty treatments.
Entertainment-wise, Royal Caribbean spends big bucks on its shows,
high-tech productions that feature singers, dancers, live bands, and fre-
quent headliners and guest artists, including aerialists, comedians, and
name performers from time to time such as the Platters and the Drifters).
Atrium bars feature live music, often classical trios, and the new Latin-
themed Bolero’s bars (aboard Freedom, Navigator, Mariner, Monarch,
Sovereign, and Empress) serve a mean mojito and have Latin music into
the night.
Royal Caribbean is big on wedding packages, with many a vow made in
the Voyager-class ships’ wedding chapels.
For kids
Royal Caribbean offers year-round supervised kids’ programs fleetwide,
with activities for kids aged 3 to 17 (divided into five age groups) on sea
and port days. Each ship has a spacious kids’ playroom and facilities for
teens, though the facilities on the Freedom-, Voyager- and Radiance-class
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
190

ships are far better than those on the line’s older vessels and are among
the best at sea for kids. There are also daily playdates for parents and
infants/toddlers three months to three years old. Group babysitting for
kids three and up is available nightly. Private, in-cabin babysitting for
kids six months and up is available from off-duty crewmembers from 
8 a.m. to 2 a.m.
Figure 11-10: Voyager of the Seas
Fleet facts
The line’s superstars are definitely Freedom of the Seas and the
Voyager-class ships: Voyager, Explorer, Adventure, Navigator, and
Mariner of the Seas. It’s pretty easy to describe what they’ve got: every-
thing. The gigantic new Freedom is essentially a Voyager-ship-plus, with
all that the older ships offer plus new features such as a sprawling water
park, full of spray cannons, water jets, gushers, and sculptural water
guns set off by sensors and other triggers; a pair of giant cantilevered hot
tubs extending 12 feet out over the edge of the ship, some 112 feet above
the sea; and a cavernous gym with a boxing ring. Freedom, and her
slightly older Voyager-class cousins, have more than you’d find at just
about any family-oriented land-based resort in the world. Try, ice-skating
rinks and in-line skating tracks; miniature golf courses and golf simula-
tors; 1950s-style diner sitting right out on deck; regulation-size basketball
courts; huge two-level gyms and spas; gorgeous three-level main restau-
rants; rock-climbing walls; and, perhaps most significantly, the only ships
at sea with a four-story, Main Street–like promenade running more than 
a football field’s length down their center, lined with bars, shops, and
entertainment lounges. Three decks of inside cabins have bay windows
from which their occupants can view the street scene below. More than
any other ship ever built, these really do live up to the old “city at sea”
cliche.
Freedom’s first sister ship arrives in spring 2007 and another is due in
early 2008.
The Radiance-class ships, Radiance, Brilliance, Serenade, and Jewel
of the Seas, are more classic than innovative in their onboard experi-
ence, while offering a lot of the fun and games of the Voyager class,
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 191

including rock climbing, billiards tables, and miniature golf. They’re
Royal Caribbean’s most elegant vessels to date, with shippy lines and
nautical interior décor, full of dark wood paneling, caramel-brown
leathers, and deep-sea-blue fabrics and carpeting. Outside, their sleek
profiles are covered in 110,000 square feet of glass, providing views from
public rooms like the Viking Crown Lounge, the piano bar, and the
Champagne Bar — handy for letting scenery in on Alaska itineraries.
The Vision-class ships, Vision, Splendour, Grandeur, Rhapsody,
Enchantment, and Legend of the Seas, were once paradigms on cruise
ship modernity, but were so quickly eclipsed by their giant Voyager
cousins that now they seem almost quaint. Still, they’re fine enough
ships if the price is right, with an open, light-filled feel and many of the
same amenities offered by the line’s newer, larger ships, including great
solariums, pools, hoppin’ discos, and sprawling outdoor decks. To keep
them up to date, Royal Caribbean has retrofitted them all with rock-
climbing walls, and some are scheduled for major surgery. In 2005,
Enchantment of the Seas was literally sawn in half and then welded back
together with a new midsection, increasing her size and amenities sub-
stantially, including a bungee trampoline where guests strap into a har-
ness connected to bungee cords, to keep them from flying overboard.
On the downside to these ships, their standard cabins are on the small
side, a failing common to Royal Caribbean’s older vessels — including
the Sovereign-class ships, Sovereign, Majesty, and Monarch of the
Seas, which all sail inexpensive 3- and 4-night cruises on the East and
West Coasts. A decade and a half of hard use has given all three of these
vessels their share of bumps, but Royal Caribbean’s been busy scrub-
bing them up over the past two years, refurbishing and rebuilding many
of the interiors on Monarch and Sovereign.
The line’s oldest ship, Empress of the Seas, also got major elective sur-
gery in 2004, updating the décor of her lobbies, elevators, corridors, and
other public areas and transforming some of her lounge spaces into
additional dining, entertainment, and fitness areas. She doesn’t look half
bad, particularly for short cruises, though her cabins are small and
worn.

Chapter 12
Luxury Ships
In This Chapter
 Discovering how luxury cruises are different
 Adding up the cost
 Comparing the luxury lines
A
cruise on a luxury ship isn’t like any other kind of cruise. Erase all
images of conga lines and buckets of Bud, a luxury cruise bares
little resemblance to a cruise on a giant megaship. First of all, luxury
ships are smaller. Service is more attentive, food tastes better, and
cabins are larger and have better amenities. Itineraries are almost
always superior, and the crowd on a luxury ship is calmer and more 
genteel. The list goes on. Oh, they cost more, too. A lot more.
The Low Down on the High End
If all you’ve heard about cruises is that they’re glitzy floating Vegas
resorts full of napkin-folding, bingo-playing, pizza-eating beer chuggers,
well, let’s forget all that and start with a blank slate. The luxury ships
reviewed here are the best of the best, if best to you means eating on
elegant china and sipping a rare vintage from a crystal glass. If you
appreciate a sophisticated waiter who lifts a silver lid from your
chateaubriand, then your ship has come in. Standard cabins on a luxury
ship are usually all suites, outfitted with walk-in closets, stocked mini-
bars, and marble bathrooms large enough to offer a tub, shower, and
double sinks. Expect extras like slippers, bathrobes, and fancy sham-
poos from the likes of Molton Brown and Acqua di Parma.
Most of the luxury vessels are small and intimate, carrying between 100
and 700 guests. And even on the bigger luxury ships (Cunard’s QE2 and
QM2, and Crystal’s Symphony and new Serenity) you’re unlikely to feel lost
in a crowd. The vibe on a luxury ship is one of exclusivity. Passengers are
like members of a private club of experienced travelers who like the good
life and are willing to pay for it. Passengers are mostly adults 50+ — many
a tad on the stuffy side — although you may see some kids on the QM2

and the Crystal ships, which have children’s facilities. (Most luxury lines
have a minimum age of 1 to sail.)
Like their mainstream cousins, luxury ships have pools, gyms, and spas,
Dining is the best at sea, and dinner is served with much pomp and cir-
cumstance. More effort goes in to the preparation of meals and the scope
goes beyond the standard pasta, salmon, and steaks you get on the main-
stream lines. On the lux lines, a fancy daily afternoon tea is the norm as
well as complimentary pre-dinner canapés in the lounges (which few
mainstream lines do). Entertainment and organized activities are more
limited than on mainstream ships (with the exception of Crystal and
Cunard), and most guests on luxury ships like it that way. They prefer
doing cocktails in a piano bar after dinner and chatting about stocks or
their recent travels rather than sweating it up in a disco or sprinting
between the casino and the X-rated comedian doing his shtick in a lounge.
What to wear, what to wear, what to wear? With the exception of
SeaDream Yacht Club, it’s a good idea to bring a tux (ladies, pack your
fancy dresses) for formal nights, as people on these ships tend to dress
for dinner. On the other days, you can find a mix of informal nights
(that’s when men need to wear a jacket and tie) and casual nights, when
button-down shirts are fine for men, with or without a jacket. Women
can wear nice skirts, pants, or dresses on these evenings. All of the
luxury lines also have at least one casual dining venue, where there’s
absolutely no need for a suit or jacket. Exceptions: SeaDream operates
with a no-jackets-required policy through the cruise and on Seabourn
and Crystal ties are optional on all but formal nights.
Keep in mind, most luxury lines (with the exception of Cunard) can only
accommodate two or three passengers per cabin (not including big
suites and penthouses of course). So if you’re set on bringing the kids,
for example, in the standard staterooms on the SeaDream, Regent,
Seabourn, Silversea, and Crystal ships, the third person/child sleeps on
the couch or a rollaway (if there’s space for them at all). If you’ve got a
larger family, you have to spring for two staterooms or a larger suite.
The Little Extras (Really Add Up)
The ultra-luxury ships treat passengers like royalty. Their fares are more
all-inclusive, so while you pay more, you get more too. Here’s a list of
some of the things included in the luxury cruise rates:
 Booze: Seabourn, SeaDream, and Silversea (unlimited spirits, wine
and champagne); Regent Seven Seas (wine with dinner)
 Free stocked minibar: Regent Seven Seas, Seabourn, Silversea,
SeaDream (beer and soft drinks only),Crystal (top suites only) and
Cunard (top suites only)
Chapter 12: Luxury Ships 195

 A special shore excursion: Seabourn, SeaDream, and Silversea (on
some or all cruises)
 Tips: Included on Seabourn, SeaDream, Silversea, and Regent Seven
Seas
 Unlimited soda/bottled water: Crystal, Seabourn, SeaDream,
Silversea, and Regent Seven Seas
 Watersports: Seabourn and SeaDream
 Other goodies: Godiva pillow chocolates nightly (Silversea); cotton
logo pj’s (SeaDream); CD of classic jazz (Seabourn); luggage tags
and document portfolio (Seabourn offers Tumi versions)
Around the World
Where don’t they go should be the question. Luxury ships tend to globe-
trot and offer a more eclectic and varied itinerary schedule than the
mainstream ships we discuss in Chapter 11. They often sail from a differ-
ent home port every week or stay in one region only long enough to
offer a few itineraries and then move on to another part of the world.
Since most luxury ships are substantially smaller than the big main-
stream ships, they can and do visit smaller, less accessible ports.
You want the world? Then you gotta pay. A typical luxury cruise will run
you about $300 to $600 per person a day, more if you book the penthouse.
Still, keep a lookout for deals, the luxury lines offer special promotions
too, from free airfare to the port of embarkation to two-for-one deals. It’s a
good idea to book a luxury cruise through an agency that specializes in
them. See Chapter 4 for recommended agencies.

 Ship size/style: Modern midsize luxury ships
Offering the best of both worlds, Crystal gracefully straddles the line
between active big ship and refined small one, its two vessels — the
Crystal Symphony and younger cousin Crystal Serenity — carrying no
more than 1,080 passengers, double-occupancy. The pair doles out top-
of-the-line service and cuisine, plus lots of outdoor deck space, generous
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
196

fitness facilities, tons of activities, multiple restaurants (including the
best Asian venues at sea), and more than half a dozen bars and enter-
tainment venues.
Unlike Seabourn’s small ships, which tend to be more calm and staid,
this Japanese-owned, Los Angeles–based line lives by a more sociable
California ethic and its large-ish passenger capacity tends to keep things
mingly, chatty, and fairly active.
Décor wise, you’ll find both dark wood-paneled rooms and light pastel
ones, along with plenty of marble, glass, fresh flowers, and potted plants.
Overall, the newer Serenity (see Figure 12-1) has deeper, richer colors,
while the Symphony sports more of the lighter champagnes, grays, whites,
and blues — especially in the atrium, where things are a tad on the shiny
side with chrome and brassy railings.
If there was a downside to all of this upside, it’s that most cabins on both
these ships are quite a bit smaller than those on Silversea, Seabourn, and
Regent — though Crystal’s prices are usually a good deal lower than
Seabourn and Silversea, too. If you want big, of course, you can always
book a suite or penthouse.

Dining
Crystal’s cuisine is among the best at sea, especially if you love Asian
food. In addition to the formal dining room that operates with an early
or late seating system, there is an Italian and one or two Asian alterna-
tive restaurants, plus a poolside grille, an indoor cafe, and a casual
restaurant that puts on great themed Asian, Mediterranean, South
American/Cuban, and “other” luncheon buffets. All menus include light
and low-fat options as well as vegetarian, low-carb, sugar-free, gluten-
free, and kosher foods.
The line’s Asian venues are among the best at sea. Symphony’s Jade
Garden showcases the Asian cuisine of Wolfgang Puck’s acclaimed Santa
Monica restaurant, Chinois on Main, while master chef Nobuyuki “Nobu”
Matsuhisa partnered with Crystal to create menus for Serenity’s Sushi
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
198

Bar and its Pan-Asian restaurant, Silk Road. Dishes feature Nobu’s eclec-
tic blends of Japanese cuisine with Peruvian and European influences.
How does lobster with truffle yuzu sauce sound? Yum-meeeee! Both
ships also have an Italian restaurant called Valentino at Prego, serving
cuisine by award-winning restaurateur Piero Selvaggio.
Room service is offered 24 hours a day, naturally.
Activities and entertainment
There’s a lot to do on the Crystal ships. Entertainment runs the gamut
from classical concertos by accomplished pianists to comedy and the
standard cruise/Vegas-style song-and-dance revues. Each ship also has
lounges for dancing to live music as well as a fairly lively casino, a dark
and cozy piano bar, a cigar bar, and a movie theater. There are always
several enrichment lectures on each cruise (such as a historian present-
ing a slide show and speaking about the Panama Canal and how it was
built, a former Ambassador speaking about regional politics, or a movie
critic talking about Hollywood films), and dozens of sailings each year
are focused on art, film, jazz, wellness, and other subjects. More than a
dozen annual Wine & Food Festival cruises feature a respected wine
expert who conducts at least two complimentary tastings, plus guest
chefs conducting cooking demonstrations for guests and then present-
ing the results of those lessons at dinner.
You’ll find free group dancing and golf lessons and private versions of
same for a fee. There are also music lessons, language classes, and tai
chi. Both ships also offer a nice-size gym, Feng-shui inspired spas,
paddle-tennis courts, shuffleboard, Ping-Pong, a jogging circuit, golf-
driving nets, and a putting green.
Gentlemen hosts are available to dance and socialize with solo female
passengers on all cruises.
In a huge computer lab, a complimentary 30-course computer curricu-
lum is offered on all cruises, with topics such as a basic computer use,
understanding the Internet, and creating spreadsheets using Excel.
There are also private lessons available for $50 an hour.
For kids
Though no Disney, Crystal does its part for families looking for a luxury
getaway. Each ship has a playroom outfitted with PlayStation video
games and personal computers among other goodies, plus there’s a teen
center and video arcade. When demand warrants it — primarily used
during holiday and summer cruises (mostly in Europe) — there are
supervised activities for three age groups between 3 and 17. Private in-
cabin babysitting can be arranged for kids aged 6 months to 12 years
through the concierge at an hourly rate of $7.50 for one child, $10 for
two kids, and $13 for three kids.
Chapter 12: Luxury Ships 199

If your bambinos are still on jar food, no need to lug a suitcase full: With
advance notice, the ship will order what you need at no charge and
having it waiting. Or, the chef will puree organic food for your baby.
Crystal frequently offers kids-sail-free promotion, especially on its
Alaska itineraries.
Figure 12-1: Crystal Serenity
Fleet facts
Handsome ships by any standard, Crystal Serenity and Crystal
Symphony have some of the highest space-per-passenger ratios of any
cruise ships in the industry. They’re both exceedingly roomy, but Serenity
is even more so: 38 percent bigger than Symphony, but with only 15 per-
cent more guests. Serenity boasts expanded spa and fitness areas and
more dining venues, entertainment lounges, and penthouses (the biggest
four are each a whopping 1,345 sq. ft.). If you’re lucky enough to stay in
one, you’re treated to full-on butler service.
Rates include unlimited nonalcoholic drinks everywhere aboard, includ-
ing cappuccino, soda, and bottled water. There’s also a pillow menu in
the cabins, offering regular king- and standard-size pillows as well as
four specialty options.

 Type of cruise: Luxury, elegant, classic, romantic
 Ship size/style: Megaship ocean liner
The oldest name in the cruise biz, Cunard offered the first regularly
scheduled service across the Atlantic way back in the 1840s, and today
it’s the only passenger line still doing so, aboard some of the few true
ocean liners still going. A niche market catering to nostalgists and avio-
phobes, you ask? To a point, but what’s wrong with that? In its public
persona, Cunard is all about tradition, stressing the built-tough strength
and history-minded opulence of its great ships and the old-fashioned
British formality of its onboard experience. In private, however —
behind the scenes, where passengers rarely see — Cunard is perversely
of its time, its land-side operations run out of the same suburban Los
Angeles offices that house Princess Cruises (both companies being sub-
sidiaries of giant Carnival Corporation).
For the past few decades, Cunard passengers have tended to be tradi-
tionalists as well — older, well-traveled folks who appreciated the line’s
history and slightly frumpled graciousness. On transatlantic voyages
they ceased being primarily British long ago (Americans are the line’s
number-one customers there), but with the huge launch of the huge
Queen Mary 2 in 2004, Carnival Corp. signaled that Cunard was open for
even more new business. That ship got so much press that it’s now once
again hip to go transatlantic by water instead of plane. Like Cunard’s ads
said back in the fifties, getting there is half the fun.
Queen Mary 2 (also known as QM2) provides one of the most distinctive
luxury experiences you can get on a ship so large, appealing to both
romantic types and (surprisingly) families, especially on summer Atlantic
crossings.
QM2 replaced Cunard’s legendary Queen Elizabeth 2 (also known as QE2,
the iconic name by which it’s been known since its 1969 launch) on the
line’s transatlantic routes almost immediately after her launch. QE2 now
sails from a homeport in Southampton, UK, carrying primarily British
passengers. A third queen, dubbed Queen Victoria, is currently under
construction and set to debut in 2007. At 85,000 GRTs she’ll still be a
substantial vessel, though nowhere near the size of the 151,400-ton QM2.
Sail Cunard to experience some inkling of the way people traveled a cen-
tury ago, with grand interiors and a sense of empirical exceptionalism —
rule Britannia, Britannia rule the waves, and all that. Sail QM2 to see the
best built and probably most technologically advanced passenger ship
in the world, to be the envy of your friends, or to just stand there and
say, “Gee, it’s big.” Sail QE2 for a real dose of history.

Dining
Like QE2, QM2 works on a vestigial multi-class system left over from 
the ocean liner days. Back then, first-class passengers could go their
whole voyage and hardly see anyone booked in second-class or steer-
age. Today, however, the separation is only noticeable in a few spots on
board. Essentially, cabin level determines where one dines: Passengers
in the top suites dine in special restaurants, while everyone else dines in
the main Britannia dining room (a gorgeous spot, far more grand than
the suite guests’ more quietly posh Queens Grill and Princess Grill) or 
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
202

in one of the alternative venues — such as Todd English, a branch of
celebrity Boston chef English’s Olives restaurant; cover is $30 per
person.
The two grill restaurants serve dinner in a single seating, while Brittania
has early and late seatings. All three also serve breakfast and lunch in
open seatings. Food sticks close to tradition, with entrees that might
include pheasant with southern haggis and port wine sauce, roasted
prime rib, and grilled lobster with garden pea risotto. On a recent cruise,
the food and service were good, on par roughly with what you might
experience in the main dining rooms of the Celebrity ships. Health-con-
scious Canyon Ranch Spa (which also runs QM2’s onboard spa) cuisine
is also available as a matter of course. In the Grill restaurants, you can
also make special requests — if they have the ingredients aboard, some-
one in the galley will whip up whatever you desire. Otherwise, it’s really
the intimacy and cachet of the Grill restaurants that sets them apart
from the others more than the food does, as many of the same menu
items are offered in the Britannia as well.
King’s Court is an enormous buffet that’s partitioned off at night to
create three separate restaurants, a grill-type carvery, an Italian restau-
rant, and a pan-Asian outlet. All are free, though reservations are recom-
mended. A fourth venue adjacent to King’s Court, the Chef’s Galley
serves just a handful of guests in a demo-kitchen-style set up ($30 per
person includes wine).
Activities and entertainment
QM2 boasts an impressive list of guest lecturers, including experts from
Oxford University and other universities, plus a medley of accomplished
authors and experts who speak on everything from literature to political
history, ocean-liner history, music and culture, Shakespeare on film, archi-
tectural history, cooking, computer applications, languages, and many
other topics. Course listings for the Oxford University lecture program
(presented on the Transatlantic crossings) are available on the Cunard
website 90 days ahead of each sailing. Passengers can also take advantage
of the largest library at sea (most ship libraries are pretty pitiful, but truly,
this one rocks), as well as a maritime history trail that snakes around the
ship, a spa operated by Canyon Ranch, a Monte Carlo–style casino, and an
honest-to-god planetarium, with 3D presentations created by New York’s
Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space
Museum.
Entertainment runs the gamut from plays featuring graduates of Britain’s
Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts to run-of-the-mill song-and-dance revues.
There’s also a wide variety of music, including jazz, classical, and dance
music of the old-fashioned and new-fashioned kind (presented in the
adjoining Queen’s Ballroom and G32 disco).
Chapter 12: Luxury Ships 203

For kids
Most luxury ships have little for kids, but QM2 is a major exception to
that rule, offering a program and facilities for kids as young as age 1.
There’s a nursery with ten crib/toddler-bed combos for napping tots,
playrooms and an outdoor play area, activities for several different age
groups, and a staff of real British nannies and activities councilors. The
kids’ center is open long hours, too (until midnight), so parents can take
advantage of the ship’s dining options in peace. There’s even a special
children’s tea daily from 5 to 6 p.m. in the Chef’s Galley.
Figure 12-2: Queen Mary 2
Fleet facts
Carnival Corporation promised to expand Cunard’s fleet when it bought
the line in 1998, and boy did it ever. Launched to tremendous fanfare in
early 2004, the 151,400-GRT, 2,620-passenger Queen Mary 2 (see Figure 12-2)
was the first true ocean liner built since Cunard minted QE2 back in 1969.
What’s that mean? It means strength, speed, and extraordinary sea-keeping
abilities — all essential ingredients to maintaining a schedule on the
sometimes brutal north Atlantic.
Inside, the ship is pretty spectacular, its public rooms impressive for both
their range and quality. Even after being aboard six days on the Atlantic,
you might still find spots you’ve never seen before. Our favorites? The
classic deco-style Chart Room for drinks before dinner; the forward facing
Commodore Club with its clubby atmosphere; the grand Queen’s Room
ballroom on formal night; and the forward observation deck on Deck 11,
just below the bridge — probably the best spot aboard when sailing out of
New York Harbor, QM2’s western terminus when sailing transatlantic.
Other great spots? The spa and library (see preceding), the elegant Veuve
Clicquot champagne bar, and the lively Golden Lion Pub.
As for QE2, she sails on as indomitably as ever, offering Mediterranean
and other European cruises as well as occasional trips to the Canary
Islands and an annual world cruise, touching down everywhere. She’s 
no kid, having sailed more than 5.3 million nautical miles and carried
nearly three million passengers, but she’s a real grande dame, with some

gorgeous public spaces mixed amid a charmingly old-fashioned, maze-
like layout. Think more Anne Bancroft than Catherine Zeta-Jones.

 Type of cruise: Luxury, gourmet, romantic
 Ship size/style: Midsize modern luxury ships
Regent Seven Seas — which changed its name from Radisson Seven Seas
in early 2006 — offers a cruise experience that’s upscale but not uptight:
homey and comfortable, with outstanding service, great cuisine, and
itineraries that range the world, from Alaska and the Caribbean to Tahiti
and Antarctica. Honestly upscale but without pretense, it’s the perfect
cruise line for people who have sailed with mainstream or premium lines
and are looking to step up.
The line appeals primarily to well-heeled passengers in their 50s and up,
with a few younger passengers and honeymooners peppering the mix.
Though the typical Regent passenger has refined tastes, he or she also
appreciates the line’s less formal ambience, which is comfortably casual
and laid-back during the day.
The line’s ships are modern and midsized, with the twin Seven Seas
Mariner (see Figure 12-3) and Seven Seas Voyager carrying 700 passen-
gers apiece and Seven Seas Navigator carrying 490. Regent also charters
two ships, one sailing in Tahiti and the other doing an annual series of
Antarctica cruises.
For all that it offers, Regent’s rates are often surprisingly low, with good
early-booking discounts, two-for-one deals, and free or discounted air-
fare almost always available.
Chapter 12: Luxury Ships 205

Service is some of the best in the cruise business. Restaurant waiters are
gracious and professional, cabin stewardesses deft and unobtrusive, and
room service fast and efficient. Bar staff will often remember your drink
order after the first day. Like most of the other luxury lines, Regent bun-
dles gratuities into the cruise fare.

Dining
Regent’s cuisine is superb, complemented by complimentary red and
white house wines. Main dining room and alternative restaurants across
the fleet all operate on an open-seating basis — sit where you want, when
you want (though the alternative restaurants require that you make reser-
vations). In the main restaurants, meals are elaborate and elegant, with
entrees that may include zucchini-wrapped chicken breast stuffed with
olives and tomatoes, herb-crusted roast leg of lamb, and fresh fish.
Aboard Seven Seas Mariner and Voyager, passengers have the choice of
three alternative restaurants: Signatures, directed by chefs from Paris’s
famed Le Cordon Bleu cooking school; Latitudes, serving pan-Asian
“Indochine cuisine;” and La Veranda, serving Mediterranean and North
Chapter 12: Luxury Ships 207

African dishes in a casual setting. Seven Seas Navigator’s single alterna-
tive choice is Portofino, an indoor/outdoor Italian restaurant.
Activities and entertainment
As aboard almost all the luxury ships, entertainment and activities are
limited and low-key, with passengers preferring to enjoy their vacation
at their own pace. Offerings often include lectures by former diplomats,
writers, anthropologists, and naturalists, frequently speaking on a topic
relevant to the region you’re sailing. You can also take dance lessons;
attend a wine tasting or art auctions; play cards, bingo, or bridge (with
instructors sailing on all cruises); or, aboard Mariner and Voyager, take a
computer class.
The line also offers great spas, run by French company Carita of Paris
and staffed by therapists and hairdressers imported from Parisian salons.
In mid-2005 Regent introduced a fleetwide program of science-related
activities created by oceanographer Jean-Michel Cousteau. Cousteau
himself presents talks, lectures, and shore excursions on select cruises;
on others, experts from his Ocean Futures Society lead informal work-
shops and discussions on marine life and undersea habitats. Passengers
may watch their dives via live TV uplinks. On other cruises, Regent
offers a series of cooking workshops led by chefs trained in the Le
Cordon Bleu cooking method. The cost for the full workshop series is
$395 per person.
Most evening entertainment is low-key, as aboard most luxury ships. 
You can choose from musical revues in the show lounges, music in other
public rooms, and occasional performances from local entertainers. A
headline entertainer (usually a soloist or comedian) sails with each
cruise. Regent also programs occasional themed sailings — a Doo-Wop
cruises or a “Spotlight on Classical Music” cruise, for instance.
On select sailings, “Circle of Interest” programs offers guests the ability
to book ship-and-shore packages themed on specific interests, such as
art, nature, antiques, and archaeology. The program features onboard
lectures and workshops, plus specially created excursions and events
led by guest experts. Pre-cruise, passengers can also take advantage of a
telephone concierge service that helps them customize shore programs
based on their particular interests and take advantage of special limited-
participation “Concierge Choice” shore excursions.
For kids
Like the other luxury lines, Regent in general isn’t geared toward chil-
dren, though summer sailings and select holiday cruises do offer a kids
program for kids 6 to 17, divided into two age groups. On other cruises,
an ad-hoc kids program is put together if enough kids are aboard to
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
208

require it. Private babysitting may be arranged (for a fee) with off-duty
crewmembers.
Figure 12-3: Seven Seas Mariner
Fleet facts
The all-suite Seven Seas Mariner, introduced in 2001, was the first vessel
built by any line to offer a private balcony on every stateroom. She was
also designed to be super-spacious, with a higher passenger-space ratio
(the amount of interior space per passenger, mathematically speaking)
than any cruise vessel besides Silversea’s Silver Shadow and Silver
Whisper — and she ain’t that far behind them. Sister ship Seven Seas
Voyager, which entered service two years later, is very nearly as spa-
cious, trading a few square feet for an improved layout of public rooms.
Improved also are the stateroom bathrooms, which are among the roomi-
est and most comfortable on any cruise ship today. The same bathrooms
actually debuted with Regent aboard Seven Seas Navigator in 1999.
Smaller than her two newer fleetmates, she has attractive public spaces
and all-suite, all-outside accommodations, 90 percent of them with private
balconies.
The small, beautifully appointed Paul Gauguin was built to sail around
Tahiti year-round, and is under a charter contract to Regent through the
end of 2008. Regent also charters an expedition ship called Explorer II
(previously Minerva) for annual January sailings in Antarctica.

 Type of cruise: Gourmet, luxury, romantic
 Ship size/style: Small luxury ships
Calling itself The Yachts of Seabourn, this line makes the most of its
ships’ small and intimate size. Peers Silversea and Regent may have
newer ships, but they’re larger. With 157 crewmembers to just 208
guests, service is very personal; staff members greet you by name from
the moment you check in. They indulge guests with special little extras
like free mini-massages on deck and soothing Eucalyptus oil baths
drawn in suites upon request.
The ships’ small size also allows guests to mingle easily with each other
and crew, and enjoy mellow pursuits such as trivia games and presenta-
tions by guest lecturers. The petite ships are able to visit less-touristed
ports that larger ships may not be able to access, and the wealthy, well-
traveled clientele likes that exclusivity. Many have traveled with Seabourn
before, and they come back again and again for the excellent food, wine,
and the overall genteel surroundings.
Under the Carnival Corporation umbrella since 1991, the line’s roots are
Norwegian. The captains are Norwegian, you may find your suite mini-
bar stocked with bottles of Norwegian Ringnes pilsner, and there’s no
denying the ships’ décor is very Scandinavian, with its cool, almost icy
sea of pastels.

side restaurants. Needless to say cuisine is a highlight of a Seabourn
cruise. In the main, open-seating dining room — the more formal of the
ships’ two dining venues — savor dishes such as a Mediterranean-style
pan seared halibut with anchovies and served with a warm, Niçoise-style
salad, capers and black olives, or a duo of grilled hanger steak and
Guinness braised short rib served with grain mustard mashed potatoes
and tomato compote. Mmmm, salivating yet?
The most divine setting may be the outside decks of the always-casual
Veranda Café, with the churning wake shushing just below you. This
venue also has indoor seating and breakfast and lunch are offered in 
a combination of buffet and table-service. Every evening per cruise,
including on formal nights, the Veranda Café is transformed in to a new
venue called “2” that features multi-course tasting menus (reservations
recommended). Chefs prepare an array of small plates during the five- 
to six-course meals, where you sample the likes of soba noodle and sea-
weed salad with sesame vinaigrette; grilled Striped Bass with a roasted
vegetables; and ending with something like vanilla beignets sauced with
caramel apple.
Aside from a vegetarian selection and a lighter choice on all menus, if
you’ve got ideas of your own, just ask. If the chef has the ingredients on
board, your wishes will be met. On formal nights in the Restaurant tuxes
and sequins are the uniform of choice, while you can get away with a
jacket (and no tie) in the Veranda Café.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships

Overall, and service is as good as it gets on the high seas: attentive,
unobtrusive, and professional.
About 18 or so complimentary wines and champagne are served at lunch
and dinner, as well as at any time and place on the ships (ditto for spirits
and soft drinks); an extensive list of other vintages is also available for
purchase.
One night on each warm-weather itinerary there is an over-the-top buffet
dinner served out on deck by the pool and silver-service beach barbe-
cues in remote ports — we’re talking china and linen, and, of course,
champagne and caviar. The 24-hour room service includes the option of
ordering off the restaurant menus during normal lunch or dinner hours.
Feeling indulgent? Jumbo shrimp and caviar can be ordered poolside, or
anywhere else for that matter, at no charge.
Activities and entertainment
The Seabourn ships are sociable because of their small size, but don’t
offer too much in the way of organized activities and entertainment.
That’s how the guests like it. By day, there are trivia contests, galley
tours, computer classes, wine tastings, bridge tournaments, and the
ever-popular Liar’s Club.
At least one and often two guest lecturers per cruise discuss upcoming
ports as well as other random topics. Noted chefs, scientists, historians,
authors, or statesmen may be aboard, or maybe a wine connoisseur,
composer, anthropologist, TV director, actor, or professor, presenting
lectures and mingling with guests.
Each ship has two roomy entertainment lounges where a cabaret singer
or two, solo instrumentalist (harpist, pianist, violinist), quartet, or maybe
a comedian performs. Before dinner, a pianist plays and sings for guests
enjoying cocktails in The Club; adjacent is the tiny casino with a handful
of card tables and slots.
The Seabourn Legend (see Figure 12-4), Pride, and Spirit each have a teak-
decked platform hidden in their hulls that, when lowered, provides a
launching point for water sports — Sunfish sailboats, kayaks, snorkeling
gear, high-speed banana boats, and water skis are available for use.
For kids
These ships are geared to adults and there are no special programs for
kids (bring your nanny). In a pinch, you may be able to negotiate private
in-suite babysitting with an off-duty crewmember.
Single travelers can get run-of-the-ship discounts, whereby Seabourn
picks your cabin based on availability, and you save big bucks; reap 10
percent savings for combining two cruises; repeat passengers get 5 per-
cent discounts if booking your next cruise onboard your current one;
and rack up 140 days of sailing with Seabourn and get a free cruise!
Chapter 12: Luxury Ships 213

Figure 12-4: Seabourn Legend
Fleet facts
All the cabins on the Legend, Pride, and Spirit are suites with either 5-
foot-wide picture windows or sliding glass doors with railings offering
sea views and breezes (only the top six Owner’s Suites have proper bal-
conies). All suites also have new Bose Wave radio/CD players (a library
of music and book CDs is available onboard) and flat-panel TVs and
DVD. Each also has a complimentary bar setup, walk-in closet, and
marble bathroom.
Though not exactly spring chickens in the youth-obsessed cruise indus-
try, Seabourn has kept up appearances with the occasional nip and tuck.
Sliding glass doors were added to 36 suites on each ship a few years
back, for example, and the gyms were increased in size in 2003 to make
room for classes like yoga and Pilates.
The cruise fare includes tips, wine and spirits, plus one special shore
excursion (like a private visit to a museum after hours).

SeaDream Yacht Club
2601 South Bayshore Dr., Penthouse 1B, Coconut Grove, FL 33133; % 800-707-4911;
www.seadreamyachtclub.com
 Type of cruise: Luxury (country club chic), romantic
 Ship size/style: Small, yacht-like
Size does matter. And in the case of the two ships, SeaDream I and
SeaDream II (shown in Figure 12-5), from SeaDream Yacht Club, smaller
is totally better. These ships are exclusive and yachty — lots of stained
wood floors and exotic floral arrangements — and also offer some cool
stuff to do for those active 40- to 60-somethings attracted to SeaDream’s
version of the good life.
When the owners of SeaDream, Atle Brynestad and Larry Pimentel, the
founder and former president of Seabourn Cruise Line, respectively, took
over the former Sea Goddess ships from Cunard (operated most recently
as part of the Seabourn brand), they promised “an extraordinary, ultra-
luxury, mega-yachting experience not currently available.” They’ve made
good on their promise. With each ship carrying 110 guests in 55 suites
(with 89 crew members at your beck and call), these small ships offer a
really intimate, personalized trip. Excellent service and fine dining are
the big draws, along with a “yacht casual” dress code (no jackets are
required, though some where them).
At only 344 feet long, these twins can slip into ports that other ships
couldn’t even hope to, including docking curbside in places like Monte
Carlo.
The ships were built in the 1980s, and the space ratio is smallish by
today’s standards. Cruisers don’t have tons of inside public space, but
SeaDream refitted the ships to provide plenty of excellent outside space,
with such touches as queen-size Sun Beds and hammocks.
Dining
The vibe on board may be casual and carefree, but the food, wine, and
service are seriously good. Open-seating dining is offered from 7:30 to 
10 p.m. in the main restaurant on Deck 2, though it’s not always easy to
snag a table for two. Generally, you’re seated with other guests unless
you want to wait for an available two top; by day two or three, many pas-
sengers choose to sit at a larger table with new friends. For something
more interesting, you can venture “out” for dinner by requesting a spot
in advance at one of several private alcoves on Deck 6, or even on the
bridge. The partially covered, open-sided Topside Restaurant on Deck 5
serves breakfast and lunch daily, with guests choosing from a buffet or
menu, and a sit-down dinner is served there as well several nights per
cruise. Menus include a healthy option as well as a vegetarian entrée,
Chapter 12: Luxury Ships 215

and the galley will prepare special requests provided that the ingredi-
ents are on board.
Jackets are not required at any time, though some men wear them
anyway. On our recent cruise, passengers’ interpretation of the informal
dress code ranged from a classic navy blue sport jacket to Bermuda
shorts and a t-shirt — the later frowned upon by the Hotel Manager, but
generally overlooked. It’s not easy to tell someone who paid several thou-
sand dollars for their cruise to go back to the cabin to change clothes.
Lavish beach barbecues, called the Caviar and Champagne Splash, are
offered on Jost Van Dyke and Virgin Gorda. Sit back and enjoy the show
as 20-something waiters in Hawaiian shirts wade into the surf and serve
caviar and champagne (and lots of it) from a floating surfboard. On a
recent cruise, every single person from the ship got into the crazy little
ritual and happily bobbed around the surf, plastic champagne flute in
hand. Afterwards, a casual, but ample, beach buffet is served under
umbrellas at tables set with proper china and hotel silver brought
ashore by the staff.
Aside from 24-hour room service, there are sandwiches and snacks at
the Topside restaurant throughout the day and/or poolside. You can also
order a generous portion of jumbo shrimp cocktail whenever the mood
strikes. (On a recent cruise, the mood struck Heidi while in the hot tub . . .
life’s tough). Rates include unlimited spirits, wine, and soft drinks,
though oddly cabin minifridges are stocked only with complimentary
beer and soft drinks.
Activities and entertainment
Like real yachts, you are meant to spend your SeaDream days up on the
open decks or exploring port.
Itineraries are designed so that ships stay late in many ports they visit
(for example, in places like St. Barts and St. Tropez) so you can explore
the restaurant scene and nightlife shoreside.
By day, most people who remain aboard are tanning or canoodling on a
cushy sun bed poolside, drinking in hand — the setting is totally roman-
tic. Some spend time in the gym or Asian-influence spa. There’s also a
small library and staterooms keep couch potatoes content with DVD and
CD players, flat-screen TVs, and Internet accessibility (which can also be
found in the library).
If you forget your iPod, you can borrow an MP3 players loaded with
music from the reception desk.
When the sun goes down, guests go up to the Top of the Yacht bar to
mingle over drinks. Typical cruise ship entertainment is limited: on a
recent cruise, a pianist played after dinner in the Main Salon lounge, 
while a guitarist serenaded dinners at the entrance to the restaurant and
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
216

sometimes afterwards up on deck at the Top of the Yacht bar.
Occasionally, local bands are brought on for the night, and there is 
tiny casino area with two poker tables and handful of slots. Weather 
permitting, a film may be shown on the large movie screen set up on
deck, complete with popcorn.
The ships carry aboard sea kayaks, Sunfish, and WaveRunners that can
be accessed from the ships’ watersports marina when docked in calm
seas. There are also mountain bikes, a golf simulator, and Segway Human
Transporters (they’re upright two-wheel Jetsons-like scooters that you
can use in port for $49 for 45 minutes).
For kids
Like the other small luxury ships, these are not geared to kids. There are
no babysitting services or child-related activities. Teens, on the other
hand, may enjoy these cruises’ emphasis on watersports and unstruc-
tured activities.
SeaDream offers special promotions from time to time, for example, to
save 10 percent when booking two or three consecutive sailings. They
also do “Sail with Friends” promotions, which vary due to supply and
demand; a recent the discount was get one free cabin when you buy nine
cabins.

Fleet facts
Standard cabins on the SeaDream I and II measure 195 square feet, just
a tad larger than Carnival’s standard cabins (though, of course, much
more plush). Each suite has an appealing nautical flair thanks to lots of
real wood cabinetry and molding, plus you’ll find a small sitting area
with a couch (that can accommodate a third adult or a child). Sixteen
are convertible to a double-sized room — called a Commodore Club
Stateroom — by booking two connecting rooms (essentially creating a
suite with two bathrooms and a living room). At 490 square feet, the one

Owner’s Suite is extremely luxurious. None of the staterooms have private
balconies, though all of them have ocean views and were refurbished a
few years back, offering luxurious Belgian linen, plus tech stuff like CD and
DVD players, and a flat-screen TV with Internet capability. The bathrooms
are compact, but stocked with Bulgari toiletries. Rates include all spirits,
wine, tips, and some shore excursions. Table 12-10 shows current fleet

 Type of cruise: Gourmet, luxury, romantic
 Ship size/style: Modern, smallish luxury ships
The Pommery Brut Royal is flowing on Silversea’s four ships and the
suites’ marble bathrooms are stocked with Italian Acqua di Parma bath
products. Tables are set with Christofle silver and Schott-Zwiesel crys-
tal, beds are made up with fine Irish bed linens by Hilden and wonder-
fully soft down pillows, and the passengers are dressed in the finest
money can buy. Need we go on?
Fine-tuned and genteel, Silversea aims to please the most discerning and
well-traveled cruisers in the world. The food and service are the best at
sea, and the ships’ Italian-style decor is warm and inviting. Founded by
an Italian shipping family in the early 90s, the line’s four ships — the 296-
passenger Silver Cloud and Silver Wind and the newer 382-passenger
Silver Shadow and Silver Whisper (see Figure 12-6) — were built and out-
fitted at shipyards in Italy. No expense was spared in their design and
execution, and it shows.
For the ultimate in cruise line flexibility, Silversea’s Personalized Voyages
allows passengers to create their own itineraries and get on and off at
many ports other than those officially designated as embarkation and
debarkation ports. You pay a daily rate, with a 5-night minimum stay
required.

Dining
If you’re a foodie and a ship lover, a Silversea cruise is a must, its chefs
serving consistently creative, beautifully presented dishes in the ships’
three restaurants: a formal open-seating venue and two more casual
options, with all three open for dinner most evenings. The main dining
rooms are elegant affairs with live music and small dance floors, but the
line really shines at La Terrazza, a lovely windowed venue that offers
Italian cuisine created by chef Marco Betti. A second alternative venue
offers a new twist on cruise dining, with menus that pair food with wine —
and not the other way around. Developed in consultation with master
sommeliers trained at Relais & Châteaux–Relais Gourmands boutique
hotels and restaurants, its wine menus reflect regions of the world known
for their rich wine heritage, including France, Italy, northern California,
South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Guests enjoy a different wine
with each course, with the extra charge for dinner varying in accordance
with the wines served.
Even in the regular dining rooms, though, Silversea’s wine list is superb,
with several complimentary wines suggested at each meal from more
than 40 choices. You can also purchase one of the wines not included 
in the complimentary list — a $745 Château Margaux 1990, anyone?
There are plenty of tables for two in all restaurants, though you may
have to wait for one in the main dining room.
Once per cruise, passengers are invited into the galley for the traditional
galley brunch, in which a red carpet is rolled out through the galley and
passengers are free to nosh from more than 100 dishes. Out on the pool
deck, you can also stay in your suit and grab a burger, sandwich, or
salad. The line’s 24-hour room-service menu includes such decadent
choices as caviar and jumbo shrimp cocktail. You can also order off The
Restaurant’s menu during its dinnertime operating hours and have your
meal served in your suite course-by-course.
Activities and entertainment
After a lovely day touring, say, Singapore or Stockholm, guests dress for
dinner and enjoy low-key socializing over cocktails in the piano bar. For
something a bit more razzmatazz, each ship has a casino and a two-level
show lounge where small-scale song-and-dance revues and perform-
ances by classical musicians and other artists are on tap.
By day, you can enjoy cruise standards like trivia games, card tourna-
ments, golf putting/driving, wine-tasting seminars, and stretch and 
aerobics classes. Or, you can feed your brain and take in one of
Silversea’s impressive enrichment lectures. At least one guest speaker
from a wide range of disciplines is featured on every sailing, including
the likes of Walter Cronkite, William F. Buckley, Jr., film critic Rex Reed,
and other explorers, authors, diplomats, and distinguished personages.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
222

For golfers, the “Silver Links 365” program offers daily onboard instruc-
tion by PGA-classed professionals plus play at acclaimed courses in the
four corners of the globe.
The line’s Culinary theme cruises are hosted by Relais Gourmands chefs
and feature demos and tastings in the ships’ Viking Cooking Schools,
where guests can cook along with the chefs. There are also a number 
of wine-themed cruises hosted by famous vintners.
The ships’ Balinese-inspired Mandara spa beckons with its flower-strewn
copper foot bowls, warm massage rocks, and other Asian-inspired treat-
ments. To avoid waiting in line to experience it, you can book your treat-
ments online before your cruise (at www.silversea.com).
For kids
As you might expect, these are not kid-centric ships in any way, shape,
or form. There are no organized activities for them and no playrooms,
though you might be able to arrange in-cabin babysitting evenings if a
crewmember is available. If your kids are young, though, do yourself
(and everyone else) a favor and bring a nanny.
Figure 12-6: Silver Whisper
Fleet facts
No mere “cabins” here. Instead, all the appealing suites on all four
Silversea ships have walk-in closets and marble bathrooms, and most
have balconies. The standard suites are slightly bigger on the newer
Whisper and Shadow (285 sq. ft. compared to 248 sq. ft. on the Cloud
and Wind, not including the balconies), and their bathrooms are the
best at sea, with double sinks, separate long tub and shower, and fabu-
lous Aqua di Parma bath products. Each suite also has a minibar, DVD
player, sitting area, lighted dressing table with hair dryer, writing desk,
feather-down pillows and duvets, and Egyptian cotton linens. Fares
include all wines, spirits, champagne, stocked mini-bar, tips, free shut-
tles from ports to city centers, and on select cruises, a special shore-side
cultural event.

ike the idea of travel by sea, but you’ve read over the preceding
couple of chapters and found yourself thinking, “Well, that seems
like it would really suck.” The megaships sound too Vegas for you (or
Cancun, or Miami, or any other high-octane resort), and the luxury ships

passengers, the biggest ship in this chapter carries only 436 — and the
smallest carries (get this) 6. That, all by itself, means you get a com-
pletely different cruise experience with these ships — more personal,
more flexible, and more low-key.
The downside is that because most small and sailing ships carry few
passengers and operate in popular niche markets, they don’t play the
same constant discounting game as the big lines. Often, the prices they
list in their brochures are exactly what you end up paying — and those
prices are almost always higher than the mainstream lines to begin with.
You can find a few bargains among cruises on these ships. Most small-
ship lines offer some kind of early-booking discounts, and sometimes
offer deals on specific sailings. Some lines (especially the sailing-ship
lines) offer very attractive rates and frequent deals. Lastly, remember to
think in terms of the big money picture when weighing the affordability
of these lines: In contrast to most megaship experiences, where you end
up spending hundreds extra on shore excursions and extra-cost onboard
attractions, on small ships you often visit places you can explore on
your own, or where excursions are included.
What Makes the Small Ships Tick
In a word, place — a sense of place, the idea that you’re not just skim-
ming like a rock on water from island to island, collecting a few trinkets
along the way but never really getting a feel for what you’re seeing. On a

small ship you’re down near the waterline, on a vessel small enough that
it can stop for an hour at a small fishing village, or sail up canals and
rivers to historic small towns, or pull up along a coastline to watch a
mama bear and her cubs.
For the most part, activities center around the destination, too, whether
they involve hearing lectures about the region’s history and culture or
just standing on deck with the ship’s resident naturalists, scanning for
whales or rare birds. The larger the vessel, the more likely it is to pro-
gram occasional other activities as well, such as exercise classes, food-
preparation demonstrations, or watersports — the latter sometimes
offered right from the docked ship, via a floating sports platform. Small
ships often include some or all excursions in their rates, too — whether
that’s a visit to an Eskimo village in northern Alaska or a stop at a beach
in the Virgin Islands for barbecue and games.
Meals are usually served in a single dining room, though a few of the
larger small ships also have a small buffet or other secondary option.
Everyone on board is usually able to dine together, and there’s never such
a thing as assigned seats on a small ship — it’s always open-seating. Dress
is always casual: no dress codes here, and hardly anybody ever does
more than a sport jacket or nice dress (if that), even for the captain’s
cocktail party. Service is generally friendly and casual, with staff often cov-
ering several jobs: cabin steward in the morning, waiter by night, and lug-
gage-handler at the beginning and end of the trip. End-of-voyage tipping is
usually done on a pooled basis: You just leave some cash in an envelope,
and the crew splits it between them after you’re gone.
After-dinner entertainment is limited, usually consisting of nothing more
than an ad hoc crew talent show or maybe a musician or two. Some ships
also bring aboard local musicians and dancers when they stay late in
port, and others may use the after-dinner hour for an informal lecture or
to talk about the next day’s port or sailing region.
Because small ships are, by definition, small, your cabin probably won’t
be overly spacious. Some small ships do offer suites or deluxe cabins if
you have a yen for yardage (and the bucks to pay for it), but expect little
variation among cabins on any of these ships. Expect little in the way of
amenities, too: Many small ships don’t have TVs in the cabins, for exam-
ple, and bathrooms are usually very small.
A few things to consider about the small-ship experience:
 Few small ships have stabilizers, so things may get bumpy if you’re
sailing in rough open water. On the other hand, many small ships
stick to protected coastal waters and bays, so open-water sailing
may not be an issue on your itinerary.
 Very few small ships have elevators, so they aren’t a good option
if you have mobility problems.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
226

 With few exceptions, none of the small-ship lines offer room
service. Those that do include Windstar’s ships, Delta Queen’s
ships (limited breakfast menu only), American West’s ships (break-
fast and sometimes dinner for suite passengers only), and Star
Clipper’s Royal Clipper (suite guests only).
 No small ships are really geared toward children, though a few
do offer special family-oriented sailings, and one (Windjammer
Barefoot) offers a children’s program on some sailings.
 Most small ships don’t carry a medical staff on board when sailing
coastal or river itineraries. Instead, any passenger who becomes
seriously ill or injured is evacuated quickly to a medical facility on
shore. Doctors are usually carried on open-sea voyages.

 Type of cruise: Low-key, no-frills river and coastal cruises
 Ship size/style: Small, bare-bones vessels
If you sail this line, you’re guaranteed an unusual, “what you see is what
you get” experience: friendly, homespun, and visiting some places few
other ships go. Extremely informal, these small ships won’t win any
awards for décor (they are, in fact, about the most bare-bones vessels
you can find in terms of amenities, service, and meals), but that’s not
what they’re all about. Instead, this is a line that gets passengers close
to the real life of the regions it visits, whether you want to explore his-
toric American towns, check out fall foliage along the Erie Canal, or play
connect the dots among New England’s islands. The vessels’ unusually
shallow 61⁄2-foot draft combines with other patented innovations to allow
them to sail in narrow, shallow waterways and nudge directly up onto
pristine, dockless shores, disembarking passengers via a ramp that
extends from the bow.
Passengers sailing solo can take advantage of a “Willing to Share” pro-
gram, in which the line pairs you with another solo passenger, thus
avoiding the 175 percent rate you’d pay if booking a cabin just for your-
self. If another solo is not aboard, you get the cabin for the cheaper rate
anyway. On the other side of the spectrum, when three passengers share
one of the ships’ tiny cabins, each gets a 15 percent discount.

Dining
Basic, all-American food is well prepared, folksy, presented by friendly
down-home American crew, and as far away from fancy as you can get.
Meals are an opportunity for passengers to mix and mingle, as dining is
open seating, communal-style for all meals, at tables primarily seating
eight. Each meal has one entrée choice, and anyone wanting an alterna-
tive (such as chicken instead of beef) can be accommodated only if he
or she notifies the kitchen before 10 a.m. Passengers following special
diets can also be accommodated with advance notice.
Occasional theme nights offer dishes from Italy, the Caribbean, the
American West, and other regions, and there’s usually a barbecue on the
top deck at least once per cruise, weather permitting. Tea, coffee, and
hot chocolate are available round the clock, and fresh fruit, snacks, and
fresh-baked cookies and muffins are served between meals.
The line’s BYOB policy is a real money-saving system for passengers — 
a bottle of rum we bought in Panama City, for example, cost less than 
$5 — about the cost of one drink on most ships. Passengers’ beer and
wine are labeled and stored in a cooler near the bar, which also has sep-
arate shelves for liquor bottles. Soft drinks, along with tonic and soda
water, are provided free of charge at the bar. On the first and last night 
of each cruise, hour-long welcome and goodbye parties feature an open
bar (for all drinks but beer) and hors d’oeuvres.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
228

Activities and entertainment
Amusement is mostly of the do-it-yourself variety, such as board 
games, puzzles, cards, reading, and chatting with the other passengers.
Otherwise, you can find occasional informal lectures, a few printed
quizzes, cooking demonstrations, and bridge and galley tours, and that’s
about it. River, canal, and coastal cruises concentrate on visits to histori-
cally rich Colonial ports, plus exploration of the region’s flora and fauna,
with area guides and naturalists leading visits to wildlife sanctuaries and
parks. The amount of time spent at each port varies from a few hours to
an entire morning or afternoon, and the ship usually remains anchored
or docked at night, sometimes allowing passengers to explore restau-
rants and/or nightspots ashore.
Select cruises carry full-time naturalists aboard, but the line does not
consistently have the variety or quality of onboard experts you may find
on more outdoors-oriented lines such as Lindblad.
Evenings, the BYOB cocktail hour is a time for songs, announcements,
and an occasional informal talk about an upcoming sight or experience.
A movie from the ship’s video collection is usually shown after dinner 
on the large-screen TV in the lounge, and local entertainers (such as
Dixieland bands on Mississippi River itineraries) sometimes come
aboard for an evening or perform for passengers in port.
For kids
ACCL is not a family-friendly line, with kids under age 14 prohibited. Teens
older than that had better be pretty good at entertaining themselves or
really intellectually curious to be good candidates for an ACCL trip.
Figure 13-1: Grande Mariner
Fleet facts
The line’s two ships, Grande Mariner (see Figure 13-1) and Grande
Caribe, are the most comfortable and appealing the line has ever built,
but they’re still as basic as cruise ships come, with tiny, spartan cabins
(that means just the basic beds, chairs, and clothing storage, and no
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 229

TVs) and no-fuss décor. As with most small ships, you can find only two
public areas aboard — a dining room large enough for all passengers at
once, and a small lounge furnished with couches and chairs, a large-
screen TV, a bar, board games and puzzles, and a random selection of
books and magazines. During the day, many passengers view the
scenery from the open top deck, which is furnished with deck chairs and
partially covered by a large awning to provide shade. There are also
open decks along the port and starboard sides, a small area in the bow,
and a quiet open area in the stern.

American Safari Cruises

safari.com
 Type of cruise: Adventure/educational, gourmet
 Ship size/style: Small, luxurious yachts
For those who can afford it, American Safari offers truly adventurous
cruises on its fleet of tiny, but very cushy yachts. Carrying only 12 and
22 passengers apiece in plush comfort, the line’s three vessels have
homey lounges, ocean-view hot tubs, and large cabins. Fares include
spirits, wine, and shore excursions (but not tips).
An American Safari cruise is best suited for hands-on types, attracting a
well-traveled group of 40- to 60-somethings. Some days are spent kayak-
ing in the wilderness and others visiting small ports of call, sometimes
overnighting there for a taste of the local nightlife. A passenger-crew
ratio of about two to one ensures that a cold drink, a clever meal, or a
sharp eagle-spotting eye is never more than a request away. During the
day passengers have a lot of flexibility: If some want to kayak and others
want to go wildlife-watching in an inflatable, no problem; your wish is
their command.
Professional naturalists sail on all Alaska, Pacific Northwest, and Baja
itineraries leading off-vessel explorations and answering questions.

Dining
Crewmembers cheerfully fuss over you, adjusting lunchtime dishes and
making elaborate cocktails from the free open bar (they may even call
ahead to the next port for your favorite beer), and the chef indulges
guests with multiple-course meals (cuisine is finer than you may expect
to find on small ships) and clever snacks when he isn’t bartering with a
fishing boat for the catch of the day. All meals are served family-style
and dress is always casual. Special dietary requests can be accommo-
dated with advance notice. Snacks such as Gorgonzola and brie with
pears, walnuts, and table crackers are set out between meals.
Activities and entertainment
If you like staying active on vacation as much as you like being pam-
pered, ASC is surprisingly outdoorsy, with expedition leaders accompa-
nying passengers on off-vessel exploration. In Alaska, you may take out a
Zodiac boat or kayak to investigate shoreline black bears or river otters,
or to navigate fjords packed with ice floes and lolling seals. Expeditions
include trips to boardwalked cannery towns, Tlingit villages, and tiny vil-
lages such as Meyer’s Chuck, population about 50, give or take. Activities
throughout the day are well spaced, and there are many opportunities to
see wildlife.
In California, Wine Country cruises include private tours and tastings.
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 231

The main lounge is the social center of each ship, a place for guests to
relax, listen to an informal lecture by the ship’s naturalist, play a game of
cards or Scrabble, or watch a movie from the ship’s library on the big-
screen TV. From time to time, the ship docks at a town with a measure of
nightlife — at the least, you get to shoot a game of pool; at best, the pas-
sengers all head out together for a pub crawl.
For kids
Most sailings have no programs or facilities whatsoever for kids, but
occasional sailings in Alaska and the Sea of Cortez are targeted to fami-
lies (and called Kids in Nature, or KIN, cruises), with naturalists giving
kids lessons in the region’s flora and fauna. At the end of the trip, kids
get a few “graduation gifts,” including a video documenting their week
on board and a “University of Whales” diploma.
Figure 13-2: Safari Quest
Fleet facts
Safari Escape, Safari Quest (see Figure 13-2), and Safari Spirit resem-
ble private yachts more than cruise ships, and they have the cabins to
match, with televisions, VCRs, and roomy bathrooms with showers (and
a shower-tub combo on the Spirit). The Spirit has the largest cabins, and
after its overhaul in 2005, is considered the most luxurious of the fleet.
The Admiral’s Cabins have large picture windows, a small sitting area,
plus other features such as a cedar-lined sauna or a small balcony (two
cabins have balconies on the Spirit and four on the Quest). Otherwise,
cabins have windows, but those on the lower deck are elevated, meaning
sunlight comes in but you have no view. All public rooms have generous
panoramic views.

 Type of cruise: River, coastal, and open-sea small-ship cruises
 Ship size/style: Mostly casual, coastal cruisers plus one elaborate
oceangoing vessel
Alaska legend Charles “Chuck” West founded Cruise West in the late
1980s to present a genuine and close-up view of Alaska. Today, the com-
pany is still in the West family and its mission remains the same, even
though its geographic reach has expanded to include destinations such
as Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, California’s Wine Country, the rivers of
Oregon and Idaho, Arctic Russia, the South Pacific, and Japan.
Cruise West passengers tend to be older (generally in the upper end of
the 50–75 age range), well educated, independent-minded, and insistent
upon a casual and relaxed onboard atmosphere. Every aspect of the trip
is destination-oriented, with itineraries dividing their time between sail-
ing in gorgeous natural areas and visiting ports of call — both large, pop-
ular ports and smaller, lesser-known ones. Because these ships are
small, they can navigate tight areas and scoot close to wildlife without
causing alarm. When the ship is sailing, many passengers congregate on
the open bow or the open top and side decks to scan for wildlife or just
take in the views.

Dining
All meals are served in single open seatings at each ship’s main restau-
rant, with an early-riser’s buffet also available in the lounge. Cuisine is
fairly average home-style American, varied but not over-fancy. Chefs
make a point of stocking up on fresh seafood while in port. Spirit of
Oceanus has an indoor/outdoor buffet option at breakfast and lunch,
and all ships try to serve at least one lunch and/or dinner outdoors.
Activities and entertainment
The ships provide binoculars for guest use and carry naturalists who
help guests spot and identify wildlife and geological features, usually
announcing sightings over the intercom. Guests, including Forest
Service rangers and members of local tribes, sometimes come aboard to
speak and/or accompany guests in port. Occasionally, expedition lead-
ers take passengers for a spin in the ships’ inflatable launches, getting
close to shore. Kayaking is also available on some itineraries. At least
one shore excursion is included for each port of call, ranging from short
performances or driving tours to full-day odysseys.
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 235

Aside from these destination-oriented activities, the most you can
expect entertainment-wise is an occasional movie screening in the
lounge (and even that is probably destination-oriented) or sometimes a
very silly crew talent show. The larger Spirit of Oceanus has a small gym,
but on the other ships the only exercise option is walking around the
outside deck.
For kids
Cruise West offers no children’s program.
Figure 13-3: Spirit of ’98
Fleet facts
Spirit of Oceanus is one of our very favorite small ships, a spacious
and well-designed vessel with interiors reminiscent of 19th-century
yachts. Wood-paneled staterooms are huge, most with a large sitting
area and extra-large bathroom. Cabins on Sun and Sports Decks trade
interior space for private teak balconies. Public areas include two
lounges, a small gym, an indoor/outdoor buffet restaurant, and an out-
door hot tub.
Spirit of ’98 (see Figure 13-3) is charming, designed to resemble a 19th-
century coastal steamer. There’s even a player piano in the lounge, plus
period-looking balloon-back chairs, decorative pressed-aluminum ceil-
ings, ruffled drapery, and plenty of polished woodwork and brass.
Spirit of Endeavor, Spirit of Nantucket, and Spirit of Yorktown all
previously sailed for Clipper Cruise Line — Endeavor back in the 1980s
and early ’90s, Nantucket and Yorktown until just last year, when Clipper
decided to get out of the coastal cruise business. All three have a low-
key, comfortable feel, with nice, clean styling, cozy cabins, and two
indoor public areas: a dining room and an observation lounge with big
windows, a bar, a small library, and enough space to comfortably seat
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
236
(Photo: Cruise West)

everyone on board for lectures and relaxation. Similar in style is Pacific
Explorer, which offers comfortable cabins as well as a fleet of Zodiacs,
kayaks, snorkel gear, and banana boats for off-vessel exploration and fun
in Central America.
The line’s most unusual itineraries may be those offered by its cabinless
day cruiser Sheltered Seas, which visits Alaska’s great natural areas by
day and then delivers passengers ashore every evening for dinner and a
stay at a local hotel. It’s like a road trip, but without the road. The vessel
is equipped with a dining lounge (and a galley for preparing lunch), a
viewing lounge, a bar, and two outside viewing decks.
Cruise West’s remaining vessels, Spirit of Alaska, Spirit of Columbia,
and Spirit of Discovery, are all utilitarian small ships from the 1970s.
They all offer an intimate cruise experience and the usual small-ship
arrangement of two public rooms (a main lounge and a single dining
room), plus outdoor viewing decks to take in the scenery. Expect cabins,
décor, and design to be spartan.
Spirit of ’98 and Spirit of Oceanus have elevators — a rarity in the small-
ship world. Spirit of ’98 also has one completely wheelchair-accessible
cabin.
See Table 13-6 for fleet specifications. Note that tonnage for Endeavour,
Nantucket, Yorktown, and Oceanus is figured on a different basis than the
other vessels. Passenger capacity provides a better basis for size com-
parison among these ships.

 Type of cruise: Casual, easy, party, and cheap
 Ship size/style: Small, no-frills
easyCruise, a line launched in spring 2005 by UK-based entrepreneur
Stelios Haji-Ioannou (who goes simply by “Stelios” and is the brains
behind easyJet, easyHotel, easyCar, and a dozen other “easy” compa-
nies), has a niche all its own in the cruise business — neither main-
stream, luxury, nor your usual small-ship cruise either. The idea is
actually pretty simple: Throw out everything people expect a cruise to
be and start over.
Accustomed to treating their ship like a home away from home? Not here,
where the ship is just a combo transportation device and sleeping com-
partment. Accustomed to traveling in a bubble, with the cruise line
arranging activities, entertainment, and excursions? Not here, where
you’re completely on your own, with a concierge to suggest the best
restaurants and clubs in port. Accustomed to itineraries that start some-
where, go somewhere, and end up back at the beginning a week or so
later? Not here, where passengers have the option of boarding and dis-
embarking at pretty much any port they like and sailing as many or as
few nights as they want, with the only rule being a minimum two-night
stay. Accustomed to paying a single price for their whole trip, everything
included? Not here, where the rates are per-day and only cover the cabin
charge. Everything else costs extra: meals, daily service by a cabin stew-
ard, and niceties like beach towels. Sound expensive? NOT! easyCruise’s
rates are actually fantastically low, sometimes just $20 to $30 per person,
per day, double occupancy, with all bookings made through the com-
pany’s Web site. And if you feel like traveling at the last minute, you can
book up to 48 hours before sailing as long as cabins are still available.
Essentially, easyCruise is a Eurail Pass for the 25- to 50-year-old set:
cheap, flexible, and easy, and they don’t hold your hand. “I don’t expect
a lot of my customers to spend much time in their cabins,” says Haji-
Ioannou. “This is about making the destination the destination, not 
the ship.”
The line started with one itinerary — a repeating 7-night French and
Italian Riviera loop, sailing round-trip from Nice each Friday, visiting
Cannes and St. Tropez (France); Genoa, Portofino, and Imperia/San
Remo (Italy); and Monaco. By the end of Stelios’ first year, he added a
Caribbean route during the winter; introduced easyCruiseTwo, a 100-pas-
senger riverboat plying the rivers and canals of Holland and Belgium;
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
238

and announced his intention to build two 500-passenger ships in Greece
(with an option for a third and a fourth) for likely port-a-day routes in
the Greek Isles as well as other parts of the Med, Caribbean, Florida and
the Bahamas, and the Middle East. On any of the itineraries, the point is
that passengers may start and end their trip anywhere along the route.
Ports also tend to be close together, so it doesn’t take long for the ship
to get from place to place. That means the ship can stay late and still
make it to the next stop by morning, giving passengers time to enjoy
nightlife until 4 a.m. On the Riviera, you don’t even have to worry about
missing the boat. If you do, just hop on a taxi to catch up.

Dining
Meals are available from three casual areas on board: a tapas bar, a
sports bar with burgers, and an Italian-style cafe. At presstime, the
sports bar was to be transformed into a more upscale venue during a fall
2006 drydock. All meals are charged restaurant-style, with prices listed
on the menu. The expectation is that most passengers dine on shore,
and the ship carries a concierge who can direct passengers to the best
restaurants in each port.
Activities and entertainment
A hot tub, a small workout room, a gift shop, and a DJ in the tapas bar
some evenings — and that’s it.
For kids
None. The easyCruiseOne (see Figure 13-4) is geared to adults, with a
minimum age of 14 (if sharing cabin with someone 18 or over).
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 239

Figure 13-4: easyCruiseOne
Fleet facts
easyCruiseOne, the fledgling line’s first ship, was built in 1990. As part
of its easy-fication, the ship’s hull, cabins, and public areas were painted
orange and white (the official colors of all “easy” companies); its interior
walls were moved to fit more cabins (increasing its passenger load from
114–170); and its cabin windows were sealed over, creating rooms that
really are just places to sleep. Average cabin size is a tiny 100 square
feet, with four larger staterooms at 258 square feet. Cabins have platform
beds and a private bathroom with shower, but not much else.
At press time, easyCruiseOne was scheduled for an October, 2006, dry-
dock to make some adjustments in a few areas the line found lacking
after a year in service. Look for a new paint job to cover up most of the
shocking orange hull with a more traditional dark grey, and cabins are to
be redesigned and “de-oranged.”
Few details were available at press time about easyCruiseTwo, which
formerly sailed as the M.S. Frontera. The 100-passenger vessel is owned
and operated by Boonstra River Line and will be operated as a franchise
of easyCruise.

INTRAV/Clipper Cruise Line
11969 Westline Industrial Dr., St. Louis, MO 63146-3220; % 800-456-8100; www.
intrav.com
 Type of cruise: World-ranging open-sea small-ship cruises
 Ship size/style: Small oceangoing vessels
The Clipper Cruise Line of today is not the Clipper Cruise Line of just one
year ago. In January 2006, the line sold its two older coastal cruisers,
Nantucket Clipper and Yorktown Clipper, leaving it with two exploratory
ships that sail itineraries from the Scandinavian Arctic to Antarctica, 
from the South Pacific to Siberia — as well as Western Europe, the
Mediterranean, the Norwegian Fjords, the British Isles, Iceland,
Greenland, the Adriatic, Aegean, the Black Sea, South America, North
Africa, Vietnam, China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Australia/New
Zealand, and Alaska. Ownership changes are also leading to some iden-
tity issues, but at press time we’d just found out that the line would grad-
ually be phasing out the name Clipper and going instead by the name of
its immediate parent company, INTRAV (probably as something like
“Expedition Cruising by INTRAV”), though it will offer the same basic
range of cruises that Clipper did to the North American market, and offer
a similar experience.
Naturalists, historians, and other experts sail on all itineraries to offer
informal lectures and lead expeditions to sites of interest. Stops at the
ports may also include a guided hike in a wildlife preserve or along the
coast, a museum visit, swimming and snorkeling, and other options.
Despite how adventurous these destinations and itineraries might
sound, these cruises are hardly about roughing it. Instead, they repre-
sent low-fuss vacations for low-fuss people who want to know something
about the places they visit. The line caters to mature, casual, relatively
affluent, and well-traveled older passengers (average age 69) who want a
vacation experience heavy on nature, history, and culture. It’s an ideal
choice for travelers who’ve sailed the mainstream or premium lines and
want to try a small-ship cruise.
For INTRAV/Clipper’s itineraries and sample fares, see Table 13-9.

Dining
INTRAV/Clipper’s cuisine is generally straightforward, prepared by chefs
from the Culinary Institute of America. Though not terribly adventurous
(beyond using local ingredients wherever possible), it’s very well pre-
pared, focusing on meat, seafood, and pasta. All meals are served in the
main dining room, and light breakfast and lunch items are served buffet-
style in a public lounge. Weather and time permitting, a barbecue is on
deck at least once per weeklong cruise. There’s no dress code.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
242

Activities and entertainment
As aboard the other small-ship lines, INTRAV/Clipper’s activities all
revolve around the ships’ destinations, with most days spent in port or
sailing beautiful natural or historical areas. In the evenings, resident natu-
ralists and historians deliver informal lectures, which on our last cruise
included talks on nature and geology, reef fish identification, and plant life.
For kids
The line offers no children’s programs.
Figure 13-5: Clipper Adventurer
Fleet facts
Both INTRAV/Clipper vessels are substantial ships built for expeditionary
ocean voyages.
Clipper Adventurer (see Figure 13-5) is one of our very favorite ships,
large or small. Its interior (all new after Clipper bought the ship in 1998)
is almost plush on the inside, in a clubby, comfortable, seagoing way.
Outside, though, Adventurer is tough as nails, with an ice-hardened 
hull that allows it to sail exotic itineraries in the Arctic and Antarctica.
Adventurer covers all of Clipper’s itineraries in the Atlantic, Europe,
South America, and Antarctica.
Clipper Odyssey holds the fort on the Pacific the way Adventurer 
does in the Atlantic, covering all the line’s Asia, South Seas, Russia, and
Australia/New Zealand itineraries. Sleek and yachtlike, she offers more
than the average small ship, including two lounges, a library, a small
pool, an elevator, and even a jogging track. All cabins have sitting areas
with sofas, and eight deluxe cabins and one suite boast private verandas.

Lindblad Expeditions
96 Morton St., New York, NY 10014; % 800-397-3348; www.expeditions.com
 Type of cruise: Small-ship adventure/educational cruises
 Ship size/style: Coastal and open-sea expedition vessels
Lindblad Expeditions specializes in environmentally sensitive soft-
adventure cruises, offering an experience more oriented toward real
exploration than any other line. It’s our top pick for trips to real adven-
ture destinations such as Antarctica and the Galapagos, and it also offers
great adventure trips in closer locales, such as Baja and Alaska.
Lindblad’s cruises are truly exploratory in nature. Most days are spent
off the ship aboard Zodiac boats and/or on land excursions, finding out
about the destinations first-hand, with a team of four to five naturalists,
an historian, and an undersea specialist along to help you understand
what you’re seeing. That’s the highest number of experts carried by any
of the small-ship lines. As part of a 2004 agreement with the National
Geographic Society, Geographic scientists, photographers, and film
crews sail aboard many of Lindblad’s voyages, providing guests with an
enhanced experience but also conducting actual research on land and
undersea. The line’s most adventure-oriented vessel was rechristened
National Geographic Endeavour and fitted with advanced research equip-
ment, and an advisory group from the Geographic Society helps develop
research, conservation, and educational initiatives for the Lindblad fleet.
Passengers tend to be physically active as well as intellectually curious
and are generally in the over-55 range. They’re also the types who can
afford Lindblad’s high rates, though the inclusive nature of the product
makes those prices a little easier to swallow. Shore excursions are all
included, for example, as is airfare on some itineraries and sailing dates.

Dining
Hearty buffet breakfasts and lunches and sit-down dinners often reflect
regional culture and tastes, made from local, seasonal ingredients pur-
chased in ports along the way, as part of Lindblad’s commitment to 
promoting sustainable agriculture and fishing practices. On some 
itineraries — for instance, in Mexico’s Sea of Cortez and on Costa Rica’s
Osa Peninsula — Lindblad offers cookouts after days full of hiking, kayak-
ing, and snorkeling. A typical menu in Mexico is grilled fish from local
waters, handmade tortillas, tomatillo salsa, and a selection of Baja wines.
Activities and entertainment
While on board, passengers entertain themselves with the usual small-
ship activities: wildlife watching, reading, and attending onboard lec-
tures and slide presentations by resident naturalists and National
Geographic experts. Each evening, the naturalists lead discussions
recapping the day’s events, and after dinner, a documentary or feature
film may be screened in the main lounge. In some regions, local musi-
cians may come aboard to entertain.
All ships carry exploration essentials such as Zodiac landing craft, sea
kayaks, snorkeling gear, wet suits, and other low- and high-tech under-
water equipment. The Sea Voyager has a small fitness room.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
246

For kids
None of the Lindblad ships has any organized children’s programs, but
all Alaska, Costa Rica/Nicaragua, and Galapagos sailings have staff that
has been trained in childhood and environmental education.
Figure 13-6: Sea Lion
Fleet facts
National Geographic Endeavour is Lindblad’s flagship and also the
flagship of its partnership with the National Geographic Society. Built
tough, with a reinforced hull and stabilizers to enable sailing in rough
regions from the Arctic to the Antarctic, the vessel is also sizable and
comfortable, with niceties such as a fitness center, sauna, small swim-
ming pool, wood-paneled library, and even a hair salon, in addition to
the usual main lounge and dining room. Cabins are sufficiently roomy.
Cabins on the upper deck have picture windows but those on the lower
decks make due with portholes — which is just fine except during rough
seas, when the porthole covers are bolted shut for safety reasons. Two
suites on the upper deck have separate sleeping and living areas.
The smaller, shallow-draft Sea Lion (see Figure 13-6) and Sea Bird are
identical twins, right down to their décor schemes and furniture. Both
ships have two public rooms (the observation lounge/bar and the dining
room) and all cabins are outsides, with picture windows that open to let
in breezes and fresh air.
The cabins, dining room, and lounge area on the Sea Voyager are almost
plush by expedition standards. The Polaris is a homey expedition ship
with a classic seagoing look, full of polished wood and brass, with teak
decking and a comfortably laid-back vibe. Public areas include the main
lounge, single dining room, and a cozy library, as well as a covered out-
side deck with chairs and tables. Cabins are all outsides with windows
or (on A Deck) portholes. The Islander is a sturdy twin-hulled vessel
designed for year-round service in the Galapagos, with all outside cabins
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 247

and a comfortable lounge and dining room. Lord of the Glens is a lovely
little 54-passenger yacht that operates cruises in the Scottish Highlands,
while Sea Cloud II is a beautiful sailing ship Lindblad has begun to char-
ter from Sea Cloud Cruises for trips in the Caribbean and Europe.

com
 Type of cruise: Adventure/educational, rustic
 Ship size/style: Classic schooners
The Maine Windjammer Association isn’t a cruise line at all, but rather a
marketing group for 14 owner-operated classic schooners, some dating
as far back as 1871. All of them sail — and we do mean sail, using sail
power exclusively or almost exclusively — in and around mid-Maine’s
Penobscot Bay from late May to mid-October, providing an absolutely
perfect way to see one of the country’s most beautiful stretches of coast.
This is one of the greatest small-ship experiences you can get — and the
prices are right, too.
With no engines (on most vessels), little electricity, and only the most
basic accommodations, these ships offer their passengers the chance to
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
248

get off the grid for a while, away from mechanized society and constant
bustle. Days are filled with the demands of sailing (which passengers
can help out with if they choose), walks around quaint Maine towns,
quiet reading time on deck, and sometimes an impromptu race with one
of the other schooners. Service, such as it is, is provided by the same
folks who trim the sails and keep the boat on course — which means
you shouldn’t expect much beyond a set of fresh sheets when you
board. They’re terrifically friendly, though.
Typical passengers run the gamut, age-wise, though most tend to fall
between 30 and 80. A huge percentage are repeaters, with some return-
ing to vacation on the same schooner year after year. They’re individual-
ists, sometimes luddites, and most are well-educated.
You can request information for all ships from the preceding address and
phone number and get basic information on the individual schooners
(and links to their Web pages) through the association Web site. Actual
bookings must be made directly with the captain of each schooner.
Many of the schooners offer early-booking rates during their winter off-
season. Check their individual Web sites for details. As an additional
cost-saver, all the ships are BYOB, providing coolers and ice with which
passengers can chill their beer, wine, or whatever.
For more information on itineraries and rates, check out Table 13-13.

Whole fleet
2- to 6-night Maine coastal cruises: The whole fleet sails 
$140 inside/outside; 
from Rockland, Rockport, and Camden, ME, late May 
no suites
through mid-Oct.
Dining
Fleetwide, meals are prepared on wood stoves in rustic galleys and
served out on deck, picnic style. Expect traditional New England staples
such as fresh seafood, chowder, roasts, and Irish soda bread. Dinners
often coincide with sunset, making a beautiful tableau. In inclement
weather, all passengers pack into the galley for meals. Once per cruise,
most of the ships disembark passengers onto a quiet, rocky beach for a
traditional lobster bake.
Activities and entertainment
Aside from sailing itself, and visiting small Maine islands and towns by
launch, there’s not much. On many ships the captain and/or members of
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 249

the crew are musicians, and will perform in the evenings. Passengers
may also bring along acoustic instruments.
For kids
None of the Windjammers have kids’ programs, and many actively dis-
courage children from sailing. Most have minimum age requirements
ranging from 10 to 16, though Timberwind (see Figure 13-7) accepts chil-
dren as young as 5, and Isaac H. Evans accepts kids as young as 6. Most
ships make exceptions for children of past passengers.
Figure 13-7: Timberwind
Fleet facts
The Maine Windjammer Association includes classic vessels more than
130 years old as well as newer vessels created in a traditional style.
Many vessels are either listed on the National Register or designated a
National Historic Landmark; the oldest (Lewis R. French and Stephen
Taber) date from 1871, and the youngest (Angelique) launched in 1980.
You can find out more details about each individual schooner through

Majestic America Line
2101 Fourth Ave., Suite 1150, Seattle, WA 98121; % 800-434-1232; www.majestic
americaline.com
 Type of cruise: Nostalgic river cruises
 Ship size/style: Five beautifully-designed sternwheelers (one an
original from the 1920s, the others larger recreations), plus one
stray coastal cruiser
The year 2006 was like the Old West in the paddle-wheeler business,
with both the venerable Delta Queen Steamboat Company and the
younger American West Steamboat Company sold to Ambassadors
International, a California-based firm that offers travel and event-man-
agement services for corporations, associations, and tradeshows.
Ambassadors quickly set up a cruise sub-brand, Ambassadors Cruise
Group, LLC, and hired industry veteran David Giersdorf (formerly of
Holland America and Windstar) to serve as president and COO. At this
writing, the company had only just announced the merger of the two
lines under a new brand name, Majestic America Line, so information
wasn’t available regarding some planned details of operation. We’re
going to go out on a limb, though, and bet that the new line will more
closely resemble Delta Queen, the brand with the longer and more suc-
cessful history.
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 251

Corporate machinations aside, and based on the experiences previously
offered by DQ and American West, we can confidently state that this is
the line to sail with it you want to cruise like Mark Twain. All five of the
line’s paddle-wheelers offer a time-travel option that re-creates what it
was like to sail America’s rivers back in the old days. The small, wooden
Delta Queen was actually there. Built in 1927, she’s a direct link to the
old days, and even has National Historic Landmark status. The larger
Mississippi Queen and American Queen (see Figure 13-8) were built in
1976 and 1995, respectively, and offer a combination of old-style décor
and a few cruise ship amenities. All sail the various branches of the
Mississippi River system.
Queen of the West and Empress of the North, which sailed previously
for American West, are also modern vessels designed after the great pad-
dlewheel riverboats of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Both offer
an experience heavy on history and charm, taking passengers back in
time while sailing Alaska’s Inside Passage and the Pacific Northwest’s
Columbia and Snake Rivers.
On board all five sternwheel ships, the main activity is watching the
river go by and finding out about the regions visited. On the Mississippi,
porch swings and rocking chairs provide the best perches out on deck,
and when it’s time to go ashore, the boat may just tie up to a tree and let
passengers off right on the river’s edge. Who needs a pier?
All around, Majestic America offers more lavish décor and better food
and service than you can find on most of the other ships discussed in
this chapter, and its boats have an intimacy and personality that bigger
cruise ships lack. The accommodations are plush, the atmosphere one
of nostalgia, and the onboard artwork a feast of Americana. Guests —
mostly early-to-bed types between ages 65 and 70 (though there are
sometimes extended families with kids cruising together) — are
attracted by the ships’ historic feel and are equally interested in the his-
tory of the regions visited.
Note: The line’s one non-sternwheeler, the 49-passenger Executive
Explorer, is a small, speedy catamaran that formerly sailed for Glacier
Bay Cruiseline. At press time no details were available concerning how
she’ll be slotted into the Majestic America operation.

Dining
Based on experience with Delta Queen, we expect Majestic America will
continue to serve some of the most varied and tasty menus among the
small-ship lines, with cuisine tilted toward regional American dishes
depending on the sailing region (Southern, Cajun, middle-American, and
so on). Meals are served in traditional style, with passengers assigned to
a set table for lunch and dinner. On the Mississippi, expect dishes such
as crab-stuffed catfish, seafood gumbo, prime rib, Mississippi Mud Pie,
and maybe even fried alligator at a late-night buffet.
Activities and entertainment
Aboard the former Delta Queen ships, finding out about the Mississippi
and its tributaries is the focus of most days, with the onboard historian
offering both formal talks and less formal interaction — describing pass-
ing areas, showing you where you are on a chart, and so on. Other low-
key activities include film screenings, calliope concerts (each boat has
one), and kite flying from the top deck. In the evenings, Delta Queen’s
entertainment program is heavy on Dixieland jazz and swing. Because 
of Louisiana state law, currently no casinos are on any of the vessels.
On the former American West vessels, guest lecturers come aboard to
talk about the history and culture of the areas through which the ships
sail, and if you don’t feel like showing up in person, you can listen to the
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
254

talks in your cabin, via an audio feed. In the evening, the main lounge
programs various small-scale entertainments, including jazz soloists,
small song-and-dance revues, and occasional movie screenings.
For kids
Mississippi Queen and American Queen have offered summer and holiday
“riverbonding” cruises in past years, offering activities for the whole
family as well as unplugged kids’ activities such as knot tying. Neither
the Delta Queen nor the former American West ships offer any kind of
activities or facilities for kids.
Figure 13-8: American Queen
Fleet facts
Built in 1927 for service between San Francisco and Sacramento, Delta
Queen is an authentic river steamboat, oozing personality from the
fluted columns and potted plants of her Cabin Lounge to the polished
brass and gauges of its engine room. Victorian and period American fur-
nishings fill its several lounges, its Orleans Room restaurant, and its
cabins, which feature stained-glass windows, acres of wood paneling,
and (in most cases) doors that open up directly onto the Promenade
Decks, with rocking chairs just outside.
American Queen and Mississippi Queen are much larger vessels built
to offer a period feel as well as modern amenities such as plunge pools,
a gym, and private balconies. The largest sternwheeler in history,
American Queen was designed on a grand scale, full of filigree and
curlicue ornamentation and crowned with two huge fluted smokestacks.
Mississippi Queen was, amazingly enough, designed by the same archi-
tect who created Cunard’s Queen Elizabeth 2 in the 1960s. She was given
a new Victorian interior in 1996, with a trompe l’oeil ceiling hovering
over her grand staircase and period furnishings in her public rooms,
such as the Paddlewheel Lounge (with views from two-story windows)
and the Wheel House, where passengers can read the charts to track
their progress on the river.
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 255

Then there are the two former American West ships. Queen of the West,
the smaller of the line’s two ships, was built in 1995 and has operated in the
Columbia and Snake Rivers ever since. Its bigger sister, Empress of the
North, debuted in 2003. The two ships are more spacious than you may
think when you first see them from shore, with public rooms that evoke
a bygone era. Our favorite is definitely the Paddlewheel Lounge, where
you can sip a cocktail to the thrum of the huge propulsion wheel, visible
through the room-wide window at the back. Snacks are served here
before dinner. Both ships are fitted with bow landing ramps, which let
them cozy up to shore so passengers can walk easily on and off the
vessel, even in secluded spots that lack docking facilities. All cabins on
both ships are decorated like cozy bedrooms, with dark wood tones,
flowery bedspreads, and lace curtains. The majority of suites and state-
rooms have verandas, the rest large picture windows.

 Type of cruise: Adventure/educational, romantic
 Ship size/style: Classic-style sailing ships
Wanna play pirate without roughing it? These three replicas of 19th-
century clipper ships have the sails and rigging of classic tall ships, but
also the creature comforts of today. Pools, a piano bar and deck bar, a
bright and pleasant dining room serving tasty food, and a clubby, wood-
paneled library balance out the swashbuckling spirit. Royal Clipper also
boasts a gym, a small spa, and marble bathrooms.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
256

Passengers are an international mix of active, intelligent 30- to 60-some-
things with a penchant for the sea. The vibe is casual and chatty, and
you’re free to explore, whether climbing the masts (with a harness, of
course), helping raise the sails, crawling into the bow netting, or chat-
ting with the captain on the open-air bridge. Of course you can choose
to do nothing but sunbathe, sip cold drinks at the bar, or listen to the
captain’s daily talk about the next port of call, the history of sailing, or
some other nautical subject. When you cruise into a port, whether
Bequia or Langkawi, you feel like you’re on ships that belong there (as
opposed to those big white megaships barreling into port).
These ships aren’t just pretty to look at; they’re a treasure for old salts
and history buffs. Mikael Krafft, the wealthy Swedish-born businessman
who built the three ships, spared little expense to create the replicas. For
the Star Flyer and Star Clipper, Krafft procured original drawings and speci-
fications of Scottish-born Donald McKay, a leading naval architect of 19th-
century clipper-ship technology, and employed his own team of naval
architects to solve such engineering problems as adapting the square-
rigged, four-masted clipper design to modern materials and construction.
In mid-2000, Krafft went a step further, launching the Royal Clipper, a five-
masted, fully rigged sailing ship inspired by the famed Preussen, a German
clipper built in 1902. The Royal Clipper now claims the title of the largest
clipper ship in the world, and is considered the tallest and among the
fastest clipper ships ever built — they’re a stunning sight.

Dining
The food is tasty, though don’t expect gourmet. All meals are open seat-
ing, with tables for four, six, and eight in the restaurant; the dress code is
always casual (though some guests don jackets on the night of the cap-
tain’s cocktail party). Breakfast and lunch are served buffet style and are
the best meals of the day. The continental cuisine reflects the line’s large
European clientele and is dominated at breakfast and lunch by cheeses,
as well as marinated fish and meats. Breakfasts also include a hot-and-
cold buffet spread and an omelet station. Late-afternoon snacks served
at the Tropical Bar include such munchies as crudités, cheeses, and
chicken wings.
Friendly waiters serve sit-down dinners. Menus typically offer five main
entree choices, plus appetizers, soup, salad, and dessert courses. Only
the Royal Clipper offers 24-hour room service, and only for passengers
staying in the 14 suites and Owner’s Suites.
Activities and entertainment
For most people, just being on these ships is entertainment enough.
Enjoying the sailing experience and socializing with fellow passengers
and crewmembers is the main activity, as it is on most any ship this size.
That, plus the ships are in port every single day, with few exceptions, so
boredom is hardly an issue. Still there are a few things scheduled,
including informal talks by the captain on maritime themes, and, at least
once a day, the cruise director gives a brief spiel about the upcoming
ports and shipboard events (if we had one complaint, it would be these
talks aren’t meaty enough). Weather and conditions permitting, passen-
gers can lend a hand with deck duties, climb the masts, and have a token
try at handling the wheel.
Each ship maintains an open-bridge policy, allowing passengers to wander
up to the humble-looking navigation center at any hour of the day or night
(you may have to ask to actually go into the chart room, though).
There may also be a brief engine-room tour, morning exercise classes on
deck, ever-popular excursions via tender to photograph the ship under
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
258

sail, and hanging out by the pools (three on Royal Clipper, two on Star
Clipper). On all three ships, you can borrow DVDs from the library or
watch the movies that are shown each day on cabin TVs in English,
German, and French.
Activities in port revolve around beaches and watersports, and all are
complimentary, including snorkeling, water-skiing, windsurfing, sailing,
and banana boat rides. For an extra fee, the ships offer PADI-approved
scuba diving, including resort instruction.
After-dinner entertainment takes place nightly by the open-air Tropical
Bar, and runs the gamut from a crew talent show to a trivia contest,
dance games, or a performance by local entertainers (such as a steel-
drum band) who come on board for the evening. A keyboard player
(who seems out of place on ships like these) is on hand to sing pop
songs before and after dinner. Most nights, disco music is put on the
sound system and a section of the deck serves as an impromptu dance
floor, with the action usually quieting down by about 1 a.m.
Ships tend to depart from their ports early so that they can be under 
full sail during sunset. Trust us on this one: nothing is more romantic.
Position yourselves at the ship’s rail or dawdle over drinks at the deck
bar to watch the sun melt into the horizon behind the silhouetted ships’
masts and ropes. If only every day of your life was this good.
For kids
Not a line for young kids (though the line has no age restrictions). No
supervised activities are planned, and no babysitting is available unless a
crewmember agrees to volunteer his or her off-duty hours. The exception
is during holiday seasons such as Christmas, when families are accom-
modated and some children’s activities are organized by the watersports
staff, including treasure hunts, beach games, and arts and crafts. For well-
behaved, intellectually curious kids over 10 or 12, a Star Clippers cruise
any time of the year could be a fun and educational experience.
Figure 13-9: Star Clipper

Fleet facts
Décor on Star Clippers ships is conservative, with touches of mahogany
and brass. Public rooms on the Star Clipper (see Figure 13-9) and Star
Flyer are comfortable and almost cushy. Cabins are small (but okay for 
a ship of this size), and the teak Sun Deck space gives you much more
room to spread out and enjoy the sea breeze than what you can usually
find on small ships.
The Royal Clipper’s cabins are larger and have marble bathrooms and
nautical décor, plus you can find 14 veranda suites with butler service.
Royal has a small gym, spa, and larger, more plush restaurant.

 Ship size/style: Old-style sailing ships
Weee whoooo, these ships sure are fun. Ultracasual (shorts and T-shirts
are the order of every day — even at dinner and at the bar) and refresh-
ingly carefree, leave your inhibitions (and your shoes) at home. This
eclectic fleet of cozy, rebuilt sailing ships lures passengers into a fantasy
world of pirates-and-rum-punch adventure. With the sails flapping above
the ample wooden decks, you feel like you’re a glorious million miles
from reality. Passengers and crew mingle on the cozy decks and bond
over free rum swizzles and homemade snacks at happy hour. The cute
captains come right out of Central Casting, with their deep tans, shorts,
and sunglasses, while passengers are an all-ages mix of eccentric non-
conformists attracted to the totally unpretentious vibe, low rates, and
cloak of adventure.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
260

Windjammer strays off the beaten track when at all possible. The closest
thing you get to a good old-fashioned Caribbean adventure, the ships
head for quiet, out-of-the-way Caribbean islands such as Bequia, Les
Saintes, and Jost van Dyke, places that couldn’t be further away from 
the commercial tourist fray. The ships are ultra-informal and hokey, yet
endearing rituals make the experience feel like summer camp for adults.
Sure the cabins are closet-sized, but you pay way less for a Windjammer
cruise than you would on Star Clippers and Windstar, and bar drinks are
a steal. Plus, one child between 6 and 11 sails free May through early
August when sharing a cabin with parents.

* The fact is, nobody — not even Windjammer’s staff — seems to know exactly where the
line’s ships go, at least not very far ahead of time. But really, it doesn’t matter: The islands are
always small and beautiful, and the ambience is always wacky. We were aboard for a week
once and couldn’t remember where we’d been when we got home. We still aren’t sure, but
we do know we had a great time. A company spokeswoman told us this is fairly common.
Dining
Elbows are allowed and so are bathing suits; just try and remember to
say please when you’re asking for another hunk of bread. Family style
and informal, there’s nothing gourmet about the food, though usually it’s
tasty enough. All breads and pastries are homemade, and at the two
open dinner seatings, after soup and salad are served, passengers can
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 261

choose from two main entrees, such as curried shrimp and roast pork
with garlic sauce. Breakfasts and lunches are typically served buffet
style. At certain islands, the crew lugs ashore a picnic lunch for an after-
noon beach party, and each sailing usually includes one evening on-deck
barbecue. The chef accommodates special diets, including vegetarian
and low-salt. And don’t be shy if it’s your birthday: The chef will make
you a free cake and serve it at dinner.
Bloody Marys are free at breakfast, and each evening at about 5 p.m.,
gallons of complimentary rum swizzles are dispensed along with hors
d’oeuvres that may include homemade plantain chips and salsa or
cheese and crackers. Guests gather on deck, mingling in the fresh sea 
air as island music plays in the background.
Activities and entertainment
In a nutshell, goofy. (And just our cup of tea!) It all starts with the
Captain’s “Story Time” each morning, where the boss offers a rundown
of the day’s schedule with some ribald jokes thrown in for good meas-
ure. Passengers are trained to lovingly shout back “Good morning,
Captain SIR!” Then there’s that beloved Windjammer tradition, the
weekly costume party. Passengers (along with the captain and crew) get
all decked out as cross-dressers, pirates, and other characters. Just
about everything happens on the top open decks, including a passenger
talent show and a local band brought on for the evening. Plus, the ships
often stay late in one or two ports so that passengers can head ashore to
an island watering hole.
Aside from all the free drinks, you can also buy ’em for peanuts: just $3
for an imported brew and $5 for a piña colada.
By day, you’re likely to wander around some port or sunbathe on deck
(or sleep off a hangover). A few inane activities may be offered on deck
late mornings and late afternoons, from crab races to a knot-tying demo.
If conditions are right and the captain amenable, passengers can jump
overboard, literally, and go for a swim after the ship is anchored off-
shore. Just about every day is spent in port somewhere. Generally at
least once per cruise, on one of the ships’ beach visits — to Jost Van
Dyke, perhaps — beach games are arranged and sometimes a barbeque
or organized hike around the island. You can also rent snorkeling or
scuba gear (and sign up for lessons, too).
Of course there’s nothing better to do on a Windjammer cruise than
cuddle with your special someone and watch a dreamy sunset melt into
the horizon. What’s more romantic than the swoosh swoosh swoosh of a
sailing ship slicing through the sea, elbows on the railings and cold beer
in hand?
If you’re unattached, Windjammer offers about six wild-and-crazy singles
cruises a year, plus a handful of other theme cruises every year. The line
also occasionally charters its ships for gays, nudists, Parrot Heads, and
other groups.

For kids
For curious kids with a love of the outdoors, Windjammer can work for
families with older kids (no children under 6 are allowed to sail aboard
any of the ships). The Legacy and Polynesia, and have a “Junior Jammers”
kids’ program for ages 6 to 17 that can draw as many as 40 kids a cruise
in the summer. There are youth counselors for two main age groups
(6–11 and 12–17) who supervise a roster of complimentary summer-
camp-style activities all day. Though there aren’t any organized activities
on Mandalay and Yankee Clipper, teens may enjoy the experience if
they’re the kind that can part with e-mail and cellphones for a week.
There is no babysitting of any kind.
Unlike most megaship lines, which require passengers to be at least 21
years old unless accompanied by parents, Windjammer’s minimum unac-
companied age is 17 and the drinking age is 18.
Figure 13-10: Yankee Clipper
Fleet facts
The Legacy, Mandalay, Polynesia, and Yankee Clipper (see 
Figure 13-10) are all tall ships that operate by a combination of sail 
and engine power. At press time, the Amazing Grace, best described 
as a motorized banana boat, was laid up indefinitely.
The sailing ships are rustic — all polished rails, brass trimmings, and
well-trod teak decks — and chances are you may grow quite attached to
yours by week’s end despite the close quarters below decks. Each ship
has a single dining room, but all other onboard activities are out on the
roomy open decks and the open-air bars. Cabins are tiny and offer no
frills; many have bunk-style beds (the Polynesia and Legacy even have
some four-passenger dorm-style cabins); and miniscule bathrooms with
showers. The Legacy, which is much larger and more modern than the
other ships, has somewhat larger cabins and bathrooms, wider corri-
dors, and a small television room/library that gets little use.

 Type of cruise: Romantic, adventure, gourmet
 Ship size/style: Modern, smallish ships with sails (and engines, too)
It’s simple: If you’re looking for a high-end sailing ship experience that
manages to be casual and down-to-earth, yet also elegant in a yachty
sort of way, Windstar’s for you. The food and service are really good,
cabins are very comfortable, and the ships hit a lot of great out-of-the-
way ports of call. Are you in love yet? We are. As you see a Windstar ship
approaching port, with its long, graceful hull and masts the height of 20-
story buildings, you forget all about the giant megaships moored nearby
and think, Now that’s a ship.
The sailing ship thing is always romantic, and Windstar is particularly
hot. Lounge by the pool under full sails as the ship cuts through the surf
to the next port of call. Retire to your cabin and enjoy room service or
just drinks from the minibar. Have a cocktail under the stars, then enjoy
chef Joachim Splichal’s delicious cuisine in open-seating restaurants
where you can always get a cozy table for two. No wonder Windstar’s so
popular with honeymooners.
The sophisticated, well-traveled crowd who’s attracted to Windstar
appreciates the line’s classic, nautical surroundings, all stained teak,
brass details, and navy-blue fabrics. And while the ships’ tall masts and
white sails cut a traditional profile, they’re also ultra-state-of-the-art,
controlled by a computer so that they can be furled or unfurled at the
touch of a button (though the ships’ diesel engines are used often too).
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships

Beyond “don’t wear shorts in the dining rooms,” there’s no real dress
code here, and most men don’t even bother with a sport jacket at dinner.
The Windstar crowd, a casually elegant group of 30- to 60-somethings,
wouldn’t want to vacation any other way.
The line operates under a tipping-not-required policy, although generally
guests do tip staff as much as on other ships.

Dining
Great cuisine is a high point of a Windstar cruise, and you can find it
offered in two or three open-seating, always-casual restaurants on board
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 265

the line’s three ships. The cuisine here was created by award-winning
chef/restaurateur Joachim Splichal, of Los Angeles’ Patina. His yummy
dishes are straightforward, yet incorporate regional touches and sur-
prising twists. The wine list is also impressive. Vegetarian dishes and
healthy “Sail Light” choices are available for breakfast, lunch, and
dinner; fat and calorie content is listed on the menu.
Restaurants aboard all three ships are set up with an unusual number of
tables for two, proving that Windstar is serious about its romantic image.
There’s rarely a wait, either.
Generous spreads at breakfast and lunch are available at the buffet-style
Veranda on all three ships. Windstar’s largest ship, Wind Surf, also offers
alternative dining at the casual, 128-seat Bistro, an intimate space with a
pretty garden motif and slightly more eclectic menu choices. Reservations
are required, but there’s no additional fee.
The once-a-week evening barbecues on the Pool Decks of Star and Spirit
are wonderful parties under the stars, with a beautifully designed buffet
spread and (often) a Caribbean-style band adding ambience. On Wind
Surf, there’s a gala buffet dinner once per cruise in the main lounge, and
all three ships also offer weekly barbeque lunches on deck.
The ships’ pool bars offer pizza and hot dogs afternoons, and the 24-
hour room service includes the standards plus seafood and steaks from
11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; during restaurant hours you can have anything from
the restaurant’s menu served in your cabin.
Activities and entertainment
You can find zippo rah-rah activities, keeping days loose and languid:
explore ashore (the itineraries visit a port almost every day) or kick
back and relax aboard ship without a lot of distraction. The few things
scheduled during the day include ho-hum stuff such as casino gaming
lessons, walk-a-mile and stretch classes on deck, and maybe a vegetable-
carving demo.
At ports where the ships anchor offshore, passengers can enjoy compli-
mentary kayaking, sailing, water-skiing, snorkeling, windsurfing, and
banana-boat rides, all from a watersports platform that’s lowered from
the stern, weather and sea conditions permitting. For a fee, you can also
go scuba diving. You can also swim off of the platform on Wind Spirit and
Star, though not on the larger Wind Surf. Up top, the Pool Deck offers a
small pool and hot tub, deck chairs, and an open-air bar.
Come evenings, the low-key Windstar crowd enjoys dinner and pre and
post cocktails. Several musicians are aboard each sailing to provide
tunes for evening dancing and background. Most evenings, passengers
either retire to their cabins; head for the modest casino; or go up to the
pool bar for a nightcap under the stars. Sometimes after 10 or 11 p.m.,
disco/pop music is played in the lounge if guests are in a dancing mood,
and once per cruise there’s a crew talent show.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
266

The ships each maintain an open-bridge policy, so at most times you’re
free to walk right in to chat with the captain and officers on duty.
If you consider a massage to be an important cruise activity, you’ll love
the Wind Surf. Considering its intimate, 308-passenger size, she has a
surprisingly large and well-accoutered spa facility, totally outclassing
most facilities on other similar-size ships. The ship’s totally glass-walled
ocean-view gym and separate aerobics room are also as good as it gets
on a small ship.
For kids
As you may expect, these are not kiddy ships. There are no organized
activities or playrooms. The kids that do appear aboard are generally
age 10 and up (the official age minimum is 2), but there are rarely more
than six or seven kids on any sailing, and those only during school
breaks. The ships’ DVD libraries stock some children’s films.
Figure 13-11: Wind Spirit
Fleet facts
Although Windstar ships have tens of thousands of square feet of
Dacron flying from their masts, they operate as smoothly as the very
best modern yachts, owing to the computers that control the sails and
stabilizers. Wind Spirit (see Figure 13-11) and Wind Star are identical,
with all outside cabins (featuring large portholes) and impressive teak-
wood-decked bathrooms. Wind Surf was built at the same shipyard and
has the same sail-ship concept as the others, but being larger, she also
boasts a bunch of suites, more lounges and dining venues, and plenty of
excellent outside sitting and walking areas.
All cabins fleetwide have flat-screen TVs, DVD/CD players, and 
minibars. The ships offer an extensive DVD and CD collection, free 
for all passengers.

Part V
Calling All Ports:
Where to Go 
and Why

In this part . . . 
A
lot of cruise lines (and cruise passengers) behave as if
the amenities and other hoo-ha’s aboard ship are the
be-all and end-all of the cruise experience. Not so. The desti-
nations are what it’s all about. In this part, we give you a good
overview of the major (and some of the minor) ports of
embarkation and ports of call in the Caribbean, Alaska, and
the Mediterranean, and let you know what to expect on
cruises in more than a dozen other destinations, from Tahiti
to Arctic Scandinavia. We offer hints on the best shore excur-
sions you can book through the cruise lines and also tell you
what you can see on your own, whether you want to investi-
gate natural wonders and historic sites or just grab a snow
globe souvenir and hit the beach.

Chapter 14
Preparing for Ports of Call
In This Chapter
 Selecting (or rejecting) shore excursions
 Debarking, and what to bring with you
 Hopping back aboard
“G
etting there is half the fun,” as the old Cunard slogan put it, but
the other half of a cruise’s fun is being there, seeing the sights
and getting a taste of local culture at the ports of call. Aside from some
transatlantic sailings and 2-night party cruises, pretty much every cruise
includes time in port, with some itineraries more port-intensive than
others. It’s just a matter of letting the ship take you there — but when
you get there you have a few little decisions to make. This chapter walks
you through the practical ins and outs of doing just that.
Signing Up for Excursions — or Not
At almost every port of call, you have three options: join one of the
ship’s organized shore excursions, strike out on your own, or remain 
on the ship and take it easy.
Gimme the real story about excursions
Shore excursions usually mean piling into a tour bus, although at some
locations, you may take some other mode of transportation — minivan,
jet boat, kayak, horse cart, helicopter, plane, or your own two feet. The
excursion cost includes admission to any attractions visited, sometimes
a meal, dance, and/or musical performance, and (oy vey) often a stop at
a “preferred” souvenir store. A guide of varying skill and charm typically
provides running commentary that’s usually a combination of informa-
tive and corny.
For cruise passengers, most shore excursions (which we preview
throughout the chapters in this part) are all about providing conven-
ience and a sense of security. You don’t gotta do nuttin. The excursion’s
staff picks you up right at the pier, drive you to your destination, give
you a tour, and then drop you back off at the ship. Zip, boom, bang:
done. Other excursions take things a little further, providing adventure

and educational opportunities, sometimes near the port, sometimes at a
considerable distance away.
In most cases, shore excursions are run by local tour operators with
whom the cruise lines have an established business relationship. That
means more “sense of security” for you, and a cut of the profits for the
cruise lines — because remember, in almost all cases the cost of excur-
sions is not included in the upfront cruise fare.
When do shore excursions make sense?
In ports where you can best reach the sights on foot, beating your own
path is often less expensive and more exciting. However, in locales
where most attractions are far from the docks — and taxis or other local
modes of transportation are scarce, expensive, or dubious — you may
be better off going with the flow and booking an organized excursion.
Other shore excursions that are generally worth the money are sports
and adventure offerings, such as kayaking, biking, golfing, fishing, snor-
keling, scuba diving, and flightseeing tours. These expeditions take
smaller groups of passengers at a time, so you feel like part of the team
rather than part of the herd. You can book most of these activities on
your own, but by booking through the cruise line you’re trading extra
cost for lack of hassle, and assurance that the tour operator is reliable.
Are shore excursions for you?
Choosing an excursion is a matter of both personal preference and pock-
etbook concerns, and comes down to a few basic questions:
 Do you enjoy the company of a group (even on a crowded bus) and
a perky tour guide to tell you what you’re seeing, or do you prefer
exploring on your own, even if you get lost occasionally?
 Are the sights you want to see close to the docks, or some distance
away? In some ports, the most interesting sights are just a few
blocks from the dock, but if they’re far off it may cost you just as
much to go on your own. Of course, going on your own also gives
you more freedom to pursue your own interests, but you’re also
responsible for getting back to the ship on time. If an excursion’s
late in returning, the ship will wait for it. Not necessarily so if one
or two passengers haven’t returned by all-aboard time.
 How easy is it to find a cab, bus, or rental car to tour on your own,
and how reliable is that transportation?
 Does the tour include all the things you definitely want to see and
do? Some tour descriptions (especially of longer tours) read as if
you can spend hours seeing everything there is to see, but in real-
ity they move at a snail’s pace to accommodate slow-walking pas-
sengers, and take hours getting to and from the destination. If the
tour doesn’t hit everything you want to see, will you still have time
to see or do them before or after the tour?
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
272

 Does the activity you want to do require advance reservations
(such as tee times for golf)?
 How much do the attractions you want to see cost? If they’re near
the dock, it may make sense to just go on your own, rather than
pay the cruise line an extra amount to arrange tickets and a bus
transfer. However, sometimes groups get priority entry to popular
sights, such as La Sagrada Familia cathedral in Barcelona.
In the chapters that follow, we provide more detailed information on
each port, making it easier for you to answer these questions.
How much do shore excursions cost?
Costs for prearranged shore excursions vary widely: You may pay $30
for a short bus or walking tour or $400 or more for a flightseeing trip via
helicopter or plane. Prices listed in this book are adult rates; lower kids’
prices are also usually available for all tours.
Guides expect tips, although the amount is up to you. Around 5 percent
of the per-person excursion cost is about right if you enjoyed the tour.
How do you sign up?
You can book shore excursions aboard ship, or make your reservations
early, via the cruise lines’ Web sites. In most cases, excursions are listed
on the lines’ sites, along with descriptions, durations, and usually prices.
Keep in mind, if you change your mind when you get on board, you may
not be able to get a refund or make a change; definitely ask, but the
answer will depend on if the cruise line can sell your spot to someone
else and other factors.
If you wait till you get aboard to sign up, do so early, especially if you
intend to book the more specialized tours, which sometimes can only
accept a limited number of guests.
Order forms for excursions may be waiting in your cabin on arrival. If
not, you can find them at the main reception desk or shore excursions
desk, or at a shore excursions talk that many lines give on the first day
of the cruise. After you sign up, your account is charged for any cost,
and the meeting time and place for your tour is written on the tickets
delivered to your cabin before your first scheduled tour. Usually groups
meet in the ship’s theater or lounge and then debark the ship together.
Make sure that you really want to take all the tours you sign up for. The
cruise lines usually tell the local tour operators how many have signed
up so that the appropriate number of vehicles and guides can be
arranged. If you change your mind at the last minute, you’ll probably
have to pay the cost of the excursion anyway, even if you don’t go.
Chapter 14: Preparing for Ports of Call 273

Can I just sightsee on my own?
If you decide to just take in the port on your own, you can go the loose
and easy route — just wandering around and seeing what strikes you —
or you can plan your visit like Eisenhower planned D-Day. We’re big fans
of the former, though certain ports just have so many sights that a little
bit of the latter may be in order, too. Here are some tips:
 Prioritize: Create a must-see list and calculate how much time you
need to get there and how much it costs to get in when you do. You
can ask the ship’s shore excursions staff for assistance here.
 Study up on adventures: Even if you don’t want to book a shore
excursion through the cruise line, you may want to consult with the
excursion staff about what you can do on your own. But keep in
mind, unfortunately, most of the time the staff will not recommend
a specific operator due to liability reasons and to the fact that they
want you to buy their excursions, not help you buy someone else’s.
It tends to be a different story on small ships, where the staff is
often more knowledgable about solo exploring and more willing to
share what they know.
 Avoid unmarked taxis: That nice guy beckoning you over to his car
promising a cheap tour may really be a nice guy . . . or he may not.
Official, marked taxis are more likely to be legit, and often have to
abide by city- or state-mandated rates.
 Keep your cabbie: If you find a reliable cab driver that gets you
where you want to go, you may be able to have him pick you up
when it’s time to go back to the ship. This is especially important if
you head to an out-of-the-way beach area (you may not find cabs
waiting when you’re ready to go).
 Consider cost-sharing: Share the cost of a cab with a couple of
cruisemates, even if you all want to split up when you get to your
destinations. And when you negotiate the cost, make sure you and
the cab driver are talking in the same currency.
 Reserve a table: If you want to dine at a highly rated restaurant,
make a reservation before you leave home.
 Eat (and drink) smart: Keep your wits about you when snacking
ashore. What vibe do you get from that street vendor’s cart: “Looks
okay to me” or “Looks like salmonella central”? Likewise, bottled
water may be a better option than tap in some places. If you’re sus-
picious of the water quality, remember that the ice in your drink
could be dodgy, too.
 Don’t dawdle: Make sure you get back to the dock by all-aboard
time. Make a note of it, or carry your ship’s daily program with you
ashore: The time is always listed there.

Getting from Ship to Shore: 
All about Debarking
You can’t start sashaying down the gangway as soon as your ship ties 
up to the dock. Nope. You have to wait for local authorities to stamp all
kinds of paperwork first. This may be a short process or it may take up
to two hours, so relax. Have breakfast, look at the view, and study your
city guide until the captain announces the all-clear over the ship’s PA.
Docking versus anchoring
When a ship comes to port, it either docks at a pier or anchors offshore,
depending on the size of the ship (sometimes the berth isn’t deep enough
or the dock long enough to accommodate it) or the popularity of the port
that day (other ships may have gotten dibs on the docks first). Docking is
easy, at least for passengers: You just go to the gangway, swipe your
onboard ID, and you’re off. Things are a little more complicated when
you’re anchored. In these situations, passengers transit back and forth 
to shore via small boats called launches or tenders.
Tender debarkation usually works like this: When the ship first anchors
and there’s a mad rush to get off, everyone who wants to go ashore goes
to one of the public lounges and is given a number. Shore-excursion par-
ties debark first. If you’re not taking an excursion, you may get an early
tender assignment by being first in line, though you still may have to
wait a while.
When it’s time for you to go, report to the lower deck where the tenders
are loading. (Usually after the first hour or two, the number system is
ditched and you can just head directly down to the gangway whenever
Chapter 14: Preparing for Ports of Call 275
Starting your vacation before you embark
With few exceptions, a cruise’s port of embarkation is a destination of its own. Most
lines offer pre- and post-cruise packages for cruisers who want to stretch their trip by
two to four days, or more. In Alaska, the Mediterranean, Far East and some other des-
tinations, cruise lines offer escorted tours that take you away from the coastal areas,
traveling by bus, train, and sometimes boat and small plane to sights inland. These
cruisetour packages include hotel stays and transportation. If you want to make your
own hotel arrangements, we suggest properties in the main embarkation cities in the
chapters that follow.
Most ships don’t start boarding until the afternoon and don’t depart until after 4 p.m.,
so even if you arrive on departure day, you may still be able to fit in some sightseeing
at your city of embarkation. You can normally leave your luggage at the pier.

you’re ready to go ashore.) You have to descend a stairway outside the
ship to a launch platform. There, crewmembers will be ready to help you
onto the tender. Sometimes choppy waves make the boats bob like corks,
so you may need to jump a bit to get on board. If you have a disability or
just require special assistance getting in and out of the tender, alert the
crew in advance so that they can better prepare to assist you.
The ride to shore, although usually short, can sometimes be rough. If
you suffer from seasickness, try to sit near an open area and/or use a
seasickness remedy.
The tenders run all day, so you can return to the ship at any time
(including for lunch). Tenders from several anchored ships may board
from the same dock, so you have to show your ID to get aboard.
Filling your daypack
Be sure to tote the following essentials when you disembark:
 Ship boarding pass and/or shipboard identification: Without
them, you’ll have trouble getting back on board.
 Cash: Although your onboard expenses go on account, you still
need cash and maybe credit cards ashore. (Chapter 5 has the
details on getting the right currency in countries where the dollar
doesn’t fly.) Make a special note of this: After you’ve spent a few
days aboard ship in the fantasy world of your cruise, it’s easy to
forget that you need to carry cash.
 Passport or other ID: In foreign destinations, you should always
keep your passport with you. If your ship is holding onto it for
group-clearance purposes, carry a photocopy of the main page to
keep with you in port.
 Sunblock/hat: In Ibiza recently, we saw our 20,465th burnt-to-a-
crisp tourist. Don’t be number 20,466.
 Bottled water: Ships sell bottled water near the gangway, but you
can probably get it more cheaply when you get ashore.
 Beach towels: Most ships hand them out for use ashore.
Getting from Shore to Ship: 
Don’t Miss the Boat!
Cruise lines are very strict about sailing times, posting the schedules
both in the daily bulletin and at the gangway. At ports where your ship 
is tendered offshore, the final tender departure time is also listed. You
absolutely, positively need to be back at the dock at least a half-hour
before the ship’s scheduled departure — otherwise you may miss the
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
276

boat. Shore excursions provide an exception to this rule. If they run late,
the ship accepts responsibility and doesn’t generally leave without you.
If you travel on your own, however, you could get stuck.
If you do miss the boat, contact the cruise line’s port agent immediately —
they have offices near the docks, usually with a prominent sign, and their
address is sometimes listed in the ship’s daily program as well. They can
help you catch your ship at the next port of call, but you have to pay your
own way there.

Chapter 15
Landing in the Caribbean
In This Chapter
 Poking around the ports of embarkation
 Calling at the Caribbean’s ports
 Enjoying the best excursions
 Exploring private islands
W
hen most people think cruise, they think Caribbean, 
whether they mean to or not. It’s almost creepy, like they’ve been
programmed — and maybe they have. For a dog’s age, the cruise indus-
try focused laserlike on the region, and it’s still the top cruise destina-
tion, for good reason. On the practical side, the Caribbean islands (and
the Bahamas, which aren’t technically on the Caribbean Sea but might 
as well be) are pretty much in Florida’s backyard, and are so close to
one another that it makes for easy sailing. On the unpractical side are
white-sand beaches, swaying palms, clear turquoise waters, tropical fish,
lush gardens, deep rain forests, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, and even
volcanoes — plus rich Caribbean culture, spicy Caribbean food, European
colonial history, and a big dollop of laid-back island living to top it all off.
The multicultural history of the region creates a checkerboard blend, with
the architecture, language, and customs of the Spanish, French, Dutch,
Swedish, British, and Americans in their former (and current) colonies 
or possession. Pre-Columbian peoples, European explorers, pirates, and
shipwrecked sailors all contributed to the stories behind numerous ruins,
forts, churches, synagogues, historic homes, and museums.
Storming the Shore
Now granted, a lot of the islands are way touristy, but often it’s confined
to the vicinity of the docks and other resort areas. If you tire of shopping
for fine jewelry, local handicrafts, and duty-free items (or of tipping back
the beers at an island bar), you can head to more isolated and frequently
gorgeous spots along the coast or in the interior, either on your own or a
shore excursion. In this chapter we list a selection of the best excursions
offered by cruise lines in all the ports.

Major sights on many of the islands are also perfectly accessible on your
own, either on foot or with the aid of a taxi or other transportation —
going solo is a good way to avoid the throngs of other cruise passengers
(sometimes 10,000-plus on busy days in jam-packed islands like St.
Thomas and Puerto Rico). As is true everywhere, the cruise lines con-
tract with local operators to run their tours, so you may be able to get
the same trips cheaper by booking them yourself once you arrive. Of
course, you may just want the ease of having the cruise line do it for
you, figuring the extra few bucks they make off the top is worth it.
Shore excursions aren’t what they used to be either. For every bland bus
tour or mindless booze cruise, the cruise lines over the past few years
have also been programming more and more active excursions, includ-
ing rain forest hikes, mountain biking, golf, jungle canopy exploration,
scuba, sport fishing, horseback riding, and more.
The prices listed in this chapter are based on 2006 rates and may be
slightly higher in 2007.
Boarding Ship for the Caribbean
The main port cities for Caribbean cruises remain in Florida — Miami,
Fort Lauderdale, Cape Canaveral/Cocoa Beach, and Tampa — plus San
Juan (Puerto Rico). In recent years, though, cruises have been leaving
from alternative homeports such as Galveston and Houston, Texas;
Charleston, South Carolina; Norfolk, Virginia; Jacksonville, Florida; and
even as far north as Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. Beyond
Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands also serve as homeports, including
St. Thomas and Barbados.
In this chapter, we cover the most heavily trafficked ports of embarkation
for Caribbean cruises — Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Cape Canaveral/Cocoa
Beach, Tampa, and Galveston — hitting the see-and-do highlights,
whether you only have a few hours before or after your cruise or are
planning an extra couple days. (Prior to the Hurricane Katrina disaster,
New Orleans served as a popular port — and may again — but cleanup
from the devastation could take months or even years.) The cruise lines
typically offer pre- and post-cruise packages for hotels, sometimes with a
rental car, admission to local attractions, and/or organized tours.
San Juan, which is a port of embarkation and a popular port of call, is
covered in the ports of call section.
Miami
Maybe more than anyplace else in the U.S., Miami seems to embody the
cultural mash-up of fashion, celebrity, design, and wealth that is America
today. It’s the most Latin city in the country, with a stylin’ club scene
that’s utterly replaced the retirement condo lifestyle that predominated

in the 1970s. It’s like the Rat Pack era has returned, only now it’s got a
Latino accent.
Of course, all the stuff that made Miami a resort destination in the first
place is still there too: sparkling beaches, crystal clear waters, palm
fronds, and that particularly Miami style of resort hotel, jutting up right
from the beach’s edge. And it’s the undisputed cruise capital of the
world, with nearly 4 million passengers embarking here annually.
Cruising into port
Miami International Airport (% 305-876-7000; www.miami-airport.
com) is about 8 miles (or 15 minutes) west of downtown Miami and the
port. If you’ve arranged air transportation and/or transfers through the
cruise line, a cruise line rep directs you to shuttle buses that take you to
the port. Taxis are also available for a fare of about $21 (plus tip) to the
port. SuperShuttle (% 305-871-2000) charges $12 per person to the
port, with two pieces of luggage.
If you’re arriving by car from the north, take I-95 to I-395 and head east
on I-395, exiting at Biscayne Boulevard. Make a right and go south to
Port Boulevard. Make a left and go over the Port Bridge. Coming in from
the northwest, take Interstate 75 to State Road 826 (Palmetto Expwy.)
south to State Road 836 east. Exit at Biscayne Boulevard. Make a right
and go south to Port Boulevard. Make a left and go over the Port Bridge.
Parking lots at street level face the cruise terminals. Parking runs $12
per day.
A five-lane bridge from the downtown district of Miami provides access
to the number-one cruise port in the world, the Port of Miami (1015 N.
America Way; % 305-371-7678; www.miamidade.gov/portofmiami). To
accommodate the enormous amount of cruise traffic, a dozen bi-level
terminals offer easy car access (as you’re coming) and quick Customs
clearance (as you’re going).
Scoring the best excursions
Everglades Airboat Ride: The Seminole Indians called the Everglades
Pahay Okee, the “grassy water,” and on this 40-minute airboat ride you
get to see some of the area’s indigenous wildlife, including water birds
and American alligators (four hours; $45).
Exploring on your own
You probably need a taxi to hit most of the attractions in Miami.
Go to the beach! You can beachcomb along 10 miles of glorious sand and
surf between the south of Miami Beach and Haulover Beach Park at the
north end. Behind the surf, South Beach’s renowned Art Deco district
spreads out over a full square mile. All in all, it’s the largest concentration
of 1920s and 1930s resort architecture in the U.S. The district stretches
from 6th to 23rd streets, and from the Atlantic Ocean to Lennox Court.

Miami at a Glance
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 285

Ocean Drive boasts many premier Art Deco hotels, while other buildings
house chic shops, clubs, restaurants, and cafes.
Near the port, Bayside Marketplace (401 Biscayne Blvd.; % 305-577-
3344; www.baysidemarketplace.com) is a vibrant shopping and enter-
tainment complex with many bayside restaurants and cafes offering out-
door seating, plus live musicians in the evenings. Regular shuttle service
is available from the port, or you can walk over the Port Bridge.
If oil paintings turn you on more than tanning oil, the Bass Museum of
Art (2121 Park Ave.; % 305-673-7530; www.bassmuseum.org) houses 
old masters and then some. Admission is $8. Farther afield, the 70-room
Italian Renaissance-style villa now known as Vizcaya Museum & Gardens
(3251 S. Miami Ave., Coconut Grove; % 305-250-9133; www.vizcaya
museum.com) has been called “the Hearst Castle of the East.” Industrialist
James Deering employed more than a thousand artisans and laborers
from Europe and the Caribbean to build his dream house, which was
completed in 1916 but designed to look as if it had stood for centuries.
Inside, you can visit 42 rooms filled with furniture, paintings, sculpture,
tapestries, wall panels, and decorative arts brought from Europe by
Deering and his designers. Admission to the villa and gardens is $12. It’s
about a mile from downtown Miami.
Take the kids to the Miami Children’s Museum (980 MacArthur
Causeway; % 305-373-KIDS; www.miamichildrensmuseum.org), which
offers hundreds of interactive exhibits including a mini Carnival cruise
ship where kids see how a ship works, from navigating to limbo dancing.
Admission is $10; kids under 12 months free.
Across the MacArthur Causeway from the kids’ museum, 19-acre Parrot
Jungle Island (1111 Parrot Jungle Trail; % 305-2-Jungle; www.parrot
jungle.com) features an Everglades exhibit, a petting zoo, several the-
aters, jungle trails, and aviaries. Hundreds of parrots, macaws, peacocks,
cockatoos, and flamingos fly overhead, while the Serpentarium houses
the park’s reptile and amphibian collection. Continuous shows star
roller-skating cockatoos, card-playing macaws, and stunt-happy parrots.
Admission is $25 adults, $20 kids 3 to 10, free under 3.
To see sea critters in action, head to the Miami Seaquarium (4400
Rickenbacker Causeway, Key Biscayne; % 305-361-5705; www.miami
seaquarium.com), where Flipper, TV’s greatest sea mammal, performs
along with Lolita the Killer Whale. You can also see endangered mana-
tees, sea lions, tropical-theme aquariums, and a gruesome shark feeding.
Admission is $28 adults, $22 kids.
Fort Lauderdale
Fort Lauderdale’s Port Everglades is nearly as busy as the Port of
Miami, drawing more than 3.5 million cruise passengers a year. It boasts
the deepest harbor on the eastern seaboard south of Norfolk, 12 ultra-
modern cruise terminals, and easy access to the Fort Lauderdale–
Hollywood International Airport. Unlike Miami, though, Port Everglades

doesn’t offer much nearby activity — just comfortable cruise terminals
with snack bars and seating areas.
Fort Lauderdale was once infamous for the annual mayhem that
descended every spring break, but yesterday’s students have been
replaced by a far more affluent and definitely quieter yachting crowd.
Boating isn’t just a hobby here; it’s a lifestyle, with more than 300 miles 
of navigable waterways and innumerable canals criss-crossing this city.
Visitors can easily get on the water too by grabbing one of the water
taxis (% 954-467-6677; www.watertaxi.com), which sail between
Oakland Park Boulevard and Southeast 17th Street along the Intracoastal
Waterway, and west along the New River into downtown Fort Lauderdale.
All-day passes are $10.
Cruising into port
Port Everglades (% 954-523-3404) is located on State Road 84, east of U.S.
1, about a 2-mile/5-minute drive from the Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood
International Airport. It’s the easiest airport-to-cruise port trip in Florida.
If you’ve booked air or transfers through the cruise line, a representative
shows you to your shuttle after you land. If you haven’t, taking a taxi 
costs less than $10 to the port or $12 to the city. If you’re driving to Port
Everglades, you enter via Spangler Boulevard, Eisenhower Boulevard, or
Eller Drive. Parking is available in two large garages for $12 a day.
Scoring the best excursions
Everglades Airboat Ride: A longer version of this tour that we discuss
in the preceding “Miami” section also visits the Flamingo Gardens and
Wildlife Sanctuary, an old homestead that now houses a free-flight aviary
(21⁄2 hours; $39).
Exploring on your own
You need transportation (taxi or otherwise) to get around Fort
Lauderdale.
Backed by an endless row of hotels, the Fort Lauderdale Beach is
located along Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard between SE 17th Street
and Sunrise Boulevard. The Fort Lauderdale Beach Promenade is ideal
for rollerblading, biking, or just strolling.
In the walk-through, screened-in aviary at Butterfly World (Tradewinds
Park South, 3600 W. Sample Rd., Coconut Creek, west of the Florida
Turnpike; % 954-977-4400; www.butterflyworld.com), visitors can see
150 different varieties of the colorful insects performing butterfly ballet
all summer long. Admission is $19 adults, $14 kids 4 to 12, free for kids 3
and under. In downtown Fort Lauderdale, the Museum of Discovery &
Science (401 SW Second St.; % 954-467-6637; www.mods.org) is an
excellent interactive science museum with an IMAX theater and more
than a dozen themed, hands-on exhibitions. Admission for both IMAX
and exhibits is $14 adults, $12 kids 3 to 12, free for 2 and under.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
288

The Museum of Art (downtown at 1 E. Las Olas Blvd.; % 954-763-6464;
www.moafl.org) is a terrific small museum with a permanent collection
of 20th-century European and American art that includes works by
Picasso, Calder, Warhol, Mapplethorpe, and Dalí. Admission is $6 adults,
$3 kids 12 to 17, free for kids 11 and under; closed Tuesdays.
Cape Canaveral/Cocoa Beach
Known as the “Space Coast” because of nearby Kennedy Space Center,
the Cape Canaveral/Cocoa Beach/Melbourne area is really anything but
space-age looking. Stretched out along 72 miles of beachfront, it’s prima-
rily a string of hotels, malls, and suburban homes on little side streets.
Because the area is only about an hour west of Orlando’s theme parks,
it’s become a major port of embarkation for cruise ships, especially ones
offering 3- and 4-night cruises that can be paired with 4- and 3-night stays
at the Orlando resorts, to make a full week’s vacation.
Once fairly quiet, the port got a big boost when Disney Cruise Line
started up, building a gorgeous new port facility in 1998. Recently, the
area has also begun to benefit from the industry trend of homeporting
cruise ships in northerly cities and running them down the coast to the
Bahamas. NCL’s Norwegian Dawn, for example, includes Port Canaveral
as a stop on her weekly round-trip Florida/Bahamas cruises from New
York, giving passengers access to Orlando and to the Space Center
Visitors Complex.
Cruising into port
Port Canaveral is located at the eastern end of the Bennett Causeway,
just off State Road 528 (the Bee Line Expwy.), the direct route from
Orlando International, the nearest airport, about 45 minutes away.
Cruise line representatives meet you if you’ve booked air and/or trans-
fers through the line. If not, the Cocoa Beach Shuttle (% 800-633-0427
or 321-784-3831) offers shuttle service for $30 per person each way. By
car, the area is accessible from virtually every interstate highway along
the East Coast. Most visitors arrive via Route 1, Interstate 95, or S.R. 528.
Parking at the port costs $10 a day.
Scoring the best excursions
Disney World: Trip includes transportation to the park and an access
pass (eight hours; $145).
Universal Studios: Trip includes transportation to and from the park
and a standard-access pass (eight hours; $105).
Kennedy Space Center: Essentially the same experience you get going
on your own, plus transportation (five to seven hours; $69–$84).
Exploring on your own
You need a car or taxis to explore the area, which is very spread out.

Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
290
Although some folks prefer to dash over to Disney World or Universal
Studios, we’re bigger fans of the John F. Kennedy Space Center Visitor
Complex (State Road 405 E., Titusville; % 321-449-4444; www.kennedy
spacecenter.com), home to American space flight since the unmanned
Bumper 8 research rocket launch in 1950. The complex has real NASA
rockets, the actual Mercury Mission Control Room from the 1960s, and
exhibits and films (including IMAX) that look at space exploration from
the 1950s to today. Tours explore various parts of the huge space center
complex, with the complimentary hop-on/hop-off bus tour taking in the
LC-39 Observation Gantry (with a view of where the space shuttles lift
off) and the impressive Apollo/Saturn V Center, which includes arti-
facts, photos, interactive exhibits, and an actual 363-foot Saturn V
rocket. Buses for this tour operate continuously, leaving every 15 min-
utes from the visitor center. Extra-cost tours allow you to visit parts of
the space center where rockets and shuttles are prepared and launched.
Down the road from the visitor complex, near the intersection of Routes
1 and 405, the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame has an extraordinary

museum of space history, and several simulator rides that let you expe-
rience high G-forces, weightlessness, and the ups and downs of space
flight. Admission (including all exhibits, Astronaut Encounter, IMAX
space films, the KSC tour, and the Astronaut Hall of Fame) is $38 adults,
$28 kids 3 to 11, free for kids under 3. Note that the last tour departs at
2:15 p.m. from the Visitors Complex, so get there early and spend the
day — it will take that long to see everything.
If you prefer hanging out at the beach, you have a lot to choose from.
Right near the port, Jetty Park (400 E. Jetty Rd; % 321-783-7111) is the
most elaborate and best-landscaped of the local beaches, with picnic
areas, a snack bar, bathrooms, showers, a children’s playground, and
fishing available. Farther along the A1A, at Meade Avenue, the Cocoa
Beach Pier is more of a partying spot, with volleyball, surfing, and an
open-air bar. Lori Wilson Park, farther south at 1500 N. Atlantic Ave., is
another nicely landscaped area with bathrooms and showers, and a
rustic boardwalk with shaded picnic areas and benches.
Tampa
On the other side of Florida from the rest of the cruise ports, Tampa was
a sleepy little town until Cuban immigrants began arriving in the 1880s
and founded the local cigar industry. A few years later, magnate Henry B.
Plant put Tampa on the tourist map by building a railroad into town.
Teddy Roosevelt trained his Rough Riders here during the Spanish-
American War, and various economic booms gave the city both its
charming, Victorian-style Hyde Park suburb and its towering downtown
skyline. The seaport area is under redevelopment, with the Florida
Aquarium and the Garrison Seaport Center (a 30-acre complex of
shops, restaurants, and entertainment, including an IMAX theater) being
joined by office buildings, apartment complexes, and another major
shopping/dining/entertainment center called Channelside.
On the western shore of Tampa Bay, St. Petersburg is the picturesque
and pleasant flip side of Tampa’s busy busy-ness. Originally conceived
and built primarily for tourists and wintering snowbirds, it’s got a nice
downtown area, some quality museums, and a few good restaurants.
Ships sailing from here head primarily to the western Caribbean,
Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, and Central America.
Cruising into port
The Port of Tampa is set amid a complicated network of channels and
harbors near the historic Cuban enclave of Ybor City and its deep-water
Ybor Channel. The cruise terminals are all located along Channelside
Drive, close to the heart of things. If you’re flying, you’ll probably arrive
at Tampa International Airport, approximately 5 miles from downtown
near the junction of Florida 60 and Memorial Highway. If you haven’t
arranged transfers with the cruise line, the port is an easy 30-minute taxi
ride away, with a set fare of $20 per car for up to four people. By car, all

roads — or at least I-275, I-75, I-4, U.S. 41, U.S. 92, and U.S. 301 — lead to
Tampa. Parking at the port is $12 per day.
Scoring the best excursions
Tampa City Tour: A bus-tour overview of Tampa, with 90 minutes in Ybor
City (including the Ybor State Museum), and visits to the University of
Tampa, opulent Bayshore Drive, and Hyde Park (four hours; $36).
Exploring on your own
Tampa is best explored by car, as only the commercial district can be
covered on foot. Most interesting, culturally, is the old Latin enclave of
Ybor City, located about a mile from the docks. Once known as the cigar
capital of the world and now one of three national historic districts in
Florida, it offers Spanish architecture, antique street lamps, cigar shops,
boutiques, nightclubs, and great Cuban food. Most restaurants are
spread out along 7th Avenue, the main artery, which is closed to traffic
at night. The Ybor City Museum State Park (1818 9th Ave., between 18th
and 19th streets; % 813-247-6323; www.ybormuseum.org) has displays
on the area’s cigar history. Admission is $3; free for kids under 6.
You can get a glimpse of another culture — the Gilded Age tourist kind —
at the Henry B. Plant Museum (401 W. Kennedy Blvd.; % 813-254-1891;
www.plantmuseum.com), easily identified on the Tampa skyline by its 13
silver minarets and distinctive Moorish architecture. It opened in 1891 as
the Tampa Bay Hotel, a magnet for wintering society types; it’s now filled
with European and Oriental furnishings and decorative arts from the orig-
inal hotel collection. Admission is $5 adults, $2 for kids under 12; closed
Mondays. The permanent collection of the Tampa Museum of Art (600 N.
Ashley Dr.; % 813-274-8732; www.tampamuseum.com) is especially strong
in ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman artifacts, as well as 20th-century
art. Admission is $8 adults, $3 students with ID, and free for kids under 6;
closed Mondays.
Kid-friendly but not wallet-friendly, Busch Gardens (3605 E. Bougainvilla
Ave., north of downtown; % 888-800-5447; www.buschgardens.com) is
still Tampa Bay’s most popular attraction, offering thrill rides, themed
“lands” (including Egypt, Timbuktu, Morocco, and the Congo), live enter-
tainment, shops, restaurants, games, and a zoo with nearly 3,400 ani-
mals. Admission is reeeeeaaaaaalllly high: $58 for adults, $48 for kids 3
to 9, free for kids 2 and under. Oh, and there’s a 7 percent tax on top of
that, and parking costs $9.
Near the docks, the Florida Aquarium (701 Channelside Dr.; % 813-273-
4000; www.flaquarium.org) displays more than 10,000 aquatic plants
and animals in a state-of-the-art setting. Admission: $18 for adults; $13
for kids.
If you want to go to the beach, you have to head to neighboring St.
Petersburg, which has a north-to-south string of interconnected white
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 293

sandy shores. While you’re there, grab a skein of surrealism at the
Salvador Dalí Museum (1000 Third St. S., St. Petersburg; % 727-823-
3767; www.salvadordalimuseum.org), which contains the world’s
largest collection of Dalí’s work, including 95 oil paintings; more than 100
watercolors and drawings; and 1,300 sketches, sculptures, photographs,
and objects d’art. Admission: $14 for adults.
Galveston
Galveston was one of the first ports to which the cruise industry spread
when it decided Florida just wasn’t enough anymore. Located on a 30-by-
2-mile barrier island off the Texas mainland, it’s an ideal port from which
to sail for the western Caribbean, letting ships reach open sea quickly
and be on their way.
The port city’s main attractions are its historic districts, full of Victorian
architecture, and its beaches, which draw crowds of Houstonians and
other Texans during the summer.
Cruising into port
The Texas Cruise Ship Terminal at the Port of Galveston (% 409-766-
6113; www.portofgalveston.com) is at Harborside Drive and 25th
Street, on Galveston Island. It’s reached via I-45 south from Houston. If
you’re flying in, you’ll land at one of two Houston airports: William P.
Hobby Airport (south of downtown Houston, and about 31 miles, or a
45-minute drive, from the terminal) or George Bush Intercontinental
Airport (just north of downtown Houston, and about 54 miles, or an 80-
min. drive, from the terminal). Information on both is available at the
Houston Airport System Web site, www.fly2houston.com.
If you’ve arranged air transportation and/or transfers through the cruise
line, a representative directs you to shuttle buses that take you to the
port. Taxis are also available, but the price is steep: about $85 per car-
load from Hobby or $145 from Bush. If you’re driving to the port, I-45 is
the main artery for those arriving from the north. To get to the terminal,
follow I-45 South to Exit 1C (at Harborside Dr./Hwy. 275); it’s the first exit
after the causeway. Turn left (east) onto Harborside Drive and continue
for about 5 miles to the cruise terminal. Parking rates are based on
length of cruise, with 4-day prices starting at $52.
Scoring the best excursions
City Tour: This basic bus tour visits the historic Strand District before
heading on to Houston’s downtown theater and museum districts,
Hermann Park (home to the Houston Zoo), and River Oaks, Houston’s
most prestigious residential neighborhood. The tour ends at the airport,
making it easy for departing passengers (31⁄2 hours; $47).
Exploring on your own
If you’ve only got a few hours before you have to board your cruise,
focus on the Strand National Historic Landmark District, the heart of

commercial Galveston in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and just steps
from the cruise terminals, running from 19th to 25th streets between
Church Street and the piers. Galveston was a booming commercial port
back when cotton was king, and the Strand was its Wall Street. Today, its
restored three- and four-story buildings, many with decorative ironwork
facades, house shopping and dining.
The East End Historic District is Galveston’s old silk-stocking neighbor-
hood, running from 9th to 19th streets between Broadway and Church
Street. It has many lovely houses that have been completely restored.
Three large mansions-turned-museums have regular tours: Ashton Villa
(2328 Broadway; % 409-762-3933; www.galvestonhistory.com); the
Moody Mansion (2618 Broadway; % 409-762-7668); and the Bishop’s
Palace (1402 Broadway; % 409-762-2475), the most interesting of the
bunch. Admission to each is $6.

For a different take on cruising before you head out on your megaship,
visit the Elissa, a three-masted, iron-hulled sailing ship built in 1877 and
now the main attraction at the Texas Seaport Museum (Pier 21, % 409-
763-1877; www.tsm-elissa.org). Admission is $6 adults, $4 kids 7 to
18, free ages 6 and under.
While Galveston’s beaches may not be as great as, say, Miami’s, a good
beach is better than no beach at all. East Beach and Stewart Beach both
have pavilions with dressing rooms, showers, and restrooms, and are
good for day-trippers. Stewart Beach is located at the end of Broadway,
and East Beach is about a mile east of Stewart Beach. Locals and visitors
alike also enjoy walking, skating, or biking along Seawall Boulevard,
built after the giant September 1900 storm that killed 6,000 of the
island’s residents — one out of every six. The Seawall stretches for 10
miles along Galveston’s shoreline from its eastern edge, providing a kind
of low-key boardwalk atmosphere.
New Orleans
New Orleans was brought to its knees by Hurricane Katrina in the last
days of August 2005, with floodwaters inundating whole neighborhoods,
causing massive destruction and loss of life, and forcing tens of thou-
sands from their homes. It was the largest natural disaster to ever strike
a major American city, and its effects will be felt for years to come.
Nevertheless, New Orleans has a soul that can’t wither and a backbone
that won’t quit. Within weeks of the storm, New Orleans’ businesses
were reopening their doors, working back toward normalcy one step at a
time. In late February of this year (2006) they held Mardi Gras, right on
time, and if it wasn’t the grandest ever, it sure wasn’t half bad either.
To the visitor — and yes, there are visitors — the central parts of town,
the most frequently touristed parts, look relatively normal. The French
Quarter, the oldest and most historic part of the city, survived almost
completely intact, minus a few details. Ditto for the Garden District, that
area to the south full of beautiful ornate homes. But, almost everywhere
you look there are signs that things aren’t right. At press time in spring
of 2006, postal delivery was still not operating normally and neither
were quintessentially New Orleans delights like the St. Charles street-
cars, out of commission and short on cash for repairs. Things get worse
out beyond the tourist areas. The hard-hit Lower Ninth Ward, for instance,
looked like Hiroshima after the bomb, with block after block of unlivable
ruins that were once peoples’ homes.
As New Orleans was very much a work in progress as this book was being
prepared, consider the following to be an outline of what will likely greet
cruise passengers when cruise ships return to the port in October 2006.
For additional information, check the Post-Katrina Resource Guide
at the New Orleans Convention & Visitors Bureau website (www.new
orleanscvb.com), which lists the open/closed status of many of the
city’s tourist-oriented businesses and attractions.

The French Quarter at a Glance
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 297
Cruising into port
At press time, the Erato Street Cruise Terminal complex and parking
garage were scheduled for completion in September 2006. There are also
plans to construct a terminal at Poland Avenue, scheduled for comple-
tion sometime in 2007. For more information, contact the Port of New
Orleans at % 504-522-2551; www.portno.com.
Though the French Quarter can be done on foot, if you need wheels,
taxis are typically plentiful. If necessary, call United Cabs (% 504-522-
9771) and a car will come in 10 minutes. The meter begins at $2.50 plus
$1 for each additional person, and goes to $1.30 per mile thereafter. At
press time, the St. Charles Streetcar was still not in service, though it’s

expected to be up and running again in November 2006. Other streetcar
lines were running on a limited schedule. You can board the streetcar at
the French Market Riverfront stop (where Esplanade Avenue meets the
River, at the entrance of the French Market). The Riverfront line runs
from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day. A Canal Street route also runs from the
Esplanade to the historic former Krauss Building (near Basin Street)
from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day. Check the New Orleans Regional
Transit Authority website (www.norta.com) for updated information.
From Jackson Square (at Decatur Street), you can take a 21⁄4-mile, 30-
minute horse-drawn carriage ride through the French Quarter. Royal
Carriage Tour Co. (% 504-943-8820) offers private rides for up to four
passengers in a Cinderella carriage for $60 a pop, daily from 9 a.m. to
midnight.
Scoring the best shore excursions
At press time, no information was available regarding excursions in and
around the city.
Exploring on your own
Made up of about 90 square blocks, the French Quarter (also known as
the Vieux Carré, or “Old Square”) was laid out by the French engineer
Adrien de Pauger in 1718, and a strict preservation policy pre-Katrina
(and high ground and good luck during and after) has kept it looking
much the way it always has. Its major public area is Jackson Square
(bounded by Chartres, Decatur, St. Peter, and St. Ann sts.), where musi-
cians, artists, fortunetellers, jugglers, and those peculiar “living statue”
guys gather to sell their wares or entertain for change. The main drag,
however, is Bourbon Street, which is basically Sodom and Gomorrah,
though in a good way.
Incorporating seven historic buildings connected by a brick courtyard,
the Historic New Orleans Collection, 533 Royal St., between St. Louis
and Toulouse streets (% 504-523-4662; www.hnoc.org), evokes the New
Orleans of 200 years ago. Admission is free; closed Mondays.
Constructed from 1795 through 1799 as the Spanish government seat in
New Orleans, The Cabildo, 701 Chartres St., at Jackson Square (% 800-
568-6968 or 504-568-6968), was the site of the signing of the Louisiana
Purchase transfer and today offers an exhibition that traces the history
of Louisiana from exploration through Reconstruction. Admission $6
adults, $5 for students and seniors, free for children under 12; closed
Mondays.
Also on Jackson Square, The Presbytère, 751 Chartres St. (% 800-568-
6968 or 504-568-6968), was planned as housing for clergy but is now 
a Mardi Gras museum that traces the history of the annual event.
Admission $6 adults, $5 seniors and students, free for children under 12;
closed Mondays. At press time, The Presbytère hasn’t yet reopened but
it is expected to by mid 2006. Call ahead before visiting.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
298

Aside from the Quarter, the one other neighborhood that absolutely
deserves your attention is the Garden District, one of the most pictur-
esque areas of the city. It’s mostly residential, but what residences.
Throughout the middle of the 19th century, developers built the
Victorian, Italianate, and Greek Revival homes that still line the streets. If
it’s back up and running when you arrive, take the St. Charles streetcar
from the French Quarter (see the preceding section “Getting Around”)
for the full effect.
And then, of course, there are the dead: Because New Orleans is prone
to flooding, bodies have been interred aboveground since its earliest
days, in sometimes very elaborate tombs that are definitely worth a
visit. St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, Basin Street between Conti and St. Louis
streets, at the top of the French Quarter, is the oldest extant cemetery
(1789). In the Garden District, Lafayette Cemetery No. 1, 1427 Sixth St.,
right across the street from Commander’s Palace Restaurant, is another
old cemetery that’s been beautifully restored. Though both of these
cemeteries are usually full of visitors during the day, you should exercise
caution when touring, as they’ve seen some crime over the years.
The Ports of Call
This section details most of the Caribbean islands visited by cruise
ships, as well as some popular ports in the Florida Keys, the Bahamas,
and Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula.
Antigua
Antigua (an-tee-gah) is the largest of the British Leeward Islands, once
the home to Britain’s most important Caribbean naval base (Nelson’s
Dockyard) and now mostly the home of warm tradewinds, powder-white
sand beaches, scuba-friendly coral reefs, and about 68,000 Antiguans. St.
John’s, the island’s capital and main town, is a quiet place full of cobble-
stone sidewalks and weather-beaten wooden houses. Close to port, you
can shop in restored warehouses. Away from town, the rolling, rustic
island boasts important historic sites and a laid-back vibe.
The language here is English. The Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$2.70 =
US$1; EC$1 = US37¢) is Antigua’s official currency, but the U.S. dollar is
accepted everywhere.
Cruising into port
Most cruise ships dock at the Nevis Street Pier or Heritage Quay (pro-
nounced “key”), both located in St. John’s, the island’s only town of any
size. From there, you can either walk or take a short taxi ride into town.
A handful of smaller vessels drop anchor at English Harbour, near
Nelson’s Dockyard on the south coast.

Scoring the best excursions
Nelson’s Dockyard National Park Tour: After heading across the island,
you can visit the site of the planet’s last surviving, working Georgian
dockyard, with original colonial structures including forts, residences,
and barracks (three hours; $49).
Helicopter to Montserrat Volcano: In December 1997, the Soufriere Hills
Volcano on the nearby island of Montserrat erupted, burying much of
the island in lava. This trip takes you over both the volcano and the
lunar highlights of Montserrat’s exclusion zone, the area declared off-
limits to ground transportation (two hours; $248).
Off Road 4×4 Jeep Safari Adventure: Tour the island’s only remaining
rain forest via a four-wheel-drive vehicle, and stop at the ruins of forts,
sugar mills, and plantation houses. The excursion includes beach time
(three hours; $66).

Hiking Safari Adventure: This 4-mile uphill/downhill hike takes you
through Antigua’s rain forest and up to a 1,200-foot lookout for panoramic
views (three hours; $49).
Exploring on your own
Most of the major attractions here are beyond walking distance. Taxis
meet every cruise ship, and taxi drivers are qualified tour guides, charg-
ing fixed fares of around $20 per hour for sightseeing trips (for up to four
people, with a two-hour minimum). For a scenic 20-mile circular route
across Antigua’s main mountain range, ask your driver to take you along
the steep and sometimes bumpy Fig Tree Drive for fantastic views of
tropical forests and fishing villages. In the local lingo, fig tree actually
means banana tree.
You can find the Antigua and Barbuda Department of Tourism at Nevis
Street and Friendly Alley in St. John’s.
Within walking distance: Apart from duty-free shopping close to the
docks at Heritage Quay and Redcliffe Quay, St. John’s itself is a little
rusty, attractions-wise. Near the main docks, at the intersection of
Market and Long streets, the old 1750s Court House building now con-
tains the Museum of Antigua and Barbuda (% 268-462-1469; www.
antiguamuseums.org), which traces the nation’s history from its geo-
logical birth to the present day. Admission is free, but a donation of $2 
is requested. Closed Sundays. While you’re there, pick up one of the 
two brochures that detail a self-guided walking tour past the historic
buildings along Redcliffe Quay, one of the oldest parts of town, with
restored, Pez-colored Georgian buildings. Once a trade center for slaves,
rum, sugar, and coffee, it now has a yacht marina, cafes, and boutiques.
Top off the tour with a rum punch at Redcliffe Tavern. A couple of
blocks uphill from the museum, St. John’s Anglican Cathedral (between
Long and Newgate streets at Church Street) dominates St. John’s skyline
with its twin spires. The current cathedral was built in 1847, replacing an
earlier structure lost to an earthquake.
If your ship is in town on a Friday or Saturday morning, the market at the
lower end of Market Street gives a little taste of the local lifestyle, with
residents bartering goods and gossip.
Beyond walking distance: From St. John’s, take an excursion or taxi 
11 miles to Nelson’s Dockyard National Park (% 268-481-5021; www.
antiguamuseums.org/nelsonsdockyard.htm), once headquarters to
British Admiral Horatio Nelson (1784–87) and now one of the most his-
toric sites in the eastern Caribbean. At the heart of this landmark is the
Dockyard Museum, where you discover the facility’s links to the era of
privateers, pirates, and great sea battles. A number of other historic
structures are dotted around the park, as well as numerous artifacts
related to 17th- and 18th-century maritime life, and even some sailors’
graffiti dating back to the 1740s. The park grounds are well worth explor-
ing, full of sandy beaches, tropical vegetation, and a number of nature
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 301

trails, which can take anywhere from 30 minutes to five hours to explore.
Admission to the whole park is $5. Free guided tours last 15 to 20 minutes.
Uphill and east of the Dockyard, the Dows Hill Interpretation Center
(% 268-481-5045) is part of the Shirley Heights military complex, which
dates to the mid-18th century. It features a multimedia review of Antigua’s
history, from the British military occupation to the island’s role in the
slave trade. Continue up the hill to see a number of other military struc-
tures and the Shirley Heights Lookout, once the main signal station used
to warn of approaching bad guys, now just a great view of the harbor
below and the French island of Guadeloupe in the distance.
You can reach the best beaches by taxi, but remember to arrange for
your driver to pick you up later so that you don’t get stranded. Fort
James Beach is the closest to St. John’s, about 5 minutes ($7 by taxi)
from the cruise dock. It’s popular with both locals and tourists, and
often has games of volleyball and cricket going on, plus umbrellas and
beach chairs for rent. Just a little farther north (a $10 cab ride away),
Runaway Bay and Dickenson Bay are the island’s busiest beaches, with
numerous resort hotels, restaurants, and watersports vendors. The
water is calm, and chairs and umbrellas are available for rent. If you
crave complete peace and quiet, head to Half Moon Bay, which is as far
as you can get from St. John’s and still be in Antigua.
Aruba
Way down in the southernmost southern Caribbean, Aruba is one of 
the so-called ABC islands — Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao — that lie just
20 miles or so off the South American coast. Blessed with perpetually
sunny skies (annual rainfall is only 17 inches), warm temperatures, 
and cool breezes, the island also has some of the best beaches in the
Caribbean, plus great snorkeling, scuba diving, windsurfing, and pretty
much anything else you can do on the water. Inland, all that dryness
means a stark landscape full of cacti and iguanas.
The island is legally part of the Netherlands, so expect a vaguely Dutch
feel. Oranjestad, the island’s capital and the location of the cruise docks,
has Dutch- and Spanish-influenced architecture (the latter owing to the
proximity of Venezuela), great shopping, casinos, restaurants, bars, and
yachting marinas, many right along Lloyd G. Smith Boulevard, the main
drag, which runs along the waterfront.
The official language is Dutch, but nearly everybody speaks English. You
also hear Spanish and Papiamento, a regional dialect that combines
Dutch, Spanish, and English with Amerindian and African words. The
Aruba florin (AFl) is the official currency (1.77 AFl = US$1; 1 AFl =
US56¢), but U.S. dollars are as widely accepted.

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 303
Cruising into port
Cruise ships arrive at the Aruba Port Authority, a modern terminal on
the island’s southern coast, in the capital city of Oranjestad. From the
pier, it’s a five-minute walk to the downtown shopping districts.
Scoring the best excursions
In addition to the tours described here, cruise lines typically offer about
a dozen snorkeling, diving, sailing, and other water-oriented tours.

Off-Road Jeep Adventure: If you like the idea of exploring the island by
four-wheel-drive but don’t want to go it alone, this tour puts you in a
convoy of other like-minded souls. A guide stays in touch by radio, and
schedules a stop for lunch and swimming (41⁄2 hours; $94).
Mountain Biking on the North Coast: Bike along 10 miles of Aruba’s wild
north coast, visiting a gold mine, a natural bridge cut by the sea and wind,
the little Alto Vista Chapel (dating to 1750), and the California Lighthouse
at the island’s northwesternmost point (31⁄2 hours; $59).
Atlantis Submarine Adventure: Cruise 150 feet below the ocean in a
submarine to see coral reefs, shipwrecks, and hundreds of curious tropi-
cal fish (11⁄2 hours; $94).
Exploring on your own
Shopping, a couple casinos, and a few museums are within walking dis-
tance of the port. To get to anything else you need wheels. Taxis line up
at the dock and operate on a fixed-fare basis, with every driver carrying
a copy of the official rate schedule (to the beach resorts, it’s generally
$8–$10). Another option is riding the bus, which stops across the street
from the cruise terminal (on L. G. Smith Boulevard) and takes you to 
the casinos, hotel resorts, and beaches of Aruba’s west coast. Fares are
inexpensive — about $2 round-trip.
Excellent roads connect major tourist attractions, so many people rent
mopeds (for about $30–$40 a day). You can get further information on
rentals at the cruise terminal or at the many bike shops on Lloyd G.
Smith Boulevard. You can also rent a car or four-wheel-drive vehicle
from Hertz, Budget, Avis, or one of the other rental-car companies, all of
which have offices here.
The roads get very slippery when even slightly wet or when sand blows
across them. Drive on the right.
Within walking distance: One of your first welcoming sights is the row
of colorful boats docked at Schooner Harbor, where locals set up open
stalls to display their goods. Up the beach, you can buy fresh seafood
right off the boat. Wilhelmina Park, with a statue honoring Queen
Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, shows the island’s Dutch influences and
includes a tropical garden.
From the port facility, walk about five minutes up Lloyd G. Smith
Boulevard, the main road that runs from Queen Beatrix Airport along the
waterfront up to Palm Beach. This is where your shopping spree starts,
should you have that kind of thing in mind. For quality items such as
French perfume, Swiss watches, German and Japanese cameras, English
bone china, and other quality goods, cross the street to Caya GF Betico
Croes, the city’s main shopping drag. Delft blue pottery and Edam and
Gouda cheeses from Holland are especially good buys.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
304

Two casinos are located just steps from the dock: the elegant, 24-hour
Crystal Casino (at the Aruba Renaissance Beach Resort, L. G. Smith Blvd.
82; % 297-58-36000), and the less assuming Seaport Casino (L. G. Smith
Blvd. 9; % 297-58-36000). Both get crowded when ships are in port.
Beyond walking distance: If you’re renting wheels or taking a taxi tour,
you can scope the whole range of Aruba’s desert island landscape in a
day. You can reach two of the best beaches on the island, Palm Beach
and Eagle Beach (both along the Turquoise Coast, west of Oranjestad)
via taxi from the cruise terminal for about $9. All of Aruba’s beaches are
public, but chairs and shade huts are hotel property. If you use them,
expect to be charged.
The Alhambra Casino (J. E. Irausquin Blvd. 47; % 297-58-35000) is the
island’s busiest casino, with a Moorish theme. The 8,000-square-foot
place is located at the Manchebo Beach Resort, west of Oranjestad.
About 15 miles southeast of Oranjestad, in the center of the island, the
541-foot Hooiberg hill (also known as The Haystack) offers views of
Venezuela if the visibility is good. And you only have to climb 600 steps
to reach the top. Beyond, further into the island’s interior, the building-
size Ayo and Casibari rock formations served Aruba’s early inhabitants
as dwellings or religious sites — nobody’s sure which, though the red-
dish-brown petroglyphs on the boulders suggest mystical significance.
Keep going to the northern (Caribbean side) coast to see what’s left of
the once much-photographed Natural Bridge. The limestone arch above
the sea collapsed in 2005. You can still see the Baby Natural Bridge,
though, in the same area, its span carved out by centuries of pounding
surf. A little to the west, the hulking ruins of the Bushiribana Gold
Smelter offer another photo-op for folks interested in industrial design.
Its multitiered interior offers great sea views.
Head east on the northern coast to see Arikok National Park, which
covers a full 20 percent of the island. Its most popular attraction is a
series of caves, foremost of which is Fontein Cave, with its brownish-red
drawings left by Amerindians and graffiti etched by early European set-
tlers. Nearby Quadirikiri Cave has two large chambers with roof open-
ings that allow sunlight in, making flashlights unnecessary. Hundreds of
small bats use the 100-foot tunnel to reach their nests deeper in the
cave. Another area cave, 300-foot Baranca Sunu, is more commonly
known as the Tunnel of Love because of its heart-shaped entrance. You
need a flashlight (for rent for $6) to explore.
You can see caves decorated with Arawak artwork — the oldest traces
of human existence on the island — in Savaneta, on the south side of the
island about 25 minutes east of Oranjestad by taxi. The area was also a
19th-century industrial center for phosphate mining. Until 1985, an
Exxon oil subsidiary refinery operated here. To the east, San Nicolas is
home to Charlie’s Bar and Restaurant (Main Street; % 297-8-45086),
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 305

which has served two-fisted drinks and decent food since 1941 in a nos-
talgic setting crammed with pennants, banners, trophies, and other
memorabilia.
The Bahamas
Exotic they’re not. Nassau and Freeport are some of the busiest cruise
ports on the Caribbean circuit, even though technically the Bahamas
aren’t in the Caribbean at all — they’re in the Atlantic, north of the
Caribbean and fewer than 100 miles from Miami. Though holdovers from
Great Britain’s long colonial occupation linger in some architecture and
culture, the vibe here isn’t all that much different from parts of Florida,
and the ports are totally tourist-oriented, with more shopping than at the
Mall of America, all surrounded by beaches, casinos, and golf courses.
English is the official language of the Bahamas. Its legal tender is the
Bahamian dollar (B$1), whose value is always the same as that of the
U.S. dollar. Both currencies are accepted everywhere on the islands.
Cruising into port
In Freeport, ships dock at a dreary port in the middle of nowhere, a $16
taxi ride from Freeport and the International Bazaar, center of most of
the action.
In Nassau, the cruise ship docks are at Prince George Wharf in the center
of town at Rawson Square, in the middle of Nassau’s shopping frenzy.
Scoring the best excursions
In addition to the following excursions, cruise lines typically offer a vari-
ety of snorkeling, diving, and boat tours.
Dolphin Encounter: Pat a dolphin on the nose! On this excursion from
Freeport, you can watch, touch, and photograph Flipper, or at least one
of his relatives. Organized by Unexso Dolphin Encounter (at Sanctuary
Bay) (31⁄4 hours; $80–$89).
Kayak Nature Tour: Visit a protected island creek, kayak through a man-
grove forest, explore the island’s caves, and take a guided nature walk
into Lucayan National Park. This Freeport excursion includes lunch and
beach time (six hours; $70–$75).
Harbor Cruise and Atlantis Resort: A tour boat with a local guide
shows you the sights (such as they are) from the water, then drops you
at the fanciful Atlantis Resort in Nassau for a brief tour that includes a
visit to Predator Lagoon, home to sharks, barracuda, and other toothy
fish (21⁄2 hours; $42).
Thriller Powerboat Tour: A thrill-seeker’s excursion, with high-speed
boats roaring around the waters off Nassau, scaring the hell out of the
fish. Not our personal favorite way to see . . . well, anything, but it sure is
fast (one hour; $50).
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
306

Exploring on your own in Freeport/Lucaya
Freeport/Lucaya on Grand Bahama Island is visited by far fewer ships
than Nassau. Originally intended as two separate developments, Freeport
(the landlocked section of town) and Lucaya (which hugs the waterfront)
have grown together over the years, offering a mix of sun, surf, golf,
tennis, and watersports.
When you get to Freeport by taxi, you can explore the center of town 
on foot. Taxis can also take you to farther-flung attractions. The govern-
ment sets taxi rates, which start at $3 and increase 40¢ for each addi-
tional 1⁄4-mile (plus $3 extra per passenger).
Within walking distance: Nothing of note is within walking distance of
the port. You must take a cab for all attractions.
Beyond walking distance: A couple of miles east of downtown Freeport
on East Settlers Way, the 100-acre Rand Nature Centre (% 242-352-5438)
serves as the regional headquarters of the Bahamas National Trust.
Pineland nature trails meander past native flora and wild birds, including
the Bahama parrot. Admission is $5. Closed weekends.
If you’d like a taste of the Bahamas the way they used to be, head for the
Star Club on the island’s west end (Bayshore Road; % 242-346-6207).
Built in the 1940s, the Star was Grand Bahama’s first hotel, and over the
years it’s hosted many famous guests. Come for the good times and to
mix with the locals, not for the food. Lunch costs $8. Next door, Austin’s
Calypso Bar is a colorful old dive if ever there was one.
Your best bet at this port is to head for the beach. Xanadu, immediately
east of Freeport at the Xanadu Beach Resort, is the premier stretch in
the Lucaya area, offering most watersports equipment. It can get
crowded at times. Taíno Beach, Churchill Beach, and Fortune Beach
are all conveniently located on the Lucaya oceanfront. A 20-minute ride
east of Lucaya, Gold Rock Beach may be the island’s best. Secluded in
Lucayan National Park, it has barbecue pits, picnic tables, and a spectac-
ular low tide. Barbary Beach, slightly closer to Lucaya, is great for
seashell hunters, and in May and June white spider lilies in the area
bloom spectacularly.
Then again, maybe shopping is the top draw (just shows you how blah
this island is). The International Bazaar, at East Mall Drive and East
Sunrise Highway, next to the Casino at Bahamia, is pure 1960s Bahamian
kitsch, and though relentlessly cheerful, it’s a little long in the tooth.
Each area of the 10-acre, 100-shop complex attempts to capture the
ambience of a different region of the globe. Stereotypes abound. Next
door, the Straw Market features, you guessed it, straw baskets, hats,
handbags, and placemats. The Port Lucaya Marketplace, on Seahorse
Road, is a large shopping-and-dining complex much like the International
Bazaar.

Exploring on your own in Nassau
The Nassau/Paradise Island area comprises two separate islands. Nassau
is on the northeastern shore of 21-mile New Providence Island, while tiny
Paradise Island is linked to New Providence by bridges, and protects
Nassau harbor for a 3-mile stretch.
The major attractions and stores are pretty concentrated near the piers,
and if you’re really fit you can even trek over to Cable Beach or Paradise
Island. (Otherwise, it’s no problem finding taxis — they find you.) There’s
no good reason to rent a car here.
Within walking distance: As you exit from the cruise ship wharf into
the main port area, you have no choice but to pass through Festival
Place, a barnlike hall full of little shops and stalls. Outside, hawkers
encourage you to have your hair braided at the government-sponsored
Hairbraider’s Centre.
Shopping is the thing here, but there are a few other sites of interest.
Just across Bay Street from Rawson Square (inland from the wharf) are
the flamingo-pink government buildings of Parliament Square, con-
structed in 1815. The House of Assembly, old colonial Secretary’s Office,
and Supreme Court flank a statue of Queen Victoria, while a bust on the
north side of the square honors Sir Milo B. Butler, the Bahamas’ first
governor-general. One block inland, the pink, octagonal Nassau Public
Library was built as a prison in 1798, and today it holds a collection of
books, historical prints, and more.
Slaves carved the Queen’s Staircase out of a solid limestone cliff in 1793.
Originally designed as an escape route for soldiers, each step now repre-
sents a year in Queen Victoria’s 65-year reign. Lush plants and a water-
fall stand guard over the staircase, which is located a few blocks up from
the library on East Street and leads to Fort Fincastle, Elizabeth Avenue,
built in 1793 by Lord Dunmore, the royal governor. An elevator climbs a
38m (126-ft.) water tower, where you can look down on the fort. Walk
around on your own or hire a guide.
If you have kids in tow, the Pirates of Nassau Museum (King and George
streets; % 242-356-3759; www.pirates-of-nassau.com) is worthwhile.
Admission is a steep $12 for adults — only worth it if you’re with kids, 
as each adult may bring two children under 12 free; each additional
child is $6.
Beyond walking distance: About a mile west of downtown Nassau, just
off West Bay Street, Fort Charlotte is the Bahamas’ largest fort. Built in
1788, it covers more than 100 hilltop acres and offers impressive views
of Paradise Island, Nassau, and the harbor. Nearby, parading pink flamin-
gos are the main attraction at the lush, 5-acre acre Ardastra Gardens,
Zoo and Conservation Center (Chippingham Road; % 242-323-5806;
www.ardastra.com). The graceful birds obey the drillmaster’s orders
daily at 10:30 a.m., 2:10 p.m., and 4:10 p.m. — kids think the whole thing
is a hoot. Admission is $12, $6 children 4 to 12.

If you’re in the mood for some conch, head for Arawak Cay, a small
man-made island across West Bay Street from Ardastra Gardens and Fort
Charlotte. Join the locals in sampling conch with hot sauce, and wash it
down with a cocktail made from coconut water and gin. Farther to the
west, the 3,252-sq.-m (35,000-sq.-ft.) Crystal Palace Casino (West Bay
Street, Cable Beach; % 800-222-7466 or 242-327-6200) is the only casino
on New Providence Island.
On Paradise Island, the towering, fancifully designed Atlantis Paradise
Island megaresort (% 242-363-3000; www.atlantis.com) is the largest
gaming and entertainment complex in the Caribbean. The resort’s
sprawling 11-million-gallon lagoon system boasts more than 200 sea
species and 50,000 individual creatures. The Dig is a fantastic world of
faux Atlantis ruins flooded by the sea. The interconnected passageways,
boulevards, and chambers, now inhabited by piranhas, hammerhead
sharks, stingrays, and morays, are visible through huge glass windows.
In general, cruise ship passengers can check out the casino and shops,
but are not permitted in certain areas of the resort (namely the beaches,
the pools, and the breathtaking water slides). If you sign up for the
guided “Discovery Tour,” you can explore The Dig. Tickets, available at
the resort’s guest services desks, are $29 for adults, $21 for children 4 to
12 (3 and under free). Disney and Royal Caribbean passengers only are
also offered a special day-pass to use Atlantis’s beaches.
Other non-Atlantis beaches are on Paradise Island, all just a ferry ride
away from Prince George Wharf. Paradise Beach is $3 for adults and $1
for children, and includes use of a shower and locker. You may want to
check out smaller beaches as well, including Pirate’s Cove Beach and
Cabbage Beach, the latter of which often fills up with guests of the
nearby resorts.
Five miles from town is Cable Beach, which offers various watersports
and easy access to shops, a casino, bars, and restaurants. Not on the
same level but more convenient for cruise ship passengers, the Western
Esplanade sweeps westward from the Hilton British Colonial hotel, with
changing facilities, restrooms, and a snack bar.
Barbados
In the former British colony of Barbados, cricket is the national pastime,
fish and chips appears on local menus, and people drive on the wrong —
oops, sorry, we mean the left — side of the road. The island is also one
of the most gorgeous in the southern Caribbean, with seemingly endless
stretches of pink- and white-sand beaches, small cottages with well-kept
gardens, and historic parish churches. The most easterly of the
Caribbean islands, its topography varies from rolling hills and savage
waves on the Atlantic coast to densely populated flatlands and the shel-
tered beach/resort areas of the southwest. The northeast part of the
island is hilly, with a morning mist that helped it earn the nickname “The
Scotland District.”
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 311

Predictably, the shopping area near the cruise port in Bridgetown can
get crowded and noisy. You’re better off making a beeline for the beaches
of the Gold Coast, the island’s western side, with luxury resorts fronting
its calm waters.
English is spoken with an island lilt. The Barbados dollar (BD$) is the
official currency (BD$1.98 = US$1; BD$1 = US50¢), but U.S. dollars are
commonly accepted.
Cruising into port
The island’s cruise terminal is located about a mile from the capital,
Bridgetown, and is a veritable shopping mall, with 25 stores and a fleet
of pushcart vendors selling all the usual: jewelry, watches, electronics,
china, crystal, perfumes, blah blah blah. Goods made on Barbados,
including rum, liquors, and jewelry, are duty-free.
You can walk to town in 15 or 20 minutes via the shoreline park.
Otherwise it’s a $4 taxi ride.
Scoring the best excursions
To get to the best locations in Barbados, you need to catch an excursion
or a taxi.
Harrison’s Cave: Barbados’s most popular attraction, all cruise lines
offer various tours here. See “Exploring on your own” for details (two
hours; $52).
Kayak and Turtle Encounter: A boat ride along the west coast brings
you to the beach, where you clamber into your kayak for a 45-minute
paddle along the shore. When at the snorkel site, you can swim with and
feed sea turtles (four hours; $84).
Rainforest Hike and Cave Adventure: A guide leads your group through
one of Barbados’s rain forest gullies, then down into a natural cave (four
hours; $74).
Mount Gay Rum Distillery & Banks Beer Tour: Talk about getting in the
spirit. This tour takes you for a tour and tipple at Barbados’s number-
one rum distillery then heads over to the Banks Brewery for the yeasty
side of things (31⁄2 hours; $42).
Atlantis Submarine Adventure: Sail aboard an air-conditioned sub-
mersible to view underwater life, including tropical fish, plants, and an
intact shipwreck (21⁄2 hours; $99 adults, $59 kids). Note: You can book
this directly with Atlantis Submarine (www.atlantisadventures.com)
and save $10 to $20 off the ticket price.
Exploring on your own
Taxis and car rentals are all available at the cruise terminal. Taxis aren’t
metered, but their rates are fixed by the government. Settle on the fare

before getting in. Buses are frequent and inexpensive (the fare is about
75¢), but they can get crowded at rush hour. As an alternative, look for
minibuses with a “ZR” license plate, which zoom around the island pick-
ing up tourists and locals for about the same price as the bus.

Within walking distance: For some, Bridgetown is within walking dis-
tance; others may opt to take a taxi. Either way, you won’t spend much
time here. For some history, stop in at the Synagogue (Synagogue Lane,
Bridgetown; % 246-432-0840), one of the oldest Jewish houses of wor-
ship in the western hemisphere. Brazilian Jews built the first temple on
this site in 1654; the current building dates to 1833.
Beyond walking distance: The most popular tourist attraction on the
island is Harrison’s Cave (Welchman Hall, St. Thomas; % 246-438-
6640). Electric trams take you down into a series of beautiful coral lime-
stone caverns, full of stalactites, stalagmites, streams, and waterfalls. It’s
about a $20 cab ride from the cruise terminal, and admission costs $16
for adults and $6 for children. Cruise lines typically offer a couple differ-
ent tours that stop here.
Only about a mile from the cave, the Flower Forest (Richmond Plantation,
St. Joseph; % 246-433-8152) is a former sugar plantation that’s now a jun-
glelike botanical garden, with paths winding among huge tropical flowers
and plants. Admission is $7.50.
You can take a bus to reach the lush, tropical garden known as Welchman
Hall Gully, about 8 miles from St. Thomas (% 246-438-6671). Some of 
the plant specimens date back to 1627, when English settlers first arrived.
For example, they say the ancient breadfruit trees grew from seedlings
brought over by Captain Bligh of Mutiny on the Bounty fame. Many of 
the plants are labeled and occasionally you can spot a wild monkey.
Admission is $10.
The 300-year-old Sunbury Plantation House (25 minutes from
Bridgetown along Highway 5; % 246-423-6270) is the only plantation
house on Barbados whose rooms are all open for viewing, featuring
mahogany antiques, old prints, and a collection of horse-drawn car-
riages. Admission is $10.
All beaches in Barbados are open to the public, though those on the
Gold Coast (north of Bridgetown) have calmer waters, and are closer 
to the port to boot. Paynes Bay, about a $9 cab ride from the port, is
excellent for swimming, snorkeling, and other watersports, but can get
crowded. Directly south of Paynes Bay, even closer to the port, Brighton
Beach, Brandon’s Beach, and Paradise Beach are all fine alternatives,
clustered around Fresh Water Bay. Farther north, Church Point can get
crowded, but it’s one of the most scenic bays in Barbados, and the swim-
ming is ideal.
The British Virgin Islands
Once upon a time, the British Virgin Islands served as a haven for
pirates, but today they’re a haven for sun-seekers. Most of the 40-some
islands that make up the island group are quite small. Cruise ships stop
at the largest three: Tortola, Virgin Gorda (or “Fat Virgin,” so named by
Christopher Columbus, which has got to make you wonder), and the
less-frequented and very rustic Jost Van Dyke.

The British Virgin Islands
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 315

Treasure Island fans get a kick out of Norman Island, said to be the set-
ting for Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic tale. Legend holds that the
notorious pirate Blackbeard stashed a bottle of rum and marooned 15
men at Deadman Bay on neighboring Peter Island, inspiring the famous
“yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum” ditty.
Although their official name is the British Virgin Islands, the U.S. dollar is
the official currency. Go figure. English is the official language.
Cruising into port
Most large ships sail into Tortola, docking at Wickhams Cay, a pleasant
five-minute walk to Main Street in Road Town. If more than two ships are
in port, the latecomers have to anchor offshore and bring passengers in
by tender. Virgin Gorda doesn’t have a pier or landing facilities for large
ships. Most that stop at Tortola offer excursions to Virgin Gorda instead.
Smaller vessels may anchor offshore and tender passengers in to St.
Thomas Bay, the port area and yacht harbor for Spanish Town. Ferries
from Tortola also berth here. Some small ships visit hilly, 4-square-mile
Jost Van Dyke, tendering passengers in for a beach day.
Scoring the best excursions
Tortola is the only one of the Virgin Islands where it makes sense to take
an excursion — and some of those excursions go to the other Virgin
Islands.
Virgin Gorda and the Baths: Travel by boat from Tortola across the Sir
Francis Drake Channel to Spanish Town, on Virgin Gorda, then board
open-air buses to the Baths for sunning, swimming, and snorkeling amid
mammoth boulders and sea caves (for more details, see the following
section “Exploring on your own in Virgin Gorda”). Includes a Caribbean-
style buffet lunch (four hours; $62).
Town and Country Excursion: Tour Tortola in an open-air minibus, visit-
ing the Botanical Gardens, Cane Garden Bay, Bomba’s Full Moon Party
Shack, and Soper’s Hole (for more description, see the next section,
“Exploring on your own in Tortola”) (31⁄2 hours; $34).
Tortola Snorkeling Adventure: Cross the Sir Frances Drake Channel by
boat to Norman Island, one of the BVI’s prime snorkel sites, full of coral
formations, colorful fish, and a group of caves at Treasure Point, where
pirate loot is said to have been hidden (three hours; $52).
Forest Walk and Beach Tour: Safari buses take you to Tortola’s interior
for a mile-long hike through the Sage Mountain rain forest to the highest
point in the Virgin Islands, followed by a brief stop at the Botanical
Gardens (41⁄2 hours; $46).
Exploring on your own in Tortola
Tortola is the largest and busiest of the British Virgin Islands. Its capital,
Road Town, is a popular yachting center as well as the port for cruise
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
316

ships. The rest of the southern coast is characterized by rugged moun-
tain peaks, while the north coast has beautiful white-sand beaches
fringed with palm trees, bananas, and mangoes.
Whether your ship docks or tenders passengers in, you end up right in
town, about a five-minute walk to Main Street. Open-air and sedan-style
taxis meet every arriving ship to carry passengers to the beaches and
other attractions. Fares are set, so ask how much before you get in. If
you want to rent a car, Budget, Hertz, and Avis all have offices here.
Within walking distance: You can walk from the pier to Tortola’s Main
Street, which has a relatively quiet shopping area by Caribbean stan-
dards, although you can get some good bargains on duty-free British
goods such as English china. Across from the dock on the waterfront is
Pusser’s Road Town Pub (% 284-494-3897), with an extensive menu
and the infamous Pusser’s Rum, which was served aboard British Navy
ships for over 300 years. The attached company store offers a selection
of clothing and other logo items, some pretty cool.
Beyond walking distance: Drive or take a taxi to 92-acre Sage Mountain
National Park, where the namesake mountain soars to a magnificent
1,780 feet amid a lush tropical rain forest setting, which you can explore
via nature trails. (You can pick up a trail map at the tourist office in the
center of Road Town near the dock just south of Wickhams Cay.) The
park was established in 1964 to protect what was left of Tortola’s original
forests, following the depredations of the plantation era.
Most of Tortola’s beaches are a 20-minute taxi ride from the cruise dock,
costing about $15 per person each way (or less if you’ve got a group)
Discuss price with the driver before setting out, and ask him to pick 
you up later, in time to get back to the ship. The best beach is at Cane
Garden Bay on the island’s northwest side, across the mountains from
Road Town but worth the trip. Surfers like Apple Bay, also on the north-
west side, while next-door Cappoon’s Bay is known more for Bomba’s
Surfside Shack (% 284-495-4148), a legendary island bar built from what
looks like scrap lumber and covered in day-glo graffiti. Painkillers — one
of the Caribbean’s legendary rum drinks — are a specialty. If you want to
snorkel, the best beaches on Tortola are Smugglers Cove, on the western
tip, and Brewer’s Bay, on the northwest side.
Exploring on your own in Virgin Gorda
Instead of heading for Tortola, some smaller ships anchor outside of
Virgin Gorda and bring visitors ashore by tender. You have to take a taxi
to get there, but The Baths is the most popular beach destination on 
the island, looking like something Frank Gehry would have designed had
he lived during the Neolithic age. It’s a group of house-sized boulders,
which geologists believe toppled onto one another as a result of ice-age
eruptions, forming the dramatic shapes and saltwater grottoes we see

fall over and crush you, but of course don’t. A cafe sits just above the
beach.
Spring Bay, just north of The Baths, is a great white-sand beach with
clear water and good snorkeling. Farther north still, Trunk Bay is a wide
sand beach reachable via a rough path from Spring Bay. Devil’s Bay, just
south of The Baths, is a less crowded swimming option.
Exploring on your own in Jost Van Dyke
Jost Van Dyke is visited mostly by private yachts and a few small cruise
ships such as those of Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, which often throws
afternoon beach parties on the beach at White Bay. If your ship stays
late, head to Foxy’s (% 284-495-9258), a legendary beach bar at the far
end of Great Harbour. It’s a scene.
Cozumel and Playa del Carmen, Mexico
Woooo-ey, is Cozumel ever a busy place. Located just off Mexico’s
Yucatán coast, it gets up to 16 ships visiting every single day during high
season. Do the math; that’s something like 25,000 cruise passengers
tromping down the gangways. Zowie. The island’s main town, San Miguel
(located on the island’s western shore, where the best resorts and
beaches are also found), is tourist central, despite the thorough thrash-
ing by Hurricane Wilma in late 2005. The first ships returned to the port
only a month after the storm hit, though at press time, the place wasn’t
completely back to normal. By the time you read this, though, you proba-
bly won’t be able to tell what hit the place, as the town’s stores, bars, 
and restaurants are mostly humming along again. Go beyond the main
Cozumel tourist zone, and things calm way down.
Playa del Carmen, on the mainland, is much quieter, with a small but
expanding shopping district, some trendy boutiques and hip restau-
rants, and beaches. Mostly it’s a jumping-off point for excursions and
treks to the mainland’s main draws: the Mayan ruins of Tulum, Chichén
Itzá, and Cobá, plus a couple of water parks. Some ships spend one day
in Cozumel and the next in Playa, though more frequently they just run
boats from Cozumel to the mainland, 45 minutes away. There’s also a
regular ferry service, if you want to go on your own.
In recent years, a handful of other Yucatán ports have come onto the
scene, including Calica, just south of Playa; Costa Maya, about 161km
(100 miles) south near the sleepy fishing village of Mahajual; and
Progreso, on the Gulf coast of the Yucatán, making it the closest to both
Chichén Itzá and the city of Merida. Costa Maya is the most elaborate of
the three, with shopping, entertainment, beaches and beach bars, and
activities. The others are little more than piers giving easier access to
the other Yucatán attractions.
Spanish is the language of Mexico, although English is spoken by nearly
everyone you deal with in the tourist zone. The Mexican currency is the

nuevo peso (new peso). Its symbol is the “$” sign, but the exchange rate
is about $11 pesos to US$1 ($1 peso = about US9¢). The main tourist
stores accept U.S. dollars.
Cruising into port
Hurricane Wilma did a number on Cozumel’s cruise piers when it hit in
October 2005. The Puerto Maya pier, about three miles south of tourist
hub San Miguel, was completely destroyed, while the busy International
Pier, a bit closer to town, suffered enormous structural damage. San
Miguel’s centrally located Punta Langosta cruise pier fared best of the
three, but was still put out of commission. At press time, ships had to
anchor offshore and bring passengers in by tender, but tremendous
efforts are underway to rebuild all three piers, with reopening targeted
for early to mid-2007.
Both Puerto Maya and the International Pier lie about a $10 taxi ride
from town. The beaches are close to the International Pier.
Scoring the best excursions
The Mayan ruins on the mainland are, in our opinion, an absolute must.
Because all ruins involve some traveling (especially from Cozumel), we
recommend visiting as part of an excursion. In addition to the ruins,
cruise lines always offer snorkeling, horseback riding, booze-cruising,
folkloric shows, dolphin swims, submarine and scuba dives, ATV off-
roading, bicycle treks, parasailing, kayaking, fishing, and more.
Tulum Mayan Ruins/Xel-Ha: About a 30-minute drive from Playa del
Carmen, the small walled city of Tulum is usually the only ruin of conse-
quence you can visit if you’re coming from Cozumel. It was the only
Mayan city built right on the coast and the only one still inhabited when
the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 1500s. In the company of a
trained guide, you visit some of the 60 individual structures, including a
temple to Kukulkán, the primary Mayan/Olmec god. The Tulum tour is
sold either on its own (61⁄2 hours; $79) or in combination with a visit to
the Xel-Ha Eco Park (eight hours; $109), a natural lagoon where you can
drift from one end to the other in an inner tube, accompanied by schools
of tropical fish. Snorkeling gear is available, as is a swim-with-dolphins
option (for an extra cost).
Chichén Itzá: The most fabled of the Yucatán ruins, Chichén Itzá was
founded in A.D. 445 and at its height was home to about 50,000 residents.
All told, it’s absolutely huge, covering an area of 7 square miles, though
tours visit only a fraction of that, which is enough. The best known of
Chichén Itzá’s ruins is the magnificent El Castillo pyramid (also called
the Pyramid of Kukulkán), with four 91-step outside stairways leading up
to a central platform. Do the math and the steps add up to the number
of days in the solar year (91×4 = 364, plus one for the central platform).
On the spring and fall equinoxes, light striking the pyramid gives the illu-
sion of a snake slithering down the steps to join its gigantic stone head
mounted at the base. Typical tours also visit a sports court where the

captain of the losing (or winning — nobody knows) team was sacrificed
to the gods. Other stops include a well where virgins were sacrificed,
and a temple where (guess!) other folks were sacrificed. They were big
on sacrifices, those Mayans. Kidding aside, it’s an absolutely incredible
place, and one of the best excursions we’ve ever taken. Due to its dis-
tance into the Yucatán interior, this tour is typically offered only by
ships calling at one of the mainland ports (12 hours; $149).
Cobá: A 35-minute drive inland from Tulum puts you at Cobá, once the
commercial hub of the Mayan civilization, flourishing from A.D. 300 to
1000. Today, more than 3,500 structures have been identified on its
grounds, which are bounded by four natural lakes. Excavation work
began in 1972, but only a fraction of the city has been reclaimed from 
the jungle. Cobá’s pyramid, Nohoch Mul, is the tallest in the Yucatán.
Excursions travel here from both Cozumel and Playa (eight hours; $89).
Xcaret: From Cozumel, you transfer by ferry to Playa del Carmen then
by bus to this unique eco-archaeological theme park, whose name is pro-
nounced ish-car-et. You have about 31⁄2 hours on site to enjoy the park’s
blue lagoons, lazy rivers, botanical gardens, aviary, aquarium, and cul-
tural performances. The highlight of this visit is the underground river
tour, which involves donning a float-vest and letting a gentle current
carry you along a crystal river through an underground cave. This tour
is offered from both Cozumel and Playa (eight hours; $88).
Exploring on your own in Cozumel
Depending on where you dock, you can either walk right into the tourist
throng or take a short taxi ride to it — or away from it, depending on
your preference. The typical fare from the farthest piers to downtown
San Miguel is about $10 From San Miguel to most resorts and beaches 
is usually between $15 and $25. Be sure to settle on the fare before you
start out. Many passengers also rent mopeds from one of many, many
vendors. The cost is usually about $35 per day, including helmet.
To get far away, you can take the ferry from Cozumel to Playa del Carmen
for $9 per person. The crossing takes approximately 45 minutes.
Within walking distance: The things to do in central San Miguel are
shopping and drinking, both of which can easily be done on foot —
either solidly or canted sideways, depending on how much you imbibe.
Avenida Rafael Melgar runs along the waterfront and is chockablock
with shops, bars, and restaurants. Ditto for the streets around the Plaza
del Sol, which lies just behind Avenida Melgar, at the foot of the ferry
pier. Shops sell the usual tourist goods, Mexican crafts, and especially
silver jewelry, which is generally sold by weight. Prices are relatively
high, but you can and should bargain. If you dock at the International
Pier, a bunch of nice shops in the terminal sell everything from Mexican
blankets to jewelry, T-shirts, and handicrafts of all kinds. The pier at
Puerta Maya also has a number of well-stocked gift shops.
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 321

Beyond walking distance: The Chankanaab Nature Park (www.
cozumelparks.com.mx) is a wildlife sanctuary, archaeological park, 
cultural park, and water park all in one. Just 10 minutes from the down-
town pier by taxi (about $15), you can swim in a saltwater lagoon with 
a beautiful powder-white beach, snorkel or scuba among fish-filled off-
shore reefs (equipment rentals are available), stroll through the botani-
cal garden, walk around a replica Mayan village, go to the interactive
archaeological museum, take in a sea lion show, or see dolphins perform
at the Dolphinarium. To swim with the dolphins, make reservations 
in advance at Dolphin Discovery in Cancún (% 998-849-4757; www.
dolphindiscovery.com/cozumel). Park admission is $11 adults, $6
kids 3 to 11. Dolphin swims are $155.
Mayan ruins on Cozumel are very minor compared to those on the main-
land, but if you’re driving around you can visit San Gervasio (north of
San Miguel), once a ceremonial center and capital, and El Cedral (to 
the south), site of a Mayan arch and a few small ruins covered in heavy
growth. Cozumel’s best beach, Playa San Francisco, is only 2 miles from
El Cedral. Another mile or so south is Playa Mia (formerly called Playa
del Sol), one of the island’s more popular, crowded, and loud beaches.
Its been built up with bars, restaurants, water sport rentals, and a mini
zoo, and charges a $12 entrance fee.
Exploring on your own in Playa del Carmen
Within walking distance: Playa del Carmen is much more low-key than
Cozumel. From the ferry dock you can walk to the white-sand beach or
explore the ever-expanding shopping district, which has numerous
shops, bars, and restaurants. For shopping, stroll the Rincon del Sol, a
tree-lined Mexican colonial-style courtyard with some appealing local
handicrafts stores. If you’re hankering for a beer (or three), head to
Señor Frog’s (% 984-873-0930), right at the ferry pier, or Carlos ’n
Charlie’s (% 984-803-3498), just up the street.
Beyond walking distance: For all attractions beyond town, see the pre-
ceding section “Scoring the best excursions.”
Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles
Curaçao (pronounced coo-ra-sow) is the largest and most populous of
the Netherlands Antilles — the so-called ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire,
Curaçao) located about 35 miles north of the Venezuelan coast. A Dutch
possession since the 17th century, it has served over the years as a trad-
ing post, oil-refining center, and tourist destination. Today, it retains its
Dutch flavor, especially in the capital of Willemstad. When your ship
arrives at Willemstad’s harbor, you can watch the town’s famous floating
bridge swing aside (which was out of the water for repairs at press time,
but should be back when you read this) and invite you into a narrow
channel, where rows of centuries-old pastel-colored homes create a
fairy-tale effect. Contrasting with this quaint and colorful architecture,
the rest of the desertlike island may remind you of the southwestern
United States.

Curaçao
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 323
Dutch, Spanish, and English are all spoken on Curaçao. The official cur-
rency is the Netherlands Antillean florin (NAf), also called a guilder
(US$1 = 1.77 NAf; 1 NAf = US56¢). Most places accept U.S. dollars for 
purchases.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships dock in Willemstad at a megapier just beyond the Queen
Emma pontoon bridge. It has a tourist information booth, car rental
agencies, duty-free shopping, and workshop space for local artists. Just
beyond the bridge is the famous Floating Market (see the following 

section “Exploring on your own”). The adjacent fort houses Riffort
Village, a shopping/entertainment complex.
Scoring the best excursions
Spanish Water Canoe and Snorkeling: Board canoes at Caracas Bay
Island for a 45-minute paddle alongside mangroves and rock formations.
At Baya Beach, instructors lead snorkeling excursions over a sunken tug-
boat (31⁄2 hours; $69).
Exploring Curaçao’s Jewish Heritage: Jews have lived in Curaçao since
the mid-17th century. On this tour, participants visit the Mikve Emmanuel
Israel synagogue (the western hemisphere’s oldest) as well as Beth Haim
Cemetery (consecrated in 1659) and Landhouse Bloemhof, with its col-
lections of art and artifacts from Curacao’s Jewish past (31⁄2 hours; $52).
Exploring on your own
From the pier, it’s just a five- to ten-minute walk across the Queen Emma
pontoon bridge to the city’s principal shopping and business areas. You
can “do” Willemstad on foot in two or three hours, which leaves you
plenty of time for beaches or watersports. Taxi drivers waiting at the
cruise dock can take you to any of the beaches. Fares are fixed, so ask the
driver what the rate is to your destination is before you set out. If you
want him to pick you up again later, just inquire. If you want a taxi tour,
you can share with up to four passengers total for about $30 per hour.
You can also get around the island by two kinds of buses. Take either a
van (easily recognizable by the word BUS on the license plate) or one of
the yellow or blue buses called konvoi. Yellow buses run from Wilhelmina
Plein (near the shopping center) to most parts of the island. Fares to any
point are under $2.
Within walking distance: Boats from Venezuela, Colombia, and other
Caribbean islands dock at the Floating Market, a short walk from the
Queen Emma pontoon bridge. Here, amid a bustling crowd, vendors sell
fresh fish, tropical fruits, spices, and crafts. Nearby, you can trace the
island’s history through the exhibits at the Curaçao Maritime Museum,
Van den Brandhof Street (% 5-999-465-2327; www.curacaomaritime.
com).
The oldest Jewish congregation in the New World gathers in the 1651
Mikve Israel Emanuel Synagogue (at the corner of Columbusstraat and
Hanchi Snog). White sand covers the floor, symbolic of the desert that
the early Israelites roamed. Next door, the Jewish Cultural Historical
Museum (Hanchi Snoa 29; % 599-9-461-1633; www.snoa.com) is housed
in two buildings dating from 1728. They were the rabbi’s residence and
the mikvah (bath) for religious purification purposes. Entry is through
the synagogue and admission is about $2.
The Curaçao Museum, Van Leeuwenhoekstraat (% 599-9-462-3873), is
housed in a restored 1853 building constructed by the Royal Dutch Army
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
324

as a military hospital. Today, it displays paintings, objets d’art, and
antique furniture, as well as a large collection from the Caiquetio tribes.
Admission is $3.25.
Housed in a former slave yard and prison, Museum Kura Hulanda
(Klipstraat 9; % 599-9-434-7765; www.kurahulanda.com) is an anthro-
pological museum that focuses on the predominant cultures of Curaçao,
chronicling the African slave trade, West African empires, pre-Colombian
gold, Mesopotamian relics, and Antillean art. You reach the museum via
small boats that cross the harbor. Admission is about $6.
Beyond walking distance: Home to more than 400 species of fish and
plant life, the Curaçao Seaquarium (off Bhpor Kibra, just east of
Willemstad; % 599-9-465-8900; www.curacao-sea-aquarium.com)
offers divers, snorkelers, and experienced swimmers a chance to feed,
film, and photograph sharks, stingrays, lobsters, and other marine life in
a controlled environment. If you don’t swim, a 46-foot semi-submersible
observatory enables you to watch the underwater action. If you don’t do
semi-submersibles, the Seaquarium also maintains the island’s only full-
facility, palm-shaded, sugar-white beach. The facility is about a ten-
minute, $8 cab ride from Queen Emma pontoon bridge. Admission is $15
for adults and $7.50 for children under 14.
A 40-minute taxi ride west of Willemstad, you can see cacti, bromeliads,
rare orchids, iguanas, donkeys, wild goats, and many species of birds 
in 4,500-acre Christoffel National Park (near the northwestern tip of
Curaçao; % 599-9-864-0363). The park rises from flat, arid countryside
to 1,230-foot St. Christoffelberg, the tallest point in the Dutch Leewards.
Hiking along several trails to the top of the mountain, you find Arawak
paintings and the Piedra di Monton, a rock heap piled by African slaves
who cleared this former plantation. Legend says slaves could climb to
the top of the rock pile, jump off, and fly back home across the Atlantic
to Africa. The park has 20 miles of one-way trail-like roads for driving
tours and several hiking trails that go to the top of the mountain. It takes
about 11⁄2 hours to walk to the top. Admission is $9.
Next to Christoffel National Park, National Park Shete Boka (Seven
Inlets in the Papiamentu language) encompasses rugged seaside cliffs
carved in dramatic patterns. The highlight is Boka Tabla, a wide cavern
carved by millions of years of pounding surf. The place is also a turtle
sanctuary. Admission is about $1.50.
If you want to explore the island’s deeper side, head to Hato Caves (F. D.
Rooseveltweg; % 599-9-868-0379). Originally a coral reef, the limestone
formations were created over thousands of years by water seeping
through the coral and pushing it upward. After crossing the lake, you
enter two caverns known as “The Cathedral” and La Ventana (“The
Window”), where you see samples of ancient Indian petroglyphs. Local
guides take visitors through every hour. Admission is $6.25 for adults,
$4.75 for kids under 13.
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 325

Curaçao has 38 beaches, but they’re pretty mediocre compared to
others in the Caribbean. The Curaçao Seaquarium has the island’s only
full-facility, white-sand, palm-shaded beach, but you have to pay the full
aquarium admission to get in (see the preceding section “Exploring on
your own”). The rest of the beaches are public and include Santa
Barbara Beach, south of Willemstad; Blauwbaai (Blue Bay), just west of
the city; and Playa Abao, Knip Bay, and other stretches way up near the
island’s western tip.
Dominica
Tiny Dominica (pronounced dome-ee-nee-ka), sandwiched between
Guadeloupe and Martinique, is the most lush and mountainous island in
the eastern Caribbean. About 29 miles long and 16 wide, it’s blessed with
astonishing natural wonders, including lush rain forests, crystal-pure
rivers, and dramatic waterfalls. Volcanic coral reefs, every bit as biologi-
cally complex as the rain forests onshore, ring the island, and a bit far-
ther from land, whales mate and calve. No wonder they call this “the
nature island of the Caribbean.” On the downside, the island’s capital,
Roseau, is a little rough around the edges, and the island’s shore lacks
the kind of sugar-white beaches many folks associate with the Caribbean.
That isn’t the point of Dominica, though. Here, it’s all about nature, with a
little bit of the most authentic Caribbean culture mixed in: up in the
island’s northeast live about 3,000 Carib Indians, the last remaining
descendants of the people who dominated the region when Europeans
arrived, and gave it its name.
The Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$2.70 = US$1; EC$1 = US37¢) is the offi-
cial currency, but merchants accept the U.S. dollar virtually everywhere.
The official language is English, but most people also speak Creole.
Cruising into port
Dominica has two cruise ship ports. The most frequented is in the heart of
Roseau, the country’s capital and largest town, with banks, restaurants, a
market, a tourism office, and the Dominica Museum all within spitting dis-
tance. The other is near the northwestern town of Portsmouth, closer to
attractions such as Cabrits National Park and Fort Shirley (see the follow-
ing section “Exploring on your own”).
Scoring the best excursions
Trafalgar Falls and Emerald Pool Nature Tour: Drive to Morne Bruce
for a panoramic view of Roseau and visit the Botanical Gardens. Proceed
to a lookout point for a fantastic view of Trafalgar Falls before driving
into the interior, where you walk 15 minutes along a relatively easy trail
to the Emerald Pool, named for the moss-covered boulders that enclose
it. You can swim if you like, floating on your back under the rain forest
canopy and 50-foot waterfall (41⁄2 hours; $52).
Home of the Carib Indians: Located on Dominica’s northeastern coast,
the 3,700-acre Carib Territory is home to the world’s last surviving

population of Carib Indians. The Caribs today live like most other rural
islanders — growing bananas and coconuts, fishing, and operating small
shops — but they maintain cultural and artistic traditions that bind
them to their past. On your visit, the tribe’s chief will acquaint you with
Carib history, and you get to see a performance by the Karifuna Cultural
Group (five hours; $59).
Dominica by Jeep and Swimming at the Titou Gorge: A jeep convoy
heads up Morne Bruce for a picturesque view, stopping at the Botanical
Gardens and the Wotten Waven Sulpher Springs before arriving at the

volcanic Titou Gorge for a swim among sheer 20-foot black walls, rock
outcrops, caves, and a thundering waterfall (31⁄2 hours; $89).
Layou Gorge River Tubing: Tubing guides take you downriver through
the Layou Valley, lined with tall, overhanging cliffs and lush vegetation
(three hours; $69).
Rain Forest Aerial Tram: A 4,600-foot tram offers a scenic 70-minute
journey through the treetops, over streams and waterfalls, and across
the Breakfast River Gorge (three hours; $114).
Exploring on your own
Fleets of taxis and public minivans await cruise ship passengers at the
dock. All are designated by a “HA” or “H” on the license plate. Drivers are
generally knowledgeable about sites and history, and the standard sight-
seeing rate is from $20 per site per person. The vehicles are unmetered,
so negotiate a price in advance.
Within walking distance: On the bay front at the dock in Roseau is the
Dominica Museum, located in an old market house dating from 1810. Its
permanent exhibit illustrates the island’s geology, history, archeology,
economy, and culture. Admission is $3. Behind the museum is Old Market
Square, where merchants have gathered for centuries. At one time, it was
also the site for executions, slave auctions, and political rallies. Now, you
find Dominican crafts and souvenirs for sale. At Tropicrafts, at the corner
of Queen Mary Street and Turkey Lane, watch local women weave intri-
cate grass mats and browse for Carib baskets, locally made soaps and toi-
letries, rums, jellies, condiments, woodcarvings, and masks made from
the trunks of giant fougère ferns.
On the eastern edge of Roseau, also within walking distance of the
docks, the Botanical Gardens lie at the base of Morne Bruce, the moun-
tain overlooking the town. The gardens were established at the end of
the 19th century, and about 150 of the 500 original species of trees and
shrubs remain. Keep your eyes out for the Carib Wood tree, whose red
blossom is the island’s national flower (in bloom Mar–May).
The cruise ship dock at Portsmouth leads directly to the 260-acre
Cabrits National Park (it takes 45–60 minutes to drive here from the
Roseau dock, and a cab is $60). The park boasts dazzling mountain
scenery, tropical forests, swamplands, volcanic sand beaches, coral
reefs, and the ruins of Fort Shirley, an 18th-century garrison. Some of
the park has been partly reconstructed, but keep an eye out for stone
walls and cannons hidden among vegetation along the trails. You can
spend a whole day touring the park, so wear good walking shoes.
Admission is $2.
Beyond walking distance: About 15 to 20 minutes by cab from Roseau
is Trafalgar Falls, two separate cascades that tumble side by side. A
short trail from the road brings you to a viewing platform where you see
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why

the two falls converge into rocky pools. You can take a dip in the brisk
water at the base of the falls, but be careful, the rocks are slippery.
If you’re looking for a hardcore workout and a look at nature in the raw,
hike from the Valley of Desolation to Boiling Lake. Experienced guides
say this six-hour march is like spending hours on a maximally resistant
Stairmaster. Definitely do this trek with a guide and be prepared to
breathe in plenty of sulfuric fumes and bathe in the steam that rises
from cracks in the earth. The final destination on this flashback to pre-
historic times is a wide cauldron of bubbling, slate-blue water of
unknown depth.
Beaches — featuring plenty of rocks and dark, volcanic sand — are not
Dominica’s strong point, but the island’s top choices are Hampstead
Beach, Hodges Beach, L’Ance Noire, and Woodford Bay, all on the
northern coast, about 20 minutes from Roseau.
Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands
Mostly scrubland and swamp, Grand Cayman and its sister islands
(Cayman Brac and Little Cayman) are anything but lush. Still, the island
boasts its share of upscale, expensive private homes and condos, owned
by millionaire expatriates from all over who come because of the tiny
nation’s lenient tax and banking laws. For tourists, Grand Cayman is
known most for what’s offshore — spectacular coral reefs that make for
some really great diving and snorkeling. The island also has a nice
stretch of sand, Seven Mile Beach, that fronts a strip of high-rise hotels.
If all you care about is shopping, you’re in luck. George Town, the British
colony’s capital and place where you land when your ship calls here, has
its fair share of brand-name stores.
English is the official language of the islands. The legal tender is the
Cayman Islands dollar (CI84¢ = US$1; CI$1 = US$1.19), but U.S. dollars
are commonly accepted. Be sure to note which currency price tags refer
to before making a purchase.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships anchor off George Town and ferry their passengers to a pier
on Harbour Drive, right in the midst of George Town’s thriving shopping
district.
If seas are choppy, which happens fairly often, the piers may be closed
and your cruise may be forced to skip the port altogether.
Scoring the best excursions
Stingray City: The waters off Grand Cayman are home to Stingray City,
one of the world’s wackiest underwater attractions. Set in the very shal-
low waters of North Sound, about 2 miles east of the island’s northwest-
ern tip, the site was discovered in the mid-1980s when local fishermen
noticed that scores of stingrays were showing up to feed on the offal

they dumped overboard. Today, anywhere from 30 to 100 relatively tame
stingrays swarm around the hundreds of oohing and aahing snorkelers
like so many aquatic basset hounds, eager for handouts. Stingrays are
terribly gentle creatures, and love to have their bellies rubbed, but
never try to grab one by the tail — their barbed stingers can inflict a lot
of pain (two to three hours; $49–$59).
Atlantis Submarine: A 48-passenger sub takes you down to 100 feet
through coral canyons, with an automatic fish feeder drawing swarms of
colorful marine creatures (11⁄2 hours, including a 45-minute dive; $95).
Grand Cayman by Bicycle: Hop on a bike to work off all that cruise
food, and check out the island’s coastline to boot. Pick up your touring
mountain bike at the Beach Club Colony Hotel, ride along the coastline
for views of Seven Mile Beach, and then journey inland en route to the
north side of the island to ride along the coast again (three hours; $69).

Exploring on your own
Taxis line up at the pier to meet cruise ship passengers. Fares are fixed;
typical one-way fares range from $12 to $20. Motor scooters and bicycles
are another way to get around. Island Scooter Rental (% 345-949-2046),
at Bernard Drive in Industrial Park, offers shuttle service to/from George
Town and rents scooters for $30 a day.
Within walking distance: Hey, like, it isn’t only about shopping. In
George Town, check out the small but interesting Cayman Islands
National Museum (Harbour Drive; % 345-949-8368; www.museum.ky).
Exhibits include Caymanian artifacts collected by Ira Thompson (begin-
ning in the 1930s), and other items relating to the natural, social, and
cultural history of the Caymans. Admission is $5 ($2.50 seniors); closed
Sundays. The museum was closed for renovation at press time, but is
expected to reopen by year-end 2006
Beyond walking distance: The only green-sea-turtle farm of its kind in
the world, Cayman Turtle Farm, at Northwest Point, just beyond the
town of Hell (% 345-949-3894; www.turtle.ky), is the island’s most
popular land-based tourist attraction. Once a multitude of turtles lived in
the waters surrounding the Cayman Islands, but today these creatures
are endangered. The turtle farm’s purpose is twofold: to replenish the
waters with hatchlings and yearling turtles, and to provide the local
market with edible turtle meat. You can peer into 100 circular concrete
tanks containing turtles ranging in size from 6 ounces to 600 pounds, and
sample turtle dishes at a snack bar and restaurant. If all goes according
to plan, the turtle farm will soon be part of a 23-acre marine park called
Boatswain’s Beach (pronounced “bo-suns”; www.boatswainsbeach.ky),
which will also include a snorkeling lagoon, a predator tank full of sharks
and moray eels, a separate tank for dolphin swims, an aviary, a nature
trail, and other mostly marine-oriented displays. It’s currently scheduled
to open after this book goes to press.
And now, we’d like to tell you to go to Hell! Now don’t get all offended
on us; it’s actually the name of a little town and a great place to buy
some souvenir T-shirts for your most despised friends back home. 
You can also mail your postcards from here for the snarky postmark.
If you just want to flop on a towel and fry your skin, head for Seven Mile
Beach, a strip of white sand just north of George Town. Lined with con-
dominiums and plush resorts, it’s an easy taxi ride from the cruise dock.
Watersports are available, and so are lots of lunch places.
Do the right thing and don’t purchase turtle or black-coral products.
They’re sold everywhere, but it’s illegal to bring them back into the
United States and most other Western nations.
Grand Turk
If Carnival needs a new port, it builds one. That’s what basically hap-
pened in the case of Grand Turk, which “opened” in February 2006;

ships had visited the island in the past, but never in any great numbers.
Carnival Corporation was the main player behind the project, leasing 37
acres from the government and developing just 14 of them, building a
transportation center, restaurant, shopping area, craft stalls, fountains,
and duty-free building. The deepwater pier can handle the largest mega-
ships, eliminating the need to tender thousands of passengers back and
forth to the island. Though backed by Carnival Corporation, other lines
will use the cruise center as well. The bigwigs estimate the island will
get about 370,000 cruisers a year by the end of 2007 — about a hundred
times as many people as actually live on the island.
Let’s just hope they don’t all decide to go snorekling at the same time.
Grand Turk has long been known as a one of the top five diving destina-
tions in the world, with healthy coral reefs and great visibility. The
whole western shore of the island is a protected underwater park.
About 3 miles from the pier is downtown Cockburn Town, a sleepy half-
mile stretch that also happens to be the administrative capital of The
Turks and Caicos Islands. Along its streets, Bermudan-influenced colo-
nial buildings mix with simple gift shops, guest houses, and a couple of
laid back bars, plus miles of public, powder-white sand beaches. A bit
neglected over the years, it received a $7 million facelift courtesy of big
sugar daddy Carnival Corporation.
English is the official language of the islands. The legal tender is the U.S.
dollar, but there’s a local currency called the TCI crown (of equal value
with the dollar) and a quarter, either of which make nice souvenirs.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships pull right up to the docks at the Grand Turk Cruise Center,
on the south side of Grand Turk. You could easily spend your whole 
day hanging out at the cruise center, with its two-story, 17,000 sq. ft.
Margaritaville Café, and a giant swimming pool with swim up bar, slide,
cabanas, and infinity-edge view. The pool’s only 31⁄2 feet deep, so it’s ideal
for families with younger kids.
Scoring the best shore excursions
Scuba Diving: You won’t get any better conditions anywhere in the
Caribbean than Grand Turk, with its tranquil, crystal clear waters and pro-
tected reef. Experienced divers will be wowed by the manta rays, whale
sharks, sea turtles, and the beautiful colors of the third largest coral reef
in the world. Resort courses are offered as well (21⁄2–4 hours; $109–$119).
Snorkeling: Excursions typically visit two sites, usually Horseshoe Reef
(with depths averaging 6–12 ft.) and a reef off Round Cay, one of Grand
Turk’s best dive locations (21⁄2 hours; $49).
Grand Turk Helmet Dive: Yet another way of getting underwater is via 
a helmet dive, in which a helmet provides a constant air supply as you
walk around on the ocean floor (two hours; $109).
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 333

Grand Turk Semi-Sub: If you don’t want to mess up your hair, sign up for
this semi-submersible excursion, where you travel 8 feet below the sur-
face to view sea life and Grand Turk’s famous coral reefs (one hour; $49).
Whale watching tours are also be offered on an ad-hoc basis. It has to
be the right season and the right weather, but the Atlantic humpback
whales travel down Turk’s Passage trench on the western side of the
island every year, heading for their breeding grounds south of Grand
Turk, where they take care of their calves from January to April.
Exploring on your own
Taxis line up at the pier to meet cruise ship passengers. Fares are fixed;
typical one-way fares to Cockburn Town run $10 per taxi, plus $4 extra
per person. There’s no public transportation on the island, but one
shore excursion offered by the cruise lines is a bus loop in which you
can hop off and on at will.
Within walking distance: Cockburn Town’s historic district is centered
along Duke and Front streets. Wood and limestone houses line the water-
front, while historic government buildings surround a small plaza where
canons and a bronze plaque mark the spot where Christopher Columbus
allegedly first set foot in the new world, on October 14, 1492. Columbus’s
logbook notes landfall at a bean-shaped island, but there’s no absolute
proof that that bean was Grand Turk.
Also on Front Street is the Turks & Caicos National Museum (% 649-
946-2160; www.tcmuseum.org). Housed in 180-year-old Guinep House, the
museum includes wreckage from a Spanish caravel that sank in shallow
offshore water sometime before 1513. Admission is $5. Closed Sundays.
Just behind Cockburn Town’s historic waterfront is the town’s saltwater
pond, and out in the middle of that is an island once used to quarantine
sick sailors. Today it’s a favorite of birders who come to see some of
Grand Turk’s 190 bird species, including the flamingos, pelicans, and
herons who feed in the pond’s shallow waters.
The cruise terminal’s powder-white sand beach is just steps from the
pier, with lounge chairs, hammocks, and bartending staff coming by to
take your drink order. For $19 a day you can rent a clam shell that pro-
vides shade for two lounge chairs.
Beyond walking distance: On the island’s southwest coast, below
Cockburn Town, Governor’s Beach is one of the few blue-flagged
beaches in the Caribbean, which means it’s passed stringent tests for
water quality, cleanliness, and lifeguard availability. It also offers great
snorkeling. Right next door is Waterloo, the Governor’s mansion, a
pretty structure with the curved stucco architecture characteristic of
Bermudan buildings.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
334

Grenada
One of Heidi’s favorite Caribbean ports of call, this one-time British
Crown Colony offers a little bit of everything — history, lush jungles, and
great beaches. And it’s not overrun with tourists. Plus, maybe you didn’t
know Grenada (pronounced gre-nay-dah) produces more spices than
anywhere else in the world — including clove, cinnamon, mace, cocoa,
tonka beans, ginger, and a third of the world’s nutmeg — and thus its
nickname, the Spice Island. St. George’s, the country’s capital, is one of
the most colorful ports in the West Indies, nearly landlocked in the deep
crater of a long-dead volcano, full of charming Georgian colonial build-
ings, and flanked by old forts. The island’s coast is white and sandy; its
interior is a jungle of palms, oleander, bougainvillea, and other tropical
foliage, crisscrossed by roads and trails.
Grenada was one of the hardest hit Caribbean islands during 2004’s dev-
astating hurricane season. Almost every building sustained some level
of damage, but you can’t keep a good island down. Known for its lush-
ness and most extravagant fertility, Grenada started springing back
almost immediately, its coastal greenery growing back rapidly and its
rain forests filling out a little more slowly.
English is commonly spoken on this island, and the official currency is
the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$2.70 = US$1; EC$1 = US37¢), though
dollars are accepted commonly. Always determine which dollars — EC
or U.S. — you’re talking about when discussing a price.
Cruising into port
Ships either dock at the new multi-million-dollar pier in St. George’s
(which includes a spiffy new welcome center) or anchor in the much-
photographed harbor and send their passengers to the pier by tender.
The Carenage (St. George’s main street) is only a short walk away from
the pier.
Scoring the best excursions
Because of Grenada’s lush landscape, we recommend spending at least a
few hours touring its interior, one of the most scenic in the West Indies.
Hike to Seven Sisters Waterfalls: After a 40-minute hike along a muddy
path in the lush Grand Etang rain forest, passengers are free to take a
swim in the natural pools or hop off the edge of the cascading waterfalls.
It’s gorgeous and lots of fun. Don’t forget to wear your bathing suit and
maybe a pair of water-friendly sandals (31⁄2 hours; $64).
Island Tour, Grand Etang Lake, and Fort Frederick: This is a great way
to experience Grenada’s lush, cool, dripping-wet tropical interior. Via
bus, you travel past the red-tiled roofs of St. George’s en route to the
bright blue Grand Etang Lake, within an extinct volcanic crater some
570m (1,900 ft.) above sea level. On the way, you drive through rain
forests and stop at a spice estate. Some tours include a visit to
Annandale Falls and Fort Frederick (41⁄2 hours; $44).

Exploring on your own
Taxi fares are set by the government. A one-way taxi to Grand Anse (one
of the Caribbean’s best beaches) costs between $12 and $15 for up to
four passengers. You can also tap most taxi drivers as a guide for a day’s
sightseeing, for about $25 per hour. Water taxis also head from the
cruise ship welcome center to Grand Anse. Round-trip fare is about $6.
Within walking distance: If you’re up for a good hike and some awe-
some photo ops, walk around the historical Carenage from the cruise
terminal in St. George’s and head up to Fort George, built in 1705 by the

French and originally called Fort Royal. While the fort ruins and the 200-
to 300-year-old cannons are worth a peek, the 360-degree panoramic
views of the entire harbor area are spectacular. You can pick up a rudi-
mentary walking-tour map from the cruise terminal to help you find
interesting sites along the way.
In town, you can also visit the Grenada National Museum (Young and
Monckton streets; % 473-440-3725), set in the foundations of an old
French army barracks and prison built in 1704. Small but interesting,
check out stuff such as Joséphine Bonaparte’s bathtub from her girl-
hood in Martinique. Admission is $2.50.
Church Street, which leads right to the fort, has lots of quaint 18th- and
19th-century architecture as well as several 19th-century cathedrals and
the island’s Houses of Parliament.
Beyond walking distance: You can take a taxi up Richmond Hill to Fort
Frederick, which the French began in 1779. The British retook the island
in 1783 and completed the fort in 1791. From its battlements, you have a
panoramic view of the harbor and the yacht marina.
Don’t miss the mountains northeast of St. George’s. If you don’t have
much time, 15m (50-ft.) Annandale Falls is just a 15-minute drive away,
on the outskirts of the Grand Etang Forest Reserve. You can swim and
picnic surrounded by liana vines, elephant ears, and other tropical flora
and spices — it’s like you landed in Tahiti. If you have more time and
want a less crowded spot, Seven Sisters Waterfalls are farther into
Grand Etang, an approximately 30-minute drive and then a mile hike
through the beautiful tropical forest to the falls.
About 25 miles north of St. George’s, at the 1912 Morne Fendue
Plantation House (also known as Betty’s) at St. Patrick’s (% 473-442-
9330), you can enjoy old-time island recipes while you dine as an upper-
class family would have in the 1920s. A fixed-price lunch is served
Monday to Saturday from 12:30 to 3 p.m. Call for reservations.
Grenada’s Grand Anse Beach, with its 3.2km (2 miles) of wide sugar-
white sands, is one of the best in the Caribbean, with calm waters and a
great view of St. George’s. There are several restaurants beachside, and
you can also join a banana-boat ride or rent a Sunfish sailboat.
Jamaica
Yah mon. Jamaica is a cool, racy place as islands go, and real popular
with cruise ships, not to mention honeymooners and couples who flock
to the island’s all-inclusive resorts. The third largest of the Caribbean
islands after Cuba and Hispaniola, Jamaica has dense jungle in its inte-
rior, mountains rising as high as 2,220m (7,400 ft.), and many beautiful
white-sand beaches along its northern coast, where the cruise ships
dock. Most head for Ocho Rios, although more are opting to call at the
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 337

city of Montego Bay (“Mo Bay”), 108km (67 miles) to the west, with com-
parable attractions, excursions, and shopping possibilities.
One of the most densely populated nations in the Caribbean, with a vivid
sense of its own identity, Jamaica has a history rooted in the plantation
economy and some of the most impassioned politics in the Western
Hemisphere, all of which leads to a sometimes turbulent day-to-day real-
ity. You’ve probably heard, for example, that the island’s vendors and
hawkers can be pushy and the locals not always the most welcoming to
tourists, and while there’s definitely some truth to this, we’ve had mostly
positive experiences, so keep an open mind.
The official language is English, but most Jamaicans speak a richly
nuanced patois. The unit of currency is the Jamaican dollar, designated
by the same symbol as the U.S. dollar (US$1 = J$61; J$1 = US2¢). Visitors
can pay in U.S. dollars, but always find out if a price is being quoted in
Jamaican or U.S. dollars — though the huge difference probably makes it
obvious.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships dock at either the Port of Ocho Rios, near Dunn’s River
Falls and adjacent to Island Village and several shopping options, or at
Montego Bay, where there’s a modern cruise dock with the usual duty-
free stores and tourist information.
You can walk to the shopping, but otherwise taxis are your best means
of getting around on your own. (Definitely don’t rent a car here.) They’ll
be waiting for you at the pier. Taxis licensed by the government — and
you should only use one of these — display JTB decals, indicating they’re
official Jamaican Tourist Board taxis. Fixed rates are posted.
Scoring the best excursions
Because there’s little besides shopping near the docks at either Ocho
Rios or Montego Bay, most passengers sign up for shore excursions. The
following are usually offered from both ports.
Dunn’s River Falls Tour: Okay, they’re totally touristy, crowded, and
over-hyped, but we have to admit, climbing the falls is a blast. Cascading
180m (600 ft.) to the beach, it’s a ball to slip and slide your way up the
falls with hundreds of others, forming a human chain of sorts. Wear a
bathing suit under your clothes, and don’t forget your waterproof
camera and your aqua-socks. (If you do forget, most cruise lines rent
aqua-socks for an extra $5 or so.) The prettiest part of the falls, known
as the Laughing Waters, was used in the James Bond classics Dr. No and
Live and Let Die. Tour options often include visits to other sites and/or
shopping. Note: The falls are much closer to Ocho Rios than to Mo Bay,
so tours from the latter typically cost around $70 and require a 21⁄4-hour
drive each way, for a total of 71⁄2 hours (4–41⁄2 hours; $45).

River Tubing Safari: One of our favorite excursions, after a scenic van
ride deep into the pristine jungles, a group of 20 or so passengers and a
couple of guides sit back into big black inner tubes and glide a few miles
downriver, passing by gorgeous, towering bamboo trees and other lush
foliage. The rapids are very tame; do this for the scenery and the fun of
floating downstream on your bum! If you’re docking in Ocho Rios, this
tour is usually on the White River. If in Montego Bay, it’s on the Great
River. This trip is way better than the Martha Brae River Rafting, which
takes you down the river on two-seat bamboo rafts for about the same
price (31⁄2 hours; $58).
Horseback-Riding Excursion: After a 45-minute ride from the stables
through fields, you can gallop along the beach and take your horse bare-
back into the surf for a thrilling ride (3–31⁄2 hours; $89).
The following two popular excursions are typically offered from Mo Bay:
Rose Hall Great House: This is the most famous plantation home in
Jamaica. Built about two centuries ago by John Palmer, it gained notori-
ety from the doings of “Infamous Annie” Palmer, wife of the builder’s
grandnephew, who supposedly dabbled in witchcraft and murder. Many
Jamaicans insist the house is haunted (three hours; $43).
Greenwood Great House and Town Drive: More interesting to some
than Rose Hall, this Georgian-style building was the residence of Richard
Barrett, a first cousin of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. On display are the
family’s library, portraits, antiques, and period musical instruments 
(31⁄2 hours; $39).
Exploring on your own in Ocho Rios
The port at Ocho Rios is just a mile away from the major shopping area,
Ocean Village Shopping Centre.
Once a small banana and fishing port, Ocho Rios is now Jamaica’s cruise
ship capital, welcoming a couple of ships every day during high season.
Though the area has some of the Caribbean’s most fabled resorts, and
Dunn’s River is just a five-minute taxi ride away, the town itself — includ-
ing the outdoor markets within walking distance — is not much to see.
Don’t expect to shop in the markets without a lot of hassle and a lot of
very pushy hawking of merchandise — some of which is likely to be
ganja (the wacky weed). In recent years, a fleet of blue-uniformed “resort
patrol” on bikes has been helping keep order.
Within walking distance: Adjacent to the cruise pier, Island Village
(www.islandjamaica.com) is a 4-acre entertainment and shopping com-
plex developed by Island Records’ Chris Blackwell. Attractions include
the ReggaeXplosion museum, a museum of Jamaican art, a casino, an
outdoor concert venue and indoor theater, a beach with watersports,
and shopping (lots of it).

Beyond walking distance: Shore excursions are the best way to see
popular sights such as Dunn’s River Falls (see the preceding section
“Scoring the best excursions”).
The 1817 Brimmer Hall Estate, Port Maria, St. Mary’s (% 876-994-2309),
34km (21 miles) east of Ocho Rios, is a working plantation where you’re
driven around in a tractor-drawn jitney to see the tropical fruit trees and
coffee plants. It’s really touristy, but a lot of people seem to like it. Most
ships sell organized excursions here, or call ahead and arrange your
own. Admission is $15.
In the same general area, toward the coast, Firefly, Grants Pen, above
Oracabessa (% 876-725-0925, was the home of Sir Noël Coward and his
longtime companion, Graham Payn, who, as executor of Coward’s estate,
donated it to the Jamaica National Heritage Trust. The recently restored
house is as it was on the day Sir Noël died in 1973. Admission is $10. It’s
closed Friday through Sunday.
The cruise and hotel hordes descend upon Mallards Beach, at the
Sunset Jamaica Grande (% 876-974-2201) on Main Street. Locals may
steer you to the good and less-crowded Turtle Beach, southwest of
Mallards. You may also want to check out the big James Bond Beach
in Oracabessa, about 20 minutes from town. Bond author Ian Fleming’s
home, Goldeneye, is located nearby.
Exploring on your own in Montego Bay
Mo Bay, as it’s called by insiders, has better beaches, shopping, and
restaurants than Ocho Rios, as well as some of the best golf courses in
the Caribbean — though it also has Ocho Rios’ crime and traffic.
Within walking distance: One of the main shopping hubs is Montego
Freeport, and it’s within easy walking distance of the pier. Otherwise,
you have to take a taxi or book an organized tour to see anything.
Beyond walking distance: If you’re not taking a shore excursion, 
consider a visit to Rocklands Wildlife Station, Anchovy, St. James 
(% 876-952-2009). Lisa Salmon, known as the “Bird Lady of Anchovy,”
established this sanctuary, which is perfect for nature lovers and bird-
watchers. You can feed small doves and finches from your hand, and
with luck you can coax a Jamaican doctor bird to perch on your finger
and drink syrup. Rocklands is about 1.2km (3⁄4 mile) outside Anchovy on
the road from Montego Bay. Admission is $8.
To beach it, head for Doctor’s Cave Beach (Gloucester Avenue across
from the Doctor’s Cave Beach Hotel; % 876-952-4355; www.doctors
cave.com), which helped launch Mo Bay as a resort in the 1940s. One of
the premier beaches of Jamaica, Aquasol Theme Park (formerly Walter
Fletcher Beach), is in the heart of Mo Bay; its tranquil waters are very
family friendly. On the main road 18km (11 miles) east of Montego Bay,
the half-mile Rose Hall Beach Club (% 876-680-0969) is a secure,
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 341

secluded, white sandy beach, offering crystal-clear water, a full restau-
rant, two beach bars, and more. All of these beaches charge admission,
which runs between about $4 and $8.
If you’d rather eat than roast in the sun, beeline it to The Pork Pit (27
Gloucester Ave.; % 876-952-1046), the best place to go for the famous
Jamaican jerk pork and jerk chicken. Prices are very reasonable. Lunch
costs $10.
If golf is your bag, there are several excellent 18-hole, par-71 or -72
courses, some with ocean views. If your ship doesn’t have an excursion
there, call ahead and then get there via taxi. Courses include Tryall Club
(% 876-956-5660; www.tryallclub.com; greens fees $145), 19km (12
miles) from Montego Bay; ultrascenic Rose Hall Golf & Beach Resort,
Rose Hall (% 876-953-2650; www.rosehallresort.com; greens fees
$125), once featured in a James Bond movie; Half Moon, at Rose Hall 
(% 876-953-2560; www.halfmoon-resort.com/golf; greens fees $155);
and Ironshore Golf & Country Club, Ironshore, St. James, Montego Bay
(% 876-953-3681; greens fees $56).
Key West, Florida
If you like booz’n and browsing for tacky souvenirs, with a little history
thrown in for good measure, then cool Key West will do you just fine.
Located at the very end of the Florida Keys, Key West is America’s
southernmost city and one of its most fun-loving and goofy. It’s part
Caribbean outpost with a dash of New Orleans–style high life. There are
plenty of Hemingway look-alikes, a large gay community, and tons of
tourists shuffling around with smiles on their faces. The proximity of
most attractions to the cruise docks means there’s little sense in taking
an excursion here unless you have mobility problems. Wander around
touristy Mallory Square and Duval Street, check out some of the theme
bars, and then take a walk down some of the quieter side streets, maybe
visiting Truman’s Little White House or the Hemingway House museum.
Or spend your day playing golf, diving, or snorkeling. Several raw bars
near the dock area offer seafood, including oysters and clams, although
the king here is conch — served grilled, ground into burgers, made into
chowder, fried in batter as fritters, or served raw in a salad.
You’re in Florida, so the U.S. dollar is the official currency and English is
the language.
Cruising into port
Ships dock at Mallory Square (Old Town’s tourist central), at the nearby
Hilton Resort’s Pier B, and at the U.S. Navy base’s “Outer Mole” pier. All
are on the Gulf side of the island. Passengers arriving at the Navy pier
must take an official shuttle bus the short distance to and from Mallory
Square, as individuals are not permitted to transit the base on their own.

Scoring the best excursions
In addition to the Conch Tour Train described in the next section, most
lines offer walking tours and sometimes bike tours for those who like the
services of a guide. But, this is really a port to explore on your own, with
the exception of booze cruises.
Key West Catamaran Sail and Snorkel Tour: The popular Fury catama-
rans take passengers to a reef for some snorkeling and then finish the
trip back to shore with music, booze, and a good time (3–31⁄2 hours; $48).
Exploring on your own
Within walking distance: The flat island is only 4 miles long and 2
miles wide, so getting around is easy. The most popular attractions are
within walking distance of Mallory Square, at most a 20-minute walk. The
farthest is Hemingway House, about a mile down Duval. Many passen-
gers opt for one of the island’s tram tours, which are sold as shore

excursions but are also available on a walk-up basis. Shopping is avail-
able everywhere you look, and mostly of the flamingo snow globes, 
T-shirt, and floppy straw hats variety.
The Conch Tour Train (% 305-294-5161; www.conchtourtrain.com) is
a narrated 90-minute tour that offers commentary on 100 local sites. The
depot is located at Mallory Square, and trains depart every 30 minutes
($25 adults, $12 children 4–12, free 3 and under). The trip has only one
stop where passengers can get on and off (at the Historic Seaport). If
you want more flexibility, try the Old Town Trolley (% 305-296-6688;
www.trolleytours.com), which allows you to hop on and off its trains
to explore on your own. Prices are the same as the Conch Train, and
pickup stops are signposted around town.
If you want wheels of your own, bicycles and motor scooters are a good
bet here, and are widely available, with daily rates hovering around $14
and $30, respectively.
Depending on your degree of thirst, the most important sightseeing may
be Key West’s many bars. They’re big, are often packed, and typically
feature someone playing guitar and singing the hits in one corner. Most
serve basic chow too. Captain Tony’s Saloon (428 Greene St.; % 305-
294-1838) is the oldest active bar in Florida — Hemingway drank here
and Jimmy Buffett got his start here, what better drinking credentials
could you have? Sloppy Joe’s (201 Duval St.; % 305-294-5717) is the
most touristy bar in Key West. Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville (500
Duval St.; % 305-296-3070) is kind of a refugee from Branson, Missouri,
but if you’ve got a hankering for a cheeseburger from paradise or want
to waste away again on margaritas, this is your place. Much less com-
mercial is the open-air — and raucous and loud — Hog’s Breath Saloon
(400 Front St.; % 305-296-4222) near the cruise docks.
The Harry S. Truman Little White House (111 Front St.; % 305-294-
9911; www.trumanlittlewhitehouse.com) served as Truman’s vacation
home during his presidency and remains just as he left it, decorated in
late 1940s style. Guides lead a well-organized hour-long tour. Admission 
is $11.
Hemingway Home (907 Whitehead St.; % 305-294-1136; www.hemingway
home.com) provides a similar if less formal look back at the island’s old
days. “Papa” lived here with his second wife, Pauline, completing For
Whom the Bell Tolls and A Farewell to Arms in the studio annex out back.
Hemingway had some 60 polydactyl (many-toed) cats, whose descen-
dants still live on the grounds. Admission is $11.
Audubon House and Tropical Garden (205 Whitehead St., at Greene St.;
% 877-281-2473 or 305-294-2116; www.audubonhouse.com) is dedicated
to the 1832 Key West sojourn of the famous naturalist John James
Audubon. The main reason to visit is to see how wealthy sailors lived in
Key West in the 19th century, and the lush tropical gardens surrounding
the house. Admission is $10.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
344

The Heritage House Museum and Robert Frost Cottage (410 Caroline
St.; % 305-296-3573; www.heritagehousemuseum.org) was the home
of Jessie Porter Newton, the grande dame of Key West. Today her home
is filled with mementos of the illustrious guests who partook of her hos-
pitality, including Tennessee Williams, Gloria Swanson, and Robert Frost,
who stayed in a cottage out back.
On the waterfront at Mallory Square, the Key West Aquarium 
(1 Whitehead St.; % 305-296-2051; www.keywestaquarium.com), 
in operation since 1932, was the first tourist attraction built in the
Florida Keys. Admission is $10.
Near the docks, the Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Society Museum (200
Greene St.; % 305-294-2633; www.melfisher.com) contains some of the
more than $400 million in gold jewelry, doubloons, and other artifacts the
late treasure hunter Mel Fisher plucked from the Spanish galleon Nuestra
Señora de Atocha, which sunk off the Keys in 1622. Admission is $11.
Nancy Forrester’s Secret Garden (1 Free School Lane, off Simonton
between Southard and Fleming streets; % 305-294-0015) is the most
lavish and verdant garden in town, with some 150 species of palms and
thousands of orchids, climbing vines, and ground covers. Admission is $6.
This town is not known for beaches, but if you insist, the best of the
mediocre is Fort Zachary Taylor State Beach (% 305-292-6713), a 12-
minute walk from the docks. To get there, go through the gates leading
into the Truman Annex (site of the Little White House).
Martinique
Frenchies and Francophiles will appreciate Martinique’s history. The
island, an overseas department of France since 1946, was the birthplace
and childhood home of Empress Joséphine, sweetheart and wife of
Napoleon. Martinique is also on the map for a horrific volcano that dev-
astated St-Pierre in 1902. Within minutes, some 30,000 souls perished.
Love and death make quite a one-two punch, but they’re just the hook.
Look a bit deeper to appreciate Martinique’s subtler attractions — quaint
seaside villages, colonial ruins dating to when France and England vied
for the island, and captivatingly beautiful rain forests and beaches.
French is Martinique’s official language, but you can get by with English
at most restaurants and tourist sites. Martinique is an overseas region of
France, so the euro (€) is the official currency (1€ = US$1.20; US$1 =
.83€). U.S. dollars are commonly accepted in tourist areas.
Cruising into port
Most cruise ships dock in the heart of Fort-de-France, at the Pointe Simon
Cruise Dock, which has quays for two large vessels. Because Martinique
is a popular port of call, ships may also dock at the Passenger Terminal
at the main harbor, a nondescript cargo port on the north side of the bay,
a $10 cab ride from the center of town.

346
Scoring the best excursions
Rainforest and Plantations 4WD Safari: Take your off-road vehicle
through tropical forests and sugar-cane plantations (stopping to sample
the crop) to a banana plantation and a distillery where you do short
tours (four hours; $99).
Martinique Snorkeling: Across the bay from Fort-de-France, the reef at
Anse Dufour offers excellent snorkeling for experts and novices. The reef

is filled with marine animals, including French grunts, blackbar soldier-
fish, and silversides. Snorkeling equipment is provided, as are profes-
sional instruction, supervision, and transportation (three hours; $59).
Exploring on your own
Travel by taxi is convenient but expensive. Most cabs are metered, and
you can find them waiting at the cruise pier. To cross the bay to La Pagerie
(Empress Joséphine’s birthplace) and the resort area of Pointe du Bout,
take one of the blue ferries that sail from east of the cruise dock in Fort-
de-France at least once per hour. Round-trip tickets cost about 6€ ($7.80).
Avis, Budget, and Hertz all offer rental cars, too.
Within walking distance: A bustling town of 100,000 residents, Fort-de-
France is a sea of ochre buildings, cascading flowers, and tall palm trees.
The town’s narrow streets, cluttered with boutiques and cafes, climb
from the bowl of the sea to the surrounding hills, forming a great urban
amphitheater. There’s plenty here to keep you busy.
At the eastern end of downtown, La Savane is a broad formal park with
palms, mangoes, and manicured lawns, perfect for a promenade or rest in
the shade. Its most famous feature is the Statue of Empress Joséphine,
carved in 1858 by Vital Dubray and unceremoniously decapitated in 1995
in commemoration of her role in reinstating slavery on the island in the
early 1800s.
Across the street, Bibliothèque Schoelcher (Schoelcher Library; % 596-
70-26-67) is one of Fort-de-France’s great Belle Epoque buildings. Designed
by French architect Henri Pick and named in honor of Victor Schoelcher,
one of France’s most influential abolitionists, it houses his books and
other documents. Admission is free; closed Sunday.
Another Pick masterpiece, St. Louis Cathedral, on rue Victor Schoelcher
at rue Blénac, was built in 1895. Check out the organ, stained-glass win-
dows, and ornamented interior walls. They can be viewed every morn-
ing except Saturday.
Built in 1640, Fort St. Louis, Boulevard Alfassa, dominates the rocky
promontory east of La Savane. It first defended Fort-de-France in 1674
against Dutch invaders, and today, remains the French navy’s headquar-
ters in the Caribbean. It is open to visitors only on special occasions.
The best of Fort-de-France’s many museums, the Musée Départemental
d’Archéologie Précolombienne Préhistoire (9 rue de la Liberté; % 596-
71-57-05), traces 2,000 years of Martinique’s pre-Columbian past with
more than a thousand relics from the Arawak and Carib cultures.
Admission is US$4; closed Sunday.
You can expect to find great food all over town if you want to stop 
for lunch, and more than any other island in the French West Indies,
Martinique gives French and Creole cuisine equal billing.
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 347

Beyond walking distance: Too large to tackle in a single day, you have
to pick and choose among the island’s many museums, plantations,
floral parks, and natural wonders to visit.
Martinique’s Carib name, Madiana, means “island of flowers.” To see
what the Caribs were talking about, stroll through the Jardin de Balata
(% 596-64-48-73). Located about 8km (5 miles) north of town, this lush,
Edenic garden showcases 200 species of plants, trees, and tropical flow-
ers, as well as resident hummingbirds, frogs, and lizards. Admission is
about US$6.
One of Martinique’s must-see attractions, the village of St-Pierre on the
northwest coast, was the cultural and economic capital of the island
until 8 a.m. on May 8, 1902, when the Mount Pelée volcano exploded in
fire and lava. Three minutes later, all but one of St-Pierre’s 30,000 inhabi-
tants had been incinerated, buried in ash and lava, or asphyxiated by
poisonous gas. The town once hailed as the “Paris of the Antilles”
became “the Pompeii of the Caribbean,” and today it’s no more than a
sleepy fishing village, home to fewer than 5,000 souls. Ruins of a church,
theater, and other buildings punctuate the town, memorials to St-Pierre’s
former glory. The one-room Musée Volcanologique (rue Victor Hugo; 
% 596-78-15-16) traces the story of the cataclysm through pictures and
relics excavated from the debris. Admission is US$4.
Part sugar-plantation ruins, part tropical paradise, Habitation Céron
(% 596-52-94-53) is the most evocative of Martinique’s historical agri-
cultural sites. This sprawling 17th-century estate, 15 minutes north of 
St-Pierre, is almost as wild and tranquil as the surrounding rain forest,
but its verdigris cisterns, moss-covered stone buildings, and archaic,
still functioning water mill are all haunted with the ghosts of a time when
sugar was king. Admission is US$8.
A few miles south of St-Pierre, Le Carbet is where Columbus landed in
1502, where the first French settlers arrived in 1635, and where the
French painter Paul Gauguin lived for five months in 1887. At the site is
the tiny Musée Paul Gauguin, Anse Turin (% 596-78-22-66), though
there are no original paintings. Admission is 4€ ($5.20).
Marie Josèphe Rose Tascher de la Pagerie was born in 1763 in the 
quaint little village of Trois Ilets, across the bay from Fort-de-France. 
As Joséphine, she became the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1796 and
Empress of France in 1804. A small museum, the Musée de la Pagerie
(% 596-68-33-06), sits in the former estate kitchen building, where
Joséphine gossiped with her slaves. Admission costs about US$6.
You’ll have passed through a number of quaint coastal villages by this
time but none sweeter than Ste-Luce. Absurdly picturesque with its
blindingly white stucco walls, red-tile roofs, turquoise sea, and multi-
colored fishing boats, swim or snorkel off the small, pleasant beach, or
just chill out.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
348

Other beaches for bumming around include Grand Anse des Salines,
just south of Fort-de-France and widely regarded as Martinique’s nicest
strand. To get to the island’s main gay beach, turn right at the entrance
to Grand Anse des Salines and drive to the far end of the parking lot,
near the sign for Petite Anse des Salines. Follow the path through the
woods and then veer left till you find the quiet section with the good-
looking guys.
Conveniently located across the bay from Fort-de-France, Pointe du
Bout is Martinique’s most lavish resort area. Aside from a marina and a
variety of watersports, the area has some modest man-made, white-sand
beaches. The sandy, natural beaches at nearby Anse Mitan and Anses
d’Arlet are popular with both swimmers and snorkelers.
Beaches north of Fort-de-France have mostly gray (they like to call it
silver) volcanic sand. The best of the bunch is Anse Turin, just to the
side of the main Caribbean coastal road, between St-Pierre and Le
Carbet. Extremely popular with locals and shaded by palms, it’s where
Gauguin swam when he called the island home.
Martinique has no legal nudist beaches, but toplessness is as common
here as anywhere in France.
Puerto Rico
San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, is a bustling port that easily sees
five to ten ships a day. Many ships use San Juan as an embarkation port;
others visit as a port of call. The San Juan metropolitan area, home to
about a third of Puerto Rico’s 3.8 million people, is one of the largest and
most sophisticated urban centers in the Caribbean. The docks are right
at the foot of Old San Juan, which is popular with cruise passengers
also because it’s the most beautiful, historic part of town. The neighbor-
hood’s hilly cobblestone streets are lined with brightly painted colonial
townhouses, colonial churches, intimate parks, and sun-drenched plazas
as well as restaurants and shops (U.S. citizens don’t pay taxes here).
Like the pyramids of Egypt and the Great Wall of China, Old San Juan’s
Spanish colonial forts and city walls are United Nations World Heritage
Sites, and our top pick here.
Spanish is the native tongue, but most people on the island also speak
English (both are official languages here). The farther you venture from
San Juan, the more likely it is you’ll have to practice your Spanish.
Because Puerto Rico is part of the United States, the U.S. dollar is the
coin of the realm.
Cruising into port
Almost all cruise ships dock at Old San Juan, but during periods of
heavy volume, you may dock at one of the much less convenient cargo
piers across the water from the old town, requiring a short taxi ride.

Old San Juan
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
350

Scoring the best excursions
Unless you want a guide to offer historical perspective (21⁄2 hours; $33),
don’t bother with organized walking tours of Old San Juan — it’s easy
enough to get around on your own (pick up a walking tour map in the
terminal). On the other hand, if you explore somewhere farther afield, an
organized tour is a good idea.
El Yunque Rainforest: Though you wouldn’t know it from San Juan’s
hustle-bustle, Puerto Rico has a natural side too. After arriving at Baño
Grande, a natural swimming hole, hike half an hour along the Caimitillo
Trail and see parrot nests, giant ferns, orchids, and palms. Listen for the
song of Puerto Rico’s national symbol, the tiny coquí tree frog (four to
five hours; $35).
Rainforest Horseback Adventure: Meet your horse, briefly be shown
the ropes, and then ride along a beautiful beach. Take a quick swim
during the refreshment stop (31⁄2 hours; $89).
City Tour and Bacardi Rum Distillery: After a tour of the old city, with a
stop at Fort San Cristóbal, you travel to the Bacardi distillery to find out
about the Puerto Rican sugar and rum industries, watch giant ferment-
ing tanks transform sugar cane into rum, find out how to pronounce the
product’s name (baa-carrrr-di!), and then get a taste for yourself (four
hours; $30).
Exploring on your own
Old San Juan beckons the walker to explore its hilly streets. Taxis oper-
ated by the Tourist Transportation Division are available at the piers.
They’re metered in San Juan, but the fare structure between major
tourism zones is standardized.
Within walking distance: Walking the cobblestone streets of the his-
toric landmark area of Old San Juan, you sense five centuries of history
as you pass many of Puerto Rico’s top historical attractions. You also
find shops and cafes on any walking tour.
One must-see attraction is El Morro (Castillo de San Felipe del Morro) —
indeed, you can’t miss it as it sits at the top of a hill at the tip of the city.
Its walls are part of a network of defenses that made San Juan a walled
city, and for centuries, the fortress was considered impregnable. Here,
Spanish Puerto Rico defended itself against the navies of Great Britain,
France, and Holland, as well as against hundreds of pirate ships. The
National Park Service maintains both El Morro and Fort San Cristóbal,
located less than a mile east along the north coast.
Other varied and interesting sites include La Fortaleza and Mansion
Ejecutiva, the centuries-old residence of the Puerto Rican governor; Plaza
de Armas, the most beautiful of the squares in Old Town, flanked by the
neoclassic Intendencia, which houses offices of the State Department and
San Juan’s historic City Hall; La Casa Blanca, which the son-in-law of Juan
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 351

Ponce de León built as the great explorer’s island home (although he
never lived there); and La Princesa, once the most-feared prison in the
Caribbean. The Puerto Rican Academy of Fine Arts is at the Antiguo
Monicomio Insular (originally built in 1854 as an insane asylum). The
nearby Asilo de Beneficencia, or “Home for the Poor,” is a stately neo-
classical building dating to the 1840s.
In the Plaza de San José, the statue of explorer Juan Ponce de León 
was cast from an English cannon captured during a naval battle in 1797.
Dominicans established the Iglesia de San José, the church for which
the plaza is named, in 1523. Several other historic buildings surround
the plaza, including the Museo de Pablo Casals, which honors the
Spanish-born cellist who lived his final years in Puerto Rico, and a
former 17th-century convent, El Convento, which has been converted
into one of the few hotels within the Old City. The Catedral de San Juan,
Puerto Rico’s most famous church, is across the street. You can also
visit Capilla de Cristo, a tiny chapel with a silver altar dedicated to the
Christ of Miracles. Also not far from the plaza, the Cuartel de Ballajá
houses the Museum of the Americas on its second floor.
Beyond walking distance: Perhaps the most famous beach in the
Caribbean, Condado Beach, at the western end of Ashford Avenue, is
the backyard playground of Condado’s resort hotels. A favorite of fami-
lies, it can get pretty crowded in winter. The beaches of Isla Verde,
behind the hotels and condominiums along Isla Verde Avenue, are less
rocky and are excellent for people-watching. Both have white sand, palm
trees, watersports, and plenty of eating and drinking options.
If you’re more of a gambler than a sunbather, casinos are one of San
Juan’s biggest draws, and most large hotels have one. They’re generally
open daily from noon to 4 a.m., but some never close. There’s the plush
Casino at the Ritz-Carlton (6961 State Rd., Isla Verde; % 800-241-3333
or 787-253-1700); the elegant Inter-Continental San Juan (187 Isla Verde
Ave.; % 800-303-1758 or 787-791-6100); and, the most convenient for
cruise ship passengers, the Sheraton Old San Juan Hotel & Casino (100
Brumbaugh St.; % 800-325-3535 or 787-721-5100), is directly across from
Pier 3 and often bustling.
Golf is also an option, just be sure to sign up for a ship excursion or plan
on renting a car to get to the courses, which include the well-regarded
Hyatt Dorado Beach Resort & Country Club (% 787-796-8961; www.
hyatt.com), The Doral Resort at Palmas del Mar (% 787-285-2256;
www.palmascountryclub.com), and The Westin Rio Mar Golf Resort &
Spa (% 787-888-6000; www.westinriomar.com). Greens fees at each
range from $130 to $190.
St. Barthélemy (St. Barts)
Chic, sophisticated St. Barts (or, technically, St. Barthélemy, a name no
one ever uses) is internationally renowned as one of the ritziest refuges

St. Barthélemy (St. Barts)
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 353
in the Caribbean, rivaled only by Mustique as the preferred island retreat
of the rich and famous. Yet despite all the hoopla, St. Barts retains its
charm, serenity, natural beauty, and incredibly French flavor — in con-
trast to most Caribbean islands, where descendants of African slaves
form the majority, St. Barts’s 7,000 year-round residents are primarily of
French ancestry. Gustavia, the main port (whose name harks back to the
19th century, when Sweden controlled the island), is full of French restau-
rants and semi-chic, semi-boho nightspots. Many of the small luxe ships
that call here stay into the evening so that passengers can get a night out.
Away from town, the island is full of dramatic hills and pristine white-
sand beaches.
French is the official language, but virtually everyone speaks English as
well. St. Barts is part of the French overseas region of Guadeloupe, so
the euro (€) is the official currency (1€ = US$1.20; $1 = .83€). U.S. dol-
lars are commonly accepted.

Cruising into port
Cruise ships anchor off Gustavia, the main town, and ferry passengers
to the dollhouse-size harbor and town via tenders.
Scoring the best excursions
Jet-Set Boat and Beach Excursion: Circumnavigate St. Barts in a 40-foot
cruiser, then tender ashore at St. Jean Beach for a swim, snorkel, and/or
drinks from the open bar (four hours; $200–$400)
St. Barts on Horseback: Travel to northern St. Barts for a relaxed guided
ride through the island’s outback (two hours; $55).
Exploring on your own
Taxis congregate at Gustavia’s harbor to take cruise passengers to the
beaches. If you want some adventure, rent a Smart Car, the latest toys
on the island — they come in all kinds of bright colors — for a ride up
and down St. Barts’s picturesque, hilly roads. Budget, Avis, Hertz, and
National have offices here.
Within walking distance: For a taste of the island’s celeb vibe, make 
a beeline to Le Select (rue de la France at rue du Général de Gaulle; 
% 590-27-86-87), the epicenter of Gustavia’s social life for more than 
50 years. This cafe’s tables rest in a tree-shaded garden a block from 
the harbor. The classic, funky ambience inspired Jimmy Buffett’s
“Cheeseburger in Paradise,” and a mix of salty locals, celebrities, and
chic tourists typically make up the clientele. Aside from hanging out,
shopping, and eating, cruisers sticking close to port can also visit
Gustavia’s modest points of interest: St. Bartholomew’s Church, rue
Samuel Fahlberg, dates from the 1850s, and the Municipal Museum, on
rue Duquesne, across from the dock (% 590-29-71-55), is an unfocused
but respectable introduction to the island. Admission is US$2; closed
Saturday afternoon and Monday morning.
Beyond walking distance: For a little culture, the tiny fishing village of
Corossol is a step back in time. About 10 minutes by taxi from the dock,
this quaint, totally un-chic hamlet is home to traditional folk who still
live off the sea. On the town’s waterfront, just to the left of the road from
Gustavia, the Inter Oceans Museum (% 590-27-62-97) catalogs thou-
sands of shells, corals, sand dollars, sea horses, sea urchins, and fish
from around the world, all displayed in endearingly homemade style.
Admission is 3€ ($3.90); closed Mondays.
The most famous of the island’s 22 beaches is St-Jean, where you can
enjoy watersports, beach restaurants, and a few hotels. Grand Cul de
Sac offers a similar active vibe. If you want peace and privacy, the best
secluded beaches include Marigot and Colombier to the north, and
Grande Saline and Gouverneur to the south (which is very remote).
Topless sunbathing is quite common (and at Saline, you may also see a
lot of people in the altogether, even though nudity is officially forbidden).

354

St. Kitts
St. Kitts is almost ridiculously lush and fertile, dotted with rain forests
and waterfalls and boasting some lovely beaches along its southeast
coastline, but it’s also extremely poor, still dependent on the same
sugar-cane crop that brought its English plantation owners riches (and
its slaves hot misery) back in colonial days. Cane fields climb the slopes
of its volcanic mountain range, and you can see ruins of old mills and
plantation houses as you drive around the island. Basseterre, the capital
city, is full of old-time colonial architecture, but it’s a small-scale place
with little to offer visitors beyond a pleasant walk-around. The island’s
most impressive landmark, Brimstone Hill Fortress, is about 15km 
(9 miles) west of town. St. Kitts forms the larger and more populated half
of the combined Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, two islands separated
by only about 3.2km (2 miles) of ocean.
English is the language of both islands. The local currency is the Eastern
Caribbean dollar (US$1 = EC$2.70; EC$1 = US37¢). Many shops and
restaurants quote prices in U.S. dollars. Always determine which cur-
rency locals are talking about.
Cruising into port
Port Zante stretches from the center of town into the deep waters off-
shore, with shopping, restaurants, and a welcome center on-site. New
additions to the facility, including a second pier and expanded shopping,
were due to be completed soon after this book hit the shelves.
Scoring the best excursions
Brimstone Hill Fortress and Romney Gardens: Among the largest and
best-preserved forts in the Caribbean, Brimstone Hill Fortress National
Park (www.brimstonehillfortress.org) dates from 1690, when the
British fortified the hill to help recapture Fort Charles from the French.
In 1782, an invading force of 8,000 French troops bombarded the fortress
for a month before its small British garrison, supplemented by local mili-
tia, surrendered. When the British took the island back the next year,
they proceeded to enlarge the fort into “The Gibraltar of the West
Indies.” In all, the structure took 104 years to complete. Today it’s the
centerpiece of a national park crisscrossed by nature trails, with a popu-
lation of green vervet monkeys to keep things lively. Tours typically
include a visit to the beautiful Romney Gardens, located amidst the
ruins of a sugar estate between Basseterre and the fort. You can check
out the lush hillside gardens, featuring giant ferns, orchids, poinsettias,
and “The Tree,” a 350-year-old Saman tree (three hours; $46).
Mountain Biking and Beach Tour: From the pier, you ride through
Basseterre then out through sugar-cane fields and up 450m (1,500-ft.)
Olivees Mountain for views and refreshments. After the ride down, you
stop at Friar’s Bay for a swim and snack. It’s a nice way to see this lush
island (four hours; $78).

Rainforest and Gardens Hiking Safari: Departing from Romney Gardens,
you hike along a loop of trails through lush rain forest. With luck, you can
catch sight of some of the island’s resident monkeys (four hours; $59).
Exploring on your own
You can walk around Basseterre, but you need a taxi to get anywhere
else. They greet cruise passengers (loudly) at the docks and also around
the Circus, a public square near the docks at the intersection of Bank and
Fort streets. Taxis aren’t metered, so agree on the price before hopping

in. Always ask if the rates quoted are in U.S. dollars or Eastern Caribbean
dollars.
Within walking distance: The capital city of Basseterre, where your ship
will dock, has typical British colonial architecture and some quaint build-
ings, a few shops, and a market where locals display fruits and flowers —
but even this description may give you the wrong idea about this place.
There’s no getting around that Basseterre is a very poor town, with few
attractions aimed at visitors. When we were last there, chickens were 
wandering around in front of the government buildings. St. George’s
Anglican Church, on Cayon Street (walk straight up Church Street or Fort
Street from the dock), is the oldest church in town and is worth a look.
Independence Square, a stone’s throw from the docks along Bank Street,
is pretty, with its central fountain and old church, but there’s no good
reason to linger unless it’s to sit in the shade and toss back a bottle of
Ting, the local grapefruit-based soda.
For beaches, head to the narrow peninsula in the southeast to find the
bands of sand and swimming. There’s Conaree Beach, 4.8km (3 miles)
from Basseterre; Frigate Bay, with its talcum-powder-fine sand; the twin
beaches of Banana Bay and Cockleshell Bay, at the southeast corner of
the island; and Friar’s Bay, a peninsula beach opening onto both the
Atlantic and the Caribbean.
Beyond walking distance: All the best stuff to do outside of town is
covered in the preceding section “Scoring the best excursions.”
To experience the sweeter side of St. Kitts, try a stalk of sugar cane. Buy
one from any farmer, peel it, and chew the inner reeds to enjoy the sweet
juice. Try it with ice and a splash of rum.
St. Lucia
Of all the islands in the Caribbean, St. Lucia is most likely to make you
think you’re in the South Pacific, with its green mountains, the peaks of
Petit Piton and Gros Piton, and the brilliant white sandy beaches along
the northwest coast. Castries, the capital, has grown up around an
extinct volcanic crater that’s now a large harbor surrounded by hills. It
looks more modern than other regional capitals because fires destroyed
many of the original French colonial and Victorian buildings typical of
the region’s architecture. But at its heart, Castries is still very tradi-
tional. The country women dress in traditional cotton headdresses to
sell their luscious fruits and vegetables, while weather-beaten men sit
close by playing warrie (a fast game played with pebbles on a carved
board) or fleet games of dominoes using tiles the color of cherries.
English is the official language. The official currency is the Eastern
Caribbean dollar (US$1 = EC$2.70; EC$1 = US37¢), though shops and
restaurants commonly take the U.S. dollar as well. Be sure you know
which currency a price is being quoted in before paying.
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 357

Cruising into port
Most cruise ships arrive at a fairly new pier at Pointe Seraphine, within
walking distance of the center of Castries and boasting St. Lucia’s best
shopping. In the unlikely event that Pointe Seraphine is full, your ship
may dock instead at Port Castries on the other side of the colorful
harbor. There’s a shopping terminal here called La Place Carenage. Some
smaller lines, such as Star Clippers, Seabourn, and Clipper, visit other
sites around the island, anchoring off Rodney Bay to the north or
Soufrière to the south and carrying passengers ashore by tender.
Scoring the best excursions
Pigeon Island Sea Kayaking: After transferring to Rodney Bay, you make
the approximately 30-minute paddle out to the island, where you have
time to swim, kayak some more, or make the steep climb up to Fort
Rodney (three hours; $65–$70).
Rainforest Bicycle Tour: Pedal past banana plantations and the Errard
Falls waterfall, and stop to sample various fruits that grow along the
roadside (41⁄2 hours; $69). A different tour, Jungle Mountain Biking, takes
you by boat to the Jungle Biking facility, located on an 18th-century sugar
plantation. There, you can explore 16km (10 miles) of trails at your own
pace (41⁄2 hours; $104).
Soody Nature Hike and Mineral Waterfall: Drive along the west coast
through fishing villages and banana plantations, before arriving at
Soufrière, location of the Pitons and the Diamond Botanical Gardens,
Waterfall, and Mineral Baths. A guided hour-long hike through the vol-
canic forest introduces you to the island’s flora and fauna, and ends up
at a therapeutic sulphuric waterfall where you can take a dip to cure
what ails ya. Lunch at a Creole restaurant is included (seven hours; $55).
Exploring on your own
There is an official taxi association servicing both Pointe Seraphine and
La Place Carenage, with standard fares posted. You can hire a taxi to go
to Soufrière on your own, too. Many taxi drivers offer two- to three-hour
tours, with a stop at the beach, for US$120 for up to four people. Be sure
you’re talking U.S. or EC dollars before agreeing on a price.
Within walking distance: The principal streets of Castries are William
Peter Boulevard and Bridge Street. Don’t miss a walk through town:
People are very friendly, and Jeremie Street is chockablock with variety
stores of the most authentic local kind, selling everything from spices to
housewares. A Roman Catholic cathedral stands on Columbus Square,
and take a gander at the enormous 400-year-old “rain” tree, also called a
“no-name” tree, which grows in the square.
Beyond Government House lies Morne Fortune, which means “Hill of
Good Luck.” Actually, no one’s had much luck here, certainly not the
French and British soldiers who battled for Fort Charlotte. The fort

switched between the two sides many times. You can visit the 18th-
century barracks, complete with a military cemetery, a small museum,
the Old Powder Magazine, and the “Four Apostles Battery,” four grim
muzzle-loading cannons. The view of the harbor of Castries is panoramic
from this point. To reach Morne Fortune, head east on Bridge Street.
Also worth a visit in Castries is a colorful market near the dock.
Beyond walking distance: St. Lucia’s first national park, the 44-acre
Pigeon Island National Landmark (% 758-450-0603), is ideal for picnics
and nature walks, and is covered with lemongrass. It’s joined to the main-
land by a causeway, so you can take a taxi there. Stop by the Captain’s
Cellar pub, with seating out on the lawn just beyond the spray from the
Atlantic waves. Two white-sand beaches lie on the island’s west coast.
Island admission is $5.
La Soufrière, a fishing port and St. Lucia’s second largest settlement, is
dominated by the Pitons. Near the town is the famous “drive-in” vol-
cano, La Soufrière, a rocky lunar landscape of bubbling mud and craters
seething with fuming sulfur. You can literally drive into an old crater and
walk between the sulfur springs and pools of hissing steam. Nearby are
the Diamond Mineral Baths, dating back to 1784.
Leading beaches along the calm shores of the western coast include
Pigeon Island, off the northern shore; Vigie Beach, north of Castries
Harbour; Marigot Beach, south of Castries Harbour; and Reduit Beach,
between Choc Bay and Pigeon Point. Just north of Soufrière is a beach
connoisseur’s delight, Anse Chastanet (% 758-459-7000), boasting an
expanse of white sand at the foothills of lush, green mountains. This is a
fantastic spot for snorkeling.
Sint Maarten & St. Martin
This 96-sq.-km (37-sq.-mile) island has two faces. It’s been shared by
France and the Netherlands for more than 350 years. Although the
border between the two sides is virtually imperceptible — a monument
along the road marks the change in administration — each side retains
elements of its own heritage. The French side (St. Martin), with some of
the best beaches and restaurants in the Caribbean, emphasizes quiet
elegance. The Dutch side (Sint Maarten) reflects Holland’s anything-goes
philosophy: Development is much more widespread, flashy casinos
pepper the landscape, and strip malls make the larger towns look as
much like Anaheim as Amsterdam. The 100 percent duty-free shopping
has turned both sides of the island into a bargain-hunter’s paradise.
In case you were wondering, the official language on the Dutch side is
Dutch, and the official language on the French side is French. Most
people on both sides also speak English. The legal tender in Dutch Sint
Maarten is the Netherlands Antilles guilder, or NAf (NAf1.83 = US$1;
NAf1 = US55¢), and the official currency on the French side is the euro
(1€ = US$1.20; $1 = .83€). U.S. dollars are widely accepted on both sides,
and most prices are quoted in U.S. dollars, too.

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 361
Cruising into port
All cruise ships dock on the Dutch side, at A. C. Wathey Pier, about
1.6km (1 mile) southeast of Philipsburg. The majority of passengers are
then tendered to the smaller Captain Hodge Pier in Great Bay Harbour at
the center of town, but others choose to walk the distance on a newly
developed boardwalk or take a taxi. The new $40 million Harbor Point
Village waterside complex at the port offers a host of shopping and
entertainment venues housed in old West Indies–style architecture.
Smaller vessels sometimes dock on the French side of the island, at
Marina Port la Royale, adjacent to the heart of Marigot.

Scoring the best excursions
America’s Cup Regatta: A hands-on sailing adventure aboard one of the
yachts that competes in the America’s Cup races (three hours; $89).
Pinel Island Snorkeling Tour: Offered on the French side, take a scenic
bus ride to the French side and catch a boat to this small offshore islet
for some of St. Martin’s best snorkeling (31⁄2 hours; $39).
Exploring on your own in Sint Maarten
Taxis on both sides of the island are unmetered. Agree on a rate and cur-
rency before getting in. Dutch law requires that drivers list government-
regulated fares based on two passengers. Privately owned and operated
minivans have signs to indicate their destination, and can be hailed any-
where on the street. Fares are usually about $1.50. Rental cars are a
great way to see both sides of the island. Avis, Budget, and Hertz all
have offices here.
Within walking distance: Smack dab in front of the Philipsburg town
pier, on Wathey Square, the 1793-built Courthouse combines northern
European sobriety with Caribbean brightness. East of the Courthouse, at 
7 Front St. (down a little shopping alley), is the tiny Sint Maarten Museum
(% 599-542-4917). Admission is free; closes 2 p.m. Saturday and all day
Sunday. Historically, Fort Amsterdam is the Dutch side’s most important
colonial site. Since 1631, the fort has looked out over Great Bay from the
hill west of Philipsburg. The fort was the Netherlands’ first military out-
post in the Caribbean. The Spanish captured it two years later, making it
their most significant bastion east of Puerto Rico. The site provides grand
views of the bay, but ruins of the walls and a couple of rusty cannons are
all that remain of the original fort.
From the center of town, you can walk right up to Great Bay Beach; this
mile-long stretch is convenient and has calm water, but it lacks the tran-
quility of the more remote beaches.
Gambling is also big here, with several casinos clustered along Front
Street in the heart of Philipsburg. All of them open early enough to snag
cruisers.
Beyond walking distance: Just west of the airport, on the west side of
the island, Maho Beach boasts a casino, shade palms, and a popular
beachside bar and grill. It’s a good snorkeling spot, too. Farther west,
Mullet Beach borders the island’s golf course. Shaded by palm trees and
crowded on weekends, it’s popular with swimmers and snorkelers.
Dawn Beach, on the east coast, is the best snorkeling site on the island.
Rent equipment from Busby’s Beach Bar, which is right on the sand.
Exploring on your own in St. Martin
For taxi info, see the preceding section, “Exploring on your own in Sint
Maarten.”
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
362

Within walking distance: From the 1767-built Fort St. Louis, Marigot’s
answer to Fort Amsterdam, the short climb up top affords splendid vistas.
As a respite from the sun, duck into Marigot’s Museum of Saint Martin
(% 590-29-22-84), next to the tourism office and adjacent to the marina.
Much more thorough and scholarly than its Philipsburg counterpart, this
institution boasts a first-rate collection of Ciboney, Arawak, and Carib arti-
facts excavated from the island’s Amerindian sites. Admission costs US$5;
closed Sunday. For shoppers, an open-air market is in the center of town.
Another busy center of activity is Port La Royale, the largest shopping
arcade on the French side.
Petit Club is the oldest restaurant in Marigot, serving Creole and French
specialties such as spicy conch stew and fresh fish.
Beyond walking distance: Top-rated beaches on the French side are
Baie Longue (Long Bay) and Friars Beach, just outside of Marigot. If you
want a stripped-down adventure, visit the famous clothes-optional Orient
Beach. South of Orient Beach, the waveless waters of Coconut Grove or
Galion Beach are shallow up to 30m (100 ft.) offshore. Protected by a
coral reef, this area is No. 1 with kids and popular with windsurfers.
St. Thomas and St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands
Ever since Columbus discovered the Virgin Islands during his second
voyage to the New World in 1493, they have proven irresistible to foreign
powers seeking territory, at one time or another being governed by
Denmark, Spain, France, England, Holland, and, since 1917, by the United
States. Tourism and U.S. government programs have raised the standard
of living to one of the highest in the Caribbean, and today the island is
one of the busiest and most developed cruise ports in the Caribbean. On
St. Thomas, Charlotte Amalie (pronounced ah-mahl-yah), named in 1691
in honor of the wife of Denmark’s King Christian V, is the island’s capital
and has become the Caribbean’s major shopping center and one of its
busiest cruise ports — it’s often downright jampacked (and not one of
our favorite ports).
The most tranquil and unspoiled of the U.S. Virgin Islands is St. John, the
smallest of the lot, more than half of which is preserved as the gorgeous
Virgin Islands National Park. A rocky coastline, forming crescent-shaped
bays and white-sand beaches, rings the whole island, whose miles of ser-
pentine hiking trails lead past the ruins of 18th-century Danish planta-
tions and onto panoramic ocean views.
English is spoken on both islands, and the U.S. dollar is the currency.
Americans get a break on shopping in the U.S. Virgin Islands, as they can
bring home $1,600 worth of merchandise without paying duty, as opposed
to $400 from most other Caribbean ports. You can also bring back more
liquor from here. See Chapter 19 for more Customs information.
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 363

Cruising into port
Most cruise ships anchor at West Indian Dock/Havensight Mall. Located
at the eastern end of Charlotte Amalie Harbor, 21⁄2 miles from the town
center, it’s got its own restaurants, bookstores, banks, postal van, and lots
of duty-free shops. Many people make the long, hot walk to the center of
Charlotte Amalie, but it’s not a scenic route in any way, so you may want
to opt for one of the $4 per-person open-air taxis. If Havensight is clogged
with cruise ships, your ship will dock at the Crown Bay Marina, to the
west of Charlotte Amalie. A taxi is your best bet — the 30-minute-plus
walk into Charlotte Amalie feels longer on a hot day, and isn’t terribly pic-
turesque. A taxi ride into town from here costs about $4. Keep in mind,
traffic jams are common here.
Cruise ships cannot dock at either of St. John’s piers. Instead, they moor
off the coast at Cruz Bay, sending tenders to the National Park Service
Dock, the larger of the piers. Most cruise ships docking at St. Thomas
offer shore excursions to St. John’s pristine interior and beaches; it’s
just a 45-minute ferry ride between Charlotte Amalie and Cruz Bay.
Seeking out the best shore excursions
Expect to snooze through the St. Thomas sightseeing trips that most
ships offer. Here are a few better bets:
Coral World and Island Drive: Coral World Underwater Observatory
and Marine Park is St. Thomas’s top attraction (three hours; $39–$42).
Kayaking the Marine Sanctuary: Kayak from the mouth of the marine
sanctuary at Holmberg’s Marina and spend nearly an hour paddling
among the mangroves while a naturalist explains the mangrove and
lagoon ecosystem. Includes a free half-hour to snorkel or walk along the
coral beach at Bovoni Point (31⁄2 hours; $72).
Golfing at Mahogany Run: Designed by Tom and George Fazio,
Mahogany Run is one of the most beautiful courses in the West Indies.
This 18-hole, par-70 course rises and drops like a roller coaster on its
journey to the sea. You can also make arrangements for play on your
own (% 800-253-7103, ext. 1, or 340-777-6250, ext. 1). Greens fees are
$130, including cart; the 20- to 30-minute taxi ride costs you about $10
each way (five hours; $170).
St. John Eco-Hike: Take the ferry to St. John for a walkabout through the
Virgin Islands National Park. The Lind Point Trail ascends about 250 feet
to the Lind Point Overlook for views of St. John, St. Thomas, and the sur-
rounding islands. An expert guide discusses the park’s ecosystem and
St. John’s cultural history while you walk to Honeymoon Beach for a
little swimming (four hours; $64).
Water Island Bike Trip and Beach Adventure: After a ferry ride to
Water Island, a five-minute bus ride takes you to the island’s highest

point, from which you get a nice downhill ride. Your guide will point 
out various historic sites and wildlife en route to Honeymoon Beach 
(31⁄2 hours; $79).
Exploring on your own in St. Thomas
Taxis are the chief means of transport here. They’re unmetered, but a
guide of point-to-point fares around the island is included in most tourist
magazines. Less formal, privately owned taxi vans make unscheduled
stops along major traffic arteries, charging less than a dollar for most
rides.
Within walking distance: In days of yore, seafarers from all over the
globe flocked to the old Danish town of Charlotte Amalie, including
pirates and, during the Civil War, Confederate sailors. The main streets
(called Gades here in honor of their Danish heritage) are a veritable
shopping mall, especially close to the waterfront. Stray farther landward
and you can find pockets of 19th-century houses and the truly charming,
cozy, brick-and-stone St. Thomas Synagogue, built in 1833 by Sephardic
Jews. There’s a great view from here as well. It’s located high on steep,
sloping Crystal Gade.
Dating from 1672, Fort Christian, 32 Raadets Gade, rises from the harbor
to dominate the center of town. Named after the Danish king Christian V,
the structure has been everything from a governor’s residence to a jail.
Many pirates were hanged in its courtyard.
Seven Arches Museum, on Government Hill (% 340-774-9295), is a two-
century-old Danish house completely restored to its original condition
and furnished with antiques. You can walk through the yellow ballast
arches and visit the great room with its view of the busy harbor.
Admission is $5.
The Paradise Point Tramway (% 340-774-9809) affords visitors a dra-
matic view of Charlotte Amalie Harbor at a peak height of 697 feet. The
tramways transport customers from the Havensight area to Paradise
Point, where riders disembark to visit shops and a popular restaurant
and bar. The cost is $18 round-trip.
Shopping is a main attraction in St. Thomas, and Main Street is the main
shopping street. To the north is the fully stocked Back Street. The
Waterfront Highway also sports stores, and you can always check out
the side streets, alleys, and walkways between these principal streets.
Dating back to 1672 and dominating the center of town, Fort Christian
was named after the Danish monarch Christian V and has served as
everything from a governor’s residence to a prison. Some of the cells
have become part of the American-Caribbean Historical Museum.
Historical artifacts are on display at the small facility.

Gardens, at the corner of St. Peter Mountain Road (Rte. 40) and Barrett

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 367

Hill Road (% 340-774-4999), ornaments 11 acres on the volcanic peaks
of the island’s northern rim. It’s the creation of Howard Lawson DeWolfe,
a Mayflower descendant who, with his wife, Sylvie, bought the estate in
1987 and set about transforming it into a tropical paradise. It’s filled with
some 200 varieties of plants and trees, including an umbrella plant from
Madagascar. There’s also a rain forest, an orchid jungle, waterfalls, and
reflecting ponds. From a panoramic deck you can see some 20 of the
Virgin Islands. The house itself is worth a visit, its interior filled with
local art. Admission is $10.
St. Thomas has some good beaches, all of which are easily reached by
taxi. Arrange for your driver to return and pick you up at a designated
time. If you’re going to St. John, you may want to do your beaching there.
St. Thomas’s beaches are open to the public, but some charge a fee. The
most well known (and most popular for windsurfing) is Sapphire Beach
on the east end of the island. Rent snorkeling gear or lounge chairs, or
stretch out on its white-coral sand and take in the sun and the spectacu-
lar views of the bay. Other worthwhile beaches are Magens Bay, Coki
Beach (at the Marine Park), and the Morningstar, just 2 miles from port.
If you check out the beaches on St. Thomas, be sure to protect your
belongings — pickpockets and thieves have been known to strike. Also,
to ensure that you don’t miss the boat, arrange for a cab to pick you up
at a specific time.
Exploring on your own in St. John
A tiny gem, lush St. John lies about 3 miles east of St. Thomas across
Pillsbury Sound. It’s the smallest and least populated of the U.S. Virgins,
and since 1956, more than half of St. John’s land mass, as well as its shore-
line waters, have been set aside as the Virgin Islands National Park, and
today the island leads the Caribbean in eco- (or “sustainable”) tourism.
Miles of winding hiking trails lead to panoramic views and the ruins of
18th-century Danish plantations. Because St. John is easy to reach from 
St. Thomas, and the beaches are spectacular, many cruise ship passen-
gers spend their entire stay there.
Within walking distance: You can find shopping, bars, and restaurants
right by the docks. Otherwise, the most popular way to get around 
St. John is by surrey-style taxi. Typical fares from Cruz Bay are $5.50 
to Trunk Bay, $7 to Cinnamon Bay, and $11 to Maho Bay. Taxis wait at
the pier. You can also rent open-sided jeeps. Avis and Hertz both have
offices here. Just remember to drive on the left, even though steering
wheels are on the left, too. Go figure.
Beyond walking distance: At the Virgin Islands National Park, head to
the visitor center (% 340-776-6201) right on the dock at St. Cruz, where
you can view some exhibits and find out more about what you can see
and do in the park. You can explore the park on the more than 20 miles
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
368

of biking trails; rent your own car, Jeep, or Mini-Moke; or hike. The start-
ing points of some trails are within walking distance while others can 
be reached by taxi for about $5 to $20. Within the park, try to see the
Annaberg Ruins, Leinster Bay Road, where the Danes founded thriving
plantations and a sugar mill in 1718. They’re located off North Shore
Road, east of Trunk Bay on the north shore.
To beach it, Trunk Bay is your best bet for the local beach experience,
especially for snorkelers, who can rent gear and explore the underwater
trail near the shore. Trunk Bay has amenities, such as showers, a snack
shop, and lifeguards, but it also has crowds. Hawksnest Beach,
Cinnamon Bay, Honeymoon Beach, Maho Bay, and Salt Pond Bay are
all good beach choices.
Enjoying the Cruise Lines’ Private Islands
Several cruise lines have spent millions to create their own fantasy
islands (or at least beaches), giving passengers a beach day without the
hassle of having to find the place. You normally get a whole day to bake
on the beach, swim, snorkel, play beach games, go water-skiing or para-
sailing, or take advantage of whatever fancy facilities the cruise line has
built. Children’s activities may involve playground facilities, beach
walks, and games. The islands typically have several beaches (the far-
thest off usually being the quietest), several bars, live music, and at least
a few places to get lunch, usually of the barbecue variety.
Among the islands, only Disney’s has docking facilities allowing passen-
gers to just walk out onto the island. At all the others, you must ride a
tender back and forth from the ship. Make sure to alert the crew if you
require special assistance or a little “tender” loving care.
 Costa Cruises: Passengers on Costa’s eastern Caribbean itineraries
spend a day at Catalina Island, off the coast of the Dominican
Republic, enjoying a long beach fringed by palm trees; opportuni-
ties for volleyball, beach Olympics, and snorkeling (plus jet skiing
and banana-boat rides for a fee); and massages on the beach. Music
and barbecue round out the day, and there’s also a strip of shops
hawking jewelry, beachwear, and other souvenirs.
 Disney Cruise Line: The 1,000-acre, 3×2-mile Castaway Cay (pro-
nounced key) is a port of call on all Disney cruises, and is definitely
the most elaborate of the private islands. Guests can swim and
snorkel, rent bikes and boats, get their hair braided, shop, send
postcards, go parasailing, have a massage, take a nature hike, or
just lounge in a hammock or on the beach, snarfing barbecue.
Families can head to their own beach, lined with lounge chairs and
pastel-colored umbrellas, where they can swim, explore a 12-acre
snorkeling course, climb around on the offshore water-play struc-
tures, or rent a kayak, paddle boat, banana boat, sailboat, or other
beach equipment. Teens have a beach of their own, as do adults
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 369

(on the far end of the island), and kids 3 to 12 can play at a super-
vised children’s activity center whose highlight is an excavation
site where kids can dig till they find something, then make plaster
molds of whatever it might be.
 Holland America: Located on the Bahamian island of San Salvador,
Half Moon Cay is a port of call on most of the line’s Caribbean and
Panama Canal cruises. Though the island is large, spreading out over
2,500 acres, Holland America has developed only 45 acres of it, main-
taining the rest as a wild-bird reserve on behalf of the Bahamian
National Trust. You can explore a network of hiking trails while keep-
ing an eye out for all sorts of birds. Families can appreciate the water
park at one end of the beach, as well as the offshore play areas.
Massages are available in huts along the beach, and big-spenders
can also get air-conditioned beachfront cabanas with an open bar
and butler service. La di da. Away from the main beach area, you 
can spend extra to go horseback riding, swim around with resident
stingrays, or go windsurfing, snorkeling, kayaking, scuba diving,
deep-sea fishing, parasailing, sailboarding, or aqua-cycling.
 MSC Cruises: Most of MSC’s Caribbean cruises spend a day in Cayo
Levantado, a beach-rimmed, palm-tree-lined rainforest island off the
northeast coast of the Dominican Republic’s Samana Peninsula. As at
all the other private islands, passengers may choose to flop out on
the beautiful white-sand beach, take a tour (including jeep safaris
and a whalewatching cruise to see the humpbacks that winter in
these waters), or go snorkeling or swimming. There are beach chairs,
umbrellas, walking paths, and tables for an open-air lunch. Unlike the
other private islands in this section, Cayo Levantado actually isn’t
private at all: It’s run by a Dominican company with whom MSC has
scheduled port calls. The line also makes calls at the Dominican
Republic port of La Romana, where passengers can enjoy the 7,000
acre resort Casa de Campo.
 Norwegian Cruise Line: Norwegian bought the small, uninhabited
Bahamian island of Great Stirrup Cay in 1977, making it the oldest
(and the least impressive too, actually) of the private cruise line
islands. Passengers can ride paddle boats, sail Sunfish, go snorkel-
ing or parasailing, hop on a banana boat, join a game of volleyball,
get a massage at one of the beachside stations, or do nothing more
than sunbathe all day long. For kids, organized activities include
volleyball tournaments and sandcastle building.
 Princess Cruises: Princess set up Princess Cays in 1992 on the
southwest coast of Eleuthera in the Bahamas, and today makes it a
stop on most eastern and western Caribbean itineraries. The half-
mile of shoreline gives passengers room to swim, snorkel, and
make use of Princess’s fleet of Hobie Cats, Sunfish, banana boats,
kayaks, and paddle-wheelers (bookable aboard ship before your
visit). There’s also live music, a dance area, and a beach barbecue,
plus a strip of several dozen tree-shaded hammocks at the far end

of the beach. For kids, there’s a supervised play area with a sand-
box and a pirate ship–themed playground.
 Royal Caribbean (and Celebrity): Sister lines Royal Caribbean and
Celebrity have two different private spots, which often figure into
their itineraries. CocoCay (also known as Little Stirrup Cay) is a
small, 140-acre dot in the Bahamas’ Berry Islands. You can find lots
of beach, hammocks, food, drink, and watersports, plus such activi-
ties as limbo contests, water-balloon tosses, relay races, and volley-
ball tournaments. Kids get an aqua park that includes a floating
trampoline, water slides, and a sunken airplane and schooner 
for snorkelers. For something quieter there’s Wanderer’s Beach,
with calm surf and ultrasoft sand. The line’s other beach stop is
Labadee, an isolated, very private 270-acre peninsula along Haiti’s
north coast. Five beaches are spread around the peninsula, and are
progressively less crowded the farther you walk from the dock. In
the Columbus Cove area, a children’s aqua park called Arawak Cay
is full of floating trampolines, inflatable iceberg-shaped slides, and
water seesaws. Kayaking and parasailing are offered from a dock
nearby. A big plus at Labadee is the authentic and high-quality
music and dance. On both Labadee and CocoCay, organized chil-
dren’s activities include beach parties, volleyball, seashell collect-
ing, and sand-castle building.

hy visit Alaska? Conjure up some postcard images: towering
mountains, mountainous glaciers, sky-blue icebergs, leaping
whales, lumbering moose, rain-forested fjords, endless tundra, bears and
bald eagles, ravens as big as pug dogs, ice fields as big as cities, lumber-
jacks as big as . . . lumberjacks.
Sail the Caribbean and your megaship may completely dwarf the islands
it visits, and be visible from miles away. Sail Alaska and that same mega-
ship looks like a matchstick, completely overawed by the mountains, the
expansive sky, and wilderness that seems to go on forever.
Visit the towns and meet people who embody the frontier spirit that
brought them or their ancestors here — as well as thousands of sea-
sonal workers who come to serve all you cruise passengers. Add
Alaska’s rich Native culture, its Russian colonial history, its gold rush
mythology, and its “North to the Future” attitude, and you have one of
the world’s great cruise destinations.
Boarding Ship for Alaska
Most Alaska cruises concentrate on the Southeast Alaska panhandle, a
string of islands linked by the waterway known as the Inside Passage.
Some stay entirely within this region, sailing round-trip from Vancouver,
British Columbia, or Seattle, Washington. Others sail north- or south-
bound cruises between one of those ports and the northern towns of
Seward or Whittier, the ports nearest to Alaska’s biggest city, Anchorage.
In addition to the Inside Passage, those cruises also sail through the
Gulf of Alaska and sometimes Prince William Sound.

Lines like Regent, Silversea, Celebrity, and Princess offer some Alaska
cruises that sail round-trip from San Francisco. Most of the small-ship
lines sail from one of the port towns in southeast Alaska (primarily
Juneau, but also Ketchikan and Sitka), though some also operate out of
Anchorage and Seattle.
If possible, plan to arrive at least a day or two before your sailing date,
especially if you have to travel a long distance. You can use that extra
day to recover from jet lag and explore whichever port you’re sailing
from, all of which have much to recommend them.
Storming the Shore
All the port towns along the Inside Passage have downtown areas com-
pact enough to tour by foot if you choose — though as in almost every
place that relies heavily on the tourist industry, they have their share of
Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 373
Cruise ships in Alaska: Angel or devil?
The 49th state is one of the top cruise destinations in the world, with about 750,000
people cruising there annually. That may not sound like much in the abstract — after
all, Alaska’s a huge state, right? — but two facts make it actually a pretty big figure:
(1) Even though Alaska has more coastline than the rest of the United States com-
bined, cruise ships sail in only about 20 percent of that area (and only really concen-
trate on about 10 percent); and (2) the cruise season is incredibly short, only lasting
from late May to mid-September. That leads to crowding in the biggest ports of call,
and also to some backlash, with local critics decrying excessive pedestrian traffic on
their city streets, heavy bus traffic on outlying roads, and environmental damage to
the air and seas.
Some towns, particularly Juneau, Ketchikan, and Skagway, really can get over-
whelmed by cruise passengers at the height of high season, with a potential for more
than 6,000 people floating in daily. The delicate balancing act between the resulting
congestion and the plain fact that tourism provides the state’s second largest pool of
jobs has led to debate in recent years over imposing head taxes on cruise passen-
gers, with the proceeds going to infrastructure support, conservation efforts, and other
initiatives. At press time, just such an initiative was set to go before voters in November
2006. The initiative calls for a $50-per-passenger head tax, plus additional taxes on
gambling and heightened environmental monitoring requirements.
Elsewhere on the environmental front, several well-publicized cases of illegal dump-
ing over the past decade have led the cruise industry to institute in-house and indus-
try-wide compliance and monitoring — after all, they can’t sell cruises to pristine
Alaska if they’re perceived as making it less pristine. State and local governments also
have a hand in minimizing cruise ships’ impact in some of Alaska’s most famous wild
places. Glacier Bay, for example, has a strict permit system that allows in only two
large cruise ships and several smaller vessels on any given day.

kitsch. In the most-visited cruise ports, expect a lot of tourist shops
owned by out-of-state merchants, staffed by seasonal workers, and
stocked with “Alaskan” merchandise that’s actually made in China or
Indonesia. Yuck, we say. Yuck. Luckily, no matter how crowded and
touristy the area around the docks, all ports also offer ways of seeing
some of the real Alaska, either on your own or via shore excursions.
In addition to the standard walking tours, bus tours, and even a few
horse-drawn carriage tours, cruise lines also offer a slew of active,
adventurous, and sometimes educational excursions. You can choose
among mountain-biking, hiking, and kayaking trips; salmon fishing expe-
ditions; helicopter and floatplane flightseeing; rafting trips through
wildlife refuges; dogsled trips and workshops; visits to Alaska Native
towns and tribal houses; brewery tours (now that’s educational!); and
many other options.
At the adventurous (and expensive) extreme of excursion offerings,
flightseeing trips show the vast and varied Alaskan landscape from the
air. Tour operators offer these trips via small planes and helicopters, and
sometimes pair them with unforgettable options such as landing on a
glacier for a trek across the ice — one of the top experiences we’ve ever
had on a cruise.
Shore excursion prices we list in this chapter are for 2006 and may
increase slightly in 2007.
If you’re touring on your own, you need a taxi or shuttle to get to the more
outlying attractions — for example, Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau or
Saxman Totem Pole Park in Ketchikan. We provide information in each
port write-up on which attractions you can walk to and which require
wheels. You probably need to avail yourself of transportation in the large
embarkation ports (such as Anchorage, Seattle, and Vancouver), though
each has a walkable downtown core.
Watching Whales
Whales are a huge draw on Alaska cruises, ranking right up there with
calving glaciers and Alaska Amber beer. On most large cruise ships, the
captain or officer on watch makes an announcement after he spots a
whale, at which point half the people on board crane their necks in the
same direction.
To be honest with you, whale-watching takes patience because, frankly,
whales spend a lot of time underwater. What the spotter is seeing is typi-
cally the curve of the whale’s back as he slides through the water, or the
flash of his tail as he makes a deep sounding dive. It can be minutes
before he comes up again, and you never know exactly where that may
happen.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
376

Humpbacks are definitely the stars of the Alaska whale-watching show,
easily recognized by their huge, mottled tails; by the hump on their
back, just forward of its dorsal fin; and by their armlike flippers, which
can grow to be 14 feet long. These migratory whales spend all their sum-
mers in Alaska, feeding on small fish and other tiny creatures that they
filter through strips of stiff, fibrous baleen — the material that hump-
backs have instead of teeth. Most humpback sightings are of the whales’
humped backs as they cruise along the surface, resting, and of the flukes
of the tail as they dive. Feeding dives can last a long time and often mean
you won’t see that particular whale again, but if you’re lucky, the whale
may be just dipping down for a few minutes before breaching — leaping
straight out of the water, twisting around in midair before falling back
with a gigantic kersploosh! No one knows for sure why they do this,
though to look at them it seems obvious: They’re enjoying themselves.
Orcas, or “killer whales,” are probably the next most frequently
sighted. Easily identified by their stark black-and-white patches, they’re
the ocean’s top predator, moving like wolves in highly structured family
groups called pods and swimming at up to 25 knots (about 29 mph) in
pursuit of salmon, porpoises, seals, sea lions, and almost anything else
that moves — except man, oddly enough. Like dolphins, orcas often pop
above the surface in a flashing, graceful arc when they travel, giving
viewers a glance at their sleek shape, markings, and tall dorsal fin. On a
recent trip, we spotted a pod of Orcas coming straight toward our ship.
As passengers watched, the group — at least ten strong, the younger
whales flanked by their parents — turned and sliced through the water
no more than 20 feet off the ship’s port side, the sun shining off their
sleek, angular dorsal fins and panda-colored backs. It was “a moment.”
You may also spot Beluga whales and Minke whales. Belugas are the
small, white whales with the cute rounded beaks. More likely to be con-
fused for a dolphin than any other whale, belugas are larger and fatter
than a dolphin and lack the dolphin’s dorsal fin. Adults are all white,
while juveniles are gray, and they swim in large packs that can number
in the dozens, feeding on salmon. Minkes are the smallest of the baleen
whales, generally under 26 feet long, with a blackish-gray body, a white
stomach, a narrow, triangular head, and white bands on its flippers.
When breaching, minkes leap something like dolphins, gracefully reen-
tering the water headfirst — unlike humpbacks, which smash down on
their sides. Also unlike the humpbacks, they don’t raise their flukes
clear of the water when they dive.
Choosing a Cruisetour
If you have additional time and dough, consider booking a cruisetour
package that combines a cruise with a land tour via bus, train, and
sometimes boat and plane. That’s the only way you get to see some of
the Alaskan Interior, which is vastly different from the rain forest ecosys-
tem of Southeast Alaska. Holland America, Princess, Royal Caribbean,
Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 377

and Celebrity Cruises are the bigwigs in the cruisetour market, each
with their own transportation infrastructure. Holland America and
Princess also own their own hotels and lodges.
Cruise lines typically offer a number of different cruisetour options, con-
centrating on different regions.
A typical Anchorage/Denali/Fairbanks cruisetour package may include
a 7-night Vancouver–Anchorage cruise, followed by 2 nights in Anchorage
and a private railcar ride to Denali National Park for a full day in the
park and a 2-night stay at one of the cruise line’s lodges. If you’re lucky,
the cloud gods will part to give you a look at Mount McKinley, North
America’s highest peak at 20,320 feet. From there, you go by train to
Fairbanks, spending two more days on activities that may include day
cruises on the Chena and Tanana Rivers, jet boat rides, and excursions 
to gold mines and dredges. Passengers typically fly home from Fairbanks.
A shorter variation of that itinerary may skip Fairbanks and return to
Anchorage for departure.
Other cruisetours hop the border into Canada’s huge Yukon Territory,
combining a 3- or 4-day cruise between Vancouver and Juneau/Skagway
with a land program into the Klondike. Passengers travel by rail, river-
boat, motor coach, and sometimes air, with overnight stops in the terri-
torial capital of Whitehorse and the picturesque Gold Rush town of
Dawson City. From there it’s back to Fairbanks, then through Denali to
Anchorage and home. The tour can be taken in either direction.
Other cruisetour options include an add-on to Wrangell–St. Elias
National Park, east of Anchorage, or the Kenai Peninsula, south of
Anchorage. A Canadian Rockies cruisetour offers some of the finest
mountain scenery on earth, visiting Canada’s Banff National Park, Jasper
National Park, and other national and provincial parks. The beautiful
Lake Louise, colored deep green from its mineral content, is located 35
miles north of Banff.
The cost of a cruisetour typically includes hotel stays, transportation
(usually train and/or bus and sometimes a plane or ferry), and a limited
number of meals (usually only while in transit).
The Ports of Embarkation
You have to start somewhere, and for an Alaska cruise that somewhere
will probably be either Vancouver, Seattle, or Seward/Whittier (which
serve as ports for Anchorage). Some small ships also sail itineraries that
begin and/or end in Juneau and Ketchikan.
Anchorage
No, Anchorage isn’t the capital of Alaska, though a lot of people think it
should be. It’s the state’s largest city and one of the newest big cities in

the U.S., only really taking off as a population center after World War II.
The city was badly beaten up by the great quake and resulting tsunami
of 1964, which rivaled in strength the one that hit South Asia in 2004,
though with far less loss of life. Today it’s a modern city with good
restaurants, good museums, a nice little zoo, and several major attrac-
tions right outside town.
Cruising into port
Though Anchorage is the official northern embarkation and debarkation
port on Gulf of Alaska cruises, it actually isn’t. It’s located on the wrong
side of the Kenai Peninsula from the usual cruise ship routes, so ships
typically dock instead in the towns of Seward or Whittier, both located
on the southeast side. The switcheroo saves a whole day of sailing, let-
ting the ships concentrate more of their sea time on the Inside Passage,
then transport passengers overland to Anchorage (two to three hours
from Seward by bus) or bypass Anchorage completely and head straight
for Denali National Park by rail (Princess Cruises only, from Whittier).
Neither Seward nor Whittier offers much to hold visitor interest, and
most people tend to head right from bus to ship, or the other way
around. Cruise lines also offer several shore excursions from each port:
sportfishing in Seward, for example, or sea kayaking near Whittier in
Prince William Sound. Other excursions tour Anchorage before dropping
passengers off at the international airport.

If you have time in Seward, visit the Alaska SeaLife Center, on the water-
front at Mile 0 of the Seward Highway (% 800-224-2525; www.alaska
sealife.org). A major research aquarium founded with Exxon restitu-
tions following the infamous Exxon Valdez oil spill, the center allows 
scientists and visitors (the latter through windows) to study sea lions,
porpoises, sea otters, harbor seals, fish, and other forms of marine life
that abound in the area, as well as many species of local seabirds.
Admission is $15 adults, $12 ages 7 to 12, free 6 and under.
Whittier’s only real attraction is that it’s Anchorage’s closest gateway to
the wilderness splendor of Prince William Sound. Born as an army town,
Whittier retains its barracks-like ambience, with almost every resident
(and the grocery store, and the medical center) living in the 14-story
Begich Towers. You heard that right: Almost everyone in town lives in
that one building. An underground walkway links it with the local school
so that the kids don’t have to plough through the 14 feet of snow
Whittier endures every winter.
Exploring on your own
Anchorage’s downtown area is a manageable 8-by-20 blocks, with some
areas catering strictly to tourists and others obviously for locals only. The
Visitor Bureau’s Log Cabin Visitor Information Center is at 4th Avenue
and F Street (% 907-274-3531; www.anchorage.net). Across the intersec-
tion, in the old post office, the Alaska Public Lands Information Center
(605 W. 4th Ave., Suite 105; % 907-271-2737; www.nps.gov/aplic) can
help anyone planning to spend time outdoors anywhere in Alaska.
Within walking distance: If you visit town on a weekday from June to
August, you can join one of the historic tours hosted by Alaska Historic
Properties (% 907-274-3600). Meet in the lobby of the old City Hall (524
W. 4th Ave.; next to the Log Cabin Visitor Information Center) at 1 p.m.
The one-hour tours cover about 2 miles and cost $5.
You can view contemporary Alaskan art and a large collection covering
Alaskan history and anthropology in the galleries of the Anchorage
Museum of History and Art (121 W. 7th Ave., between A and C streets;
% 907-343-4326; www.anchoragemuseum.org).
If you want a dose of the outdoors, stretch your legs along the paved, 
11-mile Tony Knowles Coastal Trail, which runs through downtown and
along the waters of Knik Arm for about 12 miles, from the western end of
Second Avenue to Kincaid Park. You can hop on the trail at several points,
including Elderberry Park at the western end of 5th Avenue. You can also
rent a bike from Downtown Bicycle Rental (333 W. 4th Ave.; % 907-279-
5293; www.alaska-bike-rentals.com) for $16 for the first three hours
and $4 for each hour thereafter, up to a total of $29 for a 24-hour rental.
Most of the shopping is very kitschy, but you can find a few goodies in the
mix. The Cook Inlet Book Company (415 W. 5th Ave.; % 907-258-4544;
www.cookinlet.com) has a huge and in-depth stock of Alaska-oriented
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why

books. The Oomingmak Musk Ox Producers’ Co-operative (604 H St. at
6th Ave.; % 888-360-9665; www.qiviut.com) is a co-op owned by Alaska
Native women in villages across the state. All of their products are knitted
from qiviut (kiv-ee-oot), the light, warm, silky — and rare — underhair of
the musk ox.
Beyond walking distance: The Alaska Native Heritage Center (8800
Heritage Center Dr.; % 800-315-6608; www.alaskanative.net) is
located about 15 minutes from downtown Anchorage and provides a
great introduction to the lives and cultures of the state’s five major
Native groups: Southeast Alaska’s Tlingit, Eyak, Haida, and Tsimshian
tribes; the Athabascans of the Interior; the Inupiat and St. Lawrence
Island Yupik Natives of the far north; the Aleuts and Alutiiqs of the
Aleutian Islands; and the Yup’ik and Cup’ik tribes of the extreme west.
The center features reconstructions of traditional Native dwellings,
Native interpreters to explain what life was like in traditional communi-
ties; a small museum displaying some remarkable carvings and masks; a
workshop for Native craftspeople; a theater presenting a rotating series
of films on Native culture; and a rotunda for storytelling, dance, and
music performances. Admission is $21. A free shuttle leaves regularly
from the Anchorage Museum, the Anchorage Visitors Center at 4th
Avenue and F Street, and several other sites. Times are posted at all
pickup points, or call % 907-330-8000.
If you’re traveling with kids, Anchorage offers a few kid-centric options,
including the H2Oasis Water Park (1520 O’Malley Rd.; % 888-H2OASIS;
www.h2oasiswaterpark.com), which offers a wave pool that generates
3-to-4-foot waves, a 150-foot long enclosed body slide, a children’s lagoon,
a pirate’s ship, water cannons, and other fun. A day pass for an adult (13
and older) costs $22; children under 13 pay $17. About 8 miles south of
downtown, the Alaska Zoo (4731 O’Malley Rd.; % 907-346-3242; www.
alaskazoo.org) affords you a closer look at many Alaskan animal
species and some non-native varieties. Admission is $9 adults, $5 kids.
If you want to head out of town and into the wild, the Alaska Public
Lands Information Center can show you a good route to the easily
accessible and scenic Chugach Mountains. Or you can take a drive
along Turnagain Arm, which stretches roughly 50 miles south of
Anchorage to the funky little town of Girdwood. The road provides
breathtaking mountain views and the possibility of wildlife sightings,
including moose, Dall sheep, and occasionally beluga whales, all right
from your car window. You can rent a car in Anchorage (see the appen-
dix for toll-free numbers of rental firms) or take one of the seven- or ten-
hour tours offered by Gray Line of Alaska (% 800-544-2206; www.gray
linealaska.com), which include Turnagain Arm and a boat ride to
Portage Glacier.
Vancouver, British Columbia
About half the cruise ships that explore the Inside Passage and Gulf of
Alaska use Vancouver as the main southern embarkation and debarkation
Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 381

port. Originally scouted out by the Spanish (uh, after Canada’s First
Nations people had already been there about 12,000 years, we mean),
Vancouver was named for Captain George Vancouver, who led a British
expedition to the region in 1792, beginning the era of British control. Fur
traders really got things rolling here in the early and mid-19th century,
with more people arriving during the gold fever of the 1850s and 60s, but
it wasn’t until the Canadian Pacific Railway set up a terminus here in 1884
that the city really began to boom. Today it’s a lovely, friendly city sur-
rounded by mountains and ocean, with a rich vein of Northwest Coast
Native culture, a thriving Asian community, a great arts scene, and a bla-
tantly friendly populace.
The Canadian dollar (C$1.11 = US$1; C$1 = US90¢) is Canada’s official
currency. We quote all prices in this section in U.S. dollars.
Cruising into port
Most cruise ships dock at Canada Place (www.canadaplace.ca) at the
end of Burrard Street. The pier terminal is a landmark in the city, noted
for its five-sail structure, which reaches into the harbor like a ship set-
ting off. It’s located at the edge of the downtown district and is just a
quick stroll from the Gastown area (see the following section “Exploring
on your own”) and other area attractions. Some ships may dock at the
Ballantyne cruise terminal, about five minutes away by taxi.
Scoring the best excursions
Coastal Rainforest Adventure: This bus tour acquaints you with
Vancouver’s downtown area before continuing out to Capilano Canyon,
where you go on a 2-mile walk through the rain forest. A naturalist guide
provides insight as you go (31⁄2 hours; $73).
Capilano Suspension Bridge and Grouse Mountain Skyride: Afraid 
of heights? Don’t go on this tour, which visits the historic Capilano
Suspension Bridge, a walkway that sways 230 feet above the canyon
below. From here, you take the Grouse Mountain Skyride to the 4,000-
foot summit, where you can hike one of the nature trails or grab lunch
(five hours; $89).
Exploring on your own
The Tourism Vancouver Infocentre is near the piers, as are hotels,
restaurants, and shops.
Within walking distance: So close to the ship pier that you can’t miss
it, Gastown is a charming area of historic buildings, cobblestone streets,
and gaslights (although the area’s name actually comes from a 19th-
century saloon-owner, “Gassy” Jack Deighton). Tourists enjoy the
bohemian atmosphere, complete with street musicians, antiques and
art shops, boutiques, cafes, and clubs.

Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 383

Besides featuring delicious Asian cuisine and shops selling Chinese
goods, Vancouver’s Chinatown is also a historic district, and one of 
the largest Chinese neighborhoods in North America. The area’s most
famous attraction is the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Garden (578 Carrall St.; % 604-
689-7133; www.vancouverchinesegarden.com), a perfectly traditional
Chinese garden based on the yin-yang principle. Admission is $7.90.
Check out Robson Street and the Pacific Centre Mall for trendy fash-
ions and bargains.
Cruise passengers may be particularly interested in visiting an exhibit of
a 19th-century immigrant ship’s steerage deck at the Vancouver Museum
(1100 Chestnut St.; % 604-736-4431; www.vanmuseum.bc.ca), which
covers the history of the city from prehistoric times to the present.
Admission is $9.
Downtown, not far inland from the cruise docks, Robson Street is full 
of boutiques, souvenir shops, coffeehouses, and bistros. About 15 min-
utes’ walk from downtown across False Creek, Granville Island (www.
granvilleisland.com) is a former industrial site whose warehouses
and factories now house galleries, artist studios, restaurants, theaters,
and lots of shopping.
Beyond walking distance: Just a few miles from downtown Vancouver,
northwest of the cruise ship terminal, the 1,000 acres of Stanley Park
contain gorgeous rose gardens, hiking trails, totem poles, a kids’ water
park, and the Vancouver Aquarium (% 604-659-FISH; www.vanaqua.
org), one of the largest in North America. Admission to the aquarium 
is $17.
Seattle, Washington
A longtime embarkation port for small ships, Seattle is now home base for
many of the big Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Princess, Norwegian Cruise
Line, and Holland America ships headed Alaska-ways. It is very much a
water-oriented city, set between Puget Sound and Lake Washington (with
Lake Union in the center) and boasts a beautiful setting, fine restaurants
and attractions, culture, and shopping. To top it all off, it’s easy to get to,
with excellent air connections to everywhere.
Similar to Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco, the Seattle waterfront is
both touristy and home to some great restaurants and shops, as well as
the popular Seattle Aquarium. It runs along Alaskan Way from Yesler
Way North to Bay Street and Myrtle Edwards Park.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships dock at Pier 66 (the Bell St. Terminal), right in downtown
Seattle, or at the Pier 30 terminal, 2431 East Marginal Way S., at the south
end of Seattle’s downtown waterfront, just a few minutes away by car or
taxi.

Scoring the best excursions
Seattle Duck Tour: Explore Seattle in a WWII-era amphibious tour bus,
which explores the Seattle waterfront, historic Pioneer Square, Safeco
Field, Pike Place Market, and the downtown shopping district before
driving right into Lake Union (three hours; $45).
Bus Tour: A standard bus tour that includes the Space Needle and shop-
ping time at Pike Place Market (three hours; $45).
Exploring on your own
The Visitors Bureau’s Citywide Concierge Center is located at the
Washington State Convention and Trade Center, on Pike Street between
7th and 8th Avenues, on the Galleria level.
Within walking distance: A National Historic District, Pike Place
Market (between Pike and Pine streets at First Avenue; % 206-682-7453;
www.pikeplacemarket.org) provides a venue for some 200 local arti-
sans and fine artists to display and sell their wares, and for countless
street performers, restaurants, and literally hundreds of shops. Two
blocks from the market, the Seattle Art Museum (100 University St; 
% 206-654-3100; www.seattleartmuseum.org) has a great collection
that includes African masks, Old Masters, Andy Warhol, and one of the
nation’s premier collections of Northwest Coast Indian art. It’s closed

until spring 2007, but by summer should be reopened with vastly
expanded facilities.
If the huge octopus at the Seattle Aquarium (1483 Alaskan Way, in
Waterfront Park; % 206-386-4320; www.seattleaquarium.org) doesn’t
pull you in, its exhibits about Puget Sound sea life will. Admission is $13
adults, $8.50 kids 6 to 12, $5.50 kids 3 to 5.
Built for the 1962 World’s Fair, the 600-foot Space Needle (400 Broad St.;
% 206-443-2111; www.spaceneedle.com) has become a symbol of
Seattle, pointing to the architectural trends of some Jetsonian future that
may or may not arrive. You can enjoy fantastic views from the observa-
tion deck or dine in either of two equally expensive restaurants inside.
Admission is $14 adults, $7 kids. Next door, the newish, bizarro-looking
Experience Music Project (% 877-367-5483; www.emplive.com) is a
combination museum, performance center, and school, with displays,
interactive music rooms, performance spaces, and galleries dedicated to
all aspects of American popular music. Admission is $20 adults, $15 kids
7 to 17, free 6 and under.
Beyond walking distance: Across Puget Sound in Blake Island State
Marine Park is Tillicum Village, another surprising legacy of the 1962
World’s Fair. You arrive by boat to this incredibly scenic spot where
totem poles guard a traditional Northwest Coast Indian longhouse sur-
rounded by forest (which is pretty much the whole “village,” despite the
name). Inside the longhouse is a large restaurant and performance hall
where you can watch traditional masked dances while you enjoy an
alder-smoked salmon dinner. Tillicum Village Tours (Pier 56; % 206-
933-8600; www.tillicumvillage.com) operates visits that include
round-trip boat transportation to the village, an elegant dinner, and
dance performance. The cost is $69 adults, $25 kids 5 to 12.
The Ports of Call
Generally, a ship visits three or four ports of call during a 7-night Alaska
itinerary, plus the ports of embarkation and debarkation and several
outstanding natural areas. The ports and areas in this section are the
most popular.
Haines
Surrounded by snowcapped mountains, Haines is the quintessential
quiet, small Alaska town, the kind of place where you wouldn’t be sur-
prised to see a moose wandering down Main Street. It was established in
1879 not as a gold rush town like Skagway (its neighbor 15 miles up the
Lynn Canal) but as a missionary town. The U.S. military arrived in the
early 20th century and built Fort William Seward, a very unmilitary-
looking military base, which was deactivated after World War II and is
now a local tourist attraction, with a replica of a Tlingit clan house on its
9-acre parade grounds. The surrounding buildings, once barracks and

officers’ quarters, have been converted to private homes, B&Bs, and
arts-and-performance spaces.
Downtown Haines has an almost totally local character, with an assort-
ment of shops and museums mixed in — the main reason why only a few
large ships dock here (plus a number of small ships). But that’s just what
makes Haines appealing: It’s not just a tourist town.
Cruising into port
Ships tie up to the Port Chilkoot Dock, directly opposite Fort William
Seward and 1⁄2 mile from downtown. Visitor information is available at the
dock. Most ships provide shuttle service to Main Street, or you can walk
down Front Street to Main.
Scoring the best excursions
Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve Float Trip: Haines is one of the best places
on earth to see bald eagles, and the Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve, about

20 miles outside town, is probably the best place to see them near
Haines. An expert guide rows your rubber raft and provides commen-
tary on the area’s natural environment, keeping an eye out for eagles,
moose, bears, and wolves (four hours; $99).
Chilkoot Lake Bicycle Adventure: After driving to your start point, you
can ride 8 miles along the shore of Lutak Inlet, where the river meets the
sea. Highlights include some amazing views of the lake, glaciers, water-
falls, and mountains, and a chance at spotting eagles and bears (three
hours; $87).
Taste of Haines Tour: Visit the Haines Brewing Company, the smallest
brewery in Alaska, for a sample and a talk with the brewmaster. Then
head to a local smoked-salmon shop to sample and find out how that
stuff is prepared (two hours; $55).
Offbeat Haines: Where else but Haines can you take a tour that includes
the world’s one and only hammer museum (see the following section
“Exploring on your own”), a visit to an artists’ studio out in Mud Bay,
and a stop at a set created for the Disney film White Fang. Includes a 
10-mile drive along the Chilkat River (two hours; $30).
Best of Haines by Classic Car: Explore Haines in a 1930s- or 1940s-
vintage car while your driver shares the history of the area and gives
you a peek into how the townsfolk live after the tourists have gone home
(one hour; $54).
Exploring on your own
Within walking distance: Just above the dock, at Fort William Seward,
the Alaska Indian Arts Cultural Center (% 907-766-2160; www.alaska
indianarts.com) has a small gallery selling traditional artwork and
prints, plus a carvers’ workshop where you may see totem-carving in
progress. Between the fort and the town center, the American Bald
Eagle Foundation and Natural History Museum (Haines Highway at 2nd
Avenue; % 907-766-3094; www.baldeagles.org) has a huge diorama
with more than 180 stuffed eagles and other critters. Admission is $3.
Main Street has two museums. The Sheldon Museum and Cultural
Center, near the small-boat harbor (% 907-766-2366; www.sheldon
museum.org), has been around since 1925, displaying a collection of
local items and Tlingit art begun by local shopkeepers Steve and Bess
Sheldon. Admission is $3. A more recent addition to the local scene is
Dave and Carol Pohl’s Hammer Museum (108 Main St.; % 907-766-2374;
www.hammermuseum.org), which is exactly what it sounds like, display-
ing more than 1,200 different hammers from around the globe. Admission
is $3.
Beyond walking distance: Not much except the Chilkat Bald Eagle
Preserve, and that’s best visited on a shore excursion (see the preced-
ing “Scoring the best excursions” section).
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why

Juneau
Juneau, Alaska’s state capital and third-largest city (after Anchorage and
Fairbanks), is surrounded by ice fields on three sides and water on the
fourth, which makes it the only U.S. state capital that you can’t drive to.
Another weird fact: Although Juneau’s downtown area looks relatively
small, the greater city encompasses 3,108 square miles, making it simul-
taneously the largest state capital in terms of mass and probably the
only one that includes ice fields within its city limits. In spite of all this,
Juneau is actually a fairly cosmopolitan city (by Alaskan standards, cer-
tainly) and one of the most-visited ports for cruise ships, with four or
five ships making port here virtually every day during the summer
season. If you’re sailing an Inside Passage itinerary, you’ll almost cer-
tainly stop here.
Juneau had its foundations in gold mining, beginning when Chief Kowee
of the Auk Tlingit clan led miners Joe Juneau and Richard Harris to a
local strike. As soon as you disembark ship, look up along the Mount
Roberts Tramway to spot the ruins of the Alaska-Juneau Mill on the
mountainside. Known locally as the A-J, it produced a whopping 3.5 mil-
lion ounces of gold before it closed in 1944, effectively closing the book
on Juneau’s mining economy.
In town, right beyond the end of the dock, you find shops, saloons,
restaurants, a great museum, and some nice historical architecture,
including the State Capitol Building. Various forest hiking trails, the
blue-white Mendenhall Glacier, and several other attractions are
located a short drive out of town.
Cruising into port
Both large and small ships dock right in the downtown area, along
Marine Way. Every once in a while, overcrowding may mean a ship has
to anchor in the channel and tender its passengers to the dock.
Scoring the best excursions
Glacier Helicopter Tour: Glaciers are impressive when seen from the
water, but you ain’t seen nothing till you get up above, into the moun-
tains, and see just how unbelievably massive they really are. This heli-
copter tour lands you right on either the Norris or the Mendenhall
Glacier, where you have time to get out and walk around on the surface.
This is one of the best shore excursions we’ve ever taken, anywhere
(21⁄2–61⁄2 hours; $240–$395).
Mendenhall Glacier Float Trip: An experienced rafter steers your ten-
person raft across Mendenhall Lake and past icebergs until you get to
the Mendenhall River and its beautiful scenery. You encounter moder-
ate rapids and stunning views, and get a snack of smoked salmon and
reindeer sausage somewhere along the way (four hours; $112).

Juneau
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
390
Mendenhall Glacier and City Highlights Tour: Travel by bus from
downtown Juneau to the glacier and its U.S. Forest Service Observatory.
There, as time allows, you can follow one of the nature trails or hike to
within a half-mile of the glacier — which sounds far, but the ice face is 
so enormous you’d think you’re within spitting distance. A visit to the
University of Alaska campus and the Gastineau Salmon Hatchery round
out your tour (three hours; $40). Other tours pair the glacier and hatch-
ery with an outdoor salmon bake, with music and the possibility of beer,
though you have to pay extra for the latter (four hours; $67).
Bike and Brew Tour: Speaking of beer, this 11-mile bicycle tour takes
you from town along Fritz Cove Road, offers views of picturesque Auke
Bay and the Mendenhall Glacier, then ends at the Alaska Brewing
Company for a tour and sampling of the brew (41⁄2 hours; $89).
Wilderness Lodge Flightseeing Adventure: This tour combines flightsee-
ing over an ice field and glaciers with a salmon bake at the Taku Glacier
Lodge, and enough time for a short nature trail hike (31⁄2 hours; $257).

Exploring on your own
You can find walking maps and visitors’ guides at the visitor informa-
tion center, located right on the dock, in a green building near the base
of the Mount Roberts Tram. Downtown begins right at the end of the
docks, but there’s also a shuttle that circuits the town throughout the
day. The Davis Log Cabin Visitor Center is located farther up in town,
on Seward Street (% 907-586-2201). It’s a replica of the city’s first
schoolhouse.
Within walking distance: Right on the docks, you can hop on board the
Mount Roberts Tramway (490 S. Franklin St.; % 888-461-TRAM; www.
goldbelttours.com) for a six-minute ride 1,760 feet straight up Mount
Roberts. At the top is an observation area, a restaurant, shops, and a
series of nature trails through the alpine ecosystem, offering great views
of the Gastineau Channel below. If the sky is overcast, you won’t get the
views, though the trails can still be great — as long as you bring bug
repellent. Tickets are $24 adults, $13 children 12 and under, and allow
unlimited rides.
The Red Dog Saloon (278 S. Franklin St.; % 907-463-3658; www.reddog
saloon.cc) sits right at the intersection just beyond the docks and is a
virtual magnet for cruise passengers. Its self-created legend is that it’s a
wild frontier bar, but actually it’s pretty Disney — still fun, though, with a
sawdust-covered floor, live music, and walls full of memorabilia. The more
authentic Alaskan Bar is across the street at 167 S. Franklin (% 907-586-
1000).
The state’s Russian and Native cultures are well represented at the Alaska
State Museum (395 Whittier St., % 907-465-2901; www.museums.state.
ak.us), which showcases Alaskan art and artifacts. Admission is $5. You
can take a free tour of the Alaska State Capitol (on 4th Street between
Main and Seward; closed Sat afternoon and Sun), which has photo-
murals depicting the early days of Juneau. A couple blocks to the north,
the octagonal chapel of St. Nicholas Orthodox Church (Fifth and Gold
streets) was built by the Tlingits in 1893 and remains an active parish 
to this day. It’s open daily during tourist season. A small donation is
requested.
Specializing in children’s programs, the small but engaging Juneau-
Douglas City Museum (Fourth and Main streets; % 907-586-3572; www.
juneau.org/parksrec/museum) displays artifacts from the city’s his-
tory and gold-mining past. Admission is $4 for adults, free for students
and children 18 and under.
Beyond walking distance: About 3 miles from downtown along the
Egan Expressway, you can visit the Macaulay Salmon Hatchery (2697
Channel Dr.; % 877-463-2486; www.dipac.net), where you get to see
every step of the harvesting and fertilizing of salmon eggs. The resultant
offspring are later released back into the wild. Admission is $3.25 adults,
$1.75 kids. Nearby, off Egan at Vanderbilt Hill Road (then right on Anka
Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 391

St. and right again on Shaune Dr.), the Alaskan Brewing Company (5429
Shaune Dr.; % 907-780-5866; www.alaskanbeer.com) makes that great
Alaskan Amber you see everywhere in the state, as well as several other
beers, ales, and porters. They offer free daily tours with a sampling of
beer at the end.
Keep going down Egan Expressway to Mendenhall Glacier, about 13 miles
from downtown at the head of Mendenhall Valley. The visitor center 
here (% 907-789-0097; www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/districts/
mendenhall) contains a glacier museum with excellent explanatory
models, computerized displays, and ranger talks. Admission is $3. Trails
of various lengths get you closer to the glacier, the easiest being a half-
mile nature trail.
Ketchikan
Because Ketchikan is the southernmost port of call for Southeast Alaska,
residents call it the “first city” — the first port at which ships from
Vancouver or Seattle stop on northbound cruises. Although it is Alaska’s
fifth-largest city (with about 8,000 residents!), it likes to project a quirky/
quaint frontier image, complete with a quirky/quaint old-time red-light
district, Creek Street, which was in full schving until the 1950s. Ketchikan
offers plenty of shopping near the docks, but you can walk past all that
and watch fishing boats set out from the harbor, or head to several sites
that interpret the local Native culture (Ketchikan has the largest concen-
tration of Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian people in Alaska, and the world’s
largest collection of totem poles).
You may be able to find wetter places than Ketchikan, with its average
rainfall of 13 feet per year, but at a certain point you become too damp
to tell the difference. Carry a folding umbrella.
Cruising into port
Ships dock right at the pier in Ketchikan’s downtown.
Scoring the best excursions
Misty Fjords Flightseeing: The 2.3-million-acre, Connecticut-size area of
Misty Fjords National Monument looks like something out of The Lord of
the Rings, with volcanic cliffs rising up to 3,150 feet, dense hemlock and
spruce forests, high ridges covered in alpine grass, and a watery pas-
sage through it all that’s so narrow only small ships can get any signifi-
cant distance in. That’s why the big ships offer these shore excursions,
which fly from Ketchikan by floatplane. Some do a water landing and
then fly out again. Others bring you to an excursion boat for exploration
of the monument, then make the short cruise back to Ketchikan (2–41⁄2
hours; $230–$299).
Saxman Native Village Tour: Not just another tourist attraction, this
arts and cultural center, situated about 21⁄2 miles outside Ketchikan, is
home to hundreds of Tlingit, Tsimshian, and Haida Natives and is a

center for the revival of Native arts and culture. On this excursion, you
tour the grounds, see a performance by the Cape Fox Dancers at the
Beaver Clan House, and listen to traditional Native stories. You may 
also watch artisans demonstrate totem carving (21⁄2 hours; $54).
Sportfishing: You may never get a better chance to catch salmon than
on a chartered fishing boat excursion in this region. The boat crew sup-
plies your fishing gear, tackle, and bait; you catch the fish, and they ship
it home for you, for an added fee (four to six hours; $179 plus $20 for a
fishing license and $10 for a king-salmon tag).
Totem Bight Historical Park Tour: A bus takes you through the Tongass
National Forest to this historic Native fish camp, where you can view the
totem poles and a ceremonial clan house. Some tours also visit points of
interest in Ketchikan (21⁄2 hours; $39).
Rainforest Wildlife Sanctuary: After an 8-mile coastal drive, you do a
half-mile hike with a naturalist guide, trying to spot eagles, bear, seals,

and various birdlife. Afterward, you can feed Alaskan reindeer, watch 
a totem pole carver at work, and take a tour of a historic sawmill
(21⁄2 hours; $79).
Tatoosh Island Sea Kayaking: After a trip to the island by van and
motorboat, you get a quick orientation before heading out on your 90-
minute paddle, where you see some great scenery and (maybe) spot a
few bald eagles and harbor seals (41⁄2 hours; $135).
The Great Alaskan Lumberjack Show: Located a few blocks from the
docks, the show features lumberjack types competing in logrolling,
speed climbing, tree topping, chainsaw carving, and all the other skills
every lumberjack needs. If you don’t book this as an excursion, you can
still buy tickets at the door for the same price (11⁄2 hours; $30).
Exploring on your own
Ketchikan’s downtown port area is completely flat and walkable. Pick up
a walking-tour map at the Ketchikan Visitor Information Center on the
pier. Taxis are also available at the pier if you want to go to Saxman
Indian Village or Totem Bight Park on your own.
Within walking distance: Don’t miss the Southeast Alaska Discovery
Center (50 Main St., only a block from the pier; % 907-228-6214), which
contains an amazing series of dioramas depicting local historical, envi-
ronmental, and cultural themes. Admission is $5. On a smaller scale, the
one-room Tongass Historical Museum (629 Dock St.; % 907-225-5600)
focuses on the Native heritage and history of the city. Admission is $2.
The centerpiece of downtown Ketchikan is Creek Street, a row of quirky/
quaint wooden houses built on pilings above a busy salmon stream. Once
upon a not-so-long-ago time, this was the city’s red-light district, with
more than 30 semi-legal brothels lining the waterway. That all came to an
end in the mid-1950s, and today the houses contain boutiques, restau-
rants, and galleries featuring the work of local artists. Dolly’s House, at
#24 (% 907-225-2279), preserves one of the last of the brothels, with
tours costing $4. At the end of Creek Street, a funicular takes you uphill to
the Westmark Cape Fox Lodge, which offers nice views and a small collec-
tion of Native carvings out back. Walk through the lobby and follow the
signs to the Married Men’s Trail, allegedly a route taken by local men to
get to Creek Street, back in the day. It makes for a nice little hike back into
town. Watch your footing, as it can be slippery.
You can find totem poles all over town, but you can admire the biggest
collection of 19th-century totem poles in the world indoors at the Totem
Heritage Center (601 Deermount St., a bit of a hike from the lodge and
town; % 907-225-5900; www.city.ketchikan.ak.us/departments/
museums/totem.html). Built by the city in 1976, the place has 33 origi-
nal totems retrieved from several Native villages, kept in their original,
unrestored condition, sometimes with moss still attached. Traditionally,
totem poles are meant to disintegrate naturally, usually lasting about 
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
394

70 years, but these were preserved to help keep the culture alive.
Admission is $5.
Beyond walking distance: The Alaska Division of Parks maintains
Totem Bight State Historical Park (% 907-247-8574; www.dnr.state.
ak.us/parks/units/totembgh.htm), about 10 miles outside of town
on the North Tongass Highway (a short walk through the woods is
involved), for the preservation of Tlingit totem poles, clan house, and
other artifacts, carved beginning in 1938 as part of a New Deal/Civilian
Conservation Corps project for Native craftsmen. Admission is free.
Visitors can also view Native artifacts at Saxman Totem Park (% 907-
225-4846; www.capefoxtours.com), located about 21⁄2 miles south of
Ketchikan on the South Tongass Highway in the Saxman Native Village.
The place is really set up more for people on excursions (see the preced-
ing “Scoring the best excursions” section), but you can also see totem
poles and the carving studio without joining a tour, using a pamphlet
that costs $1.50 (note, however, that interpretive materials are scant
compared to those at Totem Bight).
Sitka
Sitka is our favorite port in Southeast Alaska, with a perfect blend of a
gorgeous location, genuinely fascinating historical attractions, and a
neighborly small-city vibe that hasn’t been touristed out of existence.
Main reason for that? Sitka isn’t on the Inside Passage, sitting instead 
on the Pacific coast of Baranof Island, sheltered by a fringe of barrier
islands. Big ships have to go all the way around to reach it, and then
bring passengers in by tender — so not too many do.
History is the big draw here. The rich, powerful, and sophisticated
Kiksadi Tlingit clan called this part of Baranof Island home for centuries,
but in 1799, the Russians arrived, intent on extending their trade empire.
War flared, with the Tlingit initially getting the upper hand, but by 1804
they’d been forced from the town area. From then until the American
purchase of Alaska in 1867, Sitka was the capital of Russia in the New
World.
Cruising into port
Most passengers arrive in Sitka by tender because the harbor is too
small to accommodate large ships. Tenders drop you right in the down-
town area, where small ships can also dock. Maps are available at the
volunteer-staffed visitor information desk at Harrigan Centennial Hall,
which also houses the Isabel Miller Museum and the auditorium where
the New Archangel Dancers perform. The other docking facility is at the
nearby O’Connell Bridge, where you can pick up maps from a volunteer
at the information kiosk (mornings only). Map boards are located near
both docking facilities. You can take a free shuttle bus around town,
though the downtown area begins right at the water.

Scoring the best excursions
Sitka Historical Tour: On this bus tour, you visit the city’s main histori-
cal attractions, including St. Michael’s Cathedral, the Russian Cemetery,
Castle Hill, and Sitka’s National Historic Park with its totem poles and
forest trails. The tour is often combined with a performance by the New
Archangel Dancers and/or a visit to the Alaska Raptor Rehabilitation
Center (three hours; $45).
Sea Otter and Wildlife Quest: For a chance to spot wildlife ranging from
otters to bears, visit Salisbury Sound by jet boat, with a naturalist along
who explains the area’s marine ecosystem and points out critters along
the way (three hours; $117).
People of the Tides: Explore Sitka Sound in a catamaran, visit the Dog
Point Fish Camp, pass Redoubt St. Michael (Russia’s first outpost in the
region), and take a short walk through the rainforest with a Native guide
to find out how Southeast Alaska’s Native peoples have lived for thou-
sands of years (three hours; $165).

Sport-Fishing: An experienced captain guides your fully equipped boat to
a good spot for halibut and salmon; the rest is up to you. Your catch can
be frozen or smoked and shipped to your home, if you wish (four hours;
$189 plus $20 for a fishing license and another $10 for a king-salmon tag).
Exploring on your own
Sitka is easy to explore on your own. Maps are available at the Harrigan
Centennial Hall (see the preceding section “Cruising into port”).
Within walking distance: You can’t miss St. Michael’s Cathedral, sit-
ting right in the center of town and adorned with a striking onion-shaped
dome. Though originally built in the 1840s (by Russian bishop Innocent
Veniaminov), the current structure is actually an exact replica, the first
church having burned to the ground in 1966. Sitkans saved the icons,
paintings, and other treasures, though, which you can see after you drop
$2 in the collection box.
Bishop Innocent’s 1842 home, called (duh) the Russian Bishop’s House
(% 907-747-6281; www.nps.gov/sitk/home.htm), is located a few
blocks east at Lincoln and Monastery streets. A fascinating place, it’s
owned and operated by the National Park Service, with ranger-led tours
of the upstairs living quarters and a self-guided museum downstairs.
Bishop Innocent was one impressive dude, an expert in architecture,
carpentry (he built some of the furniture on display), ethnography,
clock-making, and linguistics. Admission costs $4.
A little farther down Lincoln, on the grounds of Sheldon Jackson College,
the Sheldon Jackson Museum (% 907-747-8981; www.museums.state.
ak.us) contains a fine collection of Native artifacts. Admission is $4.
Continue down Lincoln till you come to the Sitka National Historical
Park (% 907-747-6281; www.nps.gov/sitk). This is where, in 1804, the
Tlingit made their stand against Russia, holding off imperial gunboats
and Aleut mercenaries for six days before finally melting away one night
after taking heavy losses. Today it’s a 113-acre National Historic Park,
with historical and cultural exhibits indoors at the visitor center and a
rain forest trail that winds along the coast, passing an amazing collec-
tion of towering totem poles. Admission is $4.
Back downtown, Castle Hill (up the stairs near the intersection of
Lincoln and Katlian streets) was where the first U.S. flag was raised on
Alaska soil, after the U.S. and Russia held a transfer ceremony here in
1867. You get a great panoramic view of town from the top. Across the
street, next to the Sitka Pioneers retirement home, the Sheetka’Kwaan
Naa Kahidi Building (200 Katlian St.; % 888-270-8687; www.sitka
tribal.com) is a modern version of a traditional Tlingit tribal house,
hosting regular performances of traditional Tlingit dance. Show times
are posted here and at the Centennial Hall, where another troupe, the
New Archangel Dancers, performs traditional Russian and Ukrainian
dance, with an all-woman company.
Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 397

Beyond walking distance (just about): At the Alaska Raptor Center
(1101 Sawmill Creek Blvd.; % 907-747-8662; www.alaskaraptor.org),
visitors can observe owls, hawks, and bald eagles from just a few feet
away. The center was opened in 1980 to treat sick or injured birds of prey
(primarily eagles), and to provide an educational experience for visitors.
Birds that cannot be returned to the wild are sent to zoos or housed here
permanently. Admission is $12 for adults, $6 for kids under 12.
Skagway
Skagway was once a rootin’ tootin’, six-gun-shootin’ wild west town
where thousands of wanna-be prospectors played cards, slugged booze,
spit tobacco juice, and generally wrought havoc before heading up the
Chilkoot Trail or the White Pass toward the Yukon, where they’d either
(a) die of exposure, (b) strike it rich, or (c) give up and head back before
ever getting to their destination.
The boom eventually went bust, as booms do, but the people who
remained had the good sense to recognize the historic value of their
town rather than knocking it all down to “modernize.” Today the whole
downtown is run by the National Park Service as a historic district, but
don’t expect a pristine museum. Instead, most of those historic build-
ings house shops that sell hokey T-shirts, souvenirs, and even (eek)
Starbucks coffee. It’s the Gold Rush all over again, but this time the
gold’s in your wallet, and they want it bad.
If you’re like us, you’ll make a quick pass through a few of the tourist
shops and then concentrate on the really worthwhile attractions, of
which there are several.
Cruising into port
The cruise piers lie at the foot of Broadway or off Congress or Terminal
Way. Though the docks are in sight of downtown, it’s about a 20-minute
walk, so take one of the frequent shuttle buses if you don’t feel like hoof-
ing it.
Scoring the best excursions
White Pass and Yukon Route Railway: From the dock, ride this famous
narrow-gauge railway — complete with vintage parlor cars — past parts
of the old prospectors’ trail and stunning waterfalls to the White Pass
Summit, which marks the U.S./Canadian border. Now the caveat: Don’t
bother going on an overcast day — you won’t see anything. For that
reason, you may want to try getting tickets when you get to town rather
than booking the tour. Schedule info is available at www.wpyr.com
(31⁄2 hours; $100).
Dyea Ghost Town Bicycle Tour: Dyea, about 9 miles west, was estab-
lished around the same time as Skagway but was abandoned completely
after the Gold Rush. On this tour, you go partway by van before gearing

up for a 6-mile bicycle ride through the remains of the town, past coastal
tidal flats and wildflower fields (three hours; $80).
Sled Dog Musher’s Camp: An introduction to the sled-dog life, with 
a tour of a musher’s camp, a 20-minute ride through the forest on a
wheeled sled, and best of all, a chance to cuddle (awwwww!) husky pups
(23⁄4 hours; $109).
Klondike Bicycle Tour: After vanning it to the White Pass summit, you
pedal down the Klondike Highway, 15 miles from peak to sea, pausing
along the way for photos (21⁄2 hours; $80).
Skagway by Streetcar: This tour makes for an entertaining theater expe-
rience. Guides wearing period costume and juiced with theatricality
drive you around town, telling stories about the good old days and
showing you the highlights both inside and just outside town, including
the old Gold Rush Cemetery. Sore feet and a high tolerance for hokum?
Sign here (two hours; $39).
Exploring on your own
Practically everything in Skagway is located either on or just off
Broadway. Once in town from the docks, you can walk to everything.
Walking maps describing the historic buildings and trail maps of the sur-
rounding area (with hikes from 1 to 10 miles, departing from trailheads
right in town) are available at the Arctic Brotherhood Hall on Broadway
(between 2nd and 3rd) and at the National Historic Park Visitor Center
(% 907-983-2921; www.nps.gov/klgo), located next to the White Pass
& Yukon Route railroad depot, just off the corner of 2nd and Broadway.
Within walking distance: Although you can certainly explore any of the
historic downtown buildings on your own, you may want to take one of

the short tours from the Historic Park Visitor Center (see contact infor-
mation in the preceding paragraph). Offered several times a day, these
tours show you around the White Pass & Yukon Railway Depot; Soapy’s
Parlor, a preserved saloon once owned by notorious Gold Rush shyster
and all-around badman Soapy Smith; the Moore Cabin, Skagway’s origi-
nal homestead; and the Mascot Saloon, a museum that simulates a 19th-
century tavern.
Across Broadway from the visitor center, the Arctic Brotherhood Hall
(see first paragraph in this section) is one of the more photographed
buildings in Southeast Alaska, its facade covered in thousands of pieces
of driftwood. On the same block, the Red Onion Saloon (% 907-983-
2222) was originally a dance hall and honky-tonk. Today, bartenders still
serve drinks over the same mahogany bar they used a century ago and
waitresses dress in busty period dance-hall outfits. Upstairs was once a
bordello, and now offers a really interesting tour for $5, led by yet more
young women in flouncy outfits. The rooms have been re-created to look
as they did in the 1890s.
At the other end of town, the Skagway Museum (at Seventh Avenue and
Spring Street; % 907-983-2420) is a very professional display offering a
look at Skagway’s history through artifacts, photographs, and historical
records. Admission is $2. Back on Broadway, at the Eagles Hall, the old-
timey Days of ’98 Show has been playing since 1927, featuring 1890s-
style dancing girls, ragtime music, a recitation of Robert Service poetry,
and a reenactment of the famous shootout between bad guy Soapy
Smith and good guy Frank Reid. The show is almost always offered as
part of a shore excursion, but you can buy tickets at the door for $14.
Two shows are scheduled during the day (10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.)
while ships are in port.
If you’re up for a little walk, stroll down Seventh then about a mile up
State Street to the old Gold Rush Cemetery, where Smith and Reid are
both buried — Reid within the cemetery, Smith just outside.
Victoria, British Columbia
Alaskan cruises that start in San Francisco or Seattle frequently call at
Victoria, the capital of British Columbia. Located on Vancouver Island,
this lovely little city boasts gorgeous Victorian architecture, lovely gar-

Scoring the best excursions
Butchart Gardens: World-renowned Butchart Gardens are set in a
former quarry (see details in the following “Exploring on your own” sec-
tion). Tours that just include the gardens cost $60 (31⁄2 hours). Expanded
trips include high tea at the gardens (four hours; $98) or combine a visit
to Craigdarroch Castle with a visit and gourmet picnic at the gardens
(five hours; $149).
Victoria Pub Crawl: Visit three of the city’s finest pubs and sample its
best local brews (31⁄2 hours; $69).
Orca- and Wildlife-Watching Adventure: Sail by catamaran off southern
Vancouver Island for probable sightings of killer whales, seals, and por-
poises (31⁄2 hours; $109).

Exploring on your own
Shuttles are available from Ogden Point to the Inner Harbor, the center
of Victoria. You can find walking maps right on the waterfront at the
Visitors Information Center (812 Wharf St.).
Within walking distance: For afternoon tea, including perfect scones
and genuine clotted cream (at a stiff $34 a head), visit the elegant
Fairmont Empress Hotel (721 Government St.; % 250-384-8111; www.
fairmont.com/empress), dating to 1908. Many shore excursions
include tea here, but if you plan to go on your own, call two weeks
before your cruise for reservations and be sure to follow the dress 
code: no sleeveless shirts, tank tops, short-shorts, or cut-offs.
Just to the east sits the Royal British Columbia Museum (675 Belleville
St.; % 888-447-7977; http://rbcm1.rbcm.gov.bc.ca), offering
exhibits highlighting British Columbia’s natural history, First People’s
history, and Victoria’s recent past. Admission is $13 adults, $8.50 kids 6
to 18. Adjacent is Thunderbird Park, displaying totem poles and a cere-
monial house. Helmecken House (10 Elliot St.), next to the park, was
once a pioneer doctor’s home and now displays some pioneering med-
ical devices that remind you how painful life on the frontier could be.
Beyond walking distance: Craigdarroch Castle (1050 Joan Crescent;
% 250-592-5323; www.craigdarrochcastle.com) was built in the
1880s as the home of millionaire Scottish coal magnate Robert Dunsmuir.
Four stories high and containing 39 rooms, it’s topped with stone turrets
and furnished in opulent Victoria splendor. Admission is $10 adults,
$3.15 kids 6 to 18. City bus routes 11 and 14 drop you off at the foot of
Joan Crescent, a two-minute walk to the castle’s doorstep, or you can get
there by taxi in less than ten minutes.
For a more floral take on Victoria, visit the 130-acre Butchart Gardens
(800 Benevenuto Ave., in Brentwood Bay; % 250-652-5256; www.
butchartgardens.com), about 13 miles north of downtown Victoria on
the Saanich Peninsula. Started as a beautification project by the wife of a
quarry owner, it eventually became the couple’s passion, and today fea-
tures English, Italian, and Japanese gardens, water gardens, and rose gar-
dens. Admission is $21 adults, $10 kids 13 to 17, $2.25 kids 5 to 12. You
can catch a public bus from downtown, or a cab, or visit as part of a
shore excursion.

Chapter 17
Meandering in the
Mediterranean
In This Chapter
 Touring Europe by sea
 Getting on board
 Exchanging currency at ports of call
 Finding the best attractions and shopping in each port
 Sussing out the best shore excursions
A
Mediterranean cruise appeals to people who want more than just
fun in the sun. Sure, you find glistening beaches with semi-nude
bodies (in the French Riviera anyway) and such diversions as shopping
and casinos (think Monte Carlo). But you also find incredible scenery,
medieval cities and castles, historic estates, and some of the best muse-
ums in the world. History lurks around every corner, and ancient sites
such as Ephesus in Turkey can leave you drop-jawed. Cultural and culi-
nary opportunities also abound, so a lunch or dinner ashore is a must.
The Mediterranean ports are close together, too, so your ship generally
visits several European countries — typically Spain, France, and Italy on
a western Mediterranean itinerary, and Greece, Turkey, and sometimes
Italy on an eastern Mediterranean itinerary.
Unlike Alaskan and Caribbean cruises — which, despite the rise of 
many alternative options, still tend to sail round-trip from a few major
homeports — Mediterranean and other European cruises are mostly
open-jawed: sailing from any of a dozen different port cities and ending
in another. The most popular ports of embarkation and debarkation
include most of those covered in this chapter, plus Genoa, Italy, and
Dover and Southampton in the UK.
Another big draw of a Europe cruise is the price. With the euro sky high
these days, booking a cruise and pre-paying in U.S. dollars is a great
hedge against currency fluctuations. Plus, the fact that meals and enter-
tainment are included in the cruise fare makes cruising one of the more
economical ways of seeing Europe.

Hitting the Town
Since many European cities have their cruise docks right in the old his-
toric parts of town, cruising in Europe is like cruising right into history.
Coming into Istanbul, for example, you’re treated to views of the ancient
minarets and domes of the shimmering Blue Mosque, the 1,500-year-old
St. Sophia cathedral, and the outrageously ornate Topkapi Palace.
Entering Malta’s Grand Harbour at a snail’s pace affords breathtaking
views of the honey-colored stone fortifications that rise up like ornate
sand castles from the shoreline. It sure beats the view from a train.
Once you arrive, you might want to do some exploring. You can either
venture off on your own, which sometimes is the best way to handle
your day, or sign up for your ship’s organized tours, many of which
focus on history and culture. As in the Caribbean and Alaska, local con-
tractors, rather than the cruise lines, conduct the tours, which are often
offered in several languages, with (for instance) English-speaking guides
for one group, German-speaking for another, and so on. Some of the
more upscale and educational lines have expert lecturers who accom-
pany shore excursions.
The prices we list for shore excursions are for 2006 and may go up
slightly in 2007. All prices in this section are in U.S. dollars.
If touring on your own, in some ports you can walk to the best sights
from the docks, but in others the major attractions are some distance
away. In most ports, renting a car is both a hassle and expensive, so
you’re better off hiring a car and driver. By getting together a small
group, you can split the price of the cab and save money. Your ship’s
tour office can usually offer tips about taxis. In some ports, public trans-
portation, such as buses, subways, and trains, is also an option.
At many famed sites, such as Pompeii, you can rent audio tour headsets,
so you can tour on your own.
For touring, keep in mind that some churches, mosques, and other reli-
gious sites are more conservative than others, so both men and women
should wear long pants or skirts (shorts and short skirts are a no-no)
and avoid wearing sleeveless shirts.
Boarding Ship in Europe
As with cruise ship departures in the Caribbean, Alaska, and elsewhere,
ships typically start boarding passengers in the early afternoon on the
first day and then depart in the early evening. If you fly into the port of
embarkation that day, however, the ship may allow you to board earlier —
the cruise lines know people are generally exhausted after an overseas
flight.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
404

Minding Your Money
If you want to buy something at the ports in the Mediterranean, you
have to exchange your dollars for local currency (on the ship, at a bank,
or at a currency exchange), get money from a local ATM, or use your
charge card. In most cases in the Mediterranean (Turkey excluded, at
least for now), the official currency is the euro. At press time, the euro
exchange rate was US$1 = .79€ or 1€ = US$1.27. Turkey has the Turkish
new lira; the exchange at press time was US$1 = 1.53 lira or 1 lira =
US65¢. However, because exchange rates fluctuate, you should check an
international newspaper or an online currency converter to get the most
up-to-date rates. Try the handy currency calculator at www.xe.com.
The French Riviera & Monaco
The French Riviera, also known as the Côte d’Azur, is the place of
dreams, where beautiful mountains and a very blue sea combine with
yachts and high culture to create a playground for the rich, the famous,
and you and us too. Artists drawn to the landscape over the centuries
have included Matisse, Cocteau, Picasso, Leger, Renoir, and Bonnard,
and their legacy remains in a host of wonderful museums. Medieval
cities are within easy reach, as are numerous shopping opportunities.
Cannes, Monte Carlo, Nice, St-Tropez, and Villefranche are all strung
along the Riviera, and are so close together geographically that they
offer nearly the same out-of-town shore excursions.
Cannes is a bustling commercial center, famous for the international
Cannes Film Festival held there every year in mid-May. The city offers
easily accessible beaches and plenty of shopping prospects. Nice is nice.
It really is. What was once a Victorian playground for the aristocracy is
now a big middle-class city with much to offer visitors, including great
art museums and shopping opportunities. Actress Brigitte Bardot made
St-Tropez famous, and fun-in-the-sun still thrives in this artist colony.
Although residents and visitors proudly uphold its reputation for hedo-
nism (topless and even bottomless sunbathers bask at beaches outside
of town), you can find some quaintness mixed in as well. The village of
Villefranche-Sur-Mer, located between Nice and Monaco, is known for
having one of the most beautiful harbors in the Mediterranean. The
town itself dates to about 130 B.C., and today the medieval Old Town
beckons with red-tiled roofs, narrow roads and stairways, boats bobbing
in the harbor, and the 16th-century St-Elme citadel.
Surrounded on three sides by France (and on one by the ocean), the 370-
acre municipality of Monaco is the world’s second-smallest independent
state, after the island of Nauru in the South Pacific. It has symbolized
glamour for centuries, especially in 1956, when Prince Rainier married
American actress Grace Kelly after their meeting at the Cannes film 
festival.

Chapter 17: Meandering in the Mediterranean 407

Cruising into port
Only the smallest ships can dock at piers in these towns — for example,
the 110-passenger SeaDream yachts and 208-passenger Seabourn ships
can dock in Cannes, Monte Carlo, and Nice, and the Silversea ships can
dock in Nice and Monte Carlo. Otherwise you anchor offshore and
tender in. The plus to this is that the views of the Riviera are awesome
from the ships’ anchorages, which are never that far offshore, making for
speedy jaunts into town. Many ships, including the largest ones, anchor
offshore from Villefranche, and once on land, passengers are free to
explore the coast. The ship and/or tender piers are all located right in
town at each of the French Riviera ports, so you can walk right into the
thick of things. If you don’t sign up for a tour, you can take a pricey taxi
to another spot on the Riviera, or hop on one of the much less expensive
trains that run along the coastline. Monte Carlo, for example, is only a
20-minute ride from Villefranche.
Scoring the best excursions
The best way to explore the French Riviera ports is on your own. You
needn’t book an excursion unless you have problems with walking or
you want to travel to a town other than the one your ship visits, such as
St-Paul-de-Vence: This walled medieval city offers art galleries and
shops, cobblestone streets, cafes, and gorgeous country views, as well
as a world-renowned modern art museum, Fondation Maeght. Trip is
often combined with other stops, including Nice (four hours; $52).
Medieval Eze: The French medieval town of Eze clings to the rocks
above the sea. A guided walk takes you on narrow streets past lovely
restored houses with stunning ocean views. Tours also allot some time
for you to check out boutiques and artists’ studios (four hours; $52).
Longer, more expensive versions of this tour add visits to other towns,
such as Monaco and Nice.
Exploring on your own
Taxis are available at all the piers, but they are expensive. (You may
want to double up with other passengers if you plan to go any long dis-
tance.) You can walk from all the ports to many of the main local attrac-
tions. You can also take the great train service between cities on the
Côte d’Azur, as well as the local bus service. In St-Tropez, you can rent
bikes (for $13–$15 an hour) to get to the more daring beaches.
Cannes, France
Within walking distance: Those glamorous grand hotels you see on 
television during the annual Cannes Film Festival are located on the
seafront, close to the ship pier. Also within walking distance of the 
pier are some free public beaches (including Plage du Midi and Plage
Gazagnaire), and hotel-owned beaches where you pay a fee (somewhere
between $20 and $30) and in return get a beach mattress, a sun umbrella,

and showers. The most popular of these is Plage de la Croisette, which
runs east from the Vieux Port (old port). You can shop near the pier at
world-famous boutiques, including major Paris brands such as Saint
Laurent, Rykiel, and Hermès, which you can find on La Croisette, the
main drag facing the sea and the beach. More affordable, but still quite
fashionable, shopping is a few blocks inland on rue d’Antibes.
Beyond walking distance: Across the bay from Cannes are the Lérins
Islands, including Ile Ste-Marguerite, where the unlucky man immortal-
ized in The Man in the Iron Mask was imprisoned. You can visit his 
cell. The island also boasts a maritime museum and nice family-run
restaurants. The trip is about 15 minutes and ferries offered by several
companies depart every half-hour from the port. The round-trip fare is
about $16.
Monte Carlo, Monaco
Within walking distance: There’s nothing like a walk through Monte
Carlo; you really do see playboys in sports cars zipping around the
streets — when they’re not hanging out in their million-dollar yachts
moored in the harbor. These people apparently don’t have day jobs.
When exploring this city, you can walk up some steep hills or use the
municipality’s system of public elevators to be lifted from, say, the
harbor to the casino area. Keep in mind that laws prohibit you from
walking around town in swimsuits, bare-chested, or barefoot.
The Monte Carlo Casino (www.casino-monte-carlo.com) at Place du
Casino lets you put on your finery and play James Bond. Built in 1878,
the casino is wonderfully ornate but surprisingly small. Admission is
about $13, and you must show your passport. The casino admits no one
under 18. At night, men must wear a jacket and tie. To get a whiff of the
Monte Carlo lifestyle, check out the gazillion-dollar cars parked outside
the casino.
Beyond walking distance: You can walk from the harbor to the city’s
historic area, but because the uphill hike is only for the vigorous, we put
it in this section. Try taking a cab uphill, and then walk back down.
On a high hill above the port, Place du Palais includes the Italianate
home of the Grimaldis, the royal family of Monaco. Tours of Les Grands
Appartements du Palais include the throne room and art collection plus
a separate museum with many Napoleonic items. Admission is about
$7.75 to the palace, $5 to the museum. At 11:55 a.m., a ten-minute chang-
ing-of-the-guard ceremony takes place outside. The view from the palace
includes all of Monte-Carlo and the port but also stretches as far as Italy
to the northeast and Fontvieille and Cap-d’Ail to the southwest.
The Oceanographic Museum (www.oceano.mc), on avenue St-Martin,
fascinates visitors with over 90 fish tanks that exhibit more than 4,000
species of fish and over 200 families of invertebrates. Admission is $14
for adults, $7.75 for children 6 to 18, and free for children 5 and under.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
410

Nice, France
Within walking distance: Don your designer sandals and latest bag and
stroll from the harbor to old town, where colorful houses line narrow
streets, and to the Flower Market area, full of outdoor cafes and great
places for people-watching. On Mondays, you can browse a wonderful
antiques market here. A few blocks inland, you find plenty of shopping
opportunities for high fashion, Provencal wares, and more, especially 
on rue Masséna, place Magenta, and rue Paradis. You may also find it
worth a trek uphill (as in Monaco, you can also use the public elevators)
to Le Château Park, which offers spectacular views (and prime photo
ops) over the rooftops of Nice, as well as an old cemetery, a waterfall,
gardens, walking paths, and the ruins of a medieval castle.
Also within walking distance of the ship pier is promenade des Anglais,
a wide boulevard stretching several miles on the bay, with beaches
(where teeny bikinis rule), cafes, and historic buildings, including
Victorian hotels.
Beyond walking distance: Nice boasts many great art museums. The
Musée Matisse (www.musee-matisse-nice.org), located in a lovely
setting in Cimiez on a hill above Nice, contains a collection donated by
Matisse and his heirs, including Nude in an Armchair with a Green Plant
and other famous paintings, along with practice sketches, designs, and
items from the artist’s own collection and home. Admission is $5. About
a 15-minute walk away, also in Cimiez, the Musée National Message
Biblique Marc-Chagall (www.musee-chagall.fr) features a collection
donated by Chagall and his wife that includes oils, gouaches, drawings,
pastels, lithographs, and sculptures, as well as a mosaic and stained-
glass windows. A brochure is available in English to help you understand
the biblical themes the artworks depict. Admission is about $8.25. To 
the west, at the Promenade des Arts, the Museum of Contemporary 
and Modern Art (www.mamac-nice.org) displays a collection tracing
European and American contemporary art from the 1960s to the present,
including works by Richard Serra, Christo, Andy Warhol, and Robert
Mapplethorpe. Admission is about $5.
St-Tropez, France
Within walking distance: Free public beaches, including Plage de la
Bouillabaisse and Plage des Graniers, are close to the center of town.
You can find good shopping at a wealth of antiques and art galleries in
the city’s old town. Celebrities visit here often, so keep your eyes peeled.
L’Annonciade Musée St-Tropez, at Place Georges-Grammont, is an art
museum located in a former chapel with a renowned modern art collec-
tion. Admission is about $6.75.
Beyond walking distance: Clothing-optional beaches, including Plage
de Pampellone and Plage de Tahiti, are located a few miles outside
town, along Pampellone Bay. All are hotel-run and charge a use fee of
about $15 to $25, which includes a beach chair and other amenities.
Chapter 17: Meandering in the Mediterranean 411

Villefranche-Sur-Mer, France
Within walking distance: This little town provides a nice setting for a
walk, if you don’t head into Nice (4 miles away) or Monte Carlo (about
10 miles away). Jean Cocteau left his legacy here in the form of frescoes
on the 14th-century walls of the Romanesque Chapelle St-Pierre on Quai
de al Douane/rue des Mariniéres. Admission is about $3.50.
Beyond walking distance: Head to nearby Nice, about 4 miles away.
Check out the previous section on Nice for info on the sites.
Greece
Welcome to the cradle of western civilization, where ancient sites and
architectural treasures join forces with the sun, scenery, and food to
create one of the best vacation spots on Earth. Be ready for a feast for
the mind and the senses, a place that is exotic but at the same time
friendly and familiar, where something always reminds you of the past.
Athens
This fabled metropolis, home of the original (and the 2004) Olympic
Games, intersperses ancient monuments, tavernas, and neoclassical build-
ings with high rises, fast-food outlets, and souvenir shops, especially at
the Pláka, the oldest continuously inhabited section of the city and now
the site of restaurants and a major market. The Parthenon and the treas-
ures on display at the National Archaeological Museum best reflect the
image most of us have of ancient Greece. But in reality, modern Athens is
crowded, teems with taxis and cars, and is a hard place to get around. The
city is also polluted and very hot during the summer. An organized tour 
is a good bet here. If you do spend the day on your own, check out the
Acropolis, have lunch in the Pláka, and accept that you don’t have time 
to see everything, so pick the places most important to you.
Cruising into port
Ships dock in the major port of Piraeus, located about 7 miles southwest
of Athens, but the trip may seem much longer due to traffic. You can take
a metro train or taxi into the city or hop the bus service that most cruise
lines offer for a fee. See the following section “Exploring on your own.”
Scoring the best excursions
Half-Day Athens City Tour: Half-day tours usually include a guided tour of
the Acropolis; a drive past other Athens highlights, including Constitution
Square, the Parliament, the Temple of Zeus, Hadrian’s Arch, and
Olympic Stadium; plus time for souvenir shopping (four hours; $58).
Full-day Athens Tours: Full-day tours usually add a visit to the National
Archaeological Museum and time to shop in the Pláka, plus lunch (eight
hours; $125).
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
412

Ancient Athens in Depth: For visitors interested in ancient history.
Visits the Acropolis, the Parthenon, the Ancient Agora, a temple honor-
ing Athena and Poseidon, the Stoa of Attalus Museum, the Thission
Temple, and other sites, and includes lunch (71⁄2 hours; $129).
Exploring on your own
If you want to take a taxi, the average meter fare from Piraeus to Syntagma
Square (the hub of Athens tourism) should be around $10 or $12, but
many drivers may quote a flat rate as high as $25. Try bargaining or find
another taxi driver willing to turn on the meter.
Greek taxi drivers don’t always accept you as a fare. They usually ask
where you want to go and are free to decline if they don’t want to go
your way; consequently, allow a fair amount of time to find a cab. Also, a
driver may stop and pick up two or three different parties to fill the cab.
If this happens, you’re responsible only for your leg of the journey.
The Athens Metro (subway) system is a fast and inexpensive way to get
around. You can walk from the cruise pier to the Piraeus station and ride
right to the Acropolis or Syntagma Square for about $1. A day pass is
available for about $4.
Within walking distance: Piraeus is a gritty port city without the kind
of ancient attractions (or pretty much any other kind) that you find in
Athens. Ship aficionados may enjoy a walk around the enormous port
area, but everyone else should head into Athens.
In the summer, start out as early as possible in the morning, when the
sun isn’t at its strongest and the crowds aren’t as overwhelming.
Beyond walking distance: For many centuries, the Acropolis (www.
culture.gr) was the religious center of Athens. At various periods, it
served as the seat of a king and the “home” of gods and goddesses.
Because it rests on a hilltop, you can glimpse it from many parts of the
city. The complex’s most striking structures are the Parthenon (the
most recognized Greek monument; a temple dedicated to Athena), 
the Propylaea (the gateway to the Acropolis), the Temple of Athena
Nike (built in the fifth century B.C. and restored in the 1930s), and the
Erechtheion (the main temple, divided into two sections — one devoted
to Athena and the other to Poseidon). You can’t enter the Parthenon
itself due to preservation and restoration restrictions. Admission to the
Acropolis complex is about $15 for adults, free for persons under 18
(includes same-day admission to the Acropolis Museum and the
National Archeological Museum).
The National Archeological Museum, 44 Patission St. near Omonia
Square (www.culture.gr) has one of the richest collections of ancient
Greek art in the world and was renovated for the 2004 Olympics.
Admission is about $9, free for anyone under 18.

Mykonos
Think picture-postcard perfect. Hora, Mykonos’s main town, dazzles
with whitewashed homes, their doors and window frames painted bright
Grecian blue. Pelicans, the mascots of Mykonos, greet you at the pier,
and as you explore the cobblestone streets you encounter windmills,
outdoor cafes, small churches with blue domes, and a harbor lined with
fishing boats, all within easy walking distance of the pier. It’s a very
quaint atmosphere, despite the large numbers of sun-seekers, the town’s
well-deserved party reputation (especially in July and Aug), and the
inevitable souvenir shops.
Unlike other Greek islands that cruise ships visit, Mykonos has no
ancient ruins. Passengers starving for sacred sites of note can catch a
shore excursion to nearby Delos, the legendary birthplace of Apollo.
Mykonos is the best place for scuba diving in the Aegean, especially in
September. The most well-established diving center is the Mykonos
Diving Center at Psarou Beach (% and fax 30-22890-24-808; www.
dive.gr).
Cruising into port
Your ship’s tender delivers you to the main harbor area along the
Esplanade in Hora right in the center of things.
Scoring the best excursions
Delos Apollo Sanctuary: Travel by small boat from Mykonos harbor to
Delos for a two-hour guided walking tour of this tiny island that once
served as the religious and commercial hub of the Aegean Sea. Now the
sanctuary is home only to ancient ruins and their caretakers. Also visit
the Archaeological Museum (four hours; $60).
Exploring on your own
The central bus station is located off the left of the harbor, and the bus
service is quite good, heading to all the beaches. Still, the best way to
get around town is to walk. Or, you can choose from two types of taxis.
The standard cab, which you can find at Mavro (“Taxi”) Square, can take
you outside of town. A notice board at the square displays rates. Smaller
scooter taxis with a cart for passengers also zip through the narrow
streets of Hora; you can find them at the pier. More information on all
the following sites can be found at www.mykonos.gr.
Within walking distance: Hora itself is the main attraction here, and
the best activity is to simply wander, browse the art galleries and sou-
venir shops, or sit in a cafe and people-watch. You can also stop by the
Archaeological Museum near the harbor to view finds from Delos.
Admission is about $3.75 for adults; free for those under 18.
Beyond walking distance: About 4 miles east of Hora lies Mykonos’s
second town, Ano Mera, which has a more traditional ambience and

some religious sites of note. The Monastery of Panayia Tourliani
(Monastery of the Virgin Mary of Tourliani) dates to 1580 and has a hand-
somely carved steeple, as well as a small religious museum inside. You
can also visit the 18th-century Monastery of Paleokastro nearby, which
sits near a medieval Byzantine castle and a prehistoric grave marker.
Rhodes
Imagine that the Colossus of Rhodes, the giant bronze statue of sun god
Helios, towered over the very same harbor that now welcomes cruise
ships. Wow. Rich in history, Rhodes is blessed with beautiful beaches,

mountain villages, and fertile plains. The island’s most famous inhabi-
tants were the Knights of St. John, who came in 1291 after fleeing
Jerusalem. They reigned for more than two centuries, and their treas-
ures remain within the medieval walls of the old town of Rhodes (the
city shares its name with the island). Lindos, a picturesque village about
50 minutes from Rhodes city, boasts the Acropolis at Lindos, which
rises about 400 feet above a beautiful bay (though the beauty can be
somewhat diminished on days the place gets terribly crowded).
Cruising into port
Ships dock at the commercial harbor, which is within walking distance of
Rhodes’s old section. The new town is also within walking distance, but
the old town offers more sights of interest.
Scoring the best excursions
Rhodes and Lindos: Travel by bus through the scenic countryside to
Lindos, a medieval walled city with a history that dates to ancient times.
Walk or take a donkey up to the ancient Acropolis to see ruins and great
views (you pass souvenir shops on the way). The trip may include a
walking tour of old town Rhodes; a stop at a workshop selling Rhodian
ceramics; and/or a visit to the ruins of ancient Rhodes, the Temple of
Apollo, and Diagoras Stadium (41⁄2 hours; $52).
Exploring on your own
The best way to explore both the old and new sections of Rhodes is on
foot. If you want to see other parts of the island, you can find taxis at the
end of the pier. Negotiate fares with taxi drivers for sightseeing. Public
buses are also available. For more information on the following sites,
check out www.rhodes.gr.
Within walking distance: The old town of Rhodes is the oldest
medieval town in Europe and offers plenty of beauty. Be forewarned,
though: You can easily get lost in the maze of streets, few of which have
names. The 15th-century Hospital of the Knights, now home of the
Archaeological Museum, features fine works from the Mycenaean and
Roman eras. Admission is about $12 for adults; free for those under 18.
Price also includes admission into three other local museums. Stroll the
cobblestone Street of the Knights (Ippoton on the maps) to see medieval
inns that served as clubs and meeting places for the multinational
Knights of St. John; their facades mirror the architecture of the knights’
various countries of origin.
The famous Colossus of Rhodes was erected somewhere on Mandraki
Harbor. A depiction of the sun god Helios, and considered one of the
Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the bronze statue was reportedly
100 feet tall and straddled the harbor. Nothing remains of it today.
You can find plenty of places to stop for a bite in old town and new town,
including many worthwhile seafood restaurants.

many of which lie on the east coast. Faliaraki, about 20 minutes from
Rhodes Town, is one of the most popular.
If you want to visit Lindos, you should book a shore excursion (Lindos is
50 minutes away from Rhodes, and the excursion guarantees that you

get back in time), though be prepared for mucho crowds if you’re there
in July or August.
Santoríni
Santorini is one of the most breathtaking islands in the world, dotted
with whitewashed homes, black-pebble beaches, rich vineyards, and
ancient ruins. Approaching its volcanic cliffs by sea is a dramatic experi-
ence, with ships entering the caldera, a central crater formed during a
volcano eruption in 1500 B.C. Ash fell on the remaining land, burying the
ancient city of Akrotiri — an event that some believe may have sparked
the legend of Atlantis.
Fira, the capital, perches about 1,000 feet above sea level. Along its
winding streets, you find shops, cafes, and art galleries. Ia, about 10 
to 15 minutes away by cab, is a quiet and picturesque artist colony.
Cruising into port
The ship’s tender takes you to the port of Skala, where you have three
options to reach Fira: donkey, cable car, or foot.
Scoring the best excursions
Akrotiri Excavations and Fira Town: This tour takes you to Akrotiri, an
excavation site that dates back to the second millennium B.C. After the
tour, you have time to explore Fira and make your own way back to the
ship (three hours; $70).
Village of Oia and Winery: Walk on the picturesque narrow cobblestone
streets of the small village of Oia, perched on a cliff. Stop at a local winery
in a nearby village for a tasting. The tour ends in Fira (four hours; $65).
Exploring on your own
From Skala, the donkey and cable car rides to the top cost about $5 each
way — or you can walk up the 587 steps to the top, the same route the
donkeys take. Word to the wise: Donkeys are fed at the bottom of the
hill, so they tend to run down whether carrying someone or not. They
also smell a little funky. Donkey rides take about 20 to 30 minutes
depending on traffic and availability. Cable cars run every 20 minutes;
walking takes about 30 minutes (depending on the individual).
You can easily explore the town of Fira on foot, and you can take taxis
(not cheap and not always easy to find) or buses to other parts of the
island. If you hike regularly, you may want to try the 6.2-mile pedestrian
path from Fira to Ia that follows the edge of the caldera and offers stun-
ning views. Along the way, you pass several churches and climb two sub-
stantial hills.
Within walking distance: Fira offers shops and art galleries. If your
ship stays late enough in port, watch the sunset from a cafe for a classic
Greek Isles experience. The town is also full of great restaurants.

Beyond walking distance: Ia is quieter than Fira and offers charming
homes and galleries that showcase modern and folk art and traditional
handicrafts. To visit Ancient Akrotiri, located about 5 miles from Fira,
we recommend that you take a shore excursion with a guide to get
expert commentary.
Explore the excavation at Akrotiri in the morning because its enclosing
metal shed magnifies the afternoon heat.
Italy
If you ask ten people to name their favorite country in Europe, chances
are eight or nine of them are going to say Italy, a beautiful and diverse
country with an incredible cultural heritage. This is the land of Leonardo
and Michelangelo, of caesars and popes, of incredible architecture, gor-
geous scenery, wonderful pasta, and the latest fashions — not to men-
tion stylish and friendly people. You can see some of the ancient world’s

most famous ruins here (such as the Forum in Rome and the ancient
city of Pompeii), immerse yourself in the Renaissance in Florence, or
pole down the canals of Venice in a gondola. Or you can just sit in one of
those idyllic sidewalk cafes and live the European Dream. Un altro cap-
puccino, per favore?
Civitavecchia and Rome
The name Civitavecchia probably has you shaking your head wondering
Civita-who? But Civitavecchia has actually served as the port of Rome
since A.D. 108. Cruise ships shuttle passengers from here to Rome, about
90 minutes away. Rome, of course, is Italy’s largest city, where you find
incomparable sights such as the Vatican and the Forum, as well as other
cultural opportunities, diverse restaurants, and great shopping.
Cruising into port
Ships pull alongside the docks in Civitavecchia. When in Civitavecchia,
do as the Romans do: Go to Rome.
Scoring the best excursions
In addition to the following recommended excursion, most ships offer a
bus transfer, for $55 to $70, allowing you easy transportation to explore
Rome on your own. Some also offer the option of a half-day tour fol-
lowed by a half-day on your own for $75 to $92.
Rome City Tour: This comprehensive excursion includes a visit to the
Colosseum, St. Peter’s Basilica, the Vatican Museum, and the Sistine
Chapel. The driver also passes such landmarks as the Roman Forum,
Trajan’s Column, the Arch of Constantine, and the Circus Maximus. The
tour may also include a short walk to see Trevi Fountain and definitely
includes lunch and time to shop for souvenirs (ten hours; about $189).
Exploring on your own
From the pier, you can take a 15-minute walk or 5-minute cab ride into
the town of Civitavecchia. Taxis are usually available at the pier, and the
ride to Rome is about 90 minutes. You can also take a train, and the ride
takes about an hour (depending on the time of day, service is hourly or
twice hourly); Heidi’s done this and found it much more pleasant than a
long bus ride.
Within walking distance: We highly recommend taking a shore excur-
sion to Rome or going to Rome on your own because there’s just not
much to see in Civitavecchia.
Beyond walking distance: In Rome, Vatican City (www.vatican.va) is
the earthly locus of the Roman Catholic Church, centered on the huge
Basilica di San Pietro (St. Peter’s Basilica) and the enormous St. Peter’s
Square. Inside, treasures accumulated over the past two millennia testify
to the church’s wealth and temporal power. Admission is free to the

basilica; getting to the dome costs about $4 by stairs, $5 by elevator; and
guided tours of St. Peter’s Tomb (children under 15 aren’t admitted) are
about $10. During the summer, be prepared for lines.
Women visiting the Vatican must wear pants or skirts that cover their
knees. Men cannot wear shorts. No one is allowed to wear sleeveless tops.
American priests studying in Rome offer excellent, free tours of the
Basilica. The tours last about two hours and provide the architectural,
historical, and religious context for what you’re seeing. Inquire at the
Vatican Tourist Office (in the building to the left when you face the
Basilica).
Elsewhere in Vatican City, the Vatican Museum and the Sistine Chapel
are where the Vatican displays some of its most famous treasures. The
museum is massive, so you need to choose a route based on four color-
coded itineraries, which range from 11⁄2 to 5 hours. All four itineraries cul-
minate in the Sistine Chapel, where Michelangelo labored for four years
(1509–12) to paint the famous ceiling frescoes. Admission is about $15.
Bring binoculars to get a closer look at the Sistine Chapel’s ceiling.
Rome boasts so many other must-see sights that choosing among them
is hard, but try to catch a glimpse of the Roman Forum, the Colosseum,
and the Pantheon. A must-do stop for many is the Trevi Fountain, a
lavish Baroque creation; according to legend, if you toss in a coin, you’ll
return to Rome. (You may have to make your way through crowds to get
close enough to drop your money, however.) The famous Spanish Steps
take their name from the Spanish Embassy, which used to be headquar-
tered at the site. The steps are always packed with crowds of people
browsing the carts of the flower and jewelry vendors or just people-
watching. Shoppers also love the neighborhood, so check out the posh
shops on Via Borgognona and Via Condotti. For a less-expensive alter-
native, head to Via Sistina and Via Francesco Crispi.
Venice
Venice is in a category by itself. Rising straight out of the Gulf of Venice
and as beautiful as you could imagine, it’s an antique city of canals and
narrow streets, its doorways sheltering beautiful old homes, private gar-
dens, churches, and museums. Everywhere you look in this living museum
you see something artistic or otherwise fascinating, including amazing
numbers of Gothic and Renaissance structures; churches and palaces full
of paintings, statues, and frescoes; and construction projects aimed at
stopping buildings from sinking into the sea. Also sprinkled among the
antiquity are wonderful cafes, markets, and shops, with their archetypal
Murano glassware, designer clothes and sunglasses, and other items.
Even on a hot, crowded August day, the place is special, and you can 
still find a quiet, mysterious alleyway to explore, away from the hordes.
Getting lost exploring the city’s mazelike frenzy of canals, side streets,
and medieval bridges is practically an essential life-experience, but don’t
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
426

worry; you can’t get too lost because yellow signs everywhere point you
to major landmarks such as St. Mark’s Square and the Rialto Bridge.
Getting out on the Grand Canal, a watery version of a main city boule-
vard, is another must-do, whether you take the touristy route of paying for
a gondola (negotiate up front with the driver and expect to pay through
the nose) or an equally overpriced water taxi. You can also do like the
Venetians and ride a vaporetto (water bus). Any way you go, you pass 
historic buildings, ornate bridges, and waterfront palaces, and you share
the waterway with ambulance boats, delivery barges, and other vessels
reminding you that the canal is the byway for ordinary life in Venice, a city
that has neither cars nor streets wide enough to drive them on.
Cruising into port
Ships generally dock at terminals about 15 to 20 minutes by boat from
St. Mark’s Square, though some of the small ships, like the SeaDream
yachts, dock close to St. Mark’s Square at the very heart of Venice.
Scoring the best excursions
Venice City Sightseeing: Take a motor launch to St. Mark’s Square for a
guided walking tour of St. Mark’s Cathedral and a visit to Doge’s Palace,
the former residence of the Duke of Venice. The itinerary also includes
the Golden Staircase, where you can enjoy the views of St. Mark’s Basin.
You also cross the famous Bridge of Sighs and stop at the small work-
shops of glass manufacturers (31⁄2 hours; $75).
The Grand Canal and the Inside Canal: Travel by motorboat with a
guide to find out how the city works — the police, fire brigade, even
wedding and funeral processions travel by boat. From the water, you get
a wonderful view of St. Mark’s Square and other sights, including palaces
and the Guggenheim Museum. You also go under the famous Rialto
Bridge (21⁄2 hours; $105).
Evening Gondola Ride with Serenade: It may sound hokey, but we
think there’s something magical about exploring the canals of this
romantic city on these black pointy vessels, with a gondolier singing in
Italian (two hours; $114).
Exploring on your own
Assuming your ship isn’t docked right near St. Marks Square, you have
to take a boat to get to the heart of Venice. Your choices are taking the
ship’s arranged boats, a private water taxi (which is pricey), or a public
water bus called a vaporetto (which is cheap).
Within walking distance: Take a boat to St. Mark’s Square. From there,
you can walk to the rest of the attractions that we list here. The square
is the cultural hub of the city, and you can easily spend hours here sit-
ting with the fashionable in a cafe, visiting the Basilica and Doge’s
Palace, watching people feed the pigeons, and shopping. As a tourist
hub, however, the square gets very crowded during the day, particularly

in the summer high season. To avoid the crowds, go in the early morning
or in the evening if possible. If you’re staying on before or after your
cruise, drop in at night, when you may catch free musical performances
by chamber orchestras and other groups.
St. Mark’s Basilica, located on the square, is nicknamed the “Church of
Gold” and is one of the most elaborate churches in the world. You can
see the Basilica’s dome as your ship moves down the Grand Canal. The
Marciano Museum contains the Triumphal Quadriga — four famous
horse statues looted from Constantinople by Venetian crusaders in 1204.
Admission to the Basilica is free, treasury costs about $2.50, presbytery
$2, and Marciano Museum $2.
Men and women are banned from wearing shorts or exposing bare arms
or shoulders in the Basilica, and women may not wear skirts above the
knee. Silence is required, and no photos are allowed.
Near the famous Campanile di San Marco (bell tower of St. Marks) is
the Palazzo Ducale (Doge’s Palace), Italy’s grandest civic structure.
Admission is about $20 and also covers admission to the Square’s
Correr Civic Museum and its collection of paintings and artifacts.
You can shop right on the square and on the streets between the square
and the Rialto Bridge. A favorite shopping street is Salizzida San Moisé,
where you find designer shops such as Prada. Generally, the farther
away from St. Mark’s you go, the more reasonable the prices.
Farther away but still within walking distance is the Collezione Peggy
Guggenheim (www.guggenheim-venice.it), located in a waterfront
palazzo on the other side of the canal from St. Mark’s (you can cross at
the Ponte dell’ Accademia bridge, or get there by water taxi or water
bus). The impressive palazzo, which was art patron Mrs. Guggenheim’s
home, houses works by Pollock, Ernst, Picasso, Braque, Magritte,
Duchamp, Chagall, Mondrian, Brancusi, Dalí, Giacometti, Moore, and
others. Admission is about $13.
Near the Ponte dell’Accademia bridge is the Gallerie dell’Accademia
(www.gallerieaccademia.org), a museum where the glory of old
Venice lives on in a remarkable collection of paintings from the 14th to
the 18th centuries. Admission is about $8.25. Farther along the Grand
Canal, the graceful Rialto Bridge is another of Venice’s most famous
landmarks. Once the only bridge across the canal and a famous center of
business and trade, today it’s lined along its span by pricey boutiques.
Portugal
First off, we know that Portugal isn’t on the Mediterranean. Even so, the
country’s capital city, Lisbon, is the starting point for some itineraries
that head into the Med via the Straits of Gibraltar. It’s a cosmopolitan
city built on seven hills and boasting a pleasing combination of history,

Chapter 17: Meandering in the Mediterranean 431

culture, arts, modern amenities, and visual treats. Some areas may
remind some visitors of Paris (with street painters and the like), others
of hilly San Francisco, and still others — such as the old Moorish Alfama
section — of cities in Morocco. Lisbon is a walking city (although the
hills may prove challenging to some), and its sidewalks are particularly
beautiful, made from small black and white stones that are individually
shaped and set into an artful mosaic pattern. They can be slippery when
wet, but they’re worth that inconvenience.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships dock at the Port of Lisbon, about 15 minutes by car from
the city center.
Scoring the best excursions
Lisbon City Tour: Ride by bus around Lisbon to see a number of city
highlights, including Avenida da Liberdade, with its mosaic-lined side-
walks and the magnificent views of the River Tagus at Black Horse
Square. Tour the impressive Jerónimos Monastery. Also visit the
National Coach Museum or the Convent of Madre de Deus, founded in
1509, which contains samples of religious architecture (four hours; $46).
Sintra and Estoril: This tour along the famous and scenic Estoril coast
includes such memorable highlights as Sintra — a serene historic resort
nestled in the forested hills of Serra de Sintra and the summer residence
of kings and nobility. Continue inland to Queluz to tour the magnificent
18th-century palace built in the style of Versailles. Some tours also
include the well-known seaside resort of Cascais (four hours; $45).
Fatima and Batalha: Located 100 miles from Lisbon is the place known
to Roman Catholics as the “Lourdes of Portugal.” At Fatima, according to
legend, three young shepherds in 1917 claimed they saw the Virgin Mary
in an oak tree. Lunch is served at a local restaurant or hotel. The tour
continues on to Batalha for a visit to the impressive gothic church of
Santa Maria da Victoria (eight to nine hours; $118).
Exploring on your own
Taxis (usually diesel-engine Mercedes) are generally available outside
the terminal building to take you into the city center. The ride to the cen-
tral sightseeing and shopping districts should cost $10 to $12. Traffic
can be congested, so give yourself extra time. The city also has a good
bus and tram service, as well as a subway, to get around. A funicular
(elevator) connects the Baixa area, where you find shopping (between
the Rossio, which is the city’s main square, and the River Tagus), with
the Bairro Alto, where you find nightlife.
Within walking distance: You need to take a taxi to the Alfama, the
Belém area, and other sights.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
432

Beyond walking distance: Houses in the alleys of the old Alfama dis-
trict are so close together that you can’t stretch your arms fully in some
places. Visit the 12th-century Sé (cathedral), check out the goods at the
markets, and climb up to the Castelo São Jorge (St. George’s Castle) to
enjoy the views. The fortress predates the Romans, and the Moors
erected many of the walls that still stand. On the grounds, you may
encounter a swan or rare white peacock. Admission is free.
Belém, where the River Tagus meets the sea, is where Portuguese explor-
ers such as Magellan launched their missions. Belém Tower is a 16th-
century monument to Portugal’s age of discovery and its famous seafar-
ers. Admission is about $4. Nearby Jerónimos Monastery, built in 1502,
stands as a masterpiece of Manueline architecture. Admission to the
church is free; admission to the secluded monastery is about $4. The
Maritime Museum (www.museumarinha.pt), located in the Jerónimos
Monastery’s west wing, is one of the most important of its kind in Europe.
It contains hundreds of ship models, ranging from 15th-century sailing
ships to 20th-century warships. Admission is about $4.
Spain
Barcelona is one of the busiest cruise ports in the world. First developed
as a port by the Romans, Barcelona is renowned for its architecture,
which mixes ancient Roman ruins and buildings from the 13th and 15th
centuries with startlingly modern creations by Antoni Gaudí and I. M.
Pei. The city’s artistic history includes greats like Picasso, Miró, Dalí,
Tapiés, and Casals, and you can find great museums, friendly people,
pleasant cafes, a very active nightlife, and beautiful sandy beaches.
Cruising into port
Ships dock near the heart of Barcelona, and depending on exactly which
pier your ship uses, you may be as close as a five-minute walk from La
Rambla (the Rambles), which is the main artery for visitors. If your ship
is at one of the more distant piers, though, you may be a mile or more
away, in which case you can use the cruise line’s shuttle service or jump
in a cab.
Scoring the best excursions
City Highlights: This bus and walking tour includes the Gothic Quarter, a
stop at Montjuïc for the views, the Olympic Stadium, Gaudí’s La Sagrada
Familia, Les Ramblas, and Catalunya Square (31⁄2 hours; $37).
Picasso and Gaudí: This tour visits the Picasso Museum and its collec-
tion of paintings, drawings, engravings, and ceramics, then heads to Casa
Mila (also known as La Pedrera), an apartment building with an ornate,
undulating façade and iron art nouveau balconies (31⁄2 hours; $49).

Gaudí’s Barcelona: A bus tour taking in several Barcelona landmarks
designed by visionary architect Antonio Gaudí, including his Parc Güell,
a landscaped public park full of Gaudí architecture, tilework, and other
pieces); Sagrada Familia Cathedral, Barcelona’s most famous structure;
and the Casa Mila and Casa Batlló apartments (41⁄2 hours; $40).
Pilgrimage to Montserrat: Head 36 miles north of Barcelona to the
sacred Mountain of Montserrat, one of Spain’s natural wonders. About
halfway up the mountain, the Montserrat Monastery is famous for its
shrine of the Virgin Mary, Our Lady of Montserrat (41⁄2 hours; $40). Longer
tours include a bus tour of Barcelona and lunch (eight hours; $115).
Exploring on your own
Taxis are available outside the terminal. They’re metered and the fare
begins at about $3, plus about $1 per kilometer and an extra charge if
the taxi goes into the pier area. The city also has a good Metro and bus
system.
In summer, the Bus Turistic (www.tmb.net/en_US/turistes/bus
turistic/busturistic.jsp) passes a dozen of the most popular
sights, and you can get on and off as you please. The bus’s blue line
stops at the port, and tickets cost $23 (available on the bus or from
Barcelona’s tourist information centers).
Within walking distance: There’s a good chance you may be able to
hoof it from the docks to La Rambla and the Barri Gòtic, so we’re going
to consider that within walking distance — though if your ship docks at
one of the farther piers you may want to take a taxi or shuttle to get to
the base of La Rambla faster. Most sites are within walking distance for
those in decent shape, though some might want to take a taxi to spots
like La Sagrada Familia, which lies about two miles from the nearest
cruise dock.
Victor Hugo called La Rambla (the Rambles) “the most beautiful street
in the world.” A tree-lined boulevard, the street runs from Placa de
Catalunya to the sea and bustles with 24-hour street performers, flower
vendors, birds in cages, cafes, and shops. It can get very busy when sev-
eral ships are in port.
In the Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter), which spreads out just east of La
Rambla, you can wander for hours — getting lost is part of the fun. Stop
in at the Gothic Cathedral de Barcelona (admission to the church is free;
the museum costs about $1.25) and saunter the cobblestone streets past
fountains, vintage stores, and cafes. Less than a quarter mile from the
Cathedral, a series of medieval palaces now house the Museu Picasso
(www.museupicasso.bcn.es), which boasts an impressive collection of
the artist’s work. Pablo Picasso himself donated some 2,500 of his paint-
ings to the collection, including a piece he painted at the age of nine.
Admission is about $7.50.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
436

The fantastical architecture of Antoni Gaudí is the must-see cultural
attraction in Barcelona. Top of the list is La Sagrada Familia (Church of
the Holy Family; www.sagradafamilia.org), a truly bizarre architec-
tural wonder that’s been under construction since 1882. You can climb
the tall spires if you’re not claustrophobic and/or afraid of heights.
Admission is about $10.
At the northern end of La Rambla, cross the large Placa Catalunya to find
the Passeig de Gràcia, the main shopping street, which runs off to the
northwest as a sort of continuation of La Rambla. Gaudí’s famous undu-
lating Casa Mila (La Pedrera) apartment building is located on the
corner of the Passeig de Gràcia and Carrer de Provença. Admission is
about $9. The other major Gaudí site in town, the landscaping miracle
known as Parc Güell, is farther northwest on a hill above central
Barcelona, and is probably best visited on a tour or by taxi.
Turkey
Turkey is literally where East meets West (Istanbul sits where Europe
and Asia touch), and is the most exotic country commonly visited on
Mediterranean cruises — a land of mosques and minarets, sultans’ treas-
ures, crowded bazaars, Greek and Roman archaeological sites, and
Christian landmarks. Although its cities teem with the energy of a
modern nation looking to the West, its villages remain much as they’ve
been for hundreds of years.
Because of the wide fluctuation of Turkish currency, only exchange the
amount that you intend to spend. The rug shops and some other ven-
dors often deal in U.S. dollars.
Istanbul
The city where the continents of Asia and Europe meet is chaotic, con-
gested, fascinating, and exciting. Cars careen past grand mosques,
churches, museums, palaces, and other historic and living monuments
that reveal a rich and ancient history. Among the many treats for your
senses are the smells of a spice market, the sound of prayer, the taste of
traditional Turkish dishes, the feel of a Turkish carpet, and the treasures
left by rulers past.
Cruising into port
Ships drop anchor on the Bosporus (the strait between the Black Sea
and the Sea of Marmara) on the European side of the city. Coming and
going, the views of Old Istanbul are quite spectacular, with minarets and
domes piercing the skyline. Taxis are relatively inexpensive and wait at
the pier. You can also find plenty throughout the city.

Scoring the best excursions
Highlights of Istanbul: This tour typically includes the Hippodrome,
once the largest chariot race grounds of the Byzantine Empire; the
Sultan Ahmet Mosque, also known as the Blue Mosque for its 21,000
blue Iznik tiles; the famous St. Sophia, once the largest church of the
Christian world; and Topkapi Palace, the official residence of the
Ottoman Sultans and home to treasures that include Spoonmaker’s
Diamond, one of the biggest in the world. The tour also visits the Grand
Bazaar and its 4,000 shops. Some tours bring you back to the ship for
lunch and others include lunch in a first-class restaurant. You can also
take shorter tours that include some of the features of the full tour
(seven to ten hours; $90–$110).
Exploring on your own
It takes a healthy walk to get from the pier to the Blue Mosque. Your best
bet is to take the cruise line’s shuttle or a cab. The starting taxi fare is
about $1. When out an about, you can hail cabs on the street or pop into
any hotel and ask the desk to call one for you.
The best way to explore the old section of the city is on foot.

Within walking distance: After you’re dropped off, visit the Sultan
Ahmet Mosque (also known as the Blue Mosque), built in the 17th cen-
tury and featuring dazzling blue and white Iznik tiles and six minarets.
Guests must remove their shoes at the entrance. Admission is free. The
Hippodrome, a park right in front of the Blue Mosque, once hosted char-
iot races and gladiatorial contests attended by up to 100,000 fans. Nearby,
the Ayasofya (also known as Hagia Sophia) was completed in A.D. 537 and
stood as the largest Christian church in the world for almost a thousand
years, its dome so high that the Statue of Liberty’s torch would barely
graze the top. It’s been a mosque since 1453, when Sultan Mehmet II con-
quered the Byzantine Empire and took control of Istanbul. Historians
regard the mosque as one of the best examples of Byzantine architecture,
with its magnificent domes and mosaics. Admission is about $11.
From the 15th century to the mid-19th century, Topkapi Palace, on lands
adjacent to Ayasofya, served as the residence of sultans. The complex
includes the chamber of the Sacred Mantle, harem quarters, crown jewels,
holy relics, and the throne room. Admission is about $9; the guided harem
tour costs $7.50.
The Grand Bazaar is the world’s largest covered market, with more than
4,000 vendors selling carpets, leather goods, jewelry, antique reproduc-
tions, and other items. You can buy maps of the Bazaar at newsstands
for about $6. The setting is a trip in itself, even if you don’t buy anything.
If you do want to buy, make sure to try and bargain the merchant down.
It’s tradition. Your best bets among the entrances are the Beyazit Gate or
the Nuruosmaniye Gate.
Beyond walking distance: The Dolmabache Palace, on Dolmabache
Caddesi, is sometimes called the Ottoman Versailles. The extravagance
includes a four-ton Baccarat chandelier that was a gift from Queen
Victoria. Admission is about $7 for a long tour (including the Sultan’s
Quarters and Harem) or $6 for a short tour (of one room or the other).
You must pay a fee of $13 to use your video camera.
Kus¸dadasi
A favorite port for travelers interested in history, the once sleepy little vil-
lage of Ku@dadasi is now a bustling seaside resort. The reason? Its proxim-
ity to Ephesus, one of the most fascinating and best-preserved ancient
historical sites in the world, as well as other major early Christian and his-
torical locales. If the past isn’t your bag, you can stay in town and shop
(it’s a great place to buy Turkish rugs) or go to one of the excellent nearby
beaches for a swim.
Cruising into port
Ships dock right in downtown, so you can walk to stores and restaurants.

Scoring the best excursions
Ephesus: One of the world’s best-preserved ancient cities. Your guide
leads you down marble streets to the remains of the Baths, the theater,
and the incredible library building. Along the way, you pass columns,
mosaics, monuments, and ruins. The tour may include a stop at a rug
shop (three to four hours; $42–$48).
Ephesus, the Shrine of St. John, and the House of The Virgin Mary:
This tour combines a visit to Ephesus with trip to the Basilica of St. John
(built by the Emperor Justinian over the tomb of St. John the Apostle,

and now in ruins) and the House of the Virgin Mary, a humble chapel in
the valley of Bulbuldagi on the spot where historians believe the Virgin
Mary spent her last days (41⁄2 hours; $59).
Ruins Of Miletus & Didyma: This tour takes in the ruins of the region,
including Didyma, known for the Temple of Apollo, and Miletus, which
includes a stadium the Greeks built and the Romans expanded to hold
15,000 spectators. A buffet lunch is included (seven hours; $85).
Exploring on your own
Though you can do a little shopping or have lunch in town, it’s better to
sign up for one of your ship’s tours to Ephesus. Minibuses (available from
the town center) and taxis (yellow and metered) can get you to the beach.
Within walking distance: You can find plenty of places to shop and
haggle. Vendors generally bump up prices when cruise ships are in port,
and they expect you to bargain. Shopkeepers often offer you tea or soft
drinks as negotiations get underway as part of Turkish hospitality; accept-
ing their hospitality in no way obligates you to buy.
Beyond walking distance: Book a shore excursion to tour Ephesus or
the other historic sites to get the most out of your visit. Law requires
Turkish guides to be licensed, so you can expect guides who are quite
knowledgeable about their subject matter.
Kadinlar Denizi is Ku@dadasi’s most popular beach, located about 5 miles
from the port. Also known as Ladies Beach, the small stretch attracts a
large crowd, including macho posers and women who like to sunbathe
topless. Restaurants along the harbor specialize in the catch of the day.

cruise lines covered in chapters 11 to 13 sail in the regions covered in
this chapter, but you can also find niche and foreign lines sailing here
that may not have made our cruise-review chapters because they don’t
operate in any big way in the Caribbean, Alaska, or the Mediterranean. 
In these cases, we’ve included contact information here so you can get
more details.
The American South and Midwest
Mark Twain discovered America’s heartland while traveling down the
Mississippi River, which he described as “the great Mississippi, the
majestic, the magnificent Mississippi, rolling its mile-wide tide along,
shining in the sun.” You can explore the America that so enticed the
writer by traveling down the very same river and in the very same way
as Twain: aboard a real paddlewheel steamboat.

Majestic America (formerly Delta Queen; see Chapter 13), with its lovely
1927-built Delta Queen (a National Historic Landmark) and two newer
steamboats, is the big cheese is this region. The Mississippi River system
(www.nps.gov/miss) consists of some 50 rivers and tributaries, seven 
of which — the Atchafalaya, Arkansas, Ohio, Tennessee, Cumberland,
Missouri, and Illinois — are navigable for considerable distances. From
the rural plantation homes and stately mansions of the antebellum south
to the farmlands and Victorian-era homes of the region’s more northern
reaches, the experience is pure Americana. New Orleans is a principal
embarkation port, as are Memphis, Nashville, Cincinnati, and St. Louis.
RiverBarge Excursions (% 888-GO-BARGE; www.riverbarge.com)
also operates year-round 4- to 10-day river cruises on waterways includ-
ing the Mississippi, Cumberland, Ohio, and Missouri. The company’s one
vessel, the River Explorer, is actually a string of vessels: two hotel barges
propelled by a tugboat.
If you want to feel like you’re sailing the ocean without being on the
ocean, you can also cruise on the Great Lakes with American Canadian
Caribbean (see Chapter 13). The Great Lakes Cruise Company (% 888-
891-0203; www.greatlakescruising.com) charters small ships for
cruising the Great Lakes, and the Traverse Tall Ship Company (% 800-
678-0383; www.tallshipsailing.com), based in Traverse City, Michigan,
offers sailings on Lake Michigan and Lake Huron aboard Windjammer sail-
ing ships.
On the east coast, Connecticut-based American Cruise Lines (% 800-
814-6880; www.americancruiselines.com) operates small ships on
weeklong itineraries that include Chesapeake Bay, the St. Johns and
Tolomato rivers in Florida, and the Intracoastal Waterway.
The Columbia and Snake Rivers
History buff? Always wanted to trek the route of Lewis and Clark? You’re
in luck: Several cruise lines follow the explorers’ route along the Columbia
and Snake Rivers in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The second-largest river 
in the United States (after the Mississippi), the Columbia River winds
between the Cascade Mountains and past the Columbia River Gorge’s
waterfalls and lush forests. Cruises depart from Portland and follow the
Columbia River east between Oregon and Washington, sometimes going
as far east as Idaho. Visits can include Bonneville Dam, Hood River (the
windsurfing capital of the world), Hell’s Canyon, and the historic towns 
of the Oregon Trail.
Majestic America Line offers cruises that depart from Portland year-
round. Cruise West, Lindblad Expeditions, and American Safari also offer
small-ship Columbia and Snake River cruises in the spring and fall. See
Chapter 13 for more on all these lines.
Chapter 18: Exploring Other Destinations 443

New England and Canada
If you’re looking for a slow, easy meander visiting quaint, often un-touristy
towns, book a cruise along the coast of New England and eastern Canada.
The folksy vibe and the striking natural beauty of the northeastern
Atlantic coast are already appealing in summer, but for the ultimate you
should book during a fall-foliage cruise, when New England turns into a
painter’s palette of Autumn colors. Attractions on these 7- to 14-day
cruises typically include stops in Boston, with its historic Freedom Trail;
Newport, Rhode Island, with its gorgeous mansions; Bar Harbor, Maine,
with its splendid hiking trails and scenic vistas; the trendy and pictur-
esque island of Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts; the Canadian coastal
provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland; and Quebec
City or Montreal, two historic cities in bilingual Quebec. Shorter cruises
out of New York City may make just a stop or two in the Canadian
provinces.
Cruises generally depart from New York or Boston and travel northward,
but you can also board in Montreal or Quebec City and sail south.
American Canadian Caribbean, Carnival, Celebrity, Crystal, Cunard,
Holland America, Norwegian, Princess, Regent Seven Seas, Royal
Caribbean, Seabourn, and Silversea all typically offer New England itiner-
aries, as does Connecticut-based American Cruise Lines (% 800-814-
6880; www.americancruiselines.com). The Maine Windjammer
Association offers rustic cruises that concentrate on mid-coast Maine.
Look for more detail on all these lines in Chapters 11 through 13.
Bermuda
Cruises to Bermuda, that neat and tidy British colony in the Atlantic
Ocean, usually combine several relaxing days at sea with several relax-
ing days on the island. You can spend your island time exploring by the
preferred and fabulously fun means of transport — mopeds or scooters
(rental cars are banned here) — and enjoy activities such as golf, sun-
bathing on the island’s famous pink-sand shores, snorkeling, scuba
diving, joining glass-bottom boat tours, visiting museums and historic
homes, watching Bermudian businessmen in their shorts and sports
jackets, and savoring very proper High Tea.
Bermuda’s ports of call are Hamilton, King’s Wharf, and St. George’s.
Celebrity, Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, Costa, and Princess all have
ships that sail Bermuda routes regularly from late April to October, 
with most of the cruises departing from New York, New Jersey, Boston,
Philadelphia, Norfolk, VA. We offer more detail on all these cruise lines 
in Chapters 11 through 13.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
444

Costa Rica
Most cruises to lush, green Costa Rica explore this Central American
country’s natural wonders, offering tours of beaches, rain forests, and
mountains. Highlights include the indigenous plant and animal life,
including thousands of varieties of butterflies. In addition to the numer-
ous national parks, you can visit historic sites and ruins.
Costa Rican ports of call include Bahia Herradura, Cano Island, Corcovado
National Park, Curu, Golfito, Golfo Dulce, Manuel Antonio Park, Marenco
Reserve, Playa Flamingo, Puerto Caldera, Puerto Limón, Puntarenas,
Quepos, and Tortuga.
Cruise West operates 7-day cruises in Costa Rica nearly year-round, and
also offers longer sailings that combine Costa Rica with a trip through
the Panama Canal (see the next section). Lindblad Expeditions operates
7-day Costa Rican and Panama Canal cruises in the winter, summer, and
fall. And Windstar Cruises offers cruises from the country November
through March. See Chapter 13 for info on all three lines.
Most of the mainstream and luxury lines have cruises that include Costa
Rica as a port of call, often on Panama Canal itineraries.
The Panama Canal
Ships pass through this eighth wonder of the world as part of one-way
repositioning cruises in the late fall and early spring. Some lines also
include the Panama Canal as part of longer Caribbean, Central American,
and South American itineraries in the winter.
The reasons are both practical and scenic. If they didn’t go through,
ships would have to take the long way around Cape Horn, at the tip of
South America — an 8,000 nautical mile voyage from, say, New York to
San Francisco. Traversing the 50-mile canal, on the other hand, takes
just eight hours and provides a unique and fascinating experience as the
water level lifts and lowers your ship 85 feet through a series of locks,
gates, and dams.
Panama Canal cruises can include stops at Central American ports such
as Cartagena, Colombia; Puerto Caldera, Puerto Limón, and Puntarenas
(all in Costa Rica); and Panama’s San Blas Islands, home of the Kuna
Indians, known for their colorful needlework. Itineraries often last 10
days or more, and may also include Caribbean or Mexican Riviera stops.
Nearly every line spends some time in the Canal, including Celebrity,
HAL, NCL, Oceania, Princess, Royal Caribbean, Crystal, Regent, Seabourn,
Silversea, and Windstar. Cruise West and Lindblad also have ships in the
region for at least part of each year. See chapters 11 through 13 for more
on these lines.
Chapter 18: Exploring Other Destinations 445

The Mexican Riviera
The so-called Mexican Riviera — the stretch of port cities and resorts
extending from Mazatlán in the north to Acapulco in the south — is the
Caribbean of the west coast, offering gorgeous beaches, perfect weather,
beautiful scenery, and a good helping of rich Mexican culture. The glori-
ous beaches are the main attraction, along with the accessibility of golf,
tennis, deep-sea fishing, and water sports. Seven-day cruises leave year-
round from Los Angeles, Long Beach, and San Diego, visiting ports such
as Cabo San Lucas (a partying town and beach heaven at the southern
tip of the Baja Peninsula) and the mainland cities of Mazatlán and Puerto
Vallarta, both of which combine beach resorts with historical and cul-
tural sites. Shorter 3- or 4-night cruises call at Catalina Island and
Ensenada, both in Baja, while longer cruises usually include a stop in
Acapulco, erstwhile jet-setter hot-spot. Some lines also visit the region
as part of longer itineraries that include the Panama Canal.
Carnival, Celebrity, Holland America, Norwegian, Princess, and Royal
Caribbean all sail in the area (see Chapter 11). Luxe lines Crystal and
Silversea also offer occasional sailings (see Chapter 12).
Baja and the Sea of Cortez
Many small ships sail this region, which is sometimes referred to as
Mexico’s Galapagos for its rugged, arid scenery and its remarkable
wildlife, which includes gray whales in winter. Cruises typically mix
visits to the region’s cities and towns with stops at protected islands in
the Sea of Cortez. One day you’re in Cabo San Lucas, with its great beach
scene and touristy (but fun!) bars, and the next you’re walking along the
shore of an uninhabited island, with no trace of human civilization in
sight. Whale- and wildlife-watching are major attractions, and you can
also hike, kayak, snorkel, go tidepooling, and swim from beautiful, iso-
lated beaches.
Small-ship lines American Safari Cruises, Cruise West, and Lindblad
Expeditions (see Chapter 13) all offer cruises that concentrate exclu-
sively on the peninsula and Sea of Cortez, off its eastern coast. Many
mainstream lines stop at Cabo San Lucas as part of Mexican Riviera 
itineraries.
The Hawaiian Islands
Oh, right, Hawaii. That’s another word for paradise, right? Pretty much.
It’s got rugged coastlines, majestic volcanoes (some still active and
spewing lava), dramatic waterfalls, lush forests, abundant orchids and
other tropical flowers, and magnificent beaches — plus gorgeous hula
girls, hunky Polynesian men, and perfect weather. The combination puts
both locals and visitors in a friendly, mellow mood.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
446

Cruising around the Hawaiian Islands gives you the chance to experience
Hawaiian culture and food at a traditional luau, explore sacred Hawaiian
sites on land, visit the USS Arizona memorial at Pearl Harbor, snorkel or
scuba around underwater reefs, golf on picture-perfect courses, hike
around a volcano’s crater, go bird-watching, find out how to surf, or just
hang on the beach and be, you know, mellow.
There’s an interesting caveat to sailing in Hawaii, though: The itineraries
are often wacky. See, U.S. law prohibits ships not built, registered, and
staffed in the United States from sailing itineraries that only visit U.S.
ports. That means foreign-flagged ships can’t sail directly to Hawaii from
the contiguous 48 states, or even sail within the islands themselves
unless they also make a stop in another country. These rules make it
really, really difficult for most cruise lines to sail here, since nearly every-
one builds, registers, and staffs their ships abroad to keep costs down.
Some ships sail to the islands from Mexican ports such as Ensenada.
Others sail round-trip from Honolulu but make a looong detour to one of
the Polynesian nations in the middle of the cruise, while still others visit
only in April/May and September/October, on their way between seasons
in Alaska and the Caribbean.
The exception to these crazy itineraries is Norwegian Cruise Line
(NCL), which in 2003 agreed to play by most of the rules in exchange for
a little government flexibility on others. A special Congressional provi-
sion allowed NCL to build two ships in Germany, using steel and parts
originally made in the U.S., and to reflag an existing foreign-built ship,
creating a three-ship Hawaii fleet that can sail round-trip from Honolulu.
NCL’s part of the bargain was that, for the first time in decades, it would
register its ships in the U.S., pay U.S. taxes, hire an all-American crew,
and abide by U.S. laws. The line now owns the Hawaii cruise market,
offering inter-island cruises year-round. A fourth NCL ship offers longer
cruises that also visit Fanning Island in the Kiribati Republic.
Other lines, including Carnival, Celebrity, Holland America, Princess, and
Royal Caribbean, offer a limited number of Hawaii cruises at different
points of the year. See Chapter 11 for more about these lines.
Tahiti and the South Pacific
Cruising here is like spending a week in paradise — and we don’t mean
some kind of phony “Calgon, take me away” kind of paradise either. No,
we mean the kind where the weather is always perfect, the beaches are
always clean and uncrowded, and the water is always crystal blue. Up
above, volcanic peaks poke holes in perfect blue skies, while down
below, scuba divers and snorkelers swim among thousands of species of
fish and even humpback whales. If you’re not into water activities, you
can find plenty to do at visits to ports such as Huahine, Moorea, Raiatea,
and Bora Bora.
Chapter 18: Exploring Other Destinations 447

Regent Seven Seas has its chartered ship Paul Gauguin in Tahiti year-
round, at least through the end of 2008. Ditto for Princess and its small,
654-passenger Tahitian Princess. These cruises sail from Papeete, on the
island of Tahiti. Holland America and Celebrity also occasionally offers
Tahiti sailings, and small-ship lines Lindblad Expeditions, Cruise West,
and INTRAV/Clipper Cruise Lines offer several South Pacific itineraries
every year. Other lines, particularly luxury lines, sometimes visit as part
of world cruises and other long itineraries. See Chapters 11 through 13
for info on these lines.
Australia and New Zealand
Heading down under puts you in touch with some awesome natural
scenery, from coral reefs to glaciers, snow-capped mountains, fjords, 
fertile farmland and dry-as-a-bone desert. Thriving modern cities like
Sydney, Melbourne and Auckland hold their own in the dining and cul-
ture departments, and both countries produce some mighty good wine,
not to mention a rip-roaring fun pub scene. Perhaps the best part, though,
are those friendly locals with their great accents.
Itineraries are typically about two weeks and usually sail between
Sydney and Auckland (though some longer routes also include ports 
in Polynesia, Hawaii, or the Far East). In New Zealand, most ships 
stick to circumnavigating the South Island, where ports may include
Christchurch (a perfect little English town) and Wellington (around
which much of The Lord of the Rings trilogy was filmed). The main cruise
season is November to April, and Celebrity, Holland America, Princess,
and small-ship line INTRAV/Clipper Cruise Line (formerly Clipper Cruise
Line) all offer cruises in the region, and other lines (mostly luxury lines)
sometimes visit as part of world cruises. See Chapters 11 through 13 for
info on all these lines.
The British Isles and Northern Capitals
A number of ships sail from England, either focusing entirely on ports in
England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, or linking some of those ports
with visits to the capitals of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark,
and Germany. Cruise passengers get the city life of London and Dublin,
the golf of Scotland, the natural beauty of the coasts, and the charm of
the Channel Islands. The main season is April through October, with
most ships sailing from Southampton or Dover.
Celebrity, Princess, Oceania, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, Regent Seven
Seas, Seabourn, and Silversea offer cruises from and around the British
Isles, as do small-ship lines Lindblad and INTRAV/Clipper Cruise Line.
Cunard’s fabled QE2 is based in Southampton for most of the year, offer-
ing cruises in the isles and the Continent. You can find more detail on
each of these lines in Chapters 11 through 13.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
448

The Baltic and Scandinavia
We never met a fjord we didn’t like, so how can we not like Norway (not
to mention Denmark and Sweden, the other two Scandinavian nations
visited regularly by cruise ships)? Cruises lasting one to three weeks
typically depart from Southampton, Amsterdam, and Stockholm. Some
sail up the Norwegian coast with its never-ending string of deep fjords,
small fishing villages, and medieval cathedrals. Some even sail up above
the Arctic Circle into the land of the midnight sun. Most northern
Europe cruises, though, make a circuit through the Baltic Sea, visiting
Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, and St. Petersburg.
Pretty much every cruise line offers some itineraries in northern Europe,
including Celebrity, First Choice, Costa, Crystal, Cunard, First Choice,
Holland America, Lindblad, MSC, NCL, Oceania, Princess, Regent Seven
Seas, Royal Caribbean, Seabourn, and Silversea (we cover them all in
Chapters 11 through 13). The main cruise season is May to September.
Norwegian Coastal Voyage (% 800-323-7436; www.coastalvoyage.com)
also operates a fleet of working ships along the Norwegian coast year-
round, bringing passengers and cargo up and down the Norwegian coast,
with dozens of stops along the way.
European River and Canal Cruises
Cruising on Europe’s rivers and canals gets you inland without having to
take bus tours or car treks, and gives you a close-up view of the coun-
tries you visit. The pace is leisurely and the ambience informal — like
booking a B&B or country inn that just happens to float.
River cruises are offered aboard 100- to 200-passenger vessels that sail
the Danube, Rhine, Rhone, Moselle, Elbe, Seine, and other rivers in
Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, Holland, France, Austria, the Czech
Republic, and sometimes Russia. Canal cruises are available on intimate
barges that usually carry between 6 and 24 passengers, sailing the back
waterways of France, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and so on.
The season runs from mid-March through early November.
Top operators include Abercrombie & Kent (% 800-554-7016; www.
abercrombiekent.com); The Barge Lady (% 800-880-0071; www.barge
lady.com); French Country Waterways (% 800-222-1236; www.fcwl.

com); Uniworld (% 800-733-7820; www.uniworld.com); and Viking River
Cruises (% 877-668-4546; www.vikingrivercruises.com).
Southeast Asia
To really shrug off them been-there-done-that travel blues, head to
Southeast Asia. Vibrant and alive, Asia grabs on to your senses and
takes them for a ride. Nowhere is the contrast between old and new
Chapter 18: Exploring Other Destinations 449

more vivid. Everywhere you turn is some intricately carved temple
dating back 1,000 years sitting right next to a towering new office build-
ing. Bicycle rickshaws and rickety buses share narrow streets with
chauffer-driven cars.
Roughly stretching from India, east to China and Japan, and south to the
Indonesian Archipelago, Southeast Asia is a vast region. Optional pre- and
post-cruise land packages take you further inland to famed places like the
Taj Mahal, the Great Wall of China, and Angkor Wat, the ancient city of
temples in central Cambodia. Itineraries vary, but most are one to three
weeks long and depart from Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok or Tianjin/
Beijing, and may include ports in China (Hong Kong, Shanghai, Canton,
Tianjin/Beijing); Indonesia (Bali, Sumatra, Java, Lombok, Sulawesi); Japan
(Yokohama/Tokyo, Kobe, Osaka/Kyoto, Hiroshima, Nagasaki); Malaysia
(Penang, Port Kelang/Kuala Lumpur, Sarawak, Sabah); Vietnam (Ho Chi
Minh City, Haiphong/Hanoi, Nha Trang); Thailand (Bangkok, Phuket, Ko
Sumai); and India (Mumbai, Chennai, and Cochin).
Costa, Cruise West, Crystal, Cunard, Holland America, INTRAV/Clipper,
Oceania, Princess, Regent Seven Seas, Seabourn, Silversea and Star
Clippers all offer cruises in the region (and we cover them all in Chapters
11 through 13). Although the main cruise season is October to May, Star
Cruises (% 65-6223-0002 in Singapore; www.starcruises.com) has
ships based in the region year-round on mostly 1- to 7-night itineraries.
Antarctica
Got a hankering to head to the bottom of the earth? Got a hankering to
see waddling penguins, towering icebergs, giant albatrosses, and more
seals than you can count? A tour of the Great White Continent may be
for you, visiting scientific research stations and islands reachable only
by small landing craft.
Most Antarctica cruises depart from Ushuaia, Argentina, although some
sail from ports in Chile or from Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands. The
cruise season is January and February, and the offerings mostly range
from 8 to 15 nights.
Adventure cruise pioneer Lars-Eric Lindblad was the first to bring travel-
ers to the southern end of the world, and the company his son founded,
Lindblad Expeditions (see Chapter 13), maintains a big presence here,
frequently visiting Lindblad Cove, named for Lars-Eric in honor of his
achievements. Upscale tour operator Abercrombie & Kent (% 800-
554-7016; www.abercrombiekent.com), extreme adventure operator
Quark Expeditions (% 800-356-5699; www.quarkexpeditions.com),
Norwegian Coastal Voyage (% 800-323-7436; www.coastalvoyage.
com), and Orient Lines (% 800-333-7300; www.orientlines.com) all
cruise here as well, as do First Choice Expedition Cruising, Holland
America, Princess, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises (see Chapters 11
through 13).

Ten Things to Do When
Your Cruise Ends
In This Chapter
 Leaving your tips
 Checking your gear
 Getting through Customs
 Departing the pier
F
ace facts: It’s over. Your vacation is kaput. Done. Finished. History.
You have to go back to work tomorrow. Yes, you. And don’t give us
that sad face, either, ’cause we have to be back at our desks at 9 a.m.
too, writing this book.
Before you leave the ship, there are a few things you have to get settled.
In this chapter, we walk you through them, and try to make the whole
process as painless as possible.
Settling Your Bill
On the last night of your cruise, an itemized account of all you’ve
charged up to that point will be left in your cabin. Look it over. If you
agree with the charges, they are automatically billed to the credit card
you registered at the start of your cruise. If you’d rather pay in cash or
with a different card — or if you dispute any of the charges — you need
to stop by the reception desk and hash it out with the purser’s staff.
Leaving Your Tips
Most cruise lines pay their service staff low base wages with the under-
standing that the bulk of their income will come from tips. In the old
days, the last hours of a cruise were a flurry of little white envelopes, as
passengers slipped cash to their cabin steward, waiter, assistant waiter,
and sometimes maitre d’ and favorite bartender.

That’s still the way of it on some lines, but these days a lot of others
(Carnival, Costa, NCL, Oceania, Holland America, and Princess, to be
exact) are automatically adding tips to passengers’ onboard accounts,
with the amount adjustable up or down if you request it at the purser’s
desk before the end of the cruise. The base amount varies by cruise line,
but expect to pay between $8.50 and $12 per person, per day.
Some lines, such as Royal Caribbean and Disney, give you the option of
paying cash directly to staff or adding the gratuities onto your account.
Most small-ship lines pool the tips and divide them up among all
crewmembers after you’re gone.
And then there are the real ultraluxury lines, such as Silversea, Seabourn,
SeaDream, and Regent, where tips are included in your up-front cost.
Windstar promotes its “tipping not required” policy, but “required” is
the operative word: Tipping really is expected.
Each line has clear tipping guidelines, which you can usually research
ahead of time via the line’s brochures, Web sites, or cruise documents,
or aboard ship in the daily program for the last day and/or at the
debarkation briefing.
On lines that follow traditional person-to-person gratuity policies, tip
your waiter and assistant waiter during the cruise’s final dinner, and
leave your cabin steward his tip on the final night or morning, just
before you debark. Generally, expect to tip between $9 and $13 total per
passenger, per day (half that for kids). We usually divide it up as $3.50
per day for the cabin steward, $3.50 for the dining room waiter, and
about $2 for the assistant waiter. Some lines suggest you tip the maitre
d’ about $5 per person for the week and slip another couple bucks to the
chief housekeeper, but that’s up to you. Guests staying in suites with
butler service should slip the gent $3.50 per day. A 15 percent gratuity 
is usually included on every bar bill, so you don’t have to tip your bar-
tender with every drink. (The exception is on NCL’s Hawaii ships, where
tips aren’t included in the drink prices.)
Packing Up
A day or two before the end of the cruise, you receive color-coded or
numbered luggage tags based on your cabin category and flight time.
These determine the order in which you debark ship on the last day.
Attach them to any bags you want the ship’s staff to carry off for you.
Plan to pack your bags before dinner on your final night aboard. You are
asked to leave your luggage outside your cabin door by midnight or
thereafter so that staff can carry it all to a central offloading location.
First-time cruisers always worry about leaving their bags out in public,
but we’ve never heard an instance of anything being stolen.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
454

Especially on megaships, where ship staff collect and offload upwards 
of 5,000 or 6,000 pieces of luggage in just a few hours, don’t expect that
your luggage will be treated gently. If you’ve bought anything breakable
on your trip, carry it off the ship yourself rather than packing it in your
checked luggage.
Debarking, Whether You Want to or Not
Big ships typically offload passengers based on a color or number code
that matches the one on your luggage tags. Ships normally arrive in port
on the final day before 8 a.m., but usually need at least 90 minutes to
complete docking formalities, get cleared by authorities, and unload
baggage. No one debarks much before 9 a.m., and even then you may
have to wait a while before your color code is called. Passengers with
early flights and passengers who’ve paid the most (suite passengers, for
example) are typically allowed off first.
So they have time to clean up before the next group of passengers
arrive, cruise lines usually ask that you vacate your cabin early, have
breakfast, and wait in a lounge for your color or number to be called. If
your hand luggage is heavy or unwieldy, though, you can leave it in your
cabin and go back for it before you debark.
If you’re sailing on a small or very high-end ship, you can usually just get
off when the captain gives the all-clear.
Once you debark, your bags are waiting for you in the terminal, organ-
ized by the colored or numbered tags you attached. Attendants are
standing by to help you if you can’t find your bags.
Understanding Immigration (We Wish)
Since U.S. passport requirements were about to change as this book was
being prepared (requiring passports for all travel to Canada, Mexico,
Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Bermuda), it’s almost
certain that you’ll have to pass through Immigration and have your
passport stamped as you leave the ship. Non-U.S. citizens and green
card holders also have to see an Immigration official. Your ship will give
you details about the where and when.
Getting Through Customs
If you take a cruise that sails from the U.S. and visits foreign ports (in the
Caribbean, Canada, Central America, Mexico, or the Bahamas, for exam-
ple), you receive a Customs declaration form the last night of your sailing.
Fill it out so that you can present it to a Customs officer at the pier when
you arrive back in the U.S. If you get off the ship in another country, you
Chapter 19: Ten Things to Do When Your Cruise Ends 455

clear Customs at the airport when you get back to the United States.
Although inspectors don’t check each and every bag that comes back into
the country, you don’t want to get caught breaking the rules. Customs
applies stiff fines for doing so.
Read your Customs form thoroughly. Make sure that you fill in the
spaces correctly (if you mess up, ask for another form). You need to fill
out only one form per family. You must declare all items you acquired
abroad and are bringing back into the U.S., including purchases (for
yourself and/or others), gifts, and duty-free items. On your Customs
form, state the total price you paid for all items, including tax.
All Americans returning from abroad get a duty-free exemption, also
called a personal exemption. That’s the total value of merchandise you
may bring back to the States without having to pay duty — otherwise
known as tax. You can bring back more than your exemption, but if you
do, you pay the taxes on it.
When you see the term duty free at all those shops in the Caribbean,
Europe, and elsewhere, it doesn’t mean you won’t pay tax on it ever; it
just means you won’t pay tax when you buy it. Duty-free items do count
toward your personal exemption.
The standard personal duty-free allowance for U.S. citizens is $800, an
amount that applies to Mexico, Canada, and most of the Caribbean
islands. There are also limits on the amount of alcoholic beverages (usu-
ally 1 liter), cigarettes (1 carton), cigars (100 total, and no Cubans!), and
other tobacco products you may include in your personal duty-free
exemption. If returning directly from the U.S. Virgin Islands, you may
bring in $1,600 worth of merchandise duty-free, including 5 liters of alco-
hol, of which at least 1 liter should be a product of those islands.
As you may be visiting both foreign and U.S.-territory ports, things get
more complicated: If, for instance, your cruise stops in the U.S. Virgin
Islands and The Bahamas, your total limit is $1,600, of which no more
than $800 can be from The Bahamas. Note that you must declare on your
Customs form all gifts received during your cruise.
Confused yet?
Joint Customs declarations are also possible for family members travel-
ing together. For instance, for a husband and wife with two children, the
total duty-free exemption from most destinations would be $3,200.
For more specifics, visit the U.S. Customs Service Web site at www.
customs.gov. Canadian citizens should look at the Canada Border
Services Agency site (www.cbsa.gc.ca), and citizens of the U.K. should
visit the U.K. Customs and Excise site (www.hmce.gov.uk).
If you go over your exemptions (dollar-wise and amount of liquor and cig-
arettes wise), the next $1,000 worth of goods bought in most countries
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
456

will be taxed at a flat rate of 3 percent (1.5 percent for U.S. insular posses-
sions). Above that, the Customs officer will levy duties at whatever duty
rates apply. That sounds vague, right? Well it is (for us) and isn’t (for the
government). See, under what’s known as its “301” authority, the U.S.
Trade Representative is authorized to impose different duty rates for dif-
ferent items from different countries — sometimes up to 100 percent of an
item’s value. Most of these items aren’t things travelers would be bringing
back with them, but some are: diamonds from the Ukraine, for example.
You can pay in cash (U.S. dollars only), by personal check, or, at most air-
ports, by MasterCard or Visa.
Knowing What’s Prohibited or Restricted
When you read all the rules, you discover how complex this whole
Customs business is. The following list includes some things you can’t
bring back into the United States:
 Cuban cigars
 Meat and many other food products, including fruits or vegetables
you snagged from the buffet that morning. Bakery items and all
cured cheeses are generally admissible, as are most condiments,
vinegars, oils, packaged spices, honey, coffee, and tea.
 Live animals
 Some wildlife products, including elephant ivory, sea turtle prod-
ucts, coral (including all that black coral jewelry you see in the
Caribbean), crocodile or caiman leather, feathers and feather prod-
ucts from wild birds, fur from spotted cats, and other less common
items.
 Plants and seeds
 Bootleg and pirated goods (though you’re allowed to import one
copy each of any pirated work or object, as long as it’s for your per-
sonal use)
 Illegal drugs and medicines with a high potential for abuse
For restrictions for Canadian or U.K. citizens, check the appropriate Web
site (listed in the preceding section).
Taking Back Value-Added Tax 
and Goods-and-Services Tax
As if dealing with Customs restrictions isn’t confusing enough, other
countries have tax oddities that may actually get you some money back.
Chapter 19: Ten Things to Do When Your Cruise Ends 457

European countries, for example, levy a tax called the value-added tax
(VAT) on all items. Unlike American taxes, it’s already included in the
price of the item. The tax ranges from 15 to 35 percent (varying by coun-
try), but you may be able to get it refunded if you spend a designated
amount (normally between $50 and $200) in a single store.
By far the easiest way to get your money back is to go through the store’s
refund affiliate, which you can identify by a decal in the store window. 
The biggest of these services is Global Refund, which has its “Tax Free
Shopping” sticker in more than 225,000 stores in 35 countries. Using them
as an example, all you do is shop where you see their sign; ask for your
Global Refund Cheque; when leaving the country (let’s say at the airport),
show your purchases, receipts, and passport to Customs officials and
have your cheques export validated; then collect your refund in cash at
the airport’s Global Refund Office or send the cheques to the company to
get your money back.
A number of other companies operate the same way, with their own net-
works of retail outlets and airport offices.
Be aware that an administrative fee is deducted from your refund.
In Canada, a goods and services tax (GST) of 6 percent applies to most
goods and services sold in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario,
Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories,
Nunavut, and the Yukon. A harmonized sales tax (HST) of 14 percent is
applied to the same goods and services as the GST in New Brunswick,
Newfoundland, Labrador, and Nova Scotia. Non-resident visitors can claim
a refund for accommodation and goods as long as each item is worth
more than C$50 and the total is at least C$200 (before taxes). Keep your
receipts and pick up a Tax Refund Application for Visitors at any Customs
office or at most visitor centers, duty-free shops, department stores, and
some hotels. Also, keep your airline boarding passes, which you may have
to mail in with the form. If you leave the country by plane, car, or motor
coach, you have to show your goods at the border (or airport) and get
your receipts validated, or you can’t get a refund. You can find more infor-
mation on Canadian tax refunds at www.cra-arc.gc.ca.
Dealing with Departure Tax
Something to remember if your cruise ends in a foreign country from
which you plan to fly home: Some countries levy a departure tax on
everyone who leaves. It normally, but not always, costs you less than
$20. So don’t spend every penny you have before you get to the airport.
The airline can tell you the exact tax amount in advance.
