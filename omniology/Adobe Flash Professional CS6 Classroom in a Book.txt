Adobe FlAsh ProFessionAl Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 1
Adobe Flash Professional CS6 provides a comprehensive authoring environment 
for creating interactive and media-rich applications. Flash is widely used to cre-
ate engaging projects integrating video, sound, graphics, and animation. You can 
create original content in Flash or import assets from other Adobe applications 
such as Photoshop or Illustrator, quickly design animation and multimedia, and 
use Adobe ActionScript 3.0 to integrate sophisticated interactivity.
Use Flash to build innovative and immersive Web sites, to create stand-alone 
applications for the desktop, or to create apps to distribute to mobile devices 
running on the Android or the iOS system.
With extensive controls for animation, intuitive and flexible drawing tools, 
and a powerful object-oriented coding language, Flash delivers one of the only 
robust environments that let your imagination become reality. 
About Classroom in a Book
Adobe Flash Professional CS6 Classroom in a Book is part of the official train-
ing series for Adobe graphics and publishing software developed with the 
support of Adobe product experts. The lessons are designed so you can learn 
at your own pace. If you’re new to Flash, you’ll learn the fundamental concepts 
and features you’ll need to use the program. Classroom in a Book also teaches 
many advanced features, including tips and techniques for using the latest  
version of this application.

• Outputting animations as a Sprite sheet or PNG sequences to support 
alternative approaches to animation.
• A new feature for inverse kinematics called Pinning, which allows finer control 
for armatures.
• A tab ruler for TLF text for positioning of text with layout precision.
• An improved Code Snippets panel featuring a fast, visual way of applying code 
to objects on the Stage.
• Additional code snippets available in the Code Snippets panel, many geared 
particularly toward mobile device interactions.
• A streamlined Publish Settings dialog box.
• Better workflow for sharing resources across multiple FLA files
• Revamped interface for Adobe Media Encoder for more efficient processing of 
your media files.

Copying the Lesson Files
The lessons in Adobe Flash Professional CS6 Classroom in a Book use specific 
source files, such as image files created in Adobe Illustrator, video files created in 
Adobe After Effects, audio files, and prepared Flash documents. To complete the 
lessons in this book, you must copy these files from the Adobe Flash Professional 
CS6 Classroom in a Book CD (inside the back cover of this book) to your hard 
drive. Follow these steps to copy the lesson files:
1 On your hard drive, create a new folder in a convenient location and name it 
FlashProCS6_CIB, following the standard procedure for your operating system:
• Windows: In Windows 7 or Vista, right-click and choose New > Folder. 
Then enter the new name for your folder.
• Mac OS: In the Finder, choose File > New Folder. Type the new name and 
drag the folder to the location you want to use.
Now, you can copy the source files onto your hard drive.
2 Drag the Lessons folder (which contains folders named Lesson01, Lesson02, 
and so on) from the Adobe Flash Professional CS6 Classroom in a Book CD onto 
your hard drive to your new FlashProCS6_CIB folder.
When you begin each lesson, navigate to the folder with that lesson number to 
access all the assets, sample movies, and other project files you need to complete 
the lesson.
If you have limited storage space on your computer, you can copy each lesson 
folder as you need it, and then delete it after you’ve completed the lesson if desired. 
Some lessons build on preceding lessons; in those cases, a starting project file is 
provided for you for the second lesson or project. You do not have to save any fin-
ished project if you don’t want to or if you have limited hard drive space.
Copying the sample movies and projects
You will create and publish SWF animation files in some lessons in this book. 
The files in the End folders (01End, 02End, and so on) within the Lesson folders are 
samples of completed projects for each lesson. Use these files for reference if you 
want to compare your work-in-progress with the project files used to generate the 
sample movies. The end project files vary in size from relatively small to a couple of 
megabytes, so you can either copy them all now if you have ample storage space or 
copy just the end project file for each lesson as needed. Then you can delete it when 
you finish that lesson.

How to Use the Lessons
Each lesson in this book provides step-by-step instructions for creating one or 
more specific elements of a real-world project. Some lessons build on projects 
created in preceding lessons; most stand alone. All the lessons build on each 
other in terms of concepts and skills, so the best way to learn from this book is 
to proceed through the lessons in sequential order. In this book, some techniques 
and processes are explained and described in detail only the first few times you 
perform them. 
The organization of the lessons is also project-oriented rather than feature-oriented. 
That means, for example, that you’ll work with symbols on real-world design projects 
over several lessons rather than in just one chapter.

Adobe Flash Professional CS6 Classroom in a Book is not meant to replace docu-
mentation that comes with the program or to be a comprehensive reference for 
every feature. Only the commands and options used in the lessons are explained in

In Flash, the Stage is where the action takes place, 
the Timeline organizes frames and layers, and other 
panels let you edit and control your creation. 

10 
Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
Starting Flash and Opening a File
The first time you start Flash you’ll see a Welcome screen with links to standard 
file templates, tutorials, and other resources. In this lesson, you’ll create a simple 
animation to showcase a few vacation snapshots. You’ll add the photos and a title, 
and in the process you’ll learn about positioning elements on the Stage and placing 
them along the Timeline. It’s important to understand that the Stage is used to 
organize your visual elements spatially, and the Timeline is used to organize your 
elements temporally.
1 Start Adobe Flash Professional CS6. In Windows, choose Start > All Programs > 
Adobe Flash Professional CS6. In Mac OS, click Adobe Flash Professional CS6 
in the Applications folder or the Dock. 
2 Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, select the 01End.fla file in the 
Lesson01/01End folder and click Open to see the final project.
3 Choose File > Publish Preview > HTML. 
Flash creates the necessary files (an HTML file and a SWF file) to display 
the final animation in your default browser. An animation plays. During the 
animation, several overlapping photos appear one by one, ending with a title.
4 Close the browser.
P Note: You can also 
start Flash by double-
clicking a Flash file 
(*.fla or *.xfl), such as 
the 01End.fla file that is 
provided to show you 
the completed project.
P Note: If your 
computer is missing 
a font that the final 
project contains, Flash 
displays a warning 
dialog box. You can 
manually choose a 
substitute if you wish, or 
simply click Use Default 
and Flash will do so 
automatically.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 11
creating a new document
You’ll create the simple animation that you just previewed by starting a new 
document.
1 In Flash, choose File > New. 
The New Document dialog box opens. 
2 Under the General tab, choose ActionScript 3.0.
ActionScript 3.0 is the latest version of Flash’s scripting language, which you use 
to add interactivity. In this lesson, you will not be working with ActionScript, 
but you still must choose with which version your file is compatible. Choosing 
ActionScript 3.0 creates a new document configured for playback in a desktop 
browser (such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) with Flash Player.
The other options target alternative playback environments. For example, AIR 
for Android and AIR for iOS create new documents configured for playback 
with AIR on an Android or an Apple mobile device.

Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
3 On the right-hand side of the dialog box, you can choose the dimensions of 
the Stage by entering new pixel values for the Width and Height. Enter 800 for 
Width and 600 for Height. Keep the Ruler units as Pixels.
Leave the Frame rate and Background color for the Stage at their default 
settings. You can always edit these document properties, as explained later 
in this lesson.
4 Click OK.
Flash creates a new ActionScript 3.0 file with all the specified settings.
5 Choose File > Save. Name the file 01_workingcopy.fla, and from the Format/Save 
as Type pull-down menu choose Flash CS6 document (*.fla). Save it in the 01Start 
folder. Saving your file right away is a good working habit that ensures your work 
won’t be lost if the application or your computer crashes. You should always save 
your Flash file with the extension .fla to identify it as the Flash source file.
Getting to Know the Workspace
The Adobe Flash Professional work area includes the command menus at the top 
of the screen and a variety of tools and panels for editing and adding elements to 
your movie. You can create all the objects for your animation in Flash, or you can 
import elements you’ve created in Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe 
After Effects, and other compatible applications. 
By default, Flash displays the menu bar, Timeline, Stage, Tools panel, Properties 
inspector, and a few other panels. As you work in Flash, you can open, close, 
dock, undock, and move panels around the screen to fit your work style or your 
screen resolution. 
P Note: For simple 
projects, such as the 
example animation 
you’ll create in this 
lesson, creating a 
single FLA document 
is sufficient. However, 
for more complex 
projects that require 
coordination with 
multiple developers 
or for projects 
intended for playback 
in several different 
environments (desktop 
and mobile), it’s best to 
use the Project panel 
(Window > Project) to 
create a new project. A 
project helps organize 
multiple assets. You’ll 
learn about the Project 
panel in Lesson 10, 
“Publishing Flash 
Documents.”

choosing a new workspace
Flash also provides a few preset panel arrangements that may better suit the needs of 
particular users. The various workspace arrangements are listed in a pull-down menu 
at the top right of the Flash workspace or in the top menu under Window > Workspace.
1 Click the Essentials button at the top right of the Flash workspace and choose 
one of the other predefined workspaces.
The various panels are rearranged and resized according to their importance to 
the particular user. For example, the Animator and Designer workspaces put the 
Timeline at the top for easy and frequent access.

Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
2 If you’ve moved some of the panels around and want to return to one of the 
prearranged workspaces, choose Window > Workspace > Reset and the name of 
the preset workspace.
3 To return to the default workspace, choose Window > Workspace > Essentials. 
In this Classroom in a Book, we’ll be using the Essentials workspace.
Saving your workspace
If you find an arrangement of panels comfortable for your style of work, you can 
save the custom workspace to return to it at a later date.
1 Click the Workspace button at the top-right corner of the Flash workspace and 
choose New Workspace.
The New Workspace dialog box appears.
2 Enter a name for your new workspace. Click OK.
Flash saves the current arrangement of panels. Your workspace is added to the 
options in the Workspace pull-down menu, which you can access at any time.
About the Stage
The big white rectangle in the middle of your screen is called the Stage. As with a 
theater stage, the Stage in Flash is the area that viewers see when a movie is playing. 
It contains the text, images, and video that appear on the screen. Move elements on 
and off the Stage to move them in and out of view. You can use the rulers (View > 
Rulers) or grids (View > Grid > Show Grid) to help you position items on the Stage. 
Additionally, you can use the Align panel and other tools you’ll learn about in the 
lessons in this book.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 15
By default, you’ll see the gray area off the Stage where you can place elements that 
won’t be visible to your audience. The gray area is called the Pasteboard. To just 
see the Stage, choose View > Pasteboard to deselect the option. For now, leave the 
option selected.
To scale the Stage so that it fits completely in the application window, choose 
View > Magnification > Fit in Window. You can also choose different magnification 
view options from the pop-up menu just above the Stage. 
changing the Stage properties
Now you’ll change the color of the Stage. The Stage color, and other document 
properties such as the Stage dimensions and frame rate, are available in the 
Properties inspector, which is the vertical panel just to the right of the Stage.
1 At the bottom of the Properties inspector, note that the dimensions of the 
current Stage are set at 800 x 600 pixels, which you chose when you created the 
new document.

16 
Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
2 Click the Background color button next to Stage and choose a new color from 
the color palette. Choose dark gray (#333333).
Your Stage is now a different color. You can change the Stage properties at any time.
Working with the Library Panel
The Library panel is accessible from a tab just to the right of the Properties inspec-
tor. The Library panel is where you store and organize symbols created in Flash, 
as well as imported files, including bitmaps, graphics, sound files, and video clips. 
Symbols are often-used graphics used for animation and for interactivity. 
About the Library panel
The Library panel lets you organize library items in folders, see how often an item 
is used in a document, and sort items by type. When you import items into Flash, 
you can import them directly onto the Stage or into the library. However, any item 
you import onto the Stage is also added to the library, as are any symbols you cre-
ate. You can then easily access the items to add them to the Stage again, edit them, 
or see their properties.
To display the Library panel, choose Window > Library, or press Ctrl+L (Windows) 
or Command+L (Mac).
importing an item to the Library panel
Often, you’ll be creating graphics directly with Flash’s drawing tools and saving them 
as symbols, which are stored in the library. Other times you’ll be importing media 
such as JPEG images or MP3 sound files, which are also stored in the library. In this 
lesson, you’ll import several JPEG images into the library to be used in the animation.
1 Choose File > Import > Import to Library. In the Import to Library dialog box, 
select the background.jpg file in the Lesson01/01Start folder, and click Open.
2 Flash imports the selected JPEG image and places it in the Library panel.
P Note: You’ll learn 
much more about 
symbols in Lesson 3, 
“Creating and Editing 
Symbols.”

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 17
3 Continue importing photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, and photo3.jpg from the 01Start folder. 
Don’t import the last image, photo4.jpg. You’ll use that image later in this lesson.
You can also hold down the Shift key to select multiple files and import all of 
them at once.
4 The Library panel displays all the imported JPEG images with their filenames 
and a thumbnail preview. These images are now available to be used in your 
Flash document.
Adding an item from the Library panel to the Stage
To use an imported image, simply drag it from the Library panel onto the Stage.
1 Choose Window > Library to open the Library panel if it isn’t already open.
2 Select the background.jpg item in the Library panel.
3 Drag the background.jpg item onto the Stage and place it approximately in the 
center of the Stage.
P Note: You can also 
choose File > Import > 
Import to Stage, or 
Ctrl+R (Windows) or 
Command+R (Mac) to 
import an image file to 
the Library and put it on 
the Stage all in one step.

18 
Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
understanding the timeline
The Timeline is located below the Stage. Like films, Flash documents measure time 
in frames. As the movie plays, the playhead, shown as a red vertical line, advances 
through the frames in the Timeline. You can change the content on the Stage for 
different frames. To display a frame’s content on the Stage, move the playhead to 
that frame in the Timeline. 
At the bottom of the Timeline, Flash indicates the selected frame number, the cur-
rent frame rate (how many frames play per second), and the time that has elapsed 
so far in the movie.
Current frame
Frame rate
Elapsed time (seconds)
The Timeline also contains layers, which help you organize the artwork in your 
document. At the moment, your project only has one layer, which is called Layer 1. 
Think of layers as multiple film strips stacked on top of each other. Each layer can 
contain a different image that appears on the Stage, and you can draw and edit 
objects on one layer without affecting objects on another layer. The layers are 
stacked in the order in which they overlap each other, so that objects on the bottom 
layer in the Timeline are on the bottom of the stack on the Stage. You can hide, 
lock, or show the contents of layers as outlines by clicking the dots in the layer 
under the layer option icons. 
Layer name
Show/Hide Layer Lock/Unlock Layer
Show Layer as Outlines

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 19
Renaming a layer
It’s a good idea to separate your content on different layers and name each layer to 
indicate its contents so that you can easily find the layer you need later.
1 Select the existing layer in the Timeline, called Layer 1.
2 Double-click the name of the layer to rename it and type background. 
3 Click outside the name box to apply the new name. 
4 Click the dot below the lock icon to lock the layer. Locking a layer prevents you 
from accidentally making changes to it.
The pencil icon with a diagonal slash that appears after the layer name indicates 
that you can’t make edits to the layer because it is locked.
Adding a layer
A new Flash document contains only one layer, but you can add as many layers as 
you need. Objects in the top layers will overlap objects in the bottom layers.
1 Select the background layer in the Timeline. 
2 Choose Insert > Timeline > Layer. You can also click the New Layer button (
) 
below the Timeline. A new layer appears above the background layer. 
3 Double-click the new layer to rename it and type photo1. Click outside the 
name box to apply the new name. 
Your Timeline now has two layers. The background layer contains the 
background photo, and the newly created photo1 layer above it is empty.
4 Select the top layer called photo1.

20 
Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
5 Choose Window > Library to open the Library panel if it isn’t already open.
6 Drag the library item called photo1.jpg from the library on to the Stage.
The photo1 JPEG appears on the Stage and overlaps the background JPEG.
7 Choose Insert > Timeline > Layer or click the New Layer button below the 
Timeline to add a third layer.
8 Rename the third layer photo2.
Working with Layers
If you don’t want a layer, you can easily 
delete it by selecting it and then clicking 
the Delete button below the Timeline. 
If you want to rearrange your layers, 
simply click and drag any layer to move it 
to a new position in the layer stack.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 21
inserting frames
So far, you have a background photo and another overlapping photo on the Stage, 
but your entire animation exists for only a single frame. To create more time on the 
Timeline, you must add additional frames.
1 Select frame 48 in the background layer.
2 Choose Insert > Timeline > Frame (F5). You can also right-click (Windows) or 
Ctrl-click (Mac) and choose Insert Frame from the context menu that pops up. 
Flash adds frames in the background layer up to the selected point, frame 48.
3 Select frame 48 in the photo1 layer.
4 Choose Insert > Timeline > Frame (F5). You can also right-click/Ctrl-click and 
choose Insert Frame from the context menu. 
Flash adds frames in the photo1 layer up to the selected point, frame 48. 
5 Select frame 48 in the photo2 layer and insert frames on this layer. 
You now have three layers, all with 48 frames on the Timeline. Since the frame 
rate of your Flash document is 24 frames per second, your current animation lasts 
two seconds. 

22 
Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
Selecting Multiple Frames
Just as you can hold down the Shift key to select multiple files on your desktop, 
you can hold down the Shift key to select multiple frames on the Flash Timeline. 
If you have several layers and want to insert frames into all of them, hold down the 
Shift key and click on the point at which you want to add frames in all of your layers. 
Then choose Insert > Timeline > Frame. 
creating a keyframe
A keyframe indicates a change in content on the Stage. Keyframes are indicated on 
the Timeline as a circle. An empty circle means there is nothing in that particular 
layer at that particular time. A filled-in black circle means there is something in 
that particular layer at that particular time. The background layer, for example, 
contains a filled keyframe (black circle) in the first frame. The photo1 layer also 
contains a filled keyframe in its first frame. Both layers contain photos. The photo2 
layer, however, contains an empty keyframe in the first frame, indicating that it is 
currently empty. 
Empty keyframe
Filled keyframe
You’ll insert a keyframe in the photo2 layer at the point in time when you want the 
next photo to appear.
1 Select frame 24 on the photo2 layer. As you select a frame, Flash displays the 
frame number beneath the Timeline.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 23
2 Choose Insert > Timeline > Keyframe (F6).
A new keyframe, indicated by an empty circle, appears in the photo2 layer in 
frame 24.
3 Select the new keyframe at frame 24 in the photo2 layer.
4 Drag the photo2.jpg item from your library onto the Stage.
The empty circle at frame 24 becomes filled, indicating there is now a change in 
the photo2 layer. At frame 24, your photo appears on the Stage. You can click 
and drag the red playhead from the top of the Timeline to “scrub,” or show 
what’s happening on the Stage at any point along the Timeline. You’ll see that 
the background photo and photo1 remain on the Stage throughout the Timeline 
but photo2 appears only at frame 24. 

24 
Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
Understanding frames and keyframes is essential for mastering Flash. Be sure you 
understand how the photo2 layer contains 48 frames with 2 keyframes—an empty 
keyframe at frame 1 and a filled keyframe at frame 24.
photo2 layer 
is empty from 
frames 1–23
photo2 layer  
contains content from  
frames 24–48
Moving a keyframe
If you want your photo2.jpg to appear later or earlier, you need to move the key-
frame in which it appears later or earlier along the Timeline. You can easily move 
any keyframe along the Timeline by simply selecting it and then dragging it to a 
new position. 
1 Select the keyframe in frame 24 on the photo2 layer.
2 Move your mouse cursor slightly, and you’ll see a box icon appear near your 
cursor indicating that you can reposition the keyframe.
3 Click and drag the keyframe to frame 12 in the photo2 layer.
The photo2.jpg now appears on the Stage much earlier in the animation.
Removing Keyframes
If you want to remove a keyframe, do not press the Delete key! Doing so will delete 
the contents of that keyframe on the Stage. Instead, select the keyframe and choose 
Modify > Timeline > Clear Keyframe (Shift+F6). Your keyframe will be removed from 
the Timeline.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 25
Organizing Layers in a timeline
At this point, your working Flash file has only three layers: a background layer, a 
photo1 layer, and a photo2 layer. You’ll be adding additional layers for this project, 
and like with most other projects, you’ll end up having to manage multiple layers. 
Layer folders help you group related layers to keep your Timeline organized and 
manageable, just like you make folders for related documents on your desktop. 
Although it may take some time to create the folders, you’ll save time later because 
you’ll know exactly where to look for a specific layer.
creating layer folders
For this project, you’ll continue to add layers for additional photos, and you’ll place 
those layers in a layer folder.
1 Select the photo2 layer and click the New Layer button at the bottom of the 
Timeline (
).
2 Name the layer photo3.
3 Insert a keyframe at frame 24.
4 Drag the photo3.jpg from the library onto the Stage.
You now have four layers. The top three contain photos of scenes from Coney 
Island that appear at different keyframes.

26 
Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
5 Select the photo3 layer and click the New Folder icon at the bottom of the 
Timeline (
).
A new layer folder appears above the photo3 layer.
6 Name the folder photos.
Adding layers to layer folders
Now you’ll add the photo layers to the photo folder. As you arrange layers, remem-
ber that Flash displays content in the layers in the order in which they appear in the 
Timeline, with the top layer’s content at the front and the bottom layer’s content 
at the back.
1 Drag the photo1 layer into the photos folder.
Notice how the bold line indicates the destination of your layer. When a layer is 
placed inside a folder, the layer name is indented.
2 Drag the photo2 layer into the photos folder.
3 Drag the photo3 layer into the photos folder.
All three photo layers should be in the photos folder. 
You can collapse the folder by clicking the arrow. Expand the folder by clicking the 
arrow again. Be aware that if you delete a layer folder, you delete all the layers inside 
that folder as well.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 27
changing the appearance of the timeline
You can adjust the Timeline’s appearance to accommodate your workflow. When 
you want to see more layers, select Short from the Frame View pop-up menu in the 
upper-right corner of the Timeline. The Short option decreases the height of frame 
cell rows. The Preview and Preview in Context options display thumbnail versions 
of the contents of your keyframes in the Timeline.
You can also change the width of the frame cells by selecting Tiny, Small, Normal, 
Medium, or Large. 
cut, copy, Paste, and  
duplicate Layers
When managing multiple layers and layer 
folders, you can rely on cut, copy, paste, and 
duplicate layer commands to make your 
workflow easier and more efficient. All the 
properties of the selected layer are copied 
and pasted, including its frames, keyframes, 
any animation, and even the layer name and 
type. Layer folders and their contents can 
also be copied and pasted.
To cut or copy any layer or layer folder, sim-
ply select the layer and right-click/Ctrl-click 
the layer. In the contextual menu that appears, choose Cut Layers or Copy Layers.
Right-click/Ctrl-click on the Timeline again, and choose Paste Layers. The layer or 
layers that you cut or copied are pasted into the Timeline. Use Duplicate Layers to 
copy and paste in one operation.
You can also Cut, Copy, Paste, or Duplicate layers from the top Flash menu. 
Choose Edit > Timeline > and choose Cut Layers, Copy Layers, Paste Layers, or 
Duplicate Layers.

28 
Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
using the Properties inspector 
The Properties inspector gives you quick access to the attributes you’re most likely 
to need. What appears in the Properties inspector depends on what you’ve selected. 
For example, if nothing is selected, the Properties inspector includes options for 
the general Flash document including changing the Stage color or dimensions; if an 
object on the Stage is selected, the Properties inspector shows its x and y coordi-
nates and its width and height, among other information. You’ll use the Properties 
inspector to move your photos on the Stage. 
Positioning an object on the Stage
You’ll begin by moving the photos with the Properties inspector. You’ll also use the 
Transform panel to rotate the photos.
1 At frame 1 of the Timeline, select the photo1.jpg image that you dragged onto 
the Stage in the photo1 layer. A blue outline indicates that the object is selected.
2 In the Properties inspector, type 50 for the X value and 50 for the Y value. Press 
Enter/Return to apply the values. You can also click and drag your mouse cursor 
over the X and Y values to change their positions. The photo moves to the left 
side of the Stage. 
The X and Y values are measured on the Stage from the top-left corner. 
X begins at 0 and increases to the right, and Y begins at 0 and increases 
downward. The registration point for imported photos is at the top-left corner.
P Note: If the 
Properties inspector 
is not open, choose 
Window > Properties, 
or press Ctrl/
Command+F3.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 29
3 Choose Window > Transform to open the Transform panel. 
4 In the Transform panel, select Rotate, and type -12 in the Rotate box, or click 
and drag over the value to change the rotation. Press Enter/Return to apply 
the value.
The selected photo on the Stage rotates 12 degrees counterclockwise.
5 Select frame 12 of the photo2 layer. Now click on the photo2.jpg on the Stage.
6 Use the Properties inspector and Transform panel to position and rotate the 
second photo in an interesting way. Use X=80, Y=50, and a Rotate of 6 to give 
it some contrast with the first photo.

Working with Panels
Just about everything you do 
in Flash involves a panel. In this 
lesson, you use the Library panel, 
Tools panel, Properties inspector, 
Transform panel, History panel, and 
the Timeline. In later lessons, you’ll 
use the Actions panel, the Color 
panel, the Motion panel, and other 
panels that let you control various 
aspects of your project. Because 
panels are such an integral part 
of the Flash workspace, it pays to 
know how to manage them. 
To open any panel in Flash, choose 
its name from the Window menu. In 
a few cases, you may need to choose 
the panel from a submenu, such as 
Window > Other Panels > History. 
By default, the Properties inspec-
tor, Library panel, and Tools panel 
appear together at the right of the 
screen; the Timeline and Motion 
Editor are at the bottom; and the 
Stage is on the top. However, you 
can move a panel to any position 
that is convenient for you. 
• 
To undock a panel from the right side of the screen, drag it by its tab to a 
new location.
• 
To dock a panel, drag it by its tab into the dock at a new position on the screen. 
You can drag it to the top, bottom, or in between other panels. A blue highlight 
indicates where you can dock a panel.
• 
To group a panel with another, drag its tab onto the other panel’s tab.
• 
To move a panel group, drag the group by its dark gray top bar.
You also have the option of displaying most of the panels as icons to save space but 
still maintain quick access. Click the upper-right arrows to collapse the panels to 
icons. Click the arrows again to expand the panels. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 31
7 Select frame 24 in the photo3 layer. Now click on photo3.jpg on the Stage.
8 Use the Properties inspector and Transform panel to position and rotate the 
third photo in an interesting way. Use X=120, Y=55, and a Rotate of –2 so all 
your photos have visual variety.
using the tools Panel
The Tools panel—the long, narrow panel on the far right side of the work area—
contains selection tools, drawing and type tools, painting and editing tools, naviga-
tion tools, and tool options. You’ll use the Tools panel frequently to switch to tools 
designed for the task at hand. You’ll most often be using the Selection tool, which is 
the black arrow tool at the top of the Tools panel, for selecting and clicking on items 
on the Stage or the Timeline. When you select a tool, check the options area at the 
bottom of the panel for more options and other settings appropriate for your task. 
Selecting and using a tool
When you select a tool, the options available at the bottom of the Tools panel and 
the Properties inspector change. For example, when you select the Rectangle tool, 
the Object Drawing mode and Snap To Objects options appear. When you select 
the Zoom tool, the Enlarge and Reduce options appear. 
The Tools panel contains too many tools to display all at once. Some tools are 
arranged in hidden groups in the Tools panel; only the tool you last selected from 
a group is displayed. A small triangle in the lower-right corner of the tool’s button 
indicates there are other tools in the group. Click and hold the icon for the visible 
tool to see the other tools available, and then select one from the pop-up menu.
P Note: When images 
are scaled or rotated in 
Flash, they may appear 
jagged. You can smooth 
them out by double-
clicking the bitmap icon 
in the Library panel. In 
the Bitmap Properties 
dialog box that appears, 
select the Allow 
Smoothing option.

Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
You’ll use the Text tool to add a title to your animation.
1 Select the top layer in the Timeline, and then click the New Layer button.
2 Name the new layer text.
3 Lock the other layers below it so you don’t accidentally move anything into them.
4 In the Timeline, move the playhead to frame 36 and select frame 36 in the 
text layer.
5 Choose Insert > Timeline > Keyframe (F6) to insert a new keyframe at frame 36 
in the text layer.
You will create text to appear at frame 36 in this layer.
6 In the Tools panel, select the Text tool, which is indicated by the large capital 
letter T.
7 In the Properties inspector, choose Classic Text from the pull-down menu. 
Choose Static Text from the pull-down menu that appears below.
Classic Text is a mode for adding simple text that doesn’t require sophisticated 
options such as multiple columns or wrapping around other objects. Static 
Text is the option for any text that is used for display purposes. Dynamic and 
Input Text are special text options for more interactive purposes and can be 
controlled with ActionScript. You’ll learn about more advanced text options in 
Lesson 7, “Using Text.”
8 Select a font and size in the Properties inspector. Your computer may not 
have the same fonts as those shown in this lesson, but choose one that is close 
in appearance.
9 Click the colored square in the Properties inspector to choose a text color. You 
can click on the color wheel at the upper right to access the OS Color Picker, or 
you can change the Alpha percentage at the upper right, which determines the 
level of transparency.

your text on the Stage, if desired. Or, choose the Selection tool and simply drag 
your text to a new position on the Stage. The X and Y values in the Properties 
inspector update as you drag the text around the Stage.
14 Your animation for this lesson is finished! Compare the Timeline in your file 
with the Timeline in the final file, 01End.fla.
undoing Steps in Flash
In a perfect world, everything would go according to plan. But sometimes you need 
to move back a step or two and start over. You can undo steps in Flash using the 
Undo command or the History panel. 
To undo a single step in Flash, choose Edit > Undo or press Ctrl/Command+Z. 
To redo a step you’ve undone, choose Edit > Redo. 
To undo multiple steps in Flash, it’s easiest to use the History panel, which displays 
a list of all the last 100 steps you’ve performed. Closing a document clears its his-
tory. To access the History panel, choose Window > Other Panels > History. 
For example, if you aren’t satisfied with the newly added text, you can undo your 
work and return your Flash document to a previous state.

36 
Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
1 Choose Edit > Undo to undo the last action you made. You can choose the 
Undo command multiple times to move backward as many steps as are listed in 
the History panel. You can change the maximum number of Undo commands 
by selecting Flash > Preferences.
2 Choose Window > Other Panels > History to open the History panel.
3 Drag the History panel slider up to the step just before your mistake. Steps 
below that point are dimmed in the History panel and are removed from the 
project. To add a step back, move the slider back down. 
Previewing Your Movie
As you work on a project, it’s a good idea to preview it frequently to ensure that 
you’re achieving the desired effect. To quickly see how an animation or movie will 
appear to a viewer, choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. You can 
also press Ctrl+Enter or Command+Return to preview your movie.
1 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. 
Flash creates a SWF file in the same location as your FLA file and opens and 
plays the file in a separate window. A SWF file is the compressed, published file 
that you would upload to the Web to play in a browser on the desktop.
P Note: If you remove 
steps in the History 
panel and then perform 
additional steps, the 
removed steps will no 
longer be available.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 37
Flash automatically loops your movie in this preview mode. If you don’t want 
the movie to loop, choose Control > Loop to deselect the option.
2 Close the preview window.
3 Click on the Stage with the Selection tool. Note at the bottom of the Properties 
inspector that the SWF History displays and keeps a log of the file size, date, 
and time of the most recent SWF file published. This will help you keep track 
of your work progress and revisions.

38 
Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
Modifying the content and Stage
When you first started this lesson, you created a new file with the Stage set at 800 
pixels by 600 pixels. However, your client may later tell you that they want the 
animation in several different sizes to accommodate different layouts. For example, 
they’d like to create a smaller version with a different aspect ratio for a banner ad. 
Or, they may want to create a version that will run on AIR for Android devices, 
which have specific dimensions.
Fortunately, you can modify the Stage even after all your content is put in place. 
When you change the Stage dimensions, Flash provides the option of scaling 
the content with the Stage, automatically shrinking or enlarging all your content 
proportionally.
Stage Resizing and content Scaling
You’ll create another version of this animated project with different Stage dimensions.
1 At the bottom of the Properties inspector, note that the dimensions of the 
current Stage are set at 800 x 600 pixels. Click the Edit button next to the Stage 
size (the wrench icon).
The Document Settings dialog box appears.
2 In the Width and Height boxes, enter new pixel dimensions. Enter 400 for the 
Width and 300 for the Height.
Notice that as you enter new values for the Width and the Height, the option to 
Scale content with stage becomes enabled.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 39
3 Check the option to Scale content with stage.
4 Click OK.
Flash modifies the dimensions of the Stage and automatically resizes all the 
content. If your new dimensions are not proportional to the original size, Flash 
will resize everything to maximize the content to fit. This means that if your 
new Stage size is wider than the original, there’ll be extra Stage space to the 
right. If your new Stage size is taller than the original, there’ll be extra Stage 
space on the bottom.
5 Choose File > Save As, and choose Flash CS6 Document for the Format. Name 
the file 01_workingcopy_resized.fla.
You now have two Flash files, identical in content but with different Stage 
dimensions. Close this file and re-open 01_workingcopy.fla to continue 
this lesson.
Saving Your Movie
A mantra in multimedia production is “Save early, save often.” Applications, operat-
ing systems, and hardware crash more often than anyone wants, and at unexpected 
and inconvenient times. You should always be saving your movie at regular intervals 
to ensure that, if a crash does happen, you won’t have lost too much of your time.
Flash can help alleviate much of the worry over lost work. The Auto-Save feature 
automatically saves your file at specified intervals, and the Auto-Recovery feature 
creates a backup file in case of a crash.

40 
Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
using Auto-Save
The Auto-Save feature, when enabled, saves your Flash file automatically at regular 
intervals that you set. You can set your Flash file to Auto-Save anywhere between 
1 minute and 1440 minutes (24 hours).
1 At the bottom of the Properties inspector, click the Edit button next to the Stage 
size (the wrench icon).
The Document Settings dialog box appears.
2 Check the Auto-Save option and enter a desired interval for each save.
3 Click OK.
Rest easy. Your old Flash file will be replaced by the open document at the 
predetermined intervals. An open document that has unsaved changes is indicated 
by an asterisk at the end of its filename at the top of the document window.
using Auto-Recovery for a backup
The Auto-Recovery feature works a little differently from the Auto-Save feature. 
The Auto-Recovery feature is a preference set for the Flash application for all docu-
ments, while the Auto-Save feature is specific for each document.
The Auto-Recovery feature saves a backup file, so that in case of a crash, you have 
an alternate file to return to.
1 Choose Flash > Preferences (Mac) or Edit > Preferences (Windows).
The Preferences dialog box appears.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 41
2 Choose the General category from the left column.
3 Select the Auto-Recovery option and enter a time (in minutes) for the interval 
that Flash creates a backup file.
4 Click OK.
Flash creates a new file in the same location as your FLA with RECOVER_
added to the beginning of the filename.
The file remains as long as the document is open. When you close the document 
or when you quit Flash safely, the file is deleted.

42 
Lesson 1 
Getting Acquainted
Saving an XFL document
You’ve already saved your Flash movie as an FLA file, but another option is to save 
your movie in an uncompressed format known as XFL. The XFL format is actually 
a folder of files rather than a single document. The XFL file format exposes the con-
tents of your Flash movie so that other developers or animators can easily edit your 
file or manage its assets without having to open the movie in the Flash application. 
For example, all the imported photos in your Library panel appear in a Library 
folder within the XFL format. You can edit the library photos or swap them with 
new photos. Flash will make the substitutions in the movie automatically.
1 Choose File > Save As.
2 Name the file 01_workingcopy.xfl and choose Flash CS6 Uncompressed 
Document (*.xfl). Click Save.
Flash creates a folder named 01_workingcopy, which contains all the files for 
your Flash movie.
3 Close the Flash document by choosing File > Close.
Modifying an XFL document
In this exercise, you’ll modify the Library folder of the XFL document to make 
changes to your Flash movie.
1 Open the LIBRARY folder inside the 01_workingcopy folder.
The folder contains all the photos you imported into your Flash movie.
2 Select the photo3.jpg file and delete it.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 43
3 Drag the photo4.jpg file from the 01Start folder and move it to the LIBRARY 
folder inside the 01_workingcopy folder. Rename photo4.jpg as photo3.jpg.
Swapping out photo3.jpg with a new image in the LIBRARY folder 
automatically makes the change in the Flash movie.
4 To open an XFL document, double-click the .xfl file.
The last image in keyframe 24 of your Timeline has been swapped with the 
photo4.jpg image with which you made the substitution.

Publishing Your Movie
When you’re ready to share your movie with others, publish it from Flash. For some 
projects, that means posting an HTML file and a SWF file to the Web so your audi-
ence can view it in a desktop browser. For other projects, it may involve publishing 
an application file for your audience to download and view on a mobile device. 
Flash provides options to publish for a variety of platforms. You’ll learn more about 
publishing options in Lesson 10 “Publishing Flash Documents.”
For this lesson, you’ll create an HTML file and a SWF file. The SWF file is your final 
Flash movie, and the HTML file tells the Web browser how to display the SWF file. 
You’ll need to upload both files to the same folder on your Web server. Always test 
your movie after uploading it to be certain that it’s working properly.
1 Choose File > Publish Settings, or click the Publish Settings button in the Profile 
section of the Properties Inspector.
The Publish Settings dialog box appears. The output formats appear on the left, 
and their corresponding settings appear on the right.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 45
2 Check the Flash and HTML Wrapper options if they are not already checked.
3 Select HTML Wrapper.
The options for the HTML file determine how the SWF file appears in the 
browser. For this lesson, keep all the default settings. If the Loop check box is 
selected, deselect it.
4 Click Publish at the bottom of the Publish Settings dialog box.
5 Click OK to close the dialog box.
6 Navigate to the Lesson01/01Start folder to see the files Flash created.

Review Answers
1 The Stage is the rectangular area viewers see when a movie is playing. It contains 
the text, images, and video that appear on the screen. Objects that you store on the 
Pasteboard outside of the Stage do not appear in the movie. 
2 A frame is a measure of time on the Timeline. A keyframe is represented on the 
Timeline with a circle and indicates a change in content on the Stage.
3 Because there are too many tools to display at once in the Tools panel, some tools are 
grouped, and only one tool in the group is displayed. (The tool you most recently used 
is the one shown.) Small triangles appear on tool icons to indicate that hidden tools are 
available. To select a hidden tool, click and hold the tool icon for the tool that is shown, 
and then select the hidden tool from the menu.

You can use rectangles, ovals, and lines to create  
interesting, complex graphics and illustrations in 
Flash. Edit their shapes and combine them with  
gradients, transparencies, text, and filters for even 
greater possibilities. 

50 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
getting started
Start by viewing the finished movie to see the animation you’ll be creating in 
this lesson. 
1 Double-click the 02End.html file in the Lesson02/02End folder to view the final 
project in a browser.
The project is a simple static illustration for a banner ad. This illustration is for 
Garden Court Cafe, a fictional company that’s promoting its store and coffee. In 
this lesson, you’ll draw the shapes, modify them, and learn to combine simple 
elements to create more complex visuals. You won’t create any animation just 
yet. After all, you must learn to walk before you can run! And learning to create 
and modify graphics is an important step before doing any Flash animation.
2 In Flash, choose File > New. In the New Document dialog box, choose 
ActionScript 3.0. 
3 On the right-hand side of the dialog box, make the Stage size 700 pixels by 200 
pixels and make the color of the Stage a light brown by clicking the icon next to 
Background color. Click OK.
4 Choose File > Save. Name the file 02_workingcopy.fla and save it in the 02Start 
folder. Saving your file right away is a good working habit (even if you’ve 
enabled the Auto-Recovery feature) and ensures that your work won’t be lost if 
the application or your computer crashes.
Understanding strokes and Fills
Every graphic in Flash starts with a shape. A shape is made of two components: the 
fill, or the insides of the shape; and the stroke, or the outlines of the shape. If you 
always keep these two components in mind, you’ll be well on your way to creating 
beautiful and complicated visuals.
The fill and the stroke are independent of each other, so you can modify or delete 
either without affecting the other. For example, you can create a rectangle with a 
blue fill and a red stroke, and then later change the fill to purple and delete the red 
stroke entirely. All you’ll be left with is a purple rectangle without an outline. You 
can also move the fill or stroke independently, so if you want to move the entire 
shape, make sure that you select both its fill and stroke.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 51
creating shapes
Flash includes several drawing tools, which work in different drawing modes. Many 
of your creations will begin with simple shapes such as rectangles and ovals, so it’s 
important that you’re comfortable drawing them, modifying their appearance, and 
applying fills and strokes. 
You’ll begin by drawing the cup of coffee. 
Using the rectangle tool
The coffee cup is essentially a cylinder, which is a rectangle with an oval at the top 
and an oval at the bottom. You’ll start by drawing the rectangular body. It’s useful 
to break down complicated objects into their component parts to make drawing 
them easier.
1 In the Tools panel, select the Rectangle tool (
). Make sure the Object Drawing 
mode icon (
) is not selected.
2 Choose a stroke color (
) and a fill color (
) from the bottom of the  
Tools panel. Choose #663300 (dark brown) for the stroke and #CC6600  
(light brown) for the fill. 
3 On the Stage, draw a rectangle that is a little taller than it is  
wide. You’ll specify the exact size and position of the rectangle  
in step 6. 
4 Select the Selection tool (
).
5 Drag the Selection tool around the entire rectangle to select  
its stroke and its fill. When a shape is selected, Flash displays  
it with white dots. You can also double-click a shape, and Flash  
will select both the stroke and fill of the shape.
6 In the Properties inspector, type 130 for the width and 150 for  
the height. Press Enter/Return to apply the values. 
Using the oval tool
Now you’ll create the opening at the top and the rounded bottom.
1 In the Tools panel, press and hold your mouse cursor over the Rectangle tool to 
access the hidden tools. Choose the Oval tool. 
 Note: Each color has 
a hexadecimal value in 
Flash, HTML, and many 
other applications. Light 
gray is #999999, white 
is #FFFFFF, and black is 
#000000. You may find it 
handy to memorize the 
values for the colors you 
use most often.

52 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
2 Make sure the Snap to Objects option (
) is enabled. This 
option forces shapes that you draw on the Stage to snap to each 
other to ensure that lines and corners connect to one another.
3 Click inside the rectangle and drag across it to make an oval 
inside the rectangle. The Snap to Objects option makes the sides 
of the oval connect to the sides of the rectangle. 
4 Draw another oval near the bottom of the rectangle. 
Making selections
To modify an object, you must first be able to select different parts of it. In Flash, 
you can make selections using the Selection, Subselection, or Lasso tool. Typically, 
you use the Selection tool to select an entire object or a section of an object. The 
Subselection tool lets you select a specific point or line in an object. With the Lasso 
tool, you can make a freeform selection. 
selecting strokes and fills
Now you’ll make the rectangle and ovals look more like a coffee cup. You’ll use the 
Selection tool to delete unwanted strokes and fills. 
1 In the Tools panel, select the Selection tool (
).
2 Click the fill above the top oval to select it.
The shape above the top oval becomes highlighted.
3 Press the Delete key.
The shape is deleted.
4 Select each of the three line segments above the top oval and 
press the Delete key. 
The individual strokes are deleted, leaving the top oval 
connected to the rectangle.
5 Now select the fill and strokes below the bottom oval, as well as 
the inside arc at the bottom of the cup, and press the Delete key. 
The remaining shape appears as a cylinder.
 Note: Flash applies 
the default fill and 
stroke to the rectangle 
and oval, which are 
determined by the 
last fill and stroke you 
applied.
 Note: Hold down 
the Shift key when 
making selections to 
select multiple fills or 
strokes together.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 53
Editing shapes
When drawing in Flash, you’ll often start with the Rectangle and Oval tools. But to 
create more complex graphics, you’ll use other tools to modify those base shapes. 
The Free Transform tool, the Copy and Paste commands, and the Selection tool can 
help transform the plain cylinder into a coffee cup.
Using the Free transform tool
The coffee cup will look more realistic if you taper the bottom rim. You’ll use the 
Free Transform tool to change its overall shape. With the Free Transform tool, you 
can change an object’s scale, rotation, or skew (the way it is slanted), or distort an 
object by dragging control points around a bounding box.
1 In the Tools panel, select the Free Transform tool (
).
2 Drag the Free Transform tool around the cylinder on the Stage 
to select it.
Transformation handles appear on the cylinder.
3 Press Ctrl/Command+Shift as you drag one of the lower corners 
inward. Holding these keys while dragging lets you move both 
corners the same distance simultaneously.
4 Click outside the shape to deselect it. 
The bottom of the cylinder is narrow, and the top is wide. It now 
looks more like a coffee cup.
Using copy and paste
Use Copy and Paste commands to easily duplicate shapes on the Stage. You’ll set 
the surface level of the coffee by copying and pasting the top rim of the coffee cup.
1 Choose the Selection tool. Hold down the Shift key and select 
the top arc and bottom arc of the coffee cup opening.
2 Choose Edit > Copy (Ctrl/Command+C). The top strokes of the 
oval are copied.
3 Choose Edit > Paste in Center (Ctrl/Command+V). 
A duplicate oval appears on the Stage.
4 In the Tools panel, if it’s not already selected, select the Free Transform tool.
Transformation handles appear on the oval.
 Note: If you press 
Alt or Option while 
moving one of the 
control points, the 
selected object is 
scaled relative to 
its transformation 
point, represented 
by the circle icon. 
You can move the 
transformation point 
anywhere, even outside 
the object. Press Shift 
to constrain the object 
proportions. Press Ctrl/
Command to deform 
the object from a single 
control point.

54 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
5 Press the Shift key and the Alt/Option key as you drag on the 
corners inward. Make the oval about 10 percent smaller. Pressing 
the Shift key lets you change the shape uniformly so the oval 
maintains its aspect ratio. Pressing the Alt/Option key changes the 
shape from its transformation point.
6 Select the Selection tool. 
7 Drag the oval over the rim of the coffee cup so it overlaps the 
front lip.
8 Click outside the selection to deselect the oval. 
9 Select the lower part of the smaller oval and delete it.
Your coffee cup now is filled with coffee!
changing shape contours
With the Selection tool, you can push and pull lines and corners to change the 
overall contours of any shape. It’s a fast and intuitive way of working with shapes.
1 In the Tools panel, select the Selection tool.
2 Move your mouse cursor close to one of the sides of the coffee cup.
A curved line appears near your cursor, indicating that you can change the 
curvature of the stroke.
3 Click and drag the stroke outward.
The sides of the coffee cup bend, giving the coffee cup a slight bulge. 
4 Click and drag the other side of the coffee cup outward slightly. 
The coffee cup now has a more rounded body.
 Note: Hold down 
the Alt/Option key 
while dragging the 
sides of a shape to add 
a new corner.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 55
changing strokes and fills
If you want to change the properties of any stroke or fill, you can use the Ink Bottle 
tool or the Paint Bucket tool. The Ink Bottle tool is used to change fill colors, and 
the Paint Bucket tool is used to change stroke colors.
1 In the Tools panel, select the Paint Bucket tool (
).
2 In the Properties inspector, choose a darker brown color (#663333).
3 Click the top surface of the coffee that is inside the cup.
The fill of the top oval changes to the darker brown color.
4 In the Tools panel, select the Ink Bottle tool (
) that is hidden under the Paint 
Bucket tool. 
5 In the Properties inspector, choose a darker brown color (#330000).
6 Click the top stroke above the surface of the coffee.
The stroke around the surface of the coffee changes to a darker brown color.
 Note: If your Paint 
Bucket tool changes the 
fill in surrounding areas, 
there may be a small 
gap that allows the fill 
to spill over. Close the 
gap, or at the bottom of 
the Tools panel, choose 
to close different gap 
sizes for your Paint 
Bucket tool.
 Note: You can also 
select a stroke or a fill 
and change its color in 
the Properties inspector 
without using the Paint 
Bucket or Ink Bottle tool.

Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
Flash Drawing Modes
Flash provides three drawing modes that determine how objects interact with one 
another on the Stage and how you can edit them. By default, Flash uses Merge 
Drawing mode, but you can enable Object Drawing mode or use the Rectangle 
Primitive or Oval Primitive tool to use Primitive Drawing mode.
Merge Drawing mode
In this mode, Flash merges drawn shapes, such as rectangles and ovals, where they over-
lap, so that multiple shapes appear to be a single shape. If you move or delete a shape 
that has been merged with another, the overlapping portion is permanently removed.
object Drawing mode
In this mode, Flash does not merge drawn objects; they remain distinct and separate, 
even when they overlap. To enable Object Drawing mode, select the tool you want to 
use, and then click the Object Drawing icon in the options area of the Tools panel. 
To convert an object to shapes (Merge Drawing mode), select it and press Ctrl/
Command+B. To convert a shape to an object (Object Drawing mode), select it and 
choose Modify > Combine Objects > Union.
primitive Drawing mode
When you use the Rectangle Primitive tool or the Oval Primitive tool, Flash draws 
the shapes as separate objects. Unlike with regular objects, however, you can 
modify the corner radius and start and end angle of rectangle primitives, and adjust 
the inner radius of oval primitives using the Properties inspector. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 57
Using gradient and Bitmap Fills
The fill is the interior of the drawn object. Currently, you have a solid tan color, but 
you can also have a gradient or a bitmap image (such as a JPEG file) as a fill, or you 
can specify that the object has no fill at all.
In a gradient, one color gradually changes into another. Flash can create linear
gradients, which change color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally; or radial gradi-
ents, which change color moving outward from a central focal point.
For this lesson, you’ll use a linear gradient fill to add three-dimensionality to the 
coffee cup. To give the appearance of a top layer of foaming cream, you’ll import a 
bitmap image to use as the fill. You can import a bitmap file in the Color panel. 
creating gradient transitions
You’ll define the colors you want to use in your gradient in the Color panel. By 
default, a linear gradient moves from one color to a second color, but you can use 
up to 15 color transitions in a gradient in Flash. A color pointer determines where 
the gradient changes from one color to the next. Add color pointers beneath the 
gradient definition bar in the Color panel to add color transitions. 
You’ll create a gradient that moves from tan to white to dark tan on the surface of 
the coffee cup to give it a rounded appearance.
1 Choose the Selection tool. Select the fill that represents 
the front surface of the coffee cup.
2 Open the Color panel (Window > Color). In the Color 
panel, choose the Fill color icon and select Linear 
gradient.
The front surface of the coffee cup is filled with a color 
gradient from left to right.

58 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
3 Select the color pointer on the left of the color gradient in the Color panel (the 
triangle above it turns black when selected), and then type FFCCCC in the Hex 
value field to specify a light tan color. Press Enter/Return to apply the color. You 
can also choose a color from the color picker or double-click the color pointer 
to choose a color from the color swatches.
4 Select the far-right color pointer, and then enter B86241 for a dark tan color. 
Press Enter/Return to apply the color.
The gradient fill for the coffee cup gradually changes from light tan to dark tan 
across its surface.
5 Click beneath the gradient definition bar to create a new color pointer.
6 Drag the new color pointer to the middle of the gradient. 
7 Select the new color pointer, and then type FFFFFF in the Hex value field to 
specify white for the new color. Press Enter/Return to apply the color.
The gradient fill for the coffee cup gradually changes from light tan to white 
to dark tan.
8 Deselect the fill on the Stage by clicking elsewhere on the Stage. Choose the 
Paint Bucket tool and make sure the Lock Fill option (
) at the bottom of the 
Tools panel is deselected.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 59
The Lock Fill option locks the current gradient to the first shape to which it 
was applied so that subsequent shapes extend the gradient. You’ll want a new 
gradient for the back surface of the coffee cup, so the Lock Fill option should 
be deselected.
9 With the Paint Bucket tool, select the back surface of the coffee cup.
The gradient is applied to the back surface.
Using the gradient transform tool
In addition to choosing colors and positioning the color pointers for a gradient, 
you can adjust the size, direction, or center of a gradient fill. To squeeze the gradi-
ent in the front surface and reverse the gradient in the back surface, you’ll use the 
Gradient Transform tool. 
1 Select the Gradient Transform tool. (The Gradient Transform tool is grouped 
with the Free Transform tool.)
2 Click the front surface of the coffee cup. Transformation handles appear.
3 Drag the square handle on the side of the bounding box inward to squeeze the 
gradient tighter. Drag the center circle to move the gradient to the left so the 
white highlight is positioned slightly left of center.
4 Now click the back surface of the coffee cup. Transformation handles appear.
 Note: To delete a 
color pointer from the 
gradient definition bar, 
simply drag it off the bar.

60 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
5 Drag the round handle on the corner of the bounding box to rotate the gradient 
180 degrees so the gradient fades from dark tan to the left to white to light tan 
on the right. Drag the square handle on the side of the bounding box inward to 
make the gradient tighter.
The coffee cup now has more realism because the shadows and highlights make 
it appear that the front surface is convex and the back surface is concave.
adding a bitmap fill
You’ll make this cup of coffee a little fancier by adding a frothy layer of cream. 
A JPEG image of foam will be used as a bitmap fill. 
1 Select the top surface of the coffee with the Selection tool.
2 Open the Color panel (Window > Color). 
3 Select Bitmap fill.
4 In the Import to Library dialog box, navigate to the 
coffeecream.jpg file in the Lesson02/02Start folder.
5 Select the coffeecream.jpg file and click Open.
The top surface of the coffee fills with the foam image.
The cup of coffee is complete! Rename the layer 
containing your completed drawing coffee cup. All 
that’s left to do is to add some bubbles and hot steam.
 Note: Move the 
center circle to change 
the center of the 
gradient; drag the arrow 
circle to rotate the 
gradient; or drag the 
arrow in the square to 
stretch the gradient.
 Note: You can 
also use the Gradient 
Transform tool to 
change the way a 
bitmap fill is applied.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 61
grouping objects
Now that you’re finished creating your cup of coffee, you can make it into a single 
group. A group holds together a collection of shapes and other graphics to preserve 
their integrity. When grouped, you can move the elements that comprise the coffee 
cup as a unit without worrying that the cup might merge with underlying shapes. 
Use groups to organize your drawing.
1 Select the Selection tool. 
2 Select all the shapes that make up the cup of coffee. 
3 Choose Modify > Group. 
The cup of coffee is now a single group. When you select it, a blue 
outline indicates its bounding box.
4 If you want to change any part of the cup of coffee, double-click 
the group to edit it.
Notice that all the other elements on the Stage dim, and the top horizontal bar 
above the Stage displays Scene 1 Group. This indicates that you are now in a 
particular group and can edit its contents.
5 Click the Scene 1 icon in the horizontal bar at the top of the Stage, or double-
click an empty part of the Stage, and return to the main scene.
Making patterns and Decorations
You can make intricate patterns with the Deco tool (
), which has different 
brushes and configurations. Many options allow you to quickly and easily build 
symmetrical designs, grids, or branching-type flourishes. In this lesson, you’ll use 
the Deco tool to create symmetrical fizzy shapes and dashed lines to give the ban-
ner ad more punch, and floral decorations to adorn the edges.
creating a symbol for a pattern
Before you can use the Deco tool’s symmetry brush, you must create a symbol to 
be used as the base shape that will repeat. You’ll learn more about symbols in the 
next lesson.
1 From the top menu, choose Insert > New Symbol.
 Note: To change 
a group back into its 
component shapes, 
choose Modify > 
Ungroup (Shift+Ctrl+G 
[Windows] or Shift+ 
Command+G [Mac]).

62 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
2 In the Create New Symbol dialog box that appears, enter line for the name and 
choose the Graphic Type symbol. Click OK.
Flash immediately takes you to symbol editing mode. Notice the top horizontal 
bar above the Stage, which indicates you are currently editing the symbol called 
line. You will now draw a line for this symbol.
3 Select the Line tool (
).
4 Select a brown color for the stroke and Hairline for the Stroke Style.
5 Hold down the Shift key while you draw a line across the center of the Stage 
where you see a crosshair representing the center point of your symbol. Make 
the line about 25 pixels high.
 Note: A hairline 
stroke maintains a 
uniform thin thickness 
regardless of how large 
or small you scale it.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 63
6 Click on Scene 1 on the horizontal bar above the Stage to return to the main 
Timeline. Your new symbol called line has been created and is stored in your 
Library panel for later use.
Using the Deco tool symmetry Brush
You’ll create a star shape with the Deco tool.
1 On the Timeline, insert a new layer and name it coffee aroma. You’ll draw your 
symmetrical shapes in this layer.
2 In the toolbar, select the Deco tool (
).
3 In the Properties inspector, under Drawing Effect, choose Symmetry Brush.
4 Click the Edit button next to Module to change the shape that will repeat.
5 In the Select Symbol dialog box, choose the line symbol. Click OK.

64 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
6 Under Advanced Options, choose Rotate Around.
With these Deco tool options, you can create a repeating pattern of the line 
symbol that is symmetrical around a point. A green guide appears on the Stage 
that shows the center point, the main axis, and a secondary axis that determines 
how frequently the symbol is repeated.
7 Click on the Stage to place your symbol and, while keeping your mouse button 
depressed, drag it around the green guides until you get the radial pattern you 
desire. The initial line should be vertical.
8 Drag the secondary green axis closer to the main axis to increase the repetitions.
9 When you’re done, select the Selection tool to exit the Deco tool.
The resulting pattern is a group consisting of a number of line symbols.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 65
aligning objects
Now you’ll create a center bubble for the radiating lines. The bubble should be 
located exactly in the center of the radiating lines, and for that, you can turn to the 
Align panel. The Align panel, as you might guess, aligns any number of selected 
objects horizontally or vertically. It can also distribute objects evenly.
1 Select the Oval tool.
2 Select a brown color for the stroke and no fill. To select no fill, choose the color 
box that has a diagonal red line through it. Select Hairline for Stroke Style.
3 Select the coffee aroma layer. Hold down the Shift key while you draw a small 
circle on the Stage.
4 Now select the Selection tool.
5 Drag the Selection tool over both the star-shaped group and the newly drawn 
oval. You might have to lock the lower layer so you don’t accidentally select the 
shapes in the lower layers.
6 Open the Align panel (Window > Align). 
7 Click the Align horizontal center button.
The star-shaped group and the oval become aligned horizontally.

66 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
8 Click the Align vertical center button.
The star-shaped group and the oval become aligned vertically.
Breaking apart and grouping objects
You used the Deco tool to create the group of radiating lines and the Align panel 
to center the bubble with the lines. Now you’ll group the fizzy shape into a single 
entity. To do so, you’ll break apart the group of radiating lines and regroup them 
with the oval. 
1 With the Selection tool, drag a selection around the entire star so that all the 
lines and the circle are selected.
2 Choose Modify > Break Apart.
The group of lines breaks into its component parts and becomes a collection 
of line symbols.
3 Choose Modify > Break Apart one more time.
The collection of line symbols breaks into its component parts and becomes 
a collection of strokes.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 67
4 Choose Modify > Group.
The lines and center circle become a single group.
5 Copy and paste the group to create multiple bubbles just over the coffee cup. 
Use the Transform tool to scale the bubbles to different sizes.
Using the Deco tool Decorated Brush
Now you’ll explore the Deco tool’s Decorated Brush, which creates decorated  
borders and complex line patterns.
1 In the toolbar, select the Deco tool (
).
2 In the Properties inspector, choose the Decorated Brush option.
3 In Advanced Options, select Dashed Line. Choose a dark brown color for the 
Pattern color and leave Pattern size and Pattern width at their default values.

68 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
4 On the Stage, draw several curvy lines above the coffee cup.
The Decorated Brush creates dashed lines giving your coffee cup a little 
more life!
Using the Deco tool Flower Brush
Now you’ll create flower patterns to decorate the borders of the banner ad.
1 In the toolbar, select the Deco tool (
).
2 In the Properties inspector under Drawing Effect, choose the Flower Brush option.
3 In Advanced Options, select Garden flower. Select the Branch option and leave 
the colors and sizes at their default values.
 Note: The Line 
and Pencil tools can 
also create dashed 
lines and different 
line patterns, but they 
can’t make repeated 
complex patterns 
like the Deco tool 
can. In the Properties 
inspector, click the Edit 
Stroke Style button to 
customize the stroke for 
dashed lines.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 69
4 Draw a swooping branch of flowers across the lower portion of the Stage. 
The flowers, leaves, fruits, and branches are generated repeatedly as you move 
your brush over the Stage.
5 If it’s not already chosen, choose the Selection tool. Select all the flowers, leaves, 
fruits, and branches. Choose Modify > Group. 
The flower decorations are combined into a single group so you can move or 
modify them as a unit.
converting Vector art to Bitmap art
Vector art, especially art with complex curves and many shapes like the flowers 
you just created, can be processor-intensive, and can take its toll on mobile devices 
where performance suffers. An option called Convert to Bitmap provides a way to 
turn selected artwork on the Stage into a single bitmap, which can be less taxing 
on the processor. 
Once an object is converted to a bitmap, you can move the object without worrying 
about it merging with underlying shapes. However, the graphics are no longer edit-
able with Flash’s editing tools.
1 Choose the Selection tool. 
2 Click on the group of flowers.

70 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
3 Choose Modify > Convert to Bitmap.
The flowers become a bitmap and the bitmap is stored in the Library panel.
creating curves
You’ve used the Selection tool to pull and push on the edges of shapes to intuitively 
make curves. For more precise control, you can use the Pen tool (
).
Using the pen tool
Now you’ll create a soothing, wave-like background graphic.
1 Choose Insert > Timeline > Layer, and name the new layer dark brown wave.
2 Drag the layer to the bottom of the layer stack.
3 Lock all the other layers. 
4 In the Tools panel, select the Pen tool (
).
5 Set the Stroke color to dark brown.
6 Begin your shape by clicking on the Stage to establish the first anchor point.
7 Click on another part of the Stage to indicate the next anchor point in your 
shape. When you want to create a smooth curve, click and drag with the 
Pen tool.
A handle appears from the anchor point, indicating the curvature of the line.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 71
8 Continue clicking and dragging to build the outline of the wave. Make the wave 
wider than the Stage.
9 Close your shape by clicking on the first anchor point. Don’t worry about 
making all the curves perfect. It takes practice to get used to the Pen tool. You’ll 
also have a chance to refine your curves in the next part of the lesson.
10 Select the Paint Bucket tool.
11 Set the Fill color to a dark brown.
12 Click inside the outline you just created to fill it with color and delete the stroke.

72 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
Editing curves with the selection and subselection tools
Your first try at creating smooth waves probably won’t be very good. Use the 
Selection tool or the Subselection tool to refine your curves. 
1 Choose the Selection tool.
2 Hover over a line segment and look at the curve that appears near your  
cursor. This indicates that you can edit the curve. If a corner appears near  
your cursor, this indicates that you can edit the vertex.
3 Drag the curve to edit its shape. 
4 In the Tools panel, select the Subselection tool (
).
5 Click on the outline of the shape.
6 Drag the anchor points to new locations or move the handles to refine the 
overall shape.
Deleting or adding anchor points
Use the hidden tools under the Pen tool to delete or add anchor points as needed.
1 Press and hold on the Pen tool to access the hidden tools under it.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 73
2 Select the Delete Anchor Point tool (
).
3 Click on an anchor point on the outline of the shape to delete it. 
4 Select the Add Anchor Point tool (
).
5 Click on the curve to add an anchor point.
creating transparencies
Next, you’ll create a second wave to overlap the first wave. You’ll make the sec-
ond wave slightly transparent to create more overall depth. Transparency can be 
applied to either the stroke or the fill. Transparency is measured as a percentage 
and is referred to as alpha. An alpha of 100% indicates that a color is totally opaque, 
whereas an alpha of 0% indicates that a color is totally transparent.
Modifying the alpha value of a fill
1 Select the shape in the dark brown wave layer.
2 Choose Edit > Copy.
3 Choose Insert > Timeline > Layer and name the new layer light brown wave.
4 Choose Edit > Paste in Place (Ctrl/Command+Shift+V).
The Paste in Place command puts the copied item in the exact same position 
from where it was copied.
5 Choose the Selection tool and move the pasted shape slightly to the left or to 
the right so the crests of the waves are somewhat offset. 

74 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
6 Select the fill of the shape in the light brown wave layer.
7 In the Color panel (Window > Color), set the fill color to a slightly different 
brown hue (CC6666), and then change the Alpha value to 50%.
The color swatch at the bottom of the Color panel previews your newly selected 
color. Transparencies are indicated by the gray grid that can be seen through 
the transparent color swatch.
Matching the color of an existing object
If you want to match a color exactly, you can use the Eyedropper tool (
) to 
sample a fill or a stroke. After you click on a shape with the Eyedropper tool, Flash 
automatically provides you with the Paint Bucket tool or the Ink Bottle tool with 
the selected color and associated properties that you can apply to another object.
1 In the Tools panel, choose the Eyedropper tool.
2 Click on the fill of the shape in the dark brown wave layer.
Your tool automatically changes to the Paint Bucket with the sampled fill color.
 Note: You can 
also change the 
transparency of a shape 
from the Properties 
inspector by clicking 
the Fill Color icon and 
changing the Alpha 
value in the pop-up 
color menu.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 75
3 Click on the shape in the light brown wave layer.
The fill in the light brown wave layer changes to match that of the one in the 
dark brown wave layer. Undo this step to return to the two different colored 
wave shapes.
creating and Editing text
Finally, let’s add text to complete this illustration. Flash has two text options, 
Classic Text and a more advanced text engine called Text Layout Framework (TLF) 
Text. You’ll learn more about TLF Text in Lesson 7. For this project, you’ll use the 
simpler Classic Text option.
When you create static text on the Stage and publish your project, Flash automati-
cally includes all the necessary fonts to display the text correctly. That means you 
don’t have to worry about your audience having the required fonts to see the text 
as you intended it. 
Using the text tool
1 Select the top layer.
2 Choose Insert > Timeline > Layer and name the new layer text.
3 Choose the Text tool (
).
4 In the Properties inspector, select Classic Text and choose Static Text.

76 
Lesson 2 Working with Graphics
5 Under the Character options, choose a font, style, size, and color.
6 Under the Paragraph options, you have additional choices for formatting the 
text such as justification or spacing. Choose values there or accept the defaults.
7 Click on the Stage and begin typing. Enter Garden Court Cafe Taste the 
Difference. Alternately, you can click and drag out a text box to define the 
maximum width of your text.
8 Exit the Text tool by choosing the Selection tool.

review Questions
1 What are the three drawing modes in Flash, and how do they differ?
2 How can you draw a perfect circle using the Oval tool?
3 When would you use each of the selection tools in Flash?
4 What does the Align panel do?
review answers
1 The three drawing modes are Merge Drawing mode, Object Drawing mode, and 
Primitive Drawing mode. 
• In Merge Drawing mode, shapes drawn on the Stage merge to become a single shape. 
• In Object Drawing mode, each object is distinct and remains separate, even when it 
overlaps another object.
• In Primitive Drawing mode, you can modify the angles, radius, or corner radius of 
an object.
2 To draw a perfect circle, hold down the Shift key as you drag the Oval tool on the Stage. 
3 Flash includes three selection tools: the Selection tool, the Subselection tool, and the 
Lasso tool. 
• Use the Selection tool to select an entire shape or object. 
• Use the Subselection tool to select a specific point or line in an object.
• Use the Lasso tool to draw a freeform selection area. 
4 The Align panel aligns any number of selected elements horizontally or vertically and 
can distribute elements evenly.

Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
getting Started
Start by viewing the final project to see what you’ll be creating as you learn to work 
with symbols. 
1 Double-click the 03End.html file in the Lesson03/03End folder to view the final 
project in your browser. 
The project is a static illustration of a cartoon frame. In this lesson, you’ll use 
Illustrator graphic files, imported Photoshop files, and symbols to create an 
attractive static image with interesting effects. Learning how to work with 
symbols is an essential step to creating any animation or interactivity.
2 Close the 03End.html file. 
3 In Flash, choose File > New. In the New Document dialog box, choose 
ActionScript 3.0.
4 On the right-hand side of the dialog box, change the Stage to 600 pixels wide by 
450 pixels high. Click OK.
5 Choose File > Save. Name the file 03_workingcopy.fla and save it in the 
03Start folder.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 81
importing illustrator Files
As you learned in Lesson 2, you can draw objects in Flash using the Rectangle, 
Oval, and other tools. However, for complex drawings, you may prefer to create the 
artwork in another application. Adobe Flash Professional CS6 supports a variety 
of graphic formats, including Adobe Illustrator files, so you can create original 
artwork in that application and then import it into Flash.
When you import an Illustrator file, you can choose which layers in the file to 
import and how Flash should treat those layers. You’ll import an Illustrator file that 
contains all the characters for the cartoon frame. 
1 Choose File > Import > Import to Stage.
2 Select the characters.ai file in the Lesson03/03Start folder. 
3 Click Open.
4 In the Import to Stage dialog box, make sure the top level “hero” and “robot” 
layers are selected. You can expand the groups below them to see their 
individual drawing paths.
If you want to import only certain layers, you can deselect the layers you want 
to omit.
5 Choose Flash Layers from the Convert layers to menu, and then select Place 
objects at original position. Click OK.

82 
Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
Flash imports the Illustrator graphics, and all the layers from the Illustrator file 
also appear in the Timeline.
about Symbols
A symbol is a reusable asset that you can use for special effects, animation, or 
interactivity. There are three kinds of symbols that you can create: the graphic, but-
ton, and movie clip. Symbols can reduce the file size and download time for many 
animations because they can be reused. You can use a symbol countless times in a 
project, but Flash includes its data only once. 
Symbols are stored in the Library panel. When you drag a symbol to the Stage, 
Flash creates an instance of the symbol, leaving the original in the Library. An 
instance is a copy of a symbol located on the Stage. You can think of the symbol as 
an original photographic negative, and the instances on the Stage as prints of the 
negative. With just a single negative, you can create multiple prints. 
 Note: You can select 
any object displayed in 
your Illustrator file and 
choose to import it as 
a symbol or a bitmap 
image. In this lesson, 
you’ll just import the 
Illustrator graphic and 
take the extra step 
of converting it to a 
symbol so you can see 
the entire process.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 83
Using adobe illustrator with Flash
Flash Professional CS6 can import Illustrator files and automatically recognize layers, frames, and symbols. If 
you’re more familiar with Illustrator, you may find it easier to design layouts in Illustrator, and then import them 
into Flash to add animation and interactivity.
Save your Illustrator artwork in Illustrator AI format, and then choose File > Import > Import To Stage or File > 
Import > Import To Library to import the artwork into Flash. Alternatively, you can even copy artwork from 
Illustrator and paste it into a Flash document.
importing layers
When an imported Illustrator file contains layers, you can import them in any of the following ways:
• 
Convert Illustrator layers to Flash layers
• 
Convert Illustrator layers to Flash keyframes
• 
Convert each Illustrator layer to a Flash graphic symbol
• 
Convert all Illustrator layers to a single Flash layer
importing Symbols
Working with symbols in Illustrator is similar to working with them in Flash. In fact, you can use many of the 
same symbol keyboard shortcuts in both Illustrator and Flash: Press F8 in either application to create a sym-
bol. When you create a symbol in Illustrator, the Symbol Options dialog box lets you name the symbol and set 
options specific to Flash, including the symbol type (such as movie clip) and registration point location. 
If you want to edit a symbol in Illustrator without disturbing anything else, double-click the symbol to edit it in 
isolation mode. Illustrator dims all other objects on the artboard. When you exit isolation mode, the symbol in 
the Symbols panel—and all instances of the symbol—are updated accordingly.
Use the Symbols panel or the Control panel in Illustrator to assign names to symbol instances, break links 
between symbols and instances, swap a symbol instance with another symbol, or create a copy of the symbol.
Copying and Pasting artwork
When you copy and paste (or drag and drop) artwork between Illustrator and Flash, the Paste dialog box 
appears. The Paste dialog box provides import settings for the Illustrator file you’re copying. You can paste the 
file as a single bitmap object, or you can paste it using the current preferences for AI files. (To change the set-
tings, choose Edit > Preferences [Windows] or Flash > Preferences [Mac].) Just as when you import the file to the 
Stage or the Library panel, when you paste Illustrator artwork, you can convert Illustrator layers to Flash layers.
FXg File Format
The FXG file format is a cross-platform graphics file format that you can also use to easily move your artwork 
between Flash and other Adobe graphics programs such as Illustrator. If you want to export your Flash artwork 
as an FXG file, choose File > Export > Export Image and select Adobe FXG. Import FXG artwork as you would any 
other external file by choosing File > Import > Import To Stage or File > Import > Import To Library.

84 
Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
It’s also helpful to think of symbols as containers. Symbols are simply containers for 
your content. A symbol can contain a JPEG image, an imported Illustrator drawing, 
or a drawing that you created in Flash. At any time, you can go inside your symbol 
and edit it, which means editing or replacing its contents.
Each of the three kinds of symbols in Flash is used for a specific purpose. You can 
tell whether a symbol is a graphic (
), button (
), or movie clip (
) by look-
ing at the icon next to it in the Library panel. 
movie clip symbols
Movie clip symbols are one of the most common, powerful, and flexible of symbols. 
When you create animation, you will typically use movie clip symbols. You can 
apply filters, color settings, and blending modes to a movie clip instance to enhance 
its appearance with special effects.
Also notable is the fact that each movie clip symbol contains its own independent 
Timeline. You can have an animation inside a movie clip symbol just as easily as 
you can have an animation on the main Timeline. This makes very complex anima-
tions possible; for example, a butterfly flying across the Stage can move from left to 
right as well as have its wings flapping independently of its movement.
Most important, you can control movie clips with ActionScript to make them 
respond to the user. For instance, a movie clip can have drag-and-drop behavior.
button symbols
Button symbols are used for interactivity. They contain four unique keyframes that 
describe how they appear when the mouse is interacting with them. However, but-
tons need ActionScript functionality to make them do something.
You can also apply filters, blending modes, and color settings to buttons. You’ll 
learn more about buttons in Lesson 6 when you create a nonlinear navigation 
scheme to allow the user to choose what to see.
graphic symbols
Graphic symbols are the most basic kind of symbol. Although you can use them for 
animation, you’ll rely more heavily on movie clip symbols. 
Graphic symbols are the least flexible symbols, because they don’t support 
ActionScript and you can’t apply filters or blending modes to a graphic symbol. 
However, in some cases when you want an animation inside a graphic symbol to be 
synchronized to the main Timeline, graphic symbols are useful.

Creating Symbols
In the previous lesson, you learned how to create a symbol to be used for the Deco 
tool. In Flash, there are two main ways to create a symbol. The first is to have noth-
ing on the Stage selected, and then choose Insert > New Symbol. Flash will bring 
you to symbol-editing mode where you can begin drawing or importing graphics 
for your symbol. 
The second way is to select existing graphics on the Stage, and then choose 
Modify > Convert to Symbol (F8). Whatever is selected will automatically be placed 
inside your new symbol.
Both methods are valid; which you use depends on your particular workflow 
preferences. Most designers prefer to use Convert to Symbol (F8) because they 
can create all their graphics on the Stage and see them together before making the 
individual components into symbols.
For this lesson, you will select the different parts of the imported Illustrator 
graphic, and then convert the various pieces to symbols. 
1 On the Stage, select the cartoon character in the hero layer.
2 Choose Modify > Convert to Symbol (F8).
3 Name the symbol hero and select Movie Clip for the Type.
4 Leave all other settings as they are. The Registration indicates the registration 
point of your symbol. Leave the registration at the top-left corner.
 Note: When you use 
the command Convert 
to Symbol, you aren’t 
actually “converting” 
anything; rather, you’re 
placing whatever you’ve 
selected inside of 
a symbol.

86 
Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
5 Click OK. The hero symbol appears in the Library.
6 Select the other cartoon character in the robot layer and convert it to a movie 
clip symbol as well. Name it robot.
You now have two movie clip symbols in your Library and an instance of each 
on the Stage as well.
importing Photoshop Files
You’ll import a Photoshop file for the background. The Photoshop file contains 
two layers with a blending effect. A blending effect can create special color mixes 
between different layers. You’ll see that Flash can import a Photoshop file with all 
the layers intact and retain all the blending information as well.
1 Select the top layer in your Timeline.
2 From the top menu, choose File > Import > Import to Stage.
3 Select the background.psd file in the Lesson03/03Start folder. 
4 Click Open.
5 In the Import to Stage dialog box, make sure all layers are selected. A check 
mark should appear in the check box next to each layer.
6 Choose the flare layer in the left window.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 87
7 In the import options on the right, choose Bitmap image with editable layer styles.
The movie clip symbol icon appears to the right of the Photoshop layer, 
indicating that the imported layer will be made into a movie clip symbol. The 
other option, Flattened bitmap image, will not preserve any layer effects such as 
transparencies or blending.
8 In the left window, choose the Background layer.
9 In the import options on the right, choose Bitmap image with editable layer styles.
10 At the bottom of the dialog box, set the Convert layers to Flash Layers option, 
and select Place layers at original position.
You also have the option of changing the Flash Stage size to match the 
Photoshop canvas. However, the current Stage is already set to the correct 
dimensions (600 pixels x 450 pixels).

88 
Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
11 Click OK. The two Photoshop layers are imported into Flash and placed on 
separate layers on the Timeline.
The Photoshop images are automatically converted into movie clip symbols 
and saved in your Library. All the blending and transparency information is 
preserved. If you select the image in the flare layer, you’ll see that the Blending 
option is set to Lighten in the Properties inspector under the Display section.
12 Drag the robot and the hero layers to the top of the Timeline so they overlap the 
background layers.
 Note: If you want to edit your Photoshop files, you don’t have to go through the entire import 
process again. You can edit any image on the Stage or in the Library panel in Adobe Photoshop or 
any other image-editing application. Right-click/Ctrl-click an image on the Stage or an image in the 
Library and choose Edit with Adobe Photoshop to edit in Photoshop, or select another Edit with 
the option to choose your preferred application. Flash launches the application, and once you have 
saved your changes, your image is immediately updated in Flash.
editing and managing Symbols
You now have multiple movie clip symbols in your Library and several instances 
on the Stage. You can better manage the symbols in your Library by organizing 
them in folders. You can also edit any symbol at any time. If you decide you want 
to change the color of one of the robot’s arms, for example, you can easily go into 
symbol-editing mode and make that change.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 89
about image Formats
Flash supports multiple image formats for import. Flash can handle JPEG, GIF, PNG, 
and PSD (Photoshop) files. Use JPEG files for images that include gradients and 
subtle variations, such as those that occur in photographs. GIF files are used for 
images with large solid blocks of color or black and white line drawings. Use PNG 
files for images that include transparency. Use PSD files if you want to retain all the 
layer, transparency, and blending information from a Photoshop file.
Converting a bitmap image to a Vector graphic
Sometimes you’ll want to convert a bitmap image to a vector graphic. Flash handles 
bitmap images as a series of colored dots (or pixels); vector graphics are handled 
as a series of lines and curves. This vector information is rendered on the fly, so that 
the resolution of vector graphics is not fixed like a bitmap image. That means you 
can zoom in on a vector graphic and your computer will always display it sharply 
and smoothly. Converting a bitmap image to a vector often has the effect of making 
it look “posterized” because subtle gradations are converted to editable, discrete 
blocks of color, which can be an interesting effect.
To convert a bitmap to a vector, import the bitmap image into Flash. Select the 
bitmap and choose Modify > Bitmap > Trace Bitmap. The options determine how 
faithful of a trace the vector image will be to the original bitmap.
In the following figure, the left image is an original bitmap and the right image is a 
vector graphic.
Exercise caution when using the Trace Bitmap command, because a complicated 
vector graphic is often more memory- and processor-intensive than the original 
bitmap image.

Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
adding folders and organizing the library
1 In the Library panel, right-click/Ctrl-click in an empty space and select New 
Folder. Alternatively, you can click the New Folder button (
) at the bottom 
of the Library panel or from the options menu at the upper-right corner of the 
Library panel.
A new folder is created in your Library.
2 Name the folder characters.
3 Drag the hero and the robot movie clip symbols into the characters folder.
4 You can collapse or expand folders to hide or view their contents and keep your 
Library organized.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 91
editing a symbol from the library
1 Double-click the robot movie clip symbol in the Library. 
Flash takes you to symbol-editing mode. In this mode, you can see the contents 
of your symbol—in this case, the robot on the Stage. Notice on the top horizontal 
bar that you are no longer in Scene 1 but are inside the symbol called robot.
2 Double-click the drawing to edit it. You will need to double-click the drawing 
groups several times to drill down to the individual shape that you want to edit.

92 
Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
3 Choose the Paint Bucket tool. Select a new fill color and apply it to the shape on 
the robot drawing.
4 Click on Scene 1 on the top horizontal bar above the Stage to return to the 
main Timeline.
The movie clip symbol in the Library reflects the changes you made. The instance 
on the Stage also reflects the changes you made to the symbol. All instances of the 
symbol on the Stage will change if you edit the symbol.
 Note: You can 
quickly and easily 
duplicate symbols 
in the Library. Select 
the Library symbol, 
right-click/Ctrl-click, 
and choose Duplicate. 
Or, from the top-right 
Options menu in 
the Library, choose 
Duplicate. An exact 
copy of the selected 
symbol will be created 
in your Library.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 93
editing a symbol in place
You may want to edit a symbol in context with the other objects on the Stage. You 
can do so by double-clicking an instance on the Stage. You’ll enter symbol-editing 
mode, but you’ll also be able to see the symbol’s surroundings. This editing mode is 
called editing in place.
1 Using the Selection tool, double-click the robot movie clip instance on the Stage. 
Flash dims all other objects on the Stage and takes you to symbol-editing mode. 
Notice on the top horizontal bar that you are no longer in Scene 1 but are inside 
the symbol called robot.
2 Double-click the drawing to edit it. You will need to double-click the drawing 
groups several times to drill down to the individual shape that you want to edit.

94 
Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
3 Choose the Paint Bucket tool. Select a new fill color and apply it to the shape on 
the robot drawing.
4 Click on Scene 1 on the top horizontal bar above the Stage to return to the 
main Timeline. You can also just double-click any part of the Stage outside the 
graphic with the Selection tool to return to the next higher group level.
The movie clip symbol in the Library panel reflects the changes you made. The 
instance on the Stage also reflects the changes you made to the symbol. All 
instances of the symbol will change according to the edits you make to the symbol.
breaking apart a symbol instance
If you no longer want an object on the Stage to be a symbol instance, you can use 
the Break Apart command to return it to its original form.
1 Select the robot instance on the Stage. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 95
2 Choose Modify > Break Apart.
Flash breaks apart the robot movie clip instance. What’s left on the Stage is a 
group, which you can break apart further to edit as you please. Undo the Break 
Apart command to return the robot object back to a symbol instance.
Changing the Size and Position of instances
You can have multiple instances of the same symbol on the Stage. Now you’ll add 
a few more robots to create a small robot army. You’ll learn how to change the size 
and position (and even rotation) of each instance individually.
1 Select the robot layer in the Timeline. 
2 Drag another robot symbol from the Library onto the Stage. 
A new instance appears.

96 
Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
3 Choose the Free Transform tool.
Control handles appear around the selected instance.
4 Drag the control handles on the sides of the selection to flip the robot so it is 
facing in the other direction.
5 Drag the control handles on the corner of the selection while holding down the 
Shift key to reduce the size of the robot.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 97
6 Drag a third robot from the Library onto the Stage. With the Free Transform 
tool, flip the robot, resize it, and make it overlap the second robot. 
The robot army is growing!
Using rulers and guides
You may want to be more precise in your placement of your symbol instances. In 
Lesson 1, you learned how to use the X and Y coordinates in the Properties inspector 
to position individual objects. In Lesson 2 you learned to use the Align panel to align 
several objects to each other. Another way to position objects on the Stage is to use 
rulers and guides. Rulers appear on the top and left edge of the Pasteboard to provide 
measurement along the horizontal and vertical axes. Guides are vertical or horizontal 
lines that appear on the Stage but do not appear in the final published movie.
1 Choose View > Rulers (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R/Option+Shift+Command+ R). 
Horizontal and vertical rulers measuring in pixels appear along the top and left 
edges of the Pasteboard. As you move objects on the Stage, tick marks indicate 
the bounding box positions on the rulers.

98 
Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
2 Click the top horizontal ruler and drag a guide onto the Stage. 
A colored line appears on the Stage that you can use as a guide for alignment.
3 Double-click the guide with the Selection tool. 
The Move Guide dialog box appears.
4 Enter 435 as the new pixel value of the guide. Click OK.
The guide is repositioned 435 pixels from the top edge of the Stage.
5 Choose View > Snapping > Snap to Guides and make sure Snap to Guides is 
selected.
Objects will now snap to any guides on the Stage.
6 Drag the robot instance and the hero instance so their bottom edges align with 
the guide. 
Changing the Color effect of instances
The Color Effect option in the Properties inspector allows you to change several 
properties of any instance. These properties include brightness, tint, or alpha.
Brightness controls how dark or light the instance appears, tint controls the over-
all coloring, and alpha controls the level of opacity. Decreasing the alpha value 
decreases the opacity and increases the amount of transparency.
 Note: Choose 
View > Guides > Lock 
Guides to lock your 
guides. This prevents 
you from accidentally 
moving them. Clear 
all guides by choosing 
View > Guides > Clear 
Guides. Change the 
color of the guides and 
the snapping accuracy 
by choosing View > 
Guides > Edit Guides.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 99
Changing the brightness
1 Using the Selection tool, click the smallest robot on the Stage.
2 In the Properties inspector, choose Brightness from the Color Effect Style menu.
3 Drag the Bright slider to -40%.
The robot instance on the Stage becomes darker and appears to recede into the 
distance.

100 
Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
Changing the transparency
1 Select the glowing orb in the flare layer.
2 In the Properties inspector, choose Alpha from the Color Effect Style menu.
3 Drag the Alpha slider to a value of 50%. 
The orb in the flare layer on the Stage becomes more transparent.
Understanding display options
The Display section in the Properties inspector for movie clips offers options for 
controlling the instance’s visibility, blending, and rendering.
Visible option for movie clips
The Visible property makes objects either visible or invisible to the audience. You 
can directly control the Visible property of movie clip instances on the Stage by 
selecting or deselecting the option in the Properties inspector.
 Note: To reset the 
Color Effect of any 
instance, choose None 
from the Style menu.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 101
1 Select the Selection tool. 
2 Select one of the robot movie clip instances on 
the Stage.
3 In the Properties inspector, under the Display 
section, notice that the Visible option is checked 
by default, meaning that the instance is visible.
4 Deselect the Visible check box.
The selected instance becomes invisible.
The instance is present on the Stage, and you can 
still move it to a new position, but the audience 
won’t be able to see it. Use the Visible option 
to turn instances on or off during the course of 
your movie, rather than deleting them entirely. 
You can also use the Visible option to position 
invisible instances on the Stage in order to make 
them visible later on with ActionScript, the coding 
language of Flash.
Check the Visible option to make the robot visible on the Stage again.
blending effects
Blending refers to how the colors of an instance interact with the colors below it. 
You saw how the instance in the flare layer had the Lighten option applied to it 
(carried over from Photoshop), which integrated it more with the instance in the 
Background layer.
There are many kinds of Blending options. Some have surprising results, depending 
on the colors in the instance and the colors in the layers below it. Experiment with 
all the options to understand how they work. The following figure shows some of the 
Blending options and their effects on the robot instance over a blue-black gradient.

Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
export as bitmap
The robots and the hero character in this lesson are movie clip symbols contain-
ing complex vector graphics imported from Illustrator. Vector art, however, can be 
processor-intensive, and can take its toll on performance and playback. A rendering 
option called Export as Bitmap can help. The Export as Bitmap option renders the 
vector art as a bitmap, reducing the performance load. The movie clip remains as 
editable vector graphics in the FLA file, however, so you can still modify the artwork.
1 Select the Selection tool. 
2 Select the hero movie clip instance on the Stage.
3 In the Properties inspector, choose Export as Bitmap for the Render option.
The hero movie clip instance appears as it will be rendered when published. You 
may see a slight “softening” of the illustration because of the rasterization of the art.
4 In the pulldown menu under the Render options, leave the selection as 
Transparent.
The Transparent option renders the background in your movie clip symbol 
as transparent. Alternately, you can choose Opaque and pick a color for the 
background of your movie clip symbol.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 103
applying Filters for Special effects
Filters are special effects that you can apply to movie clip instances. Several filters 
are available in the Filters section of the Properties inspector. Each filter has differ-
ent options that can refine the effect. 
applying a blur filter
You’ll apply a blur filter to some of the instances to help give the scene a greater 
sense of depth.
1 Select the glowing orb in the flare layer.
2 In the Properties inspector, expand the Filters section.
3 Click the Add filter button at the bottom of the Filters section and select Blur. 
The Blur filter appears in the Filters window with options for Blur X and Blur Y.
4 If they aren’t linked already, click the link 
icons next to the Blur X and Blur Y options to 
link the blur effect in both directions.
5 Set the Blur X and Blur Y value to 10 pixels. 
The instance on the Stage becomes blurry, 
helping to give an atmospheric perspective to this scene.
 Note: It’s best to 
keep the Quality setting 
for filters on Low. Higher 
settings are processor-
intensive and can bog 
down performance, 
especially if you’ve 
applied multiple filters. 

104 
Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
more Filter options
At the bottom of the Filters window is a row of options to help you manage and 
apply multiple filters.
The Presets button lets you save a particular filter and its settings so you can apply it 
to another instance. The Clipboard button lets you copy and paste any selected filter. 
The Enable or Disable Filter button lets you see your instance with or without the filter 
applied. The Reset Filter button resets the filter parameters to their default values.
Positioning in 3d Space
You also have the ability to position and animate objects in real three-dimensional 
space. However, objects need to be either movie clip symbols or TLF Text to move 
them in 3D. Two tools allow you to position objects in 3D: the 3D Rotation tool and 
the 3D Translation tool. The Transform panel also provides information for posi-
tion and rotation.
Understanding the 3D coordinate space is essential for successful 3D placement of 
objects. Flash divides space using three axes: the x, y, and z axes. The x axis runs 
horizontally across the Stage with x=0 at the left edge. The y axis runs vertically 
with y=0 at the top edge. The z axis runs into and out of the plane of the Stage 
(toward and away from the viewer) with z=0 at the plane of the Stage.
Changing the 3d rotation of an object
You’ll add some text to your image, but to add a little more interest, you’ll tilt it to 
put it in perspective. Think about the beginning text introduction to the Star Wars
movies, and see if you can achieve a similar effect. 
1 Insert a new layer at the top of the layers stack and rename it text.
2 Choose the Text tool from the Tools panel.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 105
3 In the Properties inspector, choose TLF Text, Read Only, and select a large-
size font with an interesting color that will add some pizzazz. Your font could 
appear a little differently than what’s shown in this lesson, depending on the 
fonts available on your computer.
4 Click on the Stage in your text layer and begin typing your title.
5 To exit the Text tool, select the Selection tool.
6 Choose the 3D Rotation tool (
).
A circular, multicolored target appears on the instance. This is a guide for 
the 3D rotation. It’s useful to think of the guides as lines on a globe. The red 
longitudinal line rotates your instance around the x axis. The green line along 
the equator rotates your instance around the y axis. The circular blue guide 
rotates your instance around the z axis.
7 Click on one of the guides—red for x, green for y, or blue for z—and drag your 
mouse in either direction to rotate your instance in 3D space.
You can also click and drag the outer orange circular guide to freely rotate the 
instance in all three directions.

106 
Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
global vs. local transformations
When you choose the 3D Rotation or 3D Translation tool, be aware of the Global 
Transform option (it appears as a three-dimensional cube) at the bottom of 
the Tools panel. When the Global Transform option is depressed, rotation and 
positioning are relative to the global, or Stage, coordinate system. The 3D display 
over the object that you’re moving shows the three axes in constant position, no 
matter how the object is rotated or moved. Notice in the following image how the 
3D display is always perpendicular to the Stage.
However, when the Global option is turned off (the button is raised), rotation and 
positioning is relative to the object. The 3D display shows the three axes oriented rela-
tive to the object, not the Stage. For example, in the following image, notice that the 3D 
Translation tool shows the z axis pointing out from the rectangle, not from the Stage. 
Changing the 3d position of an object
In addition to changing an object’s rotation in 3D space, you can move it to a spe-
cific point in 3D space. Use the 3D Translation tool, which is hidden under the 3D 
Rotation tool.
1 Choose the 3D Translation tool (
).
2 Click on your text.
A guide appears on the instance. This is a guide for the 3D translation. The red 
guide represents the x axis, the green is the y axis, and the blue is the z axis.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 107
3 Click on one of the guide axes and drag your mouse in either direction to move 
your instance in 3D space. Notice that your text stays in perspective as you 
move it around the Stage.
resetting the rotation and position
If you’ve made a mistake in your 3D transformations and want to reset the position 
and rotation of your instance, you can use the Transform panel.
1 Choose the Selection tool and select the instance that you want to reset.
2 Open the Transform panel by choosing Window > 
Transform.
The Transform panel shows all the values for the x, y, and 
z angles and positions.
3 Click the Remove Transform button in the lower-right 
corner of the Transform panel.
The selected instance returns to its original settings.
Understanding the vanishing point 
and the perspective angle
Objects in 3D space represented on a 2D surface (such as the computer screen) are 
rendered with perspective to make them appear as they do in real life. Correct per-
spective depends on many factors, including the vanishing point and the perspec-
tive angle, both of which can be changed in Flash.
The vanishing point determines where on the horizon parallel lines of a perspective 
drawing converge. Think of railroad tracks and how the parallel tracks converge 
to a single point as they recede into the distance. The vanishing point is usually 
at eye level in the center of your field of view, so the default settings are exactly in 
the middle of the Stage. You can, however, change the vanishing point setting so it 
appears above or below eye level, or to the right or left.
The perspective angle determines how quickly parallel lines converge to the vanish-
ing point. The greater the angle the quicker the convergence, and therefore, the 
more severe and distorted the illustration appears. 
1 Select an object on the Stage that has been moved or rotated in 3D space.

108 
Lesson 3 
Creating and editing symbols
2 In the Properties inspector, expand the 3D Position and View section.
3 Click and drag on the X and Y values of the Vanishing Point to change the 
vanishing point, which is indicated on the Stage by intersecting gray lines.
4 To reset the Vanishing Point to the default values (to the center of the Stage), 
click the Reset button.
5 Click and drag on the Perspective Angle value to change the amount of 
distortion. The greater the angle, the more the distortion.

review Questions
1 What is a symbol, and how does it differ from an instance?
2 Name two ways you can create a symbol.
3 When you import an Illustrator file, what happens if you choose to import layers as 
layers? As keyframes?
4 How can you change the transparency of an instance in Flash?
5 What are the two ways to edit symbols?
review answers
1 A symbol is a graphic, button, or movie clip that you create once in Flash and can then 
reuse throughout your document or in other documents. All symbols are stored in 
your Library panel. An instance is a copy of a symbol located on the Stage.
2  You can create a symbol by choosing Insert > New Symbol, or you can select existing 
objects on the Stage and choose Modify > Convert to Symbol.
3 When you import layers of an Illustrator file into Flash as layers, Flash recognizes the 
layers in the Illustrator document and adds them as separate layers in the Timeline. 
When you import layers as keyframes, Flash adds each Illustrator layer to a separate 
frame in the Timeline and creates keyframes for them. 
4 The transparency of an instance is determined by its alpha value. To change the 
transparency, select Alpha from the Color Effect menu in the Properties inspector, and 
then change the alpha percentage.
5 To edit a symbol, either double-click the symbol in the Library to enter symbol-editing 
mode, or double-click the instance on the Stage to edit it in place. Editing a symbol in 
place lets you see the other objects around the instance.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Animate the position, scale, and rotation of objects
• Adjust the pacing and timing of your animation
• Animate transparency and special effects
• Change the path of an object’s motion
• Create animation inside symbols
• Change the easing of the motion
• Animate in 3D space
This lesson will take approximately two hours to complete. If needed, 
remove the previous lesson folder from your hard drive and copy the 
Lesson04 folder onto it.

Use Flash Professional CS6 to change almost any 
aspect of an object—position, color, transparency, 
size, rotation, and more—over time. Motion tweening 
is the basic technique of creating animation with 
symbol instances.

Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
getting Started
Start by viewing the finished movie file to see the animated title page that you’ll 
create in this lesson. 
1 Double-click the 04End.html file in the Lesson04/04End folder to play the 
animation in a browser.
The project is an animated splash page for an imaginary soon-to-be-released 
motion picture. In this lesson, you’ll use motion tweens to animate several 
components on the page: the cityscape, the main actors, several old-fashioned 
cars, and the main title.
2 Close the 04End.html file.
3 Double-click the 04Start.fla file in the Lesson04/04Start folder to open the initial 
project file in Flash. This file is partially completed and already contains many of 
the graphic elements imported into the Library for you to use.
4 From the view options above the Stage, choose View > Magnification > Fit in 
Window so that you can see the entire Stage on your computer screen.
5 Choose File > Save As. Name the file 04_workingcopy.fla, and save it in the 
04Start folder. 
Saving a working copy ensures that the original start file will be available if you 
want to start over.

About Animation
Animation is the movement, or change, of objects through time. Animation can be 
as simple as moving a box across the Stage from one frame to the next. It can also 
be much more complex. As you’ll see in this lesson, you can animate many different 
aspects of a single object. You can change an object’s position on the Stage, change 
its color or transparency, change its size or its rotation, and even animate the special 
filters that you saw in the previous lesson. You also have control over an object’s path 
of motion, and even its easing, which is the way an object accelerates or decelerates.
In Flash, the basic workflow for animation goes like this: Select an object on the 
Stage, right-click/Ctrl-click, and choose Create Motion Tween. Move the red play-
head to a different point in time and move the object to a new position. Flash takes 
care of the rest.
Motion tweens create animation for changes in position on the Stage and for 
changes in size, color, or other attributes. Motion tweens require you to use a 
symbol instance. If the object you’ve selected is not a symbol instance, Flash will 
automatically ask to convert the selection to a symbol. Flash also automatically 
separates motion tweens on their own layers, which are called Tween layers. There 
can be only one motion tween per layer without any other element in the layer. 
Tween layers allow you to change various attributes of your instance at different 
key points over time. For example, a spaceship could be on the left side of the Stage 
at the beginning keyframe and at the far-right side of the Stage at an ending key-
frame, and the resulting tween would make the spaceship fly across the Stage.
The term “tween” comes from the world of classic animation. Senior animators would 
be responsible for drawing the beginning and ending poses for their characters. The 
beginning and ending poses were the keyframes of the animation. Junior animators 
would then come in and draw the “in-between” frames, or do the “in-betweening.” 
Hence, “tweening” refers to the smooth transitions between keyframes.
Understanding the Project File
The 04Start.fla file contains a few of the animated elements already or partially 
completed. Each of the six layers—man, woman, Middle_car, Right_car, footer, and 
ground—contains an animation. The man and woman layers are in a folder called 
actors, and the Middle_car and Right_car layers are in a folder called cars. 

114 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
You’ll be adding more layers to add an animated cityscape, 
refining the animation of one of the actors, as well as add-
ing a third car and a 3D title. All the necessary graphic 
elements have been imported into the Library panel. The 
Stage is set at a generous 1280 pixels by 787 pixels to fill 
up a high-resolution monitor, and the Stage color is black. 
You might need to choose a different view option to see 
the entire Stage. Choose View > Magnification > Fit in Window from the view 
options at the top-right corner of the Stage to view the Stage at a magnification 
percentage that fits your screen. 
Animating Position
You’ll start this project by animating the 
cityscape. It will begin slightly lower than 
the top edge of the Stage, and then rise 
slowly until its top is aligned with the top 
of the Stage.
1 Lock all the existing layers so you don’t 
accidentally modify them. Create a new 
layer above the footer layer and rename 
it city.
2 Drag the bitmap image called cityBG.jpg from the bitmaps folder in the Library 
panel to the Stage.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 115
3 In the Properties inspector, set the value of X to 0 and the value of Y to 90.
This positions the cityscape image just slightly below the top edge of the Stage.
4 Right-click/Ctrl-click on the cityscape image and choose Create Motion Tween. 
From the top menu, you can also select Insert > Motion Tween.
5 A dialog box appears warning you that your selected object is not a symbol. 
Motion tweens require symbols. Flash asks if you want to convert the selection 
to a symbol so it can proceed with the motion tween. Click OK.
Flash automatically converts your selection to a symbol, which is stored in your 
Library panel. Flash also converts the current layer to a Tween layer so you 
can begin to animate the instance. Tween layers are distinguished by a special 
icon in front of the layer name, and the frames are tinted blue. Tween layers are 
reserved for motion tweens, and hence, no drawing is allowed on a Tween layer.

116 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
6 Move the red playhead to the end of the tween span at frame 190.
7 Select the instance of the cityscape on the Stage, and while holding down the 
Shift key, move the instance up the Stage.
Holding down the Shift key constrains the movement to right angles.
8 For more precision, set the value of Y to 0 in the Properties inspector.
A small black diamond appears in frame 190 at the end of the tween span. This 
indicates a keyframe at the end of the tween. Flash smoothly interpolates the 
change in position from frame 1 to frame 190 and represents that motion with 
a motion path. Hide all the other layers to see the results of the motion tween 
on the cityscape.
9 Drag the red playhead back and forth at the top of the Timeline to see the 
smooth motion. You can also choose Control > Play (Enter) to make Flash play 
the animation.
Animating changes in position is simple, because Flash automatically creates 
keyframes at the points where you move your instance to new positions. If you 
want to have an object move to many different points, simply move the red 
playhead to the desired frame, and then move the object to its new position. 
Flash takes care of the rest.
P Note: Remove a 
motion tween by right-
clicking/Ctrl-clicking 
the motion tween on 
the Timeline or the 
Stage and choosing 
Remove Tween.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 117
Using the Controller to Preview the Animation
The Controller panel allows you to play, rewind, or go step-by-step backward or 
forward through your Timeline to review your animation in a controlled manner.
Choose Window > Toolbars > Controller to display a separate controller panel, 
or use the playback controls that are integrated at the bottom of the Timeline.
1 Click any of the playback buttons on the controller below the Timeline to go 
to the first frame, go to the last frame, play, stop, or move forward or backward 
one frame. 
2 Choose the loop option and click the play button.
The playhead loops, allowing you to see the animation over and over for 
careful analysis.
3 Move the front or rear brackets on the Timeline to define the range of frames 
that you want to see looped.
The playhead loops within the bracketed frames. Click on the loop option again 
to turn it off.
Changing the Pacing and timing
You can change the duration of the entire tween span or change the timing of the 
animation by clicking and dragging keyframes on the Timeline.
Changing the animation duration
If you want the animation to proceed at a slower pace, taking up a much longer 
period of time, you need to lengthen the entire tween span between the beginning 
and end keyframes. If you want to shorten the animation, you need to decrease 
the tween span. Lengthen or shorten a motion tween by dragging the ends on 
the Timeline.

118 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
1 Move your mouse cursor close to the end of the tween span in the city layer.
Your cursor changes to a double-headed arrow, indicating that you can lengthen 
or shorten the tween span.
2 Click and drag the end of the tween span back toward frame 60.
Your motion tween shortens to 60 frames, so now the cityscape takes a much 
shorter time to move. 
3 Move your mouse cursor close to the beginning of the tween span (at frame 1).
4 Click and drag the beginning of the frame span forward to frame 10.
Your motion tween begins at a later time, so it now plays only from frame 10 to 
frame 60. 
P Note: If you have 
multiple keyframes 
in a tween, dragging 
out your tween spans 
will distribute all your 
keyframes uniformly. 
The timing of your 
entire animation 
remains the same; only 
the length changes.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 119
Adding frames
You’ll want the last keyframe of your motion tween to hold for the remainder of the 
animation. Add frames by Shift-dragging the end of a tween span.
1 Move your mouse cursor close to the end of the tween span.
2 Hold down the Shift key and click and drag the end of the tween span forward 
to frame 190.
The last keyframe in the motion tween remains at frame 60, but additional 
frames are added to frame 190.
moving keyframes
When you click on a motion tween on the Timeline, the entire span is selected. 
This allows you to move the entire motion tween forward or backward in time as 
a single unit. However, if you want to move particular keyframes within a motion 
tween to change the pacing of the animation, you have to select individual frames. 
Holding down the Ctrl (Windows)/Command (Mac) key will let you select single 
frames or a span of frames within a motion tween.
1 Ctrl-click/Command-click on the keyframe at frame 60.
Just the keyframe at frame 60 is selected. A tiny box appears next 
to your mouse cursor indicating that you can move the keyframe.
P Note: You can also 
add individual frames 
by choosing Insert > 
Timeline > Frame (F5) 
or remove individual 
frames by choosing 
Edit > Timeline > 
Remove Frames 
(Shift+F5).

120 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
2 Click and drag the keyframe to frame 40.
The last keyframe in the motion tween moves to frame 40, so the motion of the 
cityscape proceeds quicker.
Animating transparency
In the previous lesson, you learned how to change the color effect of any symbol 
instance to change the transparency, tint, or brightness. You can change the color 
effect of an instance in one keyframe and change the value of the color effect in 
another keyframe, and Flash will automatically display a smooth change, just as it 
does with changes in position.
You’ll change the cityscape in the beginning keyframe to be totally transparent 
but keep the cityscape in the ending keyframe opaque. Flash will create a smooth 
fade-in effect.
1 Move the red playhead to the first keyframe of the motion tween (frame 10).
2 Select the cityscape instance on the Stage.
3 In the Properties inspector, choose the Alpha option for Color Effect.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 121
4 Set the Alpha value to 0%.
The cityscape instance on the Stage becomes totally transparent.
P Note: You can also 
apply a Color Effect 
through the Motion 
Editor, as explained later 
in this lesson. Click the 
Motion Editor tab next 
to the Timeline. Click the 
plus sign next to Color 
Effect and select Alpha.

122 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
5 Move the red playhead to the last keyframe of the motion tween (frame 40).
6 Select the cityscape instance on the Stage.
7 In the Properties inspector, under Color Effect, set the Alpha value to 100%.
The cityscape instance on the Stage becomes totally opaque.
8 Preview the effect by choosing Control > Play (Enter).
Flash interpolates the changes in both position and transparency between the 
two keyframes.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 123
Animating Filters
Filters, which give instances special effects such as blurs and drop shadows, can 
also be animated. You’ll refine the motion tween of the actors next by apply-
ing a blur filter to one of them to make it appear as if the camera changes focus. 
Animating filters is no different from animating changes in position or changes in 
color effect. You simply set the values for a filter at one keyframe and set different 
values for the filter at another keyframe, and Flash creates a smooth transition.
1 Make the actors layer folder on the Timeline visible.
2 Lock all the layers on the Timeline except the woman layer.
3 Move the red playhead to the beginning keyframe of the motion tween in the 
woman layer—at frame 23.
4 Select the instance of the woman on the Stage. 
You won’t be able to see her because she has an 
alpha value of 0% (totally transparent), but if 
you click on the top-right side of the Stage, the 
transparent instance will be selected.
5 In the Properties inspector, expand the Filters 
section.
6 Click the Add filter button at the bottom of the 
Filters section and select Blur.

124 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
The Blur filter is applied to the instance.
7 In the Filters section of the Properties inspector, 
click the link icon to constrain the blur values to 
both the x and y directions equally. Set the X and 
Y Blur values to 20 pixels.
8 Move the red playhead across the entire Timeline 
to preview the animation.
The 20-pixel Blur filter is applied to the woman instance throughout the 
motion tween.
9 Position the playhead at frame 140 and right-click/Ctrl-click on the woman 
layer there. Then choose Insert Keyframe > Filter.
A keyframe for filters is established at frame 140.
P Note: You can also 
apply a Filter through 
the Motion Editor, as 
explained later in this 
lesson. Click the Motion 
Editor tab next to the 
Timeline. Click the plus 
sign next to Filters and 
select Blur.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 125
10 Move the red playhead to frame 160.
11 Select the instance of the woman on the Stage.
12 In the Properties inspector, change the value of the Blur filter to X=0 and Y=0.
The Blur filter changes from the keyframe at frame 140 to the keyframe at 160. 
Flash creates a smooth transition from a blurry instance to an in-focus instance.

126 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
Understanding Property Keyframes 
Changes in properties are independent of one another and do not need to be tied to the same keyframes. That 
is, you can have a keyframe for position, a different keyframe for the color effect, and yet another keyframe for a 
filter. Managing many different kinds of keyframes can become overwhelming, especially if you want different 
properties to change at different times during the motion tween. Fortunately, Flash Professional CS6 provides a 
few helpful tools for keyframe management.
When viewing the tween span, you can choose to view 
the keyframes of only certain properties. For example, 
you can choose to view only the position keyframes 
to see when your object moves. Or, you can choose to 
view only the filter keyframes to see when there is a 
filter change. Right-click/Ctrl-click on a motion tween 
in the Timeline, choose View Keyframes, and then 
select the desired property among the list. You can also 
choose All or None to see all the properties or none of 
the properties.
When inserting a keyframe, you can also insert a 
keyframe specific to the property you want to change. 
Right-click/Ctrl-click on a motion tween in the 
Timeline, choose Insert Keyframes, and then select 
the desired property.
The Motion Editor is a special panel that displays all the 
properties of your motion tween visually as lines on a 
graph. The Motion Editor is helpful when multiple prop-
erties are changing at different times. For example, the 
Motion Editor for the woman is shown in the screenshot 
below, and shows changes in the x-position and Alpha 
values in the first few frames, and changes in the Blur 
filter in the last few frames. 
You’ll learn more about how to use the Motion Editor later in this lesson. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 127
Animating transformations
Now you’ll learn how to animate changes in scale or 
rotation. These kinds of changes are made with the 
Free Transform tool or with the Transform panel. 
You’ll add a third car to the project. The car will start 
small, and then become larger as it appears to move 
forward toward the viewer.
1 Lock all the layers on the Timeline.
2 Insert a new layer inside the Cars folder and 
rename it Left_car. 
3 Select frame 75 and insert a new keyframe (F6).
4 Drag the movie clip symbol called carLeft from the Library panel to the Stage 
at frame 75.
5 Select the Free Transform tool.
The transformation handles appear around the instance on the Stage.

128 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
6 While holding down the Shift key, click and drag the corner handle inward to 
make the car smaller.
7 In the Properties inspector, make sure that the width of the car is about 400 pixels.
8 Alternatively, you can use the Transform panel (Window > Transform) and 
change the scale of the car to about 29.4%.
9 Move the car to its starting position at about X=710 and Y=488.
10 In the Properties inspector, select Alpha for the Color Effect.
11 Set the value of the Alpha to 0%.
The car becomes totally transparent.
12 Right-click/Ctrl-click on the car on the Stage and select Create Motion Tween.
The current layer becomes a Tween layer.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 129
13 Move the red playhead on the Timeline to frame 100.
14 Select the transparent instance of the car, and in the Properties inspector, 
change the Alpha value to 100%.
A new keyframe is automatically inserted at frame 100 to indicate the change in 
transparency.
15 Select the Free Transform tool if it’s not already selected.
16 While holding down the Shift key, click and drag the corner handle outward to 
make the car larger. For more precision, use the Properties inspector and set the 
dimensions of the car to width=1379.5 pixels and height=467.8 pixels.
17 Position the car at X=607 and Y=545.

130 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
18 Move the Left_car layer in between the Middle_car and Right_car layers so that 
the car in the center overlaps the cars on the side.
Flash tweens the change in position and the change in scale from frame 75 
to frame 100. Flash also tweens the change in transparency from frame 75 to 
frame 100.
motion Presets
If your project involves creating identical motion tweens repeatedly, Flash 
provides a panel called Motion Presets that can help. The Motion Presets panel 
(Window > Motion Presets) can store any motion tween so you can apply it to 
different instances on the Stage.
For example, if you want to build a slide show where each image fades out in the 
same manner, you can save that transition to the Motion Presets panel. 
1 
Select the first motion tween on the Timeline or the instance on the Stage.
2 
In the Motion Presets panel, click the Save selection as preset button at the 
bottom of the panel.
3 
Name your motion preset, and it will be saved in the Motion Presets panel.
4 
Select a new instance on the Stage and choose the motion preset.
5 
Click Apply and your saved motion preset will be applied to the new instance.
Flash provides a number of motion presets that you can use to quickly build 
sophisticated animations without much effort. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 131
Changing the Path of the motion
The motion tween of the left car that you just 
animated shows a colored line with dots indicating 
the path of the motion. The path of the motion can 
be edited easily so that the car travels in a curve, or 
the path can be moved, scaled, or even rotated just 
like any other object on the Stage. 
To better demonstrate how you can edit the path of 
the motion, open the sample file 04MotionPath.fla  
in the 04Start folder. The file contains a single 
Tween layer with a rocket ship moving from the 
top left of the Stage to the bottom right.
moving the path of the motion
You will move the path of the motion so the relative movement of the rocket ship 
remains the same but its starting and ending positions change.
1 Choose the Selection tool.
2 Click on the path of the motion to select it.
The path of the motion becomes highlighted when it is selected.

132 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
3 Click and drag the motion path to move it to a different place on the Stage.
The relative motion and timing of the animation remain the same, but the 
starting and ending positions are relocated.
Changing the scale or rotation of the path
The path of the motion can also be manipulated with the Free Transform tool.
1 Select the path of the motion.
2 Choose the Free Transform tool.
Transformation handles appear around the path of the motion.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 133
3 Scale or rotate the path of the motion as desired. You can make the path smaller 
or larger, or rotate the path so the rocket ship starts from the bottom left of the 
Stage and ends at the top right.
Editing the path of the motion
Making your objects travel on a curved path is a simple matter. You can either edit 
the path with Bézier  precision using anchor point handles, or you can edit the path 
in a more intuitive manner with the Selection tool.
1 Choose the Convert Anchor Point tool, which is 
hidden under the Pen tool.
2 Click on the starting point or the ending point 
of the motion path on the Stage and drag the 
control handle out from the anchor point.
The handle on the anchor point controls the curvature of the path.

134 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
3 Choose the Subselection tool.
4 Click and drag the handle to edit the curve of the path. Make the rocket ship 
travel in a wide curve.
P Note: The path of 
the motion can also be 
directly manipulated 
with the Selection tool. 
Choose the Selection 
tool and move it close 
to the path of the 
motion. A curved icon 
appears next to your 
cursor indicating that 
you can edit the path. 
Click and drag the path 
of the motion to change 
its curvature. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 135
orienting objects to the path
Sometimes the orientation of the object traveling along the path is important. In 
the motion picture splash page project, the orientation of the car is constant as 
it rumbles forward. However, in the rocket ship example, the rocket ship should 
follow the path with its nose pointed in the direction in which it is heading. The 
Orient to path option in the Properties inspector gives you this option.
1 Select the motion tween on the Timeline.
2 In the Properties inspector, under Rotation, select the Orient to path option.
Flash inserts keyframes for rotation along the motion tween so that the nose of 
the rocket ship is oriented to the path of the motion.
P Note: To direct the 
nose of the rocket ship, 
or any other object, 
along the path of its 
motion, you must 
orient its position so 
that it is facing in the 
direction that you want 
it to travel. Use the 
Free Transform tool to 
rotate its initial position 
so that it is oriented 
correctly.

136 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
Swapping tween targets
The motion tween model in Flash Professional CS6 is object based. This means 
that an object and its motion are independent of each other, and you can easily 
swap out the target of a motion tween. If, for example, you’d rather see an alien 
moving around the Stage instead of a rocket ship, you can replace the target of 
the motion tween with an alien symbol from your Library panel and still preserve 
the animation.
1 Select the rocket ship on the Stage to select the motion tween.
2 Drag the movie clip symbol of the alien from the Library panel onto the 
rocket ship.
Flash asks you if you want to replace the existing tween target object with a 
new object.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 137
3 Click OK.
Flash replaces the rocket ship with the alien. The motion remains the same, but 
the target of the motion tween has been swapped.
Creating nested Animations
Often, an object that is animated on the Stage will have its own animation. For 
example, a butterfly moving across the Stage will have an animation of its wings 
flapping as it moves. Or the alien that you swapped with the rocket ship could be 
waving his arms. These kinds of animations are called nested animations, because 
they are contained inside the movie clip symbols. Movie clip symbols have their 
own Timeline that is independent of the main Timeline.
In this example, you’ll make the alien wave his arms inside the movie clip symbol, 
so he’ll be waving as he moves across the Stage.
Creating animations inside movie clip symbols
1 In the Library panel, double-click the 
alien movie clip symbol icon.
You are now in symbol-editing mode 
for the alien movie clip symbol. The 
alien is in the middle of the Stage. In 
the Timeline, the parts of the alien 
are separated in layers.
2 Choose the Selection tool.
P Note: You can also 
swap instances in the 
Properties inspector. 
Select the object that 
you want to swap 
on the Stage. In the 
Properties inspector, 
click the Swap button. 
In the dialog box 
that appears, choose 
a new symbol and 
click OK. Flash will 
swap the target of the 
motion tween. 

138 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
3 Right-click/Ctrl-click on the alien’s left arm and choose Create Motion Tween.
Flash converts the current layer to a Tween layer and inserts one second worth 
of frames so you can begin to animate the instance. 
4 Choose the Free Transform tool.
5 Drag the corner rotation control points to rotate the 
arm upward to the alien’s shoulder height.
A keyframe is inserted at the end of the motion tween. 
The right arm rotates smoothly from the resting 
position to the outstretched position.
6 Move the red playhead back to frame 1.
7 Now create a motion tween for the alien’s other arm. Right-click/Ctrl-click on 
his right arm and choose Create Motion Tween.
Flash converts the current layer to a Tween layer and inserts one second worth 
of frames so you can begin to animate the instance. 
8 Choose the Free Transform tool.
9 Drag the corner rotation control points to rotate the 
arm upward to the alien’s shoulder height.
A keyframe is inserted at the end of the motion tween. 
The arm rotates smoothly from the resting position to 
the outstretched position.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 139
10 Select the last frame in all the other layers and insert frames (F5) so that the 
head, body, and feet all remain on the Stage for the same amount of time as 
the moving arms.
11 Exit symbol-editing mode by clicking the Scene 1 button at the top left of 
the Stage.
Your animation of the alien raising his arms is complete. Wherever you use the 
movie clip symbol, the alien will continue to play its nested animation.
12 Preview the animation by choosing Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
Flash opens a window showing the exported animation. The alien moves along 
the motion path while the nested animation of his arms moving plays and loops.
P Note: Animations 
inside of movie clip 
symbols won’t play 
on the main timeline. 
Choose Control > 
Test Movie > in Flash 
Professional to preview 
nested animations.
P Note: Animations 
inside movie clip 
symbols will loop 
automatically. To 
prevent the looping, 
you need to add 
ActionScript to tell the 
movie clip Timeline to 
stop on its last frame. 
You’ll learn more about 
ActionScript in Lesson 6, 
“Creating Interactive 
Navigation.”

Using the motion Editor
The Motion Editor panel provides in-depth information and editing capabilities 
for all the properties of a motion tween. The Motion Editor is located behind the 
Timeline and can be accessed by clicking the top tab or by choosing Window > 
Motion Editor. The animated object on the Stage or the tween on the Timeline 
must be selected in order for the Motion Editor to display its information.
On the left side of the Motion Editor, an expandable list of properties is displayed 
along with those properties’ values and easing options. On the right side, a timeline 
shows various lines and curves representing how those properties change. 
Setting the motion Editor display options
Options for displaying the Motion Editor are listed at the bottom of the panel.
1 Select the alien on the Stage.
2 Open the Motion Editor panel if it is not already visible.
3 Move your cursor over the gray horizontal bar 
separating the Motion Editor from the Stage.
Your cursor changes to a double-headed arrow 
indicating that you can increase or decrease the height 
of the Motion Editor panel.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 141
4 Click and drag the horizontal bar to increase the height of the Motion Editor panel.
5 Click the triangles to collapse all the properties categories on the left. You 
can expand or collapse the categories to see only those categories you are 
interested in.
6 Click and drag the number next to the Viewable Frames icon at the bottom of 
the Motion Editor to change the number of frames that appear in the graph. Set 
the Viewable Frames value to the maximum to see the entire motion tween.
7 Click and drag the number next to the Graph Size icon at the bottom of the 
Motion Editor to change the vertical height of each property that is listed on 
the left.

142 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
8 Click and drag the number next to the Expanded Graph Size icon at the bottom 
of the Motion Editor to change the vertical height of each selected property.
To see how the Expanded Graph Size option affects the display, click the X 
property under Basic motion. The larger the Expanded Graph Size value, the 
more of the selected property you can view.
Changing property values
You will change another property of your flapping alien with the Motion Editor and 
see how easy it is to animate multiple properties independently. For this example, 
you’ll create a fade-in effect by changing the Alpha property.
1 Next to the Color Effect property, click the Plus icon and choose Alpha.
The Alpha property appears in the Motion Editor under the Color Effect category.
2 Select the Alpha amount.
The Alpha property expands, displaying a black-dotted horizontal line at 100% 
extending from frame 1 to the end of the timeline. This line represents the 
opacity of the alien throughout the motion tween.
3 Click on the first keyframe, which is indicated by a black square, and drag it 
down to 0%. You can also change the Alpha value by clicking and dragging the 
value next to the Alpha amount.

inserting keyframes
Inserting keyframes is easy. 
1 In the Motion Editor, move the red playhead to frame 20.
2 Click the diamond icon to add a keyframe at that point in time for the 
Alpha property. You can also right-click/Ctrl-click on the graph and choose 
Insert Keyframe.
A new keyframe for the Alpha property is inserted at frame 20 indicated by a 
black square on the graph.

144 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
3 Click on the second keyframe.
The selected keyframe becomes highlighted.
4 Drag the second keyframe up to change the Alpha value to 100%.
Flash animates the smooth transition of transparency from frame 1 to frame 20.
Editing keyframes
You can easily navigate keyframes and remove them, and you can move keyframes 
to control the precise timing of each of your transitions.
• Click the left or right arrow beside the diamond-shaped icon to move quickly 
between keyframes.
• Right-click/Ctrl-click on any keyframe and choose Remove Keyframe to delete 
a keyframe.
• Select a keyframe and click the yellow diamond to delete the keyframe.
• Shift-click to select multiple contiguous keyframes and move them together.
Resetting values and deleting properties
If you’ve made a mistake in setting a property, you can easily reset its value or 
delete it from the Motion Editor entirely so the property won’t be animated.
1 Click the Reset Values button to reset the property to its default values.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 145
2 Click the Minus button and select Alpha to delete the property from the 
Motion Editor.
Choose Edit > Undo (Ctrl-Z/Cmd-Z) to restore the Alpha property because 
you’ll be working with it in the next section.
Easing
Easing refers to the way in which a motion tween proceeds. In the most basic sense, 
it can be thought of as acceleration or deceleration. An object that moves from one 
side of the Stage to the other side can start off slowly, then build up momentum, 
and then stop suddenly. Or, the object can start off quickly, and then gradually 
come to a halt. But easing can also be more complicated. It can describe motion 
that oscillates, bounces, and does other complex patterns. Your keyframes still indi-
cate the beginning and end points of the motion, but the easing determines how 
your object gets from one keyframe to the next.
Easing is best visualized in the Motion Editor. The graphs that connect one key-
frame to another are usually straight lines, which indicate that the change from 
one value to the next value proceeds linearly. However, if you want a more gradual 
change from the starting position (known as an ease-in), the line would be curved 
near the beginning keyframe, indicating a slower start. A gradual slowdown 
(known as an ease-out) would be represented by a curve near the ending keyframe.

146 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
Setting eases of a motion tween
You can create an ease by customizing the curvature of the property graph in the 
Motion Editor.
1 In the Motion Editor, right-click/Ctrl-click the second keyframe in the Alpha 
property and choose Smooth point.
Control handles appear from the keyframe, which you can move to change the 
curvature of the line.
2 Click and drag the control handle to create a smooth curve approaching the 
100% Alpha value.
The transition from 0% to 100% Alpha slows down as it approaches 100% 
(ease-out).

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 147
3 Right-click/Ctrl-click the first keyframe in the Alpha property and choose 
Smooth point.
Control handles appear from the keyframe, which you can move to change the 
curvature of the line.
4 Click and drag the control handle to create a smooth curve as the line begins 
from 0%.
The transition from 0% to 100% Alpha begins 
gradually from 0% in addition to slowing down. 
The total effect of the S-shaped curve is both an 
ease-in and an ease-out effect.
P Note: You can also apply ease-in and ease-out effects from 
the Properties inspector. In the Timeline (not the Motion Editor), 
select the motion tween. In the Properties inspector, enter an 
easing value between –100 (ease-in) to 100 (ease-out).
P Note: Easing values applied via the Properties inspector will 
be applied globally to all the properties throughout the entire 
motion tween. With the Motion Editor, you have precise control 
over individual properties and eases between keyframes.

148 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
Using preset eases
Easing can be very powerful and can be used to create many specialized motions. 
For example, a bouncing motion can be created with just two positional keyframes 
and an ease that moves the object back and forth between the two positions.
For the next example, you’ll return to the motion picture project and add a preset 
ease to the motion of the car. You’ll make the car shudder up and down to mimic 
the motion of an idling car. The motion tween will be created inside the movie clip 
symbol of the car.
1 Continue with your Flash project in progress, 04_workingcopy.fla.
2 In the Library panel, double-click the movie clip symbol called carLeft.
Flash takes you to symbol-editing mode for the movie clip symbol. Two layers 
are inside this symbol: the top layer called lights, and the bottom layer called 
smallRumble.
3 Lock the top lights layer.
4 Right-click/Ctrl-click on the car and choose Create Motion Tween.
Flash converts the current layer to a Tween layer so you can begin to animate 
the instance. 
5 Move the red playhead to the end of the Timeline.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 149
6 Choose the Selection tool.
7 Move the car down about 5 pixels.
Flash creates a smooth animation of the car moving down slightly. 
8 Click on the motion tween in the Timeline and open the Motion Editor.
9 Click the Plus icon on the Eases category and choose Random.
The Random preset ease appears.

150 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
10 Select the Random ease.
The Random ease jumps from one value to the next in random intervals. This is 
shown graphically as a series of abrupt stair steps.
11 Change the Random value to 15.
The frequency of random jumps increases based on the Random value.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 151
12 Select the Basic motion category. 
13 In the Ease pull-down menu next to the Basic motion category, choose 
2-Random.
Flash applies the Random ease to the positional changes of the motion tween. 
Instead of a smooth change in the y-position, Flash makes the car jerk up and 
down randomly between the values of the keyframes, simulating a rumbling, 
idling car. Since the animation is nested in a movie clip, choose Control > Test 
Movie > in Flash Professional to preview the motion.
Classic tween model
In previous versions of Flash Professional (CS3 and earlier), 
motion tweens were created by first establishing keyframes 
in the Timeline, then changing one or more of the properties 
of the instance, and then applying a motion tween between 
the two keyframes. If you’re more comfortable working with 
this older way of animating, you can do so by relying on the 
Classic Tween option. 
Select the first keyframe containing your instance, and then choose Insert > Classic 
Tween. Flash applies a classic motion tween to your Timeline. 
The Motion Editor is not available for classic tweens.

152 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
Animating 3d motion
Finally, you’ll add a title and animate it in 3D space. Animating in 3D presents 
the added complication of a third (z) axis. When you choose the 3D Rotation or 
3D Translation tool, you need to be aware of the Global Transform option at the 
bottom of the Tools panel. The Global Transform option toggles between a global 
option (button depressed) and a local option (button raised). Moving an object 
with the global option on makes the transformations relative to the global coordi-
nate system, whereas moving an object with the local option on makes the transfor-
mations relative to itself.
1 Click on Scene 1 to return to the main timeline and insert a new layer at the top 
of the layer stack and rename it title.
2 Lock all the other layers.
3 Insert a new keyframe at frame 120.
4 Drag the movie clip symbol called movietitle from the Library panel onto 
the Stage.
The movie title instance appears in your new layer in the keyframe at frame 120.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 153
5 Position the title at x=180 and y=90.
6 Right-click/Ctrl-click on the movie title and choose Create Motion Tween.
Flash converts the current layer to a Tween layer so you can begin to animate 
the instance. 
7 Move the red playhead to frame 140.
8 Select the 3D Rotation tool.
9 Deselect the Global Transform option at the bottom of the Tools panel.

154 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
10 Click and drag the title to rotate it around the y-axis (green) so that its angle is 
at about –50 degrees. You can check the rotation values in the Transform panel 
(Window > Transform).
11 Move the red playhead to the first keyframe at frame 120.
12 Click and drag the title to rotate it around the y-axis in the opposite direction so 
that the instance looks like just a sliver.  
Flash motion tweens the change in the 3D rotation, so the title appears to swing 
in three dimensions. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 155
testing Your movie
You can quickly preview your animation by “scrubbing” the red playhead back and 
forth on the Timeline or by choosing Control > Play. You can also use the inte-
grated controller at the bottom of the Timeline or choose Window > Toolbars > 
Controller to display a separate controller panel.
However, to preview your animation as your audience will see it and to preview any 
nested animations within movie clip symbols, you should test your movie. Choose 
Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
Flash exports a SWF file and saves it in the same location as your FLA file. The 
SWF file is the compressed, final Flash media that you would embed in an HTML 
page to play in a browser. Flash displays the SWF file in a new window with the 
exact Stage dimensions and plays your animation.
To exit Test Movie mode, click the Close window button. 
You can also preview your animation by choosing Control > Test Movie > in Browser, 
and Flash will export a SWF file and open it automatically in your default browser.
P Note: The exported 
SWF in Test Movie mode 
will loop automatically. 
To prevent the looping 
in Test Movie mode, 
choose Control > 
Loop to deselect the 
loop option.
P Note: If you’ve 
targeted a different 
publishing platform 
in the Publish Settings 
(such as Adobe AIR), 
those options will 
be available for you 
in the Control > Test 
Movie menu. 

156 
Lesson 4 
Adding Animation
generating Png Sequences and Sprite Sheets
While you can create sophisticated animations to play as a SWF file with the Flash 
Player, you can also use Flash’s powerful tools to create your animation and export 
it as a series of images for use in other environments. For example, animations with 
HTML5 or on mobile devices rely on sequential PNG files or a single file that packs all 
the images organized in rows and columns known as a sprite sheet. The sprite sheet 
is accompanied by a data file that describes the position of each image, or sprite, 
in the file.
Generating either PNG sequences or a sprite sheet of your animation is easy. First, 
your animation must be within a Movie Clip symbol. In the Library panel, right-click/
Ctrl-click the symbol and choose Export PNG Sequence.
Select the destination on your hard drive for your images.
For a sprite sheet, right-click/Ctrl-click the symbol and choose Generate sprite sheet. 
The Generate Sprite Sheet dialog box that appears provides different options such as 
sizing, background color, and the particular data format.
Click Export to output the sprite sheet and data file.

What are three ways to add easing to a motion tween?
Review Answers
1 A motion tween requires a symbol instance on the Stage and its own layer, which is 
called a Tween layer. No other tween or drawing object can exist on the Tween layer.
2  A motion tween creates smooth transitions between different keyframes of an object’s 
location, scale, rotation, transparency, brightness, tint, filter values, or 3D rotation 
or translation.
3 A keyframe marks a change in one or more of an object’s properties. Keyframes are 
specific to each property, so that a motion tween can have keyframes for position that 
are different from keyframes for transparency. 
4 To edit the path of an object’s motion, choose the Selection tool and click and drag 
directly on the path to bend it. You can also choose the Convert Anchor Point tool 
and Subselection tool to pull out handles at the anchor points. The handles control the 
curvature of the path.
5  Three ways to add easing to a motion tween include the following: 
•
Select the motion tween on the Timeline and change the Ease value in the 
Properties inspector. 
•
In the Motion Editor, right-click/Ctrl-click on any keyframe to pull out control 
handles and change the curvature of the graph. 
•
Add a preset ease to the Ease category of the Motion Editor and apply it to a property.

ArticulAted Motion 
And Morphing
lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Animate armatures with multiple linked movie clips
• Constrain and pin the joints
• Animate armatures with shapes
• Morph organic shapes with shape tweens
• Simulate physics with the spring feature
• Use shape hints to refine shape tweens
This lesson will take approximately two and a half hours to complete. 
If needed, remove the previous lesson folder from your hard drive and 
copy the Lesson05 folder onto it.

159
You can easily create complex motion with articula-
tions—joints between linked objects—using a feature 
called inverse kinematics. You can also morph—create 
organic changes in—your shapes with shape tweens.

160 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
getting Started
You’ll start the lesson by viewing the animated crane and floating buoy that you’ll 
create as you learn about articulated motion and morphing in Flash. You’ll also be 
animating a tentacle of an octopus. 
1 Double-click the 05end.html file in the Lesson05/05End folder to play the 
animation. Double-click the 05ShapeIK_End.html to play that animation as well.
The first project is an animation depicting a crane working at the seaside dock 
and a buoy floating along the gentle undulations of the water. In this lesson, you’ll 
animate the crane arm, the buoy, and the smooth motion of the waves. The other 
project is an animation showing an octopus curling one of its tentacles.
2 Double-click the 05Start.fla file in the Lesson05/05Start folder to open the initial 
project file in Flash.
3 Choose File > Save As. Name the file 05_workingcopy.fla, and save it in the 
05Start folder. Saving a working copy ensures that the original start file will be 
available if you want to start over. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 161
Articulated Motion with inverse Kinematics
When you want to animate an articulated object (one that has multiple joints), such 
as a walking person, or as in this example, a moving crane, Flash Professional CS6 
makes it easy to do so with inverse kinematics. Inverse kinematics is a mathemati-
cal way to calculate the different angles of a jointed object to achieve a certain 
configuration. You can pose your object in a beginning keyframe, and then set a 
different pose at a later keyframe. Flash will use inverse kinematics to figure out the 
different angles for all the joints to get from the first pose to the next pose. 
Inverse kinematics makes animating easy because you don’t have to worry about 
animating each segment of an object or limb of a character. You just focus on the 
overall poses. 
defining the bones
The first step to create articulated motion is to define the bones of your object. You 
use the Bone tool (
) to do that. The Bone tool tells Flash how a series of movie 
clip instances are connected. The connected movie clips are called the armature, 
and each movie clip is called a node.
1 In your 05working_copy.fla file, select the crane layer. Lock all the other layers.
2 Drag the cranearm1 movie clip symbol from the Library panel onto the Stage. 
Place the instance right above the rectangular crane base. 

162 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
3 Drag the cranearm2 movie clip symbol from the Library panel onto the Stage. 
Place the instance next to the tip of the cranearm1 movie clip instance.
4 Drag another instance of the cranearm2 movie clip symbol from the Library 
panel onto the Stage. Place this instance next to the free tip of the first 
cranearm2 instance.
You’ll have two cranearm2 instances next to each other.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 163
5 Drag the cranerope movie clip symbol from the Library panel onto the Stage. 
Place the instance so it hangs down from the last cranearm2 instance.
Your movie clip instances are now in place and ready to be connected with bones.
6 Select the Bone tool. 
7 Click on the base of the cranearm1 instance and drag the Bone tool to the base 
of the cranearm2 instance. Release the mouse button.
Your first bone is defined. Flash shows the bone as a skinny triangle with a 
round joint at its base and a round joint at its tip. Each bone is defined from the 
base of the first node to the base of the next node. For example, to build an arm, 
you would click on the shoulder side of the upper arm and drag it to the elbow 
side of the lower arm.

164 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
8 Click on the base of the cranearm2 instance and drag it to the base of the next 
cranearm2 instance. Release the mouse button.
Your second bone is defined.
9 Click on the base of the second cranearm2 instance and drag it to the base of 
the cranerope instance. Release the mouse button.
Your third bone is defined. Note that the four movie clip instances, which are 
now connected with bones, have been separated to a new layer with a new icon 
and name. The new layer is a Pose layer, which keeps your armatures separate 
from other objects on the Timeline such as graphics or motion tweens.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 165
10 Rename the Pose layer cranearmature and delete the empty crane layer that 
contained the initial movie clip instances.
Armature hierarchy
The first bone of an armature is referred to as the 
parent, and the bone that is linked to it is called 
the child. A bone can actually have more than one 
child attached to it as well. For example, an arma-
ture of a puppet would have a pelvis connected 
to two thighs, which in turn are attached to two 
lower legs of their own. The pelvis is the parent, 
each thigh is a child, and the thighs are siblings 
to each other. As your armature becomes more 
complicated, you can use the Properties inspector 
to navigate up and down the hierarchy using these relationships. 
When you select a bone in an armature, the top of the Properties inspector displays 
a series of arrows. 
You can click the arrows to move through the hierarchy and quickly select and view 
the properties of each node. If the parent bone is selected, you can click the down 
arrow to select the child. If a child bone is selected, you can click the up arrow to 
select its parent, or click the down arrow to select its own child if it has one. The 
sideways arrows navigate between sibling nodes. 

166 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
inserting poses
Think of poses as keyframes for your armature. You have an initial pose for your 
crane in frame 1. You will insert two additional poses for the crane. The next pose 
will position the crane down as if it were picking something up from the ocean. The 
last pose will position the crane back up to lift up the object.
1 Move the red playhead to frame 50.
2 Using the Selection tool, click on the hook at the end of the cranerope instance 
and drag it down to the water.
A new pose is automatically inserted at frame 50. As you drag the cranerope 
instance, notice how the entire armature moves along with it. The bones keep 
all the different nodes connected.
3 Move the red playhead to frame 100 (the last frame).

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 167
4 Click on the hook at the end of the cranerope instance and drag it up out of 
the water.
A new pose is automatically inserted at frame 100.
5 Preview the animation by choosing Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
The crane animates, moving all its crane segments from one pose to the next.
isolating the rotation of individual nodes
As you pull and push on the armature to 
create your pose, you may find it difficult 
to control the rotation of individual nodes 
because of their linkages. Holding down the 
Shift key as you move individual nodes will 
isolate their rotation.
1 Select the third pose at frame 100.
2 Holding down the Shift key, click and drag 
on the second node in the armature to 
rotate it so that it points downward.
The second node of the crane rotates, but 
the first node does not.
P Note: You can edit 
poses on the Timeline 
just as you can with 
keyframes of a motion 
tween. Right-click/Ctrl-
click along the Timeline 
and choose Insert Pose 
to insert a new pose. 
Right-click/Ctrl-click 
on any pose and select 
Clear Pose to remove 
the pose from the layer. 
Ctrl-click/Command-
click on a pose to select 
it. Click and drag the 
pose to move it to a 
different position along 
the Timeline.

168 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
3 Holding down the Shift key, click and drag on the third node in the armature to 
rotate it so that it points upward.
The third node of the crane rotates, but the first and second nodes do not.
4 Holding down the Shift key, click and drag on the last node in the armature (the 
cranerope instance) so that it points straight down.
Holding down the Shift key helps you isolate the rotations of the individual 
nodes so that you can position your poses exactly as you want them. The crane 
now retracts by collapsing its different arm segments.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 169
pinning individual nodes
Another way you can more precisely control the 
rotation or position of your armature is to fix indi-
vidual nodes in place, leaving the child nodes free 
to move in a different pose. You do this by using 
the Pin option in the Properties inspector. 
1
Choose the Selection tool. 
2
Select the second node of the crane armature.
3
In the Properties inspector, check the Pin option.
The tail, or end of the selected node, is 
fixed to the Stage in the current position. 
An “X” appears on the joint to indicate that 
it is pinned.
4 Drag the last node in the armature.
Only the last two nodes move. Note how the 
armature motion is different when using the Pin 
option versus using the Shift key. The Shift key 
isolates an individual node and all the rest of the 
nodes connected to it. When you pin a node, the 
pinned node remains fixed, but you’re free to move 
all the child nodes.
P Note: You can also 
select a node and click 
on its tail when the icon 
of a pushpin appears 
as your cursor. That 
selected node will be 
pinned. Click again to 
unpin the node.

170 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
editing Armatures
You can easily edit the armature by repositioning the nodes or by deleting and add-
ing new bones. If one of the nodes of your armature is slightly off, for example, you 
can use the Free Transform tool to rotate it or move it into a new position. This does 
not change the bones, however.
You can also move nodes into new positions by holding down the Alt/Option key 
while dragging the node to a different location.
If you want to remove bones, simply click on the bone that you want to delete and 
press the Delete key on the keyboard. The selected bone and all the bones con-
nected to it down the chain will be removed. You can then add new bones if desired. 
constraining Joints
The various joints of the crane can freely rotate, which isn’t particularly realistic. 
Many armatures in real life are constrained to certain angles of rotation. For exam-
ple, your forearm can rotate up toward your bicep, but it can’t rotate in the other 
direction beyond your bicep. When working with armatures in Flash Professional 
CS6, you can choose to constrain the rotation for various joints or even constrain 
the translation (movement) of the various joints.
Next, you’ll constrain the rotation and translation of the various joints of the crane 
so they move more realistically.
constraining the rotation of joints
By default, the rotation of joints have no constraints, which means they can rotate 
in a full circle, or 360 degrees. If you want a certain joint to rotate only in a quarter 
circle arc, constrain the joint to 90 degrees.
1 Make sure that none of the nodes in your armature are pinned.
2 Click the second pose at frame 50 in the cranearmature layer, right-click/ 
Ctrl-click, and select Clear Pose.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 171
3 Click the third pose at frame 100 in the cranearmature layer, right-click/  
Ctrl-click, and select Clear Pose. 
Your armature now has only a single pose at frame 1.
4 Move the red playhead to frame 1. 
5 Choose the Selection tool. 
6 Click on the second bone in the crane armature.
The bone becomes highlighted, indicating that it is selected.

172 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
7 In the Properties inspector, select the Constrain option in the Joint: 
Rotation section.
An angle indicator appears on the joint, showing the minimum and maximum 
allowable angles and the current position of the node.
8 Set the minimum joint rotation angle to 0 degrees and the maximum joint 
rotation angle to 90 degrees.
The angle indicator changes on the joint, showing the allowable angles. In this 
example, the second segment of the crane can only bend downward or rise up 
to be level with the horizon.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 173
9 Click on the third bone in the crane armature.
The bone becomes highlighted, indicating that it is selected.
10 In the Properties inspector, select the Constrain option in the Joint: 
Rotation section.
An angle indicator appears on the joint, showing the minimum and maximum 
allowable angles and the current position of the node.
11 Set the minimum joint rotation angle to -90 degrees and the maximum joint 
rotation angle to 0 degrees.
The angle indicator changes on the joint, showing the allowable angles. In this 
example, the third segment of the crane can bend only from a level position to a 
vertical position. Each joint in an armature can have its own rotation constraints.

174 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
constraining the translation of joints
You don’t normally think of joints that can move positions. However, in Flash 
Professional CS6, you can allow joints to actually slide in either the x (horizontal) 
or the y (vertical) direction, and set the limits on how far those joints can travel.
In this example, you’ll allow the first node (the tall first segment of the crane) to 
move back and forth as if it were on a track. This will give it the capability to pick 
up any sort of cargo from the ocean and place it on the dock.
1 Click on the first node in the crane armature.
2 Deselect the Enable option in the Joint: Rotation section of the Properties 
inspector. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 175
The circle around the joint disappears, indicating that it can no longer rotate.
3 Select the Enable option in the Joint: X Translation section of the Properties 
inspector.
Arrows appear from the joint, indicating that the joint can travel in that direction.

176 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
4 Select the Constrain option in the Joint: X Translation section of the Properties 
inspector. 
The arrows turn into straight lines, indicating that the translation is limited.
5 Set the minimum X translation to -50 and the maximum X translation to 50.
The bars indicate how much translation in the x direction the first bone can do.
6 Grab the hook and pose the crane in the first keyframe so that the first node is 
close to the edge of the water and the hook is lowered.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 177
7 Move the red playhead on the Timeline to the last frame. 
8 Move the hook out of the water and the crane back from the edge of the water, 
creating a new pose. 
The constraints on joint rotation and joint translation impose limits on the 
poses that help you create more realistic animations.
9 Watch your animation by choosing Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
changing Joint Speed
Joint speed refers to the stickiness, or stiffness,  
of a joint. A joint with a low joint speed value 
will be sluggish. A joint with a high joint speed 
value will be more responsive. You can set the 
joint speed value for any selected joint in the 
Properties inspector. 
The joint speed is apparent when you drag the 
very end of an armature. If there are slow joints 
higher up on the armature chain, those particular 
joints will be less responsive and will rotate to a lesser degree than the others.
To change the joint speed, click on a bone to select it. In the Properties inspector, set 
the joint Speed value from 0% to 100%.

178 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
inverse Kinematics with Shapes
The crane is an armature made with various movie clip symbols. You can also cre-
ate armatures with shapes, which are useful for animating objects without obvious 
joints and segments but can still have an articulated motion. For example, the arms 
of an octopus have no actual joints, but you can add bones to a smooth tentacle to 
animate its undulating motion. 
defining bones inside a shape
You’ll add bones to an octopus—perhaps one that was picked up by the crane from 
the ocean depths—and animate one of its tentacles.
1 Open the file 05ShapeIK_Start.fla. Choose File > Save As. Name the file 
05ShapeIK_workingcopy.fla.
The file contains an illustration of an octopus. One arm is separated on its own 
layer called arm1.
2 Lock all the layers except for the arm1 layer and select the contents of the 
arm1 layer. 
3 Choose the Bone tool.

4 Click on the base of the tentacle in the arm1 layer and drag out the first bone a 
little ways down toward the tip of the tentacle. 
The first bone is defined. The contents of the arm1 layer are separated to a new 
Pose layer.
5 Click on the end of the first bone and drag out the next bone a little farther 
down toward the tip of the tentacle.
The second bone is defined.

editing the shape
You don’t need any special tools to edit the shape that contains bones. Many of the 
same drawing and editing tools in the Tools panel, such as the Paint Bucket, the Ink 
Bottle, and the Subselection tools, are available to you to edit the fill, the stroke, or 
the contours.
1
Choose the Paint Bucket tool.
2
Choose a dark peach color for the Fill.
3
Click on the shape in the Pose layer.
The fill color of the tentacle changes.
4
Choose the Ink Bottle tool.
5
Choose a dark red color for the stroke.
6
Click on the shape in the Pose layer.
The outline of the tentacle changes color.

182 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
7 Choose the Subselection tool.
8 Click on the contour of the shape.
The anchor points and the control handles appear around the contour of the shape.
9 Drag the anchor points to new locations or click and drag the handles to make 
edits to the tentacle shape.
P Note: Add new 
points on the contour 
of the shape with the 
Add Anchor Point tool. 
Delete points on the 
contour of the shape 
with the Delete Anchor 
Point tool. Both the 
Add Anchor Point and 
Delete Anchor Point 
tools are located under 
the Pen tool.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 183
editing the bones and armature
The Subselection tool can move the joints within a shape. However, the location of 
the joints within the shape can be edited only when you have a single pose for your 
armature. After your armature has been repositioned in later frames of the Pose 
layer, changes to the bone structure cannot be made.
Use the Selection tool if you want to move the entire armature to a different loca-
tion but keep the bone structure unchanged.
1
Choose the Subselection tool.
2
Click on a joint.
3
Click and drag the joint within the shape to a new location. 
4 Choose the Selection tool. Hold down the Alt/Option key and drag the entire 
armature (and the shape around it) to a new location. 
P Note: You can easily remove bones or add more bones to your armature. Choose the Selection 
tool and click on the bone you want to delete. Press the Delete key to remove the selected bone; 
all the child bones will be removed as well. Add new bones by choosing the Bone tool and clicking 
on the armature.

184 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
refining Shape Behavior with the Bind tool
The organic control of a shape by 
its armature is a result of a map-
ping between the anchor points 
along the shape and its bones. The 
points along the tip of the tentacle, 
for example, are mapped to the 
very last bone, whereas the points 
farther up the tentacle are mapped 
to the bones farther up the tentacle. 
Hence, where the bones rotate, the 
shape follows.
You can edit the connections 
between the bones and their control 
points with the Bind tool (
). The 
Bind tool is hidden under the Bone 
tool. The Bind tool displays which control points are connected to which bones and lets you break 
those connections and make new ones.
Choose the Bind tool and click on any bone in the shape. The selected bone is highlighted in red, and 
all the connected control points on the shape are highlighted in yellow.
If you want to redefine which control points are connected to the selected bone, you can do the following:
•
Shift-click to add additional associations to control points.
•
Ctrl-click/Command-click to remove associations to control points.
•
Drag a connection line between the bone and the control point. In the following figure, a line is 
being dragged from the selected bone to a point on the left to make the association.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 185
Click on any control point on the shape. The selected control point is highlighted in red, and all the 
connected bones are highlighted in yellow. In the following figure, the red highlighted point is associ-
ated with the first bone.
If you want to redefine which bones are connected to the selected control point, you can do the following:
•
Shift-click to add additional associations to bones.
•
Ctrl-click/Command-click to remove associations to bones.
•
Drag a connection line between the control point and the bone. In the following figure, another 
control point farther down the tentacle is being associated with the first bone.

Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
Armature options
Many settings are available through the Properties inspector that can help you make 
your armature interactive or help you apply easing to your armature motion. You can 
also choose different viewing options for your armature to suit your working style. 
Authortime and runtime armatures
Authortime armatures are those that you pose along the Timeline and play as 
straightforward animations. Runtime armatures refer to armatures that are interac-
tive and allow the user to move your armature. You can make any of your arma-
tures—whether they are made with a series of movie clips such as the crane or 
made with a shape such as the octopus tentacle—into an authortime or a runtime 
armature. Runtime armatures, however, are restricted to armatures that have only 
a single pose.
1
Continue with the file 05ShapeIK_workingcopy.fla.
2
Select the layer containing the tentacle armature.
3
In the Properties inspector, select Runtime from the Type option.
The armature becomes a runtime armature, allowing the user to directly 
manipulate the octopus tentacle. The first frame of the Pose layer displays the 
armature icon to indicate that the runtime option is selected and no additional 
poses can be added.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 187
4 Test your movie by choosing Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
The user can click and drag the tentacle and interactively move it on the Stage.
controlling easing
The Motion Editor and its sophisticated controls for easing cannot be used with 
armatures. However, there are a few standard eases available from the Properties 
inspector that you can apply to your armatures. Easing can make your armature 
move with a sense of gravity due to acceleration or deceleration of its motion.
1 Select the layer containing the tentacle armature.
2 In the Properties inspector, select Authortime for Type in the Options section.
The armature becomes an authortime armature again.
3 Select frame 40 for all the layers and choose Insert > Timeline > Frame.
Frames are inserted in all the layers, giving you room on the Timeline to create 
additional poses for the tentacle.
4 Move the red playhead to frame 40.

188 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
5 With the Selection tool, grab the tip of the tentacle, curl it upward, and move it 
to one side.
A new pose is inserted in frame 40 for the tentacle armature.
6 Select the first pose in frame 1 of the Armature layer.
7 In the Properties inspector, select Simple (Medium) for the Type under the Ease 
section.
The variations of Simple eases (from Slow to Fastest) represent the severity of 
the ease. They represent the same curvatures provided in the Motion Editor for 
motion tweens.
8 Set the Strength to 100.
The Strength represents the direction of the ease. A negative value is an ease-in 
and a positive value is an ease-out.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 189
9 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to preview your animation.
The tentacle curls up, easing out of its motion gradually. 
10 Close the Test Movie window.
11 Select the first pose in frame 1.
12 Change the Strength setting to -100 and test your movie again.
The tentacle curls up, but the motion now eases in, starting slowly and gradually 
speeding up.
13 Close the Test Movie window.
14 Select the first pose in frame 1.
15 In the Properties inspector under the Ease 
section, select Start and Stop (Medium) for Type.
The variations of Stop and Start eases (from Slow 
to Fastest) represent the severity of the ease. The 
Stop and Start eases have curves on both ends of 
the motion, so the easing values affect the start of 
the motion and the end of the motion.
16 Set the Strength to -100.
17 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to preview your animation.
The tentacle curls up, easing into its motion gradually and also easing out of its 
motion gradually.

Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
Morphing with Shape tweens
Shape tweening is a technique for interpolating amorphous changes between 
shapes in different keyframes. Shape tweens make it possible to smoothly morph 
one thing into another. Any kind of animation that requires that the contours of a 
shape change—for example, animation of clouds, water, or fire—is a perfect candi-
date for shape tweening.
Both the fill and the stroke of a shape can be smoothly animated. Because shape tween-
ing only applies to shapes, you can’t use groups, symbol instances, or bitmap images.
establish keyframes containing different shapes
In the following steps, you’ll animate the gently undulating surface of the ocean 
beneath the crane with a shape tween.
1 Continue with the file of the crane animation called 05_workingcopy.fla.
2 Lock and hide all the layers except for the water layer. The water layer contains a 
transparent blue shape at the bottom of the Stage.
3 Move the red playhead to frame 50 in the water layer.
4 Right-click/Ctrl-click on frame 50 in the water layer and select Insert Keyframe. 
Or, choose Insert > Timeline > Keyframe (F6).
A new keyframe is inserted at frame 50. The contents of the previous keyframe 
are copied into the second keyframe.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 191
5 Move the red playhead to frame 100.
6 Right-click/Ctrl-click on frame 100 in the water layer and select Insert 
Keyframe. Or, choose Insert > Timeline > Keyframe (F6).
A new keyframe is inserted at frame 100. The contents of the previous keyframe 
are copied into this keyframe. You now have three keyframes on the Timeline in 
the water layer: one at frame 1, a second at frame 50, and a third at frame 100.
7 Move the red playhead back to frame 50.
Next, you’ll change the shape of the water in the second keyframe.
8 Choose the Selection tool.
9 Deselect the water shape. Click and drag the contours of the water shape so that 
the crests become dips and the dips become crests.
Each subsequent keyframe in the water layer contains a different shape. 
Apply the shape tween 
The next step is to apply a shape tween between the keyframes to create the 
smooth transitions.
1 Click on any frame between the first keyframe and the second keyframe in the 
water layer.
2 Right-click/Ctrl-click and select Create Shape Tween. Or, from the top menu 
choose Insert > Shape Tween.

192 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
Flash applies a shape tween between the two keyframes, which is indicated by a 
black forward-pointing arrow.
3 Click on any frame between the second keyframe and the last keyframe in the 
water layer.
4 Right-click/Ctrl-click and select Create Shape Tween. Or, choose Insert > 
Shape Tween.
Flash applies a shape tween between the last two keyframes, which is indicated 
by a black forward-pointing arrow.
5 Watch your animation by choosing Control > Test Movie > in Flash 
Professional. Flash creates a smooth animation between the keyframes in the 
water layer, morphing the shape of the ocean surface.
P Note: The Motion 
Editor is not available 
for shape tweens.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 193
using Shape hints
Shape hints force Flash to map points on the first shape to corresponding points on 
the second shape. By placing multiple shape hints, you can control more precisely 
how a shape tween animates from one shape to the next. 
Adding shape hints
Now you’ll add shape hints to the shape tween of the wave to modify the way it 
morphs from one shape to the next.
1 Select the first keyframe of the shape tween in the water layer.

194 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
2 Choose Modify > Shape > Add Shape Hint (Ctrl+Shift+H/Command+Shift+H).
A red circled letter “a” appears on the Stage. The circled letter represents the 
first shape hint.
3 Drag the circled letter to the top-left corner of the ocean shape.
Shape hints should be placed on the contours of shapes.
4 Choose Modify > Shape > Add Shape Hint again to create a second shape hint.
A red circled “b” appears on the Stage.
5 Drag the “b” shape hint to the top edge of the ocean shape at the bottom of a dip 
of the wave.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 195
6 Add a third shape hint.
A red circled “c” appears on the Stage.
7 Drag the “c” shape hint to the far top-right corner of the ocean shape.
You have three shape hints mapped to different points on the shape in the 
first keyframe.
8 Select the next keyframe of the water layer (frame 50).
A corresponding circled “c” appears on the Stage, although an “a” and a “b” 
shape hint are directly under it.
9 Drag the circled letters to corresponding points on the shape in the second 
keyframe. The “a” hint goes on the top-left corner, the “b” hint goes on the 
bottom of the wave, and the “c” hint goes on the top-right corner.
The shape hints are green, indicating that you’ve correctly placed the shape hint.

196 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
10 Select the first keyframe.
Note that the initial shape hints are yellow, indicating that they are 
correctly placed.
11 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to see the effects of the 
shape hints on the shape tween.
The shape hints force the dip of the first shape to map to the dip of the second 
shape, causing the shape tween to appear more like a traveling wave instead of 
an up-and-down bobbing motion. Use shape hints to lock down certain parts of 
the shape (such as the “a” and “c” hints in this example), or to tell Flash where to 
move the shape (such as the “b” hint).
removing shape hints
If you’ve added too many shape hints, you can easily delete the unnecessary ones. 
Removing a shape hint in one keyframe will remove its corresponding shape hint in 
the other keyframe.
• Drag an individual shape hint entirely off the Stage and Pasteboard.
• Choose Modify > Shape > Remove All Hints to delete all the shape hints.
Simulating physics with inverse Kinematics
Now that you’ve animated the undulating water beneath the crane, it would be nice 
to see the red buoy bob up and down along the surface as well. You could create 
a motion tween so it floats along the water. However, since the buoy has a flexible 
flag attached, it’ll be more realistic to see the flag and the pole wave and bend as the 
buoy moves. The Spring feature helps you do this easily.
The Spring feature simulates physics in any animated armature. A flexible object 
(like a flag or a flag pole) normally would have some “springiness” that would cause 
it to jiggle on its own as it moves, and continue to jiggle even after motion of the 
entire body stops. The amount of springiness can be set for each bone in an arma-
ture to help you get the exact amount of rigidity or flexibility in your animation.
P Note: You can add a 
maximum of 26 shape 
hints to any shape 
tween. Be sure to add 
them in a clockwise 
or counterclockwise 
direction for best 
results.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 197
define bones for your armature
In the following steps, you’ll animate the buoy bobbing along the water and set the 
strength of the spring in each of the bones in the armature of the buoy. The first 
step is to add bones to the shape of the buoy.
1 Lock and hide all the layers except for the buoy layer and select the contents of 
the buoy layer. 
2 Choose the Bone tool.
3 Click on the base of the buoy and drag out the first bone to the tip of the 
triangular support at the bottom of the flag pole.
The first bone is defined. The contents of the buoy layer are separated to a new 
Pose layer.
4 Click on the end of the first bone and drag out the next bone a little farther up 
the flag pole.
The second bone is defined.

198 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
5 Click on the end of the second bone and drag out the next bone to the left into 
the flag. 
6 Define two more bones to extend the armature to the tip of the flag.
The bones in the flag will help the flag wave realistically. The bone in the flag 
pole will help the pole bend separately from the floating bottom. 
Setting the spring strength for each bone
Next, you’ll set the strength value for the spring for each bone. The strength value 
can range from 0 (no spring) to 100 (maximum spring). 
1 Select the last bone (at the tip of the flag) of the armature in the buoy.
P Note: The Spring 
feature for inverse 
kinematics works for 
both armatures in 
shapes and armatures 
with movie clips.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 199
2 In the Properties inspector, in the Spring section, enter 100 for the Strength.
The last bone has the maximum spring strength since the flag tip is the most 
flexible part of the whole buoy and would have the most independent motion. 
3 Select the next bone in the armature hierarchy. It 
may be difficult to select the next adjacent bone if 
they are too crowded together, so you can choose 
the Parent button in the Properties inspector to 
move up the hierarchy.
4 In the Properties inspector, in the Spring section, 
enter 60 for the Strength.
The middle of the flag is a little less flexible than 
the tip, so it has a smaller strength value.
5 Select the next adjacent bone, and in the Properties inspector, in the Spring 
section, enter 40 for the Strength.
The base of the flag is even less flexible than the middle of the flag, so it has an 
even smaller strength value.
6 Select the next adjacent bone (the bone within the pole), and in the Properties 
inspector, in the Spring section, enter 50 for the Strength.

200 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
Giving the pole a medium amount of spring strength will make the pole bend 
back and forth on the buoy.
7 Select the next adjacent bone (the parent bone), and in the Properties inspector, 
in the Spring section, enter 20 for the Strength.
insert the next pose
Next, you’ll make the buoy float atop the water and watch how its motion affects 
the movement of the individual bones in the armature.
1 Unhide all the layers so you can see where the buoy is located on the scene.
2 Select frame 35 of the armature layer, which contains your buoy.
3 Rotate the first bone of the buoy to the left to make it rock slightly on the 
surface of the water.
4 Rotate the second bone (the flag pole) just a bit to the right to bend it.
5 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to see the motion of the 
buoy and its attached flag.
The buoy sways to the left. At the same time, the flag pole bends and the flag 
jiggles slightly. Even after the keyframe at frame 35, the buoy continues to rock 
back and forth slightly.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssrooM in A book 201
6 Move the playhead to frame 75.
7 Rotate the first bone of the buoy back to the right to make it sway in the other 
direction.
8 Test your movie again to see the complete motion.
The back-and-forth rotation of the buoy affects the lingering springing motion 
throughout the armature and makes the animation more realistic and much 
simpler to animate.
P Note: The effects of 
the Spring feature are 
more apparent when 
there are additional 
frames on the Timeline 
after the armature’s final 
pose, as in this lesson. 
The additional frames 
allow you to see the 
residual bouncing effect 
after the motion stops. 

202 
Lesson 5 
Articulated Motion and Morphing
Adding damping effects
Damping refers to how much the spring effect decreases with time. It wouldn’t 
be realistic if the rocking of the buoy or the swaying of the flag and the flag pole 
continues indefinitely. Over time, the swaying should lessen and eventually stop. 
You can set a damping value from 0 (no damping) to 100 (maximum damping) to 
control how rapidly these effects diminish.
1 Select the first bone of the buoy (in the floating part), and in the Properties 
inspector, in the Spring section, enter 100 for the Damping.
The maximum damping value will decrease the rocking of the buoy over time.
2 Continue to select each of the bones of the armature and enter the maximum 
value (100) for Damping. 
3 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to see the effects that the 
damping values have on the motion of your floating buoy. 
The buoy and the flag and flag pole still sway, but their motion quickly subsides 
after the initial starting motion and after the last keyframe. The damping values 
help add a sense of weight to the armature. Experiment with both the strength 
and damping values in the Spring section of your armature to get the most 
realistic motion.

review Answers
1 The Bone tool can connect movie clip instances together to form an articulated object 
that can be posed and animated with inverse kinematics. The Bone tool can also 
create an armature wtihin a shape, which can be posed and animated with inverse 
kinematics as well. 
2  The Bind tool can redefine the connections between the control points of a shape and 
the bones of an armature. The connections between the control points and the bones 
determine how the shape reacts to the bending and rotations of the armature.
3 Bones are the objects that connect individual movie clips together or that make up 
the internal structure of a shape for motion with inverse kinematics. A node is one 
of the movie clip instances that have been linked with the Bone tool. A node can be 
described in terms of its relationship with other nodes, such as parent, child, or sibling. 
Joints are the articulations between bones. Joints can rotate as well as translate (slide 
in both the x and y directions). Armatures refer to the complete articulated object. 
Armatures are separated on a special Pose layer on the Timeline where poses can be 
inserted for animation.
4 A shape tween creates smooth transitions between keyframes containing different 
shapes. To apply a shape tween, create different shapes in an initial keyframe and in a 
final keyframe. Then select any frame between the keyframes in the Timeline, right-
click/Ctrl-click, and select Create Shape Tween. 
5 Shape hints are labeled markers that indicate how one point on the initial shape of 
a shape tween will map to a corresponding point on the final shape. Shape hints 
help refine the way the shapes will morph. To use shape hints, first select the initial 
keyframe of a shape tween. Choose Modify > Shape > Add Shape Hint. Move the first 
shape hint to the edge of the shape. Move the playhead to the final keyframe, and move 
the corresponding shape hint to a matching edge of the shape.
6 Strength is the amount of springiness of any individual bone in an armature. Add 
springiness with the Spring feature to simulate the way different parts of a flexible 
object jiggle when the entire object moves and continue to jiggle when the object 
stops. Damping refers to how quickly the springiness effect subsides over time.

Let your viewers explore your project and become 
active participants. Button symbols and ActionScript 
work together to create engaging, user-driven,  
interactive experiences.

206 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
getting Started
To begin, view the interactive restaurant guide that you’ll create as you learn to 
make interactive projects in Flash. 
1 Double-click the 06End.html file in the Lesson06/06End folder to play 
the animation.
The project is an interactive restaurant guide for an imaginary city. Viewers 
can click any button to see more information about a particular restaurant. 
In this lesson, you’ll create interactive buttons and structure the Timeline 
properly. You’ll learn to write ActionScript to provide instructions for what 
each button will do.
2 Close the 06End.html file. 
3 Double-click the 06Start.fla file in the Lesson06/06Start folder to open the initial 
project file in Flash. The file includes several assets already in the Library panel, 
and the Stage has already been sized properly.
4 Choose File > Save As. Name the file 06_workingcopy.fla and save it in the 
06Start folder. Saving a working copy ensures that the original start file will be 
available if you want to start over. 
about interactive Movies
Interactive movies change based on the viewer’s actions. For example, when the 
viewer clicks a button, a different graphic with more information is displayed. 
Interactivity can be simple, such as a button click, or it can be complex, receiving 
inputs from a variety of sources, such as the movements of the mouse, keystrokes 
from the keyboard, or even data from databases. 
In Flash, you use ActionScript to achieve most interactivity. ActionScript provides 
the instructions that tell each button what to do when the user clicks one of them. 
In this lesson, you’ll learn to create a nonlinear navigation—one in which the movie 
doesn’t have to play straight from the beginning to the end. ActionScript can tell 
the Flash playhead to jump around and go to different frames of the Timeline based 
on which button the user clicks. Different frames on the Timeline contain different 
content. The user doesn’t actually know that the playhead is jumping around the 
Timeline; the user just sees (or hears) different content appear as the buttons are 
clicked on the Stage.
P Note: Flash warns 
you if your computer 
doesn’t have the same 
fonts contained in a FLA 
file. Choose substitute 
fonts, or simply click Use 
Default to have Flash 
automatically make the 
substitutions.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 207
Creating Buttons
A button is a basic visual indicator of what the user can interact with. The user usu-
ally clicks a button, but many other types of interactions are possible. For example, 
something can happen when the user rolls the mouse over a button. 
Buttons are a kind of symbol that have four special states, or keyframes, that  
determine how the button appears. Buttons can look like virtually anything— 
an image, graphic, or a bit of text—they don’t have to be those typical pill-shaped, 
gray rectangles that you see on many Web sites. 
Creating a button symbol
In this lesson, you’ll create buttons with small thumbnail images and restaurant 
names. A button symbol’s four special states include the following: 
• Up state. Shows the button as it appears when the mouse is not interacting 
with it.
•
Over state. Shows the button as it appears when the mouse is hovering over it. 
•
Down state. Shows the button as it appears when the mouse button is depressed. 
•
Hit state. Indicates the clickable area of the button. 
You’ll understand the relationship between these states and the button appearance 
as you work through this exercise.
1 Choose Insert > New Symbol. 
2 In the Create New Symbol dialog box, select Button and name the symbol gabel 
loffel button. Click OK.
Flash brings you to symbol-editing mode for your new button.

208 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
3 In the Library panel, expand the folder called restaurant thumbnails and drag 
the graphic symbol gabel loffel thumbnail to the middle of the Stage.
4 In the Properties inspector, set the X value to 0 and the Y value to 0.
The upper-left corner of the small gabel loffel restaurant image is now aligned to 
the registration point of the symbol.
5 Select the Hit frame in the Timeline and choose Insert > Timeline > Frame to 
extend the Timeline.
The gabel loffel image now extends through the Up, Over, Down, and Hit states.
6 Insert a new layer.
7 Select the Over frame and choose Insert > Timeline > Keyframe.
A new keyframe is inserted in the Over state of the top layer.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 209
8 In the Library panel, expand the folder called restaurant previews, and drag the 
movie clip symbol called gabel loffel over info to the Stage.
9 In the Properties inspector, set the X value to 0 and the Y value to 215.
The gray information box will appear over the restaurant image whenever the 
mouse cursor rolls over the button.
10 Insert a third layer above the first two. 
11 Select the Down frame on the new layer and choose Insert > Timeline > Keyframe.
A new keyframe is inserted in the Down state of the new layer.
12 Drag the sound file called clicksound.mp3 from 
the Library panel to the Stage.

210 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
13 Select the Down keyframe where the sound form appears, and in the Properties 
inspector, make sure that Sync is set to Event.
A clicking sound will play only when a viewer depresses the button.
14 Click Scene 1 above the Stage to exit symbol-editing mode and return to the 
main Timeline. Your first button symbol is complete! Look in your Library panel 
to see the new button symbol stored there.
P Note: You’ll learn 
more about sound in 
Lesson 8, “Working with 
Sound and Video.”

invisible Buttons and the  
Hit Keyframe
Your button symbol’s Hit keyframe indicates the area that is “hot,” or clickable, to the 
user. Normally, the Hit keyframe contains a shape that is the same size and location 
as the shape in your Up keyframe. In most cases, you want the graphics that users 
see to be the same area where they click. However, in certain advanced applications, 
you may want the Hit keyframe and the Up keyframe to be different. If your Up 
keyframe is empty, the resulting button is known as an invisible button.
Users can’t see invisible buttons, but because the Hit keyframe still defines a click-
able area, invisible buttons remain active. So, you can place invisible buttons over 
any part of the Stage and use ActionScript to program them to respond to users. 
Invisible buttons are useful for creating generic hotspots. For example, placing them 
on top of different photos can help you make each photo respond to a mouse click 
without having to make each photo a different button symbol.
Duplicating buttons
Now that you’ve created one button, you’ll be able to create others more easily. 
You’ll duplicate one button here, change the image in the next section, and then 
continue to duplicate buttons and modify images for the remaining restaurants. 
1 In the Library panel, right-click/Ctrl-click the gabel loffel button symbol and 
select Duplicate. You can also click the options menu at the top-right corner 
of the Library panel and select Duplicate.

212 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
2 In the Duplicate Symbol dialog box, select Button, and name it gary gari 
button. Click OK.
Swapping bitmaps
Bitmaps and symbols are easy to swap on the Stage and can significantly speed up 
your workflow.
1 In the Library panel, double-click the icon for your newly duplicated symbol 
(gary gari button) to edit it. 
2 Select the restaurant image on the Stage.
3 In the Properties inspector, click Swap.
4 In the Swap Symbol dialog box, select the next thumbnail image, called gary gari 
thumbnail, and click OK.
The original thumbnail (shown with a black dot next to the symbol name) 
is swapped for the one you selected. Because they are both the same size, 
the replacement is seamless.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 213
5 Now select the Over keyframe and click the gray information box on the Stage. 
6 In the Properties inspector, click Swap and swap the selected symbol with the 
symbol called gary gari over info.
The instance in the Over keyframe of your button is replaced with one that 
is appropriate for the second restaurant. Since the symbol was duplicated, all 
other elements, such as the sound in the top layer, remain the same.
7 Continue duplicating your buttons and swapping 
the two instances inside them until you have 
four different button symbols in your Library 
panel, each representing a different restaurant. 
When you’re done, it’s a good idea to organize 
all your restaurant buttons in a folder in your 
Library panel.

214 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
Placing the button instances
The buttons need to be put on the Stage and given names in the Properties inspec-
tor so that ActionScript can identify them. 
1 On the main Timeline, insert a new layer and rename it buttons.
2 Drag each of your buttons from the Library panel to the middle of the Stage, 
placing them in a horizontal row. Don’t worry about their exact position 
because you’ll align them nicely in the next few steps.
3 Select the first button, and in the Properties inspector, set the X value to 100.
4 Select the last button, and in the Properties inspector, set the X value to 680.
5 Select all four buttons. In the Align panel (Window > Align), deselect the Align 
to stage option, click the Space Evenly Horizontally button, and then click the 
Align Top Edge button. 
All four buttons are now evenly distributed and aligned horizontally.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 215
6 With all the buttons still selected, in the Properties inspector, enter 170 for the 
Y value. 
All four buttons are positioned on the Stage correctly.
7 You can now test your movie to see how the buttons behave. Choose Control > 
Test Movie > in Flash Professional. Note how the gray information box in the 
Over keyframe appears when your mouse hovers over each button, and how 
the clicking sound is triggered when you depress your mouse over each button. 
At this point, however, you haven’t provided any instructions for the buttons to 
actually do anything. That part comes after you name the buttons and learn a 
little about ActionScript.

216 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
naming the button instances
Name each button instance so that it can be referenced by ActionScript. This is a 
crucial step that many beginners forget to do.
1 Click on an empty part of the Stage to deselect all the buttons, and then select 
just the first button.
2 Type gabelloffel_btn in the Instance Name field in the Properties inspector.
3 Name each of the other buttons garygari_btn, ilpiatto_btn, and 
pierreplatters_btn.
Make sure that you use all lowercase letters, leave no spaces, and double-check 
the spelling of each button instance. Flash is very picky and one typo will 
prevent your entire project from working correctly!
4 Lock all the layers. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 217
naming rules
Naming instances is a critical step in creating interactive Flash projects. The 
most common mistake made by novices is not to name, or to incorrectly name, 
a button instance.
The instance names are important because ActionScript uses the names to refer-
ence those objects. Instance names are not the same as the symbol names in the 
Library panel. The names in the Library panel are simply organizational reminders. 
Instance naming follows these simple rules:
1
Do not use spaces or special punctuation. Underscores are okay to use.
2
Do not begin a name with a number.
3
Be aware of uppercase and lowercase letters. Instance names are case-sensitive.
4
End your button name with _btn. Although it is not required, it helps identify 
those objects as buttons.
5
Do not use any word that is reserved for a Flash ActionScript command.
Understanding actionScript 3.0
Adobe Flash Professional CS6 uses ActionScript 3.0, a robust scripting language, to 
extend the functionality of Flash. Although ActionScript 3.0 may seem intimidating 
to you if you’re new to scripting, you can get great results with some very simple 
scripts. As with any language, it’s best if you take the time to learn the syntax and 
some basic terminology.
about actionScript
ActionScript, which is similar to JavaScript, lets you add more interactivity to Flash 
animations. In this lesson, you’ll use ActionScript to attach behaviors to buttons. You’ll 
also learn how to use ActionScript for such simple tasks as stopping an animation. 
You don’t have to be a scripting expert to use ActionScript. In fact, for common 
tasks, you may be able to copy script that other Flash users have shared. And you 
can also use the Code Snippets panel, which provides an easy, visual way to add 
ActionScript to your project or share ActionScript code among developers. 
However, you’ll be able to accomplish much more in Flash—and feel more confi-
dent using the application—if you understand how ActionScript works.
This lesson isn’t designed to make you an ActionScript expert. Instead, it intro-
duces common terms and syntax, walks you through a simple script, and provides 
an introduction to the ActionScript language. 

218 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
If you’ve used scripting languages before, the documentation included in the Flash 
Help menu may provide additional guidance you need to use ActionScript profi-
ciently. If you’re new to scripting and want to learn ActionScript, you may find an 
ActionScript 3.0 book for beginners helpful. 
Understanding scripting terminology
Many of the terms used in describing ActionScript are similar to terms used for 
other scripting languages. The following terms are used frequently in ActionScript 
documentation.
variable
A variable represents a specific piece of data that may or may not be constant. 
When you create, or declare, a variable, you also assign a data type, which deter-
mines what kind of data the variable can represent. For example, a String variable 
holds any string of alphanumeric characters, whereas a Number variable must 
contain a number.
Keyword
In ActionScript, a keyword is a reserved word that is used to perform a specific 
task. For example, var is a keyword that is used to create a variable.
You can find a complete list of keywords in Flash Help. Because these words are 
reserved, you can’t use them as variable names or in other ways. ActionScript 
always uses them to perform their assigned tasks. As you enter ActionScript in the 
Actions panel, keywords will turn a different color. This is a great way to know if a 
word is reserved by Flash.
arguments
Arguments provide specific details for a particular command and are the values 
between parentheses () in a line of code. For example, in the code gotoAndPlay(3);
the argument instructs the script to go to frame 3.
Function
A function is a group of statements that you can refer to by name. Using a function 
makes it possible to run the same set of statements without having to type them 
repeatedly. 
objects
In ActionScript 3.0, you work with objects, which are abstract types of data 
that help you do certain tasks. A Sound object, for example, helps you control 
sound, and a Date object can help you manipulate time-related data. The button 
symbols that you created earlier in this lesson are also objects—they are called 
SimpleButton objects.
P Note: Variable 
names must be unique, 
and they are case-
sensitive. The variable 
mypassword is not the 
same as the variable 
MyPassword. Variable 
names can contain 
only numbers, letters, 
and underscores; they 
cannot begin with a 
number. These are the 
same naming rules 
that apply to instances. 
(In fact, variables 
and instances are 
conceptually the same.)

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 219
Every object should be named. An object that has a name can be referenced and 
controlled with ActionScript. Buttons on the Stage are referred to as instances, 
and in fact, instances and objects are synonymous.
Methods
Methods are commands that result in action. Methods are the doers of 
ActionScript, and each kind of object has its own set of methods. Understanding 
ActionScript involves learning the methods for each kind of object. For example, 
two methods associated with a MovieClip object are stop() and gotoAndPlay().
Properties
Properties describe an object. For example, the properties of a movie clip include 
its height and width, x and y coordinates, and horizontal and vertical scale. Many 
properties can be changed, whereas other properties can only be “read,” meaning 
they simply describe an object.
Using proper scripting syntax
If you’re unfamiliar with program code or scripting, you may find ActionScript 
code challenging to decipher. Once you understand the basic syntax, which is the 
grammar and punctuation of the language, you’ll find it easier to follow a script.
• The semicolon at the end of the line tells ActionScript that it has reached the 
end of the code line.
• As in English, every open parenthesis must have a corresponding close 
parenthesis, and the same is true for brackets and curly brackets. If you open 
something, you must close it. Very often, the curly brackets in ActionScript 
code will be separated on different lines. This makes it easier to read what’s 
inside the curly brackets.
• The dot operator (.) provides a way to access the properties and methods of an 
object. Type the instance name, followed by a dot, and then the name of the 
property or method. Think of the dot as a way to separate objects, methods, 
and properties.
• Whenever you’re entering a string, use quotation marks. 
• You can add comments to remind you or others of what you are accomplishing 
with different parts of the script. To add a comment for a single line, start 
it with two slashes (//). To type a multiline comment, start it with /* and 
end it with */. Comments are ignored by Flash and won’t affect your code at all.

220 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
Flash provides assistance in the following ways as you write scripts in the 
Actions panel:
• Words that have specific meanings in ActionScript, such as keywords and 
statements, appear in blue as you type them in the Actions panel. Words that 
are not reserved in ActionScript, such as variable names, appear in black. 
Strings appear in green. Comments, which ActionScript ignores, appear in gray.
• As you work in the Actions panel, Flash detects the action you are entering and 
displays a code hint. There are two types of code hints: a tooltip that contains 
the complete syntax for that action and a pop-up menu that lists possible 
ActionScript elements. 
• To check the syntax of a script you’ve completed, click the Check Syntax icon  
(
). Syntax errors are listed in the Compiler Errors panel. 
You can also click the AutoFormat icon (
) (which will also format the script 
according to conventions to make it easier for others to read). 
navigating the actions panel
The Actions panel is where you write all your code. Open the Actions panel by 
choosing Window > Actions or by selecting a keyframe on the Timeline and click-
ing the ActionScript panel icon (
) on the top right of the Properties inspector. 
You can also right-click/Ctrl-click on any keyframe and select Actions.
The Actions panel gives you quick access to the core elements of ActionScript as 
well as provides you with different options to help you write, debug, format, edit, 
and find your code.
The Actions panel is divided into several panes. At the top-left corner is the 
Actions toolbox, which contains categories that organize all the ActionScript code. 
At the top of the Actions toolbox is a pull-down menu that displays only the code 
for the version of ActionScript you select. You should select ActionScript 3.0, 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 221
the latest version. At the very bottom of the Actions toolbox categories is a yellow 
Index category that lists, in alphabetical order, all the language elements. You don’t 
need to use the toolbox to add code to your script, but it can help to ensure that 
you’re using the code correctly. 
At the top right of the Actions panel is the Script pane—the blank slate in which all 
your code appears. You enter ActionScript in the Script pane just as you would in a 
text-editing application.
At the bottom left of the Actions panel is the Script navigator, which can help 
you find a particular piece of code. ActionScript is placed on keyframes on the 
Timeline, so the Script navigator can be particularly useful if you have lots of code 
scattered in different keyframes and on different Timelines.
All the panes in the Actions panel can be resized to suit your working style. They 
can even be collapsed completely to maximize the pane that you are working in. 
To resize a pane, click and drag the horizontal or vertical dividers.
Preparing the timeline
Every new Flash project begins with just a single frame. To create room on the 
Timeline to add more content, you’ll have to add more frames to all your layers.
1 Select a later frame in the top layer. In this example, select frame 50.
2 Choose Insert > Timeline > Frame (F5). You can also right-click/Ctrl-click and 
choose Insert Frame.
Flash adds frames in the top layer up to the selected point, frame 50.
3 Select frame 50 in the other two layers and insert frames up to the selected frame.
All your layers have 50 frames on the Timeline.

222 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
adding a Stop action
Now that you have frames on the Timeline, your movie will play linearly from 
frame 1 to frame 50. However, with this interactive restaurant guide, you’ll want 
your viewers to choose a restaurant to see in whichever order they choose. So you’ll 
need to pause the movie at the very first frame to wait for your viewer to click a 
button. You use a stop action to pause your Flash movie. A stop action simply stops 
the movie from continuing by halting the playhead. 
1 Insert a new layer at the top and rename it actions.
2 Select the first keyframe of the actions layer and open the Actions panel 
(Window > Actions).
3 In the Script pane, type stop();
The code appears in the Script pane and a tiny lowercase “a” appears in the first 
keyframe of the actions layer to indicate it contains some ActionScript. The 
movie will now stop at frame 1.
Creating event Handlers for Buttons
Events are occurrences that happen in the Flash environment that Flash can detect 
and respond to. For example, a mouse click, a mouse movement, and a key press 
on the keyboard are all events. A pinch and a swipe gesture on mobile devices are 
also events. These events are produced by the user, but some events can hap-
pen independently of the user, like the successful loading of a piece of data or the 
completion of a sound. With ActionScript, you can write code that detects events 
and respond to them with an event handler.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 223
The first step in event handling is to create a listener that will detect the event. 
A listener looks something like this:
wheretolisten.addEventListener(whatevent, responsetoevent);
The actual command is addEventListener(). The other words are placeholders 
for objects and parameters for your situation. Wheretolisten is the object where 
the event occurs (often a button), whatevent is the specific kind of event (such as a 
mouse click), and responsetoevent is the name of a function that is triggered when 
the event happens. So if you want to listen for a mouse click over a button called 
btn1_btn, and the response is to trigger a function called showimage1, the code 
would look like this:
btn1_btn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, showimage1);
The next step is to create the function that will respond to the event—in this case, 
the function called showimage1. A function simply groups a bunch of actions 
together; you can then trigger that function by referencing its name. A function 
looks something like this:
function showimage1 (myEvent:MouseEvent){ };
Function names, like button names, are arbitrary. You can name functions what-
ever makes sense to you. In this particular example, the name of the function is 
showimage1. It receives one parameter (within the parentheses) called myEvent, 
which is an event that involves the mouse. The item following the colon indicates 
what type of object it is. If this function is triggered, all the actions between the 
curly brackets are executed. 
adding the event listener and function 
You’ll add ActionScript code to listen for a mouse click on each button. The response 
will make Flash go to a particular frame on the Timeline to show different content.
1
Select the first frame of the actions layer.
2
Open the Actions panel.
3
In the Script pane of the Actions panel, beginning on the second line, type
gabelloffel_btn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, 
restaurant1);
The listener listens for a mouse click over the gabelloffel_btn object on the 
Stage. If the event happens, the function called restaurant1 is triggered.

224 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
Mouse events
The following list contains the ActionScript codes for common mouse events for 
the desktop. Use these codes when you create your listener, and make sure that 
you pay attention to lowercase and uppercase letters. For most users, the first event 
(MouseEvent.CLICK) will be sufficient for all projects. That event happens when 
the user presses and releases the mouse button. 
• 
MouseEvent.CLICK
• 
MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE
• 
MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN
• 
MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP
• 
MouseEvent.MOUSE_OVER
• 
MouseEvent.MOUSE_OUT
For a complete list of all the events available for a button, check out the Flash Help 
files and look for the Events of the SimpleButton class.
4 On the next line of the Script pane, type
function restaurant1(event:MouseEvent):void {
 gotoAndStop(10);
}
The function called restaurant1 contains instructions to go to frame 10 and stop 
there. The code for your button called gabelloffel_btn is complete.
5 On the next line of the Script pane, enter additional code for the remaining 
three buttons. You can copy and paste lines 2 through 5, and simply change 
the names of the button, the name of the function (in two places), and the 
destination frame. The full script should be as follows:
stop();
gabelloffel_btn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, 
restaurant1);
function restaurant1(event:MouseEvent):void {
 gotoAndStop(10);
}
P Note: The void 
term refers to the data 
type that is returned 
by the function. Void 
means that nothing is 
returned. Sometimes, 
after functions are 
executed, they “return” 
data, such as doing 
some calculations and 
returning an answer.
P Note: Be sure 
to include the final 
curly bracket for each 
function, or the code 
won’t work.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 225
garygari_btn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, restaurant2);
function restaurant2(event:MouseEvent):void {
 gotoAndStop(20);
}
ilpiatto_btn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, restaurant3);
function restaurant3(event:MouseEvent):void {
 gotoAndStop(30);
}
pierreplatters_btn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, 
restaurant4);
function restaurant4(event:MouseEvent):void {
 gotoAndStop(40);
}
actionScript Commands  
for navigation
The following list contains the ActionScript codes for common navigation com-
mands. Use these codes when you create buttons to stop the playhead, start the 
playhead, or move the playhead to different frames on the Timeline. The gotoAnd-
Stop and gotoAndPlay commands require additional information, or arguments, 
within their parentheses as indicated.
•
stop();
•
play();
•
gotoAndStop(framenumber or "framelabel");
•
gotoAndPlay(framenumber or "framelabel");
•
nextFrame();
•
prevFrame(); 
Checking syntax and formatting code
ActionScript can be very picky, and a single misplaced period can cause your entire 
project to grind to a halt. Fortunately, the Actions panel provides a few tools to 
help you identify errors and fix them.
1 Select the first frame of your actions layer and open the Actions panel if it is not 
already open.

226 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
2 Click the Check Syntax button at the top of the Actions panel. 
Flash checks the syntax of your ActionScript code. In the Compiler Errors panel 
(Window > Compiler Errors), Flash notifies you if there are errors or if your code 
is error-free. You should get 0 Errors and 0 Warnings if your code is correct.
3 Click the AutoFormat icon at the top of the Actions panel.
Flash formats your code so it conforms to standard spacing and line breaks.
Creating Destination Keyframes
When the user clicks each button, Flash moves the playhead to a new spot on 
the Timeline according to the ActionScript instructions you just programmed. 
However, you haven’t yet placed anything different at those particular frames. 
That’s the next step.
inserting keyframes with different content
You will create four keyframes in a new layer and place information about each of 
the restaurants in the new keyframes.
1 Insert a new layer at the top of the layer stack but below the actions layer and 
rename it content.
2 Select frame 10 of the content layer. 
P Note: Change the 
automatic formatting 
by selecting Preferences 
from the upper-right 
options menu. Choose 
Auto Format from the 
left menu and select 
the various options for 
formatting your code.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 227
3 Insert a new keyframe at frame 10 (Insert > Timeline > Keyframe, or F6).
4 Insert new keyframes at frames 20, 30, and 40.
Your Timeline has four empty keyframes in the content layer.
5  Select the keyframe at frame 10.
6 In the Library panel, expand the folder called restaurant content. Drag the 
symbol called gabel and loffel from the Library panel to the Stage. The symbol 
named gabel and loffel is a movie clip symbol that contains a photo, graphics, 
and text about the restaurant.

228 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
7 In the Properties inspector, set the X value to 60 and the Y value to 150.
The restaurant information about gabel and loffel is centered on the Stage and 
covers all the buttons.
8 Select the keyframe at frame 20.
9 Drag the symbol called gary gari from the Library panel to the Stage. The 
symbol named gary gari is another movie clip symbol that contains a photo, 
graphics, and text about this restaurant. 
10 In the Properties inspector, set the X value to 60 and the Y value to 150.
11 Place each of the movie clip symbols from the restaurant content folder in the 
Library panel to the corresponding keyframes in the content layer.
Each keyframe should contain a different movie clip symbol about a restaurant.
Using labels on keyframes
Your ActionScript code tells Flash to go to a different frame number when the user 
clicks each of the buttons. However, if you decide to edit your Timeline and add or 
delete a few frames, you’ll need to go back into your ActionScript and change your 
code so the frame numbers match.
An easy way to avoid this problem is to use frame labels instead of fixed frame 
numbers. Frame labels are names that you give to keyframes. Instead of referring 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 229
to keyframes by their frame number, you refer to them by their label. So, even if 
you move your destination keyframes as you edit, the labels remain with their 
keyframes. To reference frame labels in ActionScript, you must enclose them in 
quotation marks. The command gotoAndStop("label1") makes the playhead go 
to the keyframe with the label called label1.
1 Select frame 10 on the content layer.
2 In the Properties inspector, enter label1 in the Label Name field. 
A tiny flag icon appears on each of the keyframes that have labels.
3 Select frame 20 on the content layer.
4 In the Properties inspector, enter label2 in the Label Name field. 
5 Select frames 30 and 40, and in the Properties inspector, enter corresponding 
names in the Label Name field: label3 and label4.
A tiny flag icon appears on each of the keyframes that have labels.
6  Select the first frame of the actions layer and open the Actions panel.

230 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
7 In your ActionScript code, change all the fixed frame numbers in each of the 
gotoAndStop() commands to the corresponding frame labels:
•
gotoAndStop(10); should be changed to gotoAndStop("label1");
•
gotoAndStop(20); should be changed to gotoAndStop("label2");
•
gotoAndStop(30); should be changed to gotoAndStop("label3");
•
gotoAndStop(40); should be changed to gotoAndStop("label4");
The ActionScript code now directs the playhead to a particular frame label 
instead of a particular frame number.
8 Test your movie by choosing Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
Each button moves the playhead to a different labeled keyframe on the 
Timeline, where a different movie clip is displayed. The user can choose to see 
any restaurant in any order. However, since the restaurant information covers 
the buttons, you can’t return to the original menu screen to choose another 
restaurant. You’ll need to provide another button to return to the first frame, 
which you’ll do in the next section.
Creating a Home Button with Code Snippets
A home button simply makes the playhead go back to the first frame of the 
Timeline, or to a keyframe where an original set of choices, or the main menu, are 
presented to the viewer. Creating a button that goes to frame 1 is the same process 
as creating the four restaurant buttons. However, in this section, you’ll learn to use 
the Code Snippets panel to add ActionScript to your project.
adding another button instance
A home, or main menu, button is provided for you in the Library panel.
1 Select the Buttons layer and unlock it if it is locked.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 231
2 Drag the button called mainmenu from the Library panel to the Stage. Position 
the button instance at the top-right corner.
3 In the Properties inspector, set the X value to 726 and the Y value to 60.
Using the Code Snippets panel to add actionScript
The Code Snippets panel provides common ActionScript code that makes it easy 
for you to add interactivity to your Flash project, and simplifies the process. If you 
are unsure of your ability to code your own buttons, you can use the Code Snippets 
panel to learn how to add interactivity. The Code Snippets panel gives you a pre-
view of the actual code, allows you to modify the critical parameters of the code, 
and use a visual pointer, called the pick whip, to point to objects on the Stage.
You can also save, import, and share code between a team of developers to make 
the development and production process more efficient.
1 Select the first frame of the actions layer in your Timeline. Choose Window > 
Code Snippets, or if your Actions panel is already open, click the Code Snippets 
button (
) at the top right of the Actions panel. 
The Code Snippets panel appears. The code snippets are organized in folders 
that describe their function.

2 In the Code Snippets panel, expand the folder called Timeline Navigation and 
select Click to Go to Frame and Stop.
Immediately to the right of the code snippet name you’ll find a description 
button and a code button.
3 Click the description button.
A brief description of the selected code appears.
4 Click the code button. 
The actual code appears. There is a commented portion of the code that 
describes the function of the code and the different parameters. The colored 
parts of the code are the parts that you need to change.
5 Move your mouse over the blue words instance_name_here.
6 Click and drag your cursor from the blue code words to the Home button on 
the Stage.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 233
A purple line extends from the Code Snippets panel to the Home button. The 
Home button becomes highlighted with a yellow border, indicating that the 
selected code snippet will be applied to it.
If you point your pick whip to an object that doesn’t support the particular code 
snippet, a circular icon with a diagonal line appears (the international “no” symbol).
7 Release your mouse cursor.
Since you have not yet named the Home button, a dialog box appears to allow 
you to give a name to the instance. Enter home_btn for the instance name and 
click OK.
The instance name of the Home button is added to the code.

234 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
If you pointed your pick whip to an object that doesn’t support the particular code 
snippet, your pick whip will rebound and the code snippet will remain unmodified.
8 Highlight the blue number within the parentheses in the code.
The blue number indicates which frame of the Timeline that Flash will display 
when you click on the Home button.
9 Replace the blue number with the number 1.
10 Click Insert.
Flash adds the code snippet to the current keyframe on the Timeline. A flag 
appears on the Timeline to let you know that the code has been added, and to 
indicate where on the Timeline it’s been placed.
Click on the flag to open the Actions panel to view the code. You should be familiar 
with the syntax since you hand-coded your restaurant buttons earlier in this lesson. 
The Code Snippets panel, however, can make adding code quick and easy.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 235
Code Snippets options
Using the Code Snippets panel not only makes adding interactivity quick and 
learning code easy, but it can help organize frequently used code for yourself and 
for a team working on the same project. There are additional options in the Code 
Snippets panel for saving your own code and sharing your code with others.
Creating your own code snippet
If you have your own ActionScript code that you’ll use repeatedly, you can store it 
in the Code Snippets panel and apply it in other projects easily.
1 Open the Code Snippets panel, if it isn’t already open. 
2 From the Options menu at the upper right of the panel, choose Create New 
Code Snippet. 
The Create New Code Snippet dialog box appears.
3 Enter a title in the Title field and a description in the Description field for your 
new code snippet. In the Code field, enter the ActionScript you want to save. 
Use the term instance_name_here for any placeholder instance names and be 
sure to check the option below the Code field. 

236 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
4 Click OK. 
Your code is saved in the Code Snippets panel under a Custom folder. You can 
now access your code and apply it to future projects.
Sharing your code snippet
Soon, you may accumulate a large library of useful code snippets that you want 
to share with other developers. It’s easy to export your custom code snippets and 
enable other Flash developers to import them into their own Code Snippets panel.
1 Open the Code Snippets panel, if it isn’t already open. 
2 From the Options menu at the upper right of the panel, choose Export Code 
Snippets XML. 
In the Save file dialog box that appears, choose a file name and a destination, 
and click OK. All the code snippets from your Code Snippets panel (the default 
ones as well as your own custom snippets) are saved in an XML file that can be 
distributed to other developers on your team.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 237
3 To import custom code snippets, choose Import Code Snippets XML from the 
Options menu in the Code Snippets panel. 
Choose the XML file that contains the custom snippets and click Open. Your 
Code Snippets panel will now contain all the snippets from the XML file.
Playing animation at the Destination
So far, this interactive restaurant guide works by using the gotoAndStop() com-
mand to show information in different keyframes along the Timeline. But how 
would you play an animation after a user clicks a button? One way is to use the 
command gotoAndPlay(), which moves the playhead to the frame number or 
frame label specified by its parameter and plays from that point. 
Creating transition animations
Next, you will create a short transition animation for each of the restaurant guides. 
Then you’ll change your ActionScript code to direct Flash to go to each of the key-
frames and play the animation.
1 Move the playhead to the label1 frame label.

238 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
2 Right-click/Ctrl-click on the instance of the restaurant information on the Stage 
and choose Create Motion Tween.
Flash creates a separate Tween layer for the instance so that it can proceed with 
the motion tween.
3 In the Properties inspector, select Alpha from the Style pull-down menu in the 
Color Effect section.
4 Set the Alpha slider to 0%.
The instance on the Stage becomes totally transparent.
5 Move the playhead to the end of the tween span at frame 19.
6 Select the transparent instance on the Stage.
7 In the Properties inspector, set the Alpha slider to 100%.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 239
The instance is displayed at a normal opacity level. The motion tween from 
frame 10 to frame 19 shows a smooth fade-in effect.
8 Create similar motion tweens for the remaining restaurants in the keyframes 
labeled label2, label3, and label4.
P Note: Recall that 
you can use the Motion 
Presets panel to save 
a motion tween and 
apply it to other objects 
to save you time and 
effort. Select the first 
motion tween on the 
Timeline and click Save 
selection as preset. Once 
saved, you can apply the 
same motion tween to 
another instance.

240 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
Using the gotoandPlay command
The gotoAndPlay command makes the Flash playhead move to a specific frame on 
the Timeline and begin playing from that point.
1 Select the first frame of the actions layer and open the Actions panel.
2 In your ActionScript code, change all the first four gotoAndStop() commands 
to gotoAndPlay() commands. Leave the parameter unchanged:
•
gotoAndStop("label1"); should be changed to 
gotoAndPlay("label1");
•
gotoAndStop("label2"); should be changed to 
gotoAndPlay("label2");
•
gotoAndStop("label3"); should be changed to 
gotoAndPlay("label3");
•
gotoAndStop("label4"); should be changed to 
gotoAndPlay("label4");
For each of the restaurant buttons, the ActionScript code now directs the 
playhead to a particular frame label and begins playing at that point.
Make sure you keep the function for your Home button unchanged. You’ll want 
that function to remain a gotoAndStop() command.
Stopping the animations
If you test your movie now (Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional), you’ll see 
that each button goes to its corresponding frame label and plays from that point, 
but it keeps playing, showing all the remaining animations in the Timeline. The 
next step is to tell Flash when to stop. 
1 Select frame 19 of the actions layer, the frame just before the label2 keyframe on 
the content layer.
P Note: A fast and 
easy way of doing 
multiple replacements 
is to use the Find and 
Replace command in 
the Actions panel. From 
the options menu in 
the upper-right corner, 
select Find and Replace.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 241
2 Right-click/Ctrl-click and choose Insert Keyframe.
A new keyframe is inserted in frame 19 of the actions layer.
3 Open the Actions panel.
The Script pane in the Actions panel is blank. Don’t panic! Your code has 
not disappeared. Your code for the event listeners is on the first keyframe of 
the actions layer. You have selected a new keyframe in which you will add a 
stop command.
4 In the Script pane, enter stop();
If you wish, you could also use the Code Snippets panel to add the stop command.
Flash will stop playing when it reaches frame 19.
5 Insert keyframes at frames 29, 39, and 50.
6 In each of those keyframes, add a stop command in the Actions panel.
7 Test your movie by choosing Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
Each button takes you to a different keyframe and plays a short fade-in 
animation. At the end of the animation, the movie stops and waits for the 
viewer to click the Home button.
E Tip: If you want a 
quick and easy way to 
duplicate the keyframe 
containing the stop 
command, hold down 
the Alt/Option key while 
you move it to a new 
location on the Timeline.

242 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
animated Buttons
Currently, when you hover your mouse cursor over one of the restaurant buttons, 
the gray additional information box suddenly appears. But imagine if that gray 
information box were animated. It would give more life and sophistication to the 
interaction between the user and the button. 
Animated buttons display an animation in the Up, Over, or Down keyframes. 
The key to creating an animated button is to create an animation inside a movie 
clip symbol, and then place that movie clip symbol inside the Up, Over, or Down 
keyframes of a button symbol. When one of those button keyframes is displayed, 
the animation in the movie clip plays.
Creating the animation in a movie clip symbol
Your button symbols in this interactive restaurant guide already contain a movie 
clip symbol of a gray information box in their Over states. You will edit each movie 
clip symbol to add an animation inside it. 
1 In the Library panel, expand the restaurant previews folder. Double-click the 
movie clip symbol icon for gabel loffel over info.
Flash puts you in symbol-editing mode for the movie clip symbol called gabel 
loffel over info.
2 Select all the visual elements on the Stage (Ctrl/Command+A).
3 Right-click/Ctrl-click and choose Create Motion Tween.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessIonAL Cs6 CLAssroom In A book 243
4 In the dialog box that appears asking for confirmation to convert the selection 
to a symbol, click OK.
Flash creates a Tween layer and adds one second worth of frames to the movie 
clip Timeline.
5 Drag the end of the tween span back so the Timeline only has 10 frames.
6 Move the playhead to frame 1 and select the instance on the Stage.
7 In the Properties inspector, select Alpha from the Style pull-down menu in the 
Color Effect section and set the Alpha slider to 0%.
The instance on the Stage becomes totally transparent.
8 Move the playhead to the end of the tween span at frame 10.
9 Select the transparent instance on the Stage.
10 In the Properties inspector, set the Alpha slider to 100%.
Flash creates a smooth transition between the transparent and opaque instance 
in the 10 frame tween span.
11 Insert a new layer and rename it actions.
12 Insert a new keyframe in the last frame (frame 10) of the actions layer.
13 Open the Actions panel (Window > Actions) and enter stop(); in the Script pane.
Adding the stop action in the last frame ensures that the fade-in effect plays 
only once.
14 Exit symbol-editing mode by clicking the Scene 1 button above the Stage.

244 
Lesson 6 
Creating Interactive navigation
15 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
When your mouse cursor hovers over the first restaurant button, the gray 
information box fades in. The motion tween inside the movie clip symbol plays 
the fade-in effect, and the movie clip symbol is placed in the Over state of the 
button symbol.
16 Create identical motion tweens for the other gray information box movie clips 
so that all the restaurant buttons are animated. 
P Note: If you want 
an animated button to 
repeat its animation, 
leave out the stop 
command at the end of 
the movie clip’s Timeline.

review answers
1 ActionScript code resides in keyframes on the Timeline. Keyframes that contain 
ActionScript are indicated by a small lowercase “a.” You add ActionScript through 
the Actions panel. Choose Window > Actions, or select a keyframe and click the 
ActionScript panel icon in the Properties inspector, or right-click/Ctrl-click and 
select Actions. You enter code directly in the Script pane in the Actions panel, or you 
can select commands from the categories in the Actions toolbox. You can also add 
ActionScript through the Code Snippets panel.
2 To name an instance, select it on the Stage, and then type in the Instance Name field 
in the Properties inspector. You need to name an instance so that ActionScript can 
identify it with code.
3 To label a frame, select a keyframe on the Timeline, and then type a name in the Frame 
Label box in the Properties inspector. You can label frames in Flash to make it easier to 
reference frames in ActionScript and to give you more flexibility.  
4 A function is a group of statements that you can refer to by name. Using a function makes 
it possible to run the same set of statements without having to type them repeatedly into 
the same script. When an event is detected, a function is executed in response.
5 An event is an occurrence that is initiated by a button click, a keystroke, or any 
number of inputs that Flash can detect and respond to. An event listener, also called 
an event handler, is a function that is executed in response to specific events.
6 Animated buttons display an animation in the Up, Over, or Down keyframes. To create 
an animated button, make an animation inside a movie clip symbol, and then place that 
movie clip symbol inside the Up, Over, or Down keyframes of a button symbol. When 
one of those button keyframes is displayed, the animation in the movie clip plays.

Words are integral to any Flash site. Learn how to 
use the Text Layout Framework to create titles,  
sophisticated layouts, and dynamic text content 
that can change to suit different situations.

248 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
getting started
To begin, view the finished project to see the different kinds of text elements that 
you’ll create in this lesson. 
1 Double-click the 07End.html file in the Lesson07/07End folder to play the 
animation.
The finished project is an interactive real estate site for the imaginary city 
of Meridien, whose restaurant guide you completed in the previous lesson. 
Viewers can read about the featured property and its neighborhood or 
figure out how much they can afford to pay every month using the mortgage 
calculator at the bottom right. Enter a new rate, a new value for the percent 
down, and click the Calculate button to display the estimated monthly payment.
2 Close the 07End.html file. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 249
3 Double-click the 07Start.fla file in the Lesson07/07Start folder to open the initial 
project file in Flash.
The Stage already includes some simple design elements to divide the space, 
with several assets already created and stored in the Library panel.
4 Choose File > Save As. Name the file 07_workingcopy.fla and save it in the 
07Start folder. Saving a working copy ensures that the original Start file will be 
available if you want to start over. 
Understanding TLF Text
Flash Professional CS6 uses two different text options. When you choose the Text 
tool (
) in the Tools panel to add text to the Stage, you choose either TLF Text or 
Classic Text. 

250 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
TLF text stands for Text Layout Framework, and is a more recent and more power-
ful text engine. Choose TLF Text when you want to use more sophisticated controls 
for text formatting such as multiple columns or wrap-around text. You’ll learn 
many of the features unique to TLF Text in this lesson. Choose Classic Text when 
you don’t need that degree of layout control or if you need to target an older ver-
sion of the Flash Player.
TLF Text depends on a specific external ActionScript library to function properly. 
When you test a movie or publish a movie that contains TLF Text, an additional 
Text Layout SWZ file (
) is created next to your SWF file. The SWZ file is the 
external ActionScript library that supports TLF Text.
When a SWF file that contains TLF Text is playing from the Web, the SWF looks 
for the library in a couple of different locations. The SWF looks for the library on 
the local computer it is playing on, where the library is usually cached from normal 
Internet usage. The SWF also looks on Adobe.com for the library file, and if that 
fails, looks in the same directory as the SWF.
You should always keep the SWZ file with your SWF file so the TLF Text features 
work properly when you test your movies locally. You should also have the SWZ file 
accompany your SWF file when you upload it to your Web server, just to be safe.
Merging the TLF Text library
If you don’t want to maintain the separate SWZ file, you can merge the required 
ActionScript library with your SWF file. However, doing so adds substantially to 
the size of your published SWF file and is not recommended.
1 Choose File > Publish Settings. Click the Flash format from the left and 
choose Settings for ActionScript 3.0. You can also click the Edit button next to 
ActionScript settings in the Properties inspector.
The Advanced ActionScript 3.0 Settings dialog box opens. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 251
2 Click on the Library path tab.
3 Click the arrow next to the textLayout.swc listing in the display window.
The arrow points downward, expanding the information about the TLF Text 
feature. Note that the Link Type shows that the file uses a runtime shared 
library, and the URL for the library is on Adobe.com.
4 In the Runtime Shared Library Settings section, choose Merged into code for 
the Default linkage.

252 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
The Link Type changes to Merged into code.
The current Flash file will merge the TLF Text ActionScript library into the 
published SWF if you click OK to accept these settings. For the project in this 
lesson, do not merge the code. Click Cancel to leave the default setting, Link 
Type as a Runtime Shared Library.
Adding simple Text
You’ll start by adding simple, single lines of text for display. Add text to the Stage 
using the Text tool in the Tools panel. When you add text, whether TLF Text or 
Classic Text, the text remains fully editable. So at any point after you create your 
text, you can return to it and change it or any of its properties, such as its color, 
font, size, or alignment.
As with other Flash elements, it’s best to separate text on its own layer to keep your 
layers organized. Having text on its own layer also makes it easy to select, move, or 
edit your text without disturbing the items in the layers below or above it.
Adding the titles
You’ll add titles to various sections of the real estate site and learn about the  
different formatting and style options.
1 Select the banner layer and click the New Layer button. Rename it text.
2 Select the Text tool.
P Note: You can break 
apart text (Modify > 
Break Apart) to convert 
each letter into separate 
drawing objects whose 
stroke and fill you can 
modify. However, once 
broken apart, your 
text will no longer 
be editable.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 253
3 In the Properties inspector, select TLF Text and Read Only. In the Character 
section, choose Times New Roman for Family, Bold for Style, 20.0 for Size, 14.0 
pt for Leading, and black for Color.
You may choose a similar font if Times New Roman is unavailable on your 
computer. For TLF Text, you have the option of choosing Read Only, Selectable, 
or Editable. 
•
Read Only displays text that can’t be selected or edited by the end user.
•
Selectable displays text that the user can select to copy.
•
Editable displays text that the user can select and edit. Use the Editable 
option for text input fields, such as login and passwords. You’ll use the 
Editable option later in this lesson to create the Mortgage Calculator.
4 Click the top-left corner of the Stage where you want to begin adding text. 
Begin entering the address of the featured property, 198 7th Avenue, South 
Slope. Exit the Text tool by choosing the Selection tool.

P Note: The registration 
of text is at the top-left 
corner of the text box.
P Note: You can also 
click and drag with the 
Text tool to define a 
text box at a set width 
and height. You can 
always change the 
dimensions of the text 
box to accommodate 
your text.

10 Position the About the Neighborhood title at X=70 and Y=460. Position the 
Mortgage Calculator title at X=480 and Y=460.
Creating vertical text
Although vertical text is not common, it can be useful for unusual displays. For 
many Asian languages, vertical text is essential to display them correctly. In this 
lesson, you’ll use a vertical orientation for the overall banner title.
1 Deselect any selected text and choose the Text tool.
2 In the Properties inspector, select TLF Text and Read Only. In the Character 
section, choose Arial Narrow for Family, Regular for Style, 38.0 for Size, and

3 From the orientation pull-down menu, choose Vertical.
4 Click on the black vertical banner to place the beginning of your text and enter 
the banner title Meridien Real Estate Live Your Dream.
Modifying characters
Use the Character and Advanced Character options in the Properties inspector to 
modify the way your text appears. You’ve already used different colors, font fami-
lies, font sizes, and orientations. Now you’ll explore some less obvious options.
1 Double-click the top address and select the “th” characters.
P Note: In the 
Character section of the 
Properties inspector, 
you can choose 270° to 
change the orientation 
of the individual 
characters as well as the 
lines of text.

8 Select the last three words of the banner title, Live Your Dream.
9 In the Properties inspector, change the font size to 22 and Baseline Shift to 6.0.
The selected words in the banner title become smaller and are shifted upward 
from their baseline. The variations in size and baseline shift in the banner title 
create a more pleasing design.

260 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
Adding Multiple Columns
Now you’ll add the text description of the property and some details about the 
neighborhood. The text will appear in different columns. For the property details, 
you’ll add a three-column text description, and for the neighborhood, you’ll add a 
two-column text description.
1 Deselect any selected text and choose the Text tool.
2 In the Properties inspector, select TLF Text and Read Only. In the Character 
section, choose Times New Roman for Family, Bold for Style, 14.0 for Size, 
16.0 pt for Leading, and black for Color. Make sure you switch back to 
horizontal text.
3 Click on the top horizontal banner below the address and drag out a long text 
box to define the width and height of the text.
4 In the Container and Flow section of the Properties inspector, enter 3 for the 
Columns option.
Your selected text box becomes enabled to display three columns.

5 Enter text in the text box that provides details of this hypothetical property, 
such as the number of rooms, number of beds, and so on. Press Return 
or Enter after each line. You can copy the information from the text file 
07SampleRealEstateText1.txt in the 07Start folder.
The text is displayed in three columns. As text in the first column reaches the 
bottom of the text box, the next line appears at the top of the next column.
6 Exit the Text tool by choosing the Selection tool, and click an empty part of the 
Stage to deselect the text.
7 Select the Text tool again. Now you’ll create the text for the About the 
Neighborhood section.
8 In the Properties inspector, select TLF Text and Read Only. In the Character 
section, choose Times New Roman for Family, Regular for Style, 12.0 for Size, 
12.0 pt for Leading, and black for Color.
9 Click on the bottom green bar below the About the Neighborhood title and 
drag out a text box so that it takes up most of the light green space.
10 In the Container and Flow section of the Properties 
inspector, enter 2 for the Columns option.
Your selected text box becomes enabled to display 
two columns.

262 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
11 Open the text file 07SampleRealEstateText1.txt in the 07Start folder if it’s not 
already open. Copy the Latin placeholder text in the About the Neighborhood 
section and paste it into the two-column text box.
The text is displayed in two columns. As text in the first column reaches the 
bottom of the text box, the next line appears at the top of the next column.
Modifying the text box
If your text doesn’t entirely fit in its text box, Flash displays a red cross at the 
bottom-right corner. The red cross means there is overflow text that is not visible.
To see more of the text, you can enlarge the text box. 
1 Select the Text tool or the Selection tool.
2 Move your mouse cursor over one of the solid blue squares surrounding the 
text box. 
Your mouse cursor changes to a double-headed arrow, indicating the direction 
in which you can modify the size of the text box.
3 Click and drag to make the text box wider or taller to fit the text.
The text box gets resized, and the text reflows to accommodate the new 
dimensions.
P Note: In the 
Container and Flow 
section of the Properties 
inspector, you can 
also modify the gutter, 
the space between 
columns, and the 
padding between the 
text and the boundaries 
of the text box to help 
you get the exact text 
layout you desire.
P Note: You can also 
resize a text box by 
entering new Width and 
Height values in the 
Properties inspector. 
However, do not resize 
a text box with the 
Transform panel or the 
Free Transform tool. 
Doing so will squash or 
stretch the contents of 
the text box and distort 
the text.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 263
Using the Tab Ruler
All TLF text boxes that you place on the Stage include a ruler at their top edges. 
The ruler measures the left and right margins and indents, as well as tab stops. To 
view the ruler, double-click a TLF text box or select the Text tool and click in a TLF 
text box to begin editing. You can toggle to view or to hide the ruler by choosing 
Text > TLF Tab Ruler. 
Next, you’ll use the TLF Tab Ruler to modify margins, indents, and tab stops. 
1 Double-click the text box if it isn’t already selected.
The TLF Tab Ruler is displayed at the top edge of the text box, above either the 
left or the right column, depending on where your mouse cursor is positioned. 
The TLF Tab Ruler measurements are in pixels.
2 Drag the left margin indicator (solid black triangle) along the TLF Tab Ruler.
The margins for the text increase. The margins are determined for each 
paragraph. If there were paragraph breaks in your text box, you’d see the margin 
for only the selected paragraph change.
Notice how the margin values change in the Properties inspector as well. Move 
the margin indicator back to its original position after you finish exploring how 
it works.
3 You can split the left margin indicator to establish the indent amount for the 
first line of new paragraphs. To see the indents, press the Return or Enter key to 
create a few new paragraphs in the text.
4 Click inside the TLF Tab Ruler.
Flash creates a tab stop.
P Note: If you have 
multiple paragraphs 
and you want to change 
the margins for the 
entire contents of the 
text box, choose Edit > 
Select All, or use the 
mouse to first select all 
the text before moving 
the margin indicator.

Lesson 7 
Using Text
5 Drag the tab stop along the ruler to move the position of the tab.
6 To see the effects of the tab stop, press the Tab key when your cursor is in front 
of new paragraphs.
Flash indents the text to the next tab stop on the TLF Tab Ruler.
Wrapping Text
Long passages of text are visually boring. Instead, if you can wrap text around pho-
tographs or graphic elements, you create more visual interest and a more pleasing 
design. Take a look at any magazine in print or online, and you’ll see how text flows 
around photos to help integrate the elements on the page.
In this section, you’ll add some graphic elements to the real estate site—an ani-
mated slide show and a photo of the real estate agent—and create text that wraps 
around them both. You create wrapping text by linking separate text boxes. Text 
will flow from one text box to another as if in a single container. 
Adding the graphics
The animated slide show and the graphic of the real estate agent have already been 
created and are in the Library panel for you to use. 
1 Insert a new layer and rename it images. Drag the images layer under the 
banner layer.
2 In the Library panel, select the photos movie clip symbol.
P Note: Drag the tab 
stop off the ruler to 
delete it.
P Note: Linked text 
boxes are also referred 
to as “threaded text 
containers.”

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 265
3 Drag the photos movie clip symbol from the Library panel to the Stage. Position 
the movie clip instance at X=0 and Y=230.
The movie clip contains motion tweens of several photographs fading in and 
out. A movie clip’s animation is independent of the main Timeline and plays 
only when you test the movie (Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional).
4 In the Library panel, drag the contact movie clip symbol from the Library panel 
to the Stage. Position the contact movie clip instance at X=620 and Y=175.
The movie clip of the real estate agent and her contact information is a simple 
static graphic.

266 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
Linking the text boxes
Now you’ll arrange several linked text boxes around the graphic elements.
1 Select the Text tool.
2 In the Properties inspector, select TLF Text and Read Only. In the Character 
section, choose Times New Roman for Family, Regular for Style, 14.0 for Size, 
20.0 pt for Leading, and black for Color.
3 Click and drag out the first text box that takes up the space above the photo of 
the bedroom and whose right edge extends to about the middle of the Stage. 
Don’t worry about precise placement at this point because you can always 
adjust the size and location of your text box.
Your first text box is created.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 267
4 Click on the lower-right corner of your text box.
Your cursor changes to an icon of the corner of a text box (
).
5 Click and drag out your second text box just to the right of the photos movie 
clip instance.
When you release your mouse cursor, your second text box becomes linked to 
the first text box. A blue line that connects the first to the second represents 
the linkage.
P Note: If you simply 
click on the Stage to 
define your next linked 
text box, Flash creates a 
text box that is identical 
in size to the previous 
text box.

268 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
6 Click on the empty box on the lower-right corner of your second text box; then click 
and drag out your third text box above the real estate agent contact information.
7 Continue creating linked text boxes until you have five boxes that flow around 
the photo and real estate agent.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 269
Adding content to the linked text boxes
Next, add text to your linked text boxes. Begin with the first text box, and as text 
reaches the limit of one box, it will automatically flow into the next.
1 Open the file 07SampleRealEstateText1.txt from the 07Start folder if it’s not 
already open.
2 Copy the description of the property.
3 Double-click the first text box on the Stage and paste the text.
Click on the Stage outside the text boxes to deselect them and view how your 
text appears as it wraps around the graphics. Adjust the size or location to 
finesse the way your text flows from one box to the next.
P Note: Treat the 
linked text boxes as 
if they were a single 
container. As you add, 
delete, and edit text, 
the contents reflow to 
fit. You can select all 
(Edit > Select All), and 
the contents of all the 
linked text boxes will 
be selected.

270 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
Deleting and inserting text boxes
If you need to edit the way the text flows, you can always delete linked text boxes or 
add new ones, and the linkages between the existing ones will be maintained. 
1 With the Selection tool, select the second linked text box.
2 Press the Delete key on the keyboard.
The second linked text box is deleted from the Stage, but the remaining text 
boxes maintain their linkages. The first text box is now linked to the third at the 
top of the second column. Notice that the last text box shows the red cross at its 
bottom-right corner, indicating overflow text that cannot be displayed.
3 Click on the box containing the small arrowhead on the lower-right corner of 
the first text box. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 271
4 Click and drag out the text box to reestablish the one you just deleted.
A new text box is inserted between the existing linked text boxes, and the text 
reflows to fill the new container.
Breaking and relinking text boxes
You can also break the links between text boxes and create new linkages. 
1 Click on the box containing the small arrowhead on the lower-right corner of 
the first text box (
).
2 Move your mouse cursor over the second text box.
Your cursor changes to a broken link icon (
), indicating that you can break 
the link to the text box that is currently below your cursor.

272 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
3 Click on the second text box. 
The link from the first text box to the second text box is broken. Your text now 
can’t flow out of the first text box.
4 Let’s reestablish the link. Click on the red cross on the lower-right corner of the 
first text box and move your cursor over the second text box.
Your cursor changes to a linked icon (
), indicating that you can establish a 
link to the text box that is currently below your cursor.
5 Click on the second text box. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 273
The first text box is again linked to the second text box. Your text now flows 
throughout the five text boxes. 
Finding the next or Previous Link
Sometimes, if you have multiple linked text boxes, it may be confusing to see the 
linkages or difficult to select the boxes in succession. You can right-click/Ctrl-click 
over any text box and, if it is linked, you can choose Find Previous Link or Find Next 
Link. The previous or next linked text box will become selected.
Hyperlinking Text
The description of the property on the real estate site contains references to several 
landmarks and destinations of interest in Meridien City. You’ll add a hyperlink to 
one of those text references so your users can click it and be directed to a Web site 
with additional information. Hyperlinks are easy to add to text and don’t require 
any HTML or ActionScript coding.

274 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
Adding a hyperlink
1 Double-click the second linked text box on the Stage and select the words 
Avalon Green.
2 In the Advanced Character section of the Properties inspector, enter  
http://www.avalongreen.org for the Link and choose _blank in the Target  
pull-down menu.
The selected words in your text box become underlined, indicating that it is 
hyperlinked.
The Web address is a fictional one. Be sure to include the protocol http://
before any URL to choose a site on the Web. The Target field determines where 
the Web site loads. A _blank Target means that the Web site loads in a blank 
browser window.
P Note: A _self Target 
loads the URL in the 
same browser window, 
taking over your Flash 
movie. A _top and 
_parent Target refers 
to the arrangement of 
a frameset, and loads 
the URL in a particular 
frame relative to the 
current frame.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 275
3 Select the words Avalon Green, and in the Character section of the Properties 
inspector, change the color from black to blue.
The selected words become blue and remain underlined, which is the standard 
visual cue for a hyperlinked item in a browser. However, you are free to display 
your hyperlink in any fashion, just as long as your user can recognize it as a 
clickable item.
4 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. Click the hyperlink.
A browser opens and attempts to load the fictional Web site at www.
avalongreen.org.
Creating User-input Text
Next, you’ll create the mortgage calculator, which accepts input from the user 
through the keyboard and displays estimated monthly payments based on those 
inputs. You create user-input text with Editable TLF Text. User-input text can be 
used to create sophisticated customized interactions that gather information from 
the viewer and tailor the Flash movie based on that information. Examples include 
applications requiring a login and password, surveys and forms, or quizzes.
Adding the static text elements
Start by creating all the text that doesn’t change or can’t be edited—the static  
elements of the mortgage calculator.
1 Select the Text tool.
2 In the Properties inspector, select TLF Text and 
Read Only. In the Character section, choose Times 
New Roman for Family, Regular for Style, 12.0 for 
Size, 12.0 pt for Leading, and black for Color.

276 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
3 Click in the dark brown area under the Mortgage Calculator text and insert 
five separate lines of text for TERM: 30 Year Fixed, PRICE: $350,000, RATE:, 
PERCENT DOWN:, and MONTHLY PAYMENTS:. 
Adding the display fields
For RATE and PERCENT DOWN, you’ll add Editable text boxes so your users can 
enter their own numbers and customize the mortgage calculations to evaluate their 
buying decisions.
1 Select the Text tool.
2 In the Properties inspector, select TLF Text and Editable. Keep the other font 
information the same as the previous text you created.
3 Click and drag out a small text box next to RATE.
4 In the Container and Flow section of the Properties inspector, choose a white 
color and 75% Alpha value for the Fill.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 277
The Editable text box next to Rate displays a semitransparent white background. 
You can also add a stroke to the text box to give it more definition if you desire.
5 Create a second Editable text box next to PERCENT DOWN with the same 
semitransparent white background.
6 Create a third text box next to MONTHLY PAYMENTS with the same 
semitransparent white background, but make this text box Read Only.
The text box next to MONTHLY PAYMENTS is Read Only because it will 
display a number calculated based on the user-inputted RATE and PERCENT 
DOWN. The user does not need to edit the information in that box.
7 In the Editable text box next to RATE, enter 5.25. In the Editable text box next 
to PERCENT DOWN, enter 20.
Entering initial text in Editable text boxes often guides users in knowing what 
kind of text is expected.

278 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
embedding fonts
For any text that may be edited during runtime, you should embed the fonts. Since 
the user can enter any kind of text in Editable text boxes, you need to include those 
potential characters in the final SWF to ensure that text appears as you expect it, 
with the same font that you’ve chosen in the Properties inspector.
1 Select the first Editable text box next to Rate.  
2 In the Character section of the Properties inspector, click the Embed button. 
The Font Embedding dialog box appears. The font that is used in the selected 
text box appears on the left.
3 In the Character ranges section, select Numerals. Click OK.
All the number characters of the current font, Times New Roman Regular, 
will be included in the published SWF. 
P Note: Embedding 
fonts dramatically 
increases the size of your 
final SWF, so exercise 
caution when doing so, 
and limit the number 
of fonts and characters 
when possible.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 279
Device Fonts
Use device fonts as an alternative to embedding fonts. Device fonts are three 
generic options grouped at the top of the Character Family pull-down menu. You 
can also choose the Use device fonts option from the Anti-alias pull-down menu.
The three device fonts are _sans, _serif, and _typewriter. These options find and use 
the fonts on a user’s computer that most closely resemble the specified device font. 
When you use device fonts, you don’t have to worry about embedding fonts, and 
you can be assured that your viewer sees text that is similar to the text you see in 
the authoring environment. 
naming the text boxes
For Flash to control what text to display in a text box or to know what has been 
entered in an Editable text box, the text box must be given an instance name in the 
Properties inspector. Just as you named button instances in Lesson 6, “Creating 
Interactive Navigation,” naming text boxes on the Stage allows ActionScript to 
identify them. The same naming rules apply for text boxes as they do for buttons.
1 Select the first Editable text box next to Rate.
2 In the Properties inspector, enter rate_txt for the instance name.
The suffix _txt is the convention for text boxes.

280 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
3 Select the next Editable text box next to Percent Down.
4 In the Properties inspector, enter down_txt for the instance name.
5 Select the Read Only text box next to Monthly Payments.
6 In the Properties inspector, enter monthly_txt for the instance name.
Changing the contents of text boxes
The contents of a text box are represented by its text property. You can dynami-
cally change a text box’s contents by assigning new text to the text property. In 
this section, you’ll add ActionScript that reads the text entered in the Editable text 
boxes next to Rate and Percent Down, perform some mathematical calculations, 
and then display new text in the Read Only text box next to Monthly Payments.
1 Unlock the calculator layer, select the Calculate button on the Stage, and in the 
Properties inspector, enter calculate_btn for the instance name.
2 Insert a new layer and rename it actionscript.
3 Select the first keyframe of the actionscript layer and open the Actions panel.
4 You must first create a few variables to hold numerical information. The 
variables will help you make the mortgage calculations. Variables are created, 
or “declared,” using the var keyword. Enter the code as follows:
var term:Number=360;
var price:Number=350000;
var monthlypayment:Number;

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 281
5 Create an event listener and function for the Calculate button. You should 
be familiar with event listeners from Lesson 6, but if not, you should review 
the concepts in that lesson before moving on. The event listener and function 
should appear as shown here:
6 Enter code within the function to make the mortgage calculations and display 
the results. The completed code for the event listener and function should be 
as follows:
calculate_btn.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, 
calculatemonthlypayment);
function calculatemonthlypayment(e:MouseEvent):void {
 var loan:Number=price-Number(down_txt.text)/100*price;
 var c:Number=Number(rate_txt.text)/1200;
 monthlypayment = loan*(c*(Math.pow((1+c),term)))/(Math.
pow((1+c),term)-1);
 monthly_txt.text=String(Math.round(monthlypayment));
}
Don’t get too discouraged looking at the code! Take your time to copy it exactly, 
or you can copy and paste it from the 07End.fla file in the 07End folder.
It may look complicated, but there are only two important concepts to identify. First, 
the contents of text boxes are referenced by the text property. So down_txt.text
refers to the contents in the text box named down_txt, and rate_txt.text refers 
to the contents in the text box named rate_txt.
Second, text boxes contain text, or String data. To make numeric calculations, you 
must first convert the text to a number using Number(). To convert a number back 
to text, use String().
The rest of the surrounding code is algebraic manipulation using addition, sub-
traction, multiplication, division, and exponents according to a straightforward 
mortgage payment formula.

282 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
Testing the calculator 
Now test your movie to see how Flash controls the contents of the named text boxes.
1 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
2 In the preview movie that appears, enter new values in the text boxes next to 
RATE and PERCENT DOWN, and then click the Calculate button.
Flash reads the values in the text boxes next to Rate and Percent Down, 
calculates a monthly payment, and displays new text in the text box next to 
MONTHLY PAYMENTS. Try different values to see how much you can afford!
Loading external Text
So far, you’ve created an attractive layout with an interactive tool for this property 
listing for the real estate agent. However, the agent has many more listings, and 
it would be convenient to use the same layout to display the information without 
re-creating it for each property. Fortunately, you can load new text from an external 
file and display it in an existing text box, replacing its contents. To display addi-
tional listings, simply maintain additional text files and load them to be displayed 
as needed. This is an example of dynamic content—content that changes at runtime 
(in the SWF file) rather than being fixed during authortime (in the FLA file).
In this section, you’ll load new content from external text files to replace the prop-
erty address, information, and description.
naming the text boxes
To change the contents of the text boxes, you first need to give them instance 
names so they can be referenced in ActionScript. You’ll provide instance names 
for the address, information, and description of the property listing.
1 Select the text box at the top of the Stage that contains the address of the 
property listing.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 283
2 In the Properties inspector, enter address_txt for the instance name.
3 Select the text box below the address that contains the details of the property listing.
4 In the Properties inspector, enter info_txt for the instance name.
5 Select the first linked text box of the description of the property.
6 In the Properties inspector, enter description_txt for the instance name.

284 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
embedding the fonts
When text changes at runtime, you need to embed all the characters of the font 
that the text would potentially use to make sure that the text displays properly.
1 Select the first text box named address_txt.
2 In the Character section of the Properties inspector, click the Embed button.
The Font Embedding dialog box appears. You can also choose Text > Font 
Embedding to display the dialog box.
3 The font used in the selected text box appears on the left side of the dialog box 
(Times New Roman Bold). In the Character ranges section, select Uppercase, 
Lowercase, Numerals, and Punctuation. Click OK.
The character ranges that you’ve selected will be embedded in the final SWF 
file. Any of the characters in those ranges will display properly in your final 
Flash movie.
4 Select the first linked text box named description_txt.
5 In the Character section of the Properties inspector, click the Embed button.
The Font Embedding dialog box appears. The Numerals for Character range 
should already be selected since you embedded those characters for the 
mortgage calculator.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 285
6 In the Character ranges section, select Uppercase, Lowercase, and Punctuation 
in addition to Numerals. Click OK.
The character ranges that you’ve selected will be embedded in the final SWF 
file. Any of the characters in those ranges will display properly in your final 
Flash movie.
Loading and displaying external text
Information for a second property listing is saved in three additional text files in the 
07Start folder. You’ll add ActionScript to your movie that loads information from 
those text files.
1 Open the file in the 07Start folder called 07SampleRealEstate2-address.txt.
The file contains information about the address of another property listing.
2 Choose Window > Code Snippets.
The Code Snippets panel appears.
P Note: Make sure 
you save external text 
content as a text-only 
file in an application 
such as TextEdit (Mac) or 
Notepad (Windows). Do 
not use Microsoft Word, 
because Word adds 
unnecessary additional 
information to the file 
that interferes with its 
proper loading. If you 
use Word, always choose 
Save As Text Only. 

286 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
3 Expand the Load and Unload folder and double-click the Load External Text option.
A new layer named Actions is automatically inserted in the Timeline, and 
the Actions panel opens to display the inserted code snippet. You’ll need to 
customize some of the code for it to work in this particular project.
4 Replace the URL in line 12 of the code snippet with the filename of the property 
address, 07SampleRealEstate2-address.txt. Make sure you keep the double 
quotation marks surrounding the filename.
The code loads the file 07SampleRealEstate2-address.txt.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 287
5 Replace the trace command in line 19 of the code snippet with the following 
code that assigns the new text to the text box named address_txt:
address_txt.text = textData;
The contents of the text file, 07SampleRealEstate2-address.txt, will be displayed 
in the text box named address_txt.
6 In the Code Snippets panel, double-click the Load External Text option again.
7 A second code snippet appears in the Actions panel that loads a second text file.
8 Replace the URL in line 34 with the filename of the property details, 
07SampleRealEstate2-info.txt, and replace the trace command in line 41 with 
the following code that assigns the new text to the text box named info_txt:
info_txt.text = textData;

288 
Lesson 7 
Using Text
9 In the Code Snippets panel, double-click the Load External Text option a third 
time and make the code replacements to load 07SampleRealEstate2-description.
txt and display the text in description_txt.
The three large blocks of code snippets appear in the Actions panel one after 
the other.
10 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
Flash loads the three external text files and displays the contents of the text files 
in the targeted text boxes. The listing now displays details for a property on 
Cobble Hill Way instead of 7th Avenue.
The photos and mortgage calculator still refer to the previous listing, so the 
update to the new property is unfinished. However, you can still see in this 
incomplete example how flexible it is to develop a template that loads external 
text content and displays it in text boxes on the Stage. Many professional Flash 
projects rely on dynamic content fed from external assets such as text files.

Review Answers
1 The SWZ file is an external ActionScript library that contains information that 
supports TLF Text. If your Flash movie contains TLF Text, it needs the SWZ file to 
function properly. Flash automatically generates the additional file, which should 
always accompany your SWF file.
2 Read Only text is for display purposes and doesn’t allow the user to select or edit the 
text. Selectable text allows the user to select and copy text. Editable text allows the user 
to select, copy, delete, and edit the text. The contents of all three kinds of text can be 
changed dynamically with ActionScript.
3 Fonts should be embedded for any text that may be edited or changed at runtime, 
which means any Editable text box or any text box whose contents dynamically 
changes, except for text that uses device fonts. Choose Text > Font Embedding or click 
the Embed button in the Properties inspector to display the Font Embedding dialog 
box. In the Font Embedding dialog box, you can choose which font, style, and range of 
characters to embed in your Flash movie. 
4 You can wrap text around objects such as photos or graphic elements in a layout 
by creating a series of linked text boxes, sometimes called threaded text containers. 
The links establish how overflow text from one text box flows into the next text box. 
Create the first text box, and then click on the small white box in its lower-right corner. 
After the mouse cursor changes to a text box icon, click and drag to add the next 
linked text box. 
5 A text box’s contents are determined by its text property, which accepts String values. 
To change or access the contents of a text box, you must first give the text box an instance 
name in the Properties inspector. Then, in ActionScript, you can reference the contents of 
the text box with its instance name, followed by a dot, followed by the keyword text.

292 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
getting Started
Start the lesson by viewing the finished animated zoo kiosk. You’ll create the 
kiosk by adding sound and video files to a project in Flash. 
1 Double-click the 08End.html file in the Lesson08/08End folder to play 
the animation.
View the movie of the polar bear with a short soundtrack of an African beat. 
A zoo director introduces himself, and as he speaks, Flash elements appear on 
the stage that are synchronized with his talk. 
2 Click a sound button to hear an animal sound. 
3 Click a thumbnail button to view a short movie about the animal. Use the 
interface controls below the movie to pause, continue, or lower the volume.
In this lesson, you’ll import audio files and put them on the Timeline to provide the 
short introductory audio flourish. You’ll also learn how to embed sounds in each 
button. You’ll use Adobe Media Encoder CS6 to compress and convert the video 
files to the appropriate format for Flash. You’ll learn how to work with transparent 
backgrounds in video to create the silhouetted zoo director video. You’ll also add cue 
points in the video of the zoo director to trigger other Flash animated elements.
1 Double-click the 08Start.fla file in the Lesson08/08Start folder to open the 
initial project file in Flash.
2 Choose File > Save As. Name the file 08_workingcopy.fla, and save it in the 
08Start folder. Saving a working copy ensures that the original start file will be 
available if you want to start over. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 293
understanding the Project File
The initial setup of the project has been completed except for the audio and video 
portions and some of the ActionScript code. The Stage is 1000 x 700 pixels. A row 
of buttons of colorful animals is on the bottom row, another set of buttons on the 
left, a title at the top, and a background image of a resting lion.
The Timeline contains several layers that separate the different content. 
The bottom three layers, called background photo, title, and bottom navbar, con-
tain design elements, text, and images. The next two layers above, called buttons 
and sound buttons, contain instances of button symbols. The videos layer and the 
hilights layer contain several labeled keyframes, and the actions layer contains 
ActionScript that provides the event handlers for the bottom row of buttons.
If you’ve completed Lesson 6, you should be familiar with the structure of this 
Timeline. The individual buttons on the bottom row are already coded so that when 
the user clicks a button, the playhead moves to a corresponding labeled keyframe 
in the videos layer. You’ll be inserting content into each of those keyframes. But 
first you’ll learn to work with sound.

Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
using Sounds
You can import several types of sound files into Flash. Flash supports MP3, WAV, 
and AIFF files, which are three common sound formats. When you import sound 
files into Flash, they are stored in your Library panel. You can then drag the sound 
files from the Library panel onto the Stage at different points along the Timeline to 
synchronize those sounds to whatever may be happening on the Stage.
importing sound files
You’ll import several sound files to the Library panel, which you’ll use throughout 
this lesson.
1 Choose File > Import > Import To Library. 
2 Select the Monkey.wav file in the Lesson08/08Start/Sounds folder, and click Open.
The Monkey.wav file appears in your Library panel. The sound file is indicated 
by a unique icon, and the preview window shows a waveform—a series of peaks 
and valleys that represent the sound.
3 Click the Play button on the far upper-right corner of the Library preview window. 
The sound plays.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 295
4 Double-click the sound icon in front of your Monkey.wav file.
The Sound Properties dialog box appears, providing information on your sound 
file, including its original location, size, and other technical properties.
5 Choose File > Import > Import To Library and select the other sound files to 
import into your Flash project. Import Elephant.wav, Lion.wav, Africanbeat.
mp3, and Afrolatinbeat.mp3.
Your Library panel should contain all the sound files.
6 Create a folder in your Library panel and place all the sound files in it to 
organize your Library panel. Name the folder sounds. 

296 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
Where to Find Sound Clips
If you’re looking for interesting sounds to 
use in your Flash movie, you can use the free 
sound files available from Adobe. Flash CS6 
Professional comes preloaded with dozens of 
useful sounds that you can access by choos-
ing Window > Common Libraries > Sounds. 
An external library (a library that is not con-
nected to the current project) appears.
Simply drag one of the sound files from the 
external library onto your Stage. The sound 
will appear in your own Library panel.
Placing sounds on the timeline
You can place a sound at any keyframe along the Timeline, and Flash will play that 
sound when the playhead reaches the keyframe. You’ll place a sound on the very 
first keyframe to play as the movie starts to provide a pleasant audio introduction 
and set the mood.
1 Select the videos layer on the Timeline. 
2 Insert a new layer and rename it sounds. 
3 Select the first keyframe of the sounds layer.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 297
4 Drag the Afrolatinbeat.mp3 file from the sounds folder in your Library panel 
onto the Stage.
The waveform of your sound appears on the Timeline.
5 Select the first keyframe of the sounds layer. 
In the Properties inspector, note that your sound file is now listed on the  
pull-down menu under the Sound section.
6 Select Stream for the Sync option. 
The Sync options determine how the sound plays on the Timeline. Use Stream 
sync for long passages of music or narration when you want to time the sound 
with the Timeline.

298 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
7 Move the playhead back and forth on the Timeline. 
The sound plays as you scrub the Timeline.
8 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. 
The sound plays only for a short while before getting cut off. Because the sound 
is set to Stream, it plays only when the playhead moves along the Timeline, and 
if there are sufficient frames to play. There is a stop action at frame 9 that stops 
the playhead, and hence, stops the sound. 
adding frames to the timeline
The next step is to extend the Timeline so that the entire sound (or at least the por-
tions that you desire) plays before the stop action halts the playhead.
1 Click on the Stage to deselect the Timeline, and then place the playhead 
between frames 1 and 9 by clicking on the top frame numbers. 
2 Choose Insert > Timeline > Frame, or press F5, to insert frames in all the layers 
between frames 1 and 9. 
3 Insert enough frames so that there are about 50 frames to play the sound before 
the stop action in the second keyframe of the actions layer.
4 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. 
The sound lasts longer because it has more frames to play before the 
playhead stops.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 299
Clipping the end of a sound
The sound clip you imported is a bit longer than you need. You’ll shorten the sound 
file by using the Edit Envelope dialog box. Then you’ll apply a fade so the sound 
gradually decreases as it ends.
1 Select the first keyframe of the sounds layer. 
2 In the Properties inspector, click the Pencil button. 
The Edit Envelope dialog box appears, showing you the sound’s waveform. 
The top and the bottom waveform are the left and right channels of the sound 
(stereo). A timeline is between the waveforms, a pull-down menu of preset 
effects at the left corner, and view options at the bottom.

3 In the Edit Envelope dialog box, click the Seconds icon, if it isn’t already selected. 

300 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
The timeline changes units to show seconds instead of frames. Click the Frames 
icon to switch back. You can switch back and forth, depending on how you 
want to view your sound.
4 Click the Zoom Out icon until you can see the entire waveform.
The waveform appears to end at around 240 frames, or about 10 seconds.
5 Drag the right end of the time slider inward to about frame 45. 
The sound shortens by being clipped from the end. The sound now plays for 
about 45 frames. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 301
6 Click OK to accept the changes you’ve made. 
The waveform on the main Timeline indicates the shortened sound. 
Changing the volume of a sound
The sound will be more elegant if it slowly fades out instead of being abruptly cut 
off. You can change the volume levels through time in the Edit Envelope dia-
log box. Use it to fade in, fade out, or modulate the volume of the left and right 
channels separately.
1 Select the first keyframe of the sounds layer. 
2 In the Properties inspector, click the Pencil button. 
The Edit Envelope dialog box appears.
3 Select the Frames viewing option, and zoom in on the waveform to see its end 
near frame 45. 

302 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
4 Click on the top horizontal line of the top waveform above frame 20. 
A box appears on the line, indicating a keyframe for the sound volume.
5 Click on the top horizontal line of the upper waveform above frame 45 and drag 
it down to the bottom of the window. 
The downward diagonal line indicates the drop in volume from 100% to 0%.
6 Click on the corresponding keyframe on the lower waveform and drag it down 
to the bottom of the window. 
The volume levels for both the left and right channels slowly decrease starting at 
frame 20. By frame 45, the volume level is at 0%. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 303
7 Test the effects of your sound edits by clicking the Play button on the lower-left 
side of the dialog box. Click OK to accept the changes.
deleting or changing the sound file
If you don’t want the sound on your Timeline, or you want to change to a different 
sound, you can make those changes in the Properties inspector. 
1 Select the first keyframe of the sounds layer. 
2 In the Properties inspector, select None in the Name pull-down menu. 
The sound is removed from the Timeline.
3 Now let’s add a different sound. Select Africanbeat.mp3 for Name. 
The Africanbeat.mp3 sound is added to the Timeline. The settings in the Edit 
Envelope dialog box that clip the sound and fade it out are reset. Return to the 
Edit Envelope dialog box to customize the Africanbeat.mp3 sound in the same 
way as the previous sound.
Setting the quality of the sounds
You can control how much or how little your sounds are compressed in the final 
SWF file. With less compression, your sounds will be better quality. However, your 
final SWF size will be much larger. With more compression, you’ll have poor-quality 
sounds but a smaller file size. You must determine the balance of quality and file size 
based on the minimum acceptable level of quality. Set the sound quality and com-
pression in the Publish Settings options.
P Note: You can 
choose and apply some 
of the preset effects 
from the pull-down 
menu in the Edit 
Envelope dialog box. 
Common effects like a 
fade-in or a fade-out 
are provided for your 
convenience.

304 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
1 Choose File > Publish Settings. 
The Publish Settings dialog box appears.
2 Click the Flash check box on the left to see the Audio stream and Audio 
event settings. 
3 Click the Audio Stream settings to open the Sound Settings dialog box. Change 
the Bit rate to 64 kbps and deselect the Convert stereo to mono check box. 
Click OK to accept the settings.
4 Click the Audio Event settings.
The Sound Settings dialog box appears.
5 Change the Bit rate to 64 kbps and deselect the Convert stereo to mono check 
box. Click OK to accept the settings.
Now both the Audio Stream and Audio Event settings should be at 64 kbps with 
stereo sounds preserved.
The Africanbeat.mp3 file in particular relies on stereo effects, so keeping both 
the left and right channels is important. 
The Bit rate is measured in kilobits per second, and it determines the quality of 
the sound in your final, exported Flash movie. The higher the bit rate the better 
the quality. However, the higher the bit rate the larger your file becomes. For 
this lesson, change the bit rate to 64 kbps. 
6 Select Override sound settings, and click OK to save the settings.
The sound settings in the Publish Settings will determine how all your sounds 
are exported.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 305
7 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. 
The stereo effect of the sound is preserved, and the quality is determined by 
your settings in the Publish Settings dialog box.
adding sounds to buttons
In the kiosk, the buttons appear on your stage on the left. You’ll add sounds to the 
buttons so that they play whenever the user clicks them.
1 In the Library panel, double-click the icon of the button symbol called 
sound_button1. 
You enter symbol-editing mode for that button symbol.
2 The three layers in the button symbol help organize the content for the Up, 
Over, Down, and Hit states.
3 Insert a new layer and rename it sounds. 
4 Select the Down frame in your sounds layer and insert a keyframe. 
A new keyframe appears in the Down state of your button.
5 Drag the Monkey.wav file from the sounds folder in your Library panel to 
the Stage.
A waveform for the Monkey.wav file appears in the Down keyframe of the 
sounds layer.

306 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
6 Select the Down keyframe in the sounds layer.
7 In the Properties inspector, choose Start for the Sync option. 
A Start sync option triggers the sound whenever the playhead enters that 
particular keyframe.
8 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. Test the first button to 
hear the monkey, and then close the preview window. 
9 Edit the sound_button2 and the sound_button3 to add the Lion.wav and the 
Elephant.wav sounds to their Down states. 
understanding Sound Sync options
Sound sync refers to the way the sound is triggered and played. There are several 
options: Event, Start, Stop, and Stream. Stream ties the sound to the Timeline so you 
can easily synchronize animated elements to the sound. Event and Start are used to 
trigger a sound (usually a short sound) to a specific event, like a button click. Event 
and Start are similar except that the Start sync does not trigger the sound if it is 
already playing (so there are no overlapping sounds possible with Start sync). The 
Stop option is used to stop a sound, although you’ll use it rarely, if ever. If you want 
to stop a sound with a Stream sync, simply insert a blank keyframe.
understanding Flash Video
Flash makes it very easy to deliver video over the Web. Combining video, interac-
tivity, and animation can create a very rich and immersive multimedia experience 
for your viewers.
There are two options to display video in Flash. The first option is to keep the video 
separate from your Flash file and use a playback component from Flash to play the 
video. The second option is to embed the video in your Flash file. 
Both methods require that the video be formatted correctly first. The appro-
priate video format for Flash is Flash Video, which uses the extension .flv or 
the extension .f4v. F4V supports the H.264 standard, a state-of-the-art video 
codec that delivers high quality with remarkably efficient compression. A codec 
P Note: You can 
also add sound to the 
Over state of a button 
symbol, and the sound 
will play whenever 
the mouse cursor just 
hovers over the button.
P Note: Flash can 
actually play back 
any video encoded in 
H.264, so your video 
file doesn’t have to 
have the .f4v extension. 
For example, a video 
with a .mov extension 
encoded by QuickTime 
Pro with H.264 is 
compatible with Flash.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 307
(compression-decompression) is a method computers use to compress a video file 
to save space, and then decompress it to play it back. FLV is the standard format for 
previous versions of Flash and uses the older codecs Sorenson Spark or On2 VP6.
using adobe Media encoder
You can convert your video files to the proper FLV or F4V format using Adobe 
Media Encoder CS6, a stand-alone application that comes with Flash Professional 
CS6. Adobe Media Encoder can convert single files or multiple files (known as 
batch processing) to make your workflow easier. 
adding a video file to adobe Media encoder
The first step to convert your video file to a compatible Flash format is to add the 
video to Adobe Media Encoder for encoding. 
1 Launch Adobe Media Encoder CS6, which comes installed with Adobe Flash 
Professional CS6. 
The opening screen displays the Queue in the upper left, which shows any 
current video files that have been added for processing. The Queue panel should 
be empty. The other panels are the Encoding panel, which shows any video 
currently being processed; the Watch Folders, which shows folders that have 
been identified for batch processing; and the Preset Browser, which provides 
common predefined settings.
Queue
Preset browser
Encoding panel
Watch folders

308 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
2 Choose File > Add Source or click the Plus button in the Queue panel.
A dialog box opens for you to select a video file.
3 Navigate to the Lesson08/08Start folder, select the Penguins.mov file, and 
click Open.
The Penguins.mov file is added to the Queue and is ready for conversion to FLV 
or F4V format. 
Converting video files to Flash Video
Converting your video files is easy, and the length of time it takes depends on how 
large your original video file is.
1 In the first column under Format, select the F4V format.
F4V is the latest video format for Flash. FLV is an older, but still valid format.
2 Under the Preset options, choose Web – 320x240, 4x3, Project Framerate, 
500kbps.
P Note: You can also 
drag the file directly to 
the Queue from your 
desktop.
P Note: In Adobe 
Media Encoder CS6, 
the default setting is 
not to start the Queue 
automatically when 
the program is idle. In 
CS5, the default setting 
was to start the Queue 
automatically. You can 
still change the setting 
by choosing Adobe 
Media Encoder CS6 > 
Preferences.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 309
You can choose one of many standard preset options from the menu. The 
options determine the dimensions of the video and the quality of the video. 
The Web – 320 x 240 option converts your original video to an average size 
to display video in a Web browser.
3 Click the Output File.
The Save As dialog box appears. You can choose to save the converted file in 
a different location on your computer and choose a different filename. Your 
original video will not be deleted or altered in any way. 
4 Click the Start queue button (triangular icon) in the upper-right corner.
Flash begins the encoding process. Flash displays the settings for the encoded 
video and shows the progress and a preview of the video in the Encoding panel.
When the encoding process finishes, a “Done” label and a green check appear in 
the Status column of the Queue panel. A sound indicates that the file has been 
converted successfully. 
You now have the file, Penguins.f4v in your Lesson08/08Start folder along with 
the original Penguins.mov file.
P Note: You can 
change the status of 
individual files in the 
Queue by selecting the 
file in the display list 
and choosing Edit > 
Reset Status or Edit > 
Skip Selection. Reset 
Status removes the 
green check from a 
completed file so it 
can be encoded again, 
whereas Skip Selection 
makes Flash skip that 
particular file.

310 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
using Watch Folders and the 
Preset Browser Settings
The Watch Folders panel can be helpful in processing multiple videos, while the 
Preset Browser stores predefined settings for specific target devices.
Adding a folder to the Watch Folders panel adds 
all of its contents to the queue, where they are 
automatically encoded. You can also add a dif-
ferent Output setting to the same folder, which 
will result in multiple formats for the same set 
of videos. To add a new Output setting, click 
the Add Output button at the top of the Watch 
Folders panel.
A duplicate selection appears in the list. Choose a new format and/or new preset 
options. If you want to apply a particular setting from the Preset Browser, choose the 
setting and simply drag and drop it on top of your selection in the Watch Folders panel.
This is useful when you need different video formats for high-bandwidth and low-
bandwidth viewers, or for different devices such as tablets and mobile phones.
understanding encoding options
You can customize many settings when converting your original video. You can crop 
and resize your video to specific dimensions, just convert a snippet of the video, 
adjust the type of compression and the compression levels, and even apply filters to 
the video. To display the encoding options, choose Edit > Reset Status to reset the 
Penguins.mov file, and then click the Format or the Preset selection in the display list 
or choose Edit > Export Settings. The Export Settings dialog box appears.

Cropping your video
If you only want to show a portion of your video, you can crop it. If you haven’t 
done so already, choose Edit > Reset Status to reset the Penguins.mov file, and then 
choose Edit > Export Settings so you can experiment with the cropping settings.
1 Select the Source tab in the upper-left corner of the Export Settings dialog box, 
and then click the Crop button. 
The cropping box appears over the video preview window.
2 Drag the sides inward to crop from the top, bottom, left, or right. 

312 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
The grayed-out portions outside the box will be discarded. Flash displays the 
new dimensions next to your cursor. You can also use the Left, Top, Right, and 
Bottom settings above the preview window to enter exact pixel values.
3 If you want to keep the crop in a standard proportion, click the Crop 
Proportions menu and choose a desired ratio. 
The cropping box will be constrained to the selected proportions.
4 To see the effects of the crop, click the Output tab in the upper-left corner of the 
preview window. 
The preview window shows how your final video will appear.
5 The Source Scaling pull-down menu contains options for setting how the crop 
will appear in the final output file:
If the video has the selected crop shown here, then the Crop Setting options will 
affect outputted file as follows:

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 313
• Scale To Fit adjusts the dimensions of the crop and adds black borders to fit 
the output file. 
• Scale To Fill adjusts the dimensions of the crop to fill the size of the 
output file. 
• Stretch To Fill adjusts the dimensions of the crop by distorting the image, 
if necessary, to fill the size of the output file. 
• Scale To Fit With Black Borders adds black bands on any of the sides to fit 
the crop in the dimensions of the output file.
• Change Output Size to Match Source changes the dimensions of the 
output file to match the crop dimensions. 

314 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
6 Exit the cropping mode without making the crop by clicking the Crop button 
again under the Source tab to deselect it. You will not need to crop the 
Penguins.mov video for this lesson.
adjusting video length
Your video may have unwanted segments at the beginning or the end. You can 
shave off footage from either end to adjust the overall length of your video.
1 Click and drag the playhead (top yellow marker) to scrub through your video 
to preview the footage. Place the playhead at the desired beginning point of 
your video.
Time markers indicate the number of seconds that have elapsed.
2 Click the Set In Point icon. 
The In point moves to the current position of the playhead.
3 Drag the playhead to the desired ending point of your video.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 315
4 Click the Set Out Point icon. 
The Out point moves to the current position of the playhead.
5 You can also simply drag the In and Out point markers to bracket the desired 
video segment. 
The highlighted portion of your video between the In and Out point markers 
will be the only segment of your original video that will be encoded.
6 Drag the In and Out points back to their original positions, or choose Entire 
Clip from the Source Range pull-down menu, because you do not need to adjust 
the video length for this lesson.
Cue Points
At the bottom left of the 
Export Settings dialog box 
is an area where you can set 
cue points for your video.
Cue points are special mark-
ers at various points along 
the video. With ActionScript, 
you can program Flash to 
recognize when those cue 
points are encountered, or 
you can navigate to specific 
cue points. Cue points can transform an ordinary, linear video into a true interactive, 
immersive video experience. Later in this lesson, you’ll add cue points to your video 
within Flash when your video is directly on the Stage.
Setting advanced video and audio options
The right side of the Export Settings dialog box contains information about the 
original video and summarizes the export settings. 
P Note: You can use 
the left or the right 
arrow keys on your 
keyboard to move 
back or ahead frame by 
frame for finer control.

316 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
You can choose one of the preset options from the top Preset menu. At the bottom, 
you can navigate to advanced video and audio encoding options using the tabs. At

6 Click Start Queue to begin the encoding process with your custom resize settings. 
Flash creates another F4V file of Penguins.mov. Delete the first one you created 
and rename the second one Penguins.f4v.
Saving advanced video and audio options
If you want to process many videos similarly, it makes sense to save your advanced 
video and audio options. You can do that in Adobe Media Encoder. Once saved, 
you can easily apply your settings to other videos in the queue.
1 Choose Edit > Reset Status to reset the status of your penguin video in the 
queue, then choose Edit > Export Settings. 
2 In the Export Settings dialog box, click the Save Preset button. 
3 In the dialog box that opens, provide a descriptive name for the video and audio 
options. Click OK.
4 Return to the queue of videos. You can apply your custom settings to additional 
videos by simply choosing the preset from the Preset pull-down menu.

Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
Playback of external Video
Now that you have successfully converted your video to the correct Flash-compatible 
format, you can use it in your Flash zoo kiosk project. You will have Flash play each 
of the animal videos at the different labeled keyframes on the Timeline.
You will keep your videos external to the Flash project. By keeping videos exter-
nal, your Flash project remains small, the videos can be edited separately, and the 
videos can maintain different frame rates from your Flash project.
1 Open your 08_workingcopy.fla project in Flash Professional CS6. 
2 Select the keyframe labeled penguins in the videos layer.
3 Choose File > Import > Import Video.
The Import Video wizard appears. The Import Video wizard guides you step by 
step through the process of adding video to Flash.
4 In the Import Video wizard, select On Your Computer and click Browse.
5 In the dialog box, select Penguins.f4v from the Lesson08/08Start folder and 
click Open.

The path to the video file appears. 
6 Select the Load external video with playback component option. Click Next 
or Continue.
7 In the next screen of the Import Video wizard, you select the skin, or the 
interface controls for the video. From the Skin menu, select the third option 
from the top, MinimaFlatCustomColorPlayBackSeekCounterVolMute.swf, if it’s 
not already selected.
The skins fall in three broad categories. The skins that begin with “Minima” are 
the latest designs and include options with a numeric counter. The skins that 
begin with “SkinUnder” are controls that appear below the video. The skins 
that begin with “SkinOver” are controls that overlap the bottom edge of the 
video. A preview of the skin and its controls appear in the preview window.
8 Select color #333333 with a 75% Alpha. Click Next or Continue.
P Note: The skin 
is a small SWF file 
that determines the 
functionality and 
appearance of the 
video’s controls. You 
can use one of the skins 
provided with Flash, 
or you can choose 
None from the top of 
the menu.

320 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
9 On the next screen of the Import Video wizard, review the information for the 
video file, and then click Finish to place the video.
10 Your video with the selected skin appears on the Stage. Place the video on the 
left side of the Stage.
An FLVPlayback component also appears in your Library panel. The component 
is a special widget that is used on the Stage to play your external video.
P Note: When a video 
on the Stage is selected, 
you can press the 
spacebar to begin or 
pause playback.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 321
11 Click the play button on the skin of your video to preview the video.
The video plays on your Stage. Use the controls to play, stop, scrub, and change 
the volume of the movie. 
12 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. After the musical 
introduction, click the Magellanic Penguins button.
The FLVPlayback component plays the external penguin video with the skin you 
chose in the Import Video wizard. Close the preview window. 
13 The other animal videos have already been encoded (in FLV format) and 
provided in the 08Start folder. Import the Mandrill.flv, Tiger.flv, and Lion.flv 
videos in each of their corresponding keyframes. Choose the same skin as the 
Penguin.f4v video.
Controlling the video playback
The FLVPlayback component lets you control which video plays, whether the video 
plays automatically, and other aspects of playback. The options for playback can 
be accessed in the Properties inspector. Individual properties are listed in the left 
column, and their corresponding values are listed in the right column. Select one 
of the videos on the Stage, and then choose among the following options:
• To change the autoPlay option, deselect the check box. When the check box is 
selected, the video plays automatically. When the check box is deselected, the 
video is paused on the first frame.
P Note: If you don’t 
have a skin on your 
video, you can still 
control playback of 
the video on the Stage 
by right-clicking/Ctrl-
clicking on the video 
and choosing Play, 
Pause, or Rewind.
P Note: The FLV  
or F4V files, the  
08_workingcopy.swf 
file, and the skin file are 
all required for your zoo 
kiosk project to work. 
The skin file is published 
in the same folder as 
your FLA file.

a new skin in the dialog box that appears.
• To change the transparency of the skin, enter a decimal value from 0 (totally 
transparent) to 1 (totally opaque) for the skinBackgroundAlpha.
• To change the color of the skin, click on the color chip and choose a new color 
for the skinBackgroundColor.
• To change the video file or the location of the video file that Flash seeks to play, 
click the source option. 
In the Content Path dialog box that appears, enter a new filename or click the 
Folder icon to choose a new file to play. The path is relative to the location of 
your Flash file.
Working with Video and transparency
For the various animal videos, you want to show the entire frame with the animals 
in the foreground and the lush environment in the background. But sometimes you 
want to use a video file that doesn’t include a background. For this project, the zoo 
director was filmed in front of a green screen, which was removed using Adobe 
After Effects. When you use the video in Flash, the zoo director appears to be in 
front of the Flash background. A similar effect is used for news weatherpersons, 
where the background of the video is totally transparent and can show weather 
graphics behind the person.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 323
Transparencies in video (called alpha channels) are supported only in the FLV for-
mat using the On2 VP6 codec. When encoding a video with an alpha channel from 
Adobe Media Encoder, be sure to choose Edit > Export Settings, click the Video 
tab, and then select the Encode Alpha Channel option.
You’ll import the video file, which is already in FLV format, into Flash for display 
with the playback component. 
importing the video clip
Now you’ll use the Import Video wizard to import the Popup.flv file, which has 
already been encoded with an alpha channel.
1 Insert a new layer called popupvideo.
2  Insert a keyframe at frame 50 and insert another keyframe at frame 86.
You’ll place the video of the zoo director at the end of the musical introduction 
at the same time the stop action appears (frame 50). The keyframe at frame 86 
ensures that the video of the zoo director disappears from the Stage when the 
animal videos appear.
3  Select the keyframe at frame 50.
4  Choose File > Import > Import Video. 
5  In the Import Video wizard, select On Your Computer and click Browse. Select 
the Popup.flv file in the Lesson08/08Start folder and click Open. 
6 Select Load external video with playback component. Click Next or Continue. 
7 Select the same skin that you’ve been using from the Skin menu and click Next 
or Continue.

Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
8 Click Finish to place the video. 
The video of the zoo director with a transparent background appears on the Stage.
9 Preview the video on the Stage by clicking the play button on the skin. 
10 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. 
After the musical introduction, the zoo director appears. If you click on one of 
the animal video buttons, the popup video is removed from the Timeline.
P Note: If you don’t 
stop one video before 
navigating to another 
keyframe containing a 
second video, the audio 
can overlap. To prevent 
overlapping sounds, 
use the command 
SoundMixer.
stopAll() to stop 
all sounds before 
starting a new video. 
The ActionScript in the 
first keyframe of the 
actions layer in your 
08_workingcopy.fla file 
contains the correct 
code to stop all sounds 
before navigating to a 
new animal video.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 325
using a green Screen
Professionals often film people in front of solid green or blue backgrounds so they 
can easily remove, or key, the background in a video editing application such as 
Adobe After Effects. Then the person is merged with a different background. The 
image of the zoo director was filmed in front of a green screen, which was removed 
in After Effects. Follow these steps to use a green screen:
1 
Shoot footage in front of a green 
screen:
•
Use a green background that is 
flat, smooth, and free of shadows 
so the color is as pure as possible.
•
Minimize the light that reflects off 
the green screen onto the subject.
•
Keep movement to a minimum for 
Flash Video; use a tripod if possible.
2  Remove the background in After 
Effects or other video editing 
application:
•
In After Effects, import the 
file as footage, create a new 
composition, and drag it onto 
the Composition Timeline.
•
Create a garbage mask to 
roughly outline the shape and 
remove most of the background. 
But be sure the subject never 
moves outside the mask!
•
Use the Color Range keying 
effect to delete the rest of the 
background. You may need to do 
some fine-tuning with the Matte 
Choker and Spill Suppressor 
effects. A spill suppressor 
removes the light that splashes 
onto the edges of the subject.
3 
Export the file to FLV format:
Export the video file to Flash Video 
(FLV) format directly from the video 
editing application. Be sure to select 
Encode Alpha Channel. The alpha 
channel is the selection around the subject. Encoding the alpha channel ensures 
that the video exports without a background. 

326 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
using Cue Points
Cue points are special markers that you place in your video that Flash can detect 
with ActionScript. There are two ways to use cue points. Cue points can trigger 
an ActionScript command, letting you synchronize the video with other Flash ele-
ments. Or, you can jump to particular cue points in the video with ActionScript. 
Both types of cue points add more functionality to video.
In this section, you’ll add cue points to the zoo director video so relevant informa-
tion can be displayed on the Stage as he speaks. 
inserting cue points
There are four points in the zoo director video at which you’ll want to synchronize 
the display of additional information. First, when he introduces himself, you’ll show 
his name. Second, when he instructs the audience to click on a video, you’ll high-
light the videos. Third, when he refers to the sounds, you’ll highlight the sounds. 
Fourth, you’ll add a cue point to mark the end of the video.
1 Select frame 50 (the first keyframe in which the zoo director video appears) of 
the popupvideo layer.
2  Select the video of the zoo director on the Stage.
3  Click the play button on the skin and 
pause the video when the zoo director 
says, “…my name is Paul Smith.”
The numeric counter that displays 
the elapsed time should read about 
two seconds.
P Note: Recall that 
you can add cue points 
to video with Adobe 
Media Encoder. You can 
also add cue points to 
video with ActionScript 
in the Actions panel, 
which is not discussed 
in this book.
P Note: If the 
FLVPlayback 
component on the 
Stage doesn’t show a 
preview of the video, 
right-click/Ctrl-click on 
the video and make 
sure that the Preview 
option is selected.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 327
4  In the Properties inspector, click the Plus button in the Cue Points section to 
add a cue point at the two-second mark. 
A cue point appears in the Cue Points section of the Properties inspector.
5 Click the name of the cue point in the Properties inspector and rename it 
namecue. 
6  Continue playing the video and pause it when the zoo director says, “…so click 
on a video.”
The numeric counter that displays the elapsed time should read about 12 seconds.
7 In the Properties inspector, click the Plus button in the Cue Points section to 
add a cue point at the 12-second mark, and rename the cue point videocue.

328 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
8 Continue playing the video and pause it when the zoo director says, “… click on 
a sound.” 
9 In the Properties inspector, add a third cue point and rename it soundcue. 
The third cue point should be at the 14-second mark. 
10 Continue playing the video until it reaches the end. In the Properties inspector, 
add a fourth cue point and rename it endcue. 
detecting and responding to cue points
Now you’ll add the ActionScript to detect the cue points and respond to them. 
The Code Snippets panel can help do much of the ActionScript coding. 
1 Open the Code Snippets panel (Window > Code Snippets).
2  Expand the Audio and Video folder in the Code Snippets panel and select the 
On Cue Point Event option.
The On Cue Point Event code snippet triggers a function whenever a cue point 
is detected.
P Note: If you need to 
adjust the time of any of 
the cue points, you can 
click and drag over the 
time or click to enter a 
time with millisecond 
precision.
P Note: In the 
Properties inspector, 
double-click any cue 
point in the Type 
column and your 
video on the Stage 
will immediately jump 
to that particular 
cue point.
P Note: To delete 
a cue point, select 
it in the Properties 
inspector and click the 
Minus sign.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 329
3  Select the Show Code button.
4  Click on the instance_name_here code and drag your pick whip over the video 
of the zoo director on the Stage.
5  Since you have not yet named the instance of your video component on 
the Stage, Flash asks you to provide a name. Enter paulsmithvideo as the 
instance name and click OK. Remember, objects must be named in order for 
ActionScript to control them.
6  Click Insert.
Flash automatically adds the necessary code to detect cue points on your 
selected video. A temporary flag on the Timeline indicates where the new 
ActionScript code is inserted. 

330 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
7  Select the keyframe in the actions layer at frame 50 and open the Actions panel 
to examine the newly inserted code.
The stop() command on the first line was already present in the file before you 
added the code snippet.
8  Now you must add conditional statements to check which of the cue points has 
been encountered and respond appropriately. Replace all the lines inside the 
function with the following code:
if (event.info.name=="namecue") {
  gotoAndStop("zoodirector");
}
if (event.info.name=="videocue") {
  gotoAndStop("videos");
}
if (event.info.name=="soundcue") {
  gotoAndStop("sounds");
}
if (event.info.name=="endcue") {
  gotoAndStop("home");
}

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 331
The final code checks the name of each cue point as it’s detected, and if there is 
a match, the playhead goes to a specific named keyframe on the Timeline.
adding the synchronized Flash elements
The Timeline already contains several named keyframes. In these keyframes, you’ll 
place additional Flash elements that appear as the cue points in the video are detected.
1 Select the keyframe named zoodirector in the hilights layer.

332 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
2 Drag the symbol called zoo directorname from the Library panel to the Stage 
and place it close to the video.
The graphic of the name appears when the playhead moves to the zoodirector 
keyframe.
3  Select the keyframe named videos in the hilights layer.
4 Select the Rectangle tool with a red 3.0 stroke and no fill. Draw a rectangle 
around the video buttons to highlight them.
The rectangular red outline appears when the playhead moves to the videos 
keyframe.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 333
5  Select the keyframe named sounds in the hilights layer.
6 Draw another rectangle with the same stroke and fill settings around the sound 
buttons to highlight them.
The rectangular red outline appears when the playhead moves to the 
sounds keyframe.
7 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
As the zoo director speaks, various Flash graphic elements pop up in synchrony.

334 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
Finishing touches
At the end of the zoo director’s introduction, he disappears, but the FLVPlayback 
component skin remains. You’ll remove the skin and position the video to be better 
integrated with the background.
1 Select the zoo director video in the popupvideo layer.
2 In the Component Parameters section of the Properties inspector, click the 
Pencil button next to the skin property.
3 In the dialog box that appears, choose None from the Skin pull-down menu. 
Click OK.
The zoo director video no longer has a skin.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 335
4 With the Selection tool, move the video so that its bottom edge aligns with the 
top edge of the navigation bar. You’ll also want to move the zoo director name 
that appears in the zoodirector keyframe of the hilights layer so it remains close 
to the video.
Without the skin, the illusion of the virtual zoo director greeting us is more 
convincing.
embedding Flash Video
In the previous section, you added cue points to synchronize external video with 
Flash elements on the Stage. Another way to integrate video with Flash elements 
is to use embedded video. Embedded video requires the FLV format and is best 
only for very short clips. The FLV file is saved in the Library panel of your Flash file, 
where you can place it on the Timeline. The video plays as long as there are suf-
ficient frames on your Timeline.
Embedding video in Flash is supported by Flash Player versions 6 and later. Keep 
in mind the following limitations of embedded video: Flash cannot maintain audio 
synchronization in embedded video that runs over 120 seconds. The maximum 
length of embedded movies is 16,000 frames. Another drawback of embedding 
your video is the increase in the size of your Flash project, which makes testing 
the movie (Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional) a longer process and the 
authoring sessions more tedious.
Because the embedded FLV plays within your Flash project, it is critically impor-
tant that your FLV have the same frame rate as your Flash file. If not, your embed-
ded video will not play at its intended speed. To make sure your FLV has the same 
frame rate as your FLA, be sure to set the correct frame rate in the Video tab of 
Adobe Media Encoder.

336 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
encoding the FLV for embedding
You’ll embed a short video of a polar bear in the beginning of your zoo kiosk project.
1 Open the Adobe Media Encoder.
2 Choose File > Add Source or click the Plus button in the Queue panel and 
choose the polarbear.mov file in the Lesson08/08Start folder.
The polarbear.mov file is added to the Queue.
3 In the options under Format, select the FLV format. 
4 Click the Preset settings or choose Edit > Export Settings to open the Edit 
Export options. 
5 Click the Video tab and set Frame Rate to 24. Make sure that the Resize Video 
check box is deselected.
The Flash file 08_workingcopy.fla is set at 24 frames per second, so you want 
your FLV to also be at 24 frames per second.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 337
6 Deselect Export Audio at the top of the dialog box. Click OK. 
7 Click the Start Queue button (triangular icon) in the upper-right corner to 
encode your video. 
The polarbear.flv file is created.
embedding an FLV on the timeline
Now that you have an FLV, you can import it into Flash and embed it on the 
Timeline.
1 Open the file 08_workingcopy.fla.
2 Select the first frame of the popupvideo layer.
3 Choose File > Import > Import Video. In the Import Video wizard, select 
On Your Computer and click Browse. Select the polarbear.flv file in the 
Lesson08/08Start folder and click Open.
4 In the Import Video wizard, select Embed FLV in SWF and play in timeline. 
Click Next or Continue.
5 Deselect Expand timeline if needed and deselect Include audio. Click Next 
or Continue.

338 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
6 Click Finish to import the video. 
The video of the polar bear appears on the Stage. Use the Selection tool to move 
it to the left side of the Stage.
The FLV also appears in your Library panel.
7 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to see the embedded video 
file play from frame 1 to frame 49.
P Note: You will 
not be able to hear 
audio in the authoring 
environment for 
embedded videos 
containing sound. To 
hear the audio, you 
must choose Control > 
Test Movie > in Flash 
Professional. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 339
using embedded video
It’s useful to think of embedded video as a multiframe symbol, very much like a 
symbol with a nested animation. You can convert an embedded video to a movie 
clip symbol, and then motion tween it to create interesting effects.
Next, you’ll apply a motion tween to the embedded video so it elegantly fades out 
just before the zoo director pops up and speaks.
1 Select the embedded video of the polar bear on the Stage, right-click/Ctrl-click 
it, and select Create Motion Tween.
2 Flash asks to convert the embedded video to a symbol so it can apply a motion 
tween. Click OK.
3 Flash asks to add enough frames inside the movie clip symbol so that the entire 
video can play. Click OK.
A motion tween is created on the layer.
4 Select the motion tween and click the Motion Editor tab.

340 
Lesson 8 Working with sound and Video
5 Collapse all the property categories. Click the Plus button next to Color Effect 
and choose Alpha.
The Alpha property is added to the motion tween.
6 Select frame 1, and set the Alpha amount to 100%. 
7 Select frame 30, right-click/Ctrl-click, and choose Add Keyframe. 
An Alpha keyframe appears at frame 30.
8 Select frame 49, right-click/Ctrl-click, and choose Add Keyframe. 
An Alpha keyframe appears at frame 49.
9 Select the last keyframe at frame 49 and drag it down to 0%. 
The Alpha is set to 0% at the last keyframe so the embedded video fades out 
from frame 30 to frame 49.
10 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to see the embedded video 
play and fade out.

What are the limitations for embedded video clips?
review answers
1 To edit the length of a sound clip, select the keyframe that contains it and click the 
Pencil button in the Properties inspector. Then move the time slider in the Edit 
Envelope dialog box to clip the sound from the front or from the end.
2 The skin is the combination of functionality and appearance of video controls, such 
as Play, Fast Forward, and Pause buttons. You can choose from a wide array of 
combinations with the buttons in different positions, and you can customize the skin 
with a different color or level of transparency. If you don’t want viewers to be able to 
control the video, apply None from the Skin menu.
3 Cue points are special markers that you can add to an external video with Adobe 
Media Encoder or in the Cue Points section of the Properties inspector. You can 
create event listeners in ActionScript that detect when a cue point is encountered 
and respond accordingly, for example, by displaying graphics that are synchronized 
with the video.
4 When you embed a video clip, it becomes part of the Flash document and is included 
in the Timeline. Because embedded video clips significantly increase the size of the 
document and produce audio synchronization issues, it’s best to embed video only if 
it is very brief and contains no audio track.

Use ActionScript to load external Flash content. 
By keeping Flash content modular, your projects 
remain more manageable and easier to edit. 

344 
Lesson 9 
Loading and Controlling Flash Content
getting started
You’ll start the lesson by viewing the finished movie. 
1 Double-click the 09End.html file in the Lesson09/09End folder to view the 
final movie. 
The project is a fictional online lifestyle magazine called Check. A jazzy animation 
appears on the front page showing four main sections of the magazine. Each 
section on the front page is a movie clip with a nested animation.
The first section is an article on the star of the upcoming movie Double Identity
(whose Web site you created in Lesson 4, “Adding Animation”), the second 
section describes a new car, the third section presents some facts and figures, 
and the fourth section is a self-improvement article. 
You can click on each section on the front page to access the content. The inside 
content is not complete, but you can imagine that each section could contain 
more information. Click again to return to the front page.
2 Double-click the page1.swf, page2.swf, page3.swf, and page4.swf files in the 
Lesson09/09End folder.
Each of the four sections is a separate Flash file. Note that the front page, 09End.
swf, loads each SWF file as needed.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 345
3 Close all the SWF files and open the 09Start.fla file in the Lesson09/09Start folder.
Many of the images, graphic elements, and animations have already been 
completed in this file. You will add the necessary ActionScript to make the Flash 
file load the external Flash content.
4 Choose File > Save As. Name the file 09_workingcopy.fla and save it in the 
09Start folder. Saving a working copy ensures that the original start file will be 
available if you want to start over. 
P Note: Flash warns 
you if your computer 
doesn’t have the same 
fonts contained in a FLA 
file. Choose substitute 
fonts, or simply click Use 
Default to have Flash 
automatically make the 
substitutions.

346 
Lesson 9 
Loading and Controlling Flash Content
Loading external Content
You’ll use ActionScript to load each of the external SWFs into your main Flash 
movie. Loading external content keeps your overall project in separate modules 
and prevents the project from becoming too bloated and difficult to download. It 
also makes it easier for you to edit, because you can edit individual sections instead 
of one, large, unwieldy file.
For example, if you wanted to change the article on the new car in the second 
section, you would simply open and edit the Flash file page2.fla, which contains 
that content.
To load the external files, you’ll use two ActionScript objects: one called a 
ProLoader and another called a URLRequest. 
1 Insert a new layer at the top and rename it actionscript.
2 Press F9 (Windows) or Option+F9 (Mac) to open the Actions panel.
3 Type the following two lines exactly as they appear here:
import fl.display.ProLoader;
var myProLoader:ProLoader=new ProLoader();
This code first imports the necessary code for the ProLoader class, and then 
creates a ProLoader object and names it myProLoader.
4 On the next line, type the following lines exactly as they appear here: 
page1_mc.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, page1content);
function page1content(e:MouseEvent):void {
 var myURL:URLRequest=new URLRequest("page1.swf");
 myProLoader.load(myURL);
 addChild(myProLoader);
}
P Note: The ProLoader 
object is an ActionScript 
object introduced 
in Flash Professional 
CS5.5. Older versions of 
Flash relied on a similar 
object called the Loader 
object. The ProLoader 
and the Loader objects 
are identical except 
that the ProLoader 
handles the loading of 
TLF text better for more 
reliable and consistent 
performance.
P Note: To compare 
punctuation, spacing, 
spelling, or any 
other aspects of the 
ActionScript, view the 
Actions panel in the 
09End.fla file.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 347
You’ve seen this syntax before in Lesson 6. On line 3, you create a listener that 
detects a mouse click on the object called page1_mc. This is a movie clip on the 
Stage. In response, Flash executes the function called page1content. 
The function called page1content does several things: First, it creates a 
URLRequest object referencing the name of the file you want to load. Second, 
it loads the URLRequest object into the ProLoader object. Third, it adds the 
ProLoader object to the Stage so you can see it.
5 Select the movie clip on the left side of the Stage with the movie star. 
6 In the Properties inspector, name it page1_mc. 
The ActionScript you entered refers to the object called page1_mc, so you need 
to apply the name to one of the movie clips on the Stage.

348 
Lesson 9 
Loading and Controlling Flash Content
7 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to see your movie so far. 
The front page plays its animation and stops. When you click on the movie star, 
the file called page1.swf loads and is displayed.
8 Close the SWF called 09_workingcopy.swf. 
9 Select the first frame of the actionscript layer and open the Actions panel. 
10 Copy and paste the event listener and the function so you have four distinct 
listeners for each of the four movie clips on the Stage. The four listeners should 
appear as follows:
page1_mc.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, page1content);
function page1content(e:MouseEvent):void {
 var myURL:URLRequest=new URLRequest("page1.swf");
 myProLoader.load(myURL);
 addChild(myProLoader);
}
page2_mc.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, page2content);
function page2content(e:MouseEvent):void {
 var myURL:URLRequest=new URLRequest("page2.swf");
 myProLoader.load(myURL);
 addChild(myProLoader);
}
P Note: You can also 
use the ProLoader and 
URLRequest objects to 
dynamically load image 
files. The syntax is 
identical. Simply replace 
the SWF filename 
with a JPEG filename, 
and Flash loads the 
specified image.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 349
page3_mc.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, page3content);
function page3content(e:MouseEvent):void {
 var myURL:URLRequest=new URLRequest("page3.swf");
 myProLoader.load(myURL);
 addChild(myProLoader);
}
page4_mc.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, page4content);
function page4content(e:MouseEvent):void {
 var myURL:URLRequest=new URLRequest("page4.swf");
 myProLoader.load(myURL);
 addChild(myProLoader);
}
11 Click on each of the remaining three movie clips on the Stage and name them 
in the Properties inspector. Name the yellow car page2_mc, name the data 
section page3_mc, and name the self-improvement section on the lower left 
page4_mc. 
P Note: Adding event 
listeners to movie clips 
can make them respond 
to mouse clicks, but 
your cursor doesn’t 
automatically change to 
a hand icon to indicate 
that it is clickable. In the 
Actions panel, set the 
property buttonMode
to true for each movie 
clip instance to enable 
the hand cursor. For 
example, page1_
mc.buttonMode=true
makes the hand cursor 
appear when you move 
your mouse over that 
movie clip on the Stage.

Lesson 9 
Loading and Controlling Flash Content
Using the Code snippets Panel
You can also use the Code Snippets panel to visually point and add code to load 
external SWF or image files. Using the Code Snippets panel can save you time and 
effort, but writing your own code by hand is the only way to understand how the 
code works and will help you begin building your own more sophisticated, custom-
ized projects.
Follow these alternate steps if you wish to rely on the Code Snippets panel. However, 
the remainder of this lesson will refer to the code presented in the previous section.
1 Choose Window > Code Snippets, or if your Actions panel is already open, click 
the Code Snippets button at the top right of the Actions panel. 
The Code Snippets panel appears. The code snippets are organized in folders 
that describe their function.
2 In the Code Snippets panel, expand the folder called Load and Unload and 
select Click to Load/Unload SWF or Image.
3 Click the Show code button. 
The actual code appears. There is a commented portion of the code that 
describes the function of the code and the different parameters. The colored 
parts of the code are the parts that you need to change.
4 Move your mouse over the blue words instance_name_here.
Your mouse cursor turns into the pick whip icon that appears as a small curl.
5 Click and drag your cursor from the blue code words to the first movie clip on 
the Stage.
The movie clip instance becomes highlighted with a yellow border, indicating 
that the selected code snippet will be applied to it.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 351
6 Release your mouse cursor.
A dialog box appears to allow you to give a name to the instance. Name the 
instance page1_mc.
7 Replace the blue URL with the filename page1.swf.
The filename page1.swf refers to the external SWF file that will be loaded.

appears on the Timeline to let you know that the code has been added, and to 
indicate where on the Timeline it’s been placed. 
9 Click on the flag to open the Actions panel to view the code.
Examine the code. The code is a little more complex than the code presented in 
the previous section. The code includes a toggling functionality, so the user can 
click once to load the SWF and then click again to unload the SWF. However, 
because the external SWF that loads covers the entire Stage, the original movie 
clip is hidden and inaccessible to click on. Use this code snippet if your layout 
allows the button or movie clip that triggers the loading function to remain 
visible on the Stage.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 353
Positioning of the Loaded Content
Loaded content is aligned with the Stage (or whatever it is loaded into). The registra-
tion point of the ProLoader object is at its top-left corner, so the top-left corner of the 
external SWFs align with the top-left corner of the Stage (where x=0 and y=0). Since 
the four external Flash files (page1.swf, page2.swf, page3.swf, and page4.swf) all have 
the same Stage size as the Flash file that loads them, the Stage is completely covered.
However, you can position the ProLoader object wherever you want. If you want to 
place the ProLoader object in a different horizontal position, you can set a new X 
value for the ProLoader object with ActionScript. If you want to place the ProLoader 
in a different vertical position, you can set a new Y value for the ProLoader. Here’s 
how: In the Actions panel, enter the name of the ProLoader object, followed by a 
period, the property x or y, and then the equals symbol and a new value.
In the following example, the ProLoader object called myProLoader is repositioned 
200 pixels from the left edge and 100 pixels from the top edge.
When the external SWF content loads, it shows up exactly 200 pixels to the right 
and 100 pixels down.

354 
Lesson 9 
Loading and Controlling Flash Content
removing external Content
Once an external SWF file is loaded, how do you unload it to return to the main 
Flash movie? One way is to unload the SWF content from the ProLoader object, so 
the audience can no longer see it. You will use the command unload() to do this. 
1 Select the first frame of the actionscript layer and open the Actions panel.
2 Add the following lines to your code in the Script pane:
myProLoader.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, unloadcontent);
function unloadcontent(e:MouseEvent):void {
 myProloader.unload();
}
This code adds an event listener to the ProLoader object called myProLoader. 
When you click on the ProLoader object, the function called unloadcontent is 
executed.
The function performs just one action: It removes any loaded content from the 
ProLoader object.
3 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to preview the movie. 
Click on any of the four sections, and then click on the loaded content to return 
to the main movie.
P Note: If you want to 
remove the ProLoader 
object from the Stage 
entirely, you can use 
the removeChild().
command. The code 
removeChild 
(myProLoader)
removes the ProLoader 
object called 
myProLoader so that it 
is no longer displayed 
on the Stage.
P Note: If your loaded 
content contains 
open streams (such 
as video or sounds), 
those sounds may 
continue even after 
you’ve unloaded 
the SWF from the 
ProLoader object. Use 
the unloadAndStop() 
command to extinguish 
the sounds as well 
as unload the SWF 
content. 

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 355
Controlling Movie Clips
When you return to the front page, you’ll see the four sections, so you can click 
another movie clip to load a different section. But wouldn’t it be nice to replay the 
initial animation? The initial animations are nested inside each movie clip, and you 
can control the four movie clips that are on the Stage. You can use the basic naviga-
tion commands that you already learned in Lesson 6 (gotoAndStop, gotoAnd-
Play, stop, play) to navigate the Timelines of these movie clips. Simply precede 
the command with the name of the movie clip and separate them with a dot. Flash 
targets that particular movie clip and moves its Timeline accordingly.
1 Select the first frame of the actionscript layer and open the Actions panel.
2 Add to the commands in the function called unloadcontent so the entire 
function appears as follows:
function unloadcontent(e:MouseEvent):void {
 myProloader.unload();
 page1_mc.gotoAndPlay(1);
 page2_mc.gotoAndPlay(1);
 page3_mc.gotoAndPlay(1);
 page4_mc.gotoAndPlay(1);
}

356 
Lesson 9 
Loading and Controlling Flash Content
In this function, which is executed when the user clicks the ProLoader object, 
the ProLoader object is removed from the Stage, and then the playhead of each 
movie clip on the Stage moves to the first frame and begins playing. 
3 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional to preview the movie. 
Click on any of the four sections, and then click on the loaded content to return 
to the main movie.
When you return to the main movie, all four movie clips play their nested 
animations. 
Creating Masks
Masking is a way of selectively hiding and displaying content on a layer. Masking is 
a way for you to control the content that your audience sees. For example, you can 
make a circular mask and allow your audience to see only through the circular area, 
so that you get a keyhole or spotlight effect. In Flash, you put a mask on one layer 
and the content that is masked in a layer below it.
Masks can be animated, and the content that is masked can also be animated. The 
circular mask can grow bigger to show more content, or the content can scroll 
under a mask like scenery whizzing by a train window.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 357
define the Mask and Masked layers
You’ll create a rectangular mask that starts small and grows larger to cover the 
Stage. The resulting effect reveals the contents of the Masked layer slowly, similar 
to a sliding door opening.
1 Open the file page2.fla.
A single layer called content contains a movie clip of the second section about a 
new car. 
2 Insert a new layer above the content layer and rename it mask.
3 Double-click the icon in front of the layer name, or choose Modify > Timeline > 
Layer Properties.
The Layer Properties dialog box appears.

358 
Lesson 9 
Loading and Controlling Flash Content
4 Select Mask and click OK.
The top layer becomes a Mask layer. Anything that is drawn in this layer will act 
as a mask for a Masked layer below it.
5 Double-click the icon in front of the bottom layer named content, or choose 
Modify > Timeline > Layer Properties.
The Layer Properties dialog box appears.
6 Select Masked and click OK.
The bottom layer becomes a Masked layer and is indented, indicating that it is 
affected by the mask above it.
P Note: You can also 
simply drag a normal 
layer under a Mask layer, 
and Flash will convert it 
to a Masked layer.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 359
Create the mask
The mask can be any filled shape. The color of the fill doesn’t matter. What’s impor-
tant to Flash is the size, location, and contours of the shape. The shape will be the 
“peephole” through which you’ll see the content on the layer below. You can use 
any of the drawing tools to create the fill for your mask.
1 Select the Rectangle tool.
2 Choose any color for the Fill and no stroke for the Stroke.
3 Select the top Mask layer and draw a thin rectangle just off to the left of the 
Stage. Make the height of the rectangle slightly larger than the Stage.
4 Right-click/Ctrl-click the rectangle and select Create Motion Tween.

360 
Lesson 9 
Loading and Controlling Flash Content
5 Flash asks to convert the rectangular shape to a symbol so you can apply a 
motion tween. Click OK.
The top layer becomes a Tween layer, and one second’s worth of frames is added 
to the Timeline.
6 Insert the same number of frames in the bottom layer.
7
Move the playhead to the last frame, frame 24.
8
Select the Free Transform tool.
9
Click on the rectangular symbol.
The free transform handles appear around the rectangular symbol.

Adobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 361
10 Hold down the Alt/Option key and drag the right edge of the free transform 
handle to expand the rectangle to cover the entire Stage.
Flash creates a new keyframe in the last frame, where the rectangle becomes 
wider. The motion tween creates a smooth animation of the rectangle growing 
wider and covering the Stage.
11 To see the effects of the Mask layer on its Masked layer, lock both layers. Scrub 
the red playhead back and forth along the Timeline to see how the motion 
tween uncovers the content in the bottom layer.
12 Insert a new layer and rename it actionscript.
13 Insert a keyframe at the last frame of the actionscript layer and open the 
Actions panel.
14 Enter stop(); in the first line of the Script pane of the Actions panel.

362 
Lesson 9 
Loading and Controlling Flash Content
15 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
As the motion tween proceeds in the Mask layer, more of the Masked layer 
is revealed, creating a cinematic transition known as a wipe. If you open  
09_workingcopy.fla and choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional, 
and then click on the car movie clip, you’ll see that the masking effect is 
preserved even as it is loaded into another Flash movie.
P Note: Flash does 
not recognize different 
Alpha levels of a mask. 
For example, a mask 
drawn with a fill at an 
Alpha value of 50% 
will not reveal the 
underlying content 
at 50%. However, 
with ActionScript 
you can dynamically 
create masks that will 
allow transparencies. 
Masks also do not 
recognize strokes.

review answers
1 You use ActionScript to load external Flash content. You create two objects: a 
ProLoader and a URLRequest object. The URLRequest object specifies the filename 
and file location of the SWF file that you want to load. To load the file, use the load()
command to load the URLRequest object into the ProLoader object. Then display the 
ProLoader object on the Stage with the addChild() command.
2 Loading external content keeps your overall project in separate modules and prevents 
the project from becoming too bloated and difficult to download. It also makes it 
easier for you to edit, because you can edit individual sections instead of one, large, 
unwieldy file.
3 You can control the Timeline of movie clips with ActionScript by first targeting them 
by their instance name. After the name, type a dot (period), and then the command 
that you desire. You can use the same commands for navigation that you learned in 
Lesson 6 (gotoAndStop, gotoAndPlay, stop, play). Flash targets that particular 
movie clip and moves its Timeline accordingly.
4 Masking is a way of selectively hiding and displaying content on a layer. In Flash, you 
put a mask on the top Mask layer and the content in the layer below it, which is called 
the Masked layer. Both the Mask and the Masked layers can be animated. To see the 
effects of the Mask layer on the Masked layer, you must lock both layers.

Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
getting started
In this lesson, you’ll publish several projects that have already been completed to 
learn about various output options. The first project is an animated banner for the 
familiar fictional city of Meridien. You’ll publish the movie for playback in a desk-
top browser. The second project is the interactive restaurant guide for Meridien 
that you completed in Lesson 6. For that project, you’ll target Adobe AIR, which 
creates a stand-alone application that runs on the desktop outside the browser. 
Finally, you’ll test the interactivity for a third project for a mobile device.  
1 Double-click the 10Start_banner.fla, 10Start_restaurantguide.fla, and 10Start_
mobileapp.fla files in the Lesson10/10Start folder to open the three projects.
The three projects are relatively simple, each having unique Stage dimensions 
that are suited for their final published playback environments.

ADobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 367
2 In the Properties Inspector for each project, notice that the Target is set for 
different options.
The banner ad targets the Flash Player, the restaurant guide targets AIR for 
Desktop, and the mobile app targets AIR for Android.
testing a Flash Document
Before we get to the completed Flash files, consider the troubleshooting process that 
happens before you publish. Troubleshooting is a skill you develop over time, but it’s 
easier to identify the cause of problems if you test your movie frequently as you create 
content. If you test after each step, you know which changes you made and therefore 
what might have gone wrong. A good motto to remember is “Test early. Test often.”
One fast way to preview a movie is to choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash 
Professional (Ctrl+Enter/Command+Return), as you’ve done in earlier lessons. 
This command creates a SWF file in the same location as your FLA file so you can 
play and preview the movie directly within the Flash application; it does not create 
the HTML file necessary to play the movie in a Web browser. 
When you believe you’ve completed your movie or a portion of the movie, take 
the time to make sure all the pieces are in place and that they perform the way you 
expect them to.
1 Review the storyboard for the project, if you have one, or other documents that 
describe the purpose and requirements of the project. If such documents do not 
exist, write a description of what you expect to see when you view the movie. 
Include information about the length of the animation, any buttons or links 
included in the movie, and what should be visible as the movie progresses.
2 Using the storyboard, project requirements, or your written description, create 
a checklist that you can use to verify that the movie meets your expectations.
P Note: The default 
behavior for your movie 
in Test Movie mode is to 
loop. You can make your 
SWF play differently in 
a browser by selecting 
different publish 
settings, as described 
later in this lesson, or by 
adding ActionScript to 
stop the Timeline. 

368 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
3 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional. As the movie plays, 
compare it with your checklist. Click buttons and links to ensure they behave as 
expected. You should click on every possibility that a user may encounter. This 
process is called QA, or quality assurance. In larger projects, it may be referred 
to as beta testing.
4 For movies that play with the Flash Player, choose File > Publish Preview > 
Default-(HTML) to export a SWF file and an HTML file required to play in 
a browser and to preview the movie. 
A browser opens, if one is not already open, and plays the final movie.
5 Upload the two files (the SWF and HTML) to your own Web server and give 
your colleagues or friends the Web site address so they can help you test 
the movie. Ask them to run the movie on different computers with different 
browsers to ensure that all the files are included and that the movie meets the 
criteria on your checklist. Encourage testers to view the movie as though they 
were its target audience.
If your project requires additional media, such as FLV or F4V video files, skin 
files for your video, or imported external SWF files, you must upload them 
along with your SWF and HTML file in the same relative location as they were 
on your computer hard drive.
6 Make changes and corrections as necessary to finalize the movie, upload the 
revised files, and then test it again to ensure it meets your criteria. The iterative 
process of testing and making revisions may not sound like fun, but it is a 
critical part of launching a successful Flash project.
clearing the Publish cache
When you test your movie by choosing Control > Test Movie > in Flash 
Professional to generate a SWF, Flash puts compressed copies of any fonts and 
sounds from your project into the Publish Cache. When you test your movie again, 
Flash uses the versions in the cache if the fonts and sounds are unchanged to speed 
up the export of the SWF file. However, you can manually purge the cache by choos-
ing Control > Clear Publish Cache. If you want to clear the cache and test the movie, 
choose Control > Clear Publish Cache and Test Movie.

understanding Publishing
Publishing is the process that creates the required file or files to play your final 
Flash project for your viewers. Keep in mind that Flash Professional CS6 is the 
authoring application, which is a different environment from where your viewers 
experience your movie. In Flash Professional CS6, you author content. In the target 
environment, such as a desktop browser or a mobile device, your viewers watch 
the content when it plays back, or runs. So developers make a distinction between 
“author-time” and “run-time.” 
Adobe provides various runtime environments for playing back your Flash con-
tent. The most common for a browser running on the desktop is the Flash Player. 
Flash Player 11.2 is the latest version and supports all the new features in Flash 
Professional CS6. The Flash Player is available as a free plug-in from the Adobe 
Web site for all the major browsers and platforms. In Google Chrome, the Flash 
Player comes pre-installed and updates automatically.
Adobe AIR is another runtime environment to play Flash content. AIR runs Flash 
content directly from your desktop, without the need for a browser. When you 
publish your content for AIR, you make it available as an installer that creates a 
stand-alone application. You can also publish applications that can be installed and 
run on Android devices and even iOS mobile devices such as the iPhone or iPad, 
whose browsers do not support the Flash Player.
Knowing your audience and understanding the target playback environment is 
essential for your success. 
Publishing for the Web
When you want to publish a movie for the Web, you target a Web browser’s Flash 
Player. Flash content for the Web requires a SWF file for the Flash Player and an 
HTML document that tells the Web browser how to display the Flash content. You 
need to upload both files to your Web server along with any other files your SWF 
file references (such as FLV or F4V video files and skins). By default, the Publish 
command saves all the required files to the same folder.
You can specify different options for publishing a movie, including whether to 
detect the version of Flash Player installed on the viewer’s computer.
specifying Flash file settings
You can determine how Flash publishes the SWF file, including which version of 
Flash Player it requires, which version of ActionScript it uses, and how the movie 
is displayed and plays.
1 Open the 10Start_banner.fla file.
P Note: When you 
change the settings in 
the Publish Settings 
dialog box, they 
are saved with the 
document. 

370 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
2 Choose File > Publish Settings, or click the Publish Settings button in the Profile 
section of the Properties inspector.
The Publish Settings dialog box appears with the general settings at the top, the 
formats on the left, and additional options for selected formats on the right.
The Flash and the HTML Wrapper formats should already be checked.
3 At the top of the Publish Settings dialog box, select a version of Flash Player. 
The latest version is Flash Player 11.2.
Some Flash Professional CS6 features will not play as expected in versions 
of the player earlier than Flash Player 11.2. If you’re using the latest features of 
Flash CS6, you should choose Flash Player 11.2. Only choose an earlier version 
of the Flash Player if you are targeting a specific audience that does not have the 
latest version.
4 Select the appropriate ActionScript version. You’ve used ActionScript 3.0 in 
lessons in this book, so choose ActionScript 3.0.

ADobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 371
5 Select the Flash (.swf) format on the left side of the dialog box.
The options for the SWF file appear on the right. Expand the ADVANCED 
section to see more options.
6 If you wish, you can modify the output filename and location by entering a new 
filename. For this lesson, leave the Output file as 10Start_banner.swf.
7 If you’ve included bitmaps in your movie, you can set a global quality setting for 
JPEG compression levels. Enter a value from 0 (lowest quality) to 100 (highest 
quality). The value of 80 is the default, which you can leave as is for this lesson.
8 If you’ve included sound, click on the Audio stream or Audio event values to 
modify the quality of the audio compression. 
The higher the bitrate, the better the sound quality will be. In this interactive 
banner, there is no sound, so there’s no need to change the settings.
P Note: In the 
Bitmap properties 
dialog box for each 
imported bitmap, you 
can choose to use the 
JPEG Quality set in the 
Publish Settings, or 
choose a setting unique 
for that bitmap. This 
allows you to publish 
higher-quality images 
where you need it—for 
example, in photos of 
people, and lower-
quality images where 
you can get away with 
it—for example, in 
background textures.

372 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
9 Make sure Compress movie is checked to reduce file size and download times.
Deflate is the default option. Choose LZMA for better SWF compression. You’ll 
see the biggest improvements in file size compression if your project consists of 
more ActionScript code and vector graphics.
10 Make sure Include XMP metadata is checked if you want to include information 
that describes your movie.
11 Select the HTML Wrapper format on the left side of the dialog box.
12 Select the Flash Only option from the Template menu.
Detecting the version of Flash Player
You can automatically detect the version of Flash Player on a viewer’s computer; 
if the Flash Player version is not the one required, a message will prompt the viewer 
to download the updated player.
1 If necessary, choose File > Publish Settings, or click the Publish Settings button 
in the Profile section of the Properties inspector.
2 Select the HTML Wrapper format on the left side of the dialog box.
3 Select Detect Flash Version. 
P Note: To learn about 
other template options, 
select one and then 
click Info.

ADobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 373
4 In the Version fields, enter the earliest version of the Flash Player to detect.
5 Click Publish, and then click OK to close the dialog box.
Flash publishes three files. Flash creates a SWF file, an HTML file, and an 
additional file named swfobject.js that contains extra JavaScript code that 
will detect the specified Flash Player version. If the browser does not have 
the earliest Flash Player version you entered in the Version fields, a message 
is displayed instead of the Flash movie. All three files need to be uploaded to 
your Web server and are necessary for your movie.
changing display settings
You have many options for changing the way your Flash movie is displayed in a 
browser. The Size and Scale settings for the HTML Wrapper work together to 
determine the movie’s size and amount of distortion and cropping.
1 Choose File > Publish Settings, or click the Publish Settings button in the Profile 
section of the Properties inspector.
2 Select the HTML Wrapper format on the left side of the dialog box.
• Select Match Movie for the Size to play the Flash movie at the exact Stage 
size set in Flash. This is the usual setting for almost all your Flash projects.

374 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
•
Select Pixels for the Size to enter a different size in pixels for your Flash movie.
•
Select Percent for the Size to enter a different size for your Flash movie as a 
percentage of the browser window. 
3 Click on the Scale and Alignment option to expand the advanced settings below it.
•
Select Default (Show all) for the Scale option to fit the movie in the browser 
window without any distortions or cropping to show all the content. This 
is the usual setting for almost all your Flash projects. If a user reduces the 
size of the browser window, the content remains constant but is clipped by 
the window.
•
Select Percent for Size and No border for the Scale option to scale the movie 
to fit the browser window without any distortions but with cropping of the 
content to fill the window.

ADobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 375
•
Select Percent for Size and Exact fit for the Scale option to scale the movie 
to fill the browser window on both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. 
With these options, none of the background color shows, but the content 
can be distorted.
• Select Percent for Size and No scale for the Scale option to keep the movie 
size constant no matter how big or small the browser window is.

376 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
changing Playback settings
You can change several options that affect the way your Flash movie plays within 
a browser.
1 Choose File > Publish Settings, or click the Publish Settings button in the Profile 
section of the Properties inspector.
2 Select the HTML Wrapper format on the left side of the dialog box.
•
Select Paused at start for the Playback option to have the movie pause at the 
very first frame.
•
Deselect Loop for the Playback option to have the movie play only once.
•
Deselect Display menu for the Playback option to limit the options in the 
context menu that appears when you right-click/Ctrl-click on a Flash movie 
in a browser.
understanding the bandwidth Profiler
You can preview how your final project might behave in different download envi-
ronments by using the Bandwidth Profiler, a useful panel that is available when you 
are in Test Movie mode.
View the bandwidth Profiler
The Bandwidth Profiler provides information such as the overall file size, the total 
number of frames, the dimensions of the Stage, and how your data is distributed 
throughout your frames. You can use the Bandwidth Profiler to pinpoint where 
there are large amounts of data so you can see where there may be pauses in the 
movie playback.
1 Choose Control > Test Movie > in Flash Professional.
Flash exports a SWF and displays your movie in a new window.
P Note: In general, it 
is best to control a Flash 
movie with ActionScript 
than to rely on the 
Playback settings in the 
Publish Settings dialog 
box. For example, add a 
stop() command in the 
very first frame of your 
Timeline if you want to 
pause the movie at the 
start. When you test 
your movie (Control > 
Test Movie > in Flash 
Professional), all the 
functionality will be 
in place.

ADobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 377
2 Choose View > Bandwidth Profiler. 
A new window appears above your movie. Basic information about your movie 
is listed on the left side of the profiler. A timeline appears on the right side of 
the profiler with gray bars representing the amount of data in each frame. The 
higher the bars, the more data is included.
You can view the graph on the right in two ways: as a Streaming Graph (View > 
Streaming Graph) or as a Frame By Frame Graph (View > Frame By Frame Graph). 
The Streaming Graph indicates how the movie downloads over the Web by show-
ing you how data streams from each frame, whereas the Frame By Frame Graph 
simply indicates the amount of data in each frame. In Streaming Graph mode, you 
can tell which frames will cause hang-ups during playback by noting which bar 
exceeds the given Bandwidth setting.
test download performance
You can set different download speeds and test the playback performance of your 
movie under those different conditions.
1 While in Test Movie mode, choose View > Download Settings > DSL.
The DSL setting is a type of Internet connection and a measure of the download 
speed that you want to test. It corresponds to 32.6 kilobytes per second. Choose 
higher or lower speeds depending on your target audience.

378 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
2 Choose View > Simulate Download.
Flash simulates playback over the Web at the given Bandwidth setting (DSL). A 
green horizontal bar at the top of the window indicates which frames have been 
downloaded, and the triangular playhead marks the current frame that plays. 
Notice that there is a slight delay at frame 1 while the data downloads. Anytime 
a gray data bar exceeds the red horizontal line (the one marked 1.1 KB), there 
will be a slight delay in the playback of your movie.
Once sufficient data has downloaded, the movie plays, though you may still see 
some pauses when the playhead catches up to the downloaded portions.
3 Choose View > Download Settings > T1.
T1 is a much faster broadband connection than DSL, which simulates download 
speeds of 131.2 kilobytes per second.
4 Choose View > Simulate Download.
Flash simulates playback over the Web at the faster speed. Notice that the delay 
at the beginning is very brief, and the movie plays almost seamlessly as the 
movie downloads quick enough so the playhead never catches up.
5 Close the preview window.
adding metadata
Metadata is information about data. Metadata describes your Flash file so other 
developers with whom you share your FLA can see details that you want them to 
know, or a search engine on the Web can find and share your movie. Metadata 
includes a document’s title, a description, keywords, the date the file was created, 
and any other information about the document. You can add metadata to a Flash

other applications and Web search engines to catalog your movie.

6 In the Keywords field, type Meridien, Meridien City, relocation, tourism, 
travel, urban, visitor guide, vacation, city entertainment, destinations.
7 Enter any other descriptive information in the other fields. Click OK to close the 
dialog box. Click OK to close the Publish Settings dialog box.
The metadata will be saved with the Flash document and will be available for 
other applications and Web search engines.
Publishing a Desktop application
Most desktop computers have the Flash Player installed with their browsers, but 
you may want to distribute your movie to someone who doesn’t have the Flash 
Player or who has an older version. Perhaps you just want your movie to run with-
out a browser.
You can output your movie as a projector, which is a stand-alone file that includes 
the Flash Player with your movie. Because a projector contains the Flash Player, 
projector files are larger than SWF files.
You can also output your movie as an AIR file, which installs an application on the 
user’s desktop. Adobe AIR is a more robust runtime environment that supports 
a broader range of technologies. Viewers download the free Adobe AIR runtime 
from Adobe’s Web site at http://get.adobe.com/air/. 
creating a projector
You must create a projector that is specific for Windows or for the 
Macintosh. However, you can create both kinds of projectors from 
either platform.
1 Choose File > Publish Settings, or click the Publish Settings 
button in the Profile section of the Properties inspector.
2 Deselect the Flash and HTML Wrapper formats. Select Win 
Projector and Mac Projector.

3
Click Publish.
4
When the files have been published, click OK to close the dialog box.
5
Open the Lesson10/10Start folder. 
The Windows Projector file has an .exe extension and 
the Mac Projector file has an .app extension, though 
your operating system may hide the extension in 
the filename.
6 Open the projector file for your platform (Windows or Mac). 
Both the Windows and the Mac projectors can be double-clicked to play 
without a browser.
Projectors and tlF text
The interactive banner in this lesson doesn’t contain 
any TLF Text. However, if your movie includes TLF Text 
and you want to create a projector, you must merge the 
Text Layout SWF into the projector. The Text Layout SWF 
contains the necessary code that supports the new TLF 
Text engine. Click the Edit button for ActionScript Settings 
in the Properties inspector or the ActionScript Settings 
button in the Publish Settings dialog box.
In the Advanced ActionScript 3.0 Settings dialog box that 
appears, click the Library path tab and then the textLay-
out.swc file in the window below the tab. 
Select Merged into code for the Default linkage in the 
Runtime Shared Library Settings near the bottom.
The TLF Text engine that is listed in the display window 
now shows that its Link Type is to be merged into code 
rather than linked to a shared external library. This means 
that the code for the TLF Text engine will be included in 
the single projector file.
Refer to Lesson 7 for more information about TLF Text and 
the additional Text Layout SWF.

382 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
creating an aiR application
Adobe AIR allows your viewers to see your Flash content on their desktop as 
an application.
1 Open 10Start_restaurantguide.fla.
This is the same interactive restaurant guide that you created in Lesson 6, 
with a few modifications to the background image. 
2 In the Properties inspector, note that the Target is set to AIR 3.2 for Desktop.
AIR 3.2 is the latest version of the Adobe AIR runtime. 
3 Click the Edit application settings button (wrench icon) next to the Target.
The AIR Settings dialog box appears. 

ADobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 383
You can also open the AIR Settings dialog box from the Publish Settings dialog 
box. Click the Player Settings button (wrench icon) next to the Target.
4 Examine the settings under the General tab.
The Output file shows the filename of the published AIR installer as 10Start_
restaurantguide.air. The Output as options provide three ways to create an AIR 
application. The first choice should be selected:
•
AIR package creates a platform-independent AIR installer.
•
Mac or Windows installer creates a platform-specific AIR installer.
•
Application with runtime embedded creates an application without an 
installer or the need for the AIR runtime already on the desktop.
5 In the Name/App Name field, enter Meridien Restaurant Guide.
This is the name of your application.
6 In the Window style, choose Custom Chrome (transparent).
Custom Chrome (transparent) creates an application without any interface or 
frame elements (known as chrome), and with a transparent background.

384 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
7 Click the Signature tab at the top of the AIR Settings dialog  box.
Creating an AIR application requires a certificate so that users can trust and 
identify the developer of the Flash content. For this lesson, you won’t need an 
official certificate, so you can create your own self-signed certificate.
8 Click the New/Create button next to Certificate.
9 Enter your information in the empty fields. You can use Meridien Press for 
Publisher name, Digital for the Organization unit, and Interactive for the 
Organization name. Enter your own password in both password fields, and then 
save the file as meridienpress. Click on the Folder/Browse button to save it in a 
folder of your choice. Click OK.
A self-signed certificate (.p12) file is created on your computer. Make sure that 
the Password field is filled, and that Remember password for this session and 
Timestamp is checked.
10 Now click on the Icons tab at the top of the AIR Settings dialog box.
11 Select icon 128x128 and click the folder icon.

ADobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 385
12 Navigate to the AppIconsForPublish folder inside the 10Start folder and choose 
the restaurantguide.png file provided for you.
The image in the restaurantguide.png file will appear as the application icon on 
the desktop.
13 Finally, click on the Advanced tab at the top of the AIR Settings dialog box.
14 Under Initial window settings, enter 0 for the X field and 50 for the Y field.

386 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
When the application launches, it will appear flushed to the left side of the 
screen and 50 pixels from the top.
15 Click Publish.
Flash creates an AIR installer (.air).
installing an aiR application
The AIR installer is platform-independent, but requires that the AIR runtime is 
installed on the user’s system.
1 Double-click the AIR installer that you just created, 10Start_restaurantguide.air.
The Adobe AIR Application Installer opens and asks to install the application. 
Since you used a self-signed certificate to create the AIR installer, Adobe warns 
of a potential security risk. 
2 Click Install, and then click Continue to proceed with the installation at the 
default settings.
The application called Meridien Restaurant Guide is installed on your computer 
and automatically opens.

ADobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 387
Notice that the application is positioned at x=0, y=50, and that the Stage is 
transparent so your graphic elements float over the desktop, much like the 
appearance of other applications.
3 Quit the application by pressing Alt+F4/Cmd+Q.
Publishing for a mobile Device
You can also publish Flash content for mobile devices running on Android or on 
Apple’s iOS, such as the iPhone or iPad. To publish Flash content for a mobile 
device, you target AIR for Android or AIR for iOS to create an application that 
viewers download and install on their devices.
Creating an app for mobile devices is a little more complicated than creating an 
application for the desktop because you have to obtain specific developer cer-
tificates for distribution. Moreover, you have to factor in the additional time and 
effort required for testing and debugging on a separate device. However, Flash 
Professional CS6 features a mobile device simulator that can help make that testing 
and debugging easier. The simulator can emulate specific mobile device interac-
tions such as tilting the device (using the accelerometer), touch gestures such as 
swiping and pinching, or even using the geolocation functions.
simulating a mobile app
You’ll use the Adobe SimController to simulate mobile device interactions within 
Flash Professional CS6.
1 Open 10Start_mobileapp.fla.

388 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
The project is a simple application with four keyframes that announces an 
imaginary sports challenge set in our familiar city of Meridien. The project 
already contains ActionScript that enables the viewer to swipe the Stage left 
or right to go to the next or previous frames.
Examine the code in the Actions panel. The code was added using the Code 
Snippets panel, which includes dozens of code snippets for interactivity on 
mobile devices.
2 In the Properties inspector, notice that the Target is set for AIR 3.2 for Android. 
3 Choose Control > Test Movie > in AIR Debug Launcher (Mobile), which should 
already be checked.
The project publishes to a new window. In addition, the SimController launches, 
which provides options to interact with the Flash content.
P Note: On Windows, 
a security warning 
may appear when you 
use the AIR Debug 
Launcher. Click Allow 
access to continue.

ADobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 389
4 In the Simulator panel, click Touch and Gesture to expand that section. 
5 Check the Touch layer box to enable it.
The simulator overlays a transparent gray box over the Flash content to simulate 
the touch surface of the mobile device.
You can change the opacity of the touch layer by changing the Alpha value, 
if you wish.
6 Choose Gesture > Swipe.
The simulator is now enabled to emulate a swipe interaction. The instructions at 
the bottom of the panel detail how you can create the interaction with just your 
mouse cursor.

390 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
7 Press down on the touch layer over your Flash content, drag to the left, and then 
let go of your mouse button. 
The yellow dot represents the contact point on the touch layer of the mobile device.
The project recognizes the swipe interaction, and the second keyframe appears.
8 Swipe left and right.
Flash advances ahead one frame, or moves back one frame.
Publishing a movie for html5
A free extension available for Flash Professional CS6 called Toolkit for CreateJS allows 
you to publish your Flash content as HTML5. HTML5 is the latest Web standard for 
browsers. One of the key features of HTML5 is the new <canvas> tag, which supports 
more sophisticated rendering and animation without the need for the Flash Player.
Once installed, the Toolkit for CreateJS extension appears as a new panel within Flash 
Professional CS6. From the panel, you can export Flash content, including animation, 
sounds, and images, to HTML5. The Toolkit uses several JavaScript libraries (collec-
tively known as CreateJS) to output a faithful representation of your Flash content.
At the time of this publication, the Toolkit supports only Classic Tween animations 
and a small subset of Flash Professional’s capabilities. The Toolkit for CreateJS is in 
only its first iteration, and in time, Adobe will be adding additional support and 
features. Keep your eye on Adobe’s Web site for any updates and news about this 
exciting new tool. It will undoubtedly become a valuable bridge between the Flash 
Professional platform and the emerging standard of HTML5. 

ADobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 391
Keeping organized with Projects
If you intend to target multiple target environments with the same Flash content—
for example, you want to create a game that runs as both a Web site and as a mobile 
app—then it’s useful to begin your project through the Project panel rather than as 
individual documents. The Project panel (Window > Project, or Shift+F8) organizes 
more complex projects by streamlining the sharing of common assets.
starting a new project
You’ll create a new project through the Project panel.
1 In Flash, choose Window > Project, or press Shift+F8. You can also click on the 
Projects icon (
).
The Project panel appears.
2 From the top of the Project panel, choose Projects > New Project. 
The Create New Project dialog box appears.
3 For Project name, enter animation_web. 
4 For Root folder, click on the folder icon to browse your computer directory. 
Create a new folder in the 10Start folder called myproject.

392 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
5 Click Create Project. 
Flash creates your new folder and creates a new project document 
called animation_web.fla. Associated with the file is another file called 
AuthortimeSharedAssets.fla. Additional project documents can share common 
Library assets through this file.
sharing library symbols
You’ll create a second document for your project, and both files will share a 
common Library symbol. This makes editing simple and efficient. You can make 
changes to the symbol in one document, and those changes will be automatically 
reflected in the other document.
1 In the new animation_web.fla file that’s open in Flash, create a simple shape 
and convert it to a movie clip symbol. Leave an instance of your symbol on the 
Stage.
In this example, you see a simple square created with the Rectangle tool. 
2 In the Library panel, check the box under the Linkage column next to your new 
symbol.
Flash stores your new symbol in the AuthortimeSharedAssets.fla file so other 
files in the same project can access it.
3 Open the Project panel and click the New File button at the bottom.
The Create File dialog box appears. 

ADobe FLAsh ProFessionAL Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 393
4 For Name, enter animation_mobile, and for Target, choose AIR 3.2 for 
Android. Check the Open file after creation box.
5 Click Create File.
Flash creates and opens a new document in your project. You now have two 
documents open, the animation_web.fla file and the animation_mobile.fla file. 
6 Now you’ll add the shared movie clip symbol to animation_mobile.fla. In the 
Project panel, double-click the AuthortimeSharedAssets.fla file.
The AuthortimeSharedAssets.fla file opens. Notice that the shared symbol is in 
the Library.
7 Go back to the animation_mobile.fla file, 
and from the top of its Library, choose 
AuthortimeSharedAssets.fla.
Flash opens the Library for 
AuthortimeSharedAssets.fla for your 
current document. 
8 Drag the shared symbol from the Library to the 
Stage of the animation_mobile.fla file.
The symbol appears on the Stage.
9 From the top of the Library panel, choose 
animation_mobile.fla to see the document’s own 
Library. Check the box under the Linkage column 
next to the symbol.
Flash links the symbol to the 
AuthortimeSharedAssets.fla file. Now both 
files share the same symbol. Making and saving 
changes in any of the three documents will make 
changes in all of them.

394 
Lesson 10 
Publishing Flash Documents
editing shared library symbols
You’ll make a simple edit to the symbol in one file and see the changes reflected in 
the other file.
1 In the animation_web.fla file, double-click the symbol instance on the Stage to 
enter symbol-editing mode.
2 Modify the shape of the symbol by changing its color or contours.
The red square in this example has been changed to a green trapezoid.
3 Save your file.
Flash updates the symbol in the AuthortimeSharedAssets.fla file. 
4 Open the animation_mobile.fla file.
The shared symbol automatically reflects all the modifications from the 
animation_web.fla file.
next steps
Congratulations! You’ve made it through the last lesson. By now you’ve seen how 
Flash Professional CS6, in the right creative hands (your hands!), has all the features 
to produce media-rich, interactive projects that run on multiple platforms. You’ve 
completed these lessons—many of them from scratch—so you understand how the 
various tools, panels, and ActionScript work together for real-world applications.
But there’s always more to learn. Continue practicing your Flash skills by creating 
your own animation or interactive site. Get inspired by seeking out Flash projects 
on the Web. Expand your ActionScript knowledge by exploring the Adobe Flash 
Help resources and other fine Adobe Classroom in a Book manuals.

Review Questions
1 What is the Bandwidth Profiler, and why is it useful?
2 What files do you need to upload to a server to ensure your final Flash movie plays in 
Web browsers?
3 How can you tell which version of Flash Player a viewer has installed, and why is 
it important?
4 Define metadata. How do you add it to a Flash document?
5 What is a projector file?
Review answers
1 The Bandwidth Profiler provides information such as the overall file size, the total 
number of frames, the dimensions of the Stage, and how your data is distributed 
throughout your frames. You can use the Bandwidth Profiler to preview how your final 
project might behave under different download environments.
2 To ensure that your movie plays as expected in Web browsers, upload the Flash SWF file 
and the HTML document that tells the browser how to display the SWF file. You also 
need to upload the swfobject.js file, if one was published, and any files your SWF file 
references, such as video or other SWF files; be sure that they are in the same relative 
location (usually the same folder as the final SWF file) as they were on your hard drive.
3 Select Detect Flash Version in the HTML tab in the Publish Settings dialog box to 
automatically detect the version of Flash Player on a viewer’s computer. Some Flash 
features require specific versions of Flash Player to play as expected.
4 Metadata is information about data. Metadata includes a document’s title, a 
description, keywords, the date the file was created, and any other information about 
the document. Metadata in a Flash document is published with the Flash file, making 
it easy for others to identify the project. 
5 A projector is a stand-alone application that includes all the information necessary to 
play the movie without a browser, so people who don’t have the Flash Player or who 
don’t have the current version can view your movie.
