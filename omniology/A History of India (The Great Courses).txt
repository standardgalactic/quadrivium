A History of India
Scope
Over the past 5,000 years, the cultures and people of the Indian 
subcontinent have developed in fascinating and complex ways. Today, 
India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh comprise one of the most dynamic and 
increasingly significant parts of humanity. South Asians currently total 
20 percent of the world’s population. The Republic of India alone will 
in less than a decade surpass China in size. Indians have long been part 
of globalization through trade, the spread of religions, and migration. 
The best way to understand present conditions in India, Pakistan, and 
Bangladesh is to follow the development of their people from the origins 
of humans in the region up to the present.
The Indian subcontinent’s diverse geography ranges from just north of 
the equator for more than 2,000 miles north into the glacial Himalaya 
mountains. Rivers and mountains define its many environmentally 
diverse regions, each with its own ecology. Over 50 centuries, various 
people have immigrated into each region, developing dozens of distinct 
languages, economies, societies, and governments. While outsiders may 
think of the Indian subcontinent as one place, it has rarely ever been 
united under a single ruler or culture.
Various Indian lands have been settled over the centuries by multiple 
waves of immigrants, from Africa, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and 
Europe. Some forest-dwelling communities descended from the earliest 
humans to enter India. One of the first urban civilizations in the world 
arose along the Indus River, with its own system of writing as old as 
that of any in history. The major religions of Hinduism and Buddhism 
emerged as other cities and kingdoms developed more than 2,000 years 
ago. Other, smaller religious communities also created other ways of 
believing and living. Later immigrants added Judaism, Christianity, 
Zoroastrianism, and Islam. Occasionally, empires under Buddhist,

Hindu, Muslim, and Christian rulers temporarily extended over much 
of the subcontinent, but regional identities persisted within or apart from 
them. India much like Western Europe in its geographical, political, and 
ethnic variety, but there have always been more people living in on the 
Indian subcontinent than in Europe or the Americas combined.
Over the last seven decades, the people of the new, emerging nations 
of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh individually and collectively have a 
rich array of achievements. But they also face vital challenges. While all 
three nations are committed to representative democracy, they also have 
endured different degrees of authoritarianism. India and Pakistan have 
already fought multiple wars, and each now has a substantial stockpile 
of nuclear weapons. They are participating ever more in the global 
economy, generating great wealth, but they also contain about one-third 
of all the poor people on earth. 
Over this course’s 36 lectures, we will explore the reasons this major part 
of humanity has developed in its own distinctive ways over time. ■

Lecture 1
Earliest History of the Indian 
Subcontinent
I
n order to understand the people living on the Indian subcontinent, 
it’s important to start by exploring its environment: the land, the 
atmosphere, and the interactions between them. In this lecture, and 
the course overall, we’ll see how this complex environment affected the 
culture and people of India, and how they altered that environment. After 
exploring the environment, this lecture will introduce some terminology 
that will be important for the rest of the course.
India’s Geographic History


About 100 million years ago, the huge mass of rock and earth that 
we know as the southern part of Asia was then located at the earth’s 
South Pole. It was next to Africa and Antarctica, and part of a huge 
supercontinent. Plate tectonics, or continental drift, has since helped 
it move to its current position.


The huge Indian tectonic plate is composed of a crust of solidified 
stone, some 20–60 miles thick, floating on the hot molten rock below. 
Gradually breaking away from the southern continent, this Indian 
plate moved northward across what is today the Indian Ocean. 


By about 30 million years ago, this Indian plate began smashing 
into the larger Asian plate, forcing itself under and twisting in the 
process. Most of the major geological features of India today resulted 
from this impact and are still slowly changing. 


One of the major effects of this plate tectonic movement has been 
the creation of various mountain ranges. Along India’s north rise

the vast Himalayan mountains. These mountains are actually the 
southern edge of the Asian tectonic plate, which continues to lift up 
today as the Indian plate slides beneath it. 


The vast weight of these mountains and the continued grinding 
of these two plates cause occasional earthquakes, often of great 
magnitude. India, Pakistan, and Nepal have all suffered severe 
earthquakes already this century.


Nepal and Tibet lie in this Himalayan Mountains region, with 
historical connections both to India and to China. But these 
mountains are so difficult to cross that there has been relatively 
little direct exchange between India and China even though the 
civilizations exist on either side of this same mountain range. 


Because of the angle that the Indian plate smashed into Asia, the 
mountains in India’s northeast are rugged but not as steep. This 
means that people from Southeast Asia, especially what is today 
Thailand and Burma or Myanmar, have interacted with people in 
India’s northeast quite extensively over time. 
The Khyber Pass


In India’s northwest, the mountains are very rugged. But rivers have 
carved passes through them. The most famous is the Khyber Pass, 
which currently runs from Kabul in Afghanistan into Pakistan. This 
is a relatively narrow and twisting passage. 


Many immigrants from Iran, Afghanistan, and central Asia have 
walked or ridden animals through the Khyber and other passes into 
India over the centuries, and much trade has also passed through 
them in each direction. But many invading armies, marching 
into India or out of it, have been decimated by the local people 
shooting down from the steep walls of the Khyber Pass, or halted by 
defending forts.

Lecture 1—Earliest History of the Indian Subcontinent 
5


However, over India’s long history, most successful invaders have 
fought their way through the Khyber and other passes in the 
northwest. Once settled in north India, these conquerors have often 
prepared to defend their new kingdoms against the next set of 
invaders from the northwest. Blocking the Khyber Pass has been an 
important strategy for many rulers of India’s northwest quarter. 
India and the Sea


India has long coastlines, although relatively few secure natural 
harbors. People, ideas, and trade goods have moved back and forth 
across the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal for thousands of years. 


Most people who arrived by sea were sailors, merchants, holy 
men, and immigrants who settled in India. As a result, historically, 
Indian rulers rarely feared people arriving by sea. But then, in 1498, 
the Portuguese admiral Vasco da Gama discovered the direct sea 
passage around southern Africa and reached India. 


This began the long process of invasion by Europeans from the sea. 
Starting in the late 18th century, the British established and expanded 
their colonial rule, conquering inland from the coasts.


The impact from the collision between the Indian and Asian tectonic 
plates also tilted India. The western edge of the Indian plate rose, while 
the eastern edge remained lower. Hence, running just inland along the 
western coast is a long mountain range called the Western Ghats. 


There is also a coastal mountain range along the east, but these 
Eastern Ghats are less imposing since that edge of the Indian plate 
did not rise up. In between the Western and Eastern Ghats is the 
central Indian upland called the Deccan Plateau. 


India also has internal mountain ranges, most running west to east. 
Over the long centuries, most of these internal mountains have 
eroded into rugged hills, but they are still difficult to cross.

A History of India
6


Because of the tilt in the Indian plate and these internal mountain 
ranges, many of India’s major rivers run from west to east across the 
subcontinent. Only two major rivers run differently: The Narmada 
River runs east to west along the northern edge of the Deccan upland, 
while the Indus River system drains the western plain southward, 
along the mountains now in Afghanistan. 


All these mountains and rivers mean that there are four distinct 
macro-regions:


A flat plain that runs across the north, surrounding the famous 
Ganges River. 


India’s central upland, the dry and rugged Deccan Plateau. 


The vast Indus River, which runs from the Himalayas southward 
to the Indian Ocean, and waters an otherwise dry plain. This 
forms the core of Pakistan today. 


India’s southeastern plain, today covered by wet rice paddies. 
This is the agriculturally rich part of India’s peninsular tip. 


Very rarely have these macro-regions ever been united under one 
single government. Instead, much like Western Europe, most of 
India’s long history has seen many different rulers in each of its 
geographically defined macro-regions. 
Climate and Weather Patterns


Out of the annual interaction between these land formations and the 
atmosphere comes India’s dominant rainfall pattern: the monsoons. 
The term monsoon comes from the Arabic word for season, since for 
about four months continuously, the winds largely blow in the same 
direction. 


This predictable wind pattern enabled seamen and merchants in sail-
powered vessels to ride across the Indian Ocean from Arabia and 
east Africa to India during one season, and then ride the prevailing 
wind back in the other direction in the next season. 

Lecture 1—Earliest History of the Indian Subcontinent



There is no experience quite like the monsoon. Imagine hurricane-
like torrents of rain, which pour down every day for months. Yet, 
that rain has always been vital for the entire Indian economy.


As a result of continental drift, the Indian subcontinent now lies 
in the Northern Hemisphere, with the Tropic of Cancer running 
through its middle. Therefore, most of India tends to be quite hot 
throughout much of the year. 


But the very far northern part of India, lying in the Himalayas, 
ranges between cool and very cold, with some glaciers. Hence, the 
Indian subcontinent has an extremely wide climatic range.


Another effect of India being in the Northern Hemisphere is that, 
starting during the spring, it heats up as the sun beats more directly 
on the land. Since the surrounding oceans do not heat up as quickly, 
the warmer air over the land rises up, drawing in winds from 
the southwest. These begin annually in June, and this southwest 
monsoon continues all summer. 

A History of India
8


These southwest winds are heavily laden by moisture from the 
Indian Ocean, so when they hit the Western Ghats, they rise up, cool, 
and drop their moisture in the form of the intense monsoon rains. 
Since these heavy rains make the land amazingly productive, the 
coastal plain west of these mountains can support a rich agricultural 
economy and dense population. But often this rainfall is so 
voluminous that cities, towns, and villages flood. 


As the southwest monsoon continues beyond the Western Ghats, 
it loses much of its moisture. This means that the interior Deccan 
highland, even not even very far from the coast, is much dryer. 


As this southwest monsoon continues across the Bay of Bengal, it 
again picks up moisture and energy. This means that as it curves 
northward, diverted by the landmass of Southeast Asia, it often 
produces cyclones. These drop huge amounts of rainfall on the 
upper eastern coast, mostly in the region of Bengal (which is now 
half in India and half in Bangladesh). 


The southwest monsoon then continues up the Ganges plain, 
diverted by the looming Himalayas. As it moves westward, this 
monsoon gradually decreases in its rainfall, until little or none is left. 
There is consequently a gradual shift from wet rice to dry crops as 
you go west up the Ganges plain. 


By the autumn, the land has cooled enough that the southwest 
monsoon pattern dissipates and begins to reverse. The oceans are 
now relatively warmer than the land, so the northeast monsoon 
begins to blow. Cool winds come off the Himalayas, bringing frost to 
the upper Gangetic plain, but limited rainfall. 


As the northeast monsoon passes over the Bay of Bengal, however, it 
picks up moisture. Therefore, the southeastern region of the Indian 
peninsula receives much of its annual rain during the winter months. 

Lecture 1—Earliest History of the Indian Subcontinent

Niches and Demarcations


Across India are many ecological niches. Each receives a different 
amount of rainfall and is often divided from the next area by 
mountains or rivers. Each also has its own specific ecosystem. 


Within each of these regions, distinctive cultures have developed 
over time. As an indication, the people of the subcontinent today 
speak more than 24 major languages, with hundreds of dialects. Each 
region has had its own political history, often independent.


Regarding this course’s terminology: The term India often refers 
to the entire subcontinent, and we’ll use it that way quite often. 
But since 1947, this Indian subcontinent has been partitioned into 
separate nations: the Republic of India in addition to Pakistan. 
Pakistan initially had western and eastern wings; the latter seceded 
in 1971 to become Bangladesh. Hence, many scholars use the term 
South Asia to describe this region throughout time.


Further, the term India is in itself loaded with meaning. The derivation 
of the name India comes from the Indus River, implying that India is 
the land beyond the Indus. At first only outsiders used the name. The 
term Hindu also comes from this same term, again meaning the belief 
system of people who live beyond the Indus River. Early European 
explorers used the term East Indies for both South and Southeast Asia, 
in contrast to the West Indies, meaning the Caribbean. 


Over most of history, the people living in South Asia did not identify 
themselves as Indian or Hindu, at least until relatively recently. 
Rather, each region of South Asia had its own identity. Many people 
still strongly consider themselves as part of that regional culture, 
with many regions having their own language. 


For the rest of this course: When we learn about the perceptions held 
by people of the culture being studied, we will use the term emic. Of 
course, in a culture as diverse as that of India, there are always many 
different emic perspectives. In contrast, when we are looking from 

A History of India
10
the perspective of outsiders, we will refer to that as an etic viewpoint. 
Again, various outsiders have frequently asserted different 
interpretations of the same event or topic, so there is usually not one 
single etic explanation.

Lecture 2
Migration and the Adivasi
I
ndia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh today are each amazingly diverse 
societies. A vast variety of people and cultures have come together 
over many centuries. Taking the long historical perspective, we can see 
how each new culture contributed. Broadly speaking, we can identify three 
broad origins for ancient South Asia: the original people, the urban-based 
culture of the Indus River, and the Sanskrit-speaking people who are best 
known by their sacred tradition of the Veda. This lecture is devoted to that 
first group: the earliest humans to settle in India and their descendants. 
The Adivasi


Today, over 100 million men and women in India call themselves 
Adivasi, meaning “aboriginal.” This is the largest number of 
aboriginal people in any country around the globe today. 


But the term Adivasi is controversial in India. Advocates for the 
rights of forest dwellers coined this word in the 1930s. The name 
helps them claim descent from the original inhabitants of India, who 
arrived tens of thousands of years earlier. 


As the descendants of the indigenous people, they argue, they have 
moral and legal property rights over all the land that was later taken 
from them by outsiders. But the government of India does not admit 
that these people’s ancestors were in India before anyone else. The 
government officially uses the term tribal, which describes an isolated, 
forest-dwelling way of life and often carries a pejorative connotation. 


Out of respect for the wishes of many of India’s forest-dwelling 
communities, this course will identify them collectively as Adivasi. 
But not all forest-dwellers think of themselves only as Adivasi, so the 

A History of India
12
course will also use the names of individual communities, like the 
Kharia, when they are discussed specifically. 


About 30,000 years ago, Adivasis were 100 percent of people living 
in India. Today, those officially classed as Adivasis compose only 8.6 
percent of India’s total population. This dramatic shift resulted from 
various powerful historical forces and processes. Many of these are 
still active today.
Appreciating the Adivasi


Recovering and appreciating any kind of historical evidence about 
the earliest people who entered India and their descendants presents 
challenges. Adivasi languages had no script until very recently 
(and some to this day don’t have one). Therefore, they produced no 
written historical records. 


Instead, much of our knowledge of the past of these communities 
comes from the Adivasis’ own oral cultural traditions, especially 
about their religious beliefs. Taking just one out of many examples 
of such Adivasi origin accounts, we can look at how the Kharia 

Lecture 2—Migration and the Adivasi 
13
community recounts the creation of the world, including plants, 
animals, and the Kharia themselves. 


The Kharia are only one of the hundreds of distinct Adivasi 
communities who still live in the forested hills of central India. One 
account of their creation story was recorded and translated from the 
Kharia language by two Indian anthropologists, R. C. and S. C. Roy, 
who listened to the Kharia during the early 20th century.


The account tells of the Kharia god Ponomosor, who created the 
earth, then two clay images, one male and one female. These grew 
into the first people, who had offspring themselves. They at first 
lived on “wild fruits and roots,” but after prayer, the god provided 
food for them by creating birds. 


But, this origin account continues, the Kharia people three times 
displeased the god, so he tried to exterminate them with a flood, 
a rain of fire, and then another flood. Each time, only one family of 
Kharia survived. The final time, the only survivors were “one old 
Kharia and his nine sons [and their wives, who had taken] shelter 
in a cave.”


After they emerged from the cave, the sons first killed a deer and 
split it into nine pieces among themselves, then set off in search 
of water. Each had “an entirely different experience, for each had 
seen a different animal or object. … The old man when he heard 
their narratives, decided that each of his nine sons should adopt 
for his respective clan the name of the object he found.” This is an 
explanation by the Kharia of their origin and the reason they have 
nine clans today.


Each Adivasi community has one or more such oral origin histories. 
Most highlight their particular community’s shared descent from the 
same ancestral father and mother. 

A History of India
14
Etic History


Using other kinds of evidence, in contrast, produces a different 
account of the origins of the Adivasis. This is called etic history, 
meaning from outside of the culture being studied. 


Anthropologists 
and 
historians 
are 
using 
recent 
scientific 
technologies like DNA testing and linguistic analysis to reconstruct 
the history of India’s earliest immigrants and their relationships to 
today’s Adivasis. 


Genetic and linguistic analysis strongly shows that most Adivasi 
communities are descended from the very earliest Homo sapiens. 
They began expanding out of Africa about 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. 
Eventually, some of their descendants entered India. We know there 
have been human communities there for at least 30,000 years, and 
perhaps far longer. 


Further, other groups continued to immigrate into India, both from 
the northwest and also from the northeast, leading to diverse and 
intermixed Adivasi cultures. 
Adivasi Communities


Adivasi communities in India found ecological niches. Various 
communities developed locally specific hunting, fishing, and 
gathering economies. Each community also developed a distinct 
identity; for example, local dyes enabled particular coloring of 
clothing, and house designs reflected local environmental conditions.


Much of India was originally heavily forested. But early Adivasi 
tools did not enable the uprooting of large trees. Most Adivasi 
communities developed a type of farming which many of them 
today call jhum, but what outsiders call swidden agriculture, shifting 
agriculture, or, more negatively, slash-and-burn agriculture. 

Lecture 2—Migration and the Adivasi 
15


This means that a community will cut down and burn off the low 
undergrowth. Using that ash as fertilizer, they plant useful crops in 
among the surviving large trees. When, after a few years, the soil 
there is exhausted, they shift to another region, again cutting and 
burning the undergrowth and farming before having to move on 
again. 


Because Adivasi communities moved so often, most could not 
accumulate much material wealth. As a result, most Adivasi groups 
were not stratified, except by age and gender. 


Elders held, and still hold, great respect. Women and men specialized 
in different, complementary productive activities. Women often 
did more domestic labor like weaving, cooking, and gathering 
forest products, while men often went on extended hunting or 
raiding expeditions, including taking cattle from the surrounding 
communities.

A History of India
16
Other Groups Move In


Over many centuries, other groups migrated into India, settled 
there, and cleared lands that had been forests, reducing the overall 
area available for Adivasis. Many Adivasis and their descendants 
survived by mixing into the surrounding society. 


Often, it was the most able and enterprising young men who left to 
find even low-wage manual labor on nearby or distant farms, or in 
towns and cities as these developed over the last 3,000 years in India. 
But in this process, they left behind much of their separate identity 
and cultural traditions in order to assimilate. 


Adivasi and non-Adivasi men and women intermarried. Most of 
their descendants do not today identify themselves, and are not 
identified by others, as Adivasi, despite their genetic heritage.


The overall trend, however, was for these other cultures to push 
many of the remaining Adivasi communities to the margins, out of 
the most productive agricultural lands, and back into the hills and 
the remaining forests. According to the last official Indian census, 
about 90 percent of Adivasis live in rural areas, often in the most 
rugged and agriculturally unproductive forestland. 


With less land available, the migration cycles of swidden agriculture 
had to be reduced, meaning that the land didn’t have time to 
recover and therefore produced only meager crops. As a result of 
these broad historical forces, Adivasis have long been a particularly 
impoverished population. 


As India’s invaders developed kingdoms or more settled 
communities, their rulers often tried to control the forest dwellers, 
demanding taxes and obedience. When conflict erupted, it was often 
the better armed and more numerous outsiders who drove roads 
through forests, or cut or burned them down, or forced away the 
forest communities into less productive lands. 

Lecture 2—Migration and the Adivasi 
17


Adivasis have also long come under pressure to adopt the religious 
traditions brought to them by outsiders, including Hinduism, 
Christianity, and Islam. 


These broad processes continue down to the present. In India, about 
90 percent of the forests have been cut down or deeply degraded; 
only about 3 percent are virgin forests that were never cleared. Due to 
natural and man-made causes, about 40 percent of India’s total area 
is degraded forest or wasteland, not hospitable for either Adivasis or 
other people. This has put increasing pressure on Adivasis and their 
distinctive way of life. 


Over many decades, the government’s forest department has tried 
to assert its authority over many of the communities still living in 
the forests, including by banning forest fires by Adivasis who were 
practicing their customary jhum. 


But relations between Adivasis and outsiders are not necessarily 
competitive or hostile. Many Adivasi communities have long 
provided forest produce, including plants, animals, wood, and 
handicrafts, to the surrounding farming communities. 
Adivasis and the Government


Both the British colonial government and also the independent 
government of India since 1947 recognized that Adivasis are among 
the least well off of India’s communities. Seeking either to protect 
or advance Adivasi cultures, both governments have implemented 
what have often proven to be conflicting policies and programs. 


One goal has been to preserve Adivasi culture, particularly by 
protecting it against intrusions of outsiders or major changes in 
lifestyle. This has led to efforts designed to isolate Adivasis from 
integration into the surrounding economy and to recognize the 
special status of each individual Adivasi community. 

A History of India
18


On the other hand, a different set of government policies have been 
directed at improving the health, education, quality of life, and 
participation in the larger society by Adivasis, often at the cost of 
losing their distinctive culture and way of life. 
Adivasis Today


Today, about half of all the official Adivasis live in a band stretching 
across the rugged and still somewhat forested lands of central 
India. Adivasi activists here were successful in their demand for 
separate provincial governments, leading to the creation in the year 
2000 of two new provinces: Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, where 
the Adivasi majorities can elect people who look after their special 
interests. 


Most of the other half of India’s Adivasis live in the northeast, 
which is also a mountainous and forested region. Here, the 
distinct identities of various Adivasi communities eventually led 
to the creation of seven provinces. Some Adivasi activists are still 
demanding further separate provinces that recognize and empower 
their individual ethnic group with yet more state governments of 
their own.


Timber, coal, hydroelectric energy, and other valuable resources are 
located in the mountainous or hilly lands where Adivasis have long 
lived. This has meant that outsiders have often exploited or fought 
with them.


Because many Adivasis today live near fast-flowing rivers, they are 
often dislocated by the construction of major dams. Many Adivasi 
and allied outsider human rights advocates have organized protests 
against the displacement of Adivasis by such development projects.


Indeed, many Adivasi regions are today the sites of conflict, even 
violent Maoist-style guerilla revolution against the surrounding 
society and the Indian government. A map of ongoing insurgencies, 

Lecture 2—Migration and the Adivasi 
19
particularly left-wing guerilla conflicts, would feature the same 
areas where Adivasi communities concentrate: the rugged and still 
somewhat forested lands of central India, and India’s mountainous 
and forested northeast.

Lecture 3
Indus Valley Civilization
T
he Indus River civilization, an urban-based society, was as 
technologically developed as any in the entire ancient world 
of its day, roughly 2600 B.C.E to 1900 B.C.E. Indeed, the Indus 
River civilization covered a larger territory than its much more famous 
and roughly contemporary ancient cultures, including those along the 
Nile in Egypt, between the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia, and 
along the Yellow River in China. After 700 years of flourishing, the Indus 
civilization declined and then dissipated. Its people and cultures and 
their descendants evidently spread across the Indian subcontinent, where 
they form major, but often unacknowledged, parts of today’s society. 
The Indus People


The people of the Indus civilization dispersed nearly four thousand 
years ago. They left fascinating but also tantalizingly incomplete 
evidence about themselves and their achievements. 


By around 2600 B.C.E, people living along the lower Indus River in 
western India had already developed extensive and intensive settled 
agriculture along with livestock husbandry. 


These early Indus communities don’t seem to have used swidden 
agriculture, so they weren’t Adivasis. But they may have originally 
developed from once-Adivasi communities who innovated new 
forms of agriculture and pastoralism that set them on the path to a 
more complex and urban-based economy and society. 


The Indus population may also have included immigrants from the 
Iranian plateau, with some who may have come from elsewhere in 

Lecture 3—Indus Valley Civilization 
21
the Persian Gulf region or from Central Asia. The few skeletons that 
have survived suggest a physically diverse population. 


As the economy continued to expand, these cities came together 
into a well-organized, multi-city society. But, after about 700 years, 
this civilization declined and dispersed. For dozens of centuries, 
knowledge of this Indus civilization was lost as its abandoned cities 
decayed into ruins and were buried under yards of wind-blown earth.


Then, starting in the 1920s, British and Indian archaeologists began 
to explore the intriguing mounds of rubble in the lower Indus plain. 
They discovered that beneath the rubble were the buried remnants 
of entire cities. 


By now, several large cities have been largely unearthed. One major 
city, called Dholavira, is now in the Republic of India, along the coast. 
Two other cities, the largest found so far, are now in Pakistan; we call 
them Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. In addition, many other smaller 
towns and other sites have been found throughout the region, which 
extends about a thousand miles up the Indus River plain.

A History of India
22


As archaeologists dug deeper into the ruins, they found what had 
been amazingly organized cities, with surrounding walls, straight 
streets, an extensive system of sanitation, substantial houses, and 
what seem to be large public buildings like assembly halls, grain-
storage warehouses, and bathhouses.


The city walls, like the houses and other buildings, were of fired 
bricks carefully built up high. Unlike cities in other civilizations, 
the walls of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa were evidently not 
designed mainly for defense against major military attacks. But 
these walls would prevent people, especially those laden with grain 
or other goods, from entering or leaving except through the few 
city gateways. In this way, leaders could collect taxes from people 
entering or leaving the city, or at least keep track of them.


Straight main streets show a high level of organization. These cities 
also had elaborate sanitation systems, with large and watertight 
sewage drains leading from toilets and bathing rooms inside houses 
into collective channels beneath the streets leading into soak pits.


In the larger two-story houses that have been excavated, the walls 
facing the street are blank, with relatively narrow doorways leading 
into a separate entryway. This indicates that people wanted a well-
defined private space within. 


While some of the cities have impressive buildings near their center, 
none have the vast palaces or temples that would indicate a powerful 
king or priesthood characteristic of other contemporary civilizations. 
Indus Writing and Artifacts


Archaeologists have found thousands of stone seals with animals 
carved on them, as well as clear writing, which is especially exciting. 
Some scholars have tried to find similarities or common origins 
between the Indus writing system and that of the nearest other 
civilization, the Mesopotamian.

Lecture 3—Indus Valley Civilization 
23


But any apparently similar features might have come instead 
from independent invention, when people from each of the two 
civilizations came up with similar representations for physical 
objects that they saw. Unlike those of the contemporary Egyptian, 
Mesopotamian, and Chinese civilizations, the Indus form of writing 
has not yet been deciphered. 


The many animals on these seals can also provide insights into the 
Indus culture and natural environment. Some of the animals are direct 
representations of actual creatures, including humped bulls, so we can 
assume that these were animals that the Indus people had as livestock. 


Animals like rhinoceros seem to have been very common locally, 
while others, like the elephant, seem to have been famously rare. But 
many images are unrealistic combinations of several natural animals, 
such as a tiger’s stripes on an animal with bull’s horns. 
Mohenjo-daro ruins

A History of India
24


A few highly refined busts 
and other sculptures have 
also been found, including 
that of a man who many 
take to be a confident 
leader, perhaps of Iranian 
or Central Asian ethnic 
origin. Another striking 
object is the thin graceful 
figure of a young woman, 
perhaps in a dancing pose. 
But lacking any indigenous 
explanation or context, we 
can only speculate about 
the intent and purpose of 
these works of art.


Less polished but more frequently found are simpler clay images of 
men and women. Some of these images seem to have features of both 
men and women. They were evidently made in two parts, the upper 
and lower, separately and then joined in the middle. 


Further, there are some models of wheeled carts, evidently pulled 
by domesticated animals. These may have been children’s toys. But 
they suggest the technology used by this civilization, especially for 
moving the large volume of grain from the surrounding villages to 
the city, where it was evidently stored in large granaries. 


A few graveyards have also been discovered. In these graves, men, 
women, and children were carefully interred, often with food and 
some other simple grave goods. This suggests that they were being 
honored, and probably provisioned for an afterlife. 


We can be sure that the Indus people traded up and down the Persian 
Gulf with parts of the Mesopotamian civilization. Burial mounds in 
Bahrain, for example, contain lapis lazuli and other stone artifacts

Lecture 3—Indus Valley Civilization 
25
that can be traced using chemistry to quarries in the mountains 
surrounding the Indus civilization. 
The Decline


It is clear that the Indus cities did not suffer a sudden violent end, 
but rather a gradual decline and emigration of its population, who 
carried their culture with them. One contributing factor seems to 
have been regional climate change. Most of the land where the Indus 
civilization stood is now dry and desiccated, incapable of sustaining 
the high level of agriculture necessary for the urban-based economy 
we know was once there. 


Some of this may have been a natural process. For example, the 
Indus River and its branches have has long since shifted their course 
away from where it was during the period of the Indus culture. 
There is some evidence that a river, sometimes later identified as the 
Ghaggar-Hakra or the Saraswati, silted or dried up. With less access 
to river-based trade, the commercial economy would also decline.


But there may have been more dramatic natural factors as work as 
well. A series of massive floods down the Indus River may have 
disrupted the economy and society, leading to a decline. 


Another possible explanation comes from geological evidence that 
the region where the Indus and other rivers debouched into the sea 
was pushed up by the same forces that moved the entire Indian 
tectonic plate into Asia. This meant that these rivers backed up, first 
flooding the lands upstream and then diverting to another course to 
the sea. 


Other possible contributing causes were human made. A vast 
amount of wood would have been needed to fire the huge number 
of bricks that this culture used to build walls and houses. More wood 
was needed to make artifacts and cook food. 

A History of India
26


It’s possible that the culture itself deforested the surrounding areas, 
reaching out ever farther over time as local forests disappeared but the 
need for wood increased. Such deforestation would have increased 
soil erosion as well as desiccation of the environment, making this a 
possible very early example of a human-made environmental disaster.
Migration Patterns


As the economy evidently declined, the people living in this region 
would have emigrated to more productive lands. Some probably 
migrated southeastward and eastward to regions where their 
farming methods would have thrived. We can use linguistic and 
other cultural evidence to support these broad migration patterns. 


In south India today, there are four major languages (and many 
smaller ones) that are collectively known to linguists as the 
Dravidian language family. These are closely related to each other 
but not to any other known language except one smaller Dravidian 
language, Brahui. That language’s speakers today are located in the 
hilly upland area of today’s Pakistani province of Baluchistan, just 
northwest of where the Indus civilization was based. 


A plausible theory is that most of the Indus people migrated to the 
southeast, but some remained nearby. In this way, the Indus language 
would survive, although linguists have not yet proven this origin. 


Many scholars see likely ancestral connections between the large 
majority of the men and women now living in north India and the 
people who lived in the Indus civilization. Their farming skills and 
knowledge of mathematics and civil engineering would have come 
with them as they migrated eastward. 
Difficulties


As we’ve briefly seen in this lecture, the Indus civilization is 
fascinating yet also frustratingly difficult to understand. We would 

Lecture 3—Indus Valley Civilization 
27
like to do more archaeological excavation. But some of the prime 
areas are in politically troubled parts of Pakistan, where it may be 
dangerous to dig. 


Also, there are towns right on top of some areas, including above 
parts of Indus cities that we already know about. We can’t displace 
those people and tear down their homes and businesses in order to 
dig beneath them. 


Human agricultural irrigation as well as rainfall continue to crumble 
the bricks that remain from some of these cities, making preserving 
what has been unearthed difficult, and exploring further even harder.


Finally, the ancient and remarkable nature of the Indus culture makes 
it a continuing political issue today. It hasn’t received the same 
level of international attention as have its contemporary Egyptian, 
Mesopotamian, and Chinese civilizations, since the connection 
between the ancient Indus people and the current people of Pakistan 
and India today are not as evident.

Indo-European Vedic Culture
T
oday, men and women legally identified as Hindu total about a 
billion people. Hinduism contains a broad range of religious 
traditions with a wide variety of beliefs and practices that 
developed and changed over many centuries. Hindus also include people 
of many different biological ancestries. In order to understand the origins 
of Hinduism, in this lecture we will go back to its ancient foundations. 
Then, we’ll follow the fascinating and complex historical development 
of both the religion and of the communities of diverse people collectively 
known as Hindus. 
The Vedas


This lecture will focus on the people of the Vedas, a body of sacred 
texts whose name means “that which is known.” People have been 
memorizing and reciting these texts virtually unchanged for 3,000 
years. This is the longest continuously used body of sacred texts in 
human history. 


Using the Vedas and other sources, we’ll try to reconstruct the 
history of the clans that collectively identified themselves with the 
Vedas. Through interactions with the other two sources for ancient 
Indian cultures, these people evolved a model for society that spread 
unevenly across the subcontinent. 


In looking closely at the Vedic texts themselves, we should also keep 
in mind that they are still sacred for many believing Hindus today. 
As such, the Vedas as a whole are considered by many in the Hindu 
community to be uncreated truth, the entire universe in the form of 
sound. The collection of texts that comprise the Vedas hold status as 
Sruti, “knowledge from hearing.”

Lecture 4—Indo-European Vedic Culture 
29


For centuries, the Vedas remained an oral tradition. Because of its 
sacredness, these sounds were preserved precisely, with every 
syllable intact. More than a hundred generations of students down 
to the present day have devoted themselves to memorizing and 
internalizing parts of the Vedas. 


Further, today, many Hindus believe passionately that they are the 
people of India, divinely endowed with that land. Likewise, they 
believe the Vedas have eternally been Indian and have preserved 
knowledge of an ancient, ideal Indian society with a morality, 
technology, and other achievements that far surpassed any other 
culture, even those of the 21st century. 


Today, Hindus comprise more than 80 percent of the people in the 
Republic of India. The political party currently in office represents a 
movement dedicated to Hindutva, or “Hindu-ness,” as the essence 
of the Indian nation. The Vedas, from the emic perspective, are thus 
eternally beyond human historical time.


Scholars from outside of the Hindu tradition, and also many within 
it, however, often adopt an etic perspective. This locates the Vedas as 
part of human history and the product of people. 


Etic linguists calculate the speed with which the language of the 
Vedas evolved. Such scholars can give a rough date to each Vedic 
poem, and put each into an historical sequence. Other scholars plot 
geographically the regions and animals mentioned in each Vedic 
text. Most etic scholars assert that the earliest Vedic hymns date 
back to around 1500 B.C.E, while some Vedic texts continued to be 
composed over the following 10-century-long period. 
Collections within the Vedas


Within the Vedas as a whole, there are several major collections. 
The first of these is the Rig Veda, which contains 1,028 poetic hymns 
totaling some 10,600 verses. Each poem addresses and praises one 

A History of India
30
or more divine beings. They are arranged into 10 books, with the 
middle six known as the family books, since each was preserved by 
a particular clan. For etic scholars, these six appear to be the oldest, 
since their language is earliest and the lifestyle they describe is that 
of related clans migrating into northwestern India. 


Later books, composed around 1000 B.C.E according to etic scholars, 
are the products of Vedic clans as they settled in north India and 
traded, contended, and mixed with the other communities already 
living there. 


In addition to the Rig Veda, there are other Vedic collections that 
highlight the rituals of sacrifice to divine beings, provide the 
rhythmic models for recitation of the hymns, and contain charms, 
spells, and medical guidance. 


The Brahmanas are detailed guidebooks for how to properly perform 
the elaborate Vedic rituals or teach other bodies of knowledge, 
including mathematics or astronomy. According to etic scholars, 

Lecture 4—Indo-European Vedic Culture 
31
these seem to date from the period of roughly 1200 to 600 B.C.E, 
overlapping but generally later than the Rig Veda. 


Then, dating from about 900 to 500 B.C.E, there are the Aranyakas 
and Upanishads, which are more philosophic texts concerning the 
largest issues about the nature of existence, including the universe 
and all its components.


Sruti uses an ancient language known as Vedic Sanskrit. Since the 
18th century, etic linguists have identified Vedic Sanskrit as the oldest 
surviving language within the Indo-European language family. It 
likely originated somewhere in west-central Asia and then spread 
outward across Asia and into Europe. 
Clans and Communities


The Vedic texts include much detailed information about the clans 
that composed them as well as the other communities and cultures 
that they encountered. By looking closely at how the composers of 
the Vedic poems describe themselves, we can reconstruct their ways 
of life and beliefs. 


The early Vedic poems largely describe herding clans called jana. 
These clans did not have much internal social differentiation, except 
that elders were honored and men and women tended to contribute 
in different ways to the community. 


Clearly, some members of some clans devoted themselves to reciting 
devotional hymns in order to obtain the favor and gifts of the 
Vedic gods. Most Vedic poems end with a request, like the defeat 
of enemies, sunlight, protection from darkness, rain, fertility of the 
clan’s livestock and its married couples, the strength of a bull, or the 
transforming power of fire.


As the power of these Vedic hymns grew, since they apparently 
produced the desired result, the reciting poets preserved them and 

A History of India
32
passed them on to students. The early Rig Veda thus seems to show 
the specialization of some men or families as priests with expertise in 
rituals. The Vedic deity Varuna was an early model of the moral and 
religious leader among the gods, and perhaps also a model for these 
emerging human priests as well.


Other poems show how these migrating Vedic clans traveled by 
wagons and carts, sometimes drawn by oxen. They evidently had 
goats, donkeys, and dogs, some trained to hunt boar. Cattle were 
especially highly valued. 


The Vedic cultures had also mastered horses. They seem to have 
used these horses to pull three-wheeled chariots, especially when 
charging into battle. The Vedas describe halters and harnesses for 
these chariot horses, but not horseshoes or stirrups or saddles, so 
they may not as often have ridden on horseback.

Some Vedic clans and individuals seem to have specialized in 
protecting the clan and in capturing the cattle and resources of 
others. The model for human warriors was the fierce, black-bearded 
god Indra, the martial leader of all the Vedic divinities. 


The authors of some Rig Vedic hymns call upon Indra to guide them 
to victory against other clans of Arya, meaning “the noble people,” 
which is how the Vedic clans often refer to themselves. This suggests 
intra-clan conflicts, not unusual among people anywhere in the world. 


The Rig Veda also describes Indra as the war leader of the group 
of gods called the Deva, the “shining ones.” In the early Rig Vedic 
hymns, another group of divinities were the Asura, sometimes 
described as the relatives of the Deva, evidently their elder brothers 
or even father. But in the later Rig Vedic hymns, the Asura became 
enemies of the Deva. 


The Asuras eventually became evil demons whom Indra strips 
of their powers and supporters, then defeats. Significantly, this 
apparently shows us the growing human conflict between the 
Indo-European clans that migrated into India and those clans that 
migrated into Iran. 


As the Zoroastrian religion developed in Iran, its divinities were 
called the Ahura, while the demons were called the Daeva. Thus, as 
these two cultures separated and conflicted, their religious traditions 
did as well. Vedic gods, Devas, became Iranian demons and Iranian 
gods became Vedic demons, Asuras. As one Rig Vedic poem states, 
“From the high plain they went apart in opposite directions.” 
Later Society


The later Vedic poems indicate that, as the society settled and 
developed trade, it was becoming more complex. These poems 
describe peaceful villages, surrounded by fields, soothed by the 
lowing of well-fed domesticated cattle.

A History of India
34


Some Vedic poems mention musical instruments, including flutes, 
lutes, harps, and drums. The poems also describe people’s problems: 
One poem is an evocative lament by a man addicted to gambling 
with dice, while in several hymns a woman laments being a co-wife, 
living in rivalry with other wives and striving to hold the affections 
of their shared husband. 


Ideas emerged that would remain strong currents in later Indian 
society. Generally, women seem to have been able to marry into 
a higher social class, a process known to etic anthropologists as 
hypergamy. In Vedic poems, when mortal women married divine 
males, these hypergamous marriages customarily succeeded. But 
when goddesses or other divine females married mortal men, the 
wife often became dissatisfied and left her human husband behind. 


Both linguistic and genetic evidence indicates that the main 
settlement area of the Vedic communities was across north India, 
especially in the Ganges plain. Over the centuries, they settled in 
different ecological niches and developed their own distinct cultures, 
including cuisine and language. The major languages in northern 
India are all daughter tongues of Sanskrit. But the people who speak 
these distinct, regionally based languages, and their thousands of 
local dialects, seem mostly to be biological descendants of all three 
sources: Vedic, Indus, and Adivasi.


In contrast, the four major languages of South India are not part of 
the Indo-European language family, and thus are not derived from 
Sanskrit. This suggests that the descendants of Vedic communities 
did not migrate as much into that region. And those who did either 
remained a small but distinctive minority, often preserving Sanskrit, 
or else merged into the local communities.

Lecture 5
Caste: Varna and Jati
T
he caste system is probably the most distinctive feature of Indian 
society. Outsiders have understood it in their own ways, and 
Indian traditionalists and reformers have continually debated 
the inequalities it represents. So, the various beliefs and practices now 
associated with the term caste have long and complex histories. We 
should consider some of the earliest models from ancient Indian society 
that may reveal some of the origins of what twenty centuries later was 
called the caste system by Europeans. 
Caste


The word caste, or casta, is Portuguese. When Vasco da Gama 
discovered how to sail from Europe around southern Africa and 
reached India in 1498, he tried to understand Indian society in his 
own terms. Vasco da Gama and his Portuguese successors tried 
to describe the many hierarchically ranked social groups they 
encountered when they entered India’s ports. 


The Portuguese term casta means “breed,” as in a breed of horses or 
a breed of cattle. While this term stuck as caste, and is still widely in 
use today, it did not accurately describe either Indian social models 
or actual social practice. 


In order to see the emic origins of this model—that is, the earliest 
Indian explanations of its origins—we should turn to a close reading 
of the one sacred Vedic hymn that explains the creation of the four 
orders of human beings, as part of the origin of the cosmos. 


As analyzed by etic scholars, the earliest of the Vedas revealed clans 
who were herders with little internal social differentiation. Some 

Lecture 5—Caste: Varna and Jati 
37
individuals and families seem to have specialized in preserving and 
reciting the cosmic knowledge contained in the Vedic hymns and in 
performing the rituals that gained the favor and gifts from the gods. 
Over time, these Vedic ritual specialists claimed more power for 
themselves. 


The concept of the sacrifice stood central to the creation of the 
universe, including the creation of human beings. Since these priests 
possessed the Veda and performed sacrifices, when we look at Vedic 
poems we are usually seeing things from the priests’ perspective. 


One late Rig Vedic hymn, the often-cited book 10, hymn 90, proclaims 
how the gods themselves served as priests in the primal sacrifice that 
created the entire universe. This text describes a cosmic man, whom 
the gods sacrificed. During the sacrifice, everything in the universe 
emerged: the Veda, the seasons, all animals, and humans as well. 


This hymn then goes on to describe how the respective parts of the 
cosmic man—his mouth, arms, thighs, and feet—each became an 
order of humans.


Created from his mouth were Brahmins, the ritual specialists 
who spoke the Veda and ritually consumed the food that fed the 
gods and ancestors. 


From the arms of the cosmic man came the rulers known as the 
Rajya and later Kshatriya. 


From the thighs of the Cosmic Man came the rest of the Vedic 
people, the Vaishya. 


From his feet came the Shudra, who were to serve the other 
orders. 


This one late Vedic hymn thus evidently shows how an emerging 
social order, the Brahmins, perceived the origins of humans in a way 
that legitimated their own status at the highest level. 


Since all people classed as human came from the same cosmic man, 
all are parts of the same entity. Nevertheless, the hymn shows a 

A History of India
38
ranking of the four social orders, later known as varna, literally 
meaning “ritual color.” Brahmins were associated with white, 
Kshatriyas with red, Vaishyas with green, and Shudra with blue or 
blue-black. 


The top three varnas would contain only about 20 percent of the 
population. In contrast, people classed as Shudras comprised more 
than half of the population. The remaining quarter of the population 
did not have a varna. Hence, they were often throughout history 
called the fifth order, or outcastes, or untouchables. This non-varna 
group also included most Adivasis. 
The Jatis


During the same late Vedic period that Brahmins were 
conceptualizing varnas, social and cultural forces were also creating 
more localized social groups, known as jati. The core concept of a jati 
was that people were born into this social group with an inherited, 
specific dharma, meaning “code for conduct.” Broadly, this birth 
group could be any social category—for example, women and men 
are spoken of as separate jatis. 

Lecture 5—Caste: Varna and Jati 
39


The most widespread use of the term jati referred to people with 
the same traditional occupation, like weavers, goldsmiths, herders, 
warriors, or professional priests. 


Compared to the system of varna, where the groups were huge in 
number, the system of jatis was more relevant to everyday life. Not 
all members of a jati, however, actually earned their living from that 
traditional occupation. 


Marriages generally took place within jatis. Each jati had a specific 
diet, sometimes vegetarian or with a restriction on consumable 
meats. On ritual occasions, the members of a jati would openly dine 
together, signifying their shared identity. 


Anthropologists today identify between 10,000 and 20,000 jatis 
(depending on how these jatis are defined). While the current median 
size of a jati is between 5,000 and 15,000 people, they range in size 
from a few hundred to millions.
The Brahmins


While Brahmins were all part of one varna, they also diverged into 
different ways of life, which became distinct jatis. Brahmins who 
were less engaged in the world tended to rank higher in ritual terms. 


Some Brahmins were especially revered. Receiving gifts of land, 
cattle, and other wealth from respectful rulers and merchants, 
these Brahmins could devote themselves to reciting the Veda and 
performing its ritual sacrifices within their homes. 


Other Brahmins withdrew from society in order to pursue higher 
forms of spiritual and mystical knowledge. Some of these took on 
ascetic practices to control their desires and liberate themselves from 
their physical bodies and from the material world. 

A History of India
40


Some late Vedic hymns celebrate those long-haired ascetics who 
relinquished society and wandered homelessly, without desire, 
seeking unity with the divine. The Aranyakas and Upanishads—the 
“forest” and “esoteric” books, respectively—emerged largely from 
this path, as thinkers and philosophers considered the nature of the 
self, Atman, and its relationship to the universe as a whole, called 
Brahman. They are part of Vedanta, or “the end or goal of the Veda.” 


Yet other Brahmins worked as professional priests, performing 
Vedic ritual sacrifices for patrons. The late Vedas show numerous 
specialties emerging among priests, some pouring the sacrifice into 
the fire, others as expert chanters of the Veda, and still others as the 
supervising conductor of the ritual. Professional priests necessarily 
were obliged to serve others in society, including many non-Brahmins. 
The Kshatriyas


As with the Brahmins, many different jatis developed among the 
Kshatriyas. These jatis were often called Rajputs, literally meaning 
the “sons of kings or princes.” Such warrior clans led their followers, 
or jana, to occupy and control territories.


In the early Vedic period, some men rose to become war leaders, but 
did not actually rule. In the late Vedic period, hereditary rajas, or kings, 
gradually emerged as rulers of distinct kingdoms known as janapada. 


Late Vedic hymns describe a royal consecration rite, or rajasuya. 
Among the grandest such rites was the Ashvamedha, in which 
Brahmin priests sanctified a special horse to represent the king. Then, 
the horse was let loose to roam symbolically throughout the universe. 


In mundane terms, the horse was physically directed to move only 
through that raja’s own kingdom, or, more ambitiously, to enter 
a neighboring kingdom. Should that neighboring raja oppose the 
passage of the sacred horse, their armies would clash. If defeated, 
the neighboring raja would have to accept subordinate status to the 

Lecture 5—Caste: Varna and Jati 
41
conquering king. At the end of a year, the horse returned to his king’s 
capital, so that its sacred power could be ritually transferred to him. 


When we look at textual and linguistic evidence from the late Vedic 
period, the centuries before and after 500 B.C.E, we can count up 
600–700 janapadas across north India, centering on the Gangetic 
plain but extending beyond that as well.
Networks


Over time, a network of towns and one or more cities developed. 
Communities began to develop a relationship to that particular 
place. Each place contained a particular mix of varnas and jatis. 
Each developed its own cultural identity, with a language or dialect 
distinguishing its inhabitants from those of the neighboring janapadas. 


Political and commercial links within each janapada were also strong. 
Some janapadas evidently had a more powerful ruling raja, who had 
territorial authority. Others were led by a council of men representing 
the leading clans within that kingdom, with the raja as the chairman.


The development of the economy also strengthened mercantile 
groups. Trade often extended beyond the kingdom’s boundaries. 
We begin to see money in the form of actual silver or copper coins 
appearing from about the 6th century B.C.E. Such an even partially 
monetized economy enabled commerce to flourish as never before. 


To manage particular kinds of production and commerce, merchants 
developed shrini, or trade guilds. These seem to have coordinated the 
prices charged and paid by its members, leading to their cooperation 
rather than competition.


To carry grain, hand-manufactured products, and other goods, jatis 
of transporters and mobile traders emerged. Often such transporters 
loaded their cargo on the backs of bullocks and other cattle, which 
meant that they were not dependent on smooth roads as carts or 

A History of India
42
wagons would be. Given the torrential monsoon rains that bring 
floods every year, maintaining roads has always been a major issue 
in India. Furthermore, many rulers did not see long-distance road 
building and repair as part of their obligation.


Many people were not systematically integrated into the economy. 
There were still many Adivasi living in the forests, who rarely paid 
taxes and periodically emerged to raid, as well as trade with, the 
settled farmers nearby. 


Sometimes these Adivasi groups became associated or integrated 
with the surrounding society of settled agriculturalists. They then 
functioned as low-ranked jatis.


As various janapadas developed into kingdoms, especially in north 
India, they produced accounts of fabled warriors and kings. Starting 
around the 5th century B.C.E, these accounts were gradually collected 
into extended epics by bards, who were often Brahmin courtiers.

Lecture 6
Epic Literature: Ramayana
T
he epic poem Ramayana recounts the life of Rama, the perfect 
prince, and his efforts to liberate his faithful wife, Sita, from her 
demon abductor. In this lecture, we’ll start with an examination of 
the Ramayana as the premier example of Kavya, a leading Sanskrit poetic 
genre. We’ll note its differences and similarities with classical Greek and 
Latin epics and also today’s ideas about history writing. As we briefly 
recount the narrative of the life of Rama, we’ll discuss what we, as etic 
historians, can learn about the political, social, and cultural world the 
Ramayana describes. We’ll end by looking at how people have used the 
Ramayana over time.
Western Comparisons


In its genre and scope, the Ramayana is often compared by Western 
readers with Homer’s Odyssey and Virgil’s Aeneid. Each is a work of 
literature, but each also conveys the history of a divinely descended 
man. Homer’s Odysseus has as an ancestor the Greek messenger 
god, Hermes. Aeneas, Virgil tells us, is the son of the Roman goddess 
Venus. And Rama, according to many tellers of his life, is an avatara, 
or birth on earth in human form, of the god Vishnu. Each of these 
massive poems also tells us much about their authors’ respective 
cultural and social worlds, although in differing ways.


One repeated criticism by outsiders has been that, unlike that of the 
West, Indian history writing does not have real biographies. But the 
Ramayana is the life story of Rama. In emic terms, Rama is the god 
Vishnu born on earth, but he is still born as a human, with human 
limitations and a life story. Further, one main purpose of Rama’s 
birth and of the Ramayana itself is to teach moral behavior, or 
dharma, to people. 

A History of India
44


Many Western biographers also use their subject’s life to teach moral 
lessons, and many people read them in order to find role models to 
emulate, or avoid. In this sense, the life story of Rama compares to 
the genre of biography. 


The setting of the Ramayana includes some very real places and 
social formations. Recall that from about the 6th century B.C.E 
onward, especially in the north Indian Gangetic plain, hundreds 
of locally based janapadas, or “people’s places,” were developing 
into small kingdoms. One of these kingdoms was Koshala, with its 
capital of Ayodhya, where the Ramayana begins and ends.


The Ramayana is mainly an elite text, primarily focused on rajas, 
their extended families, and their supporters, servants, and enemies, 
demonic and human.
Authorship


Emic and etic ideas about 
the complex authorship 
of the Ramayana differ 
in significant ways. A 
leading emic view credits 
the sage Valmiki with 
composing 
the 
most 
authoritative, 
original 
Sanskrit telling of the 
Ramayana. Valmiki was 
a reformed bandit who 
had achieved great merit 
through 
becoming 
a 
forest-dwelling 
ascetic. 
He gives Raja and Sita 
shelter near the beginning 
and end of the Ramayana, 
but is otherwise not very

45
involved in the story. Instead, as the Ramayana explains, Valmiki hears 
Rama’s whole story from the demigod Narada and then is ordered by 
the creator god Brahma to retell it. 


The emic tradition credits Valmiki with inventing the specific 
32-syllable poetic meter, called a shloka, in which the Ramayana and 
various other classical Sanskrit poems were recited. 


In etic terms, Valmiki could not have been the sole author of the 
Ramayana, given its sheer volume and many centuries of composition. 
In the current form of the Sanskrit Ramayana attributed to Valmiki, 
the Ramayana is 50,000 lines long, which is double Homer’s Odyssey 
and Virgil’s Aeneid combined. Further, linguists and historians of 
religion analyze the text as the product of about 900 years of adding 
to, altering, and editing by many sequential authors—each of whom, 
however, gave Valmiki credit for the entire text.
Rama’s Life


Before Rama’s birth, King Dasaratha rules the north Indian kingdom 
of Ayodhya. While both etic and emic scholars agree that this was 
a real place, the center for an expansive janapada, there is no etic 
evidence for this particular king. 


Brahmin priests perform a great sacrifice, producing four male heirs 
from three mothers for Dasaratha. The god Vishnu comes to earth 
as the four male heirs, but mostly as Rama. He does this to fight the 
demon king Ravana, who can’t be harmed by gods or other demons, 
but can fall to a human.


Sita, the embodiment of the goddess Lakshmi—that is, Vishnu’s 
wife—is voluntarily born on earth in order to be Rama’s bride.


Eventually, King Dasaratha decides to abdicate and crown Rama 
as the new king. But political machinations lead to Rama’s exile to 
the woods and the crowning of his brother Bharata. Bharata rules in 

A History of India
46
Rama’s name, refusing to accept the throne. Rama’s wife Sita joins 
him in the woods.


The pivotal point in the Ramayana comes when Ravana carries off 
Sita. Ravana does this out of his lascivious lust for her and also to get 
revenge for his mutilated sister, Surpanakha. The demons generally 
all act with excessive desire. While that is their dharma, they also 
receive punishments for acting on it.


In order to perform his dharma by recovering Sita, Rama recruits 
the local population of monkeys and bears as his allies. Most notable 
among these is Hanuman, a divinely descended monkey who becomes 
Rama’s leading servant and a very popular deity in his own right. 


In the great war between Rama’s forces and Ravana’s demon armies, 
many battles and perils are detailed, each with a moral lesson 
attached. For instance, at one point Rama’s brother Lakshmana 
is gravely wounded and about to be carried off by the exultant 
demons. But Lakshmana remembers that he is Vishnu incarnate and 
therefore invulnerable. At the same time, however, Lakshmana must 
be human or he cannot aid in the killing of Ravana.


To revive Lakshmana, Hanuman is sent off to a distant mountain to 
bring back a special healing herb. On his arrival there, he realizes 
he isn’t educated enough to identify the needed medical plant. He 
cleverly brings back the entire mountain, enabling the physicians 
at Lakshmana’s side to select the herb and cure him. This emically 
shows how even uneducated servants can cleverly use their brute 
strength in devoted service of their elite masters.


With Hanuman’s help, Rama tracks down and kills Ravana, 
then liberates Sita. When she rushes to rejoin Rama, however, he 
repudiates her as having become impure by living under Ravana’s 
power. For some emic commentators, this shows that Rama has 
acted only out of moral duty, not his personal desire for Sita. Other 
analysts in India and the West critique Rama for blaming the victim, 

Lecture 6—Epic Literature: Ramayana 
47
Hanuman

A History of India
48
Sita, for her unwilling abduction—just as so many abducted women 
have been blamed by their family and by society in so many cultures. 


Valmiki has Sita then enter a sacred fire to prove her purity to the 
world. Only then does Rama accept her back. To explain his action, 
Rama proclaims that he knew she was pure all along, but since 
less enlightened people might not understand that, he had her 
demonstrate her purity to them by this fiery test.


After the return of Rama and Sita to Ayodhya, they rule as king and 
queen completely virtuously. But, once again, the unenlightened 
subjects of Ayodhya misperceive dharma and begin ignorantly 
questioning Sita’s virtue. 


Rama feels he must send Sita away, banishing her to Valmiki’s 
hermitage, unaware that she is pregnant with his twin sons. As 
youths, those sons come to Rama’s court and recite the Ramayana, 
which Valmiki has taught them. Then, Sita returns to her divine 
form as Lakshmi. Finally, Rama too ends his earthly life and again 
becomes the god Vishnu. 
Interpretations


In etic terms, Rama may have been a real prince, or several princes, 
whom local people deified. In emic terms, Rama is a beloved deity to 
whom people can relate, often more accessibly revered than the more 
distant Vishnu.


As filled as the Ramayana is with moral lessons, branch stories, and 
numerous episodes, it is also a biography of Rama. To many Hindus 
today, every word of Valmiki’s telling of it is absolute truth. But for 
many others, Hindus and non-Hindus, the story of Rama could be 
used for other purposes. 


After Valmiki, many other authors retold the story of Rama in slightly 
or greatly different ways. Each of these later authors, using his or 

Lecture 6—Epic Literature: Ramayana 
49
her own language, highlights different features of Rama’s story. The 
16th-century Mughal emperor Akbar his Muslim officials supervise 
the translation of the Ramayana into the Persian language of his 
imperial court, as a major work of both history and moral teaching. 


Many devotional films for the popular Bollywood and various 
Indian regional cinemas have used parts of the Ramayana as their 
plot. In recent years, various television producers have used that 
medium to present the story of Rama.


There have also been many translations and retellings in English, 
most recently from Valmiki’s Sanskrit telling, under the general 
editorship of American scholars Robert and Sally Goldman.


But critics of the Brahmanic system of Varnas and dharma have also 
used the story of Rama to prove a very different history. For example, 
there is a substantial jati, or birth group, that proudly calls itself the 
descendants and followers of Valmiki, although elite Hindus used 
to class them as “untouchable” before untouchability became illegal 
in today’s India. So various communities have challenged their 
low status in the Brahmanic system by using the prestige of the 
Ramayana.


Over the last few centuries, many fiction writers have also used 
episodes or characters from the Ramayana to convey a variety of 
messages that clash with those of Valmiki’s telling. Feminist short 
story authors and playwrights celebrate Sita, often portraying her as 
a strong, independent woman wronged by an insensitive husband. 


Some social reformers have critiqued orthodox tellings of the 
life of Rama, claiming those elite authors justify his abuses of his 
lower-class and lower-Varna subjects. Most prominently, a cultural 
nationalist movement in the Tamil-speaking region of south India, 
called the Dravidian movement, started in the 1930s to attack 
Brahmin domination. 

A History of India
50


Although Brahmins were a small minority in the Tamil region, they 
controlled much of the political and economic power there. Under 
the charismatic Erode Venkata Ramasamy, known as E. V. R., this 
movement pronounced the Ramayana to be the history of an unjust 
invasion by north Indians. 


E. V. R. mounted massive public processions in which images of 
Rama were beaten with defiling shoes and pictures of him. Out of 
this Tamil cultural movement came the political parties that have 
dominated the government in the region for many decades.

Lecture 7
Epic History: Mahabharata
I
n this lecture on the epic Mahabharata, we’ll see how Hindus 
developed a new genre that was explicitly history writing, called in 
Sanskrit Itihasa. That term literally means, “thus it happened.” This 
type of work involves a sequential narration of past events mostly on 
earth, mostly carried out by human beings on a relatively realistic scale. 
However, there are no consistent dates given, key episodes take place in 
heaven, and divine figures occasionally intervene. We’ll start this lecture 
by looking at the sources and nature of the Mahabharata. Then we’ll 
survey its main plot, discussing as we go what this text has meant from 
emic as well as etic perspectives on ancient Indian history.
Mahabharata Overview


The Mahabharata stands as the longest major text in human history, 
containing about 1.8 million words. The Mahabharata is also one of 
the world’s most complex texts in terms of its multiple origins and 
multilayered structure. Many branch stories, frame stories, side 
stories, and asides interweave diverse material around an already 
complex central plot, currently arranged into 18 major books, 100 
minor books, and an appendix.	


The Mahabharata has a complex authorship. Vyasa is the emically 
credited author, although he dictated so fast that only the elephant-
headed Hindu god Ganesha could write fast enough and long 
enough to take it all down. 


In addition, Vyasa is also a significant figure in the plot, being the 
biological grandfather of the two sets of royal cousins who battle 
each other as the central theme in the narrative. But Vyasa is not 
actually present or an eyewitness to many of the events he narrates; 

A History of India
52
in emic terms, he instead relies on divine inspiration and cosmic 
insight. 


In etic terms, the Mahabharata was probably compiled from many 
sources, including folk tales and regional religious traditions, and by 
many authors from the 6th century B.C.E. to the 4th or 5th century C.E. 


The Mahabharata describes a north Indian social, cultural, and 
political world similar to that in its contemporary text, the Ramayana. 
Both texts have as their central figures Kshatriyas, who try to follow 
that caste or Varna’s martial dharma. 


The leading figure in the Ramayana acts flawlessly. In contrast, none 
of the main figures in the Mahabharata acts perfectly; all occasionally 
deviate from their dharma, especially in politics or the heat of battle. 
This makes the Mahabharata more complicated, and also more 
human.


For military historians, the epic’s combat details provide rich 
evidence about warfare in ancient India. Further, for the main 
intended audience of Kshatriyas, the detailed martial accounts that 
stand at the core of the Mahabharata were endlessly captivating.


The political world of the Mahabharata is that of many rival, 
regionally based Hindu kingdoms. Each was constantly striving to 
survive or expand by building a loose coalition through marriage 
and other political alliances. Fighting and political intrigue could be 
very fierce and bloody. 
King Shantanu


We can greatly simplify the Mahabharata’s plot by starting with one 
of its most prominent members, the virtuous and powerful King 
Shantanu. He ruled over Hastinapura on the upper Ganges River. 
Although we don’t yet have any etic evidence about King Shantanu 

Lecture 7—Epic History: Mahabharata 
53
himself, we know that Hastinapura was one of many hundreds of 
rival janapadas. 


As the Mahabharata explains, the man who becomes King Shantanu 
has, in a previous life, been so virtuous that he reached heaven. But 
on his arrival there he was attracted to a bevy of beautiful goddesses, 
in particular the goddess of the Ganges River. When a puff of wind 
blew up the skirt of her sari, he stared at her legs, thus gaining 
demerits for improper desire. 


His act condemned him to be immediately reborn on earth as King 
Shantanu. But before leaving heaven he begged the Ganges River 
goddess to voluntarily take birth in the world as his queen. She 
graciously agreed on the condition that he never question anything 
she did, or else she would abandon him. 


The Ganges River goddess bears King Shantanu’s seven healthy sons, 
but she drowns each at birth. Every time, King Shantanu restrains 
himself from questioning her. But on the birth of their eighth son, he 
can no longer restrain himself and protests this infanticide. He thus 
breaks their prenuptial agreement. 


Before she departs for heaven, she explains that the dead sons were 
gods cursed for a minor fault to live in the world but who begged 
her to kill them at birth before they could commit any bad karma on 
earth. She also allows the last-born boy to survive. This surviving 
son, who is thus also a god incarnated on earth, grows up as a model 
prince and dutiful son. 


Shantanu’s surviving son arranges the remarriage of his father. King 
Shantanu has fallen in love with a lowly but young and beautiful 
fisherwoman, Satyavati. To persuade the bride’s parents to agree to 
this extremely unequal marriage, the son makes a tremendous vow 
that he will cede the throne to the fisherwoman’s sons and himself 
never have any children who might rival his half-brothers. 

A History of India
54


In thus giving up his own royal inheritance and his sexuality, he 
receives the name Bhishma, meaning, “the awesome vowing one.” 
In due time, Bhishma becomes the clan elder. But King Shantanu ’s 
biological dynasty soon gets challengingly twisted. Indeed, one of 
the leading Euro-American translators of the Mahabharata, the late 
J. A. B. van Buitenen, argued that Brahmin genealogists composed 
the most complex inheritance line possible as a series of perplexing 
puzzles for one another.


The fisherwoman has two unhealthy sons with Shantanu. But the 
elder dies childless. The younger is too feeble to win a royal bride 
for himself, so Bhisma now has to enter a bridal contest for his 
inadequate half-brother. 


In a contest among princes, Bhisma wins three royal sisters: Amba, 
Ambika, and Ambalika. The first, Amba, already has an intended 
groom and begs release from Bhisma. He graciously lets her go. 
But Amba’s would-be spouse feels slighted and rejects her. She 
then vows revenge on Bhisma, cremating herself in order to acquire 
enough merit to achieve this in her next life. Indeed, she is reborn as 
the person who will later cause Bhisma’s lingering death.


Bhisma gives the other two royal sisters he’s won to his half-brother, 
who dies of exhaustion while unsuccessfully trying to impregnate 
them both. This leaves King Shantanu’s throne vacant. 


His fisherwoman-queen remembers an incident from her girlhood, 
when she bore a premarital son with a Brahmin sage. This son 
is Vyasa, the emic author of the entire Mahabharata. Vyasa is 
summoned to impregnate the widowed daughters-in-law of the 
fisherwoman, but succeeds in only producing the blind Dhritarashtra 
and the diseased Pandu. Neither is deemed fit to serve as king. A 
third attempt by Vyasa produces the perfect Vidura—but his mother 
is a maidservant, and so he cannot be king.

Lecture 7—Epic History: Mahabharata 
55


The younger, pale prince, Pandu, eventually marries a senior wife, 
Kunti, and also a junior wife. But, while hunting in the forest, he 
fatally shoots a stag while it is in union with a doe. The stag is really 
a human hermit in disguise, who with his dying breath curses Pandu 
to die the first time he has sexual intercourse, meaning Pandu can 
have no biological sons. 


This would have terminated his branch of the descent line. But 
Pandu’s senior wife, Kunti, remembers that she had earned a boon 
from the gods during her youth. This enabled her to call down any 
god and have a son by him. She uses this to produce five brothers, 
known collectively as the Pandavas. They form one royal faction 
that claims the throne, although their connection to King Shantanu 
is quite indirect. 


When Pandu succumbs to desire for his junior wife, he dies, as the 
curse on him promised. So his half-brother, the blind Dhritarashtra, 
governs as regent until the succession is resolved. Dhritarashtra’s 
100 sons, known collectively as the Kauravas, also claim the royal 
inheritance. But, since their father was disqualified for kingship, 
their claim must jump a generation, and is even weaker than that of 
their cousins, the Pandavas.


The Pandavas eventually built a new capital city, named Indraprastha. 
Having built the new Pandava capital, the senior brother, Yudhishtira, 
performs the great coronation sacrifice. The ritual requirements for 
this ritual include a dicing match. Conventionally, the new ruler 
always wins this match to prove his good karma. 


But in the Mahabharata, Yudhishtira loses not just once but multiple 
times to the Kauravas. The end result is 12 years of exile and a 13th year 
in disguise. Should the Pandavas be identified during that thirteenth 
year, they will have to accept yet another twelve years of exile.


The Mahabharata details the many adventures of the Pandavas in 
exile and during their year-long incognito. When they successfully 

A History of India
56
pay off this gambling debt, they return to face their cousins. Each 
side lines up allies, and the armies confront each other. Even the 
crows and jackals flock to feast from the inevitable heaps of corpses. 


Just at that apex moment, the two impatient and bloodthirsty armies 
pause while the Pandava brother Arjuna engages in philosophical 
dialogue with Prince Krishna, who is his chariot driver, cousin, and 
brother-in-law. This dialogue became known as the Bhagavad Gita.


To conclude the great war of the Mahabharata, the Kaurava army 
has so many dignitaries that they decide to have each one be the 
sole commander-in-chief in sequence. First, Bhisma takes command. 
Wherever he leads, the Pandavas are vanquished. The Pandavas ask 
him directly how he can be killed. 


He replies that he would never fight against a woman or someone 
born as a woman. Arjuna hides behind Princess Amba, who has 
vowed revenge on Bhisma, been reborn as a woman, but then traded 
her gender for that of a man. In battle, Arjuna shoots from behind her, 
now him, and mortally wounds Bhisma. This violates the dharma of 
a warrior, but the Pandavas argue that it was necessary to win.


Next, the Brahmin teacher Drona takes command of the Kaurava 
forces. He too vanquishes all the Pandavas he faces. So, the Pandavas 
name an elephant Ashvatthaman, after Drona’s son, and execute it. 
Yudhishtira then lies that Drona’s son had been killed. Since Drona 
had only involved himself with the princes for his son’s sake, Drona 
stops fighting and dies. Yudhishtira has betrayed his own father, the 
god of dharma, but it was necessary to win.


Finally, Karna takes charge of the Kaurava forces. Even when his 
birth mother, Kunti, begs him to reveal that he is the eldest of the 
Pandavas, he refuses to betray his adoptive parents and his Kaurava 
allies. (Kunti had Karna with the sun god but gave him up out of 
embarrassment over premarital pregnancy.)

When Arjuna’s father, Indra, tries to trick Karna out of his armor of

Karna in the back during a time of truce, again a violation of the 
Kshatriya dharma. 


While the Pandavas win the 18-day-long battle, much evil has been 
done. Almost all the prominent figures die, and few of their children 
survive. As a result, this battle marks the beginning of the fourth, 
last, and worst age of the Hindu universe, called the Kali Yuga, in 
which we live today. This conclusion of the epic struggle between 
these rival Kshatriya cousins thus powerfully proclaims not martial 
glory but rather the disorder and immorality brought on by war.

Lecture 8
Dharma in the Bhagavad Gita
T
he Bhagavad Gita, or “Lord God’s Song,” stands as the Hindu 
religious and philosophical text that has long held the widest 
attention in the West. It also continues to have major significance 
within India. Indeed, so sophisticated are the teachings by the divine 
Krishna in the Gita that leaders across the political spectrum have cited 
and relied upon it. This text deserves our close attention so that we can 
begin to understand its broad significance in Indian and world history. In 
this lecture, we’ll explore the emic and etic origins of the Bhagavad Gita, 
its complex, multilayered message, and why it has been used so widely 
and diversely for so long. 
Overview of the Bhagavad Gita


During the last lecture, we saw that the Mahabharata culminates in 
a disastrously destructive 18-day melee between two sets of royal 
cousins fighting for the throne of their north Indian kingdom. On 
the eve of that battle, Arjuna, the best warrior on the Pandava side, 
despairs at the inevitable carnage, throws down his bow, and decides 
to surrender to his cousins rather than seek to slaughter them. 


Arjuna’s cousin, brother-in-law, and charioteer, Prince Krishna, 
drives Arjuna into the no-man’s-land between the impassioned, 
bloodthirsty armies. There, Krishna answers Arjuna’s existential 
doubts by elucidating the nature of the cosmos, the ideal paths for 
humans, and their relationship to the divine.


The Bhagavad Gita is only 700 poetic verses long, taking about 90 
minutes to recite in Sanskrit. In contrast, the Mahabharata as a whole 
contains some 100,000 couplets. However, in emic terms, the Gita 
stands at the emotional peak of the Mahabharata. It is god revealing 

A History of India
60
himself and his message to Arjuna at the center of the battlefield and 
to humanity as a whole. 


Many etic scholars regard the Mahabharata as a whole as having 
been composed by multiple authors over roughly nine centuries 
from the late Vedic period onward, with the final versions fully 
compiled only by the 4th or 5th century C.E. Different authors must 
have contributed different sections or versions of the text, inserting 
new episodes and editing or deleting others. 
Medium Changes


In both religious and in technical terms, the structure of Indian 
narratives like the Mahabharata during that period made such 
insertions, amendments, and deletions relatively easy. In addition, 
over the centuries that the Mahabharata remained an oral tradition, 
it was rarely recited as a whole because of its size. 


Even after the Mahabharata was written down, it could be physically 
altered relatively easily. Keep in mind that Indian culture did not use 
paper until many centuries later. Instead, the traditional mode of 
writing was using a pointed stylus to inscribe letters on palm leaves 
or bark that had been flattened, cut into extended rectangles, and 
polished smooth. 


Since each copy of each palm-leaf manuscript was handwritten, even 
the best scribe made inadvertent errors. Any scribe could alter the 
text to conform to what the scribe believed should be there, even if it 
was not in the text being copied. 


Beyond that, palm leaves are themselves inherently physically 
fragile. Corners and edges easily break off, leaving gaps in the 
text. This impermanence of the medium was made worse by the 
alternating dryness and dampness of India’s environment, which 
rapidly decayed all such organic matter. 

Lecture 8—Dharma in the Bhagavad Gita 
61


Scribes had to frequently recopy texts even as the older ones 
molded or rotted and became illegible. This frequent recopying 
again introduced unintentional and also intentional changes in 
each copy, while the original text soon became unusable. Within a 
generation or two, many different copies existed, with no original 
to check them against.


Each episode of the Mahabharata worked best if it was only one leaf 
long, so episodes might be edited to fit that physical length. At 1.8 
million words, the Mahabharata must have required an enormous 
number of leaves. To keep these leaves in sequence, holes were 
inserted for string to tie them together. More holes meant more 
Statue of Prabhupada

A History of India
62
cracks and more lost fragments. Strings eventually broke, leaving a 
pile of disordered leaves. 


All this means that the Gita could very well have been added quite 
late in the compilation of the Mahabharata. This would explain the 
sudden prominence of Krishna and his innovative message, which 
was so different in tone from the rest of the text. Additionally, the 
Gita also displayed later philosophical developments, ones that 
many Hindu thinkers continued to draw upon. 


Many people have come to treat the Gita as a freestanding text, 
quite apart from the rest of the Mahabharata. For example, the most 
scholarly translation, by J. A. B. van Buitenen, was published as a 
separate volume in 1981 by the University of Chicago Press. 


The most popular devotional translation was made in 1968 by Swami 
Prabhupada. Over 23 million copies of his English version alone were 
distributed by his International Society for Krishna Consciousness, 
perhaps better known as the Hare Krishna Movement. 
Krishna’s Teachings


Now we’ll look at what Krishna teaches in the Bhagavad Gita. Facing 
the impending carnage of battle, Arjuna questions the purpose of 
life, specifically his obligation to kill his elders, cousins, and teachers. 
How can that killing be psychologically or morally justified under 
any circumstances? 


To this very human dilemma, Krishna provides multiple and 
multilayered answers, which have enabled people from an array of 
political and moral positions to draw support and guidance from the 
Gita.


One major message from the Gita is that all life in this manifest 
world is impermanent. Every being will die. Therefore, it should 

Lecture 8—Dharma in the Bhagavad Gita 
63
not be psychologically or morally troubling either to die or to kill in 
accordance with a higher principle. 


Some advocates of nonviolence, like Mahatma Gandhi, stressed 
the former—that is, one should be prepared to die for a larger 
principle. Do not fear death if you are sincere in your commitment 
to your ideal. 


Others, like Gandhi’s assassin and other violent revolutionaries, 
concluded that it is fully justified to kill for a higher principle. Do not 
let the lives of even innocent people, let alone guilty ones, hold you 
back squeamishly from the larger and overriding goal.


In more specifically Hindu terms, the individual’s self, or atman, 
is only misperceived by many people living in this world as being 
separate from Brahman, the ground of universal being or oneness. 
Either to die or kill only relates to the self as if it had existence 
independent of the cosmos, which it does not. 


In the Gita, then, we find one of the earliest full Hindu explanations 
of rebirth, or metempsychosis. Each aman is born, dies, is reborn, and 
dies again until moksha, or release, is realized and one remerges with 
the universal Brahman, the ground of all being. As Krishna puts it:
As a man discards his worn-out clothes
And puts on different ones that are new, 
So the one in the body discards aged bodies
And joins with other ones that are new.


Arjuna asks: If life and death are futile, though, what is the point 
of any action? In response, Krishna teaches that one must act in the 
world. At the same time, one must discipline oneself not to desire or 
even consider the consequences of one’s actions.


Throughout the Gita, Krishna elaborates various paths to achieve 
this liberation from desire. For discipline or method, he uses the 

A History of India
64
Sanskrit term yoga, from the same Indo-European root word that 
produced the English word yoke. 


One path prescribed by Krishna is the discipline of action, karma 
yoga. Each of us has a swadharma, our own specific duty and code 
for conduct that we should follow selflessly. Arjuna’s is as a male 
Kshatriya—a warrior—so he should fight and, if need be, kill or die 
honorably. If one acts according to swadharma, regardless of the 
fruits of those actions, all moral questions and doubts disappear. 


Another path that Krishna preaches is the discipline of knowledge, 
jnana yoga. By acting in the world while fully understanding its 
transitory nature and also the transcendent ground of all being, we 
do not desire anything. The enlightened mind can prevent the senses 
from attaching themselves to things or beings in this transitory world. 


As Krishna explains, “Wise are they who see no difference between a 
learned, well-mannered Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and an 
eater of dogs.” In this way, we come to understand fully the nature 
of the divine. This insight makes all moral questions and doubts 
disappear. 


Further, Krishna prescribes what many people think of as meditative 
yoga: “Keeping outside the impressions from the outside world, 
centering the gaze between the eyebrows, evening inhalation and 
exhalation within the nostrils, controlling senses, mind, and spirit, 
totally devoted to release, with no trace left of desire, fear, or anger, 
[thereby] the seer is released forever.” This control makes all moral 
questions and doubts disappear. 


The next, and most innovative path, is the discipline of devotion, 
bhakti yoga. By acting in the world with total devotion to the divine, 
we do not desire anything. This devotion makes all moral questions 
and doubts disappear. 

Lecture 8—Dharma in the Bhagavad Gita 
65


Building on this concept, Krishna in the Gita reveals to Arjuna the 
unimaginable nature of the divine. But Arjuna, like most people, 
cannot comprehend or even endure the totality of divinity. 


When he looks into Krishna and sees inexorable time itself, it is so 
awesome that Arjuna begs Krishna to return to his limited earthly 
form. Later bhakti movements have all had to grapple with the 
infinity of the divine and the limits of human existence in this world.
Krishna’s Connection


In the Gita, Krishna also opens the path of devotion to all humans, 
regardless of their birth. He is not himself a Brahmin, but rather a 
Kshatriya. Unlike the Brahmanic tradition, Krishna does not base 
his authority on the sacred Vedas. Instead, Krishna speaks directly 
as the divine to Arjuna and to all people. He connects without 
intermediaries to everyone.


Therefore, anyone can act out of love for god, often in a personal 
form as Krishna appears for Arjuna. Even the humblest offering, 
or the offering of one’s self to those with nothing else, is received 
equally by god. 


The path of bhakti challenges the orthodox, Brahmanic structures of 
Hinduism and also strengthens Hinduism by incorporating diverse 
people committed to its deities on an intense personal level. 


But what’s especially innovative in the Gita is the idea that god 
loves his devotees as much, or even more, than they love god. Often, 
however, in the later bhakti movements, the devotee had to wait 
impatiently for god to reach down and pluck him or her from the 
disorder and futility of the manifest world. The metaphor often used 
is that humans awaiting god’s grace are like women in many social 
traditions awaiting a male lover to bring them to union. 

A History of India
66


Through the Gita, Krishna offers Hindus a way to salvation that 
does not depend on the Vedas, on ritual sacrifices by Brahmins, 
or on status by birth. Instead, men and women could achieve 
transcendence through their own individual actions. This message 
continues to appeal to many.

Lecture 9
The Origins and Rise of Jainism
N
onviolence is one of the most prominent, essential, and 
admirable elements in Indian culture and society. Over 2,500 
years ago, India developed Jainism, a religious tradition that 
values absolute nonviolence toward all living beings. From its origins in 
the 6th century B.C.E., Jainism has continued as an important social and 
religious community in India until today. This lecture first takes a look 
at the core beliefs of Jainism. Then it describes the work of Mahariva, a 
role model to the Jains. The lecture closes by describing why Jainism has 
endured and what it looks like today.
The Core of Jainism


At the core of Jainism is the concept of the jiva, a word that we can 
approximate with the awkward term life monad—that is, a distinct 
living entity that exists regardless of the physical body it inhabits. 
Your jiva is you, but your jiva has been born in the world before, 
sometimes as a human being, sometimes as an animal, or sometimes 
as a divinity. Jain philosophers speculated that there were 8,400,000 
different levels of births, each ranked in order from imperceptible 
motes of dust floating in the air up to divinities. 


Jains teach that your karma, meaning the deeds or actions that 
you perform in one birth, decides the level of birth in your next 
incarnation. For Jains, karma is a particulate substance, especially 
something produced by violence of any type. Some actions are so 
bad in karmic terms, like killing another jiva, that they are very 
substantial. Other actions are less violent, like violent thoughts, so 
the bad karmic matter they produce is subtler. 

A History of India
68


We can think of the jiva as an invisible sphere: when karmic matter 
sticks to it, the sphere becomes heavier, more material, and sinks in 
the next birth. 


How can a person get rid of the karma that attaches to his or her 
jiva? The process of living in this world burns off some karma. 
People, animals, divinities, and other beings who burn off more 
karma than they produce through violence will move a little higher 
in the next life. 


There are some ways of living that do little or no violence, and so 
generate little or no new bad karmic matter. Doing austerities, like 
voluntarily taking on and enduring suffering, burns off even more 
karma. Ultimately, in the Jain tradition, a truly nonviolent person can 
burn off all the karmic matter attaching to the jiva, and so escape 
from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that makes up the manifest 
world around us. 
The Model Jains


According to the Jain tradition—that is, emically—there were 24 
model Jains who, in the past, have achieved this escape. They are 
known as heroic Tirthankara, or “ford-crossers,” whose jiva have 
gone beyond this world to the total stillness beyond it. 


That state of absolute transcendence and peace is described by the 
concept of nirvana. The ultimate goal of each Jain is to emulate the 
death-conquering Tirthankaras and thus to liberate his or her jiva by 
achieving the condition of nirvana.


The last of the 24 Tirthankara remains particularly relevant to many 
Jains. He is known to his followers as Mahavira, the “great hero,” 
for his conquest over violence. He was famously born sometime 
between 600 and 540 B.C.E. to a Kshatriya family. 

Lecture 9—The Origins and Rise of Jainism



He avoided violence and embraced ascetism:


He didn’t kick his mother in the womb, nor did he cause her any 
labor pain. 


He did not follow the warrior dharma of his family but rather 
lived nonviolently, without generating any more karmic matter. 


At age 30, Mahavira renounced his family and the rest of the 
world to become an ascetic. He did austerities and let his 
clothing fall away from him, symbolic of his letting go of this 
material world. 


He ate only the minimum amount of food, and only food that 
did not contain a jiva, such as grain that had not been sprouted 
and so had no life. 


He meditated peacefully to gain insight into the true nature of 
existence. 


Mahavira’s followers took the collective title Jina, meaning 
“conquerors” of this world through nonviolence. From that term 
comes the name Jain for their religion and community. 


Most of Mahavira’s followers over the centuries have lived his 
lessons as far as they were able by adhering to five Jain vows. The 
first vow is that a true Jain must avoid killing any jivas. The other 
four Jain vows are to avoid falsehood, theft, ostentatious pride in 
one’s possessions, and un-chastity. 


Metaphysically, Jains improve the condition of their jivas to the 
extent that they live up to these five Jain vows. With less karmic 
matter attached to their jivas, they will be born higher in the next 
incarnation, and therefore better able to adhere to these Jain vows.


Mahavira himself lived for 40 years as an ascetic, spreading his 
teachings about nonviolence. Finally, he chose to burn off the last of 
his karma and thereby enable his jiva to achieve transcendence. 


He stood unmoving and therefore not disturbing even the 
microscopic jivas around him. 

A History of India

Mahavira

Lecture 9—The Origins and Rise of Jainism 
71


He stopped eating or drinking anything, fasting away his 
remaining karmic matter. 


Finally, his jiva escaped his diminished physical body, having 
achieved nirvana. The dating of his release varies between 527 
and 468 B.C.E. and is traditionally located in the lower Gangetic 
region of Magadha.


There are three levels in the Jain human social order. Highest are the 
ascetic members of the sangha, committed fully to nonviolence. 


Next are laypeople who follow the Jain path as best they can, perhaps 
to join the sangha later in life. 


Below these are people who do not follow the Jain teachings. These 
are people who live lives based on violence, including Brahmin 
priests, Kshatriya warriors, and any Vaishyas, Shudras, outcastes, 
and Adivasis who live or profit from some form of killing or other 
violence.
Why Jainism Has Endured


When considering the Jain movement from an outsider, etic 
perspective, we can see many reasons why Jainism has continued 
in India to today. Mahavira was roughly contemporary with 
Gautama the Buddha. The 6th to 5th century B.C.E. was a period of 
intellectual, cultural, social, economic, and political ferment in India 
that produced these great moral leaders and their dynamic religious 
movements. 


These competing movements vied for the hearts and minds of 
similar pools of potential followers. Mahavira not only repudiated 
the sacredness of the Veda and its Varna social order, he and his 
followers also reached out to the many non-Sanskrit speakers. 


Many Jain teachings were in one of the Prakrits, the regional languages 
of north and central India. These languages had developed from 

A History of India
72
Sanskrit but were spoken by the common people. This did away with 
the near-monopoly of access to sacred religious texts that Brahmins 
used to support their own ritually high status. 
Princess Mairavati


Over time, Jain teachers adapted popular folk stories that made them 
accessible and attractive to men and women. In one Jain parable, 
Princess Mairavati’s excessively proud father, the king, asks his 
assembled courtiers, “Do you think there is another monarch on 
earth who has as much material prosperity, illustrious court, and 
gifted kinsmen as I have?” 


Princess Mairavati, unlike the other courtiers, disagrees with this 
claim, and again when the king repeats it. Furious, the king decides 
to prove his power over Mairavati by marrying her to the poorest, 
lowliest, and sickest man in his kingdom.


Mairavati, firm in her conviction that her own karma determines her 
future, calmly accepts this husband. Even when the guardian deity 
of the kingdom offers her a young and handsome groom instead, 
Mairavati remains faithful to her husband.


Suddenly, her husband throws off his leprous body and resumes his 
true form as a divine king who has been searching for a pure woman 
to reward by making her his queen. This divine husband then forces 
Mairavati’s father to submit and to dress as a humble peasant before 
being forgiven for his baseless pride. 


Thus having received the fruits of her good karma, Mairavati 
devotes the rest of her life to Jain spiritual practices. Such a parable, 
showing an idealized woman fulfilling her moral duty, would 
appeal to many women and men, giving them great incentive to 
practice Jainism.

Visual Lessons


One Jain visual lesson in morality depicts a man hanging by two 
ropes, high up in a tree. Above him, a beehive slowly drips honey 
onto his tongue, which is his sole focus. He does not notice the black 
and white rats that are gnawing at the ropes that suspend him over 
a pit full of vipers. This often-reproduced image is a metaphor for 
human existence and a lesson about the need to transcend it. 


In artistic depictions, often a Tirthankara has behind his head a sun-
like radiant halo or the overarching and protecting hood of a many-
headed cobra. These form umbrella-like symbols of sovereignty, not 
just in the material world but over the entire cosmos as well. 


A Tirthankara conventionally has extended earlobes, showing how 
they were stretched down during his affluent youth by golden-
jeweled earrings. But these distended earlobes are now empty, 
showing that he abandoned these jeweled earrings along with the 
rest of his worldly wealth. 


A Tirthankara’s hair is customarily shown in short curls, looking 
almost like stylized snails. Most images show them wearing no 
clothing, having abandoned that as well. 


Since the Tirthankaras all ended their jiva’s existence with total 
nonviolence, they are not conventionally portrayed as active but 
rather in a meditating and unmoving pose. Later images show vines 
growing up around their legs, so long have they stood motionless. 
The Spread of Jainism


Over the centuries since Mahavira, the Jain movement spread 
beyond its original heartland in the central Gangetic plain. The 
oldest part of the tradition shifted its center to western India, today 
the regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat. These were commercial centers 
where Jain merchants flourished.

A History of India
74


Then, a branch of the Jain movement extended into south India, 
bringing in Dravidian-language speakers. Gradually, from around 
the 4th century B.C.E. onward, cultural and metaphysical differences 
developed between these two branches. The south Indian branch 
believes it has remained closer to what it preserved as the teachings 
of Mahavira himself. Known as the Digambara or “sky-clad” branch, 
its monks abandoned all clothing, as did Mahavira. This branch does 
not permit women to become nuns and therefore also reject clothing. 


The northern branch, known as Svetambara or “white-clad,” feels it 
has developed according to the essence of Jainism. In this branch, 
both monks and nuns are permitted, and they wear unstitched and 
Jain religious ritual

Lecture 9—The Origins and Rise of Jainism 
75
therefore pure simple white robes. There are also subtle philosophical 
and political differences between these two branches.


Although it has always centered on merchants, Jainism has attracted 
men and women from other ways of life as well. The founder of the 
Mauryan dynasty, Chandragupta, is claimed by Jains as a convert to 
their religion. 


Today, Jains total fewer than five million people, comprising only 0.4 
percent of the population of India. Another one or two million Jains 
live outside of India. Occasionally, Indian newspapers celebrate the 
renunciation of a rich Jain merchant who scatters all material wealth 
and takes on the monastic life, or a Jain ascetic who starves himself 
to death out of devotion to the Jain path.

Lecture 10
The Origins and Rise of Buddhism
B
uddhism began in India over 2,500 years ago. Ever since, the 
cosmic and moral truths taught by Siddhartha Gautama the 
Buddha have moved many diverse people’s hearts and minds. One 
of the core concepts in Buddhism is that any person can achieve a higher 
condition in worldly and in universal terms. This is done through giving 
generously, relinquishing desire, and practicing the nonviolent Middle 
Way between pleasure and asceticism. In this lecture, we’ll examine the 
Indian origins and early developments of Buddhism as a religion and as a 
community, both as they have come to be regarded emically from within 
that tradition and also from an etic perspective of outside historians.
Siddhartha Gautama


According to later Buddhist tradition, Prince Siddhartha Gautama 
was born around 560 B.C.E. as the heir to the royal Shakya clan, 
which ruled over a small kingdom in the Himalayan foothills. 


To protect their precious son, Siddhartha’s royal parents raised him 
in a perfect world by excluding any possible sources of sorrow. 
He mastered all the arts and pleasures. At age 16, he married his 
beautiful and pure royal cousin and soon had a son. But, as recounted 
by devout Buddhists, the gods arranged for Siddhartha to rise above 
pure pleasure by encountering the limitations of human existence in 
the world. 


Suddenly, Siddhartha saw for the first time an old man, who was 
frail, bent over, and white-haired, with few remaining teeth. Next, 
he encountered a sick man, covered in boils and shaking with fever. 
Then, Siddhartha saw a corpse being carried by sorrowing relatives 
to the cremation ground. Finally, Siddhartha perceived a wandering 

Lecture 10—The Origins and Rise of Buddhism 
77
mendicant, someone who sought to escape from the pains of this 
earthly human existence. 


These four peace-shattering sights enabled Siddhartha to free 
himself from his pleasure palace. He left behind his family and all his 
possessions, cut off his luxuriant hair, and joined a band of ascetics. 


Like the Jain teacher Mahavira, Siddhartha pushed self-sacrifice and 
austerities to the limit. Unlike Mahavira, Siddhartha found himself 
growing weaker from fasting, unable to concentrate his thoughts on 
the eternal. 


After six years as the ideal ascetic, Siddhartha repudiated that 
path of austerities, seeing them as leading not to salvation but to 
painful frustration. Instead, he resumed eating, and as his body 
strengthened, he began to meditate deeply on the nature of humanity 
and the cosmos. 


In Buddhist tradition, the various gods, especially the god of death, 
strove in vain to distract him from his meditation. Finally, sheltering 
under a sacred fig tree, he achieved enlightenment as the Buddha. 
This took place in the city of Gaya, which was then in the expanding 
north Indian kingdom of Magadha, and is now in the Indian 
province of Bihar.
After Enlightenment


Siddhartha, now the enlightened Buddha, began to preach. Later 
Buddhists recount his first sermon, which conveyed the Four Noble 
Truths and the Eightfold Path that became the core of their religion. 


The first Noble Truth asserts that this worldly existence is inherently 
filled with suffering. The second Noble Truth reveals that all this 
suffering stems from sensual desire and attachment to this world. 
The third teaches that, by withdrawing the senses, desire and 
attachment will disappear, and so too will suffering. The fourth and 

A History of India
78
final Noble Truth lays out the Buddhist Middle Way that rejects the 
extremes of both pleasure and asceticism. 


This Middle Way is the Eightfold Path that consists of right views, 
right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right 
effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. By performing 
these eight perfectly, anyone can reach nirvana, a final condition of 
absolute peace, beyond all desire and suffering. 


Throughout the rest of the Buddha’s life in this world, until his 
death at age 80 around 480 B.C.E., he lived and taught these ideals. 
When two armies from rival Indian kingdoms poised for war, the 
Buddha stepped between them and preached nonviolence. He, and 
then generations of his followers, elaborated on the meanings of the 
Buddhist truths and laid out the details for following the Middle Way. 


Early teachings were often in the Pali language rather than in the 
archaic Vedic Sanskrit preserved by Brahmins. Therefore, early 
Buddha statue

Lecture 10—The Origins and Rise of Buddhism 
79
Buddhists used the Pali term dhamma, rather than the Sanskrit 
version of the concept, dharma, in order to describe their Middle Way 
as an ideal code of conduct. 


As growing numbers of dedicated followers gathered around the 
Buddha, he organized a sangha, or monastic order. Members of the 
sangha wandered ascetically for eight months of the year. They 
then lived during the four months of the Indian monsoon rains in a 
monastery. These became the three gems of Buddhism: the Buddha, 
the dhamma, and the sangha.


According to emic accounts, the Buddha initially only accepted men 
into the sangha. But after the appeal of Siddhartha’s foster mother 
and aunt, he did allow nuns. 
The Spread


Since Buddhism accepts all who adopt its Middle Way, it spread 
rapidly among many different classes in India. The Buddha and 
subsequent Buddhist teachers developed the tactic of appropriate 
teaching—that is, presenting as much of the Buddhist message as 
that specific audience could appreciate. 


In order to convey Buddhist morality to even uneducated people, 
Buddhist teachers often adapted folk tales. Sometimes, such teachers 
used these folktales as the basis for accounts of the previous lives of 
the Buddha before he was born for the last time as Prince Siddhartha. 


In the most authoritative collection, there are 537 of these jatakas, or 
accounts of his previous lives, presented in poetic form with prose 
commentaries. Significantly, none of these jatakas have him born 
female, suggesting residual Buddhist favoring of males. 


In one jataka, for example, the Buddha-to-be is born as a royal 
Brahmin called Prince Five-Weapons. When encountering a shaggy 
ogre, he uses his poisoned arrows, sharp sword, piercing spear, and 

A History of India
80
mighty mace. Each of these, however, fails to penetrate the ogre’s 
thick, sticky, matted hair. 


The prince then uses his two fists, two feet, and forehead against the 
ogre. The only result is his being stuck fast to the ogre, who prepares 
to eat him. The prince overcomes the ogre only by teaching him the 
inevitability of death, the futility of fearing death, and the virtue of 
not killing. Consequently, the ogre is convinced of the spiritual and 
moral power of the prince, releases him, and becomes his nonviolent 
supporter. 
The Buddhist Social Model


In the Buddhist social model, people are ranked according to dana, 
that is, how much they give. Monks and nuns give up everything and 
donate their lives to following the dhamma, so they rank the highest. 
But laypeople can also follow the Middle Way, to the extent that they 
are able. 


Over time, people who gave the most, including donations to 
Buddhist monasteries and shrines, took precedence over those who 
gave less. This meant that rich merchants and kings who gave wealth 
generously stood highest among laypeople. Those others who did 
not give to Buddhism at all ranked lowest—these included Jains, 
Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and other non-Buddhist members of other 
Varnas. 


Further, according to emic Buddhist accounts, the Buddha emerged 
victorious in heated debates with leaders of these other groups, 
proving, for example, that birth was no criterion of moral worth 
despite what Brahmins claim. 


The Buddhist Middle Way attracted many converts in ancient India. 
In particular, many economically rising merchants, who could 
live without themselves killing and who had the means to give 
substantially, found Buddhism attractive. 

Lecture 10—The Origins and Rise of Buddhism 
81


In addition, men and women from other groups in Indian society 
who did not find the Brahmanic Varna model persuasive also joined 
or supported Buddhism. Shudras and other non-Kshatriyas who had 
fought their way to kingship, for example, preferred to patronize 
Brahmins less and Buddhists more. 


In India, several schools of metaphysics developed within the 
Buddhist tradition. They agreed that the individual self is incarnated 
in birth after birth, as a human or an animal. 


This self consists of a bundle of sensory perceptions and desires that 
retains karma—the good and bad actions that one has done in this 
and previous births. As one gives up desires, one’s karma is also 
released. Final liberation comes when all desires and attachments are 
relinquished and one’s self achieves nirvana, never to suffer birth, 
death, rebirth, and re-death ever again. 
After the Buddha


Upon the Buddha’s final earthly death, his body was cremated. 
Despite his teachings about the unreality and worthlessness of the 
material body, his followers preserved his ashes and charred bones 
and teeth. For many devotees, these remains contained some of the 
sacred power of the Buddha himself. In order to house these relics, 
donors, including kings and rich merchants, built hemispheric 
structures called stupas. 


In order to convey Buddhist teachings visually, artists have used 
a series of strategies. Since the Buddha had achieved transcendent 
nirvana, some early artists portrayed him by his absence. Some early 
Buddhist sculptors used the tree of enlightenment with an absence 
beneath it indicating Buddha. 


Other sculptors convey the same message by showing the Buddha’s 
footprint, indented with the auspicious marks of his sole. Yet others 

A History of India
82
show the symbolic wheel of dhamma, which rolls throughout the 
cosmos establishing the Buddhist law.
A World Religion


Over the centuries, Buddhism became a world religion, spreading 
throughout much of Asia. Starting around the 3rd century B.C.E., 
missionaries from mainland India went to Sri Lanka, where the 
vast majority of the population converted. There, they followed 
the original teachings, called the Theravada or Hinayana (“Lesser 
Vehicle”) form. 


From Sri Lanka, this form of Buddhism spread to Southeast Asia, 
where it remains dominant in Burma (now Myanmar), Thailand, Laos, 
Cambodia, and Indonesia. Other religious traditions from India, like 
A stupa

Lecture 10—The Origins and Rise of Buddhism 
83
Hinduism also extended along these routes. But, in each case, local 
societies adapted these religious traditions to their own cultures.


As Buddhist ideas in India continued to develop, the Mahayana 
(“Greater Vehicle”) form emerged around the 1st century C.E. This 
spread by land into what is today Afghanistan. From Afghanistan, 
Mahayana Buddhism spread to China and then to Japan, adapting to 
local traditions as it went.



The third major type of Buddhism to develop in India is known 
as the Vajrayana, or the “Thunderbolt Vehicle,” since, among other 
doctrines, it features sudden enlightenment. By the 7th century, this 
form had spread to Nepal and Tibet.


Although India was the land where Siddhartha Gautama the Buddha 
lived and taught, Buddhism died out there over the centuries, in part 
because of wealthy donors causing the religion to lose its connection 
with the general populace. By the 7th century C.E., when a Chinese 
pilgrim, Xuanzang, came to India seeking relics and original Buddhist 
scriptures, he found very little evidence that Buddhism had survived 
there.


Then, in the mid–20th century, a Buddhist community reappeared in 
India. B. R. Ambedkar was a major leader of the low-ranked social 
group that used to be called untouchables but that now prefer the 
term Dalit, those who have been oppressed or ground down. 


Buddhism discounted a person’s status by birth and instead stressed 
his or her individual achievement. Further, it was deeply Indian in 
its origins. Seeing this, Ambedkar led many of his Dalit followers 
to become Buddhists. Today, there are about 8 million Buddhists in 
India, mostly so-called neo-Buddhist Dalits.

Lecture 11
The Mauryan Empire
T
his lecture looks at the career of Chandragupta Maurya and the 
empire he founded in north India in 320 B.C.E. His empire was 
exceptional in Indian history. Chandragupta had to draw together 
many competing regional states and diverse communities and cultures. 
Through Chandragupta’s many military and diplomatic conquests, he 
extended his empire over more of South Asia than any previous ruler 
had ever managed to do. To examine Chandragupta, we’ll start with a 
description of the area from which he began his rule, then look at his 
martial and political exploits, and close with Chandragupta’s late-in-life 
transformation.
Magadha


By about 600 B.C.E., 16 maha janapadas, or “great people’s places,” 
had emerged across north and central India through conquest 
and consolidation of the earlier 600–700 janapadas. These smaller 
janapadas still survived in their own home regions, but they also 
became components as provinces within these 16 larger states. 


Over the next century, out of the 16, five even larger maha janapada 
states emerged. One of these five seems to have been governed by 
some sort of council, with the raja as war leader. The other four, 
including Magadha, were evidently ruled by a hereditary raja as king.


Unlike the other janapadas, the Magadha region of the middle 
Ganges plain is particularly well endowed with natural resources. 
This meant that as people gradually settled down in the Magadha 
janapada, circa 600 B.C.E., they had much economic potential. 

A History of India
86


They slowly cleared the parts of the region that had been under 
primeval forests, incorporating or pushing away the Adivasi living 
in them. The enterprising farmers of Magadha increasingly learned 
how to manage the water and soil to cultivate wet rice. 


Through experience, they even mastered the multistage method for 
producing two harvests of rice in a single calendar year. This requires 
farmers to start the second rice crop in nursery fields, even before the 
first crop has been harvested from the main fields. The farmers and 
their laborers must then carefully transplant the rice seedlings into 
the main fields right after they are harvested and prepared for the 
next crop. This technique requires very careful watering.


This kind of intensive rice agriculture is about three times as productive 
as dry crops like wheat, millet, or barley, so Magadha could generate 
more grain and support a much denser population than could many 
other rival regions of its day. Hence, the ruler in Magadha had more 
resources to draw upon than his neighboring kings. 

Lecture 11—The Mauryan Empire 
87


The mountainous and hilly areas nearby were a natural habitat for 
wild elephants. Some Adivasi communities in those regions had 
mastered elephant catching and taming. The ruler of Magadha 
could obtain such elephants by taxing, trading, or raiding Adivasis. 
Elephants trained for work or warfare were highly valuable. 


The same areas in and around Magadha were also sources of vital 
wood and minerals. Those areas have long produced much of India’s 
coal and iron supply. Together, timber, coal, and iron enabled the 
artisans of Magadha’s growing towns and cities to produce metal 
tools, weapons, and other artifacts. 


But many economically upwardly mobile merchants did not find 
the relatively low status assigned to them in the Brahmanic Varna 
system very attractive. They often sought alternative religious and 
social models. Magadha lay beyond the upper Gangetic heartland of 
Brahmanism, which meant there was more opportunity for people 
there to consider non-Vedic models. 


Gautama the Buddha gained followers in Magadha, including one 
of its early kings. Many others in Magadha turned to Jainism, in 
which anyone, regardless of birth, could follow the Jain path based 
on its five vows: nonviolence, no lying, no theft, no ostentatious 
display or pride in one’s material possessions, and chastity. The most 
prominent Jain leader, Mahavira, personally taught in Magadha and 
then himself gained nirvana near Rajagriha, the growing capital city 
of that kingdom.
Rulers


Often in human history, a charismatic political leader can harness the 
potential of a region and develop it into a powerful and expansive 
kingdom or empire. In Magadha, a series of such rulers emerged.


The first of Magadha’s dynamic rajas we know by name is Bimbisara, 
but evidence about him is limited. He rose to rule around 500 B.C.E. 

A History of India
88
He evidently spurred on the economy of Magadha by fostering 
agriculture, hand manufacturing, and trade. He also built up his state’s 
power to govern and control his subjects by ordering the construction 
of roads and a more regular and effective system of taxation. 


Through a war of conquest and a marriage alliance, Bimbisara 
subordinated additional janapadas to his realm, although they 
were never incorporated very extensively. His reign ended abruptly 
in 490  B.C.E. when his even more ambitious son, Ajatashatru, 
overthrew, imprisoned, and executed him. 


This new king expanded his empire based in Magadha even further 
by conquest over neighboring janapadas. But there were limits 
on how far his empire could expand: His governance and war 
technology could not even attain an empire that extended across 
north India. 
Chandragupta Rises


Although the Magadha region itself remained a powerful base, in 
the following century, three other dynasties successively seized 
rule there. The third of these upstart dynasties was founded by 
Chandragupta Maurya. 


He led a rebellion that grabbed power in 320 B.C.E. He made his 
capital Pataliputra, near where the current city of Patna is located. 
This was an especially strategic location on the south bank of the 
Ganges River.


Chandragupta’s dramatic rise to power has long been associated 
emically with his close Brahmin advisor and then chief minister, 
Chanakya. He embodied mastery over all the sciences of politics. His 
pitiless assassination tactics, networks of spies, and constant testing 
of the loyalty of the king’s ministers and generals became legendary. 

Lecture 11—The Mauryan Empire 
89
Alexander’s Influence


Chandragupta had another major, but inadvertent, aid to the 
expansion of his empire. This was a series of dramatic events far 
from Magadha on India’s western frontier, over 1,000 miles away. 


The dynamic Persian Achaemenid Empire had long extended its 
power over the Indian lands west of the Indus River. But when 
Alexander inherited the throne of Macedonia at age twenty in 336 
B.C.E., he determined to conquer the world. He marched his army 
east and rapidly defeated the Persian Emperor Darius III, and thus 
ended the Achaemenid Empire. 


Alexander the Great was not yet satisfied. By 327 B.C.E., he had led 
his army into far western India, crossing the Indus. Several kings in 
the region of the Punjab submitted to him, and others fought bravely 
against this invader from the west. Although Alexander’s army 
eventually triumphed, these were bloody and exhausting campaigns. 


Finally, the Greek core of Alexander’s army refused to go any further. 
These soldiers had been on the march for eight long years without 
a break. Although Alexander personally wanted to continue east to 
the end of the world, his soldiers convinced him to return westward. 
After a decade of campaigning, he died in Babylon at age 32. 


Alexander’s army’s migrations had left behind many distant colonies. 
These cities opened up trade routes that linked Greece, Egypt, and 
India, along which many subsequent ideas, goods, and people 
would travel in both directions for centuries thereafter. Magadha lay 
at the eastern end of this new intercontinental trade network, and it 
prospered as its economy was even further stimulated.


While several of Chandragupta’s rivals to his west had been fatally 
damaged by battling Alexander, Magadha was too far away to 
be weakened. Chandragupta marched his own vast forces from 
Magadha into the disordered region along the Indus River.

Seleucus and Megasthenes


There, Chandragupta fought until 303 B.C.E. against another Greek 
army, this one led by Alexander’s general and would-be successor 
in Asia, Seleucus I Nicator. After this bloody battle, Chandragupta 
evidently gained the advantage. The ensuing truce treaty gained 
Chandragupta the daughter of Seleucus as a bride and also rule 
over the lands west of the Indus as far as Baluchistan and Kabul. In 
exchange, Chandragupta gave 500 elephants to Seleucus.


Seleucus also sent a courtier and diplomat, Megasthenes, as his 
ambassador to Chandragupta. He lived at Chandragupta’s court for 
four years (302–298 B.C.E). Megasthenes was a keen observer who 
recorded what he saw and heard about Chandragupta’s empire and 
about India’s wonders. 


His original text has not survived, but later Greek and Roman 
historians who had access to it paraphrased it extensively. 
Megasthenes thus provides a valuable outsider’s account, although 
he did not always understand what he was seeing. 


Megasthenes described Chandragupta’s thriving capital city of 
Pataliputra, which he said extended nine miles along the banks 
of the Ganges River. The outer palisades surrounding the city 
were guarded by more than 600 towers and fortified gateways. 
Megasthenes also lauded Chandragupta’s vast wooden palace, from 
which he controlled an extensive and effective administration. 


Megasthenes described a board of 30 counselors who advised and 
implemented the emperor’s directives. There were also six separate 
departments of state, each charged with a different responsibility, 
from promoting the economy, to registering births and deaths, to 
attending to foreign ambassadors and guests like Megasthenes. He 
evidently asserted that Chandragupta’s administration accomplished 
all this without the use of any written records, since they had no 
system of writing.

A History of India
92
Chandragupta’s Reign 


Territories from Afghanistan in the west, Bengal in the east, and over 
part of the central Indian Deccan Plateau in the south came under 
Chandragupta’s sway. But, as elaborate as his administration was, it 
did not penetrate very deep into the society and into the culture of 
the many janapadas that acknowledged Chandragupta’s rule. 


Thus, his empire had deep roots only in Magadha, although it 
extended much further over the lands of north and part of central 
India. We might visualize his empire as a vast umbrella, which 
is a common Indian symbol of sovereignty. The central pillar 
was Magadha, but the canopy only cast its protection over the 
surrounding janapadas.
Chandragupta’s Religion


It may seem incongruous for such a battle-proven conquering 
emperor to become a Jain, that religion of absolute nonviolence. 
While none of the surviving historical sources say much about 
Chandragupta’s character, his actions show him to be a bold, even 
ruthless warrior. 


Perhaps he finally found the horrors of war too much to face. For 
whatever personal reason, there is much evidence that Chandragupta 
eventually relinquished his throne after more than two decades of 
bloody rule and became a Jain monk. Further, he evidently ended his 
life by fasting to death, thus burning off the bad karmic matter from 
the many acts of violence that had caked his jiva, or life monad. 


Jain texts assert that he did this out of personal conviction. He may 
have felt remorse for the many deaths of people and other living 
things that had accompanied his rise to power and the expansion of 
his empire. 


But we can also see why he may have pragmatically supported 
Jainism during his reign. Many in the rising class of merchants that 

Lecture 11—The Mauryan Empire 
93
had powered his empire economically were also Jains. Also, as a 
relatively low-born king, Chandragupta may have not accepted

Lecture 12
Ashoka’s Imperial Buddhism
I
n India, even today, the most famous and celebrated person from 
ancient history is Emperor Ashoka of the Mauryan dynasty. There are 
many reasons why he has been so extensively idealized. He ruled an 
empire that encompassed not only virtually all of the current Republic 
of India but almost all of South Asia. While Ashoka was a victorious 
conqueror, he later became known for his nonviolence and energetic 
benevolence as ruler. This lecture looks at his record as a ruler, his 
embrace of Buddhism, and the decline of his empire following his death.
From Chandragupta to Ashoka


Ashoka inherited what had already become an empire of a 
scale unprecedented in Indian history. Ashoka’s grandfather, 
Chandragupta, had risen up to found their Mauryan dynasty as 
the ruler of the resource-rich north Indian region of Magadha. He 
eventually reigned from Afghanistan in the west to Bengal in the 
east, and across much of the Deccan highlands of central India. 


Chandragupta evidently abdicated and starved himself to death 
in the ideal Jain way. Though Chandragupta’s son and direct heir, 
Emperor Bindusara, left little evidence of this reign, a disordered 
interregnum seems to have followed. 


However, by 269 B.C.E., Chandragupta’s grandson Ashoka finally 
eliminated all his royal rivals and controlled Magadha and its 
remaining subordinate provinces. During Ashoka’s first 10 years 
of rule, he consolidated his power and developed the efficiency of 
his army and administration. One of his most effective measures 
appears to be his creation of the very first Indian system of writing, 
today called the Brahmi script. 

Lecture 12—Ashoka’s Imperial Buddhism 
95


Scholars continue to debate where Ashoka took the elements of the 
Brahmi script from. At present, there are two leading theories about 
the source of Ashoka’s Brāhmī script. 


The first and earliest of these theories, developed mostly by European 
scholars, is that the Brahmi script developed from the Semitic script 
via Aramaic. The second main scholarly position is that Brahmi came 
from an Indian source, which would please many Indians. 


Another plausible explanation for the first development of the Brahmi 
script is that Emperor Ashoka directed his officials to create it out of 
several existing sources already present in India. In this explanation, 
Ashoka may have had his officials draw upon a system of record-
keeping then used by Indian merchants. Such an indigenous origin 
would especially please many Indians who identify with Ashoka. 


The Brahmi script matches the sounds of the popular Indic languages 
derived from Sanskrit, including Pāli, the language of the Buddha’s 
teachings and most of Ashoka’s inscriptions. 


Over the following centuries, the Brahmi script clearly evolved into 
today’s writing systems of both the north Indian Sanskrit-derived 
languages and the four major south Indian Dravidian languages. 
However, these systems of writing have since changed so much that 
north Indian writing and south Indian writing look very different 
and are mutually illegible.


Since Ashoka’s administration used the Brāhmī script, they must 
have also had something to write it on. The most common technique 
in India was to use a flattened palm leaf. Ashoka’s administration 
probably used that, or wrote on wood, cloth, or leather. But all of 
these are very perishable, and so no actual records on these materials 
have survived from his reign. 


Instead, all the surviving Ashokan writings were carved on polished 
rocks and on stone pillars. Although weathered and eroded, these

96
have lasted for more than 2,300 years. However, their meaning had 
been lost for most of that long period. The Brahmi script continued 
to develop so that, a few centuries later, no one alive could read it in 
its oldest form. 
The Turn to Buddhism


Generally, ancient, long-forgotten scripts can be deciphered when 
they appear along with the same message written in other scripts 
that we do know how to read. Bilingual coins from a later Indo-
Greek ruler enabled a British chemist, antiquarian, and orientalist in 
India, James Prinsep, to decipher Kharoshthi, the other script used 
by Ashoka, and from that to decipher the Brahmi script. 


According to Emperor Ashoka’s own chronology in the inscriptions, 
eight years after he gained the throne, he led his armies to victory 
in an especially brutal and bloody war. The enemy was the land 
Emperor Ashoka accompanied by troops

called Kalinga, which we call Odisha province of eastern India today. 
Then, as now, many Adivasis lived in the area’s interior forested 
hills. Kalinga was near Magadha, so it must have been an especially 
resistant and fierce holdout against the Mauryan Empire to remain 
unconquered for so long. 


As Ashoka himself recalls, in this war of conquest his armies killed 
100,000 local people and deported or enslaved 150,000 more. Even 
vaster numbers died from the devastation of their region. While 
these specific figures are probably not exact, the massive violence that 
Ashoka inflicted shocked even him into reconsidering his entire role 
as emperor and in life. 


As a result of this horrific war, Ashoka began to turn to Buddhism. 
In another inscription, Ashoka also credits one of his most 
charitable queens, Karuvaki, who, he says, guided him toward the 
Buddhist path. 


Becoming a Buddhist while ruling a vast empire, however, had to 
be a gradual process. Ashoka recorded how difficult it was for 
him, writing, “at first I did not make much progress.” It was even 
more difficult for him to make his imperial household completely 
vegetarian. He writes: “Formerly in the Beloved of the God’s kitchen 
several hundred thousand animals were killed daily for food; but 
now at the time of writing only three are killed—two peacocks and a 
deer, though the deer not regularly. Even these three animals will not 
be killed in future.”


For whatever reason, Ashoka does not discuss the transcendent goal 
of Buddhism, called nirvana. Instead, he repeatedly asserts that all 
those who follow the Buddhist dhamma will be reborn in heaven. 


For him as a Buddhist emperor, that dhamma meant protecting 
the poor and weak—the slaves and servants among his subjects. 
He ordered his governors to implement uniform, impartial, and 
predictable administration and regulations.

A History of India
98


For the officials governing the shattered region of Kalinga, he gave 
special instructions, publicly available for anyone to see, that the 
devastated people should be reconciled with and won over. He also 
made Dhauli, the site of the bloodiest battle of his conquest, into 
a center where monks, nuns, and other Buddhists could assemble 
and pray.


It was even more difficult to make all the people of his empire follow 
the Buddhist dhamma of nonviolence. Ashoka tried diligently to 
convince them that Buddhism was more virtuous and effective than 
other religions, including Jainism, which had been followed by his 
grandfather, and the Brahmanic Vedic tradition, which was followed 
by the vast majority of his subjects. 


He created a ministry of dhamma and sent out state officials as 
missionaries to persuade people to follow dhamma. But Ashoka did 
not outlaw the other religious beliefs and practices of his subjects. 
An exception: He did ban Brahmanic Vedic animal sacrifices in his 
capital, although he evidently could not forbid them outside of it.


Ashoka performed the Buddhist duty of dana, giving to the Buddhist 
sangha of monks and nuns. But he also gave charity to Brahmin and 
Jain teachers and ascetics.
Rock Inscriptions and Pillars


Since Ashoka and his officials could not be everywhere in his vast 
empire, he ordered his decrees inscribed on many smoothly polished 
rock faces and on stone columns. Ashoka clearly wanted the local 
people to be able to read and understand these inscriptions, having 
them written in local languages. 


By plotting the location of each site of his surviving rock inscriptions, 
we can see an outline of the extent of his empire. Almost all of South 
Asia, except the very southern tip, seems to have recognized his 
sovereignty, however distantly. 

Lecture 12—Ashoka’s Imperial Buddhism

Ashoka pillar

A History of India
100


Ashoka also ordered a sandstone quarry at Chunar near Banaras to 
carve out many 40-foot-long pillars, each weighing up to 50 tons. 
These massive columns were transported by animal-drawn carts for 
hundreds of miles to key sites within his empire, polished smooth, 
and inscribed with his edicts. 
Innovations


Ashoka is credited with organizing and systematizing Buddhism. 
Around 250 B.C.E., he called to his imperial capital all the major 
Buddhist leaders for what would be the third great Buddhist council. 
There, they codified the Buddhist canon in the Pali language and 
established doctrinal boundaries, meaning that some heterodox sects 
were declared non-Buddhist. 


While Ashoka repeated his personal and official commitment to 
Buddhism, he was still the ruler of a vast empire. He advocated for 
peaceful obedience from his subjects, but should any oppose him, 
he promised severe punishment. He vowed to protect the trees and 
animals of the forests that still made up a sizable part of his realm, 
and he warned the Adivasis against destroying imperial trees or 
animals. 


To foster commerce, as well as the movement of his officials and 
armies, Ashoka constructed roads across his vast empire. Along 
these, he ordered that shady trees and mango fruit groves be planted 
and that refreshing ponds and wells be dug along them.


Nevertheless, communication and the movement of officials and 
armies remained relatively slow. Controlling so many diverse regions 
and cultures, over such vast distances, has historically proven very 
difficult for all empires in South Asia. The Mauryan Empire was the 
first empire of pan-Indian scale. 


While Ashoka seems to have directly governed the region around 
his imperial capital, Pataliputra, he sent out at least three and 

Lecture 12—Ashoka’s Imperial Buddhism 
101
perhaps more relatively autonomous governors to administer the 
empire’s other distant provinces. But governors and officials did 
not always follow his directives. Ashoka lamented that officers did 
not always completely understand what he wanted, and that unjust 
imprisonment and torture were a problem. 
The Decline


Ashoka wanted to make his regime and its principles eternal, but his 
dynasty lasted only five decades after his death.


There were many reasons for the rapid decline of the Mauryan 
Empire. Such a patrimonial state needed an exceptionally strong 
leader like Ashoka. Evidently, none of his Mauryan heirs could rise 
to his level of power or authority. 


The technology available to the imperial administration had been 
overstretched, one example being slow communication over such a 
vast expanse of territory. 


Taxes no longer flowed to the imperial capital and emperor’s 
treasury. Instead, various governors asserted their autonomy from 
the imperial center, keeping local revenues and establishing their 
own regimes.


Further, the strongly distinct identities of India’s historical regions, 
based on language and on social and economic bonds, reemerged 
from under the Ashokan. The glue of Buddhism that Ashoka had tried 
to use to hold together his universal imperium could not withstand 
the pull of the more regionally grounded Brahmanic traditions. 


Therefore, although some Mauryan successors sustained a rump 
kingdom for 50 years after Ashoka’s death, a Brahmin imperial 
general assassinated and displaced the last, weak Mauryan king 
around 187 B.C.E. That general founded his own Shunga Brahmin 
dynasty in Magadha.

Deccani and Southern States
T
he fragmentation of the Mauryan Empire in the 2nd century B.C.E 
began a millennium during which many different regionally 
based kingdoms briefly expanded and then shrank. Despite the 
chaos, there were a few patterns: Overall, the economy grew; different 
social classes and groups sought appealing ideological and religious 
systems; and tension grew between resilient local cultures and kingdoms 
on one side and outsiders on the other. These broader processes occurred 
within each of the four macro-regions of the Indian subcontinent during 
the post-Mauryan age. These macro-regions were the Indus River 
and northwest, Gangetic north India, the Deccan highland, and the 
peninsular south. In this lecture, we’ll concentrate first on the Deccan 
highland and then turn to the far south. 
Links


While the Deccan highland and the south were in many ways 
distinct, they were not isolated from each other. First, rivers and 
trade linked them. Many of the most important rivers flow east 
or southeast from the upland Deccan to the seashore. Merchants 
conveyed crops and products up and down these rivers between the 
interior and the coast. 


There was a cultural gradient rather than a sharp divide between 
these two macro-regions. The northern Deccan incorporated both 
Sanskritic north Indian and also Adivasi and Dravidian cultures. 
Moving south reveals less north Indian culture and more Adivasi 
and Dravidian features. 


This is clearly evident in the dominant languages. In the north 
Deccan, the major languages, like Marathi, Hindi, and Odia, are 

A History of India
104
derived from Sanskrit. However, from even earlier, many Dravidian-
language-speaking people had settled in the southern Deccan and 
in south India’s various and diverse ecological niches. There they 
developed the four major languages in the Dravidian language 
family: Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, and Malayalam. 


The Dravidian society of the south did not conform easily to the 
Brahmanic model, and Sanskrit was a language from outside 
the culture—a language that only a small, elite percentage of the 
society used. 
The Satavahana Dynasty


With the fragmentation of the Mauryan Empire, various regionally 
based rulers and governors asserted their autonomy. The most 
prominent of these in the Deccan area was the Satavahana dynasty. 


They had apparently been locally powerful chieftains who accepted 
the lordship of Emperor Ashoka Maurya. They were originally 
based in the western part of the Deccan plateau, today inland in the 
Maharashtra province of India. When the Mauryan dynasty ended, 

Lecture 13—Deccani and Southern States 
105
the Satavahanas reasserted their own kingship. Then they spread 
their regime eastward. Eventually, they also became known as the 
Andhra dynasty, which is the name of the eastern part of the Deccan. 


The Satavahanas also reached militarily and politically toward both 
the north and the south. To their northwest, they faced the incoming 
Sakas, who were central Asians who erupted into India from the 
northwest and settled in what today are Gujarat and Rajasthan. The 
Satavahanas and Saka kings alternated victories with defeats, with 
no ruler being able to hold onto his military conquests for very long. 


In contrast, the Satavahanas achieved greater military success 
advancing southward down the Godavari River to the southeast 
coast of India. By spanning the Deccan from coast to coast, the 
Satavahana Empire prospered through overseas trade.	


But the loosely controlled Satavahana empire could not last. Saka 
armies weakened and fragmented the Satavahanas by about 220 C.E., 
although a rump of the Satavahana state lasted a few decades longer. 
The Pallava Dynasty


One of the Satavahana dynasty’s successors in its southeast was the 
Pallava dynasty. For about 600 years (from the 4th century through the 
9th century C.E.), the Pallava regime dominated the agriculturally and 
commercially rich lands around Kanchipuram, in India’s southeast.


This region receives irrigation from both rivers flowing down 
from the Deccan and also from seasonal rains during the northeast 
monsoon. 
This 
makes 
rice 
growing 
especially 
productive. 
Additionally, inland and overseas trade brought riches.


The origins of the Pallavas are ambiguous, perhaps intentionally 
obscured as a series of different families over the centuries each tried 
to claim that dynastic name. More certain is that the first Pallavas 
were local subordinates of the Satavahana conquerors. The earliest 

A History of India
106
firm historical evidence of the Pallava dynasty has been preserved 
on copper plates that we can date to around 275 C.E. This was just 
when the Satavahana empire was fragmenting and its subordinated 
kings were breaking free. 


Over the next centuries, Pallava armies sporadically conquered 
north and south up the Tamil coast. At their peak in the late 6th 
century, their armies conquered westward up the rivers into the 
dry interior, even as far as the Western Ghats, covering about 7,000 
square miles. The Pallavas also created a navy in order to extend 
their power into the island of Sri Lanka. But beyond their core 
region, Pallava rule tended to be relatively thin, enforced by armies 
but also by the soft power of their culture.


For example, one especially prominent Pallava king, Mahendravarman 
I, who ruled from 600 to 630 C.E., proved himself a cultured man 
as well as a successful warrior. Some of his surviving inscriptions 
describe how he was born a Jain but then converted to the Hindu sect 
of Shaivism due to the influence of Saint Appar. 


Appar was a famous poet and leader of a Tamil religious movement 
devoted to Shiva, the major Hindu god of creative destruction. 
Appar had also converted from Jainism. 


Even if this may not prove to be a historically accurate biography of 
Mahendravarman, it shows how Jain and Hindu Shaivite religious 
communities were in tension, each seeking to bring the Pallava king 
into its community. But the Shaivites seem to have won since the 
Pallava royal seal showed the lingam, or phallic, symbol of Shiva 
and also an image of his vehicle, the bull Nandi.


Eventually, Pallava kings lost power, and their empire fragmented 
by the late 9th century. Their Tondaimandalam region remained 
agriculturally rich, with prosperous land and overseas trading 
networks, although now under the rule of former Pallava 
subordinates. 

Lecture 13—Deccani and Southern States 
107
Pallava Successors


Among the Pallavas’ successors were the Cholas based in the temple 
town of Thanjavur (or Tanjore). They largely took over the coastal 
plain of the southeast part of the peninsula and extended their trade 
and naval power extensively in Southeast Asia. These were again a 
series of families that claimed that same dynastic title. 


Under the Cholas, temples became ever larger and more elaborate. 
Some were vastly wealthy from donations. For example, the 
Thanjavur temple reportedly had an annual income from 300 villages 
that totaled 500 pounds of gold, 250 pounds of jewels, and 600 
pounds of silver. This temple alone employed 600 people including 
priests, temple dancers, and 57 musicians and text readers. 


Another eventual successor dynasty were the Pandyans. They were 
based not in the wetter coast but rather in the dryer upland interior of 
the Tamil-speaking region. The royal Pandyan dynasty is mentioned 
in texts dating from the 4th century B.C.E. The dynastic title lasted, in 
one form or another through a series of families, for about 1,500 years. 
The Cholas and Pandyans serve as excellent examples of the Dravidian 
model of kingship that was strongest in peninsular south India. 
Local Deities


As various local communities settled in south India and elsewhere, 
they often focused on a local deity. Emically these deities spoke 
the local language, in this case Tamil. Many were fierce warrior 
goddesses who ate the meat offered them by their non-vegetarian 
devotees. Their martial and cosmic energy, or Shakti, was enhanced. 
Many of these goddesses were also unmarried, so their Shakti was 
not controlled by a husband. This made them especially powerful 
but also dangerous to those who opposed or disregarded them. 


Some such local goddesses represented major diseases, for example, 
smallpox. Any devotee who survived that disease did so through the 
grace of the goddess. 

A History of India
108


In the Dravidian state model, the local deity stood as the divine 
sovereign while the king customarily served as the divinity’s first-
ranked human worshipper and earthly agent. 


Over time, however, many south Indian kings like the Cholas and 
Pandyans wished to attract into their kingdoms Brahmins and their 
ritual prestige and authority. Such kings conventionally gave gifts of 
tax-free land in order to entice these Brahmins to settle. 


An all-Brahmin community became known as an agrahara. Each 
agrahara was surrounded by its fields and dependent villages, where 
the lower-ranked tenants did the farming but lived outside the 
agrahara.


In many cases, Brahmin priests gained control over already 
important local religious sites and temples. The model of fierce meat-
eating, unmarried local goddesses, however, did not conform to 
conventional Brahmanic concepts of the divine. 


In etic terms, we can perceive a process by which these local deities 
were incorporated into the Brahmanic model. This is a process 
named Sanskritization by the distinguished Indian anthropologist 
M. N. Srinivas, since Sanskrit is the premier and sacred Brahmanic 
language. To Sanskritize is for a lower-ranked family or community 
to aspire to upward ritual and social mobility by imitating the ways 
of life of Brahmins or Kshatriyas.


In cases where the local deity is male, he might be Sanskritized into 
a manifestation or son of a Brahmanic male god, especially Vishnu 
or Shiva. If the local deity is female, she might be ritually wedded 
to a male Brahmanic god. But many local people still envisioned the 
deity in her earlier, local identity as their own. This sometimes let to 
tension over possession of the identity and property of that deity.

Lecture 13—Deccani and Southern States 
109
Minakshi


As a prime example of the Sanskritization process, we can consider 
the Pandyan dynasty and the goddess Minakshi in their major south 
Indian pilgrimage city, Madurai. 


Minakshi conventionally has a green complexion and holds a parrot. 
She first emerged from a sacred pond full of golden lotuses. This 
suggests in etic terms that she might have originally been a local 
Adivasi forest goddess taken over by Dravidian culture.


The earliest historical accounts have her as a Tamil-speaking, fierce, 
unmarried, meat-eating goddess. In emic terms, her divine Shakti 
enabled the local Pandyan dynasty to conquer and rule the region 
for generations, with her Madurai home as the dynasty’s capital.


But after she was Sanskritized, the Brahmanic history of Minakshi 
became that she was the all-Indian goddess Parvati, the consort of 
the god Shiva. She had originally agreed as an act of grace to be born 
on earth as the daughter of the Pandyan king. The Pandyan king and 
queen had been promised a son, but instead they received a daughter 
with three breasts. They raised her as a warrior. 


She led the Pandyan armies to victory in all directions, over both 
earthly kings and also over all but one of the gods. When she 
confronted Shiva, her husband in heaven and her husband to be on 
earth, however, her third breast disappeared. She became shy, and she 
accepted him as her lord. 


One of the major rituals in the city of Madurai is the reenactment 
of the wedding of Minakshi to Shiva. The Brahmanic god Vishnu 
stood as the bride’s brother, giving her to her groom. Being invited 
to attend this wedding, and being seated near the ceremony, remains 
for many leading people in the region a symbolic high mark of status.


Today, the major temple in Madurai includes Minakshi’s original 
golden lotus pond and her special shrine. But they are now off center, 

A History of India
110
with the main part of the temple now being the home of Shiva and 
Minakshi as a married couple. This vast temple complex dominates 
the heart of the original city of Madurai.

Lecture 14
Northwest and North India
I
n the last lecture, we considered the Deccan and peninsular South 
India following the fragmentation of the Mauryan Empire in the 2nd 
century B.C.E. Now we can concentrate on developments within and 
between India’s other two macro-regions in the millennium after the 
Mauryan Empire’s fragmentation. On the Gangetic plain, the expanding 
agricultural and trade-based economy supported social and cultural 
changes that powered the Gupta Empire and other expansive states. 
In the northwest, martial and peaceful immigrants from Central Asia 
periodically entered the Indus plain, linking India by land with other 
Asian lands and the Mediterranean. 
Knowledge Sources


There is little architecture and few surviving artifacts from the 
northwest and the Gagnetic plain that we can study to learn about 
the culture and technology of that time. 


One potential source: A hoard of coins accidently lost and later 
discovered by chance can tell us the names, religious affiliations, 
and titles of rulers whose coins were included. Material quality and 
minting techniques can tell us about economic health and metallurgy 
methods. 


Religious texts from this period also contain rich information. During 
this period, we do begin to see more examples of the Sanskrit Purana 
genre, meaning accounts of the “ancient.” These conventionally 
begin with the creation of the universe, and highlight the origins of 
deities and the cycles of cosmic time. 

A History of India
112


Some of these Puranas also include the genealogies of dynasties 
(often from a divine ancestor) and lists of the dynasty’s kings. But 
there was no standardized chronological system in place across 
India, so they are often hard to date very accurately. Further, these 
and other texts do not usually state who the writer was, except that 
they were often attributed to a divine or legendary author.


Kings during this period made special efforts to glorify themselves 
in inscriptions, some of which have survived. From the 2nd century 
C.E., royal inscriptions tended to follow a very eulogizing style. 
They often vastly inflate claims, listing many more defeated or 
subordinated kings and regions conquered than actually occurred.
Movement of People


One of the main recurrent features of the post-Mauryan millennium 
was the growing movement of people and commerce into and out of 
India through the northwest, what is today Afghanistan on one side 
of the mountain passes and the Indus River plain on the other. 


Alexander the Great’s invasion of 327 B.C.E. had destabilized 
the kingdoms in that region and left it a cultural shatter zone. 
Greek, Iranian, Central Asian, and even Chinese people and 
cultures overlapped with Indian ones there. Trade routes linking 
the Mediterranean, India, and China flourished and enriched 
communities and kingdoms along the way. This later became known 
as the Silk Road, although many different high-value products 
flowed along it.


On the western flank of this region were Iranian-based empires. The 
Seleucids had arisen as the successors to Alexander’s eastern empire. 
But their own eastern governors, or satraps, in Afghanistan and the 
Punjab soon asserted their autonomy. These many small kingdoms 
are collectively described by historians as Indo-Greek Bactrians. This 
suggests that they built upon Indian Buddhist, Hindu, Greek, and 
Central Asian cultures and state formations. 

Lecture 14—Northwest and North India 
113
The Kushanas


A series of Central Asian groups brought trade and periodic raids. 
One of these groups aggressively migrated into the northwest as far 
as the Indus plain and then ruled there. These were the Kushanas, 
probably known to the Chinese as the dangerous Yuezhi. 


One of their most powerful early kings, Kanishka, and his successors 
recognized and built their authority on the cultures of the array of 
people they ruled. For example, some Kushana rulers proclaimed 
their royal status using Greek, Roman, Iranian, Chinese, and Indian 
titles simultaneously.


The Kushanas dominated the northwest region from the 1st through 
the 3rd centuries, gaining control of key parts of the Silk Road. 
Eventually, however, the Kushanas were subordinated during the 
4th–5th century by the Sasanian Empire of Iran, which mounted 
expeditions eastward into the Indus plain. 
The Sakas


Another incoming Central Asian ethnic group were the Scythians, 
known in India as the Sakas. They pushed their way into 
northwestern India and beyond the Indus into western India starting 
from the 2nd century B.C.E. One branch historians call the Western 
Sakas gradually conquered much of today’s Gujarat and Rajasthan. 


The Sakas fought perennially against the Satavahanas, who ruled 
the Deccan and stood high in Brahmanic Hindu society. The Saka 
king Rudraman I (r. 130–150 C.E.) gave one of his daughters to the 
Satavahana king as a bride. 


This created a political marriage alliance. In Indian cultural terms, 
it showed both Rudradaman’s acceptance of the social and political 
superiority of his Satavahana son-in-law and also Satavahana 
acceptance of the Sakas as Hindus. 

A History of India

Assimilation


Various Saka clans and other settling ethnic groups began to 
assimilate into Indian Hindu society. This was usually a gradual, 
multistage process. 


The nature of the so-called caste system of Varnas and jatis meant 
that clans could live amidst other groups while not dining or 
intermarrying with them. But gradually they connected themselves 
more with the local society. In doing this, some former outsider 
groups began to take on social and cultural characteristics recognized 
locally as Kshatriya. 


The martial, often ruling jati of Rajputs, literally “sons of kings,” 
was both accepted as part of the Kshatriya Varna and also as a status 
into which powerful outsiders could assimilate. This is the process 
known by social scientists as Sanskritization, since Sanskrit is the 
sacred language of Brahmins. 


Outsiders also sometimes enhanced their identification by themselves 
and others as Rajputs through a two-stage process of intermarriage. 
First, the former outsiders would use their political power and 
economic resources to convince already recognized Rajput families 
in the region to accept brides from them. (Since brides customarily 
married upward, the bride giver recognized the social superiority of 
the bride receiver.)


The next step came when the former newcomers clearly had risen 
in power above already established Rajputs. Then they convinced 
the latter to give brides to them. This provided public proof that the 
former outsiders were now high-ranking Rajputs, standing above 
the bride givers.


As another component of this process of proving themselves Rajputs, 
the upwardly mobile clan often hired Brahmins. In exchange for 
payment and other patronage, these Brahmins would perform 
royal rituals that only Kshatriyas were supposed to be eligible for. 

Lecture 14—Northwest and North India 
115
Further, some Brahmins “discovered” their patron’s true genealogy 
as descended from a great Kshatriya ruler and, ultimately, from the 
sun, the moon, or from a sacred sacrificial fire.
The Guptas


Over the centuries following the fragmentation of the Mauryan 
Empire and the collapse of the Sunga dynasty, the Gangetic plain 
was the arena in which various regionally based dynasties arose, 
attempted to expand, and then either fragmented or shrank back to 
their core region. 


Eventually, the most prominent and successful of these were the 
Guptas. This dynasty arose from uncertain origins, established 
their regime in the still-wealthy Magadha region, and built an 
empire starting in the early 4th century C.E. The Gupta Empire 
lasted powerfully for 200 years in the face of recurrent invasions by 
Central Asians. 


Our attention is drawn to the Guptas not only for their political and 
military accomplishments but also because of the flourishing of 
Sanskrit and Hindu culture under their patronage. 


The Guptas began their rise to power when the dynamic Gupta 
general named Chandragupta I married into the Licchavi clan that 
was dominant near Magadha around 320 C.E. Once in control over 
the rich resources of Magadha, Chandragupta stood forth as a king 
and began a decade of conquests that his four successors would 
greatly extend over the next 200 years. 


In addition to being effective military commanders, the Guptas 
succeeded in their conquests by recruiting huge armies, mostly bow-
armed infantry. They also used elephants as war animals. 

A History of India
116


At its greatest extent, the Gupta Empire stretched over the entire 
Ganges plain. Tributary kings recognized Gupta overlord-ship as far 
west as the Indus River and as far south as Kanchipuram. 


The Guptas also made marriage alliances that extended their power. 
For example, in the 5th century, one Gupta princess, Prabhavati, 
married the current king of the Vakataka dynasty in the western 
Deccan. When her husband died, Prabhavati took over as regent, 
ruling that kingdom as a Gupta ally while her son grew up.


While the core of the Gupta Empire was in Magadha, they tried to 
buttress their administration in the western part of their regime by 
making the historically significant city of Ujjain their second capital. 


Especially in the Gupta capital cities, royal and other patrons 
sponsored authors of Sanskrit literature. The two great Hindu epics, 
the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, reached their final and most 
polished form under the Guptas. 


Although the Guptas favored the worship of the Hindu god Vishnu, 
they also patronized Buddhism. Several Chinese pilgrims who 
traveled through the Gupta Empire in search of the original teachings 
of the Buddha noted the extensive system of Buddhist monasteries. 


For a century, the Gupta Empire repulsed repeated assaults by Central 
Asian Huns from the northwest. But the Gupta dynasty was drained 
of resources from this constant warfare and finally collapsed by 550.
After the Guptas


Over the following century, dozens of rival, regionally based 
dynasties fought to survive and expand in north India as further 
martial immigrations came from the northwest. One king, Harsha, 
emerged out of this melee and briefly created an empire that echoed 
Gupta accomplishments. 

Lecture 14—Northwest and North India 
117


Harsha’s family had been locally prominent as rulers of Thanesar. 
Harsha got his chance at roughly age 16 when his older brother was 
assassinated around. Harsha therefore inherited their father’s small 
kingdom around the year 606. 


Then Harsha defeated the assassins of his sister’s late husband, 
who was ruler of a larger and more significant kingdom, based in 
Kannauj. With that as his base for his half-century long reign, Harsha 
led ever-growing armies against his neighbors in all directions, 
including still-wealthy Magadha, which provided him with even 
more resources of men and materiel. 


Harsha’s triumphs reached their southern limit, however, when he 
tried to invade the Deccan around 630. That campaign overextended 
his forces, and he lost to the Chalukyas, a series of rulers who had 
eventually largely succeeded to the territories earlier ruled by the 
Satavahanas. 


In part, we know so much more about King Harsha than about his 
many rivals because of the literature, including historical accounts, 
that flourished under his patronage. One of Harsha’s courtiers, the 
poet Bana, was a brilliant Brahmin praise singer. 

A History of India
118


He glorified his patron by composing a literary biography in Sanskrit 
entitled Harshacharita, or The Deeds of Harsha, which begins with 
Harsha’s miraculous conception and birth and ends with him about 
to begin his glorious reign of conquest. Despite this supernatural 
account of Harsha’s origins and early reign, this text still preserves 
for us valuable knowledge of the culture of Harsha’s court and his 
historical context.


Yet more knowledge about Harsha’s reign comes from the Chinese 
pilgrims who passed through his kingdoms seeking to find Buddhist 
texts and relics. But a later Chinese visitor, Wang Xuance, an 
ambassador from the Tang Emperor who reached Kannauj in 647, 
found Harsha’s throne had been usurped by his minister. This both 
gives us a termination date for his reign and indicates that Harsha’s 
heirs proved unable to hold on to his throne.


Instead, the northwest and the Ganges region experienced centuries 
of brief conquests by a series of warrior-kings. Among these were 
Rajputs (perhaps originally Sakas) who spread across north India 
from the 8th through the 10th centuries. 


One king from Kashmir, Lalitaditya Muktapida, briefly conquered 
much of north India between 724–760. Other powerful kings fought 
their way up the Ganges from Bengal while yet others made incursions 
north from the Deccan. However, rarely could any conquering dynasty 
hold a transregional state together for more than one reign.

Lecture 15
Brahmanic Synthesis
T
o survive and flourish, religions and their leaders must adapt 
to changing circumstances while seeking to retain their core 
principles. Over the long period from the 3rd century B.C.E. to the 
8th century C.E., Brahmins gradually built up their prominence in Indian 
society. To do so, they made their models of and for the universe and 
society into what is today called Hinduism. In this process, Brahmins 
absorbed many of the most attractive features of their rivals, particularly 
Jainism, Buddhism, and popular movements centered on particular gods 
and goddesses. 
Adaptations


From the 3rd century B.C.E. onward, the new religions of Jainism and 
Buddhism taught nonviolence and alternative paths to the Vedic 
model based on sacrifice. These newer religions attracted kings of 
non-royal origin, especially the Mauryan emperors, as well as rising 
classes in Indian society, particularly merchants.


Brahmins, for their part, strengthened their religious leadership. 
They expanded upon the sacred Veda, which had, in etic terms, been 
compiled starting over a millennium earlier. Society had changed 
greatly as Vedic pastoralists largely settled down to become farmers 
or town or city dwellers starting around 500 B.C.E. 


The specific words of the Veda no longer related to their lives. Vedic 
Sanskrit had become an archaic language. Even educated people 
spoke a later form of Sanskrit or a Sanskrit-derived language. As 
a result, Brahmin teachers increasingly interpreted the Veda into 
ways that the vast majority of the population of India found more 
compelling. 

A History of India
120


Brahmins coopted some of popular devotionalism, called bhakti. 
They highlighted specific Hindu gods and goddesses as objects of 
puja, or worship. Brahmins proved especially successful under rich, 
powerful, and culturally sophisticated patrons like the Gupta Empire 
of the 4th to 6th centuries C.E.


Since many of the core features of what we call Hinduism 
consolidated during this period, we’ll use that term from now 
onward, although it is somewhat anachronistic to do so since the 
term was not actually used widely until much later in India’s history.
The Shastras


Over many centuries, Brahmin scholars composed in the Sanskrit 
of their day a series of formal teachings, or shastras. These teachings 
linked the Veda with explanations and rules for most aspects of living 
people’s lives. 


The major shastras were composed as Brahmins successfully re-
exerted influence the hearts and minds of most Indians. The shastras 
are emically classed as Smrti, that is, “remembered knowledge,” or 
“tradition,” the product of divinely inspired but human authors. 
This genre is therefore less sacred than the Veda, which is regarded as 
uncreated truth—the universe in sound form. The teacher-authors of 
these shastras did not all agree, so there are often different versions 
of the same shastra. 


In its model structure, each shastra begins with devout students 
reverently approaching their semi-divine teacher with a deep 
question. The dharma shastra, for instance, has students wanting to 
know the origin of each of the four Varnas and of the thousands of 
jatis, and the duties, dharma, for men and women in each of these.


In response to his students’ questions, the semi-divine teacher then 
elaborates, based on his complete comprehension of the Veda. The 
teacher thus provides commentary that makes the lessons relevant to 

Lecture 15—Brahmanic Synthesis 
121
the contemporary society and concerns of his students. This question 
and response is a powerful rhetorical strategy used by many cultures 
around the world. 


To illustrate what the shastras say, and how they convey their 
teachings, we’ll look at the three main Brahmanic shastras. These 
present, first, the science of morality—dharma—second, the 
science of material power—artha—and third, the science of sensual 
pleasure—kama. When applied expertly, each of these sciences leads 
to moksha, that is, release from the cycle of rebirth and re-death. 
The Dharma Shastra


Dharma stands as the highest path toward moksha. It is also the path 
that its authors and audience have found most widely relevant since 
it addresses many of the social patterns and tensions of its era. 


As with the other shastras, there were many versions of the dharma 
shastra. The version that has become most widely used is attributed 
to a legendary semi-divine figure, Manu.


The dharma shastra provides room for all three Brahmin turns 
of life—the householder, the forest dweller, and the wandering 
ascetic—honoring each. To do so, the shastra prescribes different 
ashrama, or life stages. Each ashrama is initiated by a specific rite 
of passage, a samskara, which transforms one into the next stage or 
level of existence.


In the classic dharma shastra model, children do not have full 
status as members of human society until they have been initiated. 
This initiation was the major rite of donning of a sacred thread that 
makes one “twice born.” This sacred thread is a ritually constructed 
white cotton cord around the torso, draped from the left shoulder 
across the chest and back, with the lowest portion at the right 
waist. Once donned, this sacred thread has to be kept pure and 
periodically renewed. 

A History of India
122


Ages for receiving the thread vary, but the standard for a Brahmin 
boy is eight years after birth; for a Kshatriya boy, it’s age 11, and for 
a Vaishya, it’s age 12. Only male Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas 
are eligible. Today in India, twice-born men total only about 10 
percent of the population.


Once initiated, a twice-born man should study the Veda under a 
worthy Brahmin teacher, called a guru, meaning someone heavy with 
knowledge. The student must remain celibate, live on food given 
freely by donors, and be fully obedient in the service of his teacher. 


Some devote much of their lives in this student stage of life. The 
shastra prescribes 36 of Vedic study as ideal, but other students pass 
through this stage much more rapidly—some in just a matter of 
hours.


The dharma shastra prescribes the next major rite of passage, 
marriage, for men and women of all Varnas. Hence, it is the second 
samskara for twice-born men but the first for everyone else.
Householders


Since the ashrama of householder is a mandatory stage of life for all 
people, the shastra ranks it as the vital foundation for society. The 
householder produces children, especially sons, who perpetuate the 
father’s lineage. The twice-born householder also performs the Vedic 
rituals that sustain the universe and human society as well. 


Much of the dharma shastra is devoted to prescribing the ideal life 
for a householder. As the shastra’s authors do throughout, they 
especially address a male Brahmin audience. It is clear, in etic terms, 
that Brahmins incorporated many of the most persuasive features of 
the rival Jain and Buddhist traditions. 


Among these was to regard nonviolence highly. The shastra forbids 
animal sacrifices, and instead prescribes the offering of clarified 

Lecture 15—Brahmanic Synthesis 
123
butter called ghee, fruits, flowers, and other plant products. People 
dedicated their devotion to particular gods, especially Shiva or his 
family or Vishnu and his incarnations. This made the puja more 
personal and less formulaic. 


Since some acts of violence could easily be incurred by living in the 
world, the shastra provides three means of expiation of the negative 
effects of those acts. First, the person can cleanse him or herself. 
Second, if the person does not do the expiation, then the king should 
punish him or her instead. Third, if a person dies with the bad karma 
unpurged, then the consequence will be a birth at a lower level. 
For instance, the authors of the shastra declare that a Brahmin who 
drinks spirituous liquor enter the body of an insect, a bird feeding on 
ordure, or a destructive beast. 
Final Stages


Once a householder has secured his lineage, when his sons 
themselves have sons, he can voluntarily enter the optional next 
stage of life as a forest dweller. In this stage, he begins to withdraw 
his senses and his involvements with society. Women could also 
enter this stage of life, although the shastra does not discuss their 
doing so very extensively.


In the dharma shastra, there is a final optional stage, one that leads 
directly toward moksha. This stage comes after one’s symbolic 
cremation, a ritual that symbolically ends one’s social identity. In this 
final stage of life, one wanders homelessly, without any family ties, 
eating only when fed, neither desiring life nor desiring death. 
Artha Shastra


The artha shastra deals with the second highest ranked path of 
material power and wealth. While Brahmins claimed precedence 
in ritual terms, during this post-Vedic period kings and merchants 
had been rising. Much of the support for Jainism and Buddhism 

A History of India
124
came from those rising classes, so some Brahmins compiled the 
artha shastra to address the concerns and dharma of those classes in 
particular. 


Credit for this text later went to a Brahmin, Chanakya of the Kautilya 
clan, who had reportedly masterminded the rise of the first Mauryan 
emperor around 320 B.C.E. But internal evidence indicates that the 
most prominent version of the artha shastra was compiled hundreds 
of years after Chanakya’s death. As we discussed in the lecture on 
the origins of the Mauryan Empire, etic historians have found unique 
source material about that empire in this shastra.


The artha shastra focuses mostly on the role of king, but this shastra 
also provides rich evidence about how its authors envisioned the 
households of the expanding middle and upper classes, especially 
those living in the burgeoning cities of that post Vedic era. 


For example, this shastra prescribes the highest ranked of type of 
wedding as one in which the bride’s parents give a dowry, including 
jewelry. Unlike dowry customs in India today, in this shastra, the 
bride retained much authority and control over that wealth. But 
there are also limits set by the shastra about the extent a woman 
could move about in public without incurring a fine from the state. 
The Kama Shastra


The third major shastra also deals with key parts of society. This is the 
kama shastra, sometimes known as the Kama Sutra. Kama means the 
pleasurable relationship between the material world and a person as 
experienced through the senses. Here, as with the other two paths to 
moksha, the goal is to perform masterfully the duties appropriate to 
one’s social identity but with total non-attachment. 


The kama shastra addresses a more limited audience. It specifies 
that young urban men and women should study its teachings for 
a cultivated life of pleasure. But courtesans are the special focus, 

Lecture 15—Brahmanic Synthesis 
125
since their livelihood depends on their mastery of its principles 
and practices. 


For a courtesan, or indeed any women, the shastra prescribes training 
and mastery of the classical 64 arts. These include a vast range of 
expertise, from singing, playing a variety of instruments, gymnastics, 
and magic, to cooking, carpentry, architecture, and chemistry. 


Other parts in this shastra detail the arts of seduction, titillation of 
one’s partner, and the ideal types of kissing, touching, and sexual 
intercourse. These last sections have attracted much international 
attention, but there are also many misconceptions about it. As 
with all the shastras, the purpose of the kama shastra is to enable 
a devoted and dispassionate practitioner of its sciences, someone 
who is in complete control over the senses, to achieve moksha, 
never to be born again.

Lecture 16
Indian Parsis, Jews, and Christians
S
uperficial impressions of India may make it seem like a Hindu 
nation or, at most, a Hindu nation with a substantial Muslim 
minority. But Indian society has long been more diverse than that. 
Numerous minority communities with their own particular religious and 
cultural traditions have for many centuries lived as parts of Indian society, 
identifiably separate and yet extensively interacting with the majority. 
Some of these minority communities originated and have developed 
within India, like the Jains and Buddhists. But other minority communities 
originally came from outside of India. Such groups include the Parsis, 
Jews, and early Christians in India whom we will discuss in this lecture. 
The Parsis


Much of the distinctiveness of the Parsi community comes from 
its ancient tradition in Iran. The ancient sage Zoroaster founded a 
religious tradition that for many centuries dominated there. He taught 
that there is a constant conflict between the forces of good on one hand 
and those of evil on the other. He also taught that humans should 
respect the purity of the three prime elements: fire, water, and earth. 


Until the coming of Islam in the 8th century, Zoroastrianism was 
the state religion of Iran’s Sassanian Empire. According to the emic 
history recounted by Zoroastrians in India, when Islam arrived, they 
fled in order to remain true to their faith. They found refuge in the 
trading ports of the Gujarat region of India. 


According to the most commonly told version of their origin, these 
refugees were at first refused entry by the local Hindu king. He 
showed them a bowl filled to the brim with milk. The message was 

Lecture 16—Indian Parsis, Jews, and Christians 
127
that nothing more could be added without the bowl—symbolically 
his kingdom—overflowing. 


But when the Zoroastrians sprinkled sugar on the milk, it was 
absorbed without causing an overflow and added sweetness. The 
then accepted the Zoroastrians under five specific conditions:


They should explain their beliefs to the king. 


They should abandon their own language, Parsi or Persian, and 
adopt the local language, Gujarati. 


Their womenfolk should wear Gujarati-style clothing, with the 
sari wrapped in a distinctive way so that the end comes over the 
right shoulder and drapes over the chest. 


Their menfolk should disarm and live peacefully as merchants. 


They should not disturb the indigenous population with 
wedding processions during the daytime. 


Etic scholars interpret this account as revealing both how the Parsis 
actually reached and settled in India, and how they explain their 
origins to themselves. Scholars believe that, instead of arriving as 
refugees, Parsis were actually part of a long-standing trade diaspora 
network throughout the Indian Ocean, especially linking Iran and 
India. 


The five conditions all justify why the Parsi culture looks so similar 
to the local Gujarati Hindu one, at least outwardly. While they are to 
explain their beliefs to those who wish to listen, they are not to force 
it upon others through warlike behavior or intruding on their social 
space with processions. 


Although this is not sanctioned by Zoroastrian doctrine, three 
distinct social classes have developed. These function much like 
Hindu Varnas. The highest are the hereditary priests. Then there 
is the general Parsi community, who have predominantly been 
merchants. The lowest group are the people who carry the dead into 
the Towers of Silence and prepare them for dismemberment there. 

A History of India
128


As outward-looking merchants, centered in the commercial ports 
of Surat and later Bombay (today Mumbai), the Parsis were 
among the most successful communities during the period of 
European colonialism. Parsis adapted quickly and effectively to the 
opportunities that these Europeans opened up. 


Some of the leading corporations in India today, like the Tata Group, 
were started by Parsis who adapted to business opportunities in 
India and then the larger world. They often combined commercial 
acumen with a sense of social responsibility, so there are many 
philanthropic institutions and organizations started and run by 
Parsis.


But the Parsi community has been shrinking over the last century. 
More educated Parsi youth marry late, marry outside the community, 
or do not marry at all. They have fewer children. At present, there 
are only about 60,000 Parsis in India, and they are aging, with a third 
of the entire community over age 60. 
The Cochin Jews


The oldest of the three major Jewish communities in India was located 
along the southwest coast, especially in the port city of Cochin (now 
renamed Kochi, in the Indian province of Kerala). There was a well-
established, and at times prosperous, settlement there since ancient 
times. 


Later ethnographic research shows that this Cochin-based 
community developed two subgroups. One kept the name pardesi, 
meaning “foreigners.” They claimed direct descent from Yemeni 
Jewish people and appeared largely of that genetic heritage. 


Ranked below them were people who became known as the Black 
Jews. They also claim direct Jewish descent. But there is etic evidence 
that they have mixed Indian and Yemeni ancestry or only Indian 
ancestry. 

Lecture 16—Indian Parsis, Jews, and Christians 
129


The Cochin Jewish community reached its economic peak during the 
period when the Abbasid Caliphate, based in Baghdad, flourished 
for the five centuries starting in 750 C.E. 


As the Abbasid Caliphate expanded its authority over the northern 
and western shores of the Indian Ocean coast during the 9th and 10th 
centuries, it created conditions that fostered prosperity for merchant 
communities trading there, including the Cochin Jews. The caliphs 
minted uniform gold and silver coins and created communication 
systems, which increased the market’s effectiveness. 


But the Mongols destroyed Baghdad in 1258. With the collapse of 
the Abbasid system, the prosperity of the Cochin Jews in Kerala 
declined.
The Baghdadi Jews


The second major center for Jews in India was the trading center in 
Bengal. There they became known as Baghdadi Jews because they 
came overland from Iraq, through Iran, and across Afghanistan and 
north India. 


They sent their sons to yeshivas in Baghdad, where they formed 
networks that would prove mutually beneficial for international 
trade as the former students returned to their trade diaspora 
communities around the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal.


Much artisanal production, especially handspun and handwoven 
cotton and silk cloth, concentrated in Bengal. Merchants throughout 
north India brought raw materials and finished products down the 
Ganges River, where Jewish and other traders shipped it overseas. 


They also purchased products arriving from southeast Asia and 
China. Thus, these merchant communities prospered from the 
extensive commerce that flowed in and out of the Bay of Bengal.

A History of India
130
The Bene Israel


The third major Jewish community settled on the upper western 
coast of India. This community became known as the Bene Israel. 
Their origins are disputed. Many in the community claim direct 
descent from the Jewish biblical tribes. But many outsiders propose 
one or another later arrival date for their arrival in India. They may 
have been a branch of the Cochin Jews. 


They seem to have settled first in Surat (now in the Indian province 
of Gujarat), which was a long-standing trading center. After the 
Surat port silted up, many moved to the new British trading outpost 
of Bombay. The oldest active Bene Israel synagogue in present-day 
Mumbai dates from 1796, during the period when the English East 
India Company governed Bombay. 


Since the Bene Israel lived in the thriving British-ruled port of 
Bombay, they lasted longer than the other two Jewish communities 
in India. However, when Indian and, more importantly, Israeli 
independence came in 1947 and 1948 respectively, most Jewish 
people immigrated to Israel. 

Lecture 16—Indian Parsis, Jews, and Christians 
131


The total number of Jewish people in India declined rapidly. In 
1947, there were about 17,000 Bene Israel, 6,000 Baghdadi, and 2,000 
Cochin Jews in India. Today, the total number is about 5,000, mostly 
Bene Israel. 
Syrian Christians


The third community that we’ll consider in this lecture is made up 
of people known as Syrian Christians, since they follow the Syrian 
Nestorian form of Christianity and have Syriac as their liturgical 
language. 


The Nestorians were a branch of Christianity that had split off over 
doctrinal issues in the 5th–6th centuries and based themselves in 
Persia and Syria. The Syrian Christians who settled in India were an 
eastern outpost of this distinctive branch of Christianity. 


Like the Cochin Jews, they are concentrated along India’s southwest 
coast. They also have several emic origin stories. The most 
prestigious account of their origins includes personal conversion by 
St. Thomas, one of Jesus’s 12 apostles. Another emic origin account 
has a merchant, Thomas of Cana, doing the conversion. 


Scholars highlight the biological ancestry of this community. They 
describe a process like what we saw for Jews: merchants who came 
from the west across the Indian Ocean interacted with local Indian 
people and established families with them. 


The merchants among them prospered from their overseas 
commercial networks in the Indian Ocean, and as far east as 
Indonesia. They also benefited from the authority of the Abbasid 
Caliphs, and the earliest European merchants who began to arrive by 
sea around Africa from the early 16th century. 


The Syrian Christian community also had and continues to have 
more extensive roles within Indian society. They speak the local

language, Malayalam. Many fulfill ritual roles like those of Brahmins, 
being approached by people, Hindus as well as Christians, who want 
purification. Many other Syrian Christians were prominent soldiers 
who served Hindu kings in the region. 


Outside social scientists also see how Syrian Christians adapted 
preexisting religious institutions. For example, St. Thomas Mount 
appears to have been a religious shrine before the Christian era. It 
sits atop a prominent 300-foot-high hill, the kind of place that would 
be considered sacred in many cultures.


As their numbers rose, Syrian Christians established inland pepper 
plantations and trading links that stretched into the interior. They 
also seem to have intermarried with the powerful Nayar Hindu 
community of warriors and landholders, some of whom converted 
to Christianity. Leading Syrian Christian families held prominent 
positions as donors to major Hindu shrines, temples, and festivals. 


By the mid-17th century, there were a reported 200,000 Syrian 
Christian families in Kerala. The 1871 census confirms this scale, 
counting about half a million Syrian Christians, which made them a 
majority of the total population in particular districts of Kerala. 


When Roman Catholic Portuguese explorers and commanders began 
to reach India directly from 1498 onward, they regarded the Syrian 
Christians first as potential allies but later as heretics. The Portuguese 
had been searching in the for the kingdom of the legendary Prester 
John, and some thought that the Syrian Christians might be it. 


Further, as powerful warriors and landholders, with strong 
connections with the society and economy of the Kerala region, these 
Syrian Christians appeared to the Portuguese to be useful clients. 
There were some early benefits to both sides. But as the Portuguese 
established their own chain of coastal enclaves in India, they needed 
the Syrian Christians less. 

Lecture 16—Indian Parsis, Jews, and Christians



The Portuguese took over the shrine to St. Thomas, building a 
Catholic church under their control there in 1523. They discovered 
bones there that they proclaimed those of the saint himself. A few 
decades later, the Portuguese increased their pressure on the Syrian 
Christians to convert to Roman Catholicism. Many did so, but others 
did not. These tensions between Europeans as new outsiders and 
Indian people would persist as European colonialism began to assert 
itself over India.

Lecture 17
Islam Comes to India
S
outh Asia has the largest number of Muslims in the whole world, 
about a third of the entire total. There are over half a billion Muslims 
in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. In this lecture, we’ll consider 
the several different historical ways by which so many South Asians 
became Muslim. We’ll divide these overlapping and complex patterns of 
conversion to Islam into three broad types. First, we’ll focus on coastal 
communities. Then, we’ll look at how Muslim holy men inspired large 
numbers of Indians to convert to Islam. Finally, we’ll consider ways that 
Muslim rulers and other warriors who entered South Asia established 
kingdoms and empires, at first in the north and then gradually across 
most of the subcontinent. 
Basics of Islam


Orthodox Islamic theology asserts a single core creed: there is no 
God but Allah, and Muhammad is his final prophet. The foundation 
of religious authority on earth for Muslims comes from the Quran 
and the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. 


Key practices, often known as the five pillars of Islam, are supposed 
to be shared by all Muslims. In addition to the Islamic core creed, the 
other four pillars are: 


Ritual prayer at set times during the day and always oriented to 
a cubical building within Mecca, the Kaaba 


Fasting during daylight hours, which all observant Muslims 
(except those who are pregnant, travelling, or ill) should respect 
during the lunar month of Ramadan 


The hajj, or ritual filled pilgrimage to Mecca, during the 
appropriate holy month

Lecture 17—Islam Comes to India 
135


The pillar of alms, in which the common wealth of the entire 
Muslim community is expressed through charitable giving


In practice, some people born to Muslim parents are not very 
religious themselves, so we should differentiate between Muslim 
people ethnically and Islam as a religion. 


The Muslim community, which began in the Arabian Peninsula in 
the 7th century, rapidly spread across much of Africa and Asia. Arabic 
remains the sacred language of the Quran, of formal prayer, and 
of many important Islamic texts. But Islam has proven persuasive 
around the world to people who continue to speak their own 
languages. Islam is open to converts: Anyone who submits to Allah 
thereby becomes a Muslim. 
Coastal Communities


One important way by which people in India came to become 
Muslims centers on the Indian Ocean trade. This trade has continued 
for over 2,000 years, ever since seamen and merchants recognized 
how the seasonal monsoon winds could aid them. 

A History of India
136


While these winds were predictable, they also required merchants 
and seamen to make only one round-trip cycle per year. This meant 
Arabs and east Africans often spent long months in Indian ports 
waiting for the monsoon winds to reverse. 


Often, such extended visits meant that these seamen and merchants 
formed relationships with local Indian families. Some visitors 
married Indian women, had children with them, and established 
their own families in these ports. 


After the 7th-century founding of Islam, many of these visiting Arab 
merchants and seamen themselves converted to Islam. The status of 
such visitors as Muslims then influenced their friends and families 
in India. 


Similarly, when Muslim holy men called Sufis traveled to coastal 
India, they also sometimes married local women. The children of 
such Indian-Muslim families carried on some of the traditions from 
each side of their ancestry. Some of these Indian-Muslim communities 
became known as Mappila, meaning “son-in-law,” since they derived 
their identities from outside men who joined the Indian family.
The Sufis


The second of the three broad ways by which Muslim communities 
emerged in South Asia was through the actions and influences of the 
Sufis. 


From early on in Islam, some Muslims sought direct experience of 
God. Such Sufi seekers sometimes found that the prescribed duties 
for Muslims of prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, and alms sharing were not 
enough. Some even found such mundane duties to be distractions 
from their personal devotion to Allah. 


From among these devotees emerged especially powerful saints 
or other holy figures, including a few holy women. Leading Sufis 

Lecture 17—Islam Comes to India 
137
gradually formed religious orders, in which the charismatic founder 
inspired many and passed on his wisdom and spiritual power to 
chosen successors, sometimes a son, other times a leading disciple. 


Gradually, from the 11th century onward, Sufis began immigrating to 
spread their spiritual message in India. Eventually, Sufis extended 
their beliefs widely across India, and settled down in many different 
regions. Often, they were themselves inspired by Indian bhakti ways 
of personal devotion to the divine. 


Many South Asian individuals and communities responded to these 
Sufis by accepting their religious messages, which often reinforced 
their own spiritual traditions. Since some Sufis were so eclectic, some 
of their ways of reaching and expressing their love of the divine were 
amalgamations of Muslim and Hindu forms of worship. 


Some Sufis and their disciples also carried with them more practical 
expertise that would enable their local Indian supporters to prosper. 
One example occurred in the upper Indus region known as the 
Punjab, where the land tended to be arid and unable to support 
settled agriculture through rainfall alone. Many people there were 
herders whose grazing animals required less surface water. 


Sufis who came from Iran and Central Asia were familiar with irrigation 
practices that had been developed in those lands. These included the 
Persian waterwheel, where a series of buckets driven by a gearing 
system and powered by draft animals could raise a large volume of 
underground water to the surface. With the construction of such new 
irrigation methods, herders in the western Punjab in particular could 
settle as farmers, often clustering around a Sufi hospice or shrine. 


Over in the eastern region of Bengal, much of the land was still 
heavily forested, so many Adivasi people living there followed 
swidden agriculture. After Sufis and their followers arrived, these 
local communities learned to master the metal technology of steel axes 
and plowshares that enabled them to cut down and uproot large trees. 

A History of India
138


For thousands of years, river networks have eroded silt from the 
Himalayan mountains and north Indian plain and deposited it as 
Bengal’s rich deltaic soil. Therefore, once cleared of forests, these 
lands could be very richly productive.


The people of this region also learned methods of intensive wet-rice 
agriculture, which is somewhat complicated but highly productive. 
With the knowledge brought by Sufis and their followers, many 
Bengalis, particularly in the eastern part of that region, cleared the 
trees, settled, and prospered as wet-rice farmers. 


Their communities grew more numerous and simultaneously 
converted to Islam. As in the Punjab, many of these converts carried 
with them their pre-Islamic ideas and followed eclectic combinations 
of Hindu and Muslim customs and beliefs. 
Muslim Rulers


The third broad way that South Asians became Muslims was 
through the influences and effects of Muslim rulers who invaded 
and established kingdoms in several Indian regions. 


From its earliest days, the Muslim community in Arabia sought to 
defend itself and also expand by force, persuasion, and conversion. 
In 711, an Arab general, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim captured Sind, the 
region around the mouth of the Indus River. This was less than a 
century after the emergence of Islam. 


Sind has remained under Muslim rulers virtually ever since. Sind 
now forms the second most populous province in Pakistan. Sind’s 
main port of Karachi is Pakistan’s largest city and its economic 
powerhouse.


A few hundred years later, Muslim rulers based in Afghanistan or 
Central Asia began to invade India by land from the northwest. 
India was such a rich land that some Muslim rulers made repeated 

Lecture 17—Islam Comes to India 
139
incursions. In particular, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni (in today’s 
Afghanistan) conducted a series of 17 raids between 998 and 1130. 


More influentially, starting in 1206 and lasting for 300 years, a series 
of five Muslim dynasties made Delhi their capital. Expanding out 
from Delhi, they conquered much of north and central India. 


Most of these rulers came from Afghanistan and Central Asia. But 
these regimes tended to be very fragile, with their governors and 
military commanders breaking off to form independent kingdoms of 
their own, especially in the central Indian Deccan and in the eastern 
region of Bengal. 


Thus, while some of the most expansive of the Delhi sultans, like 
the early 14th-century Muhammad bin Tughluq, managed to briefly 
conquer most of India, none of these five dynasties ever succeeded in 
creating a stable or long-lasting empire. 


In contrast, the Muslim Mughal dynasty from Central Asia 
eventually defeated the last of the Delhi sultans and gradually 
established one of the world’s wealthiest, most powerful, and most 
extensive empires. 


Some Muslim rulers rewarded those of their employees and subjects 
who became Muslims. Indeed, a substantial number of the Indian 
warriors, officials, artists, and workers who served these Muslim 
rulers converted to Islam, out of conviction or practicality. 


Many of the families, clans, and communities who became Muslims 
also carried with them much of their pre-Islamic culture, including 
their social status and their family traditions and customs.


Some hereditary landholding clans in north India and the Deccan 
came to include both Muslims and Hindus simultaneously. They 
evidently decided that those of their members who interacted with 
these Muslim rulers should become Muslims. But others of these 

A History of India
140
same landholding clans remained Hindu, particularly those who 
dealt with their Hindu tenants and employees. 


One of the issues faced by all Muslim rulers in India was the legal 
status of the vast majority of their subjects who remained non-
Muslim. Within Islamic doctrine, some non-Muslim communities 
can hold status as dhimmi, protected subjects. 


Often, in exchange for this status, these non-Muslims must pay a 
special tax, called jizya. But to qualify for this protected status, many 
Muslim legal scholars and theologians claim that Allah must have 
chosen a prophet from that community to receive the Quran. 


The Quran itself specifically mentions earlier prophets, including 
Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. But there is no evidence in the 
Quran that Hindus were ever chosen by Allah to have a prophet. 
Consequently, some rigorously orthodox Muslim scholars assert 
that Hindus cannot legally be protected subjects. Yet, since Hindus 
formed the massive majority of people under virtually all the 
Muslim rulers in India, most of these rulers allowed them protected 
status anyway.
Three Nations


By surveying these three broad ways that various communities 
in South Asia converted to Islam, we can begin to see why they 
eventually formed three different nations. 


In 1947, the large concentrations of Muslims in the northwest and in 
the east became West and East Pakistan. But the cultural and historic 
differences between the people of these two wings of Pakistan, 
separated by a thousand miles, contributed to their breaking apart 
in 1971. 


East Pakistan seceded and became the independent republic of 
Bangladesh. What had been West Pakistan became all of Pakistan, 

Lecture 17—Islam Comes to India 
141
with the Punjab and Sind as its two largest provinces, collectively 
constituting about three-quarters of the entire national population. 


Within the constitutionally secular Republic of India, about 
14  percent of the population is Muslim, making them the largest 
minority community in that nation. But these Muslim communities 
are diverse and geographically spread across India, with one of the 
largest concentrations in Kerala, where the Mapillas emerged, and 
another in the heartland of the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire.

Lecture 18
Indian Sultans
O
ften, the history of the Indian subcontinent over the past 
millennium has been seen in terms of religious conflict, particularly 
Muslims versus Hindus. But a binary division between Muslims 
and Hindus greatly oversimplifies the complex interactions among diverse 
and overlapping Indian communities. This lecture looks at the first eight 
centuries of Muslim rule over parts of South Asia so that we can explore 
some of these processes. The lecture also describes several shifts in power 
between various rulers.
Muslim and Hindu Activities


By 711, conquesting Muslims had reached Sind in the lower 
Indus plain. An army under Muhammad bin al-Qasim created an 
extension of the Islamic caliphate there. Relatively few Muslims 
actually ever immigrated, and gradually this became more of an 
Indian-based sultanate. This sultanate made itself independent of 
the caliphate by 985.


Various Hindu rulers largely contained expeditions over the next 
century by Sind’s sultans up the Indus River plain. Many of these 
rulers were Rajputs, who were themselves trying to expand in the 
Indus River plain. 


Since the death of the Indian ruler Harsha in 647, there had been no 
single dominant stable empire in India. Instead, various rival Hindu-
ruled kingdoms fought bitterly against each other, even as trade and 
commerce generally expanded.


Meanwhile, from the 8th century onward, Muslim rulers had 
expanded overland across Iran and established themselves in what 

Lecture 18—Indian Sultans 
143
is today Afghanistan. The most aggressive of these sought to conduct 
raids even more distant raids into the richer lands of India. Scholars 
have identified over ninety distinct military clashes involving 
Muslim and Indian non-Muslim rulers during the period between 
636 and 1205. 


However, that is only one clash every six years. The number is also 
misleading since many of there were undertaken by a single ruler, 
Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, who was responsible for 17 of those 
clashes.	


Next, the Ghurid clan seized power in Afghanistan and continued 
this pattern of raids into India. By the end of the 12th century, 
Muhammad Ghuri had conquered Sind and territory as far east as 
Bengal. The speed of his warhorses enabled them to outflank the 
elephant-centered forces of his Indian opponents.
Mamluks


These Afghan rulers relied heavily on a system of military and 
administrative slaves. They captured or purchased young boys, 
often from the nomadic Turkish communities who migrated around 
Central Asia. These rulers then raised and trained these slaves to be 
loyal warriors. 


The most skilled of the slaves became generals, with many of their 
officers and soldiers also being slaves. When these slave generals 
captured territories, their owner and ruler often entrusted them 
with governing those lands. These kind of slaves were in the Islamic 
world known as mamluks. They also became prominent in Egypt 
during the period from 1250 to 1517.


The advantages for the ruler of this system of military-administrative 
slavery included his capacity to expand greatly the body of men loyal 
to him. In contrast, using the ruler’s own sons as his commanders 
and governors had limitations. He could not increase the number of 

A History of India
144
them very rapidly, no matter how much he tried. Further, sons often 
challenged their father, trying to overthrow him and take over the 
throne themselves. 
Qutbuddin Aibak and Successors


Muhammad Ghuri ordered his slave general Qutbuddin Aibak to 
command the key fortified outpost at Delhi. This was a longtime 
strategic location on the Jamuna River, which is the western 
boundary of the Ganges River plain. 


From Delhi, armies commanded by Qutbuddin and manned by his 
fellow slaves roamed widely, collecting spoils that he then passed on 
to his owner, Muhammad Ghuri, until the latter’s death in 1206. 


Thereafter, Qutbuddin held on to Delhi, obtained his personal 
freedom from the weak Ghurid successors, and proclaimed himself 
sultan. Qutbuddin and his band of mamluk generals then ruled 
collectively as the first of the five dynasties of the Delhi sultanate.


Qutbuddin was succeeded in 1211 as Sultan by another Turkish 
manumitted slave-general, Iltutmish. Having deposed the remaining 
Ghurid rulers in Afghanistan and Sind, Iltutmish sent gifts to the 
Abbasid caliph, asking for authorization for his own regime. 


Then, in 1221, a Mongol invasion by Genghis Khan ravished 
Afghanistan. Repeated Mongol invasions up to the Indus River over 
the next century kept Afghanistan weak while the Delhi Sultanate 
fought to repel them and rose in power. As the mamluk regime 
stabilized, it regularized their system of taxation on the surrounding 
region. 


When Iltutmish died of cancer in 1236, he tried to pass on his rule 
to his daughter, Raziyya. She was clearly a strong personality, but 
there was much opposition from the other mamluks who wanted 

Lecture 18—Indian Sultans 
145
Genghis Khan

A History of India
146
power for themselves. Finally, after four years of perilous rule, she 
was assassinated in 1240. 


In 1266, another Turk slave-commander, the ruthless Balban, killed 
the incumbent sultan, whose daughter he had married. Over the 
next two decades, Balban consolidated power in his own hands. 
Cut off from his Central Asian homeland, he increased the pace of 
Indianization. But without a clear line of dynastic descent, almost 
every succession among these mamluks led to battles among 
contenders, and no ruler could feel secure even in his own court.
The Tughluq Dynasty


The period of these Turkish slave-generals ended soon after Balban’s 
death, when the Khalji clan seized power in 1290. The Khaljis were 
Afghan-Turks who had settled in India. After only 30 years of rule, 
the Khaljis were overthrown by one of their own slave-commanders, 
who founded the Tughluq dynasty in 1320. For nearly a century, the 
Tughluqs held on to power in the sultanate. 


The most famous and dynamic in this Tughluq dynasty was 
Muhammad Tughluq. He seized the throne from his own father 
in 1325 and then ruled for a quarter century. He tried various 
innovations in order to expand and deepen his regime. He even re-
centered his kingdom by moving his capital over 750 miles south to 
a city he renamed Daulatabad. But this experiment failed, and he 
shifted his court back to Delhi again. 


We know much about life at the court, capital, and kingdom of 
Muhammad Tughluq from the richly detailed travel journal, or Rihla, of 
Ibn Battuta. He was a scholar from Morocco who traveled throughout 
the Islamic world, living for eight years in India, starting in 1333. 


When he reached Muhammad Tughluq’s court in Delhi, his prestige 
as a scholar from the Islamic west gained him an appointment as a 
judge of Islamic law. In addition, he was made the manager of the 

Lecture 18—Indian Sultans 
147
well-endowed mausoleum of an earlier Sultan. This endowment was 
the revenue from 30 villages. This more than paid for 460 attendants 
who worked under Ibn Battuta’s supervision. 


But Ibn Battuta lived beyond even this generous income. He ran 
up huge debts that he could not pay off. Instead, using his polished 
Arabic-language skills, he wrote a poem dedicated to Sultan 
Muhammad. Graciously, the sultan paid off the debt, and even 
gave Ibn Battuta much more. But the sultan was both generous and 
pitilessly arbitrary. Anyone who even slightly annoyed him was 
tortured and executed. 


Ibn Battuta decided that remaining at the Delhi court was too 
dangerous. He wished to find a gracious way of leaving and also to 
continue his travels, so he accepted a place in Sultan Muhammad’s 
embassy that was being sent to escort a delegation of 15 Chinese 
ambassadors back to the Yuan imperial court. 


This expedition was attacked less than 100 miles from Delhi. In the 
melee, Ibn Battuta was separated from the rest of the delegation. He 
describes how he was captured and nearly killed by bandits who 
took everything he had except his trousers. But they finally showed 
pity and allowed him to escape. 
Firuz Shah


The next Sultan of the Tughluq dynasty, Firuz Shah (r. 1351–1388), 
was selected by the leading generals and theologians at court. One 
historian and prominent Sunni Islamic theologian, Ziauddin Barani, 
wrote a tarikh, or Persian language history, of the reign. This genre of 
history is similar to Western-style histories. The narrative proceeds 
chronologically, recounting the words and deeds of humans, 
although occasional references to Allah’s will appear. 


Sultan Firuz Shah also consulted with Barani on the best way to rule 
the sultanate. That scholar explained how Islamic theology regarding 

A History of India
148
the equality of humans as the creations of Allah should be reconciled 
with the jati social system prevalent within the sultanate. Barani 
explained that God created all humans as equal but then allotted 
them appropriate degrees of virtue and vice. In Barani’s theology, the 
Hindu caste system is also valid in Islamic theology.


At the same time, many Muslim rulers had spiritual, and also 
political, relationships with Muslim saints and other holy men, 
called Sufis. By giving land and other gifts to these influential Sufis, 
the Muslim ruler gained the support of their spiritual power and 
also the loyalty or obedience of these holy men’s popular following, 
which often included non-Muslims as well as Muslims. 


These gifts of land were often on the frontiers of the kingdom. As 
Sufis brought this land into production, it increased the kingdom’s 
material wealth as well. 

Lecture 18—Indian Sultans 
149
Decline of the Tughluqs


The Tughluq dynasty gradually fragmented. It lacked the manpower 
and administrative expertise to effectively control regions beyond 
its heartland around Delhi. The sultan’s local commanders and 
governors successively broke away to establish sultanates of their 
own, either temporarily or permanently. This occurred in Madurai in 
1334, in Kashmir in 1339, in the Deccan in 1347, in Bengal in 1345, in 
Jaunpur in 1394, and in Gujarat in 1407. 


In addition, there were various regionally based kingdoms, many 
with Rajput or other Hindu rulers. Whenever possible, these 
subordinated regional rulers threw off the sultan’s rule. 


What became the largest of these kingdoms arose in the early 14th 
century in the southern Deccan. This kingdom was named after its 
capital, Vijayanagar, meaning “City of Victory.” The founders of this 
dynasty were brothers, Harihara and Bukka. According to some 
accounts, they were Hindus who had converted to Islam and served 
in the army of the sultanate before striking out on their own and 
reconverting to Hinduism from 1336 onward. 


Their followers were mostly mixed Kannada and Telugu speakers, 
and included both Hindus and Muslims. While some outmoded 
histories try to pose Vijayanagar as a bastion of Hinduism against the 
Muslim sultanates, this erases their many similarities in the forms of 
their administration, army, and culture.


The Tughluq regime was fatally weakened when another Central 
Asian Muslim, the Turkish warlord Timur, also known as Tamerlane, 
invaded India in 1398–1399. 


He sacked Delhi, taking vast wealth and many skilled artisans back 
to his own capital, Samarkand. Timur installed a loyal governor in 
Delhi. This became a new dynasty that claimed to be Sayyids, Arabs 
descended from the Prophet Muhammed himself. But they could

dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate, the Lodi Afghan clan.

power was shared within the Lodi clan, one family managed to

of Timur named Babur invaded from Afghanistan and founded the 
powerful Mughal Empire.

Lecture 19
The Early Mughal Empire
I
n 1526, a Muslim Central Asian adventurer named Zahiruddin 
Muhammad Babur led a small and diverse army from Kabul to 
conquer north India. His decisive victory over the fragmented 
Delhi Sultanate opened the upper Gangetic plain to him. This was 
the improbable beginning of what would become one of the largest, 
wealthiest, and most powerful empires of its day, famously known as 
the Mughal Empire. In this lecture, we’ll consider Babur’s origins and 
tempestuous career, his complex relations with the people and cultures of 
India, and the checkered career of his eldest son and main heir, Humayun. 
Babur’s Early Life


Babur was born as the eldest prince in the small Central Asian 
kingdom of Farghana. Babur’s mother was distantly descended 
from the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan. Babur’s father was one 
of many competing descendants of the Turkman conqueror Timur, 
or Tamerlane. Therefore, by birth Babur could claim imperial status, 
although he spent almost all of his life searching for an empire to 
conquer.


In 1494, when Babur was just 11, two invading armies approached 
Farghana, one led by a relative of Babur’s father and the other led 
by a relative of his mother. Suddenly, the royal pigeon loft collapsed, 
killing Babur’s father. This left young Babur to rally his scattered 
forces, which temporarily fended off his invading relatives.

Three times he briefly captured Samarkand, which had been Timur’s 
glorious capital and remained the biggest prize in Transoxiana, the 
land between the rivers Amu Darya and Syr Darya. But Babur could 
not hold Samarkand or even Farghana. His repeated defeats often

left him a refugee, fleeing for his life or begging shelter from more 
successful relatives. 


We can follow Babur’s perilous adventures and interior life through 
his remarkable personal journal, known as the Baburnama. At age 19 
he expressed great frustration and a desire to go to Mongolia. But in 
1501, he moved with his household over the Hindu Kush mountains 
toward Kabul. Two hundred Mongol and Turk mercenaries guarded 
them. By a stroke of good fortune, Babur seized Kabul from a cousin-
in-law. For the next two decades, Babur struggled to hold on to his 
new kingdom by subduing the rebellious Afghan clans around him. 


He also preserved his aspirations to recover all the lands that his 
distant ancestor, Timur, had once conquered. Only after Babur failed 
in Central Asia, however, did he turn to north India, which Timur 
had briefly raided in 1398. 
Next Moves


In 1519, Babur ineffectively demanded the submission of young 
Sultan Ibrahim of Delhi, a fellow Sunni Muslim. It would be seven 
years later, on Babur’s fifth attempt, that he finally defeated the 
vastly larger Delhi Sultanate army on the battlefield at Panipat.


Sultan Ibrahim’s huge army of about 100,000 men and hundreds of 
elephants emerged from Delhi to face Babur. But Ibrahim’s force was 
unwieldy and internally divided among unruly generals. Ibrahim 
encamped near Panipat and then waited, immobile, for Babur to 
attack.


In contrast, Babur estimated he had less than 12,000 followers. 
Babur’s men included Turk, Mongol, Arab, Afghan, and Baluch 
warriors. Most were horse-mounted, bow-armed mercenaries who 
only followed him into India in order to plunder. But Babur’s army 
was extremely mobile. 

A History of India
154


Further, he had some muskets and small cannon. He used those to 
strengthen his center, protecting them behind about 700 carts that 
he had roped together. Babur also used his cavalry to harass supply 
lines. 


When Ibrahim belatedly moved his army forward, Babur’s center 
held while his Mongol horsemen swept around both enemy flanks. 
Ibrahim’s war elephants scattered, he died, and his army fled, 
leaving many thousands killed.


Facing no further organized opposition, Babur marched the sixty 
miles to Delhi. There Babur seized the rich royal treasury and 
proclaimed his own rule in the city’s mosques. Babur also dispatched 
his eldest son, Humayun, to seize more distant Agra.
A Rival Emerges


Babur’s shattering of the Delhi Sultanate opened new possibilities 
for expansion by ambitious rival Indian rulers and warlords. The 
most threatening ruler who marched against Babur was Maharana 
Sangram Singh, a Hindu. 


He now pressed north into the heart of India, leading a coalition of 
Rajput, Indo-Afghan, and Indian Muslim clans. Babur concentrated 
his forces, now including substantial numbers of Indian Muslims. 


For the first time, Babur faced a predominantly non-Muslim army. 
Hence, he sought sectarian and divine support by highlighting 
his Islamic identity more than ever before. He exempted all 
Muslims from taxes on cattle and goods. He publicly renounced 
wine (forbidden in Islam), even destroying a large, newly arrived 
shipment of wine from Ghazni. 


He shattered his gold and silver drinking vessels, distributing the 
valuable shards to poor Muslims. All the soldiers of what Babur now 

Lecture 19—The Early Mughal Empire 
155
called his “Army of Islam” swore on the Quran to fight as ghazis 
(Islamic warriors) in a jihad until death. 


In 1527, the armies clashed near Agra. After desperate fighting, 
Babur’s forces prevailed and Maharana Sangram Singh fled 
wounded. In triumph, Babur built a huge tower of enemy skulls 
in the Timurid fashion and seized territories from those who had 
opposed him. Featuring his newly emphasized Islamic identity, 
Babur officially added Ghazi to his own titles and coins. 
Later in Babur’s Life


During the four years before his death, Babur remained personally 
ambivalent about settling in India, but he displayed a remarkable 
openness to new experiences there. He inquisitively explored selected 
aspects of his new domain, fascinating for their unexpectedness. 


He devoted many pages of his autobiography to describing in 
meticulous detail the nature of India’s distinctive animals and plants, 
and its monumental buildings and systems of weights and measures. 


Significantly, he wrote relatively little about India’s diverse people 
or their cultures. Babur sought to create pleasurable refuges in the 
Central Asian style that would isolate him and his household from 
India’s hot dry winds and dust. 


An inevitable problem for any kingdom is succession. Babur tried 
to settle his legacy by allocating his territories among his sons: 
Humayun, the eldest, was to receive India and the imperial status 
of Padshah, and his three other sons received Kabul and other 
territories. 


When Babur died in Agra in 1530, his body was returned to Kabul 
for burial as he had directed. Despite Babur’s testament, but 
following Timurid practice, his four sons would fight desperately for 

A History of India
156
supremacy. Indeed, his main successor, Humayun, proved unable to 
sustain the Mughal Empire that his father had initiated. 
Humayun’s Rule


When Humayun acceded at age 22, he was largely unfamiliar with 
India. In fact, he spent a total of 80 percent of his life outside it. 
Effectively administering an empire the size of north India required 
practical policies and techniques unfamiliar to Humayun. 


Instead, he sought to locate himself symbolically within the 
cosmic order, reflecting his own mystical claims to be the universal 
sovereign. He constructed his court as a microcosm of the universe, 
centered on his own sacred self. He draped a veil over his turban and 
face, sheltering his courtiers from his divine splendor, occasionally 
ritually raising his veil to reveal his effulgence. 


Immediately upon his accession, Humayun decided to conquer 
much of South Asia despite the many powerful rulers and warlords 
pressing against him and despite his limited knowledge of his new 
domain. 


Threatening Humayun from the central and lower Ganges plain 
were shifting coalitions of Indo-Afghans and the Sultan of Bengal, 
supported by local landholders and cultivators. Continuing Babur’s 
military momentum, Humayun’s imperial forces under his direct 
command gained some initial victories there. 


But then another threat impinged from the southwest: the wealthy 
sultanate of Gujarat, which controlled major ports for India’s 
trade across the Indian Ocean. Humayun’s campaigns there met 
opposition from his major Central Asian commanders. Humayun 
abandoned this effort. 


Seeking to restore his regime’s confidence and his ability to reward 
his supporters with looted treasuries, Humayun again led his main 

Lecture 19—The Early Mughal Empire 
157
forces down the Ganges toward the wealthy sultanate of Bengal. 
Although his army achieved some victories, many of his Central 
Asian supporters felt uncomfortable in humid, riverine Bengal. For his 
part, Humayun reportedly withdrew from active leadership, shutting 
himself off with his wives in a pleasure palace, indulging in opium. 
The Downfall


As Humayun’s political and military situation deteriorated, a 
younger brother, Hindal, claimed his own sovereignty in Agra. 
Humayun decided unwisely to move his army up the Ganges, too 
late to avoid the monsoon that made roads virtually impassable. 


An increasingly powerful Sher Khan, supported by growing numbers 
of other Indo-Afghan commanders who had abandoned Humayun, 
blocked his way. In June 1539, as Humayun’s weakened forces 
marched westward from Bengal, they met Sher Khan’s more effective 
army at Chausa. 


Humayun’s sodden, dispirited and outmaneuvered Mughal army 
lost badly. He escaped to Agra. Seeking to recover his lost territories 
and prestige, Humayun marched against Sher Khan again, losing 
even more decisively at Kannauj in May 1540. His demoralized 
imperial army scattered even before serious combat began. Again, 
Humayun escaped. 


Driven out of India by Sher Khan (who acceded in Delhi as Sultan 
Sher Shah), Humayun fled west to the Punjab, losing supporters at 
each stage. Finally, he moved with his ever-shrinking entourage into 
the Sind desert. 


The Central Asian commanders had virtually all left. So thin was the 
layer of imperial administration over India that, after Humayun’s 
departure, few traces of his regime remained. The Mughal Empire 
virtually ended, just 14 years after it commenced with Babur’s 
invasion.

A History of India
158


Still on the run, Humayun was attracted to a young woman in his 
entourage named Hamida, then in her early teens. Her family and 
guardian objected that Humayun was too poor to marry. Hamida also 
asserted her personal objections and refused Humayun for weeks. 
Humayun, however, persisted until she finally wed him in desert exile. 


Within a year, in October 1542, Hamida bore Humayun his first 
surviving son (and fourth child), Akbar. But only months later, 
Humayun’s entire band was nearly captured by his rebellious 
brothers. Humayun, Hamida, and about 30 followers hurriedly 
escaped, abandoning Akbar. Akbar remained a royal hostage in his 
uncles’ custody for much of his infancy. 


Humayun and his small band, reduced to eating horsemeat parboiled 
in a battle helmet, crossed the Iranian frontier unannounced in 1544, 
hoping for honorable treatment. After negotiations, the Safavid 
emperor Shah Tahmasp provided an imperial welcome to his “younger 
brother” (although Humayun was, in fact, eight years older).


In 1545, after Humayun had spent about a year in Iran, Shah 
Tahmasp sent an army of 12,000 to assist Humayun in seizing 
Afghanistan from his brothers. Later that year, Humayun recaptured 
Kabul, recovering his imprisoned son, Akbar, as well.


For the next decade, Humayun lived largely as his father had for 
20 years—as Kabul’s insecure ruler, launching predatory raids in 
order to attract and reward warriors with loot. Humayun twice 
temporarily lost Kabul (and custody of Akbar) only to recover them. 
Not until 1555 did he actually invade India—when Sher Shah’s 
successors were particularly divided and weak. 


Despite 15 years of exile, Humayun’s diverse forces defeated the 
main Indo-Afghan army and seized Delhi in 1555. But, only seven 
months later, Humayun tripped while descending a steep stone 
staircase. He died from his injuries days later in January 1556. His 
12-year-old son Akbar now began his half-century-long reign.

The Reign of Emperor Akbar
A
kbar’s reign (1556–1605) established the Mughal Empire. When 
his father, Emperor Humayun, unexpectedly died in 1556, 
it was not clear that young Akbar would be able to gain the 
throne, or even survive. Akbar was the eldest son, but he was only 
13 years old and the Mughal Empire was very fragile and insecure. 
Eventually, however, Akbar emerged as the last man standing in a 
power struggle that saw him take autocratic rule. From there, Akbar 
instituted many policies that formed the Mughal Empire, as we’ll see 
in this lecture.
Policies, Part 1


In order to examine Akbar’s long 
reign, we should highlight three 
types of the many innovative policies 
that he devised and implemented to 
establish and expand the Mughal 
Empire. 


First, 
Akbar 
drew 
many 
Hindus, especially royal clans of 
Rajput regional rulers, into his 
administration and army. He married 
many Rajput brides. He employed 
their kinsmen and other Hindu 
warrior communities. Further, he 
generally reduced the sanctions and 
discrimination against Hindus that 
had 
characterized 
most 
Muslim 
regimes in India up to that time. 
Akbar

Lecture 20—The Reign of Emperor Akbar 
161


The initial impetus for Akbar’s Rajput marriages and subsequent 
incorporation of Hindus into his household, administration, and 
army seems to have come from an aspiring Rajput clan leader. 
Raja Bihari Mal was the beleaguered ruler over the small kingdom 
of Amber in today’s Rajasthan. In 1562, Bihari Mal offered his 
daughter, Harkha Bai, in marriage to 20-year-old Akbar, who had 
just emerged from regency.


Akbar already had two Central Asian Muslim wives, as was 
customary for his family. For decades, Akbar would continue to 
make political marriage alliances by wedding additional women 
from Muslim ruling families. But Akbar’s Hindu Rajput weddings 
were a dramatic innovation.


Those Rajput royal clans who gave brides to the Mughal imperial 
house gained much in exchange. Their sisters and daughters became 
empresses and their nephews potential emperors. Their own menfolk 
gained prominent positions in the imperial army and court. 


Akbar recognized the hereditary right of loyal Rajputs to rule over 
their traditional kingdoms, although under Mughal sovereignty. 
Thus, loyal Rajputs gained wealth and power in contrast to those 
rival Rajput clans that refused to provide brides to Mughal emperors. 


Akbar combined these Rajput policies with other measures that 
recognized Hindus and other non-Muslims as respected subjects. 
In particular, Akbar ended several taxes and regulations that 
discriminated against non-Muslims. Overall, Akbar’s incorporation 
of many non-Muslim Indians made the Mughal Empire much more 
of an Indian empire.
Policies, Part 2: Administration


With his second major set of policies, Akbar reorganized and 
centralized the imperial administration. Akbar ordered the leading 
thousand or so top officer-officials into a single, ranked hierarchy. Each 

A History of India
162
man received a numerical rank, from 10 up to 5,000, called a mansab. 
This rank could not be inherited. Instead, each man worked his way up 
through the system based on how much he pleased the emperor. 


These mansab holders, called mansabdars, had no fixed terms in 
office and often had very varied careers: Akbar might transfer them 
suddenly from one post to another in response to a campaign or 
crisis, or because of performance reasons.


While Akbar’s innovative mansab system had many new 
bureaucratic features, it also contained many personal and 
patrimonial characteristics. There was no entrance examination, 
nor could rich merchants buy their way in. Rather, appointments 
and promotions were all based on Akbar’s personal inspection and 
superhuman insight about the man’s true worth, usually supported 
by recommendations from high officials whom Akbar trusted.


At the mansabdar’s death, all his property went to the emperor. 
Sometimes, the emperor might restore some of it to a favored 
official’s sons. This further increased a mansabdar’s and his family’s 
dependence on the emperor’s continued goodwill.


These numerical ranks also specified the number of cavalrymen 
that the mansabdar was required to recruit and pay for. Those 
soldiers served him, but he served the emperor, so the imperial army 
largely consisted of contingents of different sizes under individual 
mansabdars. 


By 1595, Akbar had 1,823 mansabdars, with an official collective 
obligation to provide an estimated 141,000 cavalrymen. Additionally, 
there were considerable forces directly paid by and serving under 
Akbar, making Akbar’s standing imperial army one of the very 
biggest in the world at that time.


In order to efficiently control the growing land revenues, Akbar’s 
administration began to survey all the villages in the empire, even 

Lecture 20—The Reign of Emperor Akbar 
163
measuring individual fields. His officials calculated how to extract as 
much tax income as possible without overtaxing the farmers. 


Then Akbar’s central administration began to assign to each high 
official the revenue from specific lands. This revenue assignment 
became known as a jagir. A mansabdar ranked 1,000, for example, 
would receive a jagir that produced exactly the right amount 
of revenue income for his official salary at that rank. If he were 
promoted to mansab 2,000, he would be assigned additional jagirs. 


One of the major improvements of Akbar’s systems was that these 
jagirs were not permanent. Instead, the central administration 
reassigned them periodically. That way, a mansabdar would not be 
able to put down roots in his jagir. Rather, he would be dependent on 
the emperor’s continued approval in order to receive new jagirs to 
replace ones reassigned away from him. 


Akbar also began to systematize the administration in each province. 
He appointed a governor for each province, as well as a revenue 
supervisor, a military commander, a chief judge, and a head news 
writer. 


Akbar also decreed that the official language of his government 
would be Persian. This meant that the records anywhere in 
the empire could be read by all officials trained in Persian. The 
many Indian Muslims and Hindus who were employed in the 
imperial administration as clerks, record keepers, tax collectors, 
and accountants were all socialized into the Persian language and 
Mughal imperial court culture. 
Policies, Part 3: Imperial Ideology


Akbar created an imperial ideology that drew together diverse 
Islamic mystical religions ideas and practices as well as Indian 
ones. This new imperial ideology weakened the earlier connection 

A History of India
164
between orthodox Sunni Muslims and the empire. But this ideology 
gave Akbar more control over his own religious policies. 


In particular, he created an imperial devotional cult centered on 
himself. This attracted the reverence of key imperial officials, and 
also many of his Indian subjects, both Muslim and Hindu. 


During Akbar’s early years, he respected the orthodox Sunni 
traditions of his ancestors. But with his third set of policies, Akbar 
gradually created innovative imperial ideologies, incorporating the 
cultures of his diverse subjects.


For instance, around 1575, Akbar built a highly controversial 
building, called the Ibadat Khana (Arabic for “divine worship hall”). 
This building housed fiery debates among leading religious scholars 
and leaders, over which Akbar arbitrated. 


In 1578, during a hunt, Akbar collapsed in a fit, terrifying his 
attendants. After regaining consciousness, he suddenly ordered 
thousands of trapped animals freed. He had his hair shorn 
(reportedly to enable his soul to escape at death). 


Akbar apparently felt empowered by this experience. He soon added 
to his many Islamic titles Amir al-Mu’minin, “Commander of the 
Faithful.” This asserted his leadership over the Muslim community 
in India and globally.


The next year, in 1579, a mahzar (pronouncement) circulated at court. 
This mahzar attested that Akbar had the ultimate power to decide all 
religious questions as long as his interpretation did not contradict 
the Quran. All the prominent Sunni religious scholars at court felt 
compelled to sign, or else face exile.


Akbar next broadened his Ibadat Khana debates to include scholars 
and holy men from various Indian religious communities. He 
listened closely, challenging each speaker’s assertions, testing them 

Lecture 20—The Reign of Emperor Akbar 
165
against his own developing theology, and adopting parts of their 
ideology when they confirmed or advanced his own. 


Around 1583, Akbar reportedly ceased performing the orthodox five 
daily Islamic prayers. Instead, he began publicly worshipping the 
sun four times daily and divine light more generally. 


Akbar also had an elaborate protruding balcony, called a jharoka, 
atop an outer wall of his citadel. From there, he displayed himself 
daily to his subjects on the ground below, who variously reassured 
themselves of his good health, savored his latest sartorial fashion, or 
worshipped him. 


Akbar quizzed the Jesuits at his court about an atlas they presented 
to him. He questioned how the European cartographer could know 
the names and locations of Indian cities. But Akbar made no practical 
use of the atlas or of European-style globes he later received, treating 
them as curiosities not a new technology. 


Akbar also recognized the value of Europeans as potential military 
and political allies, or else troublesome adversaries. In 1582, Akbar 
dispatched two envoys to King Philip II of Spain and Portugal, 
proposing regular diplomatic exchanges and requesting Arabic and 
Persian translations of the Pentateuch, Gospels, and Psalms. 


Akbar’s emissaries, however, never got farther than Goa. Further, 
Akbar found unconvincing the Jesuits’ insistence on monogamy, 
the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, and the low status of the Prophet 
Muhammad. Ultimately, Akbar frustrated Jesuit expectations for his 
conversion. 


Gradually, Akbar created a new court culture centering on him. 
Service to Akbar would be the main—perhaps the only—way for 
men to reach their highest virtue. Their own households should be 
microcosms of his, and they themselves work to become perfect men 
within them. 

A History of India
166


Reorienting time, Akbar devised a new solar-based calendar, called 
Tarikh-i Ilahi (meaning the “Divine Era”), which began with his own 
accession. 


Akbar also added “Allahu Akbar” to imperial documents and coins. 
This phrase conventionally means, “God is Great,” but it also literally 
means, “Akbar is God.” The emperor was suggesting his own divine 
status.


Among Akbar’s courtiers and household, a special imperial cult 
developed that centered on him as the universal spiritual master and 
cosmic sovereign, superior to all other religious or political authority. 
The initiation reportedly involved especially deep prostration to 
Akbar and repudiating all other religions. 


Initiates received from Akbar an icon of the sun, a special turban, 
and a small portrait of him to wear on the head or breast. Imitating 
Akbar, but going against orthodox Muslim custom, many disciples 
shaved off their beards. 


Akbar’s publicist Abu’l-Fazl repeatedly proclaimed him “divine 
light” itself: an earthly embodiment of the sacred, the millennial 
sovereign. But many orthodox Sunnis objected strongly to Akbar’s 
pretensions, although few dared to attach him openly.

Lecture 21
Later Mughal Emperors
T
he Mughal Empire expanded across South Asia during the 
16th and 17th centuries to become one of the world’s largest, 
wealthiest, and most potent states. Much of its power and 
authority resulted from Emperor Akbar’s innovations. However, 
Akbar’s successors each reigned in his own imperial style. Emperor 
Jahangir elaborated on Akbar’s accomplishments, ever desirous 
of exceeding his father. Next, Emperor Shah Jahan constructed the 
most sophisticated and impressive manifestations of Mughal glory, 
including the jewel-encrusted Peacock Throne, the Taj Mahal, and the 
walled capital city of Shahjahanabad (now famous as Old Delhi). In 
this lecture, we’ll consider these two emperors. 
Akbar Passes


Throughout his long reign, Akbar had become ever more 
religiously heterodox. Many conservative Sunni Muslim generals, 
officials, and scholars supported Jahangir against allegedly 
heretical Akbar. 


Jahangir even arranged the assassination of Akbar’s closest 
confidant, the historian Abu’l-Fazl. Jahangir gleefully received the 
severed head and rewarded the assassin lavishly. 


While the armies of the father and the son threatened each other, 
the women of the imperial family sought to smooth over their 
differences. Finally, as Emperor Akbar lay dying, his rebellious son 
Jahangir reluctantly begged his forgiveness, accepted a short and 
symbolic punishment, and was recognized as the official heir. 

A History of India
168
Jahangir Takes Over


After Jahangir finally acceded to the throne in 1605, he determined to 
make his reign even more glorious than his father’s. Over the years, 
Jahangir innovated creatively. He redefined imperial weights and 
measures, which required the recalculation of all official accounts. 


He commissioned coins portraying him holding a wineglass. He also 
increased by 20 percent the size of silver coins minted for general 
circulation, which disrupted the economy. Jahangir realized that 
he had overreached here, so after six years, he restored the official 
coinage to Akbar’s standards. 


As prince and then emperor, Jahangir patronized a large staff of 
expert painters. He commissioned art both for its own aesthetic sake 
and also as political propaganda. Jahangir preferred naturalistic and 
direct representations, having himself portrayed as a peaceful and 
serene ruler, engaged in spiritual rather than worldly concerns.


Jahangir quizzed men from various religions, often posing 
provocative questions and pitting theologians against each other. For 
instance, Portuguese Jesuits were a small but constant presence at his 
court. They recorded how Jahangir probed their beliefs about Jesus 
and his miracles. 


Jahangir was clearly bemused by their explanations about monastic 
celibacy and the Catholic concept of the Holy Trinity. But in 1610, 
he permitted Jesuits to baptize three of his nephews. The Jesuits 
saw this as Jahangir’s gradual acceptance of Catholicism, but some 
later historians explain this as a way for Jahangir to disqualify those 
disfavored nephews from imperial succession. 


Europeans 
also 
affected 
the 
empire 
through 
increasing 
intercontinental trade. They imported vast amounts of silver and 
gold, originally extracted from the Americas. With this money, they 
purchased Indian-made textiles and other products.

A History of India
170
Further Developments


While Jahangir’s armies achieved victories in all directions, 
many newly conquered territories were never fully integrated 
administratively. This resulted in an ever more sprawling empire.


Like his father, Jahangir needed to rely on Hindu Rajput generals. 
But he appointed no Hindus to high offices at the imperial center 
and only a few as provincial governors. Jahangir respected his own 
Rajput mother, and he married at least five Rajput wives (in addition 
to about 14 Muslim women). 


But Jahangir was devoted only to his final wife, Nur Jahan, who 
eventually dominated the final decade of his reign. More than any 
other Mughal empress, Nur Jahan prominently participated in 
public affairs. She conducted diplomacy and issued imperial orders 
and minted coins. Further, she sought to perpetuate her power by 
determining the imperial succession. 


Jahangir and Nur Jahan initially favored his third son (by a different 
wife), whom they married to Nur Jahan’s niece. They honored him 
with the royal title Shah Jahan (“King of the World”) and gave him 
command over the imperial armies in the strategic Deccan region of 
central India. 
Jahangir’s Fall


Gradually Jahangir weakened from his longstanding alcohol and 
drug addictions. From 1620 onward, he traveled almost every spring 
to Kashmir, where he spent the summer savoring its cool mountain 
climate, far removed from the heat and politics of north India.


Up to that point, Jahangir’s relations with the Iranian Safavid Empire 
had largely continued through competitive diplomacy rather than 
warfare. However, ailing Jahangir’s complacency was shattered in 
1622 when a powerful Safavid expedition seized the strategic Afghan 
city of Qandahar from the inadequate Mughal garrison. 

Lecture 21—Later Mughal Emperors 
171


A shocked Jahangir immediately ordered almost all his imperial 
forces diverted from their current deployments for a massive 
expedition to retake Qandahar. In particular, he demanded that Shah 
Jahan bring his armies from the Deccan to lead this expedition. 


Despite Shah Jahan’s superior military reputation, he lost repeatedly 
against stronger imperial armies. Each time, his status as imperial 
prince and possible next emperor enabled him to gather more 
forces, only to be defeated again. Finally, Shah Jahan negotiated a 
submissive truce, sending his sons to Nur Jahan as hostages and 
agreeing to stay away from the imperial court. 


After the ailing emperor’s final visit to Kashmir, he died in 1627. 
This deprived Nur Jahan of her strongest claim to imperial authority: 
acting in Jahangir’s name. Meanwhile, Shah Jahan and his supporters 
defeated, imprisoned, blinded, and then executed his remaining 
brothers and all other possible heirs. But Shah Jahan allowed Nur 
Jahan to withdraw quietly from imperial politics.

Shah Jahan identified strongly with his Sunni Muslim Central Asian 
ancestors. Indeed, he always devoutly performed the required five 
daily prayers and the month-long fast during Ramadan. Although 
Jahangir had compelled him to start drinking wine at age 24, Shah 
Jahan repudiated the practice at 30. 


Shah Jahan’s biological mother was a Hindu Rajput. He employed 
Rajputs extensively as generals and warriors, including on several 
imperial expeditions into distant Central Asia. However, he gave 
Rajputs no high appointments in his central administrative and only 
one governorship. Further, he strongly condemned marriages in 
which either spouse left Islam for Hinduism. 


Unlike predecessors who personally wrote their own memoirs, 
Shah Jahan instead closely supervised the series of historians he 
commissioned to compile his massive official regnal chronicle, the 
Padshahnama. Shah Jahan had drafts regularly read out to him for his 
correction or elaboration.


Advancing his commitment to glorifying his reign, Shah Jahan 
personally supervised most major imperial building projects and 
periodically inspected their progress. In particular, he deeply 
engaged himself in the design and construction of the Taj Mahal in 
Agra, which was the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.


After this tomb’s construction, Shah Jahan ordered the huge number 
of skilled builders and workmen to migrate to Delhi in 1639. There 
he commissioned his new imperial capital, Shahjahanabad. This city 
had an imposing red-sandstone-walled citadel, popularly known as 
the Red Fort, overlooking the Jumna River. 


Throughout the city, imperial hydraulic engineers constructed 
water supply and sewage systems. Plentiful potable water came 
from wells in each neighborhood and from the Jumna River, either 
raised by Persian waterwheels or channeled from upstream by 
canals.

Challenges and Children


Meanwhile, the empire faced challenges. Various local rulers and 
landholders within the empire paid tribute or taxes only under 
compulsion. Rebellions erupted whenever imperial armies were 
committed elsewhere. Prominent rebels were eventually punished 
by superior imperial force, but most who begged forgiveness were 
pardoned and reinstated by Shah Jahan. 


Evoking his family’s own origins, Shah Jahan oriented himself 
culturally and politically toward Central Asia. From 1646 onward, he 
sent substantial armies to conquer there. However, these expeditions 
gained the empire virtually nothing while costing money, manpower, 
and prestige.



Like his predecessors, Shah Jahan wanted (but failed) to delay the 
succession struggle until after his own death. He tried to bequeath 
the empire intact to his eldest son, Dara Shikoh. All four brothers 
were children of the late Mumtaz Mahal. 


Shah Jahan also kept his eldest child and favorite daughter, Jahanara 
Begum, near him. Upon the death of her mother, Mumtaz Mahal, 
Shah Jahan gave half her huge wealth to 17-year-old Jahanara. The 
other half was divided among her siblings. Jahanara remained 
unmarried, led the harem, and managed the imperial household 
despite the fact that Shah Jahan had two living wives. 


In 1644, Jahanara’s clothing accidently caught fire. Two of her maids 
died extinguishing the blaze, and Jahanara suffered life-threatening 
burns. Shah Jahan personally tended her and, upon her recovery, 
distributed her weight in gold as charity. 


With her own funds, Jahanara bestowed much patronage, 
commissioning gardens and mosques in Shahjahanabad and 
Kashmir. Combining her religious and literary commitments, she 
had herself initiated into two Sufi orders and wrote accounts of their 
leading saints. Like Shah Jahan, she strongly supported Dara, her 
younger full brother, who shared many of her inclinations. 


Dara initiated into a Sufi order and wrote five works on Sufism. He 
sought the universal truth of Islam, including through esoteric Indic 
religions. 


The emperor kept Dara near him, but deployed his three other sons 
as governors and commanders throughout his empire. This gave 
them administrative and military experience and enabled them to 
build their own factions. Over time, Shah Jahan’s third son, Prince 
Aurangzeb (later known as Emperor Alamgir), proved the most 
successful. While governing the Deccan, Aurangzeb assembled 
and commanded the empire’s most powerful and battle-hardened 
armies.

Lecture 21—Later Mughal Emperors



The actual succession crisis began prematurely, when Shah Jahan 
suffered a serious intestinal disorder in September 1657. While 
disabled, he entrusted rule to Dara. Although Shah Jahan recovered 
by November, the three younger sons had already agreed to unite 
against Dara. But each of the three also declared himself emperor. 


Driving onward, Aurangzeb imprisoned Shah Jahan in Agra and 
then defeated and executed his brothers and their main supporters, 
including his own eldest son. Thus, the pattern of Shah Jahan’s 
accession recurred at his reign’s end: Only one imperial prince 
survived the bloody succession war. However, this time, the former 
emperor remained alive. 


For nearly eight years, Aurangzeb kept Shah Jahan imprisoned in 
Agra Fort. Shah Jahan died at age 74 from natural causes. Even then, 
Aurangzeb allowed little ceremony for his interment next to Mumtaz 
Mahal. Aurangzeb would rule for five decades.

Lecture 22
The Mughals and the Marathas
I
n 1658, a 40-old Mughal prince ruthlessly fought his way to seize 
the imperial throne. He chose as his official imperial title Alamgir, 
meaning “Seizer of the World,” to show his limitless ambitions. 
Over Emperor Alamgir’s nearly 50-year-long reign, he extended the 
martial power of the Mughal Empire from its north Indian heartland. He 
conquered almost all of South Asia, more territory than any previous ruler 
in Indian history. But Alamgir proved unable to politically or culturally 
incorporate the diverse, regionally based rulers and communities within 
the boundaries of his domain. The most prominent of those who rose 
against him were the Marathas, whom we’ll examine in this lecture after 
looking at Alamgir’s Mughals. 
Alamgir’s Religion


Emperor Alamgir consistently sought to behave and govern 
according to his strongly orthodox Sunni Muslim beliefs. Throughout 
his life, he was known for strictly following the devotional, dietary, 
and sartorial practices of an observant Muslim. 


After his enthronement, Alamgir began to purify his court of what 
he considered the unorthodox and un-Islamic practices of his 
predecessors. For instance, he prohibited his courtiers from wearing 
gold or red garments, considered improper by many devout Muslims. 


Alamgir also terminated the heated debates among advocates of 
various religious traditions that his predecessors had patronized 
at court. Instead, he ordered his best Sunni scholars to compile the 
most authoritative legal judgments of the Hanafi school of law into 
the Persian-language Fatawa-i ‘Alamgiri. Orthodox Sunni Islamic 
scholars always received his patronage. 

Lecture 22—The Mughals and the Marathas 
177


The emperor also presented himself as a leader within the larger 
Islamic world. He sent a series of richly laden embassies to the Sharif 
of Mecca, seeking legal validation for his reign. Alamgir’s agents also 
prominently distributed vast amounts of charity in that holy city, 
though he later expressed frustration at additional requests from the 
Sharif for ever more presents.


During his reign, Alamgir expressed his deep commitment to Sunni 
Islam by particularly favoring officials and subjects who did likewise, 
including converts. Meanwhile, he increasingly ordered constraints 
on Hindus, which estranged the vast majority of his subjects and a 
large proportion of his officials. 
Resistance to Alamgir


Alamgir imposed policies that specifically burdened his Hindu 
Rajput officials. He reduced their incomes by assigning them less 
valuable jagirs, that is, land revenue awards. He forcefully intervened 
in the succession of one of their leading kingdoms, Marwar, located 
in the Rajasthan region of west-central India. 

A History of India
178


When the Marwar Rajputs resisted Alamgir’s intervention to their 
line of royal succession, he annexed Marwar. Some Marwar and 
other Rajputs continued fighting a guerilla war for decades, until 
after Alamgir’s own death.


Other long-subordinated communities across north India also rose 
up against Emperor Alamgir. In the Punjab, the region north of 
Rajasthan, a new religious movement had arisen during the 16th 
century: the Sikhs, who followed a series of gurus. 


During the early 17th century, the Sikh community revolted repeatedly 
against Mughal rule and repulsed several Mughal suppression 
campaigns. Emperor Alamgir tried to control this community by 
deciding the succession of its gurus. This interference only mobilized 
increasing militant Sikh resistance against Mughal authorities. 


In 1675, Alamgir arrested and executed their current guru, Tegh 
Bahadur. But Sikhs continued to fight for control over their homeland 
for decades, successfully achieving their own independent kingdom 
in the Punjab by the early 18th century.
Alamgir Moves On


In 1681, Alamgir left the north Indian heartland of the empire, never 
to return. Instead, he spent the remaining 26 years of his reign in the 
war-wracked Deccan. 


When his sons failed to achieve victory as generals there, Alamgir 
personally took command over the costly conquests of the remaining 
Deccan sultanates of Bijapur and Golkonda. 


Eventually victorious, he annexed both sultanates and imprisoned 
their rulers. But their former officials, landholders, and subjects 
remained resistant. Overall, these newly conquered lands proved 
disordered and unprofitable for the Mughal Empire.

Lecture 22—The Mughals and the Marathas 
179


Alamgir next committed his armies against the Marathas in the 
western Deccan. Seeking to coopt their generals, he awarded official 
imperial rank and incomes to many of them, until they outnumbered 
Rajputs among his high officials. These new Maratha officials 
rarely received prominent administrative posts and lacked any real 
commitment to the empire. 


Other dangerous forces along India’s coasts were the Portuguese and 
other European powers, especially the British East India Company. 
Alamgir had no blue-water navy and so he was powerless to oppose 
Europeans at sea. 
The Decline


As Alamgir passed through his 70s and 80s, he increasingly struggled 
to manage the empire as a whole. Alamgir expended considerable 
resources in his interminable Deccan wars. His massive imperial 
armies proved extremely costly and inefficient. 


Nonetheless, imperial commanders continued to expand. They 
raided kingdoms into the very far southern tip of India during 
the early 1690s, making those rulers nominal tributaries. But the 
imperial administration exerted little control there, or even over 
earlier captured Deccani territories. All this intensified the empire’s 
structural deficit as expenditures far exceeded income. 


The empire began to segment as revenue flows and communication 
links between north and south were periodically interrupted en 
route due to predations by bandits, warlords, and even intermediate 
imperial officials. 


In the Deccan, many imperial officials who originated in north 
India—including Rajputs and many long-settled Muslims—had been 
serving far from home through decades of frustrating harassment by 
local insurgents, especially Marathas. Imperial commanders often 

A History of India
180
saw little prospect of defeating these insurgents or particular benefit 
to the empire or themselves from doing so. 


Instead, many imperial generals preserved their own financial and 
manpower resources by negotiating private settlements with those 
enemies, despite Alamgir’s repeated, explicit orders forbidding this. 
For their part, many new Maratha and other Deccani officials, whose 
submission had been thus purchased, had little loyalty to the empire. 


In both north India and the Deccan, many tributary rulers, 
landholders, and other subjects—including peasants, artisans, 
merchants, and bankers—faced revenue demands from the empire 
but increasingly doubted the value of paying. Imperial officials had 
diminished capacity to provide justice or compel tax payments. In 
contrast, local rajas and landholders often had bonds with the local 
population and retained more revenues, which they used to bolster 
their own power. 


As Alamgir aged, he feared for his dynasty, not perceiving much 
capacity in any of his potential heirs. One of his five sons had 
rebelled and then died in exile in Iran. Another rebel son had died in 
imperial prison. 


Alamgir had punished each of his other three sons at one point 
or another. Further, Alamgir kept them and his nine maturing 
grandsons dependent on his cash and manpower. Hence, by 
Alamgir’s death, none of his heirs was particularly strong, especially 
compared to powerful imperial commanders and governors. 


Some later historians use Alamgir’s death in 1707 to mark the end 
of the Mughal Empire, since none of his descendants proved able 
to prevent the empire from fragmenting. Nonetheless, the dynasty 
and empire continued for another 150 years under a series of weak 
emperors who reigned but rarely ruled.

Lecture 22—The Mughals and the Marathas 
181
The Marathas


Displacing the Mughals were various rival powers that competed 
for domination over India. The most prominent of these were the 
Marathas. 


Many Marathas were small-scale, independent farmers who worked 
their own land. Many were also prepared to fight to defend or extend 
their holdings against all neighbors and outsiders. 


As the Muslim-ruled Deccani sultanates and Hindu-ruled Vijayanagar 
arose in the early 14th century, some Marathas served in their armies, 
gaining battle experience as soldiers and generals. 


The youthful Shivaji followed in his family’s martial tradition, 
rising through service in the armies of various regional rulers. After 
he emerged as an independent commander, Shivaji’s reputation 
mounted, as did the spoils he seized. 


As Emperor Alamgir fought to extend Mughal imperial control in 
the Deccan, he sent some of his best commanders and troops against 
Shivaji. But they repeatedly failed to defeat him. Spectacularly, 
Shivaji withstood a two-and-a-half-year-long siege by one of the 
highest ranked Mughal generals. Then Shivaji unexpectedly set out 
in 1663 to beat the much larger besieging imperial army.


Nine months later, Shivaji sacked the rich strategic Mughal port of 
Surat. This gained Shivaji and his followers vast wealth and prestige. 
These repeated disasters at Shivaji’s hands humiliated the Mughal 
Empire. 


Stubbornly, Alamgir sent against Shivaji an even more powerful 
army under one of his top commanders, a Hindu Rajput named Raja 
Jai Singh. Partially defeated, Shivaji had to relinquish most of his 
forts and territories. But he received approval to retain the rest and 
allied with the Mughals against the Bijapur Sultanate. 

A History of India
182


Alamgir himself sought to incorporate Shivaji by investing his 
young son, Sambhaji, with high imperial rank and by summoning 
them both to the Mughal court at Agra in 1666. However, like many 
newcomers to Alamgir’s court, Shivaji was alienated rather than 
assimilated. Shivaji deceived his guards, dramatically escaped back 
to his homeland, and rallied his followers there. 
Shivaji’s Measures


As the sultans of Bijapur and Golkonda, various other rulers, and 
rival factions within the Mughal administration all engaged in 
multisided conflicts in the Deccan, Shivaji intermittently supported 
or opposed each of them. In 1670, Shivaji plundered Surat yet 
again, adding to his own wealth and fame and again humiliating its 
imperial defenders. 


Shivaji further enhanced his status by ordering his own elaborate 
Brahmanic enthronement in 1674, with the new status of Chatrapati 
Maharaja (a traditional Sanskrit term meaning “Universal Emperor”). 


Shivaji eliminated many of the Persian-language terms and titles 
that had been used by his administration, copied from the sultanate 
and Mughal systems. Instead, Shivaji ordered the use of the Marathi 
language throughout his domain. He also made elaborate royal 
processions to the main centers and holy sites under his rule.


In these ways, Shivaji claimed that his regime stood for both 
Hinduism and a Marathi regional identity. His military success 
continued to attract followers. By his death in 1680, Shivaji ruled 
over 50,000 square miles, with revenue perhaps one-fifth as much as 
the entire Mughal Empire’s.
After Shivaji


Thereafter, the Maratha coalition remained the most expansive 
force in the Deccan. Even occasional triumphs by Alamgir failed 

Lecture 22—The Mughals and the Marathas 
183
to suppress the Marathas. During the 18th century, as the Mughal 
Empire fragmented under Alamgir’s weak heirs, various powerful 
Maratha commanders repeatedly led armies northward. They 
occasionally seized the Mughal capital of Shahjahanabad. 


They also marched eastward into Bengal. In each region, Maratha 
chiefs negotiated or simply collected taxes. Maratha forces also 
conquered south. But occasional battlefield defeats along with 
periodic internal conflicts led to temporary withdrawals. 


Perhaps the bloodiest battle in all of Indian history was fought at 
Panipat in 1761. The Maratha army, with many Indian allies, fought 
against the Afghan invader Ahmad Shah Abdali. Both sides were so 
battered that the Marathas withdrew from north India for a decade 
and Ahmad Shah left India, never to return.


However, Maratha generals gradually recovered as the dominant 
force in the Delhi region. They fought the expanding British East 
India Company armies in three wars, from 1775–1782, 1803–1805, 
and finally 1817–1818. Defeat at the hands of the British in the last of 
these wars meant the end of Maratha ambitions to extend their own 
empire across India.

Competing European Empires
I
n 1498, three small Portuguese ships under Vasco da Gama sailed 
around the Cape of Good Hope, up the east African coast, and 
crossed the Indian Ocean. No one could have foretold the long-term 
consequences of this and other European explorations. In this lecture, we’ll 
first look at the Portuguese, who rapidly expanded around the world with 
the Indian west coast city of Goa as the center of their oceanic empire in 
Asia. We’ll next discuss the competing East India Companies that sought 
to profit from India’s exports, especially the British (or English) East India 
Company. The consequences of these early interactions between diverse 
Indians and Europeans would dramatically alter the world.
The Portuguese


Even before Alexander the Great fought his way to the western 
borderlands of India in the 4th century B.C.E., Europeans had imagined 
distant India as a fabulously wealthy land, the source of spices, fine 
cloths, and exotic luxuries. But, following the Ottoman capture of 
Constantinople in 1453, the rising Ottoman Empire came to control 
European access east across the Mediterranean to the rich Orient. 


The Portuguese used their strategic location on the southwestern 
corner of Europe’s Atlantic coast to their advantage. Armed 
explorers under the sponsorship of the Portuguese king developed 
naval technology and navigational skills to try to reach Asia by 
sailing south around Africa. Thus, the expedition of Vasco da Gama 
was only one high point in a long series of Portuguese expeditions 
appointed and funded by the Portuguese king. 


Vasco da Gama was able to find India only with the guidance of 
local seamen experienced in long-distance navigation across the

Lecture 23—Competing European Empires 
187
Indian Ocean. The first Portuguese vessels landed at Calicut (a 
port in the southwestern province of Kerala now again called by its 
Indian name, Kozhikode). They first had to figure out who they had 
“discovered.” Since they did not really know about Hinduism, they 
assumed all the non-Muslim people living in India were Christians. 


The Indian Ocean had long experienced violence, with armed 
conflicts among various coastal kingdoms and roving pirates. 
However, the Portuguese ships, known as caravels, were more 
heavily armed than anything else afloat in that ocean. The caravels 
were also relatively fast and maneuverable. Thus, they were the 
world’s most advanced naval technology of their day. These naval 
advantages, and Portuguese ruthlessness, raised the intensity of the 
violence in the Indian Ocean. 


Vasco da Gama and his Portuguese successors mercilessly proved 
their might by seizing and burning rival Indian, Arab, African, 
Jewish, and Ottoman vessels and slaughtering the captured crews 
and passengers. The Portuguese did not accept ransoms as was 
customary. Indeed, they often acted with a millenarian determination 
to destroy Muslims. 
Portuguese Machinations


The Portuguese Empire along the shores of India expanded greatly 
after 1509 under Viceroy Alfonso de Albuquerque, a nobleman 
and experienced military commander. He established a chain 
of fortified Portuguese enclaves along the coasts of India and 
China. Many of these—like Diu and Bombay—were islands that 
were easily defended against attacks from the land. The largest 
Portuguese coastal enclave, and the capital of its empire in Asia, 
was Goa, which was protected from Indian land-based kingdoms 
by a river and canal. 


The Portuguese ships could not carry much cargo, so the Portuguese 
concentrated in the pepper trade, where a small volume of freight 

A History of India
188
could sell in Europe for many times its cost in India. Since the 
Portuguese did not have enough capital to purchase as much pepper 
as they wanted at prevailing market prices, they often blockaded 
other outlets and excluded other buyers so as to force down the price 
and raise the supply offered to them.


The Portuguese king also profited by forcing all non-Portuguese 
ships crossing the Indian Ocean to purchase a cartaz, a license or pass 
from authorities in Goa or another Portuguese outpost. This was a 
document bearing a Christian cross. Portuguese warships seized any 
ship that lacked a cartaz. 


Individual Portuguese officials and officers got only small salaries 
from their king. To make more money, they invested their personal 
capital with local merchants. Thus, the Portuguese Empire in India 
proved profitable for both the king and his employees. 


Indirectly, there were substantial consequences of the establishment 
of the Portuguese Empire in India. For one thing, the Portuguese 
imported various new crops from the Americas. These included 
tomatoes, potatoes, and chili peppers, which spread widely. It is 
hard for us today to think of Indian food without these new world 
crops. 


Invasive species and diseases affecting plants and people also 
arrived with the Portuguese. So did the more destructive European-
style cannon and other gunpowder weapons, which spread inland 
as Indian rulers purchased them and hired Portuguese mercenaries.


The Portuguese also tried to convert Indians to Roman Catholic 
Christianity. From 1578 onward, there were almost always Jesuit 
Catholic missionaries at the Mughal imperial court. 


While the Portuguese did increase the number of Roman Catholics in 
India, these were never more than a tiny fraction of the population. 
A large number of Indian Catholics were converted Syrian Christians 

Lecture 23—Competing European Empires 
189
who had already been living along the southwest coast for over 1,000 
years.


These Syrian Christians often proved to be useful commercial and 
political allies for the Portuguese. They provided local knowledge 
to their fellow Christians while receiving some favorable policies 
from the Portuguese in their coastal enclaves. But many Portuguese 
believed they had the religious duty to convert Syrian Orthodox 
communities to the “true” Roman Catholic form of Christianity. 
From 1560, the Portuguese set up an Inquisition and pressured 
Syrian Christians to convert to Roman Catholicism. Many did, but 
not all.


While the Portuguese were the most powerful seaborne state, they 
never extended their territories inland. Instead, the Mughal imperial 
dynasty expanded across India’s lands during the late 16th and the 
17th centuries. The Mughals, who arrived in India almost 30 years 
after the Portuguese, proved able to control the Portuguese on land 
whenever they became too disruptive. 
The English East India Company


On New Year’s Eve in 1600, Queen Elizabeth I bestowed a royal 
charter on a group of London merchants who wanted to tap into 
the vast wealth of the Indies. Queen Elizabeth decreed that this new 
English corporation, the English (or British) East India Company, 
would have a monopoly over all trade there, from southern Africa 
all the way to the Philippines. The royal charter also allowed the 
company to use force and establish trading posts to advance its 
commercial goals. 


The English East India Company represented the beginning of a 
new economic world order. Earlier, when an individual European 
merchant had sent out a ship full of his own trade goods to Asia, he 
took a massive risk over the year or more until the ship returned, if 
it ever did. But when a corporation with many shareholders sent out

Elizabeth I

Lecture 23—Competing European Empires 
191
ships, the risk was spread among them. Further, the profits from the 
cargoes that did return were large enough to cover the losses and 
also pay dividends to all the stockholders. 


This company had a growing number of permanent employees, with 
expanding archives of detailed records. It used a fleet of specially 
designed ships that it hired on long-term contracts. This all meant 
that the competing English East India Company, Dutch East India 
Company, and French East India Company had the potential to 
become much bigger than the Portuguese royal enterprise.


English and other northern European shipwrights knew how to 
build larger vessels than the Portuguese caravels. These so-called 
East Indiamen ships had more cargo space and could carry enough 
cannons to protect themselves against the Portuguese, the pirates of 
the Indian Ocean, and the small coastal forces of Indian rulers. 


Growing numbers of Indian weavers began working to supply the 
export market, some 80,000 in Bengal alone by the mid-18th century. 


At first, the English East India Company’s stockholders were 
mainly interested in profitable trade, with as few expenses from 
political or military entanglements as possible. The relatively few 
East India Company merchants who reached India soon developed 
partnerships with Indian merchants, bankers, and brokers who 
negotiated and profited as middlemen between the Europeans and 
the Indian producers. 


From the start, the East India Companies sent envoys to the Mughal 
emperor and to local regional rulers seeking rights to trade, tax 
concessions, and land on which to build their warehouses. 


On the west coast, the English East India Company built a warehouse 
at Surat in 1613. Later, when Surat’s harbor silted up, they shifted 
to Bombay in 1668. The company also got land in southeast India, 
principally at Madras in 1639, then in Bengal at Calcutta in 1690. 

A History of India
192


While Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta, grew into major cities, none 
had been more than a tiny village before the English East India 
Company built warehouses and then fortresses there. They had to be 
fortified since they contained treasuries for the purchase of valuable 
Indian products awaiting shipment to Europe. 
Conflict


This was a period of much conflict in India. Over the 18th century, 
the Mughal Empire fragmented as its governors broke away to 
create their own kingdoms and as new regional powers like the 
Marathas rose up through conquest. These many competing 
rulers and warlords regarded these European enclaves as an easy 
source of taxes or plunder. But the experience of the many long 18th 
century European wars meant that European military science was 
developing fast. Infantry, weapons, and combat cohesion had all 
improved. 


As an alternative to expensively training and importing European 
soldiers, the English hired Indian soldiers starting in about 1660. 
These Indian soldiers became known as sepoys when they were 
trained and armed in the European style. Sepoy regiments almost 
always defeated the larger cavalry-based armies of Indian rulers. At 
its peak, the English East India Company armies contained a quarter 
of a million Indian sepoy volunteers.


The French and English sepoy armies grew and fought each other 
as the various European wars extended to Asia. The War of the 
Austrian Succession in the 1740s is known in the U.S. as one of the 
French and Indian Wars. In 1745, the English and their American 
colonists captured the Fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island, 
Canada, from the French. The next year, in India, the French East India 
Company captured Madras from the English East India Company. In 
the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, London and Paris agreed to swap 
back Louisburg and Madras.

Eventually, English control over the oceans and greater commercial 
success globally meant that the French were driven out of India. The 
Dutch East India Company concentrated its efforts in Indonesia. By 
the late 18th century, the English East India Company dominated 
other Europeans in the Indian Ocean region. The volume of trade 
exploded, with English imports from India rising over 500 percent 
between 1670 and 1740.

Lecture 24
The British East India Company
B
etween 1757 and 1857, the British East India Company (also known 
as the English East India Company) went from being mainly a 
commercial corporation to seizing direct or indirect control over 
all of India, totaling roughly a million and a half square miles. This made 
it bigger than any other empire in all of India’s history. Plus, India had 
a huge population, at least 270 million people around 1800. This empire 
building was even more striking since there were only a few thousand 
British officials and officers there at any one time. In this lecture, we’ll 
survey the major ways that the various Britons and Indians interacted 
over this first century of expanding British colonial rule. 
Robert Clive


By the late 18th century, weak Mughal emperors still nominally 
reigned over most of India, but they were really prisoners of one 
or another regent. Instead, most parts of India were under either 
regionally based kings or else Mughal successor states. 


For example, in 1756, Siraj ud-Daula at age 23 inherited his 
grandfather’s position as nawab, or Mughal governor, of the rich 
province of Bengal. One of his first acts was to attack the English East 
India Company’s outpost in Calcutta. 


The British officer Robert Clive rushed by sea from Madras, bringing 
with him Indian sepoys. They quickly recovered Calcutta. Clive then 
marched his forces, totaling about 800 Europeans and 2,200 sepoys, 
against Siraj ud-Daula’s army of about 50,000 men.


Clive bribed one of the opposing generals, Mir Jafar, promising to 
make him the new nawab of Bengal if he would betray his master

and also pay up to 20 million rupees. Part of the money went to the 
East India Company, but also much went to Clive personally. 


The company also demanded and received a trade monopoly over 
some of the most profitable and prestigious products in the region. 
The famous June 23rd, 1757 Battle of Plassey turned out to be more 
bribery than actual fighting. Mir Jafar then hunted down and 
executed the defeated nawab. 


The East India Company’s officials in India had thus suddenly seized 
vast power and wealth. In fact, after Plassey, the East India Company 
controlled an area that three times the size of England and far more 
densely populated. 


From this point onward, the East India Company was able to take 
enough from its trade monopolies and the taxes it collected from 
Bengal that it could purchase all the Indian products it wanted and 
still ship home additional gold and silver. For the first time in history 
India, not Europe, had a trade deficit.


But Clive and many other Englishmen believed that a commercial 
corporation like the East India Company should not be a ruler. 
In 1759, just two years after Plassey, Clive wrote to the most 
influential British minister, William Pitt the Elder, Earl of Chatham. 
Clive pleaded that the British government rule over this captured 
land. 


He also proposed sending a couple of thousand royal army soldiers 
who would conquer more land and drive the French out of India. 
Additionally, Indian sepoys could be cheaply hired to do most of the 
actual fighting. 


But Pitt rejected Clive’s pleas. Many British politicians at that time 
believed that it was morally corrupting for the English crown to have 
a land empire in Asia. 

Lecture 24—The British East India Company 
197


Money that Robert Clive took from India made him one of the 
wealthiest men in England and a baron. But in 1772–1773, Parliament 
launched a probing investigation of Clive for corruption, both 
financial and moral. Although he was not convicted, he died a year 
later, at age 49, from either suicide or a heart attack. 
After Clive


These debates about British imperialism continued in London for 
decades. Pitt’s son, William Pitt the Younger, passed the 1784 India 
Act, which forbade exactly what Clive had requested. In order to 
rein in the company, Parliament also created the Board of Control to 
supervise it.


To coordinate all of the East India Company’s policies in India, in 
1772 the company’s directors appointed a governor-general. The 
first governor-general, Warren Hastings (who held the office from 
1772–1785), recognized the value and utility of some Indian men and 
traditions.


Hastings’s policies were known at that time as Orientalist, meaning 
they valued Asian knowledge. But Hastings was simultaneously 
acting as a paternal and self-appointed preserver of Indian traditions.


Hastings also imposed British power onto nearby Indian 
kingdoms. He personally led military expeditions that punished 
resisting Indian rulers. He annexed their territories and made 
himself personally rich. 


But this eventually provided his political opponents in London with 
much evidence against him. On his return to England, the British 
House of Commons impeached him for corruption. He went on trial 
before the House of Lords in 1787. He was not acquitted for nearly 
a decade. 

A History of India
198
Cornwallis


To replace Hastings as governor-general, the British government 
sent a very different type of man: Charles Cornwallis. He came from 
the landed aristocracy and was a career officer in the British royal 
army, best known in America for surrendering at Yorktown in 1781 
to George Washington and his French allies. 


Despite this setback, Cornwallis retained much political influence in 
London. He was appointed governor-general in 1786, just five years 
after his Yorktown surrender.


In India, Cornwallis tried to impose on the Company’s 
administration some of the theories he brought with him. He 
believed Indians were corrupt, and he believed strongly in the 
value of landownership. This followed the then-influential 
French physiocrat school of economics. The central idea was that 
agricultural land grounded every sound economy. 
Surrender of Lord Cornwallis by John Trumbull

Lecture 24—The British East India Company 
199


Cornwallis went to India determined to impose this physiocrat 
economic system on Bengal, even though he knew nothing about 
it before he arrived. He intended to establish a network of Indian 
landlords, like the landed gentry and squires of England, who would 
tend the land, improve agricultural production, and thereby advance 
the whole Indian economy. 


In 1793, he recognized legal ownership rights by a class of Indians 
known as zamindars (“land holders”). They could now buy and sell 
their lands as their personal property. As an incentive to invest in 
improving their land, Cornwallis ordered that the land tax would 
never be raised. This was the Permanent Settlement, since the taxes 
due were “settled permanently.” However, if any landowner failed 
to pay his taxes exactly when they were due, the British would 
auction off his lands.


The Permanent Settlement produced unintended effects. Indian 
zamindars historically did have specific rights over particular lands, 
with the main one being the right to collect taxes for the government 
and keep a share. But other people also had rights to that same land, 
including the farmers who actually did the work plus temples and 
village officials who also received a share of the taxes. 


When the zamindars were legally transformed from landholders into 
landlords, those other parties lost out. Many farmers became tenants 
whom the landlord could now legally expel. Late taxes often meant 
that many estates were auctioned off, and urban-based rich Indian 
merchants purchased them. 
Sub-Imperialist War


Many governors-general sought glory for themselves through sub-
imperialist wars. One of the more aggressive governors-general 
was Lord Richard Wellesley (elder brother of the later Duke of 
Wellington). 

A History of India
200


Wellesley’s generals defeated the ruler of Mysore, Tipu Sultan, 
killing him in 1799. They annexed some of that kingdom and set 
up a puppet ruler over the rest. In 1801, Wellesley annexed half the 
kingdom of the company’s longest subordinate ally, Awadh. 


Wellesley also defeated the Maratha confederacy and made the 
Mughal emperor a palace prisoner, taking much of their lands. But 
London kept scolding him for these wars and annexations, and 
Wellesley had to resign in 1805. 
The Receiving End


Many Indian regional rulers fought battles against the British, but 
few won wars since most could not afford to equip and pay such 
large sepoy armies. Also, they could not match British control over 
the sea. 


Instead, the many different Indian rulers acted in their own 
individual interests, often fighting against each other. Most surviving 
rulers believed that they could do better by cooperating (or seeming 
to cooperate) with the company than by openly opposing it. 


There were substantial classes of officials who did much of the actual 
administration before the company took over. Some of these people 
remained loyal to their Indian rulers, and so faded from power with 
them. Other traditional service elites learned how to adapt to the 
British. They continued to collect taxes, keep records, and make the 
legal system function, except now there were white British officials 
commanding them. 
Ram Mohan Roy


Out of the interactions among these various Indians and Britons 
emerged hybrid systems of government. Often the British Anglicized 
customary Indian procedures and laws. Conversely, many Indians 
Indianized British procedures and laws.

Lecture 24—The British East India Company 
201


We can see some of these processes in the career of one of the most 
remarkable men of his day, Ram Mohan Roy. For a decade (1804–14), 
he worked as an official in the British administration of Bengal, seeing 
how the British functioned from within the system. He then retired at 
age 42 in order to devote himself to improving his own community. 


He led like-minded Indians in the Bengal Renaissance, a cultural 
movement based in Calcutta that strove to modernize Hindu society. 
In 1828, Ram Mohan started a reforming Hindu movement, called the 
Statue of Ram Mohan Roy

A History of India
202
Brahmo Sabha. He found in the ancient Hindu scriptures the model 
of a monotheistic and formless creator god, Brahma, who they could 
worship. 


He put pressure on the government to outlaw the practice of sati, 
where a Hindu widow proved her faithfulness to her late husband 
by killing herself, either on his funeral pyre or later. The governor-
general at that time, Lord William Bentinck, accepted Ram Mohan 
Roy’s advice, and that of British missionaries and officials, and 
ordered sati outlawed in 1829. 
Bentinck’s Policies


In order to make the administration of India as efficient as possible, 
Bentinck reduced its expenses, including the salary of British 
officials. He hired more Indian officials, since he could pay them less 
salary than British men. 


In order to increase the government’s income, Bentinck declared that 
all opium grown in British India had to be sold to the British East 
India Company, at prices it set. This monopoly meant large profits 
when the company auctioned off that opium to British, Indian, 
and American merchants, who then smuggled it into China for the 
growing millions of addicts there. 


Governor-General Bentinck also strongly believed in technological 
progress, encouraging steam navigation on the Ganges River. 
Bentinck abolished flogging in the company’s army, even though 
such whipping as punishment continued in the British army for 
decades. 


But Bentinck’s administration also imposed the Anglicization of the 
government’s educational system for Indians. There had long been 
debates between Anglicists and Orientalists. Anglicists argued 
that English was the language of science and progress, so Indians 
should have to be taught in it. Orientalists believed that Indians 

Lecture 24—The British East India Company 
203
should be educated in their own languages. By “education,” both 
sides really meant the education of a few Indian male elites, not 
mass education. In 1835, under Bentinck, the balance tilted in favor 
of the Anglicists.

Lecture 25
The Issues and Events of 1857
T
hroughout the torrid summer of 1857, across the heart of the north 
Indian Gangetic plain, Indians and Britons clashed viciously. 
Fighting and heartless executions continued for more than a year, 
leaving hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children dead. In 
many ways, these bloody events marked a major turning point in the 
history of India, affecting virtually everyone. It radically reshaped 
relations between Indians and Britons and also the nature of colonial rule 
over India. The historical meanings of these events of 1857 have remained 
heatedly contested ever since. 
An Unusual Army


Over the century leading up to 1857, an unusual colonial army had 
conquered the million and half square miles of India and its 270 
million inhabitants. One distinctive feature is that the army was 
85 percent Indian. That is, the army contained only about 40,000 
Europeans and a quarter of a million Indian soldiers, generally called 
sepoys.


Another distinctive feature of this army was that it was officially part 
of the English East India Company, a joint-stock corporation whose 
official goal was making profits to pay dividends to its shareholders. 
But from the mid-18th century, this company had begun to seize and 
rule vast territories in India.


There were actually three distinct East India Company armies. The 
biggest one was based in Bengal, but there were two smaller armies 
based in Madras and Bombay. The Indians in the Madras and 
Bombay armies remained largely uninvolved in the 1857 fighting, so 
we’ll concentrate on the company’s Bengal army.

205
Sepoy Discontent


This colonial army had become ever more clearly divided along 
racial lines. White and Indian soldiers served separately, never 
mixing except in the heat of battle. The artillery, in particular, was 
considered too technical and powerful in battle to trust to Indians, 
although Indian servants did much of the hard work.


Even in sepoy regiments, Indians could not be promoted higher 
than petty officer, a noncommissioned rank, never in command over 
white soldiers. Moreover, especially in the decade leading up to 1857, 
the financial allowances that had previously been allowed to sepoys 
were being reduced. Sepoys also saw that many of the British officers 
treated them less respectfully. This reflected a growing British sense 
of cultural and racial superiority. 
Depiction of a British officer stopping mutineering Indian soldiers

A History of India
206


Many sepoys resented this situation, especially when their British 
commanding officers used their rank to force Indians to obey orders 
they found disgraceful. For example, some British officers preached 
Christianity to their soldiers, who could not avoid these sermons 
without disobeying orders.
Kingly Discontent


Indian sepoys were not the only ones who rose up against the British 
in 1857. Over the previous century, hundreds of Indian kings had 
been defeated and exiled by the East India Company’s armies. 


The company then annexed their kingdoms on one justification 
or another. Even loyal dynasties were taken over during the 1840s 
and 1850s under the so-called Doctrine of Lapse. This meant that 
the East India Company claimed to inherit the kingdom of any 
Indian ruler who died without a legitimate male heir whom the 
company approved. 


Some of the annexed kingdoms became centers for anti-British 
sentiment and fighting in 1857. Two key examples are Jhansi and 
Awadh.


In 1853, the Hindu king of the small central Indian state of Jhansi 
died, with many wives but only an adopted son. When the Company 
annexed this kingdom for its own administrative convenience under 
the Doctrine of Lapse, the youngest widow, Rani Lakshmi Bai, objected. 
The Company derecognized the adoption and took over Jhansi. 


Rani Lakshmi Bai became one of the most celebrated heroines of the 
1857 fighting, leading her followers into battle. She died of wounds 
suffered fighting nobly against the British. 


In 1856, one of the biggest remaining Indian kingdoms, Awadh, was 
annexed by the company on the grounds of misgovernment. For 
nearly a century, this Shiite Muslim dynasty had been obediently 

Lecture 25—The Issues and Events of 1857 
207
subordinate to the British. It had loaned the East India Company 
vast amounts of money, much of which had never been repaid. 


While the Awadh king was deposed and pensioned in Calcutta, his 
mother, one of his wives, and his brothers went to England to plead his 
case before the British Parliament and Queen Victoria, to no avail. As 
the fighting broke out in 1857, another wife of the ex-king and another 
of his sons became rousing symbols for the forces fighting the British. 
The Fighting Begins



Bengal Army’s 3rd Light Cavalry finally rose up against their British

officers and their wives and children. These Indian soldiers had 
many specific provocations. 


The previous month, 85 of them had been arrested for disobeying 
the direct order to use a new type of rifle, the .577 caliber Enfield 
P-53, a rifle that came with pre-manufactured cartridges in which an 
exactly measured amount of gunpowder, along with the bullet, was 
covered by a greased paper. By biting off the top of this cartridge, 
pouring the gunpowder down the barrel, and then using the rest of 
the cartridge paper as a pre-greased wad, a soldier could fire much 
faster and efficiently, even in the heat of battle. 


Indian soldiers wanted to know the source of the grease on the paper 
that they were putting in their mouths. Many sepoys were sure it 
was made from cow fat, pig fat, or a combination. Putting cow fat 
in your mouth polluted many Hindus, especially the high-caste 
Brahmins and Rajputs. Pig fat offended many Muslim sepoys. The 
British officers claimed it was vegetable oil but in truth did not really 
know.


One Brahmin sepoy, Mangal Pandey, became famous among Indians 
(and infamous among Britons) for his violent resistance to his British 
officers at the Barrackpore base, near Calcutta. He was executed on 
April 8. 


On April 24 in Meerut, when soldiers of the 3rd Light Cavalry 
regiment refused to bite on the greased cartridge as ordered, dozens 
of them were imprisoned, court-martialed for mutiny, and sentenced 
to 10 years of hard labor imprisonment. Faced with this prospect, 
many other Indian soldiers were ready to rise up.


In addition, many of the Indian townspeople of Meerut ridiculed the 
sepoys stationed there for becoming outcastes by serving the British 
and for using polluting new cartridges. They also called the sepoys 
cowards for not liberating their imprisoned comrades. This further 
aroused the Indian soldiers. 

Lecture 25—The Issues and Events of 1857 
209


Early on May 10 the soldiers in Meerut attacked the military prison, 
released their comrades, killed about 50 of their British officers and 
their families, and rushed the 36 miles to Delhi, which they quickly 
captured. 


These Indian soldiers pushed their way into the Red Fort, where the 
82-year-old Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah II was a palace prisoner. 
Although he was reluctant to get involved, they proclaimed him the 
restored ruler over all of India. 


News spread rapidly, sparking uprisings across much of the Ganges 
plain. Britons, including officers, officials, and merchants, as well as 
their families, fled. Hundreds were hunted down and executed or 
imprisoned. Institutions and symbols of the East India Company’s 
government, including prisons, treasuries, post offices, telegraph 
stations, record rooms, and officers’ quarters, were looted and 
destroyed.
British Response


As soon as news of the Meerut uprising and capture of Delhi reached 
British officials, they began to mobilize forces to restore British rule 
across north India. In Bengal, the government intercepted British 
army regiments on their way to China and marched them up the 
Ganges. The British forces began to retake regions and cities they 
had lost. Banaras and Allahabad were retaken in a month. 


In the Punjab, the British had some white regiments. Those few 
Bengal Army sepoy regiments stationed in the Punjab that showed 
signs of discontent were disarmed. The British also began to heavily 
recruit Punjabi Sikh soldiers. 


British officials in Nepal convinced the Gurkha ruler to send his army 
to help restore British rule over north India. British forces recaptured 
Awadh’s capital of Lucknow in March 1858. 

A History of India
210


The northern part of the Deccan remained the last major 
battleground, with Jhansi and Gwalior falling to the British in June 
1858. But some of the scattered Indian leaders, and many sepoys, 
remained in resistance for another year at least.
Brutality and Division


So traumatic were these events that many people involved responded 
brutally. Indian sepoys, peasants, landholders, and bandits killed 
many British men, women, and children. 


As the British forces fought back, they were even more brutal, 
executing tens of thousands of Indians who looked like they might 
have been sepoys or even just sympathizers. In fact, the British army 
often used a particularly gruesome form of execution: tying the 
sentenced man to the front of a cannon loaded only with gunpowder 
and not a cannonball, and then firing it off. 


Much of the strong racial animosity that characterized the later 
British Raj arose from the killings by both sides of people on the 
basis of their race. After 1857, there arose among the British the 
idea that Indians were bloodthirsty killers and threats to the 
sexual purity of white women. Many post-1857 British novels, 
poems, plays, and other works of popular literature featured this 
inflammatory theme.


The British also began to emphasize differences among Indians. Not 
only did the British separate Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs in legal 
terms, they also tried to keep them apart politically. This was the 
British strategy of divide and rule.


After 1857, the British also made major changes in their military and 
political policies. The East India Company armies were substantially 
reorganized. Many longstanding sepoy regiments were demobilized 
and the rest transferred into the new British-Indian army, under the 

Lecture 25—The Issues and Events of 1857 
211
direct command of the British monarch, but still separate from the 
royal British army. 


The new army used the “martial race theory” to punish the 
communities whose sepoys had risen up against the British and also 
to reward those communities that supported them. In particular, the 
high-caste sepoys from Bengal and the central Ganges plain were 
degraded by the British as an allegedly “effeminate race,” unworthy 
of being soldiers. 


In contrast, Nepali Gurkhas, Punjabi Sikhs, and also Muslims from 
the Northwest Frontier region received the new designation “martial 
races.” These regions and communities had supported the British in 
1857.


In November 1858, Queen Victoria’s government took all political 
power in India away from the East India Company, and eventually 
closed it down entirely, paying off its stockholders. The British crown 
became the ruler of India. 


The British and Indian employees of the East India Company now 
worked for the royal government of India, or the British Raj as it is 
popularly known.


Many Britons came to believe that Indians did not deserve the 
benefits of allegedly enlightened British rule. Instead, they felt that 
Indians preferred their so-called natural leaders, who were feudal 
Indian princes. The British Parliament had Queen Victoria issue a 
proclamation promising the more than 600 surviving Indian rulers 
that, unless they had directly fought against the British, they were 
guaranteed to keep their dynasties on their thrones and to maintain 
possession of their territories. 


These Indian “princely states” remained legally independent, with 
the largest of them having British-recognized sovereigns, until 
1947. About a third of the Indian subcontinent’s total territory and 

A History of India
212
a quarter of its people remained officially under the rule of these 
princely states. The largest of these princely states, Hyderabad, was 
about the size of France. 


Any prince who became too independent minded was deposed, 
with a more compliant brother or son put in his place. This was the 
British system of indirect rule, which they developed in India and 
then copied in many other colonies in Asia and Africa.

Lecture 26
The British Raj and Early Nationalism
B
ritish colonial rule over India, known as the British Raj, lasted 
for almost 90 years, until 1947. During that period of “high 
colonialism,” many British men and women worked to create 
institutions that would control India. But these very institutions of 
colonial rule created conditions that led a growing number of Indian men 
and women to strive for their own nation. In this lecture, we’ll begin by 
surveying the structure of British colonial rule over India as it changed 
during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We’ll also see how various 
competing nationalist movements began to develop during this period. 
The Raj Emerges


The British Raj emerged from the aftermath of the fighting of 
1857–58, termed variously the Indian Mutiny, First War for Indian 
Independence, or the People’s Uprising. This bloody conflict in 
India, the 1865 Morant Bay rebellion in Jamaica, and the Maori wars 
in New Zealand (1845–1872) solidified British ideas about race as 
being biological and immutable. 


Since Britain had conquered India and Indians, the reasoning went, 
it must be morally and racially fitter. Many officers and officials of 
the British Raj tried to institutionalize what they considered British 
racial and social superiority. 


After 1857, an array of new British policies developed that were 
designed to prevent the recurrence of the sepoy mutiny and armed 
popular uprising. The British Indian Army replaced the three East 
India Company armies. 

A History of India
214


This army recruited so-called martial races, including Muslims and 
Indian communities that had remained loyal to the British like Sikhs 
and Gurkhas. The sharply marked distinction between white British 
commissioned officers and non-white Indian noncommissioned 
officers and sepoys continued.


In the civil service, the British instituted a similar, racially 
based pattern. After 1858, the white British officials of the East 
India Company became the Indian Civil Service (ICS), which 
administered the two-thirds of India under British direct rule. The 
ICS also indirectly ruled the hundreds of Indian princely states that 
collectively comprised the other third of India. 


Starting in 1863, a few Indian highly Anglicized young men traveled 
to London in order to take the ICS entrance examination. British 
officials made it very difficult for Indians to even take the exam. 
Not only was the examination in English, it was also in Western 
subjects including English, Greek, Latin, Italian, French, and German 
languages and literature. Further, it was only offered in London, so an 
Indian candidate had to travel there and take it in an unfamiliar place. 


Many members of the ICS saw themselves as protecting the simple, 
childlike Indian peasants and much-abused Indian women against 
the morally suspect Indian middle-class men who were allegedly 
constantly exploiting them.

These career ICS officials took great pride in “modernizing” India, 
at least in terms of technology. Telegraphs had begun to transform 
communication, and by 1865, there was even a mostly undersea 
cable laid between India and Britain. 


Other innovations included railways (which enforced racial 
separations) and irrigation canals. Many Britons believed that these 
massive civil engineering projects were proof that science and nature 
had both been mastered by British civilization.

The Two Englands


From the 1830s onward, British colonial government sponsored an 
Anglophone educational system in India that allowed elite Indian 
men to study subjects like English literature, English history, and 
Western-style science. A few of the more enterprising Indian elite 
families began from the early 19th century onward to send their sons 
to England itself for higher education. 


Wherever they studied, these young men were taught about the 
superiority of British culture and England’s traditions of liberty and 
democracy. But gradually some of these Anglicized Indians began to 
question the discrepancy between British humanist ideals and the 
exploitative practices of colonialism.


Jawaharlal Nehru articulated this as the “two Englands.” He 
distinguished between “[t]he England of Shakespeare and Milton, 
of noble speech and writing and brave deed, of political revolution 
and the struggle for freedom, of science and technological progress” 
and “the England of the savage penal code and brutal behaviour, of 
entrenched feudalism and reaction.” 
Challenges to the Raj


By the late 19th century, various Indian people began increasingly to 
challenge the permanence of the British Raj and its racial segregation. 
In 1885, about 70 Indian Anglicized elite men from all over India 
came together in Bombay for what was called the Indian National 
Congress (INC). The man who organized this was Allan Octavian 
Hume, a British former ICS official who believed that Indians should 
begin to play a larger role in governing India. Hume had actually 
been pushed out of the ICS for his relatively liberal views. 


The Indians who assembled in 1885 began to see their nationally 
shared interests for the first time. There had been earlier scattered 
discussions about a possible nation, but hitherto mostly confined 
within specific provinces. 

A History of India
216


Since no single language is shared among India’s various regions, 
English was the common link language among them. With that came 
English concepts like formal resolutions. The early meetings of the 
Indian National Congress passed a few resolutions, but these were 
all intended to contribute to the British Raj, not end it. 


Resolutions included the opportunity to take the ICS examination in 
India so more Indians could serve the British monarch. The viceroy 
declined to implement any of these resolutions. 


Nonetheless, the INC continued to meet annually in one Indian city 
or another. Since the INC proposals were quite general about what the 
Indian nation would be, elite men of various communities participated. 
One Parsi leader, Dadabhai Naoroji, had spent many years in England 
as a merchant and part-time teacher of his native language, Gujarati, 
at University College, London. He also participated in British politics, 
actually winning a seat in the 
British Parliament in 1892. 


One of Naoroji’s insights 
was how Britain had long 
been “draining” India of 
its capital, thereby funding 
the 
British 
industrial 
revolution 
while 
stunting 
Indian development. Naoroji 
brought to the INC great 
insights into British political 
processes. 


Gradually, 
some 
of 
the 
younger, more assertive men 
in the INC began to push 
more strongly for changes in 
the Raj. They were termed 
extremists, 
although 
their 
Dadabhai Naoroji

217
proposals were not actually very radical. This led to an open split in 
the INC during its 1907 meeting in Surat over just how self-governing 
India should be in the future be.
Religion and the Raj


Calcutta in particular was a major center for Indian Hindu leadership, 
especially men who were enriched by the Permanent Settlement of 
1793. So, in 1905, the British Raj divided the Bengal presidency. The 
official reason was administrative convenience, but the effect was to 
separate these Calcutta-based Hindu nationalists from the political 
resources of their landed estates in east Bengal. 


Conversely, in the new province of Eastern Bengal, the large majority 
of the population was Muslim. This split had intentionally opened 
up a protected political space for Muslim leaders. 


In 1906 in Eastern Bengal, a new political party was organized: the 
Muslim League. Many of its leaders were major landlords who 
claimed to be speaking for their Muslim tenants. Thus, the British 
Raj’s policy of “divide and rule” led to a second major elite voice 
along with the INC. The Muslim League’s leaders wanted British 
protection from the Hindu majority.


Further encouraging Muslim separatism, the Raj instituted separate 
electorates for Muslims, where only Muslims could vote and only a 
Muslim candidate could be elected.


The 1905 partition of Bengal, however, mobilized people far more 
widely than the British had anticipated. These rising Indian leaders 
used the concept of swadeshi, meaning “of one’s own land”—that is, 
only products made in India should be purchased. 


In 1911, the British Raj reversed the partition of Bengal (although 
the British would repeat it in 1947). The British deprived the

218
Calcutta-based politicians of their direct influence over the imperial 
government by shifting the capital to New Delhi. 


As a symbol of an eternal British Raj, they built a planned new city 
adjacent to the old Mughal capital of Shahjahanabad, now renamed 
Old Delhi. So, instead of Bengalis in Calcutta, now north Indians in 
the region around Delhi, including many Muslim leaders there, had 
direct influence over the colonial government.
War


Britain declared war on Germany in 1914, and declared India at war 
too. The British government did not consult Indians but expected 
them to pour their manpower and resources into World War I. This 
forced many Indian nationalist politicians to decide whether they 
had a moral duty to support the empire when it went to war. 


Many, including Mohandas Gandhi, did so, since they were 
demanding the rights due citizens of the British Empire and 

Lecture 26—The British Raj and Early Nationalism 
219
therefore felt that they were obliged to defend it. Gandhi and other 
Indian leaders encouraged the recruitment of Indian soldiers to go 
fight in Europe. 


In all, almost 1.7 million Indian soldiers, plus many military laborers, 
volunteered to support the British. This was nearly 20 percent of the 
entire global British imperial army. These Indians fought in Europe 
and the Middle East. Recruitment came widely across India, thereby 
discrediting the British pretense that there were martial and effeminate 
Indian races. Further, many more Indians became officers, taking on 
more authority since there were fewer white British officers available.


Many Indians suffered during this war. More than 130,000 Indian 
soldiers were either killed or wounded. The Indian economy was 
also greatly affected as it supplied food, clothing, and money to 
desperate England. 


The British rhetoric designed to mobilize popular support for the war, 
calling it a war for democracy, encouraged many Indians to expect it 
for themselves. They were also encouraged by promises by President 
Woodrow Wilson about postwar national self-determination. So, 
at the armistice, many Indians had a growing sense that they had 
earned self-government, at least, if not total independence. 


But many British politicians wanted instead to return to a renewed 
British Raj in India. Instead of rewarding India, the British Raj put 
into place continued restrictions like the Rowlatt Acts of 1919, which 
authorized arrest and detention without trial. 


Other brutal British actions included the Jallianwala Bagh massacre 
in the Punjab. In the city of Amritsar, nearly 400 innocent Indians 
were killed and another 1,100 seriously wounded when the British 
officer Reginald Dyer ordered them shot in a confined square. 


During the interwar years, many more Indians got involved in 
politics due to British acts of coercion as well as developing Indian

220
leadership. A range of Indian leaders arose who mobilized different 
constituencies around different models for the nation to come. 


By the time of World War II, India had moved closer to independence. 
That war repeated some of the processes of World War I. This time, 
about 2.5 million Indian soldiers joined the British Indian Army, 
which expanded to 10 times its prewar size. A few Indians were able 
to become commissioned officers. 


These Indian forces fought in Europe as well as in Asia defending the 
British Empire. Indian taxpayers also contributed greatly, by choice 
or by compulsion. Distressed Britain barely saved itself and could 
no longer hold on to India or many of its other widespread colonies. 
Independence came in 1947, but the bitter conflicts over the shape of 
the nation, or nations, that emerged would continue.

Lecture 27
India and Indians in the World
M
ost studies of Indian history, appropriately enough, concentrate 
on India itself. But we should also consider the long history of 
how Indian people and cultures extended into the wider world 
beyond the subcontinent. In this lecture, we’ll start with a brief look at the 
pre-colonial period, highlighting a few illustrative examples of India’s 
significant effects on other parts of Asia. Then we’ll turn to the growing 
movement of Indians across the globe, especially from the beginning of 
the colonial period up to the early 20th century. 
Early Movements


The earliest human migrations from Africa spread into India about 
60,000 to 70,000 years ago. These initial migrations eastward then 
continued as humans extended from India into Southeast and East 
Asia. 


By 3,000 years ago, people living along the shores of the Indian 
Ocean began to build boats that could brave the sea. Relatively 
soon afterward, Indian Ocean mariners discovered the predictable 
monsoon winds that made longer, more reliable voyages far from 
land possible. 


To the west, dhows and other types of sailing ships moved people 
and cargoes extensively among east Africa, Arabia, Iran, and India. 
To the east, monsoon-powered ships linked India with coastal 
Southeast Asia and China. 


We can see evidence of these exchanges in the biological and cultural 
heritage of various communities throughout the Indian Ocean 
region. For example, there are many Indian merchants who over the 

A History of India
222
centuries settled up and down the east African coast, establishing 
communities in Zanzibar and many other major trading ports there. 


Additionally, there are clearly east African–descended groups 
that have long been living within India, most notably the Siddi 
community in today’s Gujarat and Maharashtra coastal regions. 


Looking east, cultural exchanges have also flourished since ancient 
times. For instance, Hindu and Buddhist religious movements that 
started in India inspired massive monuments and vital traditions 
within local societies and kingdoms throughout Southeast Asia. 
Indonesia still boasts of its shadow puppets that enact the 4th-century 
Indian Hindu epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata. On Java, there 
is the vast 9th-century Buddhist temple complex at Borobudur. 


Muslim merchants, holy men, and conquerors from Arabia reached 
western India in the 8th century, soon after the emergence of Islam. 
Indian Muslims carried the message of the Prophet Muhammad 
with them as they traded, preached, and ruled throughout coastal 
Southeast Asia.


When we consider the passes through the mountains in India’s 
northwest, we find many different groups emigrating and 
immigrating during much of human history. For example, small 
groups of Indian merchants, philosophers, mercenaries, and their 
wives went along to Greece and Egypt with the retreating armies of 
Alexander the Great in the 4th century B.C.E. 


Many more Indians also moved west out of India over subsequent 
centuries. For instance, monks and merchants carried the teachings 
of Gautama Buddha from India into Afghanistan from the 3rd century 
B.C.E. onward. 


Other types of Indians also migrated westward. For instance, the 
nomadic Roma people migrated from northwest India around the 5th 

Lecture 27—India and Indians in the World 
223
century. The Roma now number 11 million people in Europe alone, 
mostly in Romania and Bulgaria.
European Arrivals


Starting in 1498, the arrival of European ships really began to 
integrate Indians into a truly global system. Not only did Indian 
products increasingly go worldwide on European ships, Indian men 
and women of all social classes did as well. 


From the early 16th century onward, some of the Portuguese ships 
returning from India around the tip of South Africa brought a few 
Indians back to Europe. Many were Indians who had converted 
to Roman Catholicism and served the church, the king, or elite 
Portuguese families. 


From the early 17th century onward, northern Europeans, in particular 
the English East India Company, sent larger and more frequent ships 
to India than had the Portuguese. This greatly increased the flow of 
many different types of Indian men and women going to Europe, 
especially to Britain, and back.

A History of India
224
Lascars


During the 17th century, about half the ships that left England for 
India never returned home, being sunk by storms or shipwrecked on 
uncharted shores. Those European vessels that did reach India often 
faced severe maritime labor shortages. In the Indian Ocean, large 
numbers of European sailors died from disease or violence, or they 
deserted to seek their individual fortunes ashore. 


To replace them, European sea captains hired growing numbers of 
Indian seamen, known as lascars. During the 17th and 18th centuries, 
these lascars customarily received higher wages than did European 
sailors, so desperate were the European captains for replacement 
manpower for the voyage back to Europe. 


By the 1850s, several thousand lascars annually disembarked in 
London’s docklands. Most lascars only remained in England for a 
few months until they sailed back to India again. But hundreds 
settled in cities and villages across Britain, sometimes for a few years, 
many for the rest of their lives. 


After steamships replaced sailing vessels from the mid-19th century 
onward, the status of these lascars changed. British maritime labor 
unions and government regulations restricted the employment of 
Indian seamen and lowered the wages that they received relative to 
European sailors. Many Indians no longer sailed as skilled seamen 
but rather as stokers shoveling coal in the sweltering engine room or 
as servants for the passengers and crew. 
Servants


Another growing class of Indians who went to Britain temporarily 
or permanently were thousands of male and female servants. Indian 
servants who went to Britain were not slaves, but rather working-
class people who agreed to go. 

Lecture 27—India and Indians in the World 
225


Most servants eventually left Britain, often working for Britons 
on the voyage back to India. A substantial number of them made 
multiple trips to Europe over their lifetimes, so they knew what to 
expect there. About half were women. Many worked as ayahs, or 
nursemaids, looking after the children of their European employers. 


From the 17th until the early 19th century, Indian servants were 
quite expensive to bring to Britain, so they added much rare, exotic 
prestige to their employer’s household. Thereafter, steamships and 
changing British government regulations made Indian servants more 
common, and therefore less valued. 


As British colonialism expanded from the mid-18th century onward, 
increasing numbers of the Indian wives, mistresses, or children of 
Europeans went back to Europe with them. They soon merged into 
European society.
Diplomats


Mughal emperors and other Indian rulers also sent embassies to 
London. By the 1850s, there had been 30 of these Indian diplomatic 
missions, some with hundreds of Indians in them, mostly servants 
supporting the ambassador. Several of these ambassadors or their 
attendants wrote down book-length accounts of their political and 
personal experiences there.


In their writing for fellow elite male Indian readers, many of these 
visitors repeatedly commented about their relatively free social 
mixing with British women of their own social class. This was a level 
of socializing that they would not have permitted between their own 
womenfolk and European male visitors in India. 


These accounts by early Indian visitors also uniformly remarked at 
how uninformed and parochial the British public were at that time. 
These Indian authors gave examples of how crowds of mystified 

A History of India
226
but well-disposed Britons gathered around them whenever they 
appeared in public wearing Indian clothing. 
Laborers


There was a small trade in Indian slaves until the early 19th century, 
when the British outlawed the slave trade internationally. Thereafter, 
the British used Indian prisoners as workers in many of its colonies. 


The largest number of Indians, about 30 million men and women, 
went overseas as manual laborers under the indentured labor system. 
Their contracts gave the worker a cash advance and provided sea 
passage to where he or she would work. The indentured laborer had 
to work at low wages to repay the advance, usually for five or seven 
years. 


The original indentured laborers were actually Europeans during 
the 17th and 18th centuries. Europeans continued to emigrate by 
indenture until the early 19th century when the system largely ended 
for Europeans.


But with the end of European indentured labor and the 1833 British 
legal ending of the intercontinental slave trade, a demand for new 
sources for large numbers of cheap worker arose. 


Such manual laborers were especially needed by European-owned 
sugar plantations in Ceylon (now called Sri Lanka), Burma (now 
called Myanmar), Malaya, Fiji, the Caribbean, Mauritius and 
Reunion islands, and south and east Africa. Europeans and freed 
African slaves generally refused such poorly paid and dangerous 
employment, as did the local population. 


However, periodic famines and political upheavals—including from 
El Nino–related droughts and India’s 1857 uprising—drove many 
Indians and other Asians to emigrate as free or indentured labor. 

Lecture 27—India and Indians in the World 
227


After they reached the overseas plantations, many indentured 
laborers worked under conditions as horrific as slavery. The 
indentures could be bought and sold, and the laborers had to work 
for whoever owned them. If they broke their indenture, the British 
classed it as a criminal act, not a civil contract violation, so the police 
enforced their bondage. 


Nonetheless, unlike transatlantic slaves, the children of indentured 
immigrants were legally born free, although their parents might 
indenture them. 


While most Indian indentured immigrants were men, many of the 
receiving governments and plantations preferred families in order to 
create more stable worker communities. Immigrants who completed 
their indenture legally had the option of return passage home, but 
many chose to stay on as free settlers. 
Indian Elites


From the mid-19th century onward, growing numbers of ambitious 
Indian elite families sent their sons to Britain for professional 
educations, like law or medicine. Some went to take the examination 
that gained them entry into the prestigious Indian Civil Service. Far 
fewer Indian women went, even from elite families. 


Overall, these 19th and early 20th century Indian students generally 
encountered less strong racial prejudice in Britain than they 
endured in India. The British Raj in India depended on strong racial 
separation. However, since there were so many fewer Indians living 
in Britain, that society felt less threatened. Further, the strong class 
differences prevailing in Britain meant that elite Indian men stood 
higher than many working-class British men and women. 


By living in England, these young Indians gained a better 
understanding of their colonial rulers. They studied British liberal 
movements and the humanistic values held by many Britons. These 

A History of India
228
Indian students and visitors learned firsthand about Parliamentary 
government and representative democracy. Some who lived there 
long enough could vote in British elections. 


A few, starting in 1841, were elected to the British Parliament by 
English constituencies. A range of movements for socialism or 
progressive Christianity were attractive to British youth, and many 
of these movements welcomed Indian supporters and members. 


Middle- and upper-class Indian men and women also saw how 
European imperialism affected not just their home colony but other 
non-white colonies around the world. They learned from strong 
European critics of British imperialism like Karl Marx. All this made 
them aware of their own humanity and rights as citizens, which 
contrasted with their position in British colonies as oppressed racial 
inferiors. 


Therefore, many of the early Indian and African anticolonial 
nationalists actually studied in Britain. For example, at age 16, 
Jawaharlal Nehru, later India’s first and longest-serving prime 
minister, went to Harrow, an elite England private school. Nehru 
went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in natural science from 
Cambridge University, and qualified for law school in London.

Lecture 28
Mahatma Gandhi
F
ew people in all of human history are as famous, admired, and 
imitated as Mohandas “Mahatma” Gandhi. Within India, most 
people consider him the father of the nation. In this lecture, we’ll 
consider Mohandas Gandhi as he lived in four distinct worlds, each during 
a different period of his life. First, we’ll explore Gandhi’s youth, spent in 
India under British colonial rule. Next, we’ll follow Gandhi to London, 
where he went to train as a lawyer and also to study English manners. 
Then we’ll travel with Gandhi to South Africa, his third world, where he 
remained for over 20 years. Finally, we’ll follow Gandhi back to India. This 
was a very different world from what he had left decades earlier.
Gandhi’s Roots


For three generations, Gandhi’s male ancestors had served as prime 
ministers of small coastal kingdoms in the western Indian region 
of Gujarat. He himself was born in 1869 in the small kingdom of 
Porbandar. 


Gandhi’s own father was the chief minister of this kingdom. He 
served under the maharaja of Porbandar, one of the more than 600 
remaining Indian rulers who were really under the power of the 
British Raj.


The British conquered India mainly by force, but they ruled over 
Indians in large measure by convincing them of British racial 
and cultural superiority. Hindus like Gandhi’s family had felt 
themselves inferior, not only to the white Christian British but also 
to the Muslim kings who had ruled much of India for hundreds of 
years before the British. 

A History of India
230


Gandhi followed his family’s 
custom 
and 
entered 
an 
arranged 
marriage 
at 
16. 
Although the couple’s first 
son died at birth, they soon 
had two other sons. But 
Gandhi determined to leave 
them all behind in order to 
improve himself. 
Gandhi in London


At age 18, Gandhi traveled 
to London to study law 
and become an Anglicized 
gentleman. During Gandhi’s 
three years in Britain, he had 
three major projects. 


First, 
he 
enrolled 
to 
become 
qualified 
as 
a barrister, the British 
term for the highest-
status lawyers who could 
appear before a judge in 
court. Gandhi needed to 
pay and attend 72 meals in one of the Inns of the Court over a 
three-year period, and take two simple examinations.


Second, Gandhi worked to become as Anglicized as he could. 
In practice, students of the law were supposed to pay a fee to 
apprentice with a working barrister. This Gandhi did not do. 
Instead, he spent his time and limited funds trying to become an 
English-style gentleman. He studied dancing, violin, and French 
but mastered none.


Third, he wanted to explore his own identity and place in both 
his Indian heritage and in the world of London.
Gandhi

Lecture 28—Mahatma Gandhi 
231


He described his several dates with British women as failures, since 
he always lost his nerve. He revealed that he was married as a way 
to get out of one such relationship. 
Gandhi in South Africa


When Gandhi returned to his family at age 21, he found he actually 
knew little about how to practice law. The first and only time he 
found a client and tried to represent her in court, he could only 
stammer and rushed out in disgrace. 


Finding no place for himself in India after his very expensive 
education in London, Gandhi left and did not return there to live 
for more than 20 years. Moving to South Africa at age 24, Gandhi 
entered his third world. 


At that time, there were four separate governments in South Africa. 
In the interior were the two countries of Transvaal and the Orange 
Free State. Both were settled and ruled by white Afrikaners, also 
known as Boers, meaning “farmer” in Afrikaans. In the southwest 
was the British-ruled Cape Colony. And on the eastern coast, along 
the Indian Ocean, was the British-ruled colony of Natal, with Durban 
as its capital. 


Natal had many sugar plantations. After the slave trade ended, 
plantations began to import Indian indentured laborers. By the time 
Gandhi arrived, there were about 40,000 Indians in Natal, counting 
both those under indenture and those who were free laborers.	


When Gandhi first went to South Africa, the legal system of racial 
segregation and inequality was just beginning. This later became 
the apartheid system. To keep Indians from becoming free, the 
government doubled the length of the indenture from 5 to 10 years. 
The government levied a new special tax on all Indians, which was 
almost impossible for free but working-class Indians to pay. 

A History of India
232


Gandhi mobilized peaceful but forceful protests using his growing 
experience as a public speaker. These protests got the government to 
reduce this tax by almost 90 percent, and it was eventually repealed. 


New laws required non-white people to live in certain designated 
areas of towns and cities, and have a passbook signed by a white 
man before they could leave those areas. Gandhi stayed on in South 
Africa for over 20 years in order to oppose each of these early 
apartheid laws. He devoted himself to campaigns of petitioning and 
letter writing, to writing for and starting newspapers, and to fighting 
each law in court. 


Over time, Gandhi brought almost all the Indians into an 
organization he formed, called the Natal Indian Congress. A few 
sympathetic whites also supported him. 
Satyagraha


Gradually, Gandhi developed his most famous practice of nonviolent 
noncooperation with injustice. This is sometimes called passive 
resistance, although Gandhi eventually rejected that term as not 
active enough. 


Because this concept was so new, Gandhi held a contest to invent 
a name for it. The term satyagraha won. Satya means “truth,” in 
the largest sense, while agraha comes from the same word root as 
“grasp.” Therefore, satyagraha literally means “grasp truth.” Never 
submit to untruth or injustice. 


Using satyagraha, Gandhi opposed each apartheid law by 
deliberately breaking it. He led nonviolent marches and sit-ins. 
Gandhi and his arrested followers eventually filled up the jails, so 
they had to be let out to make room for more protesters. Gandhi did 
not win many of these struggles, but he managed to force the British 
colonial government to modify some of these laws for the Indian 
community.

Lecture 28—Mahatma Gandhi 
233
Complications


One issue that arose from Gandhi’s career in South Africa was the 
contrast between his dedicated commitment to the Indian community 
and his limited involvement with the much larger community of 
black Africans living around him. Many Indian symbols Gandhi 
used meant nothing to black African cultures, and a language barrier 
existed as well. 


Plus, the racial segregation laws reinforced the separation between 
Indians and black Africans. While Gandhi’s Natal Indian Congress 
inspired the later African National Congress, which some Indians 
joined, tensions continued in South Africa between the Indians who 
remained there and the much larger majority of black Africans.


Another issue was Gandhi’s relationship to his wife and four 
surviving sons. How should any leader who is totally committed his 
community, and to all the people within it equally, treat his own wife 
and children? Gandhi’s decision was to reject many of the personal 
demands on him from his family. 


This led to some strains in his relationships with his wife and 
each son. For example, he insisted that all jewelry given to her by 
supporters be used only for the movement. He denied his sons 
the advanced Anglicized education that he had received and then 
devalued as immoral. 
Return to India


At age 46, Gandhi decided to return home to India, where he felt 
he could do more to help his people. The Indian National Congress 
was the most prominent Indian political movement when Gandhi 
returned. It mainly represented the interests of its elite male members 
and had not yet accomplished much.

A History of India
234


Gandhi quickly rose to lead a younger and more active generation in 
the Indian National Congress. Significantly, Gandhi broadened the 
orginzation’s support base. 


Just two years after he returned to India, Gandhi went to a remote 
region of north India, called Champaran, to support farmers of indigo 
in their strike against the British plantation owners. The farmers had 
taken loans, but then the price of indigo had fallen. German-invented 
chemicals could produce blue dye much less expensively. The Indian 
farmers could not repay the loans. 


Gandhi encouraged the Indian farmers to hold out against the 
demands of the British owners. When he refused to back down and 
was arrested, Gandhi used his own trial to bring attention to the 
farmers’ plight. 

Lecture 28—Mahatma Gandhi 
235


Intelligently, he used police agents who were recording evidence 
against him by making them witnesses of abuses by the British 
owners. He then negotiated a compromise that both Indian farmers 
and British could accept. 


Later that same year, Gandhi went to Ahmedabad, the capital of 
his home province of Gujarat, to support Indian textile workers in 
their strike. British taxes had suppressed the once thriving Indian 
cloth-weaving industry. Instead, almost all Indians bought British-
manufactured cloth, often made from Indian raw cotton that had 
been shipped to Britain and woven there. 


Only a few Indian cloth factories existed, and this strike was by 
Indian workers against Indian factory owners. When plague had hit 
the city, the factory owners had raised wages to keep workers on the 
job. After the plague subsided, the owners wanted to lower wages to 
their former level, leading the workers to strike. 


Gandhi told the workers that to end the strike without success 
would be an injustice, and vowed to fast until death if they did so. 
This was the first of his many public fasts. Impressed by Gandhi’s 
commitment to take suffering upon himself rather than accept 
injustice, both sides compromised. 
Symbolism


During his career in India, Gandhi proved particularly astute in 
evoking powerful symbols, especially ones he shared with the vast 
majority of the population who were also Hindu. 


His most popular title, Mahatma, literally means “Great Soul.” This 
was given by popular acclaim to Gandhi, and also to many other 
holy men in the Hindu tradition. His core concept of nonviolence 
and his powerful tactic of the public fast both came out of the high 
Hindu tradition. But the symbols and ideas he used to mobilize the 
majority of the population failed to attract sizable minorities.

237
Rejection


About 20 percent of India’s population were men and women 
traditionally classed as untouchables or outcastes. These people lived 
in small hamlets scattered everywhere in India, doing the necessary 
but dirty work of sanitation, leatherworking, and other services. 


Gandhi tried to lift these people out of their degraded status, 
renaming their community Harijans, literally, the “Beloved of God 
Vishnu.” But some leaders of this community regarded Gandhi as an 
outsider who was trying to speak for them. 


Another large minority that increasingly rejected Gandhi’s leadership 
was the quarter of the Indian population that was Muslim. British 
laws intensified the distinctions and tensions between Muslim 
Indians and Hindu Indians. 


The Muslim League was a political party founded to represent 
separate Muslim interests. The split between the Indian National 
Congress and the Muslim League ultimately led to the partition of 
colonial India into the separate independent nations of the secular 
Republic of India and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1947. 


However, Gandhi worked until the end of his life building peace 
between the two religious communities and then the two nations. 
In 1948, a Hindu nationalist assassinated Gandhi for being too 
sympathetic of Muslims.

Lecture 29
Nationalists Ambedkar, Bose, and Jinnah
D
uring the first half of the 20th century, as India began to emerge 
from colonialism, a range of people worked to assert many 
competing models for their nation to come. Mohandas Gandhi 
was the most famous of these. However, in this lecture, we’ll consider 
some of the major alternative models and means by looking at the careers 
and ideas of three significant leaders, each of whom opposed Gandhi 
over fundamental issues: Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra 
Bose, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. 
Ambedkar


Being born as a so-called untouchable, even in the late 19th century, 
almost certainly meant a life of degradation. Yet a combination of 
ability and opportunity enabled Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar to lead 
his community and his emerging nation forward.


Ambedkar was a Mahar by jati. Mahars traditionally worked as 
untouchable village servants. In their homeland of western India, 
Mahars are one of the largest communities. So, when full democracy 
was implemented and people could vote freely, each with an equal 
vote, Mahars collectively achieved substantial electoral power. 
Ambedkar is widely credited for gaining this power for Mahars and 
other ex-untouchables. 


Because of his father’s position in the army, Ambedkar could attend 
state primary school. However, most teachers and other students 
treated him as an untouchable. Nonetheless, he was able to gain 
admission to secondary school and graduate, one of the first in his 
family to do so. He then graduated from Bombay University, again 
as a pathbreaker for his entire community.

Lecture 29—Nationalists Ambedkar, Bose, and Jinnah 
239


The local Indian prince of Baroda awarded Ambedkar a small 
scholarship in 1913 to study at Columbia University in the U.S. This 
made Ambedkar the absolutely first of his entire community to get 
an advanced, post-graduate education.

240


On his return to India, Ambedkar faced discrimination while 
working for the princely administration of Baroda and then in a 
faculty position in a business school in Bombay. He eventually began 
work as a political leader and lawyer, using the British-run courts 
to defend his people. He started social reform movements. He also 
became an influential journalist, using the developing print media 
to publish articles, journals, pamphlets, and books in English and his 
native Marathi language, demanding civil rights for his community.
Gandhi and Ambedkar


Ambedkar remained convinced that Hinduism could not free itself 
from caste discrimination. In this, he clashed with Gandhi. For 
Gandhi, the degrading Hindu practices of untouchability were 
morally wrong. He worked with Ambedkar to enable untouchables 
to enter Hindu temples and to get access to public water sources, 
for example. But Gandhi believed it was higher-caste people who 
needed to change and start treating all people as full human beings. 


Ambedkar 
advocated 
for 
separate 
electorates 
where 
only 
untouchables could vote and only an untouchable candidate could 
win. Muslims had gained political power from such separate 
electorates since 1909, so untouchables should have them, too.


Gandhi adamantly opposed Ambedkar’s demand since separate 
electorates only divided what should be a unified India. When 
Ambedkar insisted and the British concurred, Gandhi went on a 
public fast until death against this.


Reluctantly, Ambedkar gave ground. He and Gandhi negotiated the 
Poona Pact of 1932. This reserved 18 percent of voting districts for 
untouchables, where only an untouchable candidate could win—but 
everyone except Muslims voted in those constituencies. Therfore, 
the winning untouchable candidate had to appeal to the majority of 
the voters who were not untouchables. Gandhi stopped his fast, but 
Ambedkar never reconciled with him. 

Lecture 29—Nationalists Ambedkar, Bose, and Jinnah 
241
Independent India


After independence was achieved, Ambedkar led the committee 
that drafted the new Indian constitution. He made sure that 
untouchability was absolutely forbidden. He could not change the 
Poona Pact, but the new constitution continued the special quotas in 
government employment and state education for untouchables, as 
well as the quotas for Adivasi forest-dwellers.


In the first independent Indian government, Ambedkar served as 
law minister. He made sure that these constitutionally guaranteed 
rights were actually enforced. But in 1951, he left government to 
devote himself full-time to journalism and social activism for his 
community.


Ambedkar believed that Hinduism was never going to change, so he 
determined to renounce it. Just months before his death, Ambedkar 
converted to Buddhism. Its theology promised status based on 
personal achievement, not birth. Ambedkar led half a million of his 
followers, mostly Mahars, in a dramatic public mass conversion to 
Buddhism in 1956. Many millions more converted later. 


The struggles by ex-untouchables continue, nearly 60 years after 
Ambedkar’s death. Today, many in his community call themselves 
Dalit, meaning the “ground-down ones.” Like the American Black 
Panther movement, there was a Dalit Panther movement, with 
powerful poetry and other cultural assertions of their distinctive 
identity.


Ambedkar, fondly called Babasaheb, remains a celebrated hero to 
many Dalit movements and political parties. In statues and images 
of him, he is almost always portrayed in a British-style suit and 
tie, wearing glasses, to show how he used modern education and 
universal civil rights law for the advancement of his people.

A History of India
242
Subhas Chandra Bose


Subhas Chandra Bose became a leading advocate for violence as the 
only effective way to expel the British and simultaneously restore 
Indian self-esteem. Bose came from a professional Bengali family. 


With the support of the more militant members of the Indian 
National Congress party, Bose was elected its president in 1938. 
While he continued to differ from Gandhi regarding violence, Bose 
was reelected the next year. But then Gandhi used his own influence 
to block Bose’s policies and forced him to resign. 


Instead, Bose formed the All-India Forward Bloc within the Indian 
National Congress party, demanding immediate independence. He 
also argued that only a 20-year-long authoritarian “iron dictatorship” 
would purge Indian society of its problems, like the escalating 
Hindu-Muslim conflicts.


During World War II, Bose asserted that Indians should take 
advantage of British weakness. In 1941, he dramatically escaped 
from house arrest in Calcutta. He traveled in disguise through 
Afghanistan to Moscow and then on to Rome and then Berlin. 


With Hitler’s support, Bose started broadcasting radio messages 
to India, calling for a violent revolution against the British Raj. In 
August 1942, there were mass uprisings by Indian workers and 
peasants in the “Quit India” movement that Gandhi had initiated 
but which more violent leaders were enflaming. 


Bose also arranged with the German military high command to let 
him organize Indian prisoners of war to fight against the British 
as the Free Indian Legion. While some of the few thousand Indian 
Legion soldiers did defend France against the Allies, they were too 
small in number to make much of a military contribution to the Axis 
war effort. 

Lecture 29—Nationalists Ambedkar, Bose, and Jinnah



In 1943, Bose traveled by German submarine around the southern 
tip of Africa to rendezvous with a Japanese submarine. The Japanese 
had captured some 70,000 Indian soldiers, many of them abandoned 
by their British officers when Singapore fell suddenly in early 1942. 


The Japanese then released about 40,000 of these prisoners of war so 
they could form the Indian National Army and invade India under 
Bose’s command. He also gained much support from Indians living 
in Burma, which the Japanese had also captured. 


While small parts of India fell to the Indian National Army, the war 
was already entering its final stages. The Indian National Army took 
heavy losses. When the Japanese finally surrendered unconditionally 
in August 1945, so did the Indian National Army. 


Bose himself tried to escape to continue the war of liberation, only 
to have his overloaded plane crash in Taiwan. Some Indians still see 
him as the inspiring figure for India’s modern future as a militarily 
and economically strong world power. This is far from the model of 
India that Gandhi wanted. 


Bose’s vision has increasingly been achieved in the last few decades. 
After all, the Indian army is the third largest in the world. India has 
fought four wars with its neighbors, and it is armed with nuclear 
weapons. Further, India is an emerging global economic power. All 
this is much closer to Bose’s vision than to Gandhi’s.
Muhammad Ali Jinnah


Even more disappointing for Gandhi during his last years was seeing 
India violently divided into two separate nations that immediately 
began fighting. The man widely given credit, or blame, for opposing 
Gandhi and creating Pakistan is Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He was a 
much more successful lawyer than Gandhi. 

Lecture 29—Nationalists Ambedkar, Bose, and Jinnah 
245


At 29, Jinnah joined the 
young 
Indian 
National 
Congress 
(INC), 
even 
before Gandhi had done 
so. Jinnah was among the 
most 
articulate 
members 
of the INC and one of the 
few Muslims in it. He rose 
quickly into its leadership. 
In 1909, Jinnah was elected 
to the Muslim reserved seat 
for Bombay on the advisory 
Indian Legislative Council. 


Jinnah did not join the 
Muslim League until 1913, 
seven years after it was 
founded. Most of the leaders 
of the Muslim League were 
rich 
landholders. 
They 
recognized that only Jinnah 
had the political and legal 
skills to advance their cause. Just three years after he joined the 
Muslim League, Jinnah was elected its president.


As a leading member of both the INC and the Muslim League, 
Jinnah pushed for coordinated policies. The INC and Muslim League 
held joint sessions in 1915 and 1916. Under Jinnah’s leadership, 
they formalized this cooperation in the Lucknow Pact of 1916. In 
Hindu majority provinces, Muslims would receive disproportionate 
legislative representation, and vice versa.


Jinnah advocated at that time for their united goal of being part of one 
nation, although there needed to be legal and political protections for 
the Muslim minority community within free India.
Muhammad Ali Jinnah

246


However, Jinnah felt ever less respected in the INC. Gandhi 
mobilized much support from India’s countryside, in part by evoking 
Hindu symbols. He also tried to be incorporative of all religious 
traditions. As Gandhi’s influence over the INC rose, Jinnah realized 
that his own vision for the future was no longer being supported. 
He resigned in 1920. Then, in 1930, Jinnah retired from politics. He 
moved to London for the next four years, where he developed a 
lucrative legal practice.


The 1935 Government of India Act led to the first provincial elections 
in 1937, with a wider but still limited electorate, only one-sixth of the 
Indian adult population. Much to the Muslim League’s dismay, the 
INC won over half the seats and formed governments in 8 of British 
India’s 11 provinces. 


Muslim League candidates won less than a quarter of the separate 
legislative seats reserved for Muslims. Rather than honor the 
Lucknow Pact, the INC proclaimed that this election showed how 
unpopular and undeserving of power the Muslim League was. 


Jinnah had been called back out of retirement to rescue the 
Muslim League, but not in time to avoid the election debacle of 
1937. However, during the years of World War II, the INC-backed 
ministries all resigned since the British viceroy had declared India at 
war against Germany and then Japan. 


Many of the INC leaders were jailed for much of the war. During that 
time, under Jinnah’s leadership, the Muslim League supported the 
British government and earned political rewards as a result. 


As negotiations for independence proceeded during and after 
the war, Jinnah drove hard bargains with the last viceroy, Lord 
Mountbatten, and the INC leaders. All efforts at compromise failed 
and Pakistan was partitioned out of India in August 1947.

Lecture 30
The Partition of 1947
I
n August 1947, the British Empire withdrew its rule over South 
Asia and partitioned its colony into two new nations: India in the 
center and Pakistan with one wing in the west and the other 1,000 
miles away in the east. This British withdrawal was far too late for 
many people, and abruptly too soon for others. While many people in 
South Asia had long been demanding that the British quit India, the 
births in August 1947 of the separate nations of India and Pakistan were 
nonetheless sudden and traumatic. 
World War II


Throughout World War II, the British demanded great sacrifices from 
India, but provided little in return other than vague promises for the 
postwar future. Some 2.5 million Indian soldiers served the British 
Empire, comprising about 20 percent of all its armed forces. Many 
of them returned with military training and an awareness that they 
were as martial as Europeans, and not racially inferior. 


The British war effort demanded vast amounts of clothing, 
equipment, and food from India, taken with little concern for the 
effects on the Indian economy or people. The 1943 famine in Bengal 
became tragic proof that British policies prioritized its wartime goals 
over the lives of Indians. 


As the imperial Japanese army began to invade the frontiers of India 
along its border with Burma, the British government confiscated 
grain and boats in its path. Many millions of people began to starve. 
Of these, about 3 million people died, mostly in rural areas. 

Lecture 30—The Partition of 1947 
249


Further, throughout most of World War II, the British imprisoned 
many in the Indian National Congress high command, including 
Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohandas Gandhi. That greatly contributed 
to a weakening of the INC’s control over popular anti-British 
sentiment. 


On the left, the Communist Party of India lost credibility during 
the war when it was directed by Stalin first to support Hitler and 
then to support Russia’s British allies. However, other leftists 
worked hard to liberate their Indian nation. Especially in August 
1942, there were widespread, and often violent, uprisings in many 
regions. 


In Bihar, for example, 170 police stations, post offices, other 
government buildings were destroyed. But there were large numbers 
of British troops stationed in India, which was the major staging base 
for the war in the Pacific. The British colonial government used these 
troops to crush many such popular movements. 


On the right, the war proved an opportunity for the hundreds of 
Indian princes to prove their loyalty to the British with manpower 
and financial and political support. 


Hindu nationalists also expanded their support during the war. 
Their use of religious symbols like the Mother Goddess mobilized 
large numbers of Hindu supporters into political action. But in the 
process, they alienated many Muslims. 


The Hindu Mahasabha political party started in 1909. The 
membership in this party overlapped with the right wing of the INC. 
The more forceful Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was founded in 
1925 as a well-disciplined national service organization, composed 
of men who had dedicated their lives to working full-time for the 
advancement of India as a Hindu nation. 

A History of India
250
The Muslim League


Most significantly, the Muslim League, under the sole command of 
Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was able to advance its own agenda during 
World War II. The British government needed their support and was 
willing to make concessions in order to obtain it.


The abstract idea of a Muslim nation had been developing for decades, 
but it was not until 1940 that the Muslim League resolved to create a 
separate dominion for Muslims. They did so with British support. 


In his presidential address to the Muslim League that year, Jinnah 
shifted his rhetoric radically to characterize Muslims as a separate 
“nation” from Hindus. Through astute appeals to Muslim voters that 
Islam was in danger, Jinnah proved able to mobilize them as never 
before. He eventually convinced most Muslim voters that they would 
betray their religion if they voted for any candidate not committed to 
the new nation, Pakistan, and the Muslim League party. 


Meanwhile, British efforts to hold India during the war and after 
faltered. In June 1945, the British sought to retain control by 
balancing equal numbers of Hindu and Muslim members in an 
Indian executive council to head an interim government. But Jinnah 
demanded that he alone select all the Muslims appointed. This meant 
that any Muslim leader who supported the INC would be excluded.
Jinnah’s Challenge


Jinnah could not afford to be very precise about what the nation of 
Pakistan would be, or even where it would be located. He needed 
the votes of as many Muslims as possible, so he deliberately used 
only an abstract concept of Pakistan.


In his negotiations with the British and with rival INC and other 
political leaders, however, Jinnah had to be more specific. His most 
comprehensive demand was that all of the provinces that had 
Muslim majorities had to go entirely to Pakistan. 

Lecture 30—The Partition of 1947 
251


In particular, this meant all of the large provinces of Punjab and 
Bengal. But large minorities in those provinces were Hindu or Sikh. 
Jinnah therefore had to convince his negotiating opponents that, 
despite his fiery rhetoric, the substantial non-Muslim populations in 
these provinces would be fully protected citizens. 


Countering Jinnah, the INC and the British argued that only 
districts—that is, counties—with a Muslim majority and also that 
were contiguous in the western and eastern regions would go to 
Pakistan. That meant the partitioning of the major provinces of 
Punjab and Bengal, since there were Muslim majorities in only about 
half those regions. Jinnah dismissed this as a “moth-eaten” Pakistan, 
but that is what finally came to pass.
Moving toward Independence


As the Allied war against Germany and Japan ended in a costly 
victory in 1945, the end of British colonial rule over India became ever 
more evident. The powerful promise by Franklin Roosevelt, echoed 
by Harry Truman, that the war was for national self-determination 
put pressure on the British government to withdraw from India. 
Britain had been exhausted of blood and treasure, making imperial 
rule in India impossible to sustain. 


The divide among Indian voters between the Indian National 
Congress and the Muslim League also hardened. In the elections 
of 1945–46, the INC won 90 percent of open seats for the center 
government and also established INC ministries in 8 of the 11 
provinces of British India. 


For its part, the Muslim League won all the seats reserved for 
Muslims in the central legislature and 80 percent of those reserved for 
Muslims in the provincial legislatures. Overall, it secured 75 percent 
of all Muslim votes.

A History of India
252


The nature and extent of the new nations that were about to be 
born remained disputed. Early in 1946, the British Cabinet sent 
a mission with a plan for three loosely federated collections of 
provinces based on their religious majority, with only a very weak 
central government. The hundreds of Indian princes would be 
free to join their states to either India or Pakistan, or to remain 
independent. 


At first, Nehru seemed to 
accept this plan, although 
it gave all of Punjab and 
Bengal to the western and 
the 
eastern 
collections, 
respectively. While Jinnah 
disliked 
many 
aspects 
of this plan, it did meet 
his demand that Muslim 
majority 
provinces 
not 
be divided. But then, in a 
July 1946 speech, Nehru 
asserted that everything 
could 
be 
reorganized 
once the British left. This 
enabled Jinnah to claim 
betrayal and repudiate the 
plan, too. 


As negotiations for independence proceeded, Jinnah drove hard 
bargains. To prove his popular support, in August 1946, he declared 
a “Day of Direct Action.” While he did not explicitly call for violence, 
it broke out in several areas. Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh mobs, 
including many demobilized but battle-hardened soldiers, clashed. 
More than 10,000 people were killed over the following week, with 
many more wounded and burned out of their homes.


Also in 1946, scattered groups of Indian seamen and soldiers rejected 
the authority of their British commanders. The British lost the trust 
they had held in the loyalty of the Indian armed forces. 
The Situation Escalates


In February 1947, the British appointed Lord Louis Mountbatten 
as the last viceroy to oversee the transfer of power. Mountbatten 
immediately moved the projected date of independence ahead by 
nearly a year, to 
August 1947. This 
meant 
that 
the 
official preparations 
had to be greatly 
rushed. 


The 
government, 
army, and the entire 
a d m i n i s t r a t i o n 
including 
the 
treasury 
had 
to 
be divided in a 
hurry. 
Further, 
M o u n t b a t t e n 
pressed Jinnah and 
Nehru 
to 
accept 
that two new independent nations would be partitioned out of 
colonial India, with the Punjab and Bengal divided along religious 
lines.


Since the official commission on boundaries contained both Muslim 
League and Congress members, who could not agree, its chairman, 
Sir Cyril Radcliffe, made the impossible decisions about where the 
boundaries would be.


The commission did not even announce its allocations until days after 
Pakistan and India were already independent nations. Desperate 
fighting had already been going on for months. The result was what 
would today be called ethnic cleansing, leaving the western wing of 
Pakistan 97 percent Muslim, with about 5 million Hindus and Sikhs 
driven out.
Fallout


The madness and trauma of the partition remains almost 
inconceivable even today, especially for many of the survivors. 
For instance, a man who made himself among the world’s greatest 
short story writers, Saadat Hasan Manto, struggled to convey to 
his contemporaries the all-too-real, inexplicable experiences of the 
partition, using the unreality of fiction. 


Perhaps his most famous short story, and one that is particularly 
relevant here, is entitled “Toba Tek Singh.” The central figure 
is a Sikh landholder who has long been locked up in a lunatic 
asylum located in what has now become Pakistan. As the 
emotions around the partition rise and peak, the inmates 
each try to comprehend what suddenly being an Indian or a 
Pakistani means. 


They begin to divide into increasingly hostile factions, based 
on what they confusingly remember about their past lives. 
Eventually, the new governments of India and Pakistan decide 
to relocate the inmates based on their officially recorded religion 
and also the location of their family homes. But the inmates 
themselves often have no clue as to which side of the newly 
created border their homes now lie. 


Since Hindus and Sikhs are to be expelled from Pakistan, the 
inmate known as Toba Tek Singh is finally driven out from 
Pakistan. But he refuses to enter India. The story ends with 
him collapsing, either catatonic or dead, in the no-man’s-land 
between.

The general number of the partition’s refugees and deaths is 
disputed, but the most likely figures are 10–12 million refugees and 
1–2 million deaths. In any case, this was one of the largest tragedies 
and forced migrations in human history.

Lecture 31
West and East Pakistan
A
s Pakistan emerged out of the heated negotiations and fiery 
events of the 1947 partition, its citizens and competing political 
leaders had to determine the nature of their new nation. Many 
diverse people and groups have continued to clash during the subsequent 
seven tumultuous decades of Pakistan’s history down to the present. In 
order to discuss and illustrate these complex issues, we’ll look selectively 
at chronological events and developments affecting Pakistan. In this 
lecture, we’ll consider events up until Pakistan divided in 1971, with its 
western and eastern wings each becoming an independent nation. 
Tensions


Almost immediately upon independence in 1947, tensions arose 
between Pakistan’s western and eastern wings. These wings were 
culturally very different and located 1,000 miles apart across Indian 
territory. 


East Bengal comprised more than half of Pakistan’s population, but 
almost all of the new nation’s most prominent political and military 
leaders were based in the western wing. Their vision of the new 
nation only imperfectly included the Bengali eastern wing. After all, 
there is no B for Bengal in the name Pakistan, which is an acronym 
for Punjab, Afghania, Kashmir, Sindh, and Baluchistan, all located in 
the western wing. 


Pakistan’s leader at the time, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, made his only 
visit to the country’s eastern wing in March 1948. In a speech in 
English that alienated many people there, Jinnah directed them to 
use Urdu in place of their own language, Bengali. This was for many 
Bengalis an ominous warning that West Pakistani leaders considered 

Lecture 31—West and East Pakistan 
257
them culturally inferior, and even considered them not good 
Muslims. Yet, being Muslim was the primary reason that Bengalis 
were part of Pakistan in the first place. 


Although the Punjab region had been divided between India and 
Pakistan at the partition, the Pakistani part of the Punjab by itself 
held about two-thirds of West Pakistan’s population. One of the 
recurring tensions in West Pakistan has always between Punjabis 
and all the other ethnic identities. 


Pakistan’s second largest province by population is Sindh. This was 
the first part of South Asia that came under the rule of Muslims. But, 
over the 13 centuries since then, an amalgamated Indian and Muslim 
culture developed. 


While the port of Karachi is located on the Sindh coast, it remains 
culturally, politically, and economically somewhat apart from the rest 
of that province. Karachi was Pakistan’s first national capital. After 
independence, Karachi began to expand into Pakistan’s industrial 

A History of India
258
center. Its current population is more than 17 million people, but 
only a small minority of Karachi’s inhabitants is ethnically Sindhi. 
Muhajirs


Since independence, Karachi’s politics and economy have been 
dominated by the self-styled Muhajir community. These are people 
whose families left north India and migrated to Pakistan at the time 
of partition. Many of them were refugees, driven out of their homes 
because they were Muslims. Others migrated to Pakistan out of a 
commitment to Islam or to the idea of a Muslim nation. 


In 1947, Muhajirs tended to be better educated and sometimes had 
more capital and experience with entrepreneurship than did Sindhis 
and other West Pakistanis. They often gained possession of the 
houses and businesses left behind in Karachi and some other cities in 
Sindh when Hindus left for India in 1947. 


Their community’s language is Urdu, which became the official 
language of Pakistan, although few outside the Muhajir community 
had that language as their mother tongue. Many of Pakistan’s early 
leaders, including several military dictators and influential national 
religious leaders, have been Muhajirs. 


For many Sindhis and other ethnic groups in Pakistan, there is 
sometimes a sense that Muhajirs acted like carpetbaggers. They 
had been accepted as refugees, but they took over the entire nation. 
Plus, many Muhajirs are Shiites, which is the minority sect in Islam 
and in Pakistan. Many of their mosques and their people have been 
attacked by militant Sunnis as a result.
Baluchistan


Baluchistan is the Pakistani region that is geographically largest 
and most richly endowed with some strategic natural resources, 
especially natural gas and uranium. But the Baluch people are among 

Lecture 31—West and East Pakistan 
259
the poorest and most marginalized in Pakistan. They have received 
few economic benefits from those natural resources extracted for use 
in Sindh and the Punjab. 


The Baluch comprise only about 3 percent of the population of West 
Pakistan. Since many Baluch people live in Iran or in Afghanistan, 
their nationalism cuts across what are today national boundaries. 
Baluch guerrilla movements have thus been fighting, with varying 
degrees of intensity and violence, against the Pakistani, Iranian, and 
Afghan governments for seven decades.
The Pakhtun People


Many Pashto-speaking Pakhtun people are also disputing the 
national boundaries that divide their ethnic community. In Pakistan, 
the province that the British called the northwest frontier has recently 
been renamed Khyber Pakhtunwa—that is, the land of the Pakhtun 
people in the Khyber River region. 


From colonial times onward, a strategic part of this province has 
stood largely outside of government control. This is FATA, the 
Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where the Pakistani legal code 
does not apply. Sharia law is in force. 


Various Islamist groups are based there, most notably the Taliban of 
Pakistan. Additionally, the rival Taliban of Afghanistan, al-Qaeda, 
and the Islamic State all have considerable support there. The 
Pakistani army has struggled to assert control. 
Pakistan’s Government


Because Jinnah wanted to be a strong Governor-General, he 
established a presidential system of government, since the head 
of the executive branch holds the most political power. But that 
presidential model has only intermittently prevailed in Pakistan.

A History of India
260


Instead, following Jinnah’s death just a year after independence, the 
head of the legislative branch, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, took 
over. This shift came even before the constitution of Pakistan had 
been written, so there were no actual legal changes. 


Liaquat Ali Khan directed the Constitutional Assembly of Pakistan 
to write a constitution that recognized Allah as Pakistan’s sovereign. 
Non-Muslim minorities were to be protected, but “the State will 
create such conditions as are conducive to the building up of a truly 
Islamic society.” 


Liaquat Ali Khan also did not live to implement his vision for Pakistan. 
He was assassinated in 1951, just three years after Jinnah’s death. 


Eventually taking over the government in this dangerous time 
of instability was a businessman and civil servant, Ghulam 
Muhammad. He used the office of governor-general to seize power 
in order to quell escalating social violence.


Just four years later, an ill Ghulam Muhammad was forced out by a 
retired general, Iskander Mirza, who took over the office and powers 
of governor-general. As governor-general, he instituted Pakistan’s 
first constitution and was unanimously elected president by the new 
parliament. But his regime was unstable. 


In 1958, he had to turn to the army to quell widespread disorder, 
declaring martial law, abrogating the young constitution, and 
dismissing parliament. But within weeks, the man whom he’d 
appointed chief martial law administrator and the head of the 
army, General Ayub Khan, forced Iskander Mirza to go into exile 
in London. This was the first of four successful military coups in 
Pakistan’s short history.

Lecture 31—West and East Pakistan 
261
Military Rule


Ayub Khan was a career 
army officer until his coup. 
During his 11-year rule, 
secularism and economic 
development, rather than 
Islam, guided his policies 
and the new constitution 
he imposed in 1962. 


He shifted the national 
capital 
from 
Karachi 
to 
a 
new 
planned 
city, Islamabad, in the 
shadow of the army’s 
national 
headquarters 
in Rawalpindi. He also 
moved Pakistan into a 
military alliance with the 
U.S., providing a base 
for American U-2 spy 
planes flying over the 
Soviet Union. 


The U.S.-equipped Pakistani army fought its second war against 
Soviet-equipped India in 1965. In addition to Kashmir, there was a 
disputed border in the far south, in the Rann of Kutch. This land was 
sometimes underwater, but during the dry part of the year it was a 
salt flat, ideal for rapid tank combat. 


Despite a month of bitter fighting and a few thousand casualties, 
neither army gained much ground. But both India and Pakistan 
lost much foreign aid. Finally, the Soviet government called the 
belligerents to Tashkent for peace negotiations. 
General Ayub Khan

A History of India
262


Ayub Khan’s government was weakened by the failure of the 
Pakistani army to achieve its much-promised victory over India. 
Economic disparities increased within both West and East Pakistan, 
and also between these two wings. Popular and political unrest rose 
against his regime.


This led in 1969 to yet another army-forced transfer of power, 
as General Yahya Khan took over first as chief martial law 
administrator, and then as Pakistan’s president. He suspended the 
young constitution, dissolved Pakistan’s parliament, and replaced 
civilians with military administrators. 


International and domestic criticism of military rule led Yahya Khan 
to bring at least one civilian into his government. He chose the 
energetic Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who had served in several previous 
military-dominated cabinets since 1958.
The Pakistan People’s Party


In 1967, Bhutto created the Pakistan People’s Party in order to 
broaden his political base. This party reached out to the masses across 
Pakistan, although its core support was 
in Sindh province. Ideologically, Bhutto 
combined an appeal to Islam with 
promises of socialism. 


Influenced by Bhutto, General Yahya 
Khan declared a national election late 
in 1970 to elect a new constitutional 
convention that would be succeeded 
by a national assembly. This was really 
the first popular democratic election in 
Pakistan’s history, coming more than 
two decades after independence.
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman

Lecture 31—West and East Pakistan 
263


Led by the charismatic Bhutto, the Pakistan People’s Party won a 
strong majority of all the seats in West Pakistan, but won none of 
the seats in the eastern wing of the nation. In East Pakistan, another 
dynamic political leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, led the Awami 
League party to a resounding victory. Yahya Khan and other West 
Pakistani politicians regarded the Awami League as secessionist or 
even treasonous.
Military Events


Rather than recognize this shift of political power from West to East 
Pakistan, Yahya Khan suspended the start of the newly elected body. 
He also sent in a large part of the Pakistan Army to, as he saw it, 
restore order in the east. 


In Operation Searchlight, the army and its local militant supporters 
used force to arrest or even kill political and cultural leaders. The 
violence escalated, and there were mass executions. About 10 million 
East Pakistanis fled as refugees into India. Many of the young male 
refugees were organized and equipped by the Indian army into the 
Mukti Bahini, or freedom force, that waged guerilla war against the 
Pakistan Army.


As international pressure intensified on Pakistan to halt this 
repression and recognize the outcome of the election, Zulfikar Ali 
Bhutto defended the Pakistani government heatedly. He spoke 
forcefully at the United Nations against these international designs 
to intervene in the affairs of the sovereign state of Pakistan. When 
he failed to persuade the international community, Bhutto threw his 
papers into the air and dramatically strode out of the UN General 
Assembly.


After a brief war, the third between Pakistan and India, the Indian 
Army captured the entire Pakistani army posted in the east, almost 
100,000 soldiers. This partitioned the two wings of Pakistan into 
separate nations. 

A History of India
264


As both the electoral victor in the west, which was now all that was 
left of Pakistan, and as its most popular and fervent defender, Bhutto 
set aside Yahya Khan and took over first as a civilian chief martial 
law administrator and then as president. This ended the long period, 
from 1955 until 1971, that the Pakistan military controlled Pakistan’s 
government.

Lecture 32
The New Pakistan
I
n 1971, Pakistan was transformed when its eastern wing, which 
held more than half its population, broke away. Many of the same 
issues that had long convulsed West Pakistan continued after the 
split. Ethnic groups vying for political advantage, the debate over 
secular versus Islamic society, gaps between the rich and poor, and gaps 
between men and women are just a few of the factors that have led to 
social tensions in Pakistan. The nature of government and international 
affairs have also played a role. We’ve seen how each of these many issues 
affected Pakistan’s development over its first quarter century, from 
1947 until 1971. In this lecture, we’ll continue our selective narrative of 
Pakistan up to the present.
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto


Zulfikar Ali Bhutto stood forth after the 1971 civil war ended with 
the eastern wing’s secession and the Pakistani Army’s humiliating 
defeat. Military dictator Yahya Khan was forced to resign. Bhutto then 
took office as the first civilian chief martial law administrator and 
commander-in-chief of the army. He then imposed a new constitution 
in 1973, with himself as the greatly empowered prime minister. 


The liberation of the eastern wing of Pakistan by Bengali nationalists 
encouraged diverse Baluch, Sindhi, Pakhtun, and Muhajir nationalists 
in the western wing to demand their own independence. Under 
Bhutto and various of his successors, the Pakistan Army has used 
great force to suppress movements seeking to further divide Pakistan.


Bhutto created the Federal Security Force, which was more heavily 
armed than the police. This gave Bhutto a paramilitary loyal to him 
and further reduced his dependence on the army.

A History of India
266


Although Bhutto retained his family’s huge landed estates in Sindh, 
he reached out to the working classes across the nation. One of his 
first major programs was to nationalize many large industries, banks, 
cotton- and grain-processing mills, utilities, schools, and hospitals, 
implementing his promises about socialism. Like other progressive 
Muslim leaders around the world, he called this Islamic socialism. 


His electoral rhetoric encouraged trade unions, which had never 
been strong in Pakistan before. But these unions began to make 
demands, reinforced with strikes, for more pay and other benefits. 
Bhutto’s government clamped down on them.


Internationally, Bhutto also enhanced his own and Pakistan’s role 
through a strengthened alliance with Mao’s China. This gave him 
leverage against the Soviet Union, the U.S., and India. 


Bhutto initiated two competing nuclear arms programs. One 
concentrated on a uranium nuclear bomb, the other on a plutonium 
one. One of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programs succeeded, 
making Pakistan both an atomic power and also the source of nuclear 
weapons proliferation in Iran, Libya, and North Korea.
General Zia ul-Haq


To prove his authority to Pakistan and the world, Bhutto ordered 
a national election in 1977. The PPP won decisively, but many 
political adversaries accused Bhutto and the PPP of widespread 
election irregularities, including the assassination of some opposing 
candidates.


Based on those accusations, in 1977 the head of the Pakistan Army, 
General Zia ul-Haq, led a coup, ejecting Bhutto from office and 
imprisoning him. Bhutto was tried for murder and other crimes. 
He was executed by hanging in 1979. Following his coup, General 
Zia took over first as chief martial law administrator then later as 
president, ruling from 1978 until 1988.	

Lecture 32—The New Pakistan 
267


In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded neighboring Afghanistan. There 
had been a communist government in Afghanistan that was pro-
Russia, but a different communist faction displaced it. 


Mobilizing resistance to the Soviet army, General Zia with U.S. 
support recruited a collection of fighters known as the mujahidin 
(“those who wage jihad”). Many of these mujahidin were Pakhtun 
Afghans who had fled the Soviets for refugee camps in Pakistan. 


Without the cooperation of General Zia’s administration, the 
U.S. could not supply arms and funding to these mujahidin, so 
President Ronald Regan decided to work with General Zia’s military 
regime rather than oppose it. This arming of the mujahidin drove 
the Russians out in 1989. But then the U.S. abruptly withdrew its 
involvement in Afghanistan, leaving Pakistan feeling abandoned and 
alone in having to deal with the aftermath of that war.
Islam in Pakistan


General Zia instituted policies that would make Pakistan more 
Islamic. This both reflected his personal faith and also gained him 
the support of Islamist leaders and parties. 


Most prominent among the Islamist leaders was Maulana Maududi. 
Like General Zia, he had emigrated from India to Pakistan. Once 
there, he had organized a movement, the Jama’at-i Islami (“Islamist 
Party”), which sought to create the perfect Islamic society.


Under General Zia’s rule, the Jama’at-i Islami and its policies 
gained ground. General Zia instituted the Federal Shariat Court. 
The religiously trained members of this court had the power to 
overrule any of Pakistan’s laws that did not accord with the Sharia, 
the Islamic law based on the Quran and the words and deeds of the 
Prophet Muhammad. 

A History of India
268


Another controversial legal change under General Zia’s rule were 
the Hudood Ordinances of 1979. Those set out punishments as 
stipulated in the Quran, including whipping for criminals. In 
theory, married adulterers could also be stoned to death and thieves 
could have a hand amputated, but these are not the actual practice 
in Pakistan. 


These Hudood laws also defined who has legal standing. The 
testimony of non-Muslims and even of Muslim women in law 
courts is worth less than a Muslim man’s. Contracts and other legal 
documents signed by women and non-Musllims carry less weight 
as well. 


When the legislature began to differ from General Zia, he 
dissolved it in 1988. Some senior military officers were convicted 
of treason. Some journalists and outspoken political opponents 
were imprisoned. The ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) branch of the 
military expanded its power.
Benazir Bhutto


The most prominent opponent of General Zia was Benazir Bhutto. 
The eldest child of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, she had been her father’s 
closest supporter during his imprisonment. Her two younger 
brothers died under highly suspect circumstances. 


Benazir Bhutto herself suffered rigorous and physically debilitating 
imprisonment for years, until General Zia allowed her to leave 
Pakistan for medical treatment in 1984. From exile, she led the loosely 
allied umbrella group of opposition parties, called the Movement for 
the Restoration of Democracy. She also headed the Pakistan People’s 
Party (PPP) that her late father had started.


Bravely, Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan in 1986, defying General 
Zia’s regime. Wherever she went, crowds thronged, seeing her as the 
defiant hope for democracy. Improving her status for conservatives, 

Lecture 32—The New Pakistan 
269
in 1987 Benazir Bhutto married. She agreed to marry Asif Ali Zardari 
with the understanding that she would retain her name and political 
career while at the same time having a family life with him. 


In 1988, General Zia’s military plane crashed. Aboard were the 
American ambassador and many top Pakistani generals. The cause 
of the crash has never been officially determined. 


In the election that followed, Benazir Bhutto’s PPP won enough seats 
to make her prime minister. She took office in 1988. But neither the 
PPP nor the competing branches of government fully supported 
her. Accusations of ineffectiveness and corruption mounted against 
her and her husband. Then, after just two years, the president of 
Pakistan, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, evoked the 8th amendment to the 
constitution and dismissed her from office. 
Benazir Bhutto

A History of India
270


In the election that followed in 1990, the Bhutto family’s major 
opponent, Nawaz Sharif, led the Punjab-based Pakistan Muslim 
League to victory, forming a conservative coalition government. 


Many of Benazir Bhutto’s programs were reversed and some of those 
of General Zia reinstated. But again, accusations of incompetence 
and corruption grew against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. After less 
than three years, the president of Pakistan evoked the 8th amendment 
and, with army backing, forced Sharif from office. 


In the election that followed, voters turned back to Benazir Bhutto, 
making her prime minister once more. She barely survived an 
abortive military coup. Again her administration failed to overcome 
the many obstacles it and she faced. Pakistan’s economy faltered, 
and accusations of corruption flourished. 


After only three years, the president of Pakistan, then Farooq 
Leghari, evoked the 8th amendment to the constitution and dismissed 
her from office again. 


In the 1997 election that followed, Nawaz Sharif returned to office 
with a substantial victory. Newspapers reported that his followers 
physically intimidated the Supreme Court. Benazir Bhutto fled with 
her children into exile, while her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, was 
imprisoned for eight years on corruption charges. Nawaz Sharif also 
used his large majority in the legislature to amend the constitution 
before it could be used against him again.
Tensions


When India conducted a series of underground nuclear weapons 
tests in May 1998, Pakistan was ready to respond. Nawaz Sharif 
ordered Pakistan to test as many atomic weapons as India had just 
fired, plus one more.

Lecture 32—The New Pakistan 
271


Tensions between Pakistan and India broke out in spring of 1999 
when a Pakistani force dug itself into positions along a mountain 
ridge at Kargil in Kashmir. This war remained undeclared, making it 
the third-and-a-half war between Pakistan and India. As the Indian 
forces fought their way up the steep mountainside, the Pakistani 
forces withdrew.
Pervez Musharraf


The 
head 
of 
the 
Pakistan Army, General 
Pervez 
Musharraf, 
blamed Nawaz Sharif 
for the failed attempt 
at Kargil and then the 
humiliating 
retreat. 
Nawaz Sharif in turn 
dismissed 
General 
Musharraf, 
choosing 
a 
time 
when 
the 
general 
was 
flying 
back and denying his 
plane landing rights 
anywhere in Pakistan. 
The general ordered 
his plane to land anyway and organized a counter-coup to seize the 
airport and then the government.


The army, which was very experienced in taking over the government, 
arrested Nawaz Sharif and put him on trial for airline hijacking, 
kidnapping, terrorism, and attempted murder, since he had ordered 
the general’s plane not to land even though it was running out of 
fuel. General Musharraf allowed Nawaz Sharif to go into exile rather 
than be imprisoned if he promised to stay out of politics.
Pervez Musharraf

A History of India
272


In 1999, once again Pakistan had a military government. Pervez 
Musharraf appointed himself the chief executive and then the 
president, and he also retained authority as commander of the army 
for eight more years. 


General Musharaff sought popular and international legitimacy for 
his regime. He created a loyalist political party, the Pakistan Muslim 
League (Q). The Q is for Quaid-i-Azam, the honorary title for M. 
A. Jinnah. In the disputed 2002 elections, his party led a coalition 
government under his presidency.


The September 11, 2001 al-Qaeda attacks against America led to 
the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force invasion of 
Afghanistan in 2001 to depose the Taliban government. General 
Musharraf came out in support of the U.S., allowing masses of 
supplies to enter Karachi port and be trucked into Afghanistan.


But widespread popular and judicial opposition to continued 
military rule began to mount. In 2007, General Musharraf suspended 
the constitution and declared a state of emergency. 


To lead the opposition, Benazir Bhutto again returned to Pakistan at 
great personal risk. She again stood up as the voice of democracy. 
But this time, repeated assassination attempts finally lead to her 
death in December 2007. 


This increased the pressure on Pervez Musharraf until he resigned 
the next year in the face of impeachment, leading to the election of 
a new president. In the wave of sympathy for Benazir Bhutto, her 
widowed husband, Asif Ali Zardari, won that election. 


Tensions among the various branches of government persisted. 
Zardari proved a relatively weak president, although he remained 
in office throughout his elected term. When the election of 2013 was 
held and his term ended, Zardari peacefully transferred power to the

Lecture 33
Independent Bangladesh
B
angladesh is roughly the size of Iowa, yet contains the world’s 
eighth largest population—that is, about half of the entire 
population of the U.S. In addition to extreme population density, 
Bangladesh faces high poverty rates and an inefficient and corrupt 
government. Further, there are new challenges, like rising sea levels 
caused by climate change, which will flood its highly productive 
southern coast. Still, the men and women of Bangladesh have always 
proven themselves to be resilient and enterprising. They endured three 
disrupting partitions, in 1905, 1947, and 1971. Each entailed major 
political, social, and cultural instabilities. Even today, Bangladesh is 
racked by questions about the essence of the nation.
The First Two Partitions


In 1905, the British Raj divided the majority Muslim East Bengal from 
the predominantly Hindu West Bengal. This was the first of Bengal’s 
three partitions during the 20th century. Most scholars agree that this 
was a British political effort to weaken the Indian nationalist leaders 
based in Calcutta. Many of these were Hindu landlords with landed 
estates in the east. The 1905 partition put those estates in a different 
province. 


Widespread popular protests convinced the British Raj that this 
partition was a major blunder. Just seven years later, the British Raj 
pushed East and West Bengal back together again. 


The British Raj next tried in a different way to weaken the Calcutta-
based Indian nationalists by shifting the imperial capital of India to 
the newly built planned city of New Delhi. While Bengali politicians 
continued to be active in the nationalist movement, many of the new 

Lecture 33—Independent Bangladesh 
275
leaders came from other regions. Examples were the Nehru family, 
based in north India, and Mohandas Gandhi and Muhammad Ali 
Jinnah, based on the west coast. 


In August 1947, as the British left India, they partitioned Bengal once 
again. This time, Muslim nationalists led by Jinnah and the Muslim 
League demanded the partition. These Muslim politicians had 
wanted all of Bengal to be included in their new country of Pakistan, 
but they only got the eastern half of Bengal. 


About 1–2 million Hindu Bengalis, including many of the landlords 
and other social, educational, and economic leaders, fled to India. 
Many millions of Muslims moved east, and millions of Hindus 
remained. Today, about 12 percent of the population in Bangladesh

is Hindu. In contrast, almost all non-Muslims fled or were killed in 
Pakistan’s western wing, leaving Hindus as only 3 percent of the 
population. 


The 1947 partition also cut across Bengal’s economy. One of the 
most valuable crops of East Bengal, jute, had been processed in 
factories in Calcutta into ropes and hemp cloth, still used widely in 
shipping bags. Now, the two complementary parts of this economy 
were severed. The east still exports jute and rice, but mostly as raw 
materials, with low profit margins. Recently, Bangladesh has made 
itself a major exporter of ready-made garments.
West and East Pakistan


During the quarter century that East Pakistan was joined to West 
Pakistan, many Muslim Bengalis felt impoverished, alienated, and 
demeaned. The economic arrangements between West and East 
Pakistan greatly benefited the western wing. 


The vast expenditures on the Pakistan Army and the costly 1965 war 
against India both seemed ill-advised to many East Pakistanis. Since 
Bengalis lived both in the West Bengal state within India and also in 
East Bengal within Pakistan, this made India appear less threatening 
to many East Pakistanis.


Almost all of the political, economic, and cultural leadership of 
Pakistan favored that nation’s western wing. Very few Bengali 
politicians rose up prominently in Pakistani governments. 
Self-Determination


From the creation of West and East Pakistan in 1947, many East 
Pakistanis felt themselves to be an “internal colony,” with only 
frustrated hopes for independent national self-determination. In 
response, during in the early 1950s, many Bengalis rose up around 
their proud cultural heritage through a highly politicized Bengali

277
language movement. But its peaceful street protests met with heavy-
handed police repression. The language movement continued even 
after 1954, when Bengali was officially made an additional national 
language for Pakistan.


In what proved to be a miscalculation, in 1969, the latest West 
Pakistani military dictator, General Yahya Khan, ordered the election 
of a new assembly in the following year. This election opened up the 
possibility for a new kind of Pakistan. Support rose in East Pakistan 
for the politician Mujibur Rahman and his Awami League, which 
had pro-Bengali aspirations. 


Coincidentally, a month before the election, a terrible storm left 
hundreds of thousands of Bengalis dead and millions more displaced. 
The situation was made much worse since the Pakistani government 
had not provided adequate advance warning and accomplished little 
in the way of rehabilitation. 


Consequently, in the 1970 election, Mujibur Rahman’s Awami League 
swept the polls in the east with 99 percent of the vote, winning 
almost all the seats available there. This gave the Awami League the 
absolute majority of the seats in the assembly. 


But the Awami League won no seats in West Pakistan, where Zulfikar 
Ali Bhutto’s Pakistan People’s Party gained a majority. Instead 
of accepting the results of the election he had authorized, General 
Yahya Khan suspended the assembly. 


After heated negotiations between Mujibur Rahman and Bhutto 
broke down, the Pakistan Army went in to crush the East Pakistani 
leadership and populace in Operation Searchlight. Millions of 
Bengali refugees fled to safety in neighboring India. Many of the 
refugee men were armed by India and allowed to return to the 
fighting as the Mukti Bahini, or Freedom Force guerrillas. 

A History of India
278


Pro-Pakistani Islamists, including many Bihari immigrants, allied 
with the Pakistan Army. Many organized into the militant Razakars, 
a militia that stood accused of some of the worst atrocities. For 
example, the main university was surrounded and students 
executed. Labor leaders and other activists were also killed. Many 
women were sexually assaulted to break the spirit of Bengalis. 


All this fighting entailed mass killing. Pakistani authorities have 
reluctantly admitted about 300,000 killed, but many Bengalis claim 
10 times as many died. 


Finally, the Indian Army invaded in support of the Mukti Bahini. 
Allied Indian and Bengali forces swiftly captured the entire Pakistan 
Army in the east, about 100,000 men. Then the Indian Army 
withdrew, leaving Bangladesh independent.
New Identity


A predominant majority of Bangladesh’s people are Muslims. 
This includes most but not all Bengalis, plus Biharis. But Islamists 
had been discredited in many people’s eyes for having supported 
Pakistan in 1971. A strongly Muslim identity would exclude millions 
of Bengali Hindus and mostly Christian Adivasis who are legally 
citizens of Bangladesh. 


These factors have continued to compete in the national identity, one 
more inclusively Bengali and more strongly Islamic. The former has led 
to more affinities with India, the other with the larger Muslim world. 


There are also powerful divisions with Bangladesh based on 
economic class. For many leftist citizens of Bangladesh, their new 
nation represented new opportunities for radical restructuring. In his 
rhetoric, Mujibur Rahman had long promised social and economic 
reforms that would lead to the nationalization of industries and the 
expansion of public services, and would prioritize the reduction of 
economic inequality

Mujibur Rahman’s in Power


Mujibur 
Rahman 
stood 
forth 
as 
provisional 
president 
at 
independence, but then chose to be elected prime minister. Ever 
since, Bangladesh has wavered between a British-style parliamentary 
democracy and a strong, executive presidential government.


While Mujibur Rahman was considered honest, many people 
regarded his administration as ineffective and corrupt. The 
disordered economy made worse a vast famine in 1973–74, in which 
tens of thousands starved to death. 


Subsequently, Mujibur Rahman declared a state of emergency and 
consolidated power as the strongly executive president. He also 
amended the new constitution to make Bangladesh a one-party state. 
The militia loyal to him used force against his political opponents. 
Coups and Changes


There were deep splits between two factions—the Mukti Bahini 
and career army men—in the new Bangladesh Army officer corps. 
Bangladesh has subsequently suffered from hundreds of attempted 
military coups, although only a few of them were successful.


The first successful coup came in August 1975. A band of army 
officers assassinated Mujibur Rahman and most of his family. A 
daughter, Begum Sheikh Hasina, happened to be away from home 
at the time. She inherited the leadership of the Awami League and 
some of the prestige of her martyred father. 


Begum Hasina so far has been elected prime minister on three 
separate occasions. Her party tends to stress the Bengali component 
of the national identity, and her policies have tended to be favorable 
toward India.


This 1975 coup against Mujibur Rahman was followed by a period of 
disruption and instability in the government. This only ended in 1977 

A History of India
280
when General Ziaur Rahman, a career officer, consolidated power. 
His model for Bangladesh moved away from Mujibur Rahman’s 
secular socialism in favor of more free-market development and 
toward Islam. He also organized a political party, the Bangladesh 
Nationalist Party (BNP), to institutionalize his support. 


But he was assassinated in 1981 in an attempted coup by rival 
military officers. His BNP party and cause were inherited by his 
widow, Begum Khaleda Zia. So far, she has been elected twice as 
Bangladesh’s prime minister, and she is still the leading opposition 
figure. Her party tends to stress the Islamic component of the 
national identity, often allying with explicitly Islamist parties, and 
her policies have tended to be less favorable toward India. 


General Hussain Muhammad Ershad led yet another army coup in 
1982. He became chief martial law administrator and then president. 
In order to organize support, General Ershad created a new political 
party, the Jatiya Party. This party won controversial elections in 1986 
and 1987 but has remained a relatively minor player in the larger 
battles between the Awami League of Begum Hasina and the BNP of 
Begum Khaleda Zia.


General Ershad, under pressure from the opposition, was forced to 
resign in 1990. In the elections of 1991 that followed General Ershad’s 
resignation, Begum Khaleda Zia’s coalition won enough seats to 
make her prime minister. But street protests by the opposition forced 
her to have a neutral caretaker government run the 1996 election. 


Next, Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League and its allies won enough seats 
to elect her prime minister. But once again, growing street protests 
led to a neutral caretaker government running the 2001 election. 


This was won by Begum Khaleda Zia’s BNP, leading a coalition of 
four parties, including the Jama’at-i Islami, an Islamist Bangladeshi 
party. This time, growing street protests were ended by another 
army coup. 

Lecture 33—Independent Bangladesh 
281


The army appointed as its 
advisor a technocrat and 
economist, 
Fakhruddin 
Ahmad. Over two years of 
military rule, this regime 
created a new system of 
identification cards for all 
citizens. This allowed the 
removal of spurious names 
and deceased voters from 
the voter rolls. 


When the elections were 
held late in 2008, Begum 
Hasina’s 
Awami 
League 
alliance won a decisive 
victory, reinstating her as 
prime minister. Her regime 
was 
overwhelmingly 
reelected in 2014, largely 
because the BNP and its 
allies boycotted the election 
hoping in vain to discredit 
it. 


For her part, Prime Minister Begum Hasina has tried to break up 
the Islamist movement within Bangladesh. In 2009, her government 
created a tribunal to investigate the mass deaths of the independence 
movement and put alleged collaborators with Pakistan on trial. 


About a dozen have been found guilty of crimes against humanity 
during the 1971 war, with several executed so far. Many see this 
as overdue delayed justice, others as mortal vindictiveness by the 
current government against its political opponents, the BNP and 
Jama’at-i Islami.

Lecture 34
India under Nehru
T
he Republic of India will soon be the largest nation by population 
in the world, overtaking China. Remarkably, India has since 
its inception been the world’s largest democracy by far, with 
impressively high levels of political participation by its citizens. India has 
also made great strides economically, militarily, and has even launched 
a space program. We should examine how India accomplished these 
dramatic developments, even as it inherited innumerable internal and 
international challenges. We’ll start in this lecture with independent 
India’s birth, and then we’ll selectively discuss events and developments 
up until the death of its first and longest-serving prime minister, 
Jawaharlal Nehru, in 1964. In the next lecture, we’ll continue to consider 
India’s recent history up to the present.
Democracy in India


From the beginning, most of India’s leadership and citizens have 
remained committed to full electoral democracy. Much of the credit 
for India’s remarkably strong commitment to democracy should 
go to Jawaharlal Nehru and his colleagues in the Indian National 
Congress (INC) party. 


While the Congress was by far the largest political party, there have 
always been alternative voices arguing for other models for the 
nation. On the left, India now has three major communist parties, 
with varying degrees of revolutionary fervor. Both within and 
without the Congress, there have also been socialist factions and 
parties. 


On the right, there are various more conservative factions that push 
for a more capitalist, free-enterprise economic system. There are also 

A History of India
284
parties and movements that identify strongly with one or another 
religious community, or with a particular caste. 


Even within the Congress, there were factional and personal 
disagreements about what national model would be best for India. 
For instance, Mohandas Gandhi favored extremely decentralized 
power. In contrast, Nehru and his close supporters envisioned a 
Westminster-style parliament with centralized planning for the key 
parts of the economy. 


However, both Nehru and Gandhi were strongly committed to 
a secular state. In India, secularism means that the government 
supports all religions equally. Controversially, the Indian law system 
still today has different civil codes for Muslims, Christians, and 
Hindus, as well as a secular code. 
The Indian Constitution


Even before independence, 
Nehru 
and 
the 
INC 
party headed the interim 
transitional 
government. 
Among the new nation’s first 
and most vital undertakings 
was 
to 
envision, 
write, 
and 
ratify 
India’s 
constitution. After years of 
much heated debate, the 
drafting 
committee 
and 
constitutional 
assembly 
produced the constitution, which went into effect on January 26, 
1950. This became India’s Republic Day, still celebrated annually. 


Despite the constitutional assembly’s aspiration to represent a new 
beginning, it drew heavily from Western political traditions. The 
opening phrase should be familiar to all Americans: “We the people.” 
Nehru signing India’s constitution

Lecture 34—India under Nehru 
285


This recognizes that Indian sovereignty emerges from the citizens. 
The Indian constitution then promises liberty, equality, and fraternity, 
echoing the French. It also promises social, economic, and political 
justice and equal status and opportunity for all Indian citizens. These 
principles have been goals toward which the new Indian nation has 
been striving, but much remains to be done.


In a pledge to the nation, the constitution guarantees fundamental 
rights to all including free speech and assembly, a free press, 
protection of private property, the right to form labor unions, and the 
abolition of untouchability.


Another guaranteed fundamental right is for equal protection 
and legal status for everyone. But the constitution also allows 
limitations on that equality through compensatory discrimination 
in favor of women, children, and other socially and educationally 
disadvantaged people, termed the backward classes. 


The last category includes Scheduled Castes (formerly known as 
untouchables) and Scheduled Tribes (also known as Adivasis). 
They are called scheduled since their communities are on an 
official list or schedule. This has meant, among other provisions, 
special reservations or quotas for entry into educational and other 
government institutions.
India’s Government


In more practical terms, the constitution created a bicameral 
legislature, but with unequal chambers. The directly elected Lok 
Sabha, or House of the People, holds more legislative power. The 
Rajya Sabha, or upper house, holds only a secondary role, like the 
British House of Lords. It can delay legislation, but can be overridden 
by the Lok Sabha. 


The constitution accords most powers to India’s indirectly elected 
president. But governance is really exercised by the prime minister, 

A History of India
286
who is elected by the parliament. Nehru preferred to be a strong prime 
minister with a figurehead president, so this became customary. 


This means that the legislative leader also runs the executive branch. 
The strong civil service that carries out the actual administration 
serves the prime minister and his chosen cabinet. That civil service 
is supposed to be apolitical, composed of career bureaucrats with 
strong local authority. In practice, however, often politicians 
pressure local officials to obey.


As in most parliamentary systems, the prime minister has no 
guaranteed term and must resign should any of his or her major bills 
fail in parliament. Some of India’s prime ministers have served only 
for days before losing a parliamentary vote. But Nehru and later 
his daughter, Indira Gandhi, remained prime minister for 18 and 15 
years, respectively, never losing a major bill. 


The Indian Constitution also recognizes a separate judiciary, headed 
by an American-style Supreme Court. For the most part, this judiciary 
India’s Parliament House

Lecture 34—India under Nehru 
287
has effectively checked the combined legislative and executive 
branches of government, both at the central and at the state levels. 


As was generally true for the British colonial administration, India 
does not have trial by jury. This makes courtroom judges powerful 
interpreters and implementers of the law, some of which dates to 
British colonial times. 
Voting in India


Unlike most former colonies, India has always had generally 
free elections. In the first national election of 1951–52, 200 million 
Indians voted. Although 88 percent of them were illiterate, voting 
participation was high. 


In part, this resulted from the numerous caste associations, 
which have mobilized voters. Each caste association represents a 
particular community, for example Jats, a jati of farmers, or Dalits 
(Scheduled Castes). 


Since a single caste association may not be large enough to deliver 
electoral victory, politicians often make differential appeals. They 
form alliances with one or more caste associations, or combine those 
with a class or other issue-based appeals. 
India’s Economy


Nehru recruited India’s leading economists into a planning 
commission that set out economic five-year plans. India’s first five-
year plan, covering 1951–56, was devoted to improving agriculture. 
Agricultural production rose by 25 percent, but full food self-
sufficiency was accomplished only after decades of further effort.


Coming out of colonialism into the post–World War II international 
economy, India’s industries were less developed and unable to 

A History of India
288
compete with the U.S., for example. To protect India’s fledgling 
industries, Nehru imposed very high tariffs on imported goods. 


The second five-year plan, covering 1956–1961, shifted the 
government’s resources toward heavy industry. India’s natural 
resources of coal, iron ore, and timber were to be used to build up 
national production. 


The government owned many of India’s largest factories and mines. 
While such socialist policies appeared attractive to many new 
nations, this part of the Nehru’s legacy has not achieved his vision. 
Government-owned steel mills, airlines, and other industries have 
largely proven to be inefficient, costly drains on the government’s 
budget, not only in India but in Russia, Eastern Europe, and other 
nations as well.
Federalism


Given India’s vast population and great regional diversity, 
most political leaders accepted federalism for India, with many 
governmental functions at the state level. Many Indian states are 
bigger in population than most independent countries. For example, 
the three largest current Indian states would rank as the 6th, 12th, and 
13th largest nations in the world today.


A chief minister heads both the state legislature and the state executive 
branch. A governor is appointed by the central government but 
generally remains a figurehead. Only in times of emergency can the 
center suspend the state legislature and proclaim the governor’s rule. 


The Indian constitution accords many powers to the state 
governments, including education and police. This decentralized 
structure has meant that states often have a powerful leader, with 
a well-developed political base, often in the caste associations 
strongest in that state. 

Lecture 34—India under Nehru 
289
Language


From even before independence, there were heated debates at the 
national and state levels about what the official language should 
be. For over a century, the British colonial government had used 
English as their language of rule. Gandhi, Nehru, and many other 
Indian nationalists wanted to replace English with Hindi, written in 
Devanagari—that is, the Sanskrit-based script. 


But the vast majority of the Indian population did not speak 
Hindi. Many objected that enforcing Hindi would disadvantage 
them compared to native Hindi speakers. Therefore, the Indian 
Constitution recognized 14 official Indian languages and called for a 
15-year transition during which English could also be officially used. 


As that 15-year period ended in 1965, there were mass, and often 
violent, protests against Hindi, especially in the Tamil-speaking 
region of the south. As a compromise, English was officially allowed 
associate language status. 


Yet the central universities and many leading private colleges and 
schools continue to use English. This has helped educated Indians 
participate in the global economy, but has also entrenched different 
classes of literacy. 
States


The British Raj had drawn provincial lines on the basis of the 
historical accident of colonial expansion, as well as British 
administrative convenience. But many Indians identified strongly 
with their regional culture. 


In the years after independence, local movements began to demand 
self-governance by culturally defined groups in several key states. For 
example, in Madras state, various languages were each centered in a 
region with the state boundaries. These cultural communities began 
to demand states of their own. From 1956 onward, these demands 

A History of India
290
were successful in reorganizing many British-created provincial 
boundaries to reflect the extent of the dominant regional language. 


Since independence, India has roughly doubled the number of states. 
There are currently 29 states plus seven union territories. The most 
recent new state came into existence in 2014. But regional groups, 
especially in India’s northeast, continue to demand their own new 
separate states, often using guerilla warfare.
International Relations


During his years as India’s most powerful leader, Nehru worked to 
advance India’s position internationally. Nehru made France give 
up its colony of Pondicherry and in 1961 forcibly annexed Goa and 
Portugal’s other small enclaves. 


The Bandung Conference of 1955 was an attempt to end the Cold 
War by advancing an alternative to either the Western Bloc or the 

Lecture 34—India under Nehru 
291
Soviet Bloc. Nehru became a major leader of this movement, along 
with Indonesia’s Sukarno, Yugoslavia’s Tito, and Egypt’s Nasser. 
But their vision did not succeed since the interests of these various 
leaders and nations diverged.


Nehru’s most significant international frustration was India’s alliance 
with China. India and China had border disputes dating back to when 
the British Empire was strong and imperial China weak. The Chinese 
leader Mao wanted these borders redrawn. When China invaded 
Tibet, Nehru gave refuge to many Tibetan refugees, including the 
Dalai Lama in 1959. 


Then, in 1962, China’s People’s Liberation Army invaded the 
disputed border areas of Aksai Chin, located next to Tibet, and 
Assam, on India’s northeast. The ill-prepared Indian army retreated. 


This political and military humiliation weakened an already ailing 
Nehru. He never fully recovered, although he remained in office 
until his death in May 1964. Nonetheless, in many ways Nehru’s 
dominant policies continue to shape India.

f the dominant national political figure for India’s 18 years was 
Jawaharlal Nehru, then the next dominant figures were his daughter, 
Indira Gandhi, and her two sons, Sanjay and Rajiv. Following them 
was Rajiv’s widow, Sonia. Understanding the history of India requires 
understanding this central Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. In this lecture, we’ll 
consider the decades following the Nehru years. The lecture will focus on 
the careers of Indira, Sanjay, Rajiv, and Sonia Gandhi in the context of the 
many changes in India’s condition.
After Nehru


At the time of Nehru’s death in 1964, the Indian National Congress 
party still prevailed at the center and in most states. Reportedly, the 
party bosses, known as the Congress Syndicate, offered the vacant 
leadership position to Indira Gandhi, daughter of Nehru. She was 
the widow of a man named Gandhi, but no relation to Mohandas 
Gandhi. Having no real experience in government, she declined. 


Next, they selected Lal Bahadur Shastri. A socialist, Shastri had a 
long and respected career in the nationalist movement and as a 
supportive member of Nehru’s cabinet. But he had little political 
base of his own.


Just at this time of post-Nehruvian political transition in India’s 
central government, the second war with Pakistan erupted in 1965. 
A month of fighting left a few thousand soldiers dead but did not 
result in territorial gains for either belligerent. However, just after 
the signing of the peace treaty under Russia’s mediation in Tashkent, 
Prime Minister Shastri died of a sudden heart attack. 

Lecture 35—Modernizing India 
293


This time, the party bosses 
again selected Indira Gandhi 
as 
prime 
minister. 
Once 
in 
office, 
Indira 
Gandhi 
increasingly devised her own 
policies. She pushed hard for 
new kinds of agriculture, 
with 
hybrid 
crops 
and 
intensive 
irrigation 
and 
fertilization. 
The Split


Indira 
Gandhi 
increasingly 
resisted control by the Congress 
Syndicate 
powerbrokers. 
Instead, she aligned more 
with left-wing and regional 
parties. 
This 
led 
in 
1969 
to 
a 
decisive 
split, 
with 
supporters of the Syndicate 
becoming 
the 
Congress 
(O)—for Organization—while 
supporters of Indira Gandhi 
became the Congress (R)—for 
Requisition. 


Following this split in the Congress, Indira Gandhi began to 
implement policies that challenged the old entrenched economic 
and political elite represented by the Syndicate. Her party won an 
overwhelming majority in parliament. 


This enabled her to change the Indian constitution to limit personal 
property rights. She nationalized many of India’s largest banks, 
insurance companies, and coal mines, promising to use these 
resources for the development and benefit of India’s people. She also

moved India more into an alliance with the Soviet Union and away 
from the U.S. 


When East and West Pakistan fought their civil war in December 
1971, she ordered the Indian army to intervene. This divided 
Pakistan by rapidly liberating Bangladesh. Further asserting her and 
India’s might, in 1974 she ordered the underground testing of what 
she called a peaceful nuclear device. 
Opposition


Indira Gandhi’s more authoritarian control over politics alienated 
many political leaders who had been working for their nation since 
before independence. Among the most prominent of these was 
Jayaprakash Narayan, a well-respected socialist leader. 


During the 1971 election in Indira Gandhi’s home constituency of 
Rae Bareli, there had been some campaigning irregularities. Her 
campaign manager and some of her election expenses had been 
paid by the government, for example, which was technically illegal 
for a political campaign. In June 1975, India’s Supreme Court ruled 
against her, calling her election illegal and ordering her to cease 
voting in parliament. 


Emboldened, Jayaprakash Narayan declared what he called a total 
revolution, even calling on the army and police not to obey Indira 
Gandhi’s illegitimate government. Many labor unions went on 
strike, deeply affecting the Indian economy. 
State of Emergency


Instead of resigning, Indira Gandhi declared an authoritarian 
internal state of emergency. During this state of emergency, which 
lasted for nearly two years, Indira Gandhi directed parliament to 
amend the Indian constitution, placing the prime minister above 
the authority of the courts. Mass imprisonments and newspaper 

Lecture 35—Modernizing India 
295
censorship followed, and the parliamentary elections due in 1976 
were postponed indefinitely. 


Both domestically and internationally, Indira Gandhi asserted 
that national discipline was vital before India could truly develop. 
For example, many of India’s economic gains had been dissipated 
among the rising population, which had increased fifty percent since 
independence, reaching nearly 700 million. 


Indira Gandhi decided that vasectomies were the most effective 
means of contraception. Any man with two or more children was 
“motivated” by the government to undergo this operation. 


During the emergency, she increasingly relied on her second son, 
Sanjay Gandhi. He often acted without restraint. For example, Old 
Delhi had long been home to many Muslim families and various small-
scale industries. Led by Sanjay, the police suddenly cleared away many 
of its densest slums, relocating about half a million of its inhabitants in 
distant locations. He supervised massive vasectomy camps.
The Janata Party


Although widespread resentment against these harsh emergency 
measures grew, few could oppose them openly. Hence, Indira 
Gandhi believed she had popular support. To prove her support, in 
1977 she released her political opponents and ordered the postponed 
parliamentary elections to be held immediately afterward.


United by their opposition to Indira Gandhi, an array of political 
figures joined under the umbrella of the Janata or People’s Party. 
Even members of Indira Gandhi’s own cabinet who had remained 
silent during the emergency split away to join the Janata. This left the 
remnants of her party renamed as the Congress (I), for Indira. 


The Janata Party soundly defeated the Congress (I). Almost all of 
north India, Muslims, and the poor voted against Indira Gandhi. 

A History of India
296


But the Janata Party, having accomplished its almost only uniting 
goal, began to break down into its rival component parties and 
factions. In the 1980 national parliamentary election, Indira Gandhi 
successfully contrasted her strong administration against the 
ineffective Janata. Her Congress (I) won a two-thirds majority. 
Rajiv and Indira


Indira now trusted no one but Sanjay to share her power. She 
made him deputy prime minister, and her heir apparent. But only 
six months after the election, Sanjay crashed his high-performance 
acrobatic plane, killing him and a passenger. 


Suddenly bereft of her son and chosen heir, Indira Gandhi turned to 
her elder son, Rajiv Gandhi, who had originally stayed out of politics 
but reluctantly accepted and became Indira’s heir apparent. 


In her restored regime, Indira Gandhi determined not to be 
challenged politically again. She exercised highly centralized control 
over the Congress (I), allowing only total loyalists to rise. This meant 
that her party had only a very weak organization, relying instead on 
her personal popularity. 
The Khalistan Movement


Indira Gandhi also schemed to weaken rival parties. For instance, 
she tolerated an increasingly armed Sikh separatist movement in 
the Punjab that demanded their own independent separate nation, 
Khalistan. These militants drained support away from the more 
establishment Sikh political party that opposed Indira Gandhi. 


However, by 1984 the Khalistan movement became so violent that 
she finally ordered the Indian Army to assault its fortified arms 
factory in the holiest Sikh site, the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The 
army’s Operation Blue Star destroyed much of the Golden Temple 
and killed hundreds of innocent Sikh pilgrims trapped inside. Many 

Lecture 35—Modernizing India 
297
Sikhs in the army felt betrayed. Indeed, Indira Gandhi’s own Sikh 
bodyguards assassinated her four months later. 


As Rajiv Gandhi rose above his grief and took over the government, 
many of Indira Gandhi’s fervent followers in the national capital 
region took revenge by killing about a thousand innocent Sikhs and 
burning out many more. 


In subsequent years, the army and armed police forcefully crushed 
the Khalistan movement. In 1990 alone, some 4,000 people died in 
the Punjab fighting, many in armed confrontations with the police.

Rajiv’s Efforts


During the period of national mourning for his mother, Rajiv called a 
national election and led the Congress (I) to a strong victory. The party 
won only 48 percent of votes but 80 percent of parliament’s seats. 


But the efforts by Rajiv Gandhi to modernize India rapidly and 
even to retain control over the Congress (I) both faltered. He tried 
to replace the established Congress (I) leaders with technocrats 
including experts in information technology. But this lost the party a 
series of state elections. 


He began opening the Indian economy to world trade, but that 
threatened India’s inefficient industries and the comfortable middle 
classes. 


He tried to appeal to conservative Muslim voters. This created space 
for the rise of a Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, 
or BJP.


In 1987, Rajiv ordered an 80,000-man peacekeeping force to end 
the bloody civil war in Sri Lanka between the Tamil Tigers and the 
Sinhala government. This was a debacle that alienated Tamils in 
India, Sri Lanka, and internationally, and made the world question 
India’s role as regional policeman. 


Rajiv claimed to be above corruption, but mysterious payments 
of millions of dollars into a Swiss bank account suggested his 
involvement. Hence, his popularity plummeted and the Congress (I) 
lost the 1989 national election.
The 1990s and 2000s


Only another weak coalition party, called the Janata Dal, managed to 
scrape together a minority government. It elected Vishwanath Pratap 
Singh as prime minister on the basis of his leading role as a critic of 

Lecture 35—Modernizing India 
299
Rajiv’s alleged corruption. This government survived only briefly 
with the uncertain support of both left political parties and the BJP.


A new election commenced in 1991. Rajiv Gandhi appeared to be 
headed for victory, only to be assassinated while campaigning, 
evidently by a Tamil suicide bomber in revenge for Rajiv’s blundering 
incursion into Sri Lanka. While the Congress (I) managed to form 
a loose governing coalition, the aging compromise prime minister, 
Narasimha Rao, was relatively weak.


India’s economy was also weak. It remained largely based on Nehru’s 
program of large state-owned industries and private companies that 
were highly regulated by licenses and quotas. 


The government began to open up the economy to world trade, a 
process that has hesitatingly continued until today. This has enabled 
entrepreneurial middle- and upper-class businessmen and investors 
to profit greatly from India’s hitherto pent-up but now mostly 
opened markets. 


The Hindu nationalist BJP continued its rise. Many people in the 
majority Hindu community were also among those threatened by the 
Congress (I)’s economic reforms. The BJP also appealed to those who felt 
the Muslim minority had been especially protected by the Congress (I).


The BJP made the Babri Masjid mosque in Ayodhya a symbol of 
Muslim oppression. This mosque was constructed in 1527, allegedly 
on the site of a demolished temple marking the sacred birthplace, 
Janmabhumi, of the god Ram. In 1990 and then in 1992, BJP-led 
assaults on that mosque demolished it. In retaliation, Muslim 
militants set off bombs in Mumbai, which led to anti-Muslim riots. 


In the political instability of the period, a series of very short-lived 
coalition governments struggled to hold power. In 1996, the BJP 
prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee held office for only 13 days 
before losing a vote and having to resign. Two very insecure United 

A History of India
300
Front coalition governments struggled to stay in office over the 
next two years. Meanwhile, desperate to find a unifying focus, the 
Congress turned to Rajiv Gandhi’s widow, Sonia Gandhi. 


A coalition headed by the BJP won the 1998 election. Vajpayee 
returned to office as prime minister for the second time. Vajpayee’s 
coalition was strengthened in the 1999 elections. This time his 
government survived for the full five-year term. This government 
advanced liberalization of the Indian economy and the privatization 
of some state-owned corporations.


But in the 2004 elections, rallying around Sonia Gandhi, the 
Congress led a coalition of 15 political parties that overmatched 
the BJP’s coalition. A respected economist but weak political leader, 
Manmohan Singh, presided as prime minister for two terms. 


Neither of Sonia Gandhi’s children, that is, Nehru’s great-
grandchildren, have emerged as major political figures. Priyanka 
(born in 1972) married a Christian Indian businessman and has 
largely stayed out of politics. Rahul (born 1970) has several times 
entered the political arena but has not proven himself effective there. 


The Congress is currently at one of its very lowest point in terms 
of parliamentary representation and popular support. In contrast, 
a resurgent BJP, under its new dynamic leader, Narendra Modi, 
returned with a resounding victory in 2014.

Lecture 36
South Asia into the 21st Century
T
hroughout this course, we’ve seen how the major themes of South 
Asia’s long history have expressed themselves into the 21st century. 
In this final lecture, we’ll first briefly review some of the larger 
themes that are still important today. Then we’ll turn to consider some 
of the current conditions in each of today’s major South Asian nations 
individually. Finally, we’ll conclude with some of the major issues facing 
South Asia as a whole, now and into the future.
Major Themes


The interacting histories of a complex variety of individuals and 
communities have produced South Asia’s vast diversity. Starting 
some 60,000–70,000 years ago, various groups with their own 
cultural heritage and social organization immigrated and settled in 
each ecologically specific region of the subcontinent. 


A pattern found in many regions has been pastoralists and shifting 
agriculturalists settling as farmers, then clearing farmland by cutting 
down forests and pushing back forest-dependent people. 


Today, the resource demands of cities and industries are putting 
further stresses on the remaining forest-dwelling communities. 
Tensions among these several different ways of life continue, 
for example, when settled villagers or the government claim 
exclusive forest rights and exclude herders and Adivasis who have 
traditionally used those forests as well. 


Rural populations have been migrating temporarily or permanently 
to cities for centuries. But the rate has dramatically increased in recent 
decades. Among the dozen largest megacities in the world today are 

A History of India
302
India’s Delhi and Mumbai, Pakistan’s Karachi, and Bangladesh’s 
Dhaka, with populations of 15 million or more each.


Other identities, like social and economic status and religious beliefs 
and practices, also vary at the very local level, by region, and across 
the subcontinent. There are inequities based on class, caste, and 
gender within each region and nation, although to different degrees. 
We’ve also seen how much political differentiation there has always 
been and remains today within South Asia. 


From the 3rd century B.C.E. onward, only relatively short-lived 
empires have sporadically conquered much of South Asia. The two 
longest lasting of these empires were the Mughal Empire, which 
lasted from the mid-16th through the 17th centuries before gradually 
fragmenting, and the British Empire, which lasted from the late 18th 
to the mid-20th centuries. 


South Asia’s present political division into the separate independent 
nations of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh is not unusual. Each 
nation is a product of its regional and transregional histories, with 
many geographical boundaries set by the British colonial Raj being 
still disputed. 


Another major South Asian theme is the relationship between South 
Asians and the surrounding world. For the last five centuries, this 
has encompassed the entire globe, especially via European ships 
during the colonial period. 
South Asia Today


The nation that dominates South Asia in population, geographical 
size, and economic, political, and military power is the Republic 
of India. Over the next decade, it will become the largest nation in 
the world, surpassing China. India also is emerging as an economic 
powerhouse with ever more influence in the world. But, like the 

Lecture 36—South Asia into the 21st Century 
303
other South Asian countries, the issue of national identity remains 
heatedly debated. 


Jawaharlal Nehru and his political allies and heirs stressed the 
secular, incorporative nature of the nation. Meanwhile, the current 
Bharatiya Janata Party government and other parties on the so-called 
Hindu right have accused the Congress party of being pseudo-
secularist—that is, of not treating all of Bharat’s citizens equally. 


At this time, the current Congress leadership is quite weak. 
The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty has led the Congress since Indian 
independence. With the one exception of the two-year state of 
emergency from 1975–1977, India has been highly unusual among 
former colonies around the world for its strong and continuous 
commitment to democracy. 


The Congress party largely held together, despite various splits, 
due to the primacy of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. Even today, the 
strongest figure in the Congress is Rajiv Gandhi’s widow, Sonia, 
although she is an Italian-born immigrant. 


In contrast, in recent decades, the BJP has, with some setbacks, been 
sporadically rising across the north and center of India especially. 
BJP prime minister A. B. Vajpayee held office three times, the longest 
from 1998 to 2004, but as the head of a loose coalition of parties. In 
2014, BJP prime minister Narendra Modi won a decisive victory that 
has allowed him to lead a unified, largely one-party government. 


In addition to the Congress and the BJP, there are various smaller 
parties that have their own platforms. The several communist and 
other left-leaning political parties have not succeeded in expanding 
beyond their respective regional bases.


There are also small parties that primarily represent particular caste 
groupings, including the Bahujan Samaj Party, which appeals to 
Dalits, people historically degraded as untouchables. Even more 

A History of India
304
marginalized groups have turned to Maoist-style revolution. Up 
to a third of India’s districts, almost all of them rural and heavily 
forested areas where Adivasis live, are currently the sites of such 
left-wing insurgency. 
Pakistani and Bangladeshi Identity


Pakistan was partitioned off in 1947 as a nation for Muslims. It 
contains the 6th largest population of any country on earth. But 
debate continues among its citizens about how much being Muslim 
should matter in their identity. 


Even among practicing Muslims, there are disagreements about how 
Islamic the government should be. In some parts of Pakistan, Sharia 
law is already in place. In most of the country, however, it is not. 


As in the Republic of India, strong regional identities have cut across 
Pakistan’s national identity. This occurred most dramatically in 1971, 
when the eastern wing seceded as independent Bangladesh. 


The issue of Bengali versus Muslim identities is still debated. The 
party strongly in power at this time, the Awami League, has tended 
to highlight Bengali identity. The main opposition, the Bangladesh 
Nationalist Party, is currently weaker than it has been for most of its 
history, as are its frequent Islamist political partners. 


Many of the services that the Bangladesh government has not been 
adequately providing are made available by nongovernmental 
organizations, or NGOs. Some are international, but many of the 
strongest are domestic. 


The two largest Bangladeshi NGOs are the Grameen Bank, started in 
1976 by Nobel Prize–winner Muhammad Yunus, and BRAC, started 
by Sir Fazle Hasan Abed in 1972. 

Lecture 36—South Asia into the 21st Century 
305


Between them and other NGOs, nearly all poor Bangladeshi women 
have access to microcredit. Making small loans to millions of women 
has enabled them to start to lift their families out of a cycle of debt 
and thus above poverty. In addition, both BRAC and the Grameen 
Bank provide an array of other services, including education, 
communications, and healthcare. 
Demographics


Together, the people of South Asia make up 20 percent of the world’s 
population, yet they live on less than 3 percent of its landmass. 
About a third of the world’s poor live in South Asia. 


South Asia is facing a critical period when water, energy, and other 
natural resources are overstrained by ever larger populations and 
increased agricultural and industrial production. 


This rapid growth has resulted in relatively young populations. This 
could produce a labor pool approaching its peak productivity just 
at the time when China, Japan, and Europe’s workforces are aging. 
But if these young men and women remain unemployed, their 
frustration could erupt in social disorder. Hence, each South Asian 
nation is attempting to reduce the rate of population rise and to grow 
its economy to make jobs for its youth.


Yet another issue is gender disparity. Due to the economic and 
cultural preference for sons rather than daughters, most regions have 
very imbalanced sex ratios. There are many million fewer women in 
the population than would be expected statistically. 


Anemia, stunting, and other results of chronic malnutrition affect 
many women, leading to higher mortality in childbearing. Women in 
most regions of South Asia have markedly lower literacy rates than 
men. Since primary education for women is one of the most efficient 
ways of increasing the quality of life for everyone, this is an area 

A History of India
306
that each government in South Asia is addressing, although to far 
different degrees.


India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh have each had one or more women 
prime ministers or provincial chief ministers. Indira Gandhi was 
elected prime minister in 1966 and again in 1980. In Pakistan, Benazir 
Bhutto was elected in 1988 and again in 1993. And in Bangladesh, 
Begum Khaleda Zia was elected in 1991 and again in 2001. She 
alternated with Sheikh Hasina, who was elected in 1996, in 2009, and 
yet again in 2014. 


Some of the fieriest regional leaders are single women. In Bengal, 
Mamata Banerjee leads the Trinamool (or Grassroots) Congress. 
In Tamil Nadu, Jayalalitha leads the AIADMK. In Uttar Pradesh, 
Mayawati leads the Bhaujan Samaj Party. Each has been chief 
minister between one and five times. Significantly, none has married 
but rather each has risen due to her own political charisma, although 
Jayalalitha and Mayavati had male mentors who advanced their 
careers initially.

Lecture 36—South Asia into the 21st Century 
307
Commerce and Globalization


There is a relatively small but growing commerce among South 
Asian nations. That commerce is dwarfed by trade with the more 
prosperous economies elsewhere. 


Globalization has brought opportunities and benefits to many 
South Asians, but also threats and costs to others. The globalized 
production of clothing has created work for semiskilled workers. 
However, these jobs are low paying and often dangerous. 


Tens of millions of emigrants from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh 
and their descendants have been contributing greatly to the countries 
in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and elsewhere in Asia where they 
have settled. They also assist in spreading their cultural heritage 
worldwide, for instance, their cuisine, yoga, and Bollywood cinema. 


Many emigres have done very well in business, the computer 
industry, the medical and educational professions, and in other fields 
where entrepreneurship can lead to success. Several members of the 
United States Congress and the governors of Louisiana and South 
Carolina have been of Indian origin. In Britain, several members 
of the House of Commons and House of Lords are of South Asian 
descent. 
Future Challenges


Many global forces are beyond the power of South Asians to 
control, like climate change. Rising sea levels flood low-lying coasts, 
especially during tidal surges. Dire predictions project the permanent 
flooding of about 15 percent of the entire nation of Bangladesh by the 
end of this century. 


South Asia is a tectonic plate that is grinding into Asia. This 
produces major earthquakes every half-dozen years. Similarly, the 
2004 tsunami devastated coastal regions, with some damage still not 
repaired. 

A History of India
308


Much of the “carbon space” in the world’s atmosphere has already 
filled up by European and American emissions over the last two 
centuries, causing today’s climate change. One South Asian demand 
has been “environmental justice,” the right to produce more 
greenhouse gases until they reach the average per capita output of 
Westerners. 


Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi politicians also have negotiated 
billions of dollars for environmental improvements, paid by already 
developed nations.


In future, the people of South Asia will continue to emerge as a 
vital part of humanity. India in particular may replace China as 
the world’s most dynamic developing economy, with Pakistan and 
Bangladesh substantially increasing their contributions as well.


Politically, each of these relatively new nations faces challenges, 
including international terrorism, the threat of nuclear war, and 
internal social, religious, and sub-national tensions. But the people of 
each nation have proven themselves resilient.
