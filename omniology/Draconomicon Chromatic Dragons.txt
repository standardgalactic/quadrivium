Dragon Lore
Dragon Lore
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
—William Shakespeare
More ink has been spilled on describing drag-
ons than on nearly any other creature. These ancient, 
noble, yet savage beasts are a favorite subject of guide-
books, bards’ tales, and ancient tomes and scrolls. 
Draconic knowledge is gained at risk of life and limb; 
dragons are rapacious, jealous of their secrets, and 
often hungry.
 
Experts describe dragons as the first sentient race 
to appear in the world, with life spans stretching into 
millennia. With such a wealth of experience, dragons 
embody history. The oldest dragons are repositories 
of vast knowledge and of the deepest ancient secrets. 
Dragons are more than just a challenge for knights 
seeking hoards or glory: dragons are sages, oracles, 
and even prophets.
 
Dragons’ majesty has clothed them in myth. The 
appearance of a dragon can portend good or ill for-
tune. Pragmatic sages attempt to classify dragons 
as merely large lizards that have wings and warm 
breath, but these efforts fail in the true light of the 
wonder, magic, and fantastic abilities of dragons.
 
Dragons are, by their nature, epic forces.
This chapter covers the following topics:
✦Origins: The beginnings and history of chromatic 
dragons.
✦Physiology: A detailed study of chromatic drag-
ons’ anatomy.
✦ Life Cycle: The life of a dragon from egg to 
ancient.
✦ Outlook and Psychology: How chromatic drag-
ons see the world.
✦ Society: A description of dragon social structure.
✦ Language: Draconic language and script.
✦ Religion: Dragons’ favored deities.
✦ Chromatic Dragons in Detail: An overview 
of the five most common chromatic dragons—
black, blue, green, red, and white—as well as the 
lesser-known brown, gray, and purple dragons.

FRANCIS TSAI
Only the most arrogant enthusiast might claim cer-
tain knowledge of dragons’ origins, and such a claim 
should be taken with a grain of salt. Legends and 
the knowledge that sages do have, however, stretch 
back for centuries and hint at what might have been. 
Sometimes new stories come to light, prompting 
reassessments of the existing body of knowledge and 
speculation regarding dragon inception.
First Dragons
The five major dragon families (chromatic, cata-
strophic, metallic, scourge, and planar; see the 
Monster Manual for details) share a common origin. 
Most accounts begin with mention of the deity Io.
 
Io, as legend has it, created dragons in his own 
shape but without a divine spark, so that dragons 
might frolic and exult in the new world formed by 
the primordials. To Io, dragons were the epitome 
of mortal form. Though they lived in the world, the 
power of the Elemental Chaos flowed in their veins 
and spewed from their mouths in gouts of flame or 
waves of paralyzing cold. They also developed keen 
minds and lofty spirits that linked them, as with all 
sentient mortal beings, to the Astral Sea.
The Sundering
During the wars between the primordials and the 
gods that followed the world’s creation, the primor-
dial known as the King of Terror attacked and slew 
Io and the dragons defending Io. According to one 
account, the dragon deities Tiamat and Bahamut rose 
from the two halves of Io’s corpse. Another legend 
claims that Tiamat and Bahamut were among Io’s 
eldest creations and received their father’s divine 
spark upon his death.
 
Io’s remaining children found their position less 
secure than they had believed it to be. Forced to adapt 
to a changing world, they chose diverse philosophies 
and lifestyles to reflect their individual natures.
 
A number of surviving dragons chose to follow 
Bahamut, called the Platinum Dragon, and they 
became the first metallic dragons. Over the ages, 
as Bahamut upheld justice, opposed evil, and liber-
ated the oppressed, creatures other than dragons 
came to honor him as the deity of justice, protection, 
nobility, and honor. In the fullness of time, he has 
become better known for those attributes than for his 
association with metallic dragons. Today, all metallic 
dragons revere Bahamut as their originator, but not 
all of them worship him.

PHYSIOLOGY
 
Other dragons that survived Io’s death embraced 
their physical link to the Elemental Chaos, allow-
ing the power within them to manifest externally. 
They became disasters incarnate, taking the forms 
of fantastic catastrophes that shook the world and 
that continue to wreak havoc millennia later. When 
a mountain explodes, a catastrophic dragon might 
erupt from it along with sprays of molten rock. When 
a cyclone or a hurricane rages, a catastrophic dragon 
might lurk at the eye of the storm, reveling in the 
destruction. Catastrophic dragons care little for 
wealth or power. They seek to make their marks on 
the world, literally, and to have others fear and propi-
tiate them.
 
The order of scourge dragons also arose from 
among the survivors of Io’s death. Similar to the 
way catastrophic dragons embraced their link to the 
Elemental Chaos, scourge dragons (also called lin-
norms) celebrated their connection to brute reality. 
They learned to visit afflictions upon living creatures. 
Almost universally evil, scourge dragons enjoy the 
raw physicality of melee combat.
 
The remainder of Io’s surviving dragon children 
threw in their lot with Tiamat, whose hatred of the 
world that killed her father colored her every deed 
and attracted dragons given to rapacity and suspicion: 
the chromatics. Chromatic dragons have become 
the best-known dragon family thanks to their often-
antagonistic relationship with humanoids. Like 
Bahamut, Tiamat matured into a deity appealing to 
more than just her dragon kin. Today, as the evil deity 
of wealth, greed, and envy, she urges her followers to 
take vengeance for every slight. Most chromatic drag-
ons follow this dictate.
 
Planar dragons are categorized as the fifth family 
of dragons, but planar dragons did not appear until 
long after the other dragon classes matured in the 
aftermath of Io’s dissolution. Dragons that emigrated 
to offworld planes were affected by their environ-
ment, sometimes radically. Chromatic dragons seem 
most susceptible, and later generations of these 
planar dragons bear only slight resemblances to their 
worldly kin.
PHYSIOLOGY
As any would-be dragonslayer should know, dragons—
also called wyrms—are far more than merely giant 
beasts or winged lizards. Chromatic dragons’ abilities 
set them at the top of the food chain and make them 
the most potent hunters of the natural world.
Dragon Traits
What, exactly, makes a dragon? Other magical, rep-
tilian beasts have great power. A few creatures, such 
PHYSIOLOGY
PHYSIOLOGY
as drakes and wyverns, share certain characteristics 
with dragons. What sets dragons apart from them?
 
All true dragons have distinct age categories and 
grow in power and strength as they progress through 
those categories. Every chromatic dragon has both a 
breath weapon and an array of supernatural abilities, 
including an aura that induces overwhelming fear. 
All chromatic dragons also have the same basic body 
structure.
External Anatomy
Covered in scales, possessed of four legs and a long, 
writhing tail, a dragon appears to be a giant reptile at 
first glance. Nevertheless, dragons are a classification 
unto themselves, with characteristics of predatory 
mammals as well as reptiles. In fact, a dragon’s exter-
nal anatomy—with four legs directly beneath the body 
rather than splayed to the sides—is more mammalian 
than reptilian.
Sense Organs
At the center of a dragon’s eye is a thin, vertical pupil, 
like that of a cat. Whereas a cat’s pupil expands to 
admit more light in dark areas, however, the expan-
sion of a dragon’s pupil allows primal energy flowing 
in the creature’s bloodstream to emanate from the 
pupil (see “Internal Anatomy”). This minute seepage 
of magic grants a dragon its darkvision.
 
Chromatic dragons do not have external ears. 
As with snakes, an internal mechanism detects 
sounds. From the outside, the only evidence of this 
mechanism is a tiny hole between the scales. Some 
dragons have frills or fringes of scales along their 
heads; in such cases, one such set of scales might sur-
round the auditory canal, focusing sound inward in 
a manner similar to that of a mammal’s external ear. 
These scales are not, however, a necessary part of the 
design.
 
Due to their scales and thick hides, chromatic 
dragons have a poor tactile sense. Hence, a dragon 
can be comfortable sleeping on a jagged pile of 
treasure, as long as the pile vaguely conforms to the 
dragon’s shape. Dragons are, however, sensitive to 
pain. Anything capable of penetrating their hide and 
scales receives their full attention.
 
A chromatic dragon’s sense of smell is split 
between its nostrils and its tongue. The nasal aper-
ture can detect odors from a great distance, but that 
aperture is less capable than the tongue of differen-
tiating an odor’s components. When a dragon draws 
near the source of an interesting scent, its flickering 
tongue identifies and pinpoints various odors, much 
as a snake’s tongue does.
 
The tongue is also a dragon’s organ of taste. 
Dragons can detect nuances of flavor better than 
humanoids can. For example, a dragon could 

8
C H A P T E R  1  |  D ra g o n  L o re
describe every ingredient of a stew after ingesting a 
single large mouthful.
Jaws and Teeth
As with a crocodile, the muscles that close a dragon’s 
jaw are more powerful than the ones that open it—yet 
only the mightiest foe could hope to hold a dragon’s 
jaw shut if a dragon wants to open it. The teeth, also 
resembling those of a crocodile, include fangs for 
tearing and puncturing, incisors for severing flesh 
from bone, and a series of molars for gripping and 
grinding.
 
The jaw can also unhinge, stretching a dragon’s 
maw to massive proportions similar to the way a 
snake’s jaws unhinge. Dragons rarely display this 
ability, because they use it only to bite larger foes or 
to swallow prey too tough to be torn into smaller bits. 
The throat can stretch wide enough to accommodate 
anything the unhinged jaws can encompass, though 
swallowing something so large that a dragon must 
unhinge its jaw is a painful experience.
 
A dragon’s teeth and fangs consist of a hard sub-
stance more closely related to the substance of a 
dragon’s bones (see “Skeletal System”) than to the 
enamel and dentin that comprise the teeth of most 
creatures. Similarly, the interior of the tooth resem-
bles marrow more than it does pulp.
 
A dragon grows a new set of teeth each time it 
increases in size. Between these periods, if a dragon 
loses a tooth, it has to do without unless it has a 
means of healing magically.
Spines, Claws, and Horns
All dragons have some combination of protrusions in 
the form of spines, claws, horns, or all three. These 
protrusions are made of a substance similar to that 
of dragons’ teeth. They are not keratinous, as are the 
horns of most horned animals, nor have they the 
same composition as dragon bones, though they’re 
close.
 
Spines are anchored in muscle, connected to the 
skeleton by a series of ligaments. Claws and horns 
connect directly to the skeleton. Horns and spines 
grow as a dragon grows. Its claws, like its teeth, fall 
out and regrow when a dragon increases its size.
 
A dragon’s feet have both reptilian and avian 
characteristics. A foot normally has three forward-
facing claws plus a single claw near the rear of the 
foot, though a significant minority of chromatic 
dragons has four forward-facing claws. The rear claw 
normally faces backward when a dragon is walk-
ing or running, but it can twist forward to serve as 
something akin to an opposable thumb. Although the 
rear claw is not fully prehensile or as dexterous as a 
human hand, it does allow a dragon to grip objects 
and even to use tools or writing styluses if they’re 
properly sized and designed for draconic use.
Scales
The texture of a dragon’s hide depends, in part, on a 
dragon’s variety. For instance, a typical black dragon’s 
outer layer of scales feels rough and leathery, like that 
of an alligator, whereas a green dragon’s scales gener-
ally feel smoother, like hardened snakeskin. These 
tendencies are not absolute. For example, the hides of 
black dragons from different bloodlines might have 
markedly different textures.
 
In any case, individual scales are more or less 
the same. The way they fit together determines the 
skin’s texture. Larger scales, such as those that cover 
the head, neck, and back, connect to the skin at one 
end and overlap neighboring scales at the other. This 
arrangement creates a layer that resembles scale 
armor or shingles on a roof. Smaller scales, such as 
those that cover a dragon’s underside, rest side by side 
rather than overlapping.
 
Dragon scales are slightly more flexible than steel 
and substantially stronger, making them perfect 
armor. Unfortunately for those who desire to make 
armor from dragon scales, harvesting scales is dif-
ficult, and armor constructed from such scales lasts 
only a few weeks after it is taken from a living dragon. 
Everyone knows stories of unique sets of magic armor 
made of dragon scales, but it might be impossible to 
construct a mundane armor from harvested scales 
without a long-lost creation ritual.
 
A dragon never sheds its skin, since its scales grow 
slowly throughout the course of its life. It occasionally 
loses individual scales through injury or illness or 
as a result of natural molting. These patches remain 
bare for a few months at most, before replacement 
scales grow large enough to fill the gap.
Wings
A chromatic dragon’s wings are simple in structure. 
Each consists of a membrane of thin hide stretched 
across a structure of lightweight bones, like a bat’s 
wing.
 
Each wing is large enough that nothing short of 
numerous large tears can threaten a membrane’s 
integrity. As a result, it’s difficult to injure a dragon so 
severely that it cannot fly. Such tears heal relatively 
quickly.
Internal Anatomy
Many details that differentiate dragons from other 
creatures are internal. Although a dragon’s scales and 
flesh somewhat resemble those of reptiles, a different 
story unfolds underneath.

VINOD RAMS
PHYSIOLOGY
Major Organs
 
Brain (1): A dragon’s brain is large both in abso-
lute terms and as a proportion of body mass. A 
significant part of the brain is dedicated to memory 
and reasoning, and other parts control two functions 
unique to dragons: the mystical power of the eyes and 
the channeling of learned behaviors into the instinc-
tive, “reptilian” brain.
 
Directly above the sensory centers of the cerebral 
cortex, a dragon has an extra growth—a miniature 
lobe—that has a direct synaptic connection to the 
optic nerves. Sages believe that this growth gener-
ates a dragon’s frightful presence. Although not a true 
gaze attack, the effect emanates from the eyes, which 
might be why the legend arose that dragons have a 
hypnotic gaze. This miniature lobe draws mystical 
power from blood that flows through the brain. After 
a dragon expends that power, it must concentrate 
for a few moments to reinvigorate the lobe and thus 
ready the ability for another use.
 
The second major factor that sets a dragon’s brain 
apart from those of other creatures is the connec-
tion of the learning and memory portions of the 
brain with the so-called reptilian brain, which is 
responsible for rage, the fight-or-flight mechanism, 
and other instinctive behaviors. Thick clusters of syn-
apses form this connection, incorporating anything 
a dragon learns into its instinctive behavior. Learned 
techniques such as effective combat and hunting 
tactics become an innate part of the wyrm’s auto-
matic responses. Knowledge even passes to offspring. 
Young dragons inherit all their parents’ instincts and 
reactive behavior, including those traits that the par-
ents have developed from their own memories and 
experiences.
Larynx and Trachea (2 and 3): The larynx con-
tains an array of vocal cords slightly more complex 
than a human’s. Although most dragons prefer to 
speak in a narrow range of tones, a dragon can pro-
duce any sound from a dull rumble to a shriek so 
high-pitched that human ears can scarcely detect it. 
The trachea, as in most creatures, is the passage for a 
dragon’s respiration.
Lungs (4): The lungs take up an enormous por-
tion of a dragon’s chest cavity, given that they must 
oxygenate the blood for such a massive creature. 
They more closely resemble avian lungs than those 
of reptiles or mammals. They extract oxygen on both 
inhalation and exhalation.
Heart (5): A dragon’s heart is the source of its 
dragon’s power. This huge, four-chambered organ 
pumps strongly enough to send blood flowing 
throughout the enormous beast. Legend has it that 
if a dragon’s heart could be filled with granite, the 
strength of the heart’s constriction would crush the 
stone to powder.
 
The heart also generates the elemental energy 
that grants chromatic dragons their breath weapons

and other powers. It is a dragon’s most magical 
aspect. Without the mystical energy distributed by 
their hearts, dragons might be merely intelligent 
lizards. This energy suffuses the entire body through 
the blood. For parts of the body that require more 
focused power, the fundamentum (see below) is a 
more direct conduit.
 
A dragon’s blood is somewhat thinner than human 
blood and is darker, appearing black in dim light-
ing. The blood’s temperature depends on the variety 
of dragon. Red dragon blood gives off steam, white 
dragon blood is barely above freezing, and so forth.
Fundamentum (6): The fundamentum is an 
organ unique to dragons. Once thought to be the 
source of a dragon’s breath weapon, the fundamentum 
is an enormous blood vessel, like an extremely large, 
complex artery. The fundamentum channels the 
energy-rich blood from the heart directly into the 
upper stomach of a dragon’s gizzard.
 
When examined outside a dragon, the funda-
mentum looks something like a rubbery hose, with a 
muscular outer layer capable of pumping blood simi-
lar to the way the heart does. This outer layer allows 
the fundamentum to constrict and open rapidly from 
one end to the other, propelling a wash of blood into 
the upper stomach.
 
Gizzard (7): The gizzard of a chromatic dragon 
contains two hollows: a smaller “upper stomach” and 
the gizzard chamber. Elemental energy, transferred 
from the heart through the fundamentum, remains 
in the upper stomach until needed. This energy either 
aids in digestion—in which case it flows into the giz-
zard whenever food arrives from the esophagus—or it 
comprises a dragon’s breath weapon.
A dragon’s bloodied breath ability derives from the fact 
that the breath weapon is fueled by the same energy that 
fuels the beast’s digestive process. When a dragon is badly 
injured, its body releases a surge of adrenaline directly into 
the bloodstream, which in turn sends a rush of elemental 
energy coursing through the creature’s organs.
 
To prepare for the incoming flux of power, a dragon’s 
digestive tract purges the energy already held within. In 
essence, a dragon vomits bloodied breath from within its 
gizzard rather than from the upper stomach that usually 
stores the energy.
 
The gizzard takes a few moments to “refuel,” since, 
during combat, nearly all the energy pumped from the 
heart goes to the breath weapon. Hence, bloodied breath 
recharges only after a short rest. A dragon must go a 
few minutes without using its breath weapon before the 
upper stomach once again begins feeding energy into 
the gizzard.

PHYSIOLOGY
 
In truth, “breath weapon” is a misnomer, since 
the fire, poison, acid, or other substance discharges 
not from the lungs but from the upper stomach. The 
stream of energy is more accurately vomited than 
exhaled.
 
Traces of this energy might leak from a dragon’s 
upper stomach into the esophagus, mouth, and nos-
trils, from which they might emerge as puffs of smoke 
or wisps of poison—another reason people believe the 
breath weapon is part of the respiratory system. This 
leaking energy also causes the damage dealt by most 
dragons’ bite attacks.
 
After food reaches the gizzard, the hard plates 
inside the organ, similar in composition to the horns 
and teeth, grind it up. The upper stomach bathes the 
swallowed food in energy from its pool.
Muscular System
The musculature of a dragon somewhat resembles 
that of a great hunting cat from neck to rump and 
that of a constrictor serpent along the neck and tail. 
The area that defies comparison is the area at the 
wing-base and along the chest.
 
Wing and chest muscles are dense and larger 
than any other muscle group in the wyrm’s anatomy. 
Despite their great power, however, they could not 
provide lift to such a massive beast without magical 
assistance. Sages postulate that the elemental energy 
coursing through a dragon’s cardiovascular system 
contributes to the beast’s ability to fly. According 
to this theory, magic in the wings grants a dragon 
strength beyond that provided by the muscles.
 
The alar pectoral (1) is the main flight muscle, 
used on the wing’s downstroke. The alar latissimus 
dorsi (2) draws the wing up and back, and the alar 
deltoid (3) and alar cleidomastoid (4) draw them up 
and forward.
 
The muscles of the wings themselves serve primar-
ily to control the wings’ shape, aiding a dragon’s aerial 
maneuverability. The alar tricep (5) and alar bicep (6) 
fold and unfold the wings, and the alar carpi ulnaris 
(7) and alar carpi radialus (8) allow the wings to wrap 
and twist.
 
In addition to being the strongest muscle group 
in a dragon’s body, the pectoral muscles are also the 
most enduring. Enormous quantities of blood flow in 
and out of the muscles regularly, sweeping away—or 
even destroying, thanks to the blood’s innate energy—
toxins that cause fatigue. A dragon can fly for many 
minutes at full speed, for hours at a reasonable pace, 
and for days on end if it relies substantially on glid-
ing and updrafts. Dragons maintain their average 
overland flight speeds by switching back and forth 
between true flight and periods of gliding.
Skeletal System
A dragon’s skeletal system consists of more than 
five hundred separate bones. As with the muscular

C H A P T E R  1  |  D ra g o n  L o re
system, the skeleton between a dragon’s neck and 
rump—the bones of its legs and torso—somewhat 
resembles the skeleton of a great feline, although the 
neck and tail bones more closely resemble those of 
serpents. The bones in and around the wings, like the 
muscles thereof, defy comparison.
 
Dragon bone is strong. In fact, it is stronger than 
any known nonmagical material other than ada-
mantine, in terms of the amount of pressure it can 
withstand. As with scales, when bone is removed 
from a dragon’s body, it becomes relatively brittle. If 
a person were to consider dragon bone as a building 
material, good-quality stone or heavy wood would 
ultimately make better choices because of their com-
parable durability and wider availability.
 
Dragon bones are hollow like those of birds, 
making them remarkably light for their size and 
strength. The marrow within is yet another reposi-
tory of the elemental energy that flows through the 
bloodstream.
 
The sternum (1) serves as an anchor for a dragon’s 
flight muscles, and the scapula draconis (2) sup-
ports the wing. The metacarpis draconis (3) and alar 
phalanges (4) in each wing support the wing’s flight 
surface.
Metabolism
People assume that dragons are cold-blooded due 
to their apparently reptilian nature. In truth, a 
dragon does not depend upon the environment for 
warmth, but rather maintains a consistent internal 
temperature. By broad definition, that makes dragons 
warm-blooded, but true warm-blooded creatures 
maintain their body temperature by increasing their 
metabolic rate when the environment grows cold 
and by slowing their metabolism and shedding heat—
through sweating, panting, or similar methods—when 
the environment warms.
 
The elemental energy flowing through a dragon’s 
bloodstream, on the other hand, maintains the 
wyrm’s proper range of internal temperatures, 
regardless of external environment. Even dragons 
whose breath weapons have no intrinsic temperature 
requirements—such as breath weapons of poison or 
acid—use that energy to maintain internal heat. Natu-
rally, dragons that have fire- or heat-based attacks 
maintain the highest body temperatures, and those 
that use cold or necrotic energy maintain low body 
temperatures.
 
A dragon can enter a long sleep similar to a state of 
hibernation. Such a sleep allows the creature to pass 
decades or even centuries without waking. Dragons 
might enter this sleep as a way of surviving periods of 
famine without having to find a new lair, grieving the 
loss of a loved one, or withdrawing from the world out 
of sheer ennui.
Diet
Because dragons make use of supernatural energy as 
part of their digestive process, they can consume and 
digest all sorts of food. They can also consume sub-
stances that wouldn’t qualify as food to other living 
creatures.
 
Dragons are predators—instinctive hunters at 
the top of the food chain. They find meat and other 
organic material the easiest fare to digest. When 
meat is unavailable, dragons resort to eating large 
plants, such as trees and large bushes.
 
In emergencies, when the alternative is starvation, 
dragons might eat anything they can swallow: dead 
wood, rock, and other inorganic materials. Dragons 
find these substances distasteful. Furthermore, since 
rock, for instance, holds little nutritional value, a 
dragon must eat a lot more of such a substance than it 
needs of organic material—at least as much as its own 
body weight per day to maintain health. Dragons con-
sider such measures humiliating, to the extent that 
some dragons, particularly reds, prefer to starve for a 
time rather than depend on food they weren’t meant 
to eat.
 
The elemental aspect of a dragon’s digestive 
system, in addition to allowing the creature to eat 
substances others cannot, also makes it hyperefficient 
at digesting meats and other normal foods. Although 
a dragon can consume more than half its body weight 
in such food over the course of a day—and many do 
just that, with sufficient prey—a dragon needs to eat 
only about 15 to 20 percent of its body weight in 
organic food on a daily basis.
 
At the other end of the scale, a dragon must eat 
an obscene amount of food to gain weight. Reports of 
the black dragon “Queen” Gulgol, one of the few truly 
obese dragons known to modern-day sages and adven-
turers, say she eats more than twice her own body 
weight per day. (For more on Gulgol, see page 238.)
 
Dragons might make use of their breath weapons
even when hunting prey that could not possibly sur-
vive a melee encounter. Some dragons breathe on 
prey that is already dead. Since dragons use the same 
energy in digestion that they use for their breath weap-
ons, they find it easier to digest prey that they have 
already bathed in their particular form of energy. A 
red dragon, for instance, can more swiftly digest—and 
thus prefers the taste of—prey that has been charred 
by fire. White dragons find it easier to digest prey 
when it is frozen solid, purple dragons have an easier 
time with prey that has begun to decay, and so forth.
Consuming Magic Items
On rare occasions, a dragon might consume magic 
items rather than add them to its hoard. The crea-
ture’s supernatural digestive system processes magic 
items more easily than nonmagical objects; a dragon 
gains as much nutrition from magic items as it does 

13
C H A P T E R  1  |  D ra g o n  L o re
LIFE CYCLE
from meat. Only if a dragon were starving to the 
point of death, though, would it eat a magic item 
purely to sate its hunger.
 
A dragon might eat a magic item for other reasons. 
When a dragon anticipates going into battle, it might 
consume a magic item in preparation, because the 
dragon could make use of the bonuses and abilities 
of the item for approximately 24 hours after eating 
it. For instance, a dragon that consumes a magic 
weapon gains that weapon’s enhancement bonuses 
to its melee attacks and can use any of the weapon’s 
powers according to the rules for that weapon, or a 
dragon that consumes a ring of invisibility can turn 
invisible, following the rules of the ring. A dragon can 
use only the powers of one item it consumes at a time, 
no matter how many it eats. The item remains intact 
in the dragon’s gullet; cutting it free is a standard 
action after the dragon is slain.
 
The DM must exercise judgment when using this 
ability. Some magic items do not bestow magic upon 
a dragon when eaten. (And be sure to check the item 
against the dragon’s magic threshold: see the Dungeon 
Master’s Guide, page 174,) A dragon accomplishes little 
by eating a portable hole or a bag of holding. Restrict 
this ability to items that grant powers to their wearers 
or bestow enhancement bonuses to their wielders. 
Exercise common sense.
 
Dragons use this ability only rarely because magic 
items are more valuable in the hoard than in the 
gullet. When danger threatens, though, a dragon 
might resort to eating a magic item—particularly if 
the dragon has a number of items that it cannot use, 
such as magic weapons.
LIFE CYCLE
More so those that of other creatures, a dragon’s life 
cycle and life span shape its capabilities and even 
its personality. Barring violence or disease, even the 
shortest-lived chromatic dragon can expect to see a 
score of centuries. Members of other dragon families, 
LIFE CYCLE

such as the metallics, might live even longer than 
chromatic dragons do.
 
Everyone who makes even a cursory study of 
dragons knows of their four main stages of life, which 
sages have dubbed young, adult, elder, and ancient. In 
truth, dragons must first pass through an earlier stage 
that few adventurers see: wyrmling. They also pass 
through a final stage called twilight.
 
The text that follows is written in generalities. It 
discusses the rates at which most chromatic drag-
ons develop, and the activities undertaken by most 
chromatic dragons of a given age. The activities of 
individuals of different temperaments will fly in the 
face of conventional wisdom. Use this information 
as a baseline on which to model dragons, but do not 
allow it to constrain you.
Mating
Although the specifics of mating rites and relation-
ships vary from one kind of dragon to another, several 
commonalities exist. Young dragons can mate, and 
might do so out of sheer biological urge—or even, at 
times, for love—but they are rarely prepared to rear 
young. They might abandon clutches of eggs wherever 
the eggs will have a decent chance of survival. Few 
eggs left in this way survive—and dragons that hatch 
from them might not learn to fend for themselves 
well enough before becoming prey.
 
By the time they reach adulthood, even evil or self-
ish dragons have developed a measure of parenting 
instinct. They keep their eggs in their lairs, watching 
over them to ensure safe incubation. Most mated 
pairs remain together until the eggs hatch, though 
at other times a single parent—often the female, but 
sometimes the male—cares for the eggs alone. Some-
times the adults stay together even after eggs hatch. A 
black dragon is most likely to leave a mate to care for 
the eggs alone, with white and gray dragons the next 
most likely. Other chromatics stay together until the 
hatchlings can fend for themselves, at which point 
the pair splits up.
Although it is rare for different varieties of chromatic 
dragons to mate, and even rarer for the pairing to pro-
duce a viable egg, a few draconic “mules” appear now 
and again.
 
A dragon crossbreed has all the game abilities of one 
or the other parent, rather than a mix. For instance, the 
offspring of a blue dragon and green dragon would, in 
terms of statistics and abilities, be either a blue or green 
dragon.
 
In terms of appearance, however, mixed breeds vary 
dramatically. Some are indistinguishable from normal 
dragon varieties. (This fact can lead to confusion when a 
dragon has all the abilities of one parent and looks like 
the other.) Others present a mix of traits. The aforemen-
tioned blue-green mix might have the shorter neck and 
heavy horn of the blue dragon and the general body type 
and spiked “crown” of the green. Its scales might grow in 
a pattern of blues and greens or take on a more uniform 
hue such as teal. A mixed-breed dragon has the life cycle 
and life span of the shorter-lived of its parents.
 
Many a sage or adventurer has identified what he 
thought to be a new dragon variety, when in fact it was an 
unusual mixed-breed. Feel free to throw one against your 
players and let them make the same mistake.

Elder dragons lay eggs less often than adults do 
but treat them with the same care. Ancient dragons 
almost never produce offspring, but those that do are 
highly protective—more so even than adults.
 
A few chromatic dragon varieties are monoga-
mous, mating with the same partner every cycle. 
Greens, blues, and browns often display this behavior. 
Other chromatics have multiple partners throughout 
their lives and retain little emotional attachment to 
former mates.
 
Both male and female dragons become fertile 
roughly halfway through the young stage of life and 
remain so until well into their ancient years. The urge 
to mate emerges at roughly the same time that fertil-
ity takes hold, grows to its height during the early 
adult stage, and fades—sometimes slightly, sometimes 
to nothing—at the late elder or early ancient stage.
Eggs
Dragons lay eggs in small clutches, the exact 
number varying according to the kind of dragon. 
Females can lay eggs as often as once per year but 
rarely do so that frequently. Dragons have a greater 
degree of influence over their own reproductive 
systems than humanoids do. Although a female 
dragon cannot completely control whether or not 
mating produces fertile eggs, the chance of fertiliza-
tion falls dramatically if the dragon does not wish to 
reproduce.
 
One of the parents—usually the female—typically 
locates the nest deep in the lair. The nest consists of 
a mound or pit where the parent gathers the eggs 
and buries them in sand, dirt, snow, leaves, or what-
ever medium is best suited to the dragon and to the 
environment.
 
The average dragon egg is about the size of a small 
rain barrel. Eggs normally have the same color as the 
dragon variety, though somewhat duller in hue. They 
are roughly ovoid and have a texture somewhere 
between dragon scale and stone.
 
When first laid, a dragon egg has resistance to 
the damage type produced by the parents’ breath 
weapon (acid for black dragons, fire for red, and so 
on). (Mixed breed dragon eggs have resistance to one 
parent’s damage type, and don’t survive if the other 
parent is incautious with his or her breath.) As the 
egg nears hatching, the shell grows harder but more 
brittle, and that resistance diminishes. By the time 
the wyrmling is ready to hatch, the egg has no resis-
tance at all.
 
Incubation time varies according to the variety of 
dragon. In all cases, the eggs are fertilized inside the 
female and are ready for laying roughly one-quarter 
of the way through the incubation period.
Hatching
When a wyrmling is ready to hatch, it begins feeding 
on the inside of the egg’s shell, absorbing the remain-
ing nutrients. This activity strengthens the young 
dragon and weakens the shell. The wyrmling then 
breaks free by clawing at the sides, pressing against 
and cracking the shell with brute strength, and 
blasting the shell occasionally with its own already 
developed breath weapon.
Wyrmling
A newly hatched dragon has a full array of abili-
ties. Although inferior to those of a young dragon, 
these abilities are sufficient for the wyrmling to take 
care of itself, at least against relatively weak threats 
and predators. Although an emerging wyrmling is 
sodden and somewhat awkward, it can run within 
hours of hatching and can fly within a day or two. 
A wyrmling’s senses are fully acute, and—due to the 
interweaving of a dragon’s centers of memory and 
instinct—it is born with a substantial amount of its 
parents’ knowledge imprinted in its mind.
 
Even so, a dragon is not born with the full memo-
ries of prior generations. Rather, a wyrmling has a 
grasp of the generalities of the world and of its own 
identity. It knows how to move, how to use its innate 
abilities, who and what its parents are, and—perhaps 
DRAGON EGG SPECIFICS
An average dragon egg is 4 feet long and slightly more 
than 2 feet wide at its widest. It weighs 50 to 70 pounds. 
If attacked, it has a break DC of 15; if the hatchling is 
viable, use wyrmling statistics for eggs broken early.
 
When first laid (at the end of the first quarter of the 
incubation period), an egg has resist 30 against the 
damage type of the parent’s breath weapon. This resis-
tance drops to 20 halfway through the incubation period, 
10 at the three-quarters mark, and 0 at hatching time.

most important—how to view the world around it. 
This awareness is one reason that even the young-
est dragons are capable of surviving to adulthood. It 
is also why a sense of superiority and arrogance is 
ubiquitous among chromatic dragons: They are born 
already knowing that they’re among the most power-
ful creatures in the world (or at least will be, after 
they mature).
 
Parents might accompany a wyrmling on its earli-
est hunts, to protect it and to make certain it knows 
how to hunt efficiently. Wyrmlings left to fend for 
themselves and wyrmlings that don’t have protective 
parents still must leave the nest within a few days of 
hatching to find food. By the third or fourth foray, 
even solicitous dragon parents let wyrmlings hunt on 
their own, lest the wyrmlings grow too dependent on 
parental assistance.
 
Wyrmlings spend a few years dwelling with one 
or both of their parents. Some parents welcome 
this time as an opportunity to teach their offspring 
lessons beyond its inherited knowledge: the best 
areas to hunt, what to look for in a lair, how to begin 
building a hoard, and other knowledge a growing 
dragon needs to gain. Other parents look on wyrm-
lings as necessary evils: competitors for resources 
and for space in the lair that must nevertheless be 
tolerated for a brief time. Only evil dragons that 
lack any parenting instinct—in dragonkind, a mild 
form of insanity—consider forcing a wyrmling to 
leave the nest early. This condition is most common 
in black and gray dragons but rare even among 
them.
 
A wyrmling whose parents abandoned it before it 
hatched or could not care for it after it hatched takes 
longer to hone its abilities. It still has the advantage 
of its inherited instincts, but the lack of a teacher 
makes perfecting its abilities an arduous task. Some 
wyrmlings manage to do so on their own, through 
trial and error. Others seek out mentors of their own 
kind. Even an evil dragon might willingly take on a 
short-term apprentice if the younger dragon shows 
adequate respect, such as gifts of treasure scav-
enged or stolen from any source the young dragon 
can manage. These relationships rarely last more 
than a few months, because the older dragon inevi-
tably begins to view the younger one as a rival. The 
younger dragon either departs or ends up on the 
menu.
 
Although wyrmlings are small and weak by 
dragon standards, a wyrmling is roughly the size 
of a large wolf or a full-grown human. Even at their 
youngest, dragons have few natural predators. For full 
statistics on chromatic dragon wyrmlings, see pages 
179–186.
Young
By the time a wyrmling becomes a young dragon, 
it has grown to roughly the size of a horse, and its 
hoarding, lairing, and territorial instincts are stoked 
into a raging fire. A young dragon must leave the nest 
(if it has not already done so) before territoriality and 
greed transform the parent–child relationship into a 
bitter rivalry.
 
The relationship between a dragon and its full-
grown offspring depends on the individuals in 
question. For the most part, dragon parents and 
children retain a loving relationship; though they do 
not share territories, they harbor affection for each 
other and render assistance if the other is in danger. 
A rare few go the opposite route, treating their par-
ents or offspring as competitors for resources—highly 
dangerous competitors, since each knows the other 
so well—and end up violently at odds. The majority of 
chromatic dragons fall between the two extremes: A 
vague fondness exists between parents and offspring, 
but neither is likely to jump into action if the other 
needs help. They react to any intrusion with as much 
violence as they would if the invader were a stranger.
 
The first task of a young dragon is to find a lair of 
its own. This task can prove challenging, because the 
territory the dragon knows belongs to either a parent 
or a mentor. Thus, a young dragon must depart the 
region it knows best to find a spot isolated enough to 
serve as a lair, yet still near enough to viable hunting 
grounds to make foraging possible.
 
Young dragons use existing structures (such as 
abandoned castles or mines) or natural hollows (such 
as caves) for their lairs. Later in life, when a dragon 
has more power, knowledge, and confidence, it might 
build, or find others to build, a better home. At the 
young stage, though, it just needs to find something 
viable.
 
A young dragon also starts to build its hoard. Drag-
ons of this age are likely to attack random travelers 
or caravans, scrounging whatever wealth they can 
acquire by using such an unsophisticated approach. 
As dragons grow older, they grow wiser and more 
selective, but a young dragon just wants to start accu-
mulating treasure.
Adult
Adult dragons revel in the fact that they are among 
the mightiest predators in existence, particularly 
if they have had a successful youth. When seeking 
to add to their hoards, they are more selective in 
their targets than younger wyrms, preferring not 
to waste their time with travelers or caravans that 
look unlikely to provide a decent amount of wealth—
though they might still attack such groups for food or 
sport.

16
C H A P T E R  1  |  D ra g o n  L o re
 
Also at this age, dragons begin to contemplate 
long-term schemes. Although they devote less time to 
scheming than elder dragons do, they might establish 
contacts within nearby communities or merchant 
organizations, the better to learn when and where 
great treasures will become available. Their negotiat-
ing strategies boil down to bribery or threats, rather 
than the elaborate manipulations and deceptions 
employed by more powerful wyrms.
 
Adult dragons seek to expand their territories 
dramatically or even to move their lairs, abandon-
ing whatever haphazard sanctuary they might have 
found as youths in favor of larger, more comfortable, 
or even custom-built homes. These efforts sometimes 
pit them against other dragons or territorial monsters. 
Thus, adult dragons are the most likely to initiate 
combat with other wyrms.
Elder
By the time it becomes an elder, a dragon has likely 
found or created its permanent lair. It has gathered a 
sizable hoard—one that might already have attracted 
a number of adventurers—and it has well and truly 
established its territory. Although a few elder dragons 
continue to expand their domains, most are content 
with their holdings (barring environmental changes 
or famine) and are more likely to be the defender 
against encroaching younger dragons than they are to 
initiate such conflicts.
 
Elder dragons have lived long enough that they 
have fully adopted the long view in terms of their 
goals and efforts. They have gathered minions—
sometimes veritable armies of them—and know well 
the sizes and capabilities of all the humanoid com-
munities within, and bordering on, their territories. 
They might make efforts to influence the develop-
ment of said communities, either overtly—through 
threats and demands—or in secret, manipulating 
agents within the local power structure. When 
adventurers discover that the king’s vizier, the high 
priest, and the local guild-masters are all puppets 
of a dragon pulling strings behind the scenes, odds 
are good that the dragon is an elder. Some dragons 
engage in such manipulative practices to siphon off 
the wealth of a city or small kingdom; some do it 
out of desire for power and authority; some are just 
bored.
Ancient
By the time it becomes ancient, a dragon ranks 
among the most powerful creatures to walk the earth. 
Its lair is nigh impregnable. Its hoard contains more 
wealth than any kingdom since the fall of the great 
empires. Its name (or at least one of them) is known 
far and wide among dragons and humanoids both. 
The dragon has survived longer than most nations.
 
The truth is, the dragon doesn’t have much left to 
do. The dragon’s territory is as large as the dragon 
wants it to be. If the dragon wants to manipulate 
and control the nearby communities, it does so. Few 
rivals exist with sufficient power to offer the dragon 
anything resembling sport. For an ancient dragon, 
perhaps the greatest challenge is staving off ennui.
 
Some ancients spend years hibernating or count-
ing and recounting their hoards, for lack of anything 
better to do. Others ignite conflict, invading other 
dragons’ territories or inspiring mortal allies to go to 
war, in hopes of finding a challenge to pass the time. 
A few revert to behaviors of younger dragons, hunting 
and raiding at whim. Some devote themselves fanati-
cally to whatever religious beliefs they hold, or seek 
out new ones.
 
Others take on strange or surprising hobbies, pass-
ing the years by studying select periods in history, 
mastering rituals, or researching other planes. When 
adventurers hear about a dragon seeking an ancient 
ritual or kidnapping a sage and stealing his library, 
the dragon might be an ancient seeking a new area of 
interest.
Twilight
Even dragons eventually succumb to the ravages of 
age. As death approaches, the wyrm enters a state 
known to sages as “the twilight.” (What the dragons 
call this period, if anything, is unknown.) Although 
the average age of a twilight dragon is within a couple 
of decades of maximum age, some dragons enter the 
twilight more than a century earlier. Others enter 
twilight only in the last few years of life. Some never 
enter twilight, going overnight from full, ancient 
health to death of old age.
 
Twilight is the only time during a dragon’s life 
span when the creature grows weaker rather than 
stronger. Precisely how this weakening develops dif-
fers from dragon to dragon and appears to have no 
correlation with the dragon’s variety. For DMs who 
wish to run a dragon in its twilight years, consider 
one or more of the following options, or make up your 
own.
✦ The dragon grows less viable in all respects. Use 
the rules on page 174 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide
(“Increasing or Decreasing Level”) to lower the 
dragon’s level by one to three.
✦ The dragon finds it harder to recharge its abilities. 
Choose either the breath weapon or another ability 
that recharges on a d6 roll, and treat it as a once-
per-encounter ability instead.
✦ The dragon’s senses begin to fail. It takes a pen-
alty of –2 to –10 to Perception checks and Insight 
checks, and –1 to –5 to initiative checks.

LIFE CYCLE
Death
The mighty dragons, despite all their power, are 
still mortal. With the exception of those who extend 
their existence by unnatural means, such as the vile 
draco liches, death eventually comes to them all. Most 
chromatic dragons die in battle—defending their ter-
ritory from rivals, invading other wyrms’ territories, 
or falling victim to the business ends of adventuring 
parties’ swords and spells.
 
Chromatics who reach the end of old age find 
themselves in a quandary. Although some dragon 
varieties, such as certain metallics, can will them-
selves to die, chromatic dragons cannot. Thus, those 
powerful or lucky enough to reach old age face the 
slow decline into twilight, further weakening, and, 
eventually, death.
 
Most chromatic dragons do not desire a gradual 
decline, instead choosing to go out in the proverbial 
blaze of glory. They invade other dragons’ territories, 
particularly those of lifelong rivals, prepared to end it 
all in a final, calamitous clash of fire and claw. Others 
raze entire communities, challenging the greatest 
humanoid heroes to face them. Invariably, a dragon 
with a death wish finds someone or something 
capable of killing it—but the amount of destruction 
it can wreak in the process is on par with the worst 
of natural disasters. A single ancient dragon with 
nothing to lose and no concern for consequences or 
self-preservation can decimate kingdoms or render 
entire regions uninhabitable.
 
Dragons setting out on these crusades for glory 
might consume their entire hoard before doing so. 
They find the notion of leaving all their hard-earned 
wealth for thieves utterly anathema.
 
A few particularly religious dragons choose more 
devotional routes. Some draconic sects set areas aside 
where ancient dragons can lie down and die peace-
fully, perhaps euthanized by their fellow believers. 
These areas lead to tales of dragons’ graveyards.
 
Other dragons seek out plane-traveling rituals, 
attempt to find the astral domain of their patron 
deity (usually Tiamat, among chromatic dragons), 
and disappear from the mortal world. What happens 
to them when they arrive there is unknown even to 
other dragons.
Environmental Diffusion
One of the strangest aspects of a dragon’s mystical, 
elemental nature sometimes comes into play after 
death. Most dead dragons decay into bones and dust 
over the course of years. On occasion, however, the 
energy flowing through the dragon’s heart and blood 
diffuses into the surrounding region, creating an area 
of environmental chaos.
 
This phenomenon happens most often with 
ancient dragons, very rarely with elders and adults, 
and almost never in young dragons—but within those 
categories, there appears to be no way to predict 
which dragons will decompose in this way. Even 
among the ancients, fewer than 20 percent experi-
ence environmental diffusion.
 
When environmental diffusion occurs, the drag-
on’s entire body decays into nothingness relatively 
quickly: over the course of a few months. The sur-
rounding area becomes inundated with the dragon’s 
internal energy, resulting in a permanent (or at least 
extremely long-lasting) environmental shift. The area 
averages a radius of about 100 squares (500 feet) per 
level of the deceased dragon.
 
The nature of the environmental change depends 
on the dragon. In the case of blue dragons, for 
instance, the area becomes the center of a permanent 
storm, one that rages and thunders regardless of pre-
dominant weather patterns. For a list of the effects 
that emanate from the different dragon varieties, see 
“Chromatic Dragons in Detail” on page 30.
 
In draconic tradition, a dragon that locates an 
area of elemental diffusion left by a wyrm of its own 
variety considers such a discovery an omen of luck. 
Dragons that find such areas normally attempt to 
make lairs within.

The true secret to understanding dragons—whether 
running them as the DM or combating them as a 
player—is in comprehending their worldview. Master-
ing knowledge of their physical abilities is a start, but 
it’s all too easy for a human to assume that because 
dragons are intelligent mortal creatures, they must 
think like humans do. Dragons are at least as dif-
ferent from other creatures in their psychology and 
thought processes as they are physically.
Arrogance and 
Superiority
Dragons are superior beings: more powerful, more 
intelligent, more worthy of wealth and territory, and 
more important than any other mortal creature. To 
them, this conviction is more than a dogmatic belief; 
it’s a fundamental fact, something they are born 
knowing, and a cornerstone of their personality and 
worldview. This aspect makes dragons seem arro-
gant when they interact with humanoids, but it goes 
beyond any human conception of conceit. To try to 
humble a dragon is like trying to talk the wind out of 
blowing or attempting to persuade a starving person 
not to die of deprivation.
 
This attitude colors just about everything a dragon 
does. Chromatic dragons think of humanoids in 
exactly the same way humanoids think of animals—
as prey or as beasts of burden, subject to dragons’ 
whims. More benevolent dragons treat humanoids 
with kindness, just as good-hearted humans would 
not unnecessarily hurt animals—but ultimately, 
humanoids are still lesser creatures. Even a nonevil 
chromatic dragon thinks little of taking something 
that belongs to humans or elves, or even of eating the 
occasional passerby. That is the natural order.
 
Dragons can, however, recognize the capabilities 
of powerful individuals or of people in great numbers. 
Arrogant though they are, dragons will negotiate with 
humanoids if they feel such folk pose a danger or 
have something to offer that the dragon cannot easily 
acquire on its own. Even then, though, the dragon 
measures and values the people in question based 
solely on their threat or usefulness and not on any 
intrinsic worth. The dragon assumes the position of 
authority in any such interaction, not as a conscious 
or deliberate choice, but because—as far as the dragon 
is concerned—that is the way the world works.
 
The situation grows more complicated when drag-
ons apply this same attitude toward other dragons. 
Chromatics believe that all dragons are superior to 
other creatures, that chromatic dragons are superior 
to nonchromatics, that their own variety is superior 
to other chromatic varieties, and—usually—that each 
individual chromatic dragon is superior to all other 
dragons of their kind. Even as they acknowledge that 
older dragons are more powerful than they are, they 
believe that they themselves will become more potent 
by that age. To say that a chromatic dragon literally 
believes that the world revolves around it is not ter-
ribly far from the truth. This innate arrogance, more 
than greed or ambition, leads to dragon-versus-dragon 
conflicts over prey, territory, or magic items. Even 
when dragons band together to cooperate in family 
groups or in the occasional community, each dragon 
feels that it ought to be the one running things. A 
dragon might be capable of temporarily squelching 
that impulse for the greater good, but it remains pres-
ent in the back of the dragon’s mind nonetheless.
 
A few nonevil chromatics go the opposite way in 
their arrogance, seeing humanoids not as beasts to be 
exploited but as poor, defenseless children (or even 
pets) to protect and herd. Although such dragons 
pose less physical danger to humanoid communities 
than others, they can be just as difficult to deal with. 
They speak condescendingly, assuming they know 
what is best for their chosen wards regardless of 
what the people themselves think. Such dragons are 
stifling at best and dictatorial at worst, usurping the 
rules of communities purportedly for their own good.
Drives
Dragons do not share humanoid drives, such as 
the needs for comfort and companionship. Even 
basic drives of life—food, shelter, and reproduction—
common to both dragons and humanoids manifest 
themselves in different ways.
 
A dragon is a long-distance hunter, willing and 
able to cover dozens of miles for a single meal. Thus, 
it does not share the human need to gather with 
others around convenient sources of food or water. 
Further, whereas humanoids seek safety in numbers, 
a dragon feels safest in isolation.
 
Most humanoids are gregarious creatures. They 
gather not just for food or protection, but also because 
they are happiest when able to interact with others. 
They talk; they form friendships; they work together. 
Dragons, on the other hand, rarely seek companion-
ship of any sort. Most of them happily spend the 
majority of their lives in solitude. They might visit 
other dragons once every few years, for conversation 
or to learn of world events. When the mating urge 
takes them, they seek out companions with whom 
they might spend several years while raising wyrm-
lings. With a few exceptions, however, even a loving, 
monogamous dragon couple spends only a few years 
together every few decades. With too much time 
together, dragons’ territorial instincts kick in, making

WARREN MAHY
OUTLOOK AND PSYCHOLOGY
them uncomfortable around one another. An ancient 
dragon proverb about mated pairs translates roughly 
as, “Love is best fed by borders.”
 
Combine the preference for isolation with innate 
territorial instincts, and it becomes easier to see why 
dragons have a difficult time understanding why 
human communities grow the way they do. When 
a dragon objects to a humanoid village growing into 
its territory, it might not comprehend why the people 
cannot move to a different location, or why the village 
must have so many of them.
 
Similarly, dragons do not recognize how relatively 
fragile humanoids are. They know themselves to 
be physically superior, but they might not know the 
extent to which this is the case.
 
Dragons and humanoids share the basic drive 
to find shelter—preferably a permanent home. For 
humanoids, this includes a predilection for comfort. 
Dragons, with their innate toughness, weak tactile 
senses, and great tolerance for temperature fluctua-
tion, rarely experience true discomfort. Temperature 
bothers them only if it sinks or climbs to extremes 
(and, depending on the dragon’s variety, sometimes not 
even then). Also, a dragon’s ability to fly renders terrain 
all but a moot point. Thus, just as dragons might fail to 
grasp why humanoids gather in great numbers, they 
also sometimes fail to understand why humanoids are 
so picky about where they choose to live. The notion 
that one region might be more comfortable than 
another region with similar resources might never 
occur to a dragon—certainly not to the extent that com-
fort would justify choosing a region inside the dragon’s 
territory over another region outside it.
The Hoard
If dragons are known for any attitude beyond all 
others—above even arrogance—it’s greed. Even the 
friendliest of good dragons is as avaricious as the 
stingiest human miser. Dragon hoards are legendary: 
enormous piles of gold, gleaming gems, magic items—
wealth enough to buy and sell entire humanoid 
communities. Yet dragons rarely do anything with all 
that wealth. They collect not to spend, but to have.
 
The desire to build a hoard is a psychological 
drive—even, arguably, a biological drive—in chromatic 
dragons. It is no less pressing than the human need for 
companionship or shelter. It has no discernable practi-
cal reason, no underlying purpose, no goal. Although 
the occasional dragon might fight the urge to hoard 
just as the occasional human prefers to be a hermit, it 
is a trait to which the race as a whole succumbs.

20
C H A P T E R  1  |  D ra g o n  L o re
ERIC DESCHAMPS
 
As to where this drive might come from, no one 
can say for certain. Dragons that care enough to 
analyze the trait assume that either Tiamat gifted it 
to the race—a reflection of her own covetousness—
or it evolved naturally. Perhaps the earliest dragons 
impressed potential mates with their hoards, so that 
the dragons with the largest hoards passed their 
attitudes and instincts to their offspring. Dragons 
wonder no more about the origins of their avaricious-
ness than they wonder why they have a breath weapon 
or wings; they accept it as the natural way of things.
Lack of Societal Norms 
and Pressure
A relatively minor aspect of dragon psychology, 
yet nonetheless important for understanding the 
creatures, is the almost complete lack of societal pres-
sures. Societal norms shape humanoid civilization 
in every respect. Laws and taboos, traditions and 
beliefs, are all largely social constructs. If a human 
chooses not to steal property from a neighbor for fear 
of punishment, or if a dwarf refrains from murdering 
a member of a rival clan to avoid retaliation, societal 
constraints are at work. Notions of marriage, rules 
about acceptable times for sexual relations, courtesy, 
economic transactions, work ethics—the rules of soci-
ety shape and define all these customs and more.
 
Dragons do not have such pressures. They have 
traditions, but the average dragon has no peer pres-
sure or governing body pushing it to follow those 
traditions. It follows traditions—or chooses not to—
based entirely on personal beliefs. Except in rarely 
occurring draconic societies, dragons have no laws 
prohibiting specific behaviors. Dragons might 
observe religious prohibitions, but they do so on an 
individual basis and might or might not follow such 
rules consistently.
 
Intellectually, a dragon might understand—or 
at least learn—why humanoids undertake or avoid 
certain behaviors when law or tradition demands it. 
The notion that a body of laws might shape a com-
munity’s behavior rarely, if ever, occurs to a dragon 
at the outset; humanoids must explain that concept, 
unless the dragon has dealt with humanoids before. 
Even if a dragon does have experience in dealing with 
humanoids, it does not comprehend how powerful a 
force societal and peer pressure can be, since it has 
probably never experienced such a thing. When told 
that a specific humanoid cannot undertake an action 
because the action is illegal or taboo, a dragon’s first 
reaction is likely to amount to, “So what?”
 
Despite their isolationist natures, however, drag-
ons do occasionally form larger communities. Such 
dragons are far more likely than others to understand 
and to accept the restrictions that society places on 
humanoids.
Patience and 
the Long View
It’s easy enough to speak of the passage of thousands of 
years, but the true significance of a dragon’s life span 
takes some consideration to process. Thousands of years. 
Multiple millennia. The average dragon can expect to 
live longer than most nations and many religions.
 
Dragons, in other words, have a lot of time on their 
hands.
 
In emergencies, dragons can react swiftly, making 
decisions on the spur of the moment and dealing 
with immediate needs. Barring such urgency, drag-
ons have no desire to seize the moment. It does not 
even occur to them to do so. Dragons take their time 
mulling over even the simplest of decisions, consider-
ing the possible repercussions and contemplating all 
possible options.
 
When trying to negotiate with a dragon, even the 
most patient negotiator can lose faith. If a dragon 
cannot come to an agreement—and assuming the 
issue is not one over which the dragon would kill—it 
can happily walk away from the table and come back 
to negotiate with the heirs of the original envoy. More 
than once, a dragon that has held successful interac-
tions with a given person comes back to talk to him or 
her later, only to be surprised to learn that the person 
has been dead for several generations.
 
As discussed previously, the long life span contrib-
utes more than anything else to a dragon’s arrogance 
and superiority. Consider that a dragon’s view of the 
human life span roughly compares to a human’s view 
of a gerbil’s longevity. A humanoid generation can 

21
C H A P T E R  1  |  D ra g o n  L o re
SOCIETY
pass in the time it takes a dragon to mull over a single 
problem; a dragon can wake from a long sleep to find 
entire empires have risen and fallen in its absence. 
Is it any wonder, then, that dragons cannot find it 
in themselves to lend weight or importance to the 
actions and desires of scurrying humanoids?
 
Unfortunately for humanoids, a dragon’s grudges 
live as long as the dragon. Because an angered dragon 
holds individual humanoids in such little esteem, it 
does not particularly concern itself with enacting its 
vengeance upon the specific person who angered 
it. Dragons have been known to return generations 
after humanoids insulted or defeated them, wreaking 
destruction upon those humanoids’ descendants or 
hometown. In such cases, the victims of the wyrm’s 
rage might not even remember the individual who 
angered the dragon, let alone the specifics of the insult.
 
A dragon’s long life span is not always a blessing. 
Although dragons lack the humanoid need for mental 
and physical stimulation, even dragons grow bored 
with the passage of decades and centuries. Many drag-
ons study and master mystic rituals, not just for the 
power they offer but also for the mental exercise. As 
suggested in the discussion of ancient dragons (page 
16), some solve riddles or puzzles, study history or 
religion, or even deliberately instigate conflicts to keep 
themselves amused. Dragons might become experts 
in multiple fields, not out of any real desire to master 
those subjects, but as a means of passing time. Some 
turn to religion, following various rites and celebrations 
more as a hobby than as a sign of true religious faith.
Predatory Instincts
Perhaps one of the single greatest differences 
between dragons and humans, in terms of thought 
processes, is this: Dragons are predators. A dragon 
might be a sage, a priest, a connoisseur of art, a col-
lector of treasure, or even an ambitious politician, 
but these are secondary identifiers. A dragon is a 
hunter who possesses other interests, not a collector 
or a leader who happens to hunt. Barring such factors 
as speech and intelligence, dragons are less akin to 
humans than they are to wolves, tigers, or snakes.
 
Everything discussed so far, every draconic action 
or personality quirk, comes about at least in part from 
dragons’ predatory nature. A dragon chooses the loca-
tion for a lair not just defensively, but also to ensure 
a rich hunting ground. Because of its arrogance, a 
dragon sees humanoids and other beings not merely 
as lesser creatures, but as potential prey. Even a 
dragon’s acquisition of a hoard requires it to hone its 
hunting and combat abilities: it must locate, obtain, 
and defend its possessions.
 
When negotiating with humanoids, a dragon not 
only has the upper hand in dealing with a lesser 
being, but it is also interacting with something that, 
under other circumstances, would be lunch. Indeed, 
the option of eating an envoy and starting over with 
someone else rarely strays far from a dragon’s mind. 
When a dragon deigns to negotiate with humanoids, it 
expects the humanoids to be grateful; it has, after all, 
already done them the favor of allowing them to live.
SOCIETY
The short view of dragon society is this: By and large, 
no such thing exists.
 
Exceptions here and there have turned up 
throughout history as, on occasion, dragons have 
sought either to build their own societies or to insinu-
ate themselves into the cultures of others. For the 
most part, however, dragons’ solitary and territorial 
nature ensures that they eschew societal bonds.
 
Under most circumstances, what passes for society 
among chromatic dragons best falls under the label 
“infrequent.” So-called dragon society consists of 
occasional cooperation between a handful of drag-
ons against a larger threat, adherence to occasional 
common religious practices, and the occasional 
observance of vague and ineffectual traditions gov-
erning interaction between dragons when interests or 
territories overlap.
Interaction 
between Dragons
When chromatic dragons interact with each 
other, the meeting comes about because one has 
encroached on another’s territory or because mul-
tiple dragons have their eyes a single prize, such as 
a particularly well-located lair, a valuable item, or 
a holy relic of Tiamat. Sages estimate that the size 
of a dragon’s territory encompasses all the ground 
that dragon can cover in one day’s flight from its lair. 
Although that serves as a basis, dragons might claim 
significantly less territory than that if they have plen-
tiful hunting closer to their lair, and others claim 
lands farther out, either because they cannot find or 
build lairs near good hunting grounds or because of 
their pride and greed.
Interaction with 
Other Chromatics
Chromatic dragons come into conflict with one 
another for a variety of reasons. Although dragons 
accept a tiny amount of overlap between territories 
(albeit reluctantly) if the two dragons are of the same 
variety, territorial overlap of more than a sliver of 
shared space or between dragons of different hues 
leads to confrontation.
 
Geographical disputes between dragons can 
become bloody. In most cases, one dragon or the other 
could depart to find hunting grounds elsewhere, but

DEVON CADDY-LEE
these prideful, territorial creatures never give in with-
out a fight unless one wyrm is clearly older and more 
powerful than the other.
 
More such clashes occur over dragons’ hoards. 
Every dragon knows that the best place to acquire a lot 
of wealth quickly is from the lair of another dragon. 
Although a few chromatics respect their neighbors’ 
domains and would never contemplate such a raid, 
the majority leap at the chance if they think they 
stand better-than-average chances of success.
 
Other, less common reasons for conflict exist as well. 
Chromatic dragons war over mates, religious differ-
ences, specific treasures, and insults real or imagined.
 
When hostile dragons come together, the conflict 
can take one of two forms. If combat is not a foregone 
conclusion, the dragons spend minutes—sometimes 
even hours—circling one another, taking each other’s 
measure, and perhaps bellowing at one another 
across the intervening distance. (Usually these 
bellows consist of threats and braggadocio, but occa-
sionally two chromatics discuss and resolve a point of 
contention in this way.) If one realizes that it cannot 
prevail in the conflict, it breaks off the engagement 
and retreats, essentially ceding victory.
 
If the two find themselves evenly matched, and 
the shouting back and forth does not result in nego-
tiation, the result is a sudden fury of blood and claw, 
breath weapon and fang.
 
The usual such battle ends with a clear victor: the 
dragon that survives. In some instances, however, 
the loser escapes, with the winner too exhausted 
or injured to pursue. In other cases, no clear victor 
emerges, and the dragons break off combat when 
both are too bloodied and exhausted to continue. 
When this happens, it can mark the start of a long-
term rivalry, a grudge match that might be carried 
out in skirmishes between minions, sabotage, and 
espionage that can last for centuries.
 
Still, not all interaction between chromatic drag-
ons leads to conflict. Some dragons band together, 
despite the racial predilection for solitude. Most 
such gatherings are familial, but even groups of 
dragons without bonds of blood can find common 
cause. Chromatic dragons might band together to 
face encroaching dragons more powerful than any 
of them as individuals, or they might join forces to 
take revenge on legendary dragonslayers. They might 
come together for religious reasons, honoring Tiamat 
or another deity, or they might undertake quests in 
Tiamat’s name. As mentioned previously, a wyrmling 
without a parent might enter into a master-apprentice 
relationship with an elder dragon of the same variety. 
Finally, sometimes two chromatic dragons meet to 
trade information—perhaps on the borders of neigh-
boring but not overlapping territories—realizing that 
as long as they keep off of each other’s lands, they 

23
C H A P T E R  1  |  D ra g o n  L o re
SOCIETY
have more to gain through exchange and mutual 
defense than they do through combat.
Interaction with 
Metallic Dragons
Take everything described above about chromatic 
dragons’ interactions with other chromatics, and 
remove any hint of their working together or respect-
ing common boundaries. That is how chromatic 
dragons interact with their metallic cousins.
 
By and large, chromatic dragons see metallic drag-
ons as born rivals, an inferior species of dragon whose 
existence is an insult that cannot be tolerated. Devout 
worshipers of Tiamat particularly think this way, 
desiring to purge metallic dragons, the children of 
Bahamut, from the face of the world. Any interaction 
between such chromatics and metallics ends, if not in 
combat, at least in threats and promises of violence to 
come. Cooperation and collaboration do not exist.
 
As with all things, exceptions do exist. Some chro-
matic dragons have better things to do than engage 
in battle after battle with other dragons. Chromatics 
might be cowed into cooperation, or at least peaceful 
coexistence, by the greater power of a neighboring 
metallic dragon. In such cases, metallic and chro-
matic dragons can both occupy territories in a given 
region. Tales even tell of forbidden love between chro-
matic and metallic dragons, or of the two kinds of 
dragons finding common ground in a religious sect—
but even if true, such tales are so rare as to be legend.
Interaction with 
Other Dragons
Chromatic dragons feel uncertainty about the nature 
of the powerful and deadly catastrophic and scourge 
dragons. Greed and ambition drive the rages, vio-
lence, and destruction of chromatic dragons. With a 
few exceptions, even the most rapacious red or black 
dragons do not understand the mind-sets of creatures 
that cause death and devastation without a care for 
what they gain in the process—yet that’s exactly what 
they believe catastrophic and scourge dragons to do. 
Thus, chromatic dragons engage these other wyrms 
in battle only when necessary, due to territorial dis-
putes or conflicts over treasure, and otherwise prefer 
to ignore their existence.
 
Chromatic dragons regard planar dragons as part 
of the extended family, at least those descended from 
chromatics. Thus, planar dragons and chromatic 
dragons get along as well or as poorly as any two 
kinds of chromatics.
Societal Traits
The previous section contained a number of general-
izations: Most dragons prefer isolation. For the most part, 
dragons don’t form or join societies. Nevertheless, a few 
chromatics make efforts to join or establish extended 
networks or societies. When draconic societies do 
arise, they normally take one of the following forms.
Family and Clan
The least rare of the chromatic dragon societies is 
more of an extended family than a society. Although 
most mated pairs separate when wyrmlings depart 
the nest, a few families stay together, either because 
the region is particularly dangerous and they wish to 
protect their offspring, or because they seek to estab-
lish a power base for a religious or political purpose. 
As these families expand, they occasionally grow 
into full-fledged clans. Each member, or at least each 
immediate family, claims its own domain, and the 
combined territories can exceed the size of nations. 
These clans might engage in internecine squabbles 
for power, but the clan leader is almost always the 
eldest—and thus, strongest—of the bloodline.
 
Few humanoids hear of these extended clans, at 
least by name, since the clan members interact with 
humanoids in the same manner that lone dragons 
do—as raiders and predators. One name that has 
appeared in humanoid records, however, is that of 
Irril-Indriss, an ancient blue dragon known to locals 
as the Thunder King. Irril-Indriss and his extended 
family, numbering roughly a dozen dragons, dwell in 
the peaks of the cloud-wrapped Achlan Mountains 
and use the region’s frequent storms as cover for raids 
against both the coastal highland communities and 
the merchant ships that ply nearby waters.
Mixed Societies
If the familial clan is the most common draconic 
society, the mixed community is the least common. 
In a mixed society, dragons and members of another 
kind or race—often a race associated with dragons—
work together for the common good, with both races 
participating fully in the government. Even if dragons 
hold all the highest positions, the other native races 
are full citizens: not slaves or subjects, but partners.
 
Dragons’ superiority makes these mixed societies 
not only rare to begin with, but also difficult to main-
tain. In order for such a community to last, either 
the dragons must have a strong sense of purpose and 
devotion to the society (one that allows them to over-
come their distaste for long-term cooperation with 
“lesser” beings) or the other race or races must prove 
themselves on a regular basis to convince even the 
most arrogant wyrm that they are worthy of the drag-
ons’ cooperation.
 
The dragonborn empire of Arkhosia is the iconic 
example of this sort of society. Although metallic 
dragons made up the primary dragon population 
of the empire, a significant minority of enlightened 
chromatic dragons were citizens as well. Alterna-
tively, for those familiar with the DRAGONLANCE®

series of novels, the armies of Takhisis—consisting of 
dragons, the humanoid Highlords, and the armies of 
humans, goblinoids, and draconians—also serves an 
excellent example of a mixed society, one driven and 
held together by religious zealotry.
Overlords
In this variety of chromatic dragon society, a ruling 
class or order of dragons reigns as tyrants over a 
population of other races. Unlike a mixed society, 
this is not a partnership. The people of the society 
are second-class citizens at best, slaves and chattel 
at worst, utterly subject to the whims of their dra-
conic masters.
 
The makeup of this government varies. In some 
cases, a single family, clan, or variety of chromatic 
dragon makes up the entirety of the ruling overclass. 
In others, the dragon lords might be of multiple chro-
matic varieties—but even then, one bloodline of one 
variety holds the pinnacle of power, above the other 
dragons. Some of these societies have a sort of middle 
class—individuals favored by the dragons, who stand 
above the rest of the populace but still do not rule. 
These individuals are usually either dragonborn or 
dragonspawn (see page 218).
 
Perhaps the most infamous historical example of 
a dragon overlord society is the nation of Maru-Qet, 
an empire ruled by a pharaonic dynasty of brown 
dragons until war with a clan of catastrophic dragons 
reduced it to a blistered wasteland. (See “Neferman-
dias” on page 240.) Less famous, but of far greater 
threat to the people of the modern day, is the city-
state of Pallavarthas. Due to a great ritual performed 
by exarchs of Tiamat, this doomed city exists on two 
planes at once: the natural world and Tiamat’s own 
astral domain. As the two dimensions merge within 
the city’s borders, more and more of its citizens find 
themselves suddenly in an alien world, pressed into 
slavery by dragonspawn overseers.
LANGUAGE
As one of the oldest living races native to the world, 
dragons speak one of the most ancient mortal lan-
guages. When the mortal races beheld the gods, 
each heard the divine Supernal language in its 
own unique fashion depending on its shape and 
demeanor. Thus the foundational languages of the 
world arose, including Draconic.
 
Io created the Draconic script, Iokharic, so his 
mortal children could record their impressions of 
the world he hoped they would inherit. Both the lan-
guage and the script survive to the present day.
 
Dragon-related races, including dragonborn and 
kobolds, also speak Draconic and use Iokharic. 
Some individuals among these races take great 
pride in their use of the same tongue that rumbles 
from the scaled lips of ancient wyrms, although 
others curse their lineage. Most, however, rarely 
give it a thought.

LANGUAGE
 
As with all languages, variations and dialects 
based on the order or race of the speaker abound 
within the Draconic tongue. Students of dialects can 
potentially discern a dragon’s variety, scales unseen. 
Though accents are sometimes thick, such variation 
rarely hampers communication. Languages derived 
from Supernal are robust enough to resist natural 
alternations that would render distant populations of 
speakers unintelligible to each other.
Language Details
The audible footprint of Draconic grates on the ears 
of other creatures and includes several hard conso-
nants and sibilants. It employs sounds that humans 
describe as hissing (sj, ss, and sv), as well as a noise 
that sounds like a beast clearing its throat (ach).
 
Draconic words have emphasis on the first sylla-
ble. Speakers of Draconic express important ideas by 
emphasizing the beginnings and the ends of words. 
Writers who use Iokharic mark important words with 
a special symbol of five lines radiating outward like 
the rays of a star or like the heads of Tiamat. Dragons 
might use this form of emphasis when referring to 
themselves, as well as when commanding, threaten-
ing, warning, or making a point.

Naming
Dragons have a long history of impressive, terrible 
names capable of generating fear when merely 
spoken. A dragon’s name has no intrinsic power (but 
see the “Optional Rule: Power in a Name” sidebar); 
rather, the dragon associated with a name is so fear-
some that any listener familiar with the dragon’s 
exploits might be stricken with associative fright. 
Listeners shudder when they hear of the exploits 
of Dragotha, the undead dragon. They cry out in 
amazement to learn of the dragon Ashardalon, who 
replaced his own heart with a demon heart. Who 
can forget Cyan Bloodbane, who nearly destroyed 
the ancient elven nation of Silvanesti on the world of 
Krynn?
 
Dragon names can do more than engender fear. 
They can also inspire dreams of valor. A wealth of 
myths, legends, and heroic stories name dragons 
defeated by brave knights, powerful wizards, and 
lucky or sly commoners. By their nature, dragons 
command attention when named. People throughout 
the world feel dragons’ actions, schemes, and even 
dreams. From a wyrmling named Aussir raiding 
sheep to mighty Ashardalon feasting on preincarnate 
souls, dragons’ names command attention. To many, 
such names embody the magic inherent in the world.
 
Dragons come from many different orders. Even 
within those groups of similar dragons, different 
naming conventions apply. Some dragons receive 
their names from their parents even before they 
hatch. Others name themselves only after living long 
enough to find a need for a name. Some dragons 
might receive names from other creatures that know 
of their exploits. A dragon might take a new name 
midway through its life, either to commemorate a 
great victory or to combat the ennui of a life that can 
stretch for a succession of centuries.
RELIGION
All dragons know of Io, who fashioned mortal drag-
ons in his image. They also know that Io died not long 
afterward. They believe that the other deities, who 
banded together during the primordial–deity wars 
that followed the creation of the world, left Io to fight 
alone except for the aid of his draconic children.
The Fall of Io
During the wars, Io faced a terrible primordial called 
Erek-Hus, the King of Terror, on a blasted worldly 
continent half shattered from a century of conflict. 
With a primordial-wrought axe of adamantine the 
size of a mountain, the King of Terror split Io from 
head to tail, neatly cleaving the deity into two pieces.
RELIGION
RELIGION
 
Erek-Hus laughed, his voice jubilant thunder that 
resounded across the face of the world. Before his 
laugh died away, the divine power released from Io’s 
split form entered Io’s two eldest children, transform-
ing them from dragons into deities.
Birth of the 
Dragon Deities
What one deity alone could not accomplish, two 
working together could. Together the two new dei-
ties, Bahamut and Tiamat, fought and killed the 
King of Terror. Bahamut flung the King’s axe into the 
starry sky.
 
The infusion of divine power granted more than 
just divine strength to Bahamut and Tiamat. Io’s 
character also split. His desire to protect creation 
and his sense of fairness took root in Bahamut, now 
worshiped as a deity of justice, honor, and protection. 
Tiamat embodied Io’s hubris, arrogance, and covet-
ousness and came to be revered as a deity of greed 
and envy.
 
The two dragon deities looked at each other across 
the corpse of the defeated King of Terror. Neither 
could suffer the other to exist.
 
They leapt for each other and battled for days. 
Finally, Tiamat fled, and the two deities returned 
their attention to the larger war against the 
primordials.
Worship by 
Chromatic Dragons
Uncountable millennia have passed since Bahamut 
and Tiamat rose. In that time, mortal dragons have 
multiplied across the world. Chromatic dragons 
openly prefer Tiamat, but other deities have also 
found dragons’ favor.
Asmodeus
Asmodeus is the evil deity of the Nine Hells. He 
is patron of the powerful, deity of tyranny and 
domination, and the commander of devils. Of all 
the chromatics, red dragons are the most likely to 
commit to the service of Asmodeus. A red dragon’s 
natural desire to tyrannize finds resonance in Asmo-
deus’s hierarchy of power and pain. What red dragon 
would overlook the chance to install devilish guard-
ians in its volcanic lair?
Avandra
The deity of change, Avandra delights in freedom, 
trade, travel, adventure, and the frontier. Many 
also see her as a patron deity of luck, the quality for 
which some chromatic dragons revere her—but only 
dragons that are not especially evil in behavior. Tia-
mat’s clergy reviles dragons that revere Avandra over 

27
C H A P T E R  1  |  D ra g o n  L o re
LEE MOYER
RELIGION
Tiamat, but Avandra’s draconic followers are nowhere 
as despised as the chromatics that follow Bahamut’s 
teachings.
Bahamut
Called the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut is the deity of 
justice, protection, nobility, and honor. Lawful good 
paladins often revere him, and metallic dragons 
worship him as the first of their kind. Of all the 
deities, Bahamut receives the least reverence 
from chromatics. Sometimes a chro-
matic might rebel against its inner 
nature, following Bahamut’s 
teachings as a new paradigm 
through which to live out the 
centuries. Bahamut offers guid-
ance to dragons that follow his 
path, because the church of 
Tiamat sends powerful clerics to 
destroy any chromatic dragon it 
learns has switched its devotion 
to the Platinum Dragon.
Bane
Bane is the deity of war and con-
quest. He commands his followers 
to overpower the weak, subjugate the 
survivors, and spread war everywhere. 
Though militaristic nations of humans 
and goblins serve him, many chromatics 
also warm to Bane’s message of perpetual 
conquest. With never-ending war comes the 
opportunity for never-ending pillage: Chromatics 
welcome the opportunity to profiteer, and they dra-
matically enhance the value of their hoards by taking 
advantage of and indeed even fomenting war. They 
break peace treaties and otherwise make certain 
that neighboring kingdoms live in armed fear of one 
another.
Corellon
The deity of spring, beauty, and the arts, Corellon 
is the patron of arcane magicians and the fey. Some 
believe he seeded the world with arcane magic, 
which is why chromatic dragons might come to 
revere this deity more often associated with eladrin 
and elves. Wily red dragons especially find the accu-
mulation of arcane knowledge a most important 
pursuit. Thus, they might keep shrines to Corellon 
in their lairs. Indeed, one of Corellon’s commands to 
his followers is to seek out lost magic items, forgotten 
rituals, and ancient works of art. What dragon does 
not already do that?
Erathis
Erathis is the deity of civilization, so her values 
oppose those of most chromatic dragons. As a founder 
of cities and writer of laws, Erathis creates order and 
organization among the helpless multitudes, whereas 
chromatics value the strength of the individual and 
the right of individuals (in other words, themselves) 
to do as they please. Erathis’s role as the muse of great 
inventors has called to a few blues, browns, and other 
individual dragons that value new ideas, but on the 
whole Erathis has few chromatic worshipers.
Gruumsh
Gruumsh is the chaotic evil deity of 
destruction, lord of marauding 
barbarian hordes. He exhorts his 
followers to slaughter and pil-
lage, a dictate that chromatic 
dragons find easy to accom-
modate. On more than one 
occasion, a chromatic dragon 
that has pledged itself to Gru-
umsh has risen to command 
an army of despoilers.
Ioun
Ioun is the deity of knowledge, 
skill, and prophecy. Sages, tacti-
cians, and seers revere her, as do 
all who live by their knowledge and 
mental power. Some older chromatic 
dragons become more concerned with 
their wealth of knowledge than the wealth 
of their hoards. These dragons find Ioun a 
natural match and set up shrines to the deity in 
their lairs.
Kord
Kord is the storm deity and the lord of battle. He 
revels in strength, battlefield prowess, and thunder. 
For all these qualities, he draws a few chromatic 
dragons from every generation, especially blue ones. 
An adult blue dragon called Echo leads the Temple of 
Storms in the Windrise Peaks, hallowed to Kord. This 
devout blue flies every night amid the thundering 
clouds. Each day, Echo descends to the valleys to fight 
in the constant skirmishes between quarrelsome orc 
tribes.
Lolth
Lolth is the chaotic evil deity of shadows, lies, and 
spiders. Though she is predominantly known for her 
patronage of the drow, chromatic dragons appreciate 
her deceptive qualities. Black and purple dragons 
might become adherents—and in their study of 
treachery learn something of spiders, too. From time 
to time, drow and chromatics pledged to Lolth work 
together. Lolth’s priestesses attempt to ensure that in 
any such arrangement, the dragon does not gain the 
upper hand. They do not always succeed.

28

LEE MOYER
Melora
Melora is the deity of the wilderness and the sea. She 
personifies the natural aspects of deserts, seas, wild 
lands, and forests. Chromatic dragons sometimes see 
her as the natural protector of such places and find 
the savage fury she can stir in her followers to be 
more pure than the true evil that Tiamat commands. 
A dragon hungers and must eat, but must it cause 
more pain and suffering in doing so than necessary? 
Dragon followers of Melora believe they need not. 
They promise their prey a quick death.
Moradin
Moradin is the lawful good deity of creation and 
the patron of artisans, especially miners and 
smiths. He carved the mountains from 
the elemental earth, giving form to 
what the primordials had left form-
less. The power of Moradin is such 
that he draws a tiny fraction of 
chromatics into his fold, despite 
his alignment.
 
According to one story, a 
black dragon that cleaned 
out a dwarven fortress found 
a shrine to Moradin there. 
Over a period of several years, 
the black learned more about 
the creator deity. In time, the 
dragon pledged itself to the deity’s 
cause. The dragon’s first task was to 
atone for all the dwarves slain in taking 
control of the fortress—a task that required the 
dragon’s remaining centuries to complete.
Pelor
Deity of the sun and summer, Pelor is the keeper 
of time. He supports those in need and opposes all 
forms of evil. Thus, followers of Pelor more often 
oppose chromatic dragons than welcome them into 
their fold. As a quintessentially human deity, Pelor 
strikes chromatics at best as an interfering annoyance 
and at worst as a dangerous foe who inspires crazed 
priests and paladins intent on slaying dragons.
The Raven Queen
Spinner of fate and patron of winter, the Raven 
Queen marks the end of each mortal life. She takes 
away the souls of creatures killed by chromatic drag-
ons, so some dragons see themselves as her agents, 
collecting her due. Some go so far as to adopt the 
Raven Queen as their true deity—especially white 
dragons, who find her command of winter a natural 
extension of their own nature.
Sehanine
Deity of the moon and autumn, Sehanine is the 
patron of trickery and illusions. For this reason, a 
surprising number of chromatics, especially greens 
and blacks, revere her. They see her dominion over 
trickery and illusions as a facet of dominion over love; 
to most chromatics, love is a trick to play on others. 
Purples and grays also sometimes revere Sehanine 
for her instructions to seek new horizons: grays across 
the surface of the world, and purples under it.
Tiamat
Tiamat is the evil deity of wealth, greed, and envy, 
and the patron of chromatic dragons. She urges her 
followers to take vengeance for every slight. 
Most chromatic dragons that worship 
a deity worship Tiamat.
  Tiamat requires that her fol-
lowers keep a vigilant eye out 
for adherents of Bahamut—
whether those adherents are 
dragon or not—and stamp 
them out at any cost. Her 
greed knows no bounds. She 
might even claim the hoards 
of chromatic dragons that do 
not pledge themselves to her.
  Of all the deities, Tiamat 
takes the most mortal consorts—
always dragons. The dragons she 
chooses are usually chromatics, but 
she might court dragons of other families 
if they prove themselves to her.
Torog
Torog is the evil deity of the Underdark, patron of jail-
ers and torturers. Also called the King That Crawls, 
Torog listens for anyone foolish enough to speak his 
name on the surface. If he hears his name, he might 
dispatch a servant to collect the offender. On rare 
occasions, he personally burrows up from below and 
drags the hapless speaker underground to an eternity 
of imprisonment and torture, but he prefers to send 
creatures of the Underdark to do the job—creatures 
such as purple dragons. Legend has it that Torog 
keeps a realm at the center of the world and that 
purple dragons assiduously seek it, believing they will 
find great reward there.
Vecna
Vecna is the evil deity of the undead, necromancy, 
and secrets. He rules that which is not meant to be 
known and that which people wish to keep secret. A 
few dragons prefer Vecna to Tiamat because, despite 
Vecna’s affiliation with the undead, he knows secrets 
likely to surpass those of all other deities. Tiamat 
commands vengeance; Vecna commands the deepest 

29
C H A P T E R  1  |  D ra g o n  L o re
ERIC DESCHAMPS
RELIGION
of dark mysteries. Indeed, dragons that wish to learn 
the secret of becoming undead could do worse than 
follow the tenets of Vecna.
Zehir
Zehir is the evil deity of darkness, poison, and assas-
sins. Snakes are his favored creation, and yuan-ti 
adore him. Despite a long-standing desire to distin-
guish themselves from snakes and reptiles, chromatic 
dragons that have an affinity for darkness and poison 
throw in their lot with Zehir. Green dragons, in 
particular, find reverence to Zehir a natural fit; they 
call each of their victims a sacrifice to the deity of 
darkness.
No Deity
Many chromatic dragons are apostates. They know 
of the existence of the deities—especially Tiamat, 
who helped shape their kind—but either they never 
develop a strong enough reverence for any divine 
being to become worshipers, or they renounce their 
patron deities for one reason or another. Others study 
the convoluted clashes and claims of deities and 
decide divine beings are nothing more than powerful 
individuals claiming prerogatives not due them. After 
all, in the fullness of time, every dragon believes that 
perhaps one day it will become as powerful.
Exarchs
Deities maintain distance and detachment from the 
everyday happenings of the world—even from mighty 
dragons that choose to worship those deities. Thus, 
deities employ exarchs to act on their behalf. Exarchs 
sometimes even go so far as to listen for prayers 
directed toward the deities they serve.
 
Dragon exarchs do more than just help their dei-
ties deal with a cosmos of worshipers: They also act as 
points of familiarity for chromatic dragons interested 
in serving their deities. Although a given dragon 
might not wish to serve Corellon, it might not mind 
offering reverence to Astilabor (see below) and thus 
indirectly serving Corellon.
 
Dragon exarchs are powerful dragons that rise 
in prominence either in the world or out among the 
wider planes. Brief descriptions of some chromatic 
dragon exarchs follow.
Aasterinian
 
Deity: Avandra
 
Aasterinian is a mischievous blue dragon who 
enjoys learning through play, invention, and plea-
sure. She serves primarily as Avandra’s messenger 
and especially likes to deliver decrees that set great 
changes in motion.
 
Dragons that revere Aasterinian appreciate her 
flightiness and quick wits. All dragons applaud her 
stance that they should think for themselves and rely 
on their own devices.
Astilabor
 
Deity: Corellon
 
Astilabor’s hoard was once the penultimate collec-
tion of ancient art, magic, and prose created by the 
deity Corellon. When he invited this red dragon to 
become one of his exarchs, she accepted. She repre-
sents the natural draconic desire to acquire treasure 
and power, tempered by the knowledge that naked 
greed can bring doom to a hoard.
 
Dragons revere Astilabor because of her representa-
tion of wealth and power and because of her guidance 
in avoiding acts that might endanger their hoards. 
Though Astilabor claims to decry thievery, stolen 
goods sometimes find their ways into the hoards of 
dragons that revere her, with no consequence.
Chronepsis
 
Deity: The Raven Queen
 
Chronepsis cares not for a soul’s disposition. This 
gray dragon is silent, unconcerned, and dispassion-
ate—the perfect exarch for the Raven Queen. Indeed, 
for those souls that prove troublesome by lingering 
when they should move beyond, Chronepsis dem-
onstrates a valuable ability to consume the forms of 
dead and undead alike.
 
Dragons that revere Chronepsis see him as a 
passionless judge in fate and death, a disinterested

observer of the world. When dragons die, their souls 
might well pass under his scrutiny. He does not dis-
pense punishment or seek to right perceived wrongs. 
He merely shuttles souls toward their fates.
Falazure
 
Deity: Vecna
 
Known as the Night Dragon, Falazure is known for 
his vampirelike breath of life-draining miasma. He 
appears as a gaunt black dragon sometimes so emaci-
ated he seems more akin to a dracolich.
 
As a devotee of Vecna, Falazure teaches that a mul-
titude of secrets can extend a dragon’s long life even 
longer. Many of those secrets involve necromancy 
and vampiric regeneration, but not all of them do. 
Falazure also knows other hidden dragon secrets, 
so dragons pray to him to learn whatever he will 
divulge.
The following material expands upon information 
already given about the varieties of chromatic drag-
ons. The favored treasure indicated for each variety is 
just that: favored, not exclusive. Similarly, the maxi-
mum life spans are approximations. These numbers 
merely describe the greatest ages that sages have 
confirmed. Individual dragons, particularly those of 
great power and strong will, might live substantially 
longer than the given maximums.
 
Values in the size tables are typical; an individual 
dragon can vary from these figures by as much as 
25 percent—or, for particularly exceptional dragons, 
even more. This deviation occurs frequently among 
Gargantuan dragons, since the size of a truly ancient 
wyrm theoretically has no limit.
Black Dragons
Also called skull dragons (due to the general shape 
of their heads) and swamp dragons, black dragons 
are perhaps the most malicious chromatics. Reds 
might have greater tempers, greens more ambition 
to deceive and control, but few other dragons share 
the cruelty of black dragons. Black dragons hunt not 
merely to survive or to protect their territory, but 
also for the sheer joy of causing pain. They care not 
whether their victims are helpless or hazardous, 
weak or powerful. Violence brings satisfaction.
 
Black dragons are also among the most cowardly 
of chromatic dragons. Though quick to engage in 
combat, they also quickly retreat if opponents prove 
more dangerous than expected. Given black drag-
ons’ propensity for laying ambushes and striking 
from hiding, however, would-be victims might find it 
impossible to distinguish a fleeing black dragon from 
one regrouping to attack from another angle.
 
When possible, black dragons prefer to feed on 
sentient beings, considering fey creatures particular 
delicacies. The bulk of their diet consists of swamp 
creatures such as snakes, alligators, small mammals, 
and birds. Like alligators, black dragons might let 
their prey rot in the mud at the bottoms of swamps 
because they prefer the texture and flavor of putre-
fied flesh.
 
Black dragons fight on land only when circum-
stances force them to do so. They prefer to fight either 
in the water or on the wing.
Lairs and Terrain
Black dragons favor swamps and bogs: anywhere 
with deep, murky water, thick trees, and fetid vegeta-
tion. The water gives them an advantage in combat, 
because the scents of growth and rot common to 
swamps help to cover the acidic tang of the dragons’ 
presence. Only a deep swamp in which a dragon can 
submerge serves the dragon’s purposes, so shallow 
marshes rarely harbor black dragon lairs.
 
When a black dragon cannot find a deep swamp, it 
settles for any area where freshwater and earth come 
together in great quantities. Jungles and rain forests 
might host black dragons, as might lakes in all but the 
coldest climes. Purported lake monsters might in fact 
be black dragons that have gone unrecognized out-
side their usual swamps.
 
Black dragons loathe salt water. Although salt 
water does not harm them, it irritates their flesh like 
a bad rash. Thus, although black dragons might dive 
into salt water to escape foes, they never make their 
homes in salt marshes.
 
For their lairs, black dragons favor systems of 
caves or hollows with multiple chambers, some

LESSER-KNOWN CHROMATICS
Some chromatic dragons are better known than others. 
Among the lesser-known chromatics are varieties that 
might have no connection, past or present, with Tiamat. 
These include browns, grays, and purples. They have 
appeared in previous grimoires and bestiaries as one-offs, 
without affiliation to any known dragon group. Previously 
described respectively as sand, fang, and deep dragons, 
these brown, gray, and purple dragons are not so much 
new chromatics as newly acknowledged members of 
the chromatic dragon family. As such, they are featured 
here along with the better-known chromatic dragon 
varieties.

partly submerged. A black dragon locates the main 
entrance underwater and hides the entrance either 
under thick layers of plant life or under a wall of mud 
through which the dragon can swim.
Favored Treasure
Black dragons favor coins over other sorts of trea-
sure, because coins can survive long-term immersion 
better than fragile paintings or sculpture. Although 
coins tarnish, they do not rust as other metals do. 
Gems might survive even better, but gems show 
up in black dragons’ hoards less frequently than 
coins. One possible reason for this disparity is 
that, since coins are obviously manufactured 
rather than naturally occurring, black dragons 
view them as intrinsically more valuable to their 
(former) possessors than gems.
Life Cycle
The incubation period for a black dragon’s eggs is 
about sixteen months, twelve of those months out-
side the female’s body. A typical clutch consists of 
five to ten eggs. Roughly half of the eggs hatch suc-
cessfully under optimal conditions.
 
A black dragon remains a wyrmling for about four 
years. It reaches adulthood at approximately 125 
years and becomes an elder around the age of 900. 
It becomes ancient at around 1,600 years and passes 
away by the age of 2,200.
 
When a deceased black dragon experiences envi-
ronmental diffusion, the result is an area of abnormal 
humidity and foul soil. Few plants grow there, and 
those that do are poisonous. Any water that collects in 
the area becomes acidic and burns to the touch—not 
enough to cause real damage, but enough to hurt. It is 
not potable.
Physical Characteristics
Black dragons appear abnormally slender in compari-
son to other chromatic dragons—wiry, but not gaunt. 
Although their forward-jutting horns look fearsome, 
the horns serve no offensive use. They simply protect 
the dragon’s head. The sunken eyes contribute to the 
head’s infamous skull-like appearance.
 
When a black dragon submerges, a number of 
muscular and nervous changes take place. The eyes 
bulge dramatically, pressed outward by the dragon’s 
facial muscles as the dragon’s vision adapts to the 
water and murkiness. After this happens, the dragon 
can discern fewer minute details but gains sensitiv-
ity to large shapes and movements.
 A thin layer of webbing stretches between a black 
dragon’s toes, thicker on the rear feet than the fore. 
This webbing grants the dragon its impressive swim-
ming speed. A swimming black dragon uses its tail 
both for propulsion and as a rudder.
 
The hide of a black dragon functions like the skin 
of amphibians: It extracts oxygen from the water 
and feeds the oxygen directly into the bloodstream, 
without the need for gills. This process is less effi-
cient than breathing with lungs, so although black 
dragons are technically amphibious and can remain 
underwater for hours or days, they must surface and 
spend a few hours breathing air at least once or twice 
a week.
 
Black dragons have a strong, acrid scent.

Blue Dragons
Blue dragons, also known as storm dragons, are 
among the most vain and prideful of an arrogant 
race. They take great pleasure in wielding their 
power, engaging in combat or lording over human-
oids and other lesser creatures to prove that they 
can do so, rather than out of any real desire for 
results. A blue dragon might forgive insults, but it 
reacts with rage to any insinuation that it is weak or 
inferior.
 
Blues are also extremely territorial dragons. 
They rarely give intruders, even accidental ones, the 
opportunity to explain themselves. Blue dragons 
are more likely than other varieties of chromatic 
dragons to battle powerful enemies or other dragons 
over violated borders. This can prove particularly 
problematic, given that blue dragons are also 
more finicky about their environment than their 
cousins.
 
When other creatures give due respect to blue 
dragons’ pride and territorial claims, however, 
blues can be the most reasonable of the chromatic 
dragons. Blues lack the cruelty of black dragons and 
the ambition of greens and reds. Some blue dragons 
live as peaceful neighbors of humanoid communities 
or even, on occasion, of other dragon varieties. Blues 
might also employ humanoids to perform tasks for 
them, because blues enjoy both the opportunity to 
command others (thus showing their superiority) and 
the accomplishment of goals without having to exert 
themselves.
 
Blue dragons savor large prey such as cattle and 
herd animals, preferring meals of fewer, larger 
creatures over many small meals. Blues have no par-
ticular desire to hunt sentient prey, but neither have 
they any compunction about doing so if opportunities 
present themselves. Blues prefer their meat charred 
but not cooked through: “lightly kissed by the light-
ning,” as one blue reputedly put it.
 
Blue dragons rarely land during combat, prefer-
ring flight and far-reaching attacks to lumbering over 
land in close melee. Because they like to fight from a 
distance, blue dragons consider combat a long-term 
engagement. They fly near enough to their opponents 
to unleash a few barrages, then vanish, and then 
return—sometimes minutes or hours later.
 
On rare occasions when a blue dragon hunts from 
the ground or rests away from its lair, it conceals itself 
beneath the terrain, burrowing with powerful claws. 
Because most stormy regions have soft ground, such 
as the sand of a coastline or the rich soil of a rain 
forest, blue dragons find it easy to hide in this fashion.
Lairs and Terrain
Sages (and the Monster Manual) maintain that blue 
dragons prefer coastal regions. More precisely, blue 
dragons prefer areas subject to frequent, violent 
storms. Although coastal areas and seaside cliffs fit 
this description, so too do certain tropical isles and 
mountainous highlands not terribly distant from the 
pounding sea.
  If a blue dragon cannot find a properly 
stormy region in which to settle, it can make do 
with whatever terrain is available. As long as it 
has its own territory, a blue dragon might locate 
its lair on a mountaintop, in a jungle, in the 
Underdark, or in a desert—anywhere except per-
haps the coldest of arctic climes—but any blue 
living in a location that lacks frequent storms 
thinks of that location as temporary, even if it 
ends up dwelling there for a few hundred years. 
Ultimately, a blue dragon finds happiness only 
in a place where it hears regular thunder beating on 
the horizon and where it can soar between clouds 
with the lightning.
 
For their lairs, blue dragons favor enormous stone 
ruins or caves in the sides of hills, cliffs, or moun-
tains. Blues enjoy taking over structures built by 
other races. They make their lairs as lofty as possible 
to survey their domains from the heights. Eleva-
tion makes them feel truly part of storms that roll 
through. Even if a blue dragon cannot find or con-
struct a lair at high altitude, it will likely choose a lair 
in which it can easily access the main entrance only 
by flight. Would-be intruders on land must under-
take difficult, if not nearly impossible, climbs.

CHROMATIC DRAGONS IN DETAIL
Favored Treasure
Blue dragons favor treasures as visually appealing 
as they are valuable. Blues love gems, particularly 
sapphires and other blue stones. They equally 
admire lovely works of art and jewelry. Although 
such an event is rare, given blues’ innate draconic 
greed, blue dragons have been known to leave 
behind treasures they find unattractive, feeling that 
the presence of such treasures would sully the mag-
nificence of their hoards and thus the magnificence 
of the dragons themselves.
Life Cycle
Blue dragon eggs incubate for approximately twenty 
months, the last fifteen in the nest. An average 
clutch numbers two to four, and most eggs hatch into 
healthy wyrmlings.
 
Blue dragons grow from wyrmlings into youth 
after about seven years. They become adults around 
age 160 and elders after about a thousand years. They 
become ancient at about 1,800. The oldest known 
blue dragon died at approximately 2,300 years of age.
 
A blue dragon that undergoes environmental 
diffusion after death creates a permanent storm in 
the vicinity. This effect happens even underground, 
though cramped conditions might slacken the 
strength of the winds. Although the severity of wind 
and rain rises and falls, ranging from gentle gusts and 
mild showers to hurricane-force torrents, the storm 
never dissipates entirely, regardless of the prevailing 
weather conditions outside it.
Physical Characteristics
The scales of blue dragons are slightly more reflec-
tive than those of other chromatic dragons. A person 
could not use a blue dragon’s scales as mirrors, but 
in blue or dark environments, the scales take on the 
surrounding hue and blend into the sky or elements 
around them.
 
The horns and brow ridge of a blue dragon funnel 
rainwater and other precipitation away from the 
eyes. When combined with a blue dragon’s keen 
vision, this feature enables the dragon to see better in 
inclement weather than most creatures do.
 
The wings of blue dragons are more flexible than 
those of other chromatics. Blue dragons use winds to 
steer and to boost their speed, like sailors tacking a 
ship.
 
A blue dragon might smell of ozone, though the 
presence of a storm or even a mild wind can mask 
this scent.
Brown Dragons
Brown dragons revel in the comfort of sand-covered 
lairs filled with treasure they have filched from 
desert tombs. Browns also like exotic live food kid-
napped from far lands.
 
To come face to face with a brown dragon requires 
extra work on the part of a would-be vanquisher. 
Brown dragons accomplish their goals in a manner 
that puts them in the least amount of danger—
or, more accurately, requires the least effort. For 
instance, if given a choice between attacking an 
armed castle to eat the baron’s horses or swooping 
down on a straggling bull among a herd of buffalo, a 
brown dragon chooses the latter.
 
Nevertheless, a diet of buffalo or other easily 
acquired herd animals pales after a time, so even 
risk-averse, relatively easygoing brown dragons might 
take progressively greater risks to try new flavors. 
Brown dragons, enamored with eating well, some-
times design elaborate schemes for obtaining unusual 
morsels—schemes of a sort that other dragons would 
apply toward stealing great treasure or defending 
their lairs. To brown dragons, life is best lived by 
eating often and well. A black dragon might find sat-
isfaction in a diet of swamp things and the occasional 
drowned adventurer, but a brown dragon’s ultimate 
happiness comes with new tastes and spices.
 
In the extreme, this peculiarity can result in a 
brown dragon taking unnecessary risks in the heat of

OPTIONAL RULES
A blue dragon ignores any cover or concealment granted 
by rain and other nonfrozen precipitation.
 
Because its scales so closely match the surrounding 
sky, a flying blue dragon can make Stealth checks to hide 
from creatures on the ground or at lower altitude, even 
if it does not have cover or concealment. (It still takes 
all standard Stealth penalties for movement and other 
actions it might take.)
 
Due to its powerful claws and its habit of burrowing in 
the sand or soil of its territory, a blue dragon has a burrow 
speed equal to half its land speed.
 
When flying and fighting in a storm or inclement 
weather, a blue dragon ignores any movement (including 
forced movement) or cover penalties associated with the 
storm.

combat, all for a chance to bite a species never before 
tasted. After a brown dragon samples such a new 
taste, it invariably muses aloud about the flavor while 
the fight continues. Possibly browns intend this as a 
tactic to demoralize foes, but more likely they follow a 
gastronomical compulsion.
 
Brown dragons stand out for another reason 
apart from their love of food. They have the abil-
ity to exhale screaming, blinding sand that hits 
like a concentrated desert sandstorm. 
Indeed, these dragons are like elemen-
tals of the wastelands. The natural 
dangers of its favored terrain are part of 
a brown dragon’s armory. At the extreme, 
an ancient brown dragon’s sandstorm is large 
enough to encompass an entire battlefield. 
Anything caught within such fury is tossed 
about like a doll in a tornado.
Lairs and Terrain
Brown dragons favor desiccated and deserted 
landscapes, places where humanoid societies are 
less likely to thrive and bother them. Browns locate 
their lairs beneath the desert floor, in hollows of 
empty air supported by old ruins or in buried cave 
mouths. Other browns might occupy large ruined 
structures on the desert’s surface, such as grand 
tombs from which looters have long departed.
  A brown dragon’s lair consists of a series of 
rooms or hollow spaces cut off from each other by 
earth or shifting sand. A burrowing brown digs 
tunnels as needed.
Favored Treasure
Brown dragons covet food as much as trea-
sure, and even the treasure they favor takes 
the form of cutlery and crockery, from silver 
tea sets to crystal decanters once used by deities. 
Brown dragons cannot resist seizing fine utensils 
of great value or of noteworthy past ownership. 
They might even employ intermediaries to buy 
these types of treasure.
  Brown dragons appreciate treasures of other 
sorts, too: coins, artwork, rare lore books . . . any-
thing valuable that can fill out their hoards. They 
might also use these kinds of treasure as bait.
Life Cycle
Brown dragons lay their eggs after about five 
months of a fourteen-month incubation period. 
They lay clutches of five to six eggs, with an average of 
three hatching successfully under optimal conditions.
 
The wyrmling stage of brown dragon development 
lasts for approximately eight years. Young browns 
reach adulthood around age 130 and become elders 
after their 600th year. A truly ancient brown dragon 
has lived for at least 1,250 years, give or take a cen-
tury or two. The oldest known brown dragon lived for 
about 2,000 years.
OPTIONAL RULES
A brown dragon in desert or similar wasteland terrain 
gains a +4 bonus to Stealth checks.
 
Some brown dragons dig out hollow areas just beneath 
the surface of the sands. Anyone who walks over such 
an area might cause it to collapse. The collapse does not 
create a sinkhole or endanger the walker, but it does 
create a subsurface, thrumming vibration strong enough 
to alert any nearby brown dragon to the presence of 
intruders.

CHROMATIC DRAGONS IN DETAIL
 
When a brown dragon dies of old age in its desert 
lair, the dry air might preserve and mummify it, 
making it one more relic of lost time buried by the 
desert sands. When a deceased brown dragon experi-
ences environmental diffusion, the result is an area 
of quicksand. Any creature that enters the quicksand 
must succeed on an Acrobatics or Athletics check 
(DC equal to the deceased dragon’s level) in order to 
escape.
Physical Characteristics
The various hues of a brown dragon’s scales allow it 
to blend in with the sands of its terrain. Like green 
dragons, brown dragons might allow their scales to 
become scarred, tarnished, and rough to make them 
appear more like earth or like rocks in the sand.
 
The greatest difference between a brown dragon 
and other chromatics is the strange structure of its 
wings. Instead of normal dragon wings, a double crest 
of spines stretches from the head to the tip of the tail, 
each crest connected to the other by a membranous 
frill. The frill allows a dragon to swim through sand 
and earth, and, if need be, fly through the air.
Gray Dragons
In some ways, gray dragons are the most enigmatic 
of all chromatics. Lacking in distinctive hue, they 
are hunters on stony borderlands, forever soaring in 
the sky’s embrace. Also called fang dragons (for their 
ferocity), stone dragons (for their ability to petrify vic-
tims), and spike dragons (for their detachable spikes), 
these beasts share the worst qualities of other chro-
matic dragons.
 
Grays delight in the hunt at least as much as its 
fruits. Their desperate, animal love of stalking prey 
might be their defining characteristic.
 
Few gray dragons can muster sufficient self-dis-
cipline to reach the heights of power and reputation 
other chromatics enjoy. Grays spend their time far 
from their lairs, glorying in the savage thrill of the 
hunt and basking in their quarry’s fear.
 
Gray dragons are corruptible beasts, willing to 
compromise any stated principle when better alter-
natives come along. Grays particularly delight in 
turning social encounters into excuses to begin elabo-
rate chases. Even when receiving gifts of gold or other 
valuables in exchange for assistance, a fang dragon 
might break off negotiations to present the terms of a 
game, something like this: “You have until sunrise to 
flee as far as you can. At that time, I begin my hunt 
for you. If I find you, you lose.”
 
On the other hand, gray dragons’ unpredictability 
ensures that they do not always act this way. Perhaps 
they know that creatures that fall into routine make 
easier prey themselves. A shrewd diplomat can take 
advantage of this side of a gray dragon’s nature by 
promising the dragon a better, future opportunity for 
a hunt, thus hedging a negotiation away from failure.
 
The occasional gray dragon finds itself the focus 
of savage humanoid tribal worship. Particularly 
primitive tribes might kowtow to gray dragons in 
hopes that the dragons’ aptitude for stalking prey will 
transfer to them. More sophisticated tribes select sac-
rificial victims either from among their own number 
or, more often, from among members of enemy 
tribes or visitors from distant lands. Upon obtain-
ing a victim, members of such a tribe contact the 
gray dragon, possibly with smoke signals. Then they 
release the poor soul with little or no equipment—
perhaps a warning and a flint knife—to flee across 
barren scrubland or badlands.
 
Gray dragons might act as field scouts, spies, and 
hounds for sophisticated locals who have powerful 
interests. Payment for such a service is the service 
itself, which the dragon sees not as a service at all, 
but as an enjoyable pastime. Since a gray invariably 
eats what it catches, employers never entrust it with 
the delivery of live bounty—though the dragon might 
deliver a skull or another gnawed bone fragment 
from its quarry.
 
When hungry enough, a gray might stoop to feed-
ing on domestic cattle, sheep, or other herd beasts, 
but it does so rarely; dim herd animals offer little

thrill or challenge for the chase. Grays subsist almost 
entirely on a diet of humanoids that are intelligent or 
dangerous enough to provide at least the semblance 
of a contest.
 
A gray dragon prefers to stay aloft during a fight. 
From the air, it uses its breath weapon and attacks with 
reach, riveting foes with rocky spikes from tail and 
claws. If one or more opponents take to the air to 
close with the dragon, the gray either focuses all its 
attacks on one or two brave flyers or, if three or more 
attackers have taken wing, beats a hasty retreat for 
the horizon to seek easier prey. Although gray drag-
ons enjoy the hunt, they are less keen on fair fights 
against truly dangerous foes.
Lairs and Terrain
Gray dragons prefer badlands, scrubland, dry prai-
ries, and other clear terrain over terrain that contains 
visual obstructions. They like to see potential quarry 
for miles around as they ride high thermals like 
gigantic birds of prey. A gray can see the tiniest move-
ment across a plain and might dance from thermal to 
thermal for hours to bridge the gap to a distant thing 
it wants to investigate.
 
A gray dragon might establish a temporary lair 
while on an extended hunt in a region far from its 
permanent lair. Such a simple outpost gives the gray 
a place to sleep, a place to eat its catch, and a place to 
store any treasure destined for its main hoard. Grays 
locate these outposts on mountain ledges or in simi-
lar locations accessible only by air. The dragons leave 
such lairs unguarded, returning each night to feast on 
the fruits of their hunts.
 
A gray dragon’s home lair might stand abandoned 
for weeks or months at a time, so before it leaves on a 
hunt the dragon seals the lair’s central chamber with 
an avalanche of boulders and petrified victims.
Favored Treasure
Gray dragons do not prefer any type of treasure over 
any other type. Their hoards typically consist of items 
taken from the victims of past hunts: mementos and 
trophies of glorious successes. Even though gray 
dragons do not value treasure for its own sake to the 
extent that other dragons do, grays nevertheless take 
strong measures to protect their keepsakes.
Life Cycle
A gray dragon lays its eggs after about four months, 
for a total incubation time of twenty months. A clutch 
numbers one to two eggs, all of which prove viable 
under optimal conditions.
  A gray dragon is a wyrmling until about the 
age of ten and is young until nearly age 200. It 
becomes an elder at around 900 years and an 
ancient around 1,400. The oldest confirmed 
age any gray dragon has reached is approximately 
2,100 years.
  When a gray dragon dies, it petrifies, becoming 
a spiky outcropping with an uncannily draconic 
shape. When a deceased gray dragon experiences 
environmental diffusion, the result is an area of 
abnormal aridity. Streams running through the 
area dry up, as do wells. Any creature that spends 
more than an hour in the area becomes parched, 
and water stored in containers somehow 
disappears.
Physical Characteristics
Stony spikes stud gray dragons’ scales and 
limbs. A gray’s spikes can detach, allowing 
it to pin potential prey to the earth with the 
appropriate attack.
  A gray’s scales range from limestone white 
to granite gray, serving as excellent camou-
flage in the dragon’s preferred terrain. As the 
OPTIONAL RULE
Due to its exceptional eyesight, a gray dragon takes only a 
–4 penalty to attack rolls, rather than –5, when attacking 
a target that has total concealment.

dragon flies, its lighter-shaded underbelly blends in 
with clouds and sky from the vantage point of viewers 
on the ground.
 
A gray dragon’s oversized mouth is a sea of fangs. 
Several of its fangs are long enough to prevent the 
dragon from completely closing its mouth. A collec-
tion of fanglike horns protrude from the lower jaw. 
These horns allow the dragon to crack open the exte-
rior of a petrified victim and access the soft interior.
 
Gray dragons smell strongly of sun-warmed stone 
and faintly of long-dead carrion.
Green Dragons
Few dragons are as utterly reviled among human-
oids as green dragons, known also as forest dragons. 
Although green dragons might not be as power-
ful or as destructive as some of their kin, they are 
innately and instinctively deceptive. They lie as easily 
as people speak, and they are good at it. They love 
intrigue and prefer to achieve their goals through 
guile and double-dealing over any other means. Any 
brute can hunt, but it takes skill and intelligence to 
trick one’s prey into offering itself for dinner. Adding 
this attitude to a green’s belligerent nature—to a green 
dragon, a weak creature is either prey or pawn, and 
nearly all creatures are weak—makes the creature a 
loathsome, conniving beast.
 
Green dragons are among the chromatics most 
likely to interfere with nearby humanoid commu-
nities. Some greens terrorize their neighbors into 
obedience. Others play and experiment with local 
political and mercantile interests. A green dragon 
might use bribes and intimidation to gain the coop-
eration of a few select members of a community and 
then see how much authority it can obtain by proxy 
before other humanoids discover its minions. Greens 
might not have lofty goals for this sort of manipula-
tion; they enjoy the process and the practice for its 
own sake.
 
Green dragons might negotiate peaceful coexis-
tence with their neighbors, as long as territories and 
resources do not overlap. Anyone entering into such 
an arrangement, however, should do so with great 
care. Green dragons take devilish delight in finding 
loopholes in such agreements.
 
Green dragons prefer sentient mammalian prey 
over any other kind. Because obtaining such prey can 
be difficult, however, greens subsist mostly on wood-
land creatures, such as deer, bears, and wolves.
 
Perhaps because their terrain often has a canopy 
of vegetation, green dragons fight equally well on 
wing and on land. When battling on or near the 
ground, greens attack from the cover of trees or from 
hidden contours of the earth. Woodland obstacles 
impede humanoid foes’ ranged attacks more than 
they impede green dragons’ area attacks.
 
Green dragons frequently patrol their terrain, 
flying above the canopy and stalking through the 
underbrush. They do this primarily to locate intrud-
ers but also to know every little feature of and change 
to their territory. They learn every possible path, 
hiding place, and refuge. This preparation makes 
them more effective hunters and offers them means 
of retreat if any battles turn against them.
Lairs and Terrain
Green dragons prefer areas of thick vegetation. By 
far, they prefer temperate and cold forests to steamy 
jungles and nonforested land. They particularly 
favor woods with large and imposing trees—the older 
and more massive, the better. Greens might accept 
smaller woods as less desirable alternatives, as well 
as jungles and overgrown bogs. When a green dragon 
cannot find any suitable forest or woodland, it might 
settle for an area of rolling hills or similar terrain, 
using slopes and valleys for cover and concealment in 
the same way that its more fortunate cousins use the 
trees of the forest.
 
Green dragons prefer caves in forested hills and 
cliffsides for their lairs. Where they cannot find such 
convenient openings, they might topple the mightiest 
of trees into great heaps and make their homes in the 
hollows of these wooden hills. Some green dragons 
even lair inside the trunks of the largest, fey-touched 
trees.
Favored Treasure
Although green dragons covet any treasure, they 
particularly like hand-crafted items ranging from 
sculpture and artwork to ornate swords and magic 
armor. They love to own anything into which some-
one else put a lot of work. Though a dragon might 
not force a crafter to create art, the wyrm takes sat-
isfaction in ultimately benefiting from an artisan’s 
creative labor.
 
Green dragons also like to keep large supplies of 
coins and small gems at hand for suborning merchants 
or members of local communities. Though as loath to

part with their wealth as any other dragons, greens 
might consider bribes worthwhile investments if they 
feel that particularly well-placed agents will ultimately 
bring them greater power or amusement.
Life Cycle
Green dragons lay their eggs after about four 
months of a sixteen-month incubation period. They 
lay clutches of three to five eggs, with an average 
of two to four hatching successfully under optimal 
conditions.
 
The wyrmling stage lasts approximately six years. 
Green dragons reach adulthood around age 160 and 
become elders after their 950th year. A truly ancient 
green dragon has lived for at least 1,750 years, give or 
take a century. The oldest known green dragon lived 
for approximately 2,250 years.
 
The environmental diffusion of a deceased green 
dragon results in an area of lush, beautiful, and 
deadly plant growth. Grasses, trees, and other veg-
etation, nearly all of them poisonous, grow swiftly 
to abnormally large size. These areas also touch on 
the Feywild more often than do other parts of the 
woodlands.
Physical Characteristics
The various hues of a green dragon’s scales allow it 
to blend in easily with foliage, an ability that greens 
enhance by allowing their scales to become scarred, 
tarnished, and, in some cases, mossy. As with black 
dragons, green dragons do not use their prominent 
horn as a weapon. Instead, they primarily use their 
nose spike to push foliage and branches out of the 
way as they move through their overgrown domains. 
The crown of horns jutting from a green dragon’s 
head keeps obstacles it has pushed aside with its 
nose spike from springing back into its face and 
obstructing its view.
Purple Dragons
Purple dragons, also known as deep dragons, are 
possibly the least well known of the chromatic 
dragon family. Most surface creatures have no 
knowledge of the existence of purple dragons. Many 
of those that have heard of purple dragons dismiss 
such stories as myth or misconception. After all, in 
the darkness below the earth, who can say whether 
a dragon’s scales are purple or black?
 
Black dragons rarely live far underground. The 
deeper explorers descend, the more likely they are to 
encounter a purple dragon than a black. People who 
live permanently in the deep hollows of the earth 
know purple dragons as an all-too-real and much-
feared threat.
 
A purple dragon is a talented manipulator of other 
creatures. It achieves control through lies, misdirec-
tion, and direct mental domination. A purple dragon 
might seek control for any number of reasons, includ-
ing sheer delight in bandying its power about, a 
desire to form a bulwark of allies and thralls for secu-
rity, or curiosity about newly discovered tunnels or 
crevices leading to unknown areas deeper below, for 
which recruiting bands of disposable explorers might 
serve its purposes.
 
As much as purple dragons enjoy controlling other 
creatures, however, they enjoy the thrill of explora-
tion even more. Even as explorers discover new lands 
on the surface, purple dragons consider the globe’s 
surface a paltry expanse compared to the deep 
volume of the world’s interior, a space containing 
orders of magnitude more possibility. In such a vast 
space, wonderful mysteries await discovery. Whether 
they follow tradition or answer a call in their blood, 
deep dragons delight in exploration more than any 
other kind of wyrm, especially if that exploration 
OPTIONAL RULES
A green dragon in thickly forested or other vegetation-
heavy terrain gains a +4 bonus to Stealth checks.
 
Some green dragons regularly dose the thorns and 
brambles of plants in their territory with their poison-
ous breath, eventually building up a dangerous coating. 
Anyone pushed or pulled into a thorn bush or briar so 
treated takes 3 poison damage and ongoing 3 poison 
damage (save ends), in addition to any damage the thorns 
normally deal. Manipulating or attempting to climb plants 
treated in this way results in 1 point of poison damage 
and ongoing 1 poison damage (save ends).

leads deeper into the earth. Purple dragons relish the 
discovery of places never before trod upon by sentient 
creatures—or at least not visited for ages.
 
A purple dragon might negotiate with people who 
offer information about undiscovered locations deep 
in the earth, but only if the dragon believes that its 
negotiators can provide more maps and information 
in the long term than it can obtain by dispatching or 
dominating them immediately. If such a negotiation 
succeeds, a purple dragon can prove a reasonable 
short-term ally. In fact, purple dragons have allied 
with disparate groups of drow many times over the 
centuries. Purples have also allied with undead, 
sometimes laying clutches of eggs with wraiths or 
shadows nearby to watch over the hatcheries.
 
Purple dragons favor prey caught in sunless seas 
and subterranean rivers. They consume blind albino 
fish caught en masse but especially like to season 
their diets with kuo-toas and aboleths. In a pinch, a 
purple dragon will hunt down living creatures of any 
other kind.
 
When a purple dragon must fight for food or 
information, it attempts to spy upon its intended 
targets long enough to learn something useful before 
announcing itself. It might even let the targets of its 
observation go on their way. If hungry enough, feel-
ing territorial, or wanting to play, however, a purple 
dragon takes its quarry by surprise if possible.
 
Purple dragons keep to the peripheries of caverns 
during fights. They especially like to lurk near bolt-
holes, in case events turn against them. Ideally, a 
dragon suborns one or more targets each round with 
its dominating gaze, seeding chaos and fear in the 
ranks of its foes.
Lairs and Terrain
Purple dragons live in caves, caverns, subterranean 
vaults, and other Underdark regions, where they 
remain safe from sunlight, which harms them. They 
can hear distant noises transmitted through rock and 
soil. Accustomed to the ways of the sound-distorting 
depths, a deep dragon can catch the sound of the 
merest cave cricket skittering up a wall on the far side 
of a vast cavern.
 
Purple dragons never venture from the deep 
recesses of the earth except, on occasion, to emerge 
in the Shadowfell. Some deep dragons take residence 
in the sunless realm, especially where rifts exist 
between worldly caverns and Shadowfell regions.
 
Because purple dragons like to explore, they can 
stray from their permanent lairs for great lengths of 
time. Older purples with sufficient resources seek 
scrolls of Linked Portal and similar rituals that allow 
them to travel quickly between their lairs and the 
frontiers of their subterranean expeditions.
 A purple dragon’s permanent lair is a honeycomb 
of rocky hollows connected by narrow, winding tun-
nels. Many tunnels lead to dead ends or traps and 
require real feats of exploration (a complexity 3 skill 
challenge) for anyone new to the lair to find a way 
through. Sometimes purple dragons make their lairs 
in the structures of previous Underdark residents, 
if the chambers and connecting hallways are elabo-
rate enough for the dragons’ taste.
Favored Treasure
Purple dragons like wealth as much as any other 
dragon, but their favorite items are rare maps and 
cartographic tools, especially tools with magical 
enhancements. Purple dragons also prize items 
that allow them to withstand the effects of warm 
regions, which they encounter more often as they 
penetrate deeper into the Underdark.
Life Cycle
Purple dragon eggs incubate for approximately twenty-
five months, the first eight inside the female dragon. 
An average clutch numbers about six, and about half of 
the eggs hatch into healthy wyrmlings. Purple dragons

might lay their eggs in places where animate spirits 
are bound to the area. Such spirits might touch grow-
ing wyrmlings with their Shadowfell-derived necrotic 
resonances.
 
Purple dragons grow into youth after about nine 
years. They become adults at about age 190 and 
elders after about 1,100 years. They become ancients 
at about 2,200 years. Reports of purple dragons near 
the world’s core tell of some that reach 3,000 years or 
more.
 
When a purple dragon dies, any creature that 
sleeps within the vicinity ever afterward has fierce 
nightmares. When a deceased purple dragon experi-
ences environmental diffusion, the result is an area 
where small mushrooms spring up and the dreams 
of sleepers are troubled. Creatures attempting to rest 
in such an area are afflicted with nightmares, and on 
a failed saving throw, fail to gain the benefits of an 
extended rest.
Physical Characteristics
The long body of a purple dragon is particularly 
lithe—catlike and serpentine. The swept-back wing 
structure and sleek, tapered head allow it to worm its 
way through narrow subterranean tunnels.
 
Purple dragons have an odor reminiscent of the 
musky smell of ophidians.
Red Dragons
When legends, fairy tales, and fables speak of drag-
ons without specifying a color—when they tell of 
kingdoms laid waste, virtuous maidens sacrificed, 
and valiant heroes sent home as charred corpses—
odds are that they speak of the mighty red dragons. 
Also called flame dragons, fire wyrms, and mountain 
dragons, these horrific beasts epitomize the iconic 
dragon traits. All dragons are predators, but reds 
are the most voracious, consuming far more than 
they require. All dragons are greedy, but reds are 
avaricious beyond any point of reason, for they fully 
believe that all wealth belongs to those strong enough 
to take it (and no amount of wealth is ever enough). 
All dragons are prideful, but reds are arrogant in the 
extreme. They see themselves as the pinnacle of dra-
conic perfection.
 
Red dragons never forgive even the smallest 
slights. They kill over territorial intrusion, over the 
tiniest theft from their hoard, over an insult, or 
because they want to. These great beasts take satis-
faction wherever and however they can get it. A red 
dragon unable to slay a person who offends it will go 
on a rampage, wreaking havoc and destruction upon 
any nearby communities. Only enormous monetary 
tributes can sate the legendary rage of a red dragon; 
only blood can cool and drown that rage.
 
Red dragons are not mindlessly violent, however. 
Accomplished strategists, they spend their time 
developing vast arrays of tactics for use in every con-
ceivable combat scenario. They recognize the hazards 
in attacking more potent foes—rare though such foes 
might be. They back down from fights they do not 
believe they can win, though doing so wounds their 
pride to the bone.
 
A humanoid community that borders on a red 
dragon’s territory can sometimes forestall the beast’s 
wrath by offering frequent tribute in the form of trea-
sure and tasty young adults. Some red dragons enjoy 
the power in ruling communities of lesser creatures, 
but unlike green dragons, who do so by subtlety and 
intrigue, reds demand obedience and slaughter all 
who fail to comply. Red dragons take interest in news 
of the world beyond their territories, in part so they 
know how their status compares to that of other reds. 
They might threaten homes and families in order to 
force humanoids to travel into the wild and obtain 
news. Most such unwilling messengers do not survive 
to return, but red dragons have no qualms about that 
turn of events. Humanoids are a renewable resource.
 
Like most dragons, reds can survive on almost 
anything but prefer meat. More than any other 
variety of dragon, though, red dragons hate to eat any-
thing else. Some starve themselves nearly to death 
rather than consume plants or inorganic matter. They 
eat any animals: humanoids, wild beasts, and even 
other dragons—the younger, the better. Their prefer-
ence for tender meats gave rise to legends of dragons 
kidnapping young people.
 
Reds fight equally well on land or in the air. They 
relish melee combat as an opportunity to showcase 
their superior strength. A red dragon never hesi-
tates to use its breath weapon, though, when the need 
presents itself. It would rather reduce any possible 
treasure or magic items to ash than allow the bearers 
of those items to best it in combat: The dragon’s pride 
overpowers its avarice.
 
Although red dragons might refrain from attack-
ing enemies that seem too strong, reds never retreat 
from combat once any combatant sheds blood. Due to 
their hubris, red dragons fight to the death more than 
any other kind of chromatic dragon, even when they 
have the option to escape.
OPTIONAL RULES
A purple dragon ignores cover bonuses granted by 
stalagmites, stalactites, and other naturally occurring 
subterranean features.
 
A purple dragon can hear noises in caverns miles away 
by resting its head on a cavern floor, partially digging the 
protrusions of its lower jaw into the stone or earth. It 
detects minute vibrations traveling through the ground 
and correctly interprets those vibrations for what they are 
(such as movements of creatures far distant from it)—at 
least when it actively attempts to sense them.

CHROMATIC DRAGONS IN DETAIL
Lairs and Terrain
Although a red dragon’s first terrain choice is some-
where elevated and especially hot, such as a volcano 
or a sulfurous geyser, a red does not require such a 
location. It might take residence in a normal moun-
tain peak, in rocky badlands, or on a desert mesa: 
any location where it can perch high and survey its 
domain for miles around. Red dragons loathe the 
cold, but cold does not harm them any more than it 
does other creatures. A few reds even make their 
homes among snow-capped peaks, because altitude 
matters to them more than temperature. A red that 
can boast a lair combining altitude and temperature, 
such as one atop a volcanic peak, considers itself for-
tunate indeed.
 
Red dragons prefer large caves or complexes of 
caves, with access both to high vantage points and 
to the depths of the earth. Though they seek high 
ground for surveying their territory, they feel safer 
sleeping and storing their treasure beneath layers of 
rock. Because such complexes rarely occur naturally, 
red dragons frequently take over caverns dug by other 
races, or they enslave people to construct or modify 
their lairs. Red dragons looking for homes scour out 
and claim many an underground or partially under-
ground community, such as dwarven cities and drow 
access tunnels. Because of this behavior, and despite 
their preference for high perches, red dragons occa-
sionally come into conflict with purple dragons.
Favored Treasure
Red dragons’ favorite treasure is everything in their 
hoards, everything of value in other dragons’ hoards, 
and everything of value possessed by anyone else. So 
unabashedly and indiscriminately greedy are reds that 
no common preferences, habits, or patterns in treasure 
acquisition emerge. Although individuals might have 
specific preferences, the average red dragon does not 
care what form its treasure takes.
Life Cycle
A red dragon lays its eggs roughly five and a half 
months into the incubation time of twenty-two 
months. A clutch numbers two to four eggs, and all 
prove viable under optimal conditions.
  A red dragon is a wyrmling until the age of eight 
or so, and young until about 200. It attains elder 
status at around 950 and becomes an ancient around 
1,900. The oldest known red dragon reached approx-
imately 2,500 years.
  When it occurs, a red dragon’s environmental 
diffusion takes one of two forms, depending on its 
surroundings. In a mountainous or rocky area, the 
spot where the dragon dies breaks open, revealing 
one or more large, sulfurous geysers or small volcanic 
vents that emit foul-smelling and acrid smoke even 
when not erupting. In less stony and more flammable 
areas, a permanent wildfire results, never spreading 
beyond the boundaries of the diffusion and never 
burning out, regardless of fuel or weather.
Physical Characteristics
Red dragons are the largest of chromatic dragons. 
Their wings are vast in proportion to their bodies, 
making red dragons easily identifiable even from a 
great distance. Unlike the scales of other chromatic 
dragons, red dragons’ scales rarely blend in with their

backgrounds—with the possible exception of back-
grounds of raging fire. Conspicuousness suits these 
beasts just fine. They have no interest in hiding from 
lesser creatures.
 
Two of the frills on the sides of a red dragon’s head 
aid in its hearing ability. Though not external ears—
red dragons, like all chromatic dragons, have internal 
ears only—these frills help the dragon pick up sounds 
and determine directionality.
 
Red dragons smell of smoke and sulfur. The air 
around them sometimes shimmers, as though viewed 
through a heat mirage.
White Dragons
White dragons—also called ice dragons or glacial 
wyrms—have a reputation as dull, stupid creatures. 
They do not deserve it. Although white dragons are 
remarkably bestial, they are as intelligent as other 
chromatic dragons. They care little for intricate 
schemes or political power, preferring to live their 
lives as hunters and collectors of treasure. They rely 
more on instinct than on intellect. Although they still 
live long and look to the distant future, they do not 
worry about the future to the extent that their cousins 
do. They prefer merely to keep themselves comfort-
ably fed and housed.
 
Like all capable predators, white dragons are mas-
ters of their territories. They know the good hiding 
spots and optimal ambush points. They hunt not only 
well, but brutally. They kill swiftly and efficiently. 
They lack the cruelty of black dragons and the feroc-
ity of reds. They also lack those dragons’ inclination 
to engage with or manipulate intruders or neighbors. 
Unless potential victims quickly offer solid reasons 
not to kill them, white dragons likely slay first, eat 
second, and never consider asking questions. The 
few offers known to have saved fast-talking travelers 
included gifts of gems with promises of more gems to 
come or, even better, gifts and promises of more meat 
than the travelers themselves would provide if eaten.
 
Like all chromatic dragons, white dragons look 
down on other creatures. In the white dragon’s case, 
this attitude is evidence of its tendency to view all 
living creatures as potential prey. Prey is, after all, 
inferior to the hunter strong enough to eat it.
 
Rarely, if ever, can a community negotiate peaceful 
coexistence with a white dragon whose territory bor-
ders it. Members of a community might have a slim 
chance of convincing a dragon to leave their livestock 
alone, at least for a while, if they display a significant 
show of force or give a truly magnificent bribe. Bar-
ring these options, however, nothing but the dragon’s 
death can stop it from hunting the people’s herd 
animals—and probably the people themselves.
 
As animalistic hunters, white dragons have little 
preference among types of prey. They attack and eat 
the most convenient creatures worth the trouble of 
killing. Because farmers’ cattle offer a lot more meat, 
they interest a white dragon more than the farm-
ers themselves—but a dragon does not balk at eating 
available sentient beings. White dragons prefer 
frozen foods, burying their prey in snowbanks or 
walls of ice for days or weeks before consuming it.
 
White dragons possess a few traits not purely 
predatory. Like reds and blues, they have especially 
long memories for grudges and insults. They might 
seek revenge for slights many years after erring par-
ties have forgotten them.
Lairs and Terrain
White dragons truly love the cold. The vast major-
ity of them live either on mountain peaks covered 
in snow year-round or on tundra or glacial plains. 
White dragons particularly benefit from the way icy 
terrain slows their prey, because such terrain does not 
impede the dragons themselves.
 
White dragons do not need bitter cold, however. 
Some of them dwell in mountain peaks not nearly as 
frozen as they prefer. Some might even live in forests. 
Such lairs occasionally cause white dragons to come 
into conflict with red, blue, or green dragons—battles 
the white dragons would rather avoid, because other 
dragons of comparable age are more powerful. Also, 
as born hunters, white dragons resent expending 
energy that does not result in the acquisition of prey.
 
As with most dragons, a white prefers to lair in 
a cave: in this case, either in a deep mountain crev-
ice or a shallower hollow in ice. In an area where 
the temperature never rises above freezing, a white 
dragon might create a cave out of tightly packed snow 
and freeze it into hard ice through judicious applica-
tion of its breath weapons.

SAM WOOD
CHROMATIC DRAGONS IN DETAIL
Favored Treasure
White dragons prefer treasure that glitters like ice, 
particularly diamonds and other light-hued gem-
stones. Highly polished platinum and silver also 
serve, as do works of art that involve mirrors or mir-
ror-polished surfaces.
Life Cycle
White dragon eggs incubate for a period of roughly 
fourteen months, the first three and a half of which 
they spend within the female’s body. White dragons 
lay clutches of eight to ten eggs each, but only a quar-
ter to a third of them survive until they hatch.
 
A white dragon’s wyrmling stage lasts for three 
or four years. The young stage lasts until the age of 
one hundred. An adult dragon becomes an elder at 
roughly 750 years, and an elder becomes ancient at 
about 1,700. White dragons have been known to live 
as much as 2,100 years.
 
A white dragon’s environmental diffusion results 
in an area of intense, biting cold. Frost covers the 
ground at all times, and liquids freeze after a few 
moments of exposure to the elements. The terrain 
becomes as slippery as ice, even if it does not appear 
frozen.
Physical Characteristics
White dragons are the smallest of the chromat-
ics, albeit only slightly smaller than their black 
cousins. Their scales and limbs are heavy, making 
them seem ponderous, though in fact they move as 
swiftly and dexterously as other dragons. Ranging 
from true white to gray or ice-blue, white dragons’ 
scales serve as excellent camouflage in icy and 
snowy terrain.
  The toes of white dragons are more widely 
spaced than those of other dragons, granting greater 
stability on uncertain footing. Claws are barbed and 
jagged, not to cause any extra damage in combat, but 
to aid the dragon in walking on ice.
 
Nictitating membranes protect the eyes from 
extremes of light while still allowing the dragon 
to see. These parchment-thin lids prevent snow 
blindness when a dragon looks over vast, gleaming 
expanses of its territory.
 
White dragons have a dry scent—more a lack of 
odor than a smell in its own right.

OPTIONAL RULES
A white dragon gains a +1 bonus to its defenses to avoid 
any effect that causes blindness due to bright light, 
and it gains a +1 bonus to saving throws to end said 
blindness.
 
A white dragon can burrow through ice and snow at a 
speed equal to half its land speed.
 
The features of a white dragon’s claws that grant its ice-
walking ability also grant a +4 bonus to Athletics checks 
made for climbing.

DM’s Guide to Dragons
DM’s Guide to Dragons
The sounds of the wild suddenly go silent. Animals cease 
their calls. Even the wind holds its breath. Then the slow, 
steady drumbeats of enormous wings slice through the 
silence. Darkness falls as a monstrous shadow blots out the 
sun. . . .
It almost goes without saying that dragons 
are an iconic part of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS®
game. They’re in the name, after all. More than that, 
though, dragons are an iconic element of myth and 
fantasy. Their legends date back to the earliest days 
of written history. Whether you prefer your dragons 
as scheming masterminds or as monstrous engines of 
destruction (or both), players’ interaction with them 
should be momentous. Make every encounter with a 
dragon and every dragon-themed adventure unique—
flavorful and memorable. Whether the dragons are 
friends or foes, the encounters are combative or dip-
lomatic, the adventures are low-level or epic, dragons 
should command attention, awe, and respect.
 
This chapter includes an array of advice, tools, and 
examples to enable your dragons to do just that:
✦Draconic Encounters: Suggestions on how to 
run dragon encounters—combative, social, and 
trap-based—include ready-to-play examples that 
you can drop into your adventures with little or no 
modification. 
✦Draconic Adventures: An assortment of adven-
ture hooks and quests, presenting dragons as both 
allies and enemies, should serve as inspiration for 
sessions of exciting play. 
✦Draconic Campaigns: If you really want to 
emphasize the “dragon” in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, 
you can use the entire dragon-focused campaign 
arcs provided as well. 
✦Dragon Hoards: Finally, this chapter con-
tains tools for creating one of the most iconic 
elements of a dragon story: the hoard. Fully 
detailed hoards, draconic artifacts, ancient ritu-
als, and even arcane uses for the teeth, scales, 
and organs of fallen wyrms ensure that PCs 
receive ample rewards for their efforts against 
these mightiest of foes.
 
 
Those PCs who survive, anyway.


46
C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
Other adversaries might be as intelligent, scheming, 
territorial, avaricious, or brutally powerful as drag-
ons. Few combine all those traits in a single package.
Combat Encounters
Encounters should be as fun as they are challeng-
ing. In most cases, players will find ways to counter 
dragons’ tactics and advantages, but if a battle with 
a wyrm becomes too frustrating for the PCs, tone it 
down and run the beast at less than full effectiveness.
 
Although specifics vary, different chromatic 
dragons might resort to similar overall tactics. In 
particular, they use hit-and-run tactics and tactics 
involving the terrain and environment.
Hit-and-Run: Although only a few varieties (such 
as blues and young greens) prefer hit-and-run over 
other tactics, all chromatic dragons are well suited 
to such tactics. Even dragons that favor melee might 
resort to hit-and-run when injured or when faced 
with particularly powerful opposition. Fortunately 
for their opponents, most dragons engage in strafing 
runs only for brief periods of time before bloodlust, 
impatience, or pride causes them to reenter melee.
Terrain and Environment: Dragons frequently 
take advantage of, or even create, terrain and envi-
ronments that grant them the advantage in battle. 
Dragons know the features and hazards of their sur-
roundings intimately.
Sample Encounters
You can drop the following encounters into your 
adventures without too much elaboration. You might 
also use them as examples on which to base your own 
encounters. Each example includes the dragon type, 
environmental features of the area, and suggested 
tactics.
Swamped (Level 5): The nature of the creature 
lurking in the murky swamp won’t surprise the PCs—
but its actions might.
Dragon: Young black.
 
Water: The swamp’s water is deep enough that 
Small characters must swim. Medium characters can 
swim or walk, but if they choose the latter, the water 
and muddy bottom are difficult terrain. The DC to 
swim here is 10, increased from the normal 5 due to 
the grittiness of the water and unseen obstacles. The 
water is dark, thanks to the mud and detritus. Any-
thing underwater is heavily obscured.
 
Leeches: Bloodthirsty leeches swarm in the mud 
beneath the water. Walking characters take 1 
damage per round when they start a turn standing in 
water. The leeches ignore the dragon.
Tactics: The dragon remains underwater. If the 
characters are in a raft or boat, the dragon attempts to 
capsize the craft as its first action. It uses close attacks 
as often as it can. It tries to remain hidden in the 
murk, swimming away and coming back at the party 
from different angles. If it catches any PCs alone, it 
attempts to grab them and hold them underwater, 
attempting to drown them before the other charac-
ters can find them.
On the Edge (Level 5): When climbing an 
imposing cliff face, the PCs present a target too 
tempting for a dragon to pass up.
Dragon: Young gray.
Cliff Face: The cliff requires a DC 20 Athletics 
check to traverse. The cliff stands 50 feet high.
Tactics: The gray dragon initiates combat using its 
breath weapon and then concentrates melee attacks 
and bull rush attempts on a chosen target, hoping 
to knock the target from the cliff. If the dragon suc-
ceeds, it follows the target to the ground, seeking to 
finish the fallen enemy before its allies can descend 
to provide aid.
Poison Ivy (Level 12): A hunters’ trail through the 
forest might prove easy to walk, but it is far from safe.
Dragon: Adult green.
 
Foliage: Due to thick shadows and overgrown 
leaves, the forest is lightly obscured.
 
Difficult Terrain: The path is normal terrain, but the 
rest of the forest is overgrown enough to qualify as 
difficult terrain.
 
Thickets: Several tightly packed thickets and bram-
bles grow in the area. These features grant cover. The 
dragon has also treated the thorns with poison. Any 
character bull rushed or otherwise forced into one of 
these areas takes 1d8 poison damage, and ongoing 5 
poison damage (save ends). An attempt to climb them 
deals 1 poison damage.
 
Trees: The trees grant cover. Climbing a tree 
requires a DC 10 Athletics check.
Tactics: The green dragon remains at a short dis-
tance early in the battle, using ranged and close 
attacks and trusting the concealment of the foliage to 
protect it. It uses luring glare either to bring a single 
PC into breath weapon range or, when melee appears 
inevitable, to move a PC off the path into difficult ter-
rain or to shove a PC into a thicket.
Sun-Baked Sands (Level 16): This encounter 
occurs in the desert, near the base of a large sand 
dune, one of many in the area.
Dragon: Adult brown.
 
Sand: The sand is difficult terrain.
 
Dunes: A dune grants cover against enemies on the 
ground to a creature just over the top on the opposite 
side.

C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
DRACONIC ENCOUNTERS
Tactics: The brown dragon opens with a breath 
weapon and frequently takes cover behind a dune. 
If the PCs draw near the base of a dune, the dragon 
strikes the back side of the rise, causing a landslide of 
sand in all squares within 10 feet of the front of the 
dune. The landslide is an attack, +19 vs. Reflex; on 
a hit, a PC is knocked prone, and immobilized (save 
ends). (A character must negate the immobilized 
condition before standing up.) On a miss, a PC is 
knocked prone. The area becomes difficult terrain. 
If any PCs are immobilized by the avalanche, the 
dragon focuses its attacks on those remaining, hoping 
to kill them before the others free themselves.
Wildfire (Level 23): This encounter can take 
place in any place that easily burns: a dry forest, a 
field of grain, or an old village.
Dragon: Elder red.
 
Spreading Fires: Large swaths of the region are 
already on fire. A burning square deals 10 fire damage 
to any character who enters it and 5 fire damage to any 
character who begins a turn adjacent to it.
 
Smoke: Smoke chokes the entire area, making the 
area lightly obscured.
Tactics: The red dragon has deliberately started these 
fires, blasting various spots of this dry region. It seeks to 
force the PCs into the embrace of the flames, knowing 
full well that it suffers no harm while battling within 
fire. If the PCs prove more of a challenge than the 
dragon expects, it attempts to move out of range and 
continues to spread the fire, forcing the PCs to fight 
through an ever-spreading wall of flame to escape.
Rain of Terror (Level 29): Caught out in inclem-
ent weather, the PCs face more than the storm.
Dragon: Ancient blue.
Rain: Rain makes the area lightly obscured.
Tactics: The dragon makes multiple strafing passes 
against the party, using its breath weapon when it can 
and its other close and area attacks when it cannot. 
When circling back against the wind, it does so at a 
distance, well out of sight of the party.
Social Encounters
Not every encounter with a chromatic dragon ends 
in bloodshed. Although some dragons just want to 
destroy, others engage in conversation and even nego-
tiate with humanoids. Intensely proud, dragons have 
keen ears for genuine (-sounding) flattery. A dragon, 
not foolhardy, might also take the time to listen to 
humanoids’ proposals involving gain without risk. 
It can always eat the little pests after hearing them 
speak their piece.
 
The trick to interacting with dragons is to consider 
their mind-set as much as possible. Dragons that 
enter into negotiations with lesser creatures keep the 
following considerations in mind.
Position of Strength: With few exceptions, drag-
ons assume that they have better bargaining positions 
than those who approach them. Dragons believe 
themselves more powerful, more knowledgeable, 
smarter, and generally superior to anyone with whom 
they interact. Negotiators who play to a dragon’s vanity 
and make at least a show of giving up more than they 
will receive can do well. Negotiators who attempt to 
make demands or to explain why a dragon needs their 
help had better have solid arguments or quick feet.
Careful Tread: Dragons negotiate carefully. They 
ponder intricacies, consider ramifications, and agree 
only to actions for which they understand—or believe 
they understand—all possible consequences. Some 
people (outside a dragon’s earshot) might attribute 
this caution to fear of being duped or endangered. 
Dragons attribute it to wisdom. Negotiators should 
make efforts to appear open and up front, because 
dragons take issue with anyone they suspect of har-
boring secrets or of trying to put one over on them.
The Long Term: Dragons take the long view. 
(This characteristic ties into their tendency to 
ponder decisions thoroughly.) Barring violent death, 
a dragon expects to be around when a negotiator’s 
great-great-grandchildren die of old age. It might 
accept a seemingly poor deal if it foresees great gains 
from the deal in the future. Alternatively, the dragon 
might reject even an apparently great offer if the long-
term implications bear out an unfavorable result. 
Negotiators who give thought and lip service to the 
ramifications of their proposals can earn a dragon’s 
respect. Those who emphasize short-term gains likely 
earn derision.
Sample Skill Challenges
As in the previous section, you can use these skill 
challenges in your own adventures as written or let 
them inspire you to create your own encounters. In 
the encounters that follow, read each opening para-
graph aloud to your group of adventurers to lead 
into the encounter. You can also read the setups to 
the PCs.
The King’s Vizier
The great double doors close behind you with a resounding 
crash. The long hall, normally full with the king’s court and 
advisors, is all but empty, the benches along both sides bare. 
Only the royal vizier remains, in all his gleaming glory. 
He coils around the throne and stares at you unblinkingly. 
“Now . . . tell me why you haven’t left and why I shouldn’t 
eat you for your disobedience.”
The PCs hoped to gain an audience with the king 
to request his assistance. Unfortunately for them, 
his vizier—a dragon that has advised the king and 
the king’s predecessors for decades—considers the 
characters potential rivals for power. It wants them 
nowhere near the king and even wants to put an end 
to their moving about the kingdom.

C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
 
Setup: For the dragon to allow you access to the 
king—or even to allow you to remain within the capi-
tal—you must convince it that you pose no threat.
Level: 14.
Complexity: 3 (requires 8 successes before 3 
failures).
 
Primary Skills: Bluff, History, Streetwise.
 
Bluff (DC 23): The PCs downplay their abilities 
and possibly their ambitions, trying to convince 
the dragon to see them as less of a threat. For each 
successful check, they achieve 1 success. They can 
achieve up to 4 successes with this skill.
 
History (DC 18): The PCs discuss historical tales and 
apocryphal myths about advisors, both traitorous and 
well meaning, who prevented their lieges from hearing 
bad news or from learning news of their realms—
and who suffered disastrous repercussions. For each 
successful check, they achieve 1 success. They can 
achieve up to 4 successes with this skill. On a failure, 
the dragon pokes holes in the stories or declares them 
false; the PCs lose 1 success (if they have any).
 
Streetwise (DC 26): The PCs repeat rumors or 
whispers of ambition among other royal advisors or 
powerful merchants, pointing out those personali-
ties’ greater danger to the dragon’s position. The PCs 
have also heard whispers of the dragon’s own goals 
and ambitions. On a successful check, they achieve 
2 successes and gain a +2 bonus to Bluff checks and 
Diplomacy checks until one of those checks fails. 
They can achieve only 2 successes with this skill.
 
Other Skills: Arcana, Diplomacy, Intimidate, 
Religion.
 
Arcana or Religion (DC 14): The PCs remind the 
dragon of ancient theories and myths that the good of 
the king and the good of the kingdom influence each 
other—and that the king risks both by preventing 
this potential alliance. On a successful check, they 
achieve 1 success. They can achieve only 1 success 
with either of these skills.
 
Diplomacy (DC 18): The PCs simply and straight-
forwardly explain what they can offer the king and 
the kingdom. On a successful check, they achieve 1 
success. They can achieve only 1 success with this 
skill. On a failure, the dragon decides the PCs are 
ambitious; each future check in this challenge takes a 
–1 penalty until the PCs earn 2 more successes.
 
Intimidate: The dragon shrugs off any attempt 
at intimidation and takes it as evidence of the PCs’ 
power and ambition. If the PCs attempt an Intimi-
date check, they lose 1 success (if they have any).
 
Success: The dragon allows the PCs to remain 
and to gain audience with the king.
 
Failure: If the PCs scored 4 or more successes 
before failing, the dragon lets them pass only after 
warning the vizier not to trust them. Apply a –2 pen-
alty to any skill checks made to influence the vizier.
 
If the PCs scored 1 to 3 successes, the dragon 
remains convinced of the PCs’ threat and demands 
that they leave the palace and city immediately. If the 
PCs have no successes when they fail the challenge, 
the dragon waits until they leave and then sends sol-
diers or assassins after them.
The Long and Winding Road
Leaves blow across the crossroads, heralded by the flapping 
of wings. The sun goes dark.
 
“I am here as agreed.” The enormous wyrm lands in the 
dust before you, tail twitching like a hunting cat’s. “What 
did you wish to discuss?”
A powerful mercantile guild wishes to expand its 
influence, and the PCs currently serve as its emissar-
ies. (Perhaps the guild hired them, or perhaps they 
have allied with or joined it.) The guild seeks use of 
a road that runs through the dragon’s territory and 
wants a deal in which the wyrm will not attack travel-
ers flying the guild’s colors.
 
Setup: For the dragon to agree to your proposal, 
you must convince it that allowing regular passage 
through its territory will benefit it more than raiding 
the guild’s caravans.
 
Level: 26.
 
Complexity: 4 (requires 10 successes before 3 
failures).
 
Primary Skills: Diplomacy, Nature, Religion.
 
Diplomacy (DC 26): The PCs weigh the benefits 
of guild payment against how much the dragon can 
expect to gain from random raids that might never 
touch the richest travelers. For each successful check, 
they achieve 1 success. They can achieve up to 6 suc-
cesses with this skill. If players specifically say they’re 
discussing long-term profit versus short-term gains, 
each such player gains a +4 bonus to that Diplomacy 
check (once only).
 
Nature (DC 31): The PCs point out areas into which 
the dragon can expand its territory away from the 
road: places where the guild and local governments 
would less likely pester it. On a successful check, 
they achieve 2 successes. They can achieve only 2 
successes with this skill. The dragon breaks off the 
challenge to investigate the claim. When it returns, 
every future check gains a +2 bonus until the PCs’ 
next failure.
 
Religion (DC 26): The PCs espouse the virtues of 
gathering wealth according to Tiamat’s doctrines and 
point out that the dragon wastes its time slaughtering 
the poor on the off chance of finding true wealth—
whereas the guild offers real payment. For each 
successful check, they achieve 1 success. They can 
achieve up to 3 successes with this skill. On a failure, 
the dragon counters with Tiamat’s doctrine that those 
who cannot defend their possessions do not deserve 
them; the PCs can make no further Religion checks, 
and every future skill check of any other sort in this 

49
C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
DRACONIC ENCOUNTERS
challenge takes a –2 penalty until the PCs achieve a 
success.
 
Other Skills: Bluff, Endurance, Intimidate.
Bluff (DC 28): The PCs exaggerate the benefits of 
the alliance. For each successful check, they achieve 
1 success. They can achieve up to 2 successes with 
this skill. On a failure, the dragon recognizes the lie; 
the PCs can make no further Bluff checks in this 
challenge, and they lose 1 success (if they have any).
Endurance (DC 20): The PCs take several hours to 
prove that travelers can pass through the dragon’s 
territory relatively quickly if the travelers don’t stop 
to rest; thus, travelers should not long disturb the 
dragon. If at least four PCs succeed on this check, 
they achieve 2 successes. They can achieve only 2 
successes with this skill.
Intimidate (DC 26): The PCs show off their epic 
abilities and imply that if the dragon does not agree 
to their request, they might have to clear the road 
the old-fashioned way. On a successful check, they 
achieve 1 success. They can achieve only 1 success 
with this skill. If the check fails or if the PCs attempt 
a second check, the dragon attacks.
Success: The dragon agrees to let guild caravans 
pass through its territory.
Failure: The characters do not obtain an agree-
ment. The guild must find another route or hire 
someone to kill the dragon.
 
If the PCs have fewer than 4 successes when they 
fail the challenge, the dragon later sends minions to 
attack them. If they have no successes when they fail 
the challenge, the dragon attacks.
Draconic Traps
Traps might not be a dragon’s best friend, but they’re 
certainly good companions. A lair without traps is 
like a dragon without teeth; it might still be danger-
ous, but it lacks—so to speak—bite.
 
Not all dragons lace their lairs with traps. Bestial 
varieties such as grays and whites might not bother, 
instead relying on their own abilities, slaves, and 
minions to protect their lairs. Others lack the knowl-
edge necessary to build such devices and have not 
captured someone to do it for them. Still, at least half 
of all draconic lairs have such safeguards. The older 
the dragon, the more likely it is to have at least a few 
lethal devices lying in wait.
 
Dragons use the classic standbys—rock falls, 
spikes, pits, and the like—as well as an array of their 
own inventions. Dragon traps include mystical 
elements, echoing the dragons’ elemental energy. 
Regardless of a trap’s origin, however, dragons look 
for a few specific traits and features in their home 
defenses.
Low and Slow: Dragons favor trapped floors and 
other traps that impede movement. A wyrm’s ability 
to fly allows it to leave such devices constantly active, 
without risk of triggering them by accident.
 
Compatible Damage Types: Whether with mag-
ical energy or with more mundane energy such as 
acid or alchemical fire, dragons like to employ traps 
that use the same sort of energy as their own breath. 
This situation ensures that a dragon’s own devices do 
not harm it, even if intruders trigger those devices 
while engaged in battle with the dragon.
 
Allies: Rather than leaving traps to do their 
jobs untended, many dragons fight alongside their 
devices. Such dragons choose traps that complement 
their own combat abilities, such as traps that render 
foes more vulnerable to the dragon’s abilities or that 
herd or guide intruders into precarious positions.
Sample Traps
The selection below describes a tiny fraction of the 
sorts of devices a dragon might employ (in addition 
to all those in the Dungeon Master’s Guide): two heroic 
and two paragon traps. For sample epic draconic 
traps, see “The Tomb of Urum-Shar” (page 142).
Golden Spines 
Level 5 Warder
Trap 
XP 200
The gold that glitters before your eyes seems suddenly to warp and 
twist. A brutal array of spines surges upward, gleaming like the 
treasure itself.
Trap: An array of spikes lies hidden among the coins of the 
dragon’s hoard, targeting a line of approximately 4 squares. The 
dragon has had the spikes smelted from its own gold and other 
precious metals to better conceal the trap and to make the 
treasure harder to steal.
Special: The 400 gold spikes are worth 1 gp each and count as 
part of the hoard’s value.
Perception
✦ DC 26: The character spots the tiny trigger wires hidden 
throughout the hoard.
Trigger
 
A character physically disturbs the hoard in any way or 
attempts to remove any items from it.
Attack
Immediate Reaction  
Melee
Target: All creatures in 4 contiguous squares
Attack: +9 vs. AC
Hit: 2d8 + 5 damage.
Eff ect: The treasure scatters. Any creature in a neighboring 
chamber hears this with a DC 15 Perception check.
Countermeasures
✦ An adjacent character can disconnect wires with a DC 17 
Thievery check, rendering one of the squares safe.
✦ An adjacent character can disconnect the entire web of wires 
with a DC 22 Thievery check, disarming the entire trap.
✦ A character can remove a single visible item from the hoard 
without triggering the trap, with a DC 14 Thievery check.
Failing in an attempt to use any of these countermeasures triggers 
the trap.
Upgrade to Elite (900 XP)
✦ Increase each skill DC by 2.
✦ Roll two attacks against each square.
✦ Increase spiked squares to 8 (for 800 spikes).

Ghoul Teeth 
Level 9 Lurker 
Trap 
XP 400
A faint click deep in the floor is the only warning as a swath of 
tiny projectiles shoots through slots in the flagstones. The missiles 
are discolored by some vile coating, and appear to be formed from 
humanoid teeth.
Trap: A number of hidden slots in the ﬂ oor, covering 
approximately 10 to 20 squares, launch tiny projectiles 
poisoned with a paralytic agent. Dragons frequently set these 
traps in open areas so that intruders remain vulnerable to their 
breath weapons.
Perception

Volatile Haze 
Level 12 Blaster
Hazard 
XP 700
The ground is all but hidden beneath a blanket of mist, rolling 
and waving less than 2 feet from the floor. When activated, the 
mist takes on a sickly bluish hue, somewhere between the flicker of 
the lightning and the fading edges of an ugly bruise.
Hazard: A volatile haze occasionally forms in an area of high 
mystical energy concentration, such as a dragon’s lair. A faint 
haze in a 10-square burst, hanging at roughly calf level on a 
human, absorbs the energy given off  by characters within it and 
then launches that energy back at those characters.
 
 When the hazard is triggered, it takes on a crackling blue 
hue, and a ball of energy forms in the square at the center of the 
burst. An active haze does not change damage types with future 
attacks or spells; it retains its initial type until deactivated or 
until 24 hours pass.
 
 A dragon fortunate enough to accumulate a volatile haze 
might wait until intruders have entered the haze and then 
breathe, knowing that the haze will continue to attack for it. 
Dragons even ﬁ ght within the haze, counting on their own 
resistance to protect them.
Perception
✦ DC 21: The character notices the faint haze near the ﬂ oor.
Additional Skill: Arcana
✦ DC 26: The character recognizes the mist for what it is.
Initiative +12 
Trigger 
 
A creature within the haze uses or is attacked by a cold, ﬁ re, 
lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder eff ect. The haze makes 
an attack instantly and then rolls initiative.

Target: All creatures in or adjacent to squares with haze
Attack: +13 vs. Reﬂ ex
Hit: 4d6 + 5 damage, and the target is dazed until the end of its 
next turn. Damage is the same type as that of the trigger eff ect.
Miss: Half damage, and the target is not dazed.
Countermeasures
✦ A character at the edge of the mist or in a targeted adjacent 
square when the haze attacks can attempt a DC 21 Acrobatics 
check as an immediate interrupt. If successful, that character 
takes half damage and immediately moves to the nearest 
untargeted square.
✦ A character can attack the ball of energy at the center of the 
haze, which has AC 23, Fortitude 23, Reﬂ ex 23, Will 23, and 87 
hit points and is immune to the damage type it uses to attack. 
If destroyed, the haze makes a ﬁ nal attack and then dies. It 
remains inert for 24 hours, after which time another energy 
attack can activate it.
Upgrade to Elite (2,400 XP)
✦ Increase each attack roll, and all defenses by 2.
✦ Increase HP to 130.
✦ Increase damage to 4d6 + 14.
Thief’s Curse 
Level 16 Blaster 
Trap 
XP 1,400
What appears to be a normal (if valuable) bit of artwork suddenly 
proves itself to be far, far more, as any would-be-thief slowly turns 
to gold at its slightest touch.
Trap: An object in the dragon’s lair that appears as an art item—
possibly a decoration, possibly part of the hoard—is in fact a 
mystical trap that causes those who trigger it to turn slowly 
to solid gold. A dragon that makes use of a thief’s curse might 
wait until intruders trigger the trap. If the dragon takes this 
approach, it hangs back just out of range, allowing the trap to 
do its work. Meanwhile, the dragon breathes and makes melee 
attacks against those who try to ﬂ ee.
Perception
✦ DC 25: The character notices the tiny runes etched on the art 
that indicate it has magical properties.
Additional Skill: Arcana
✦ DC 30: The character knows what the runes signify. The 
character must have detected or been shown the runes to 
attempt this check.
Initiative +16 
Trigger
 
A character disturbs the object that the trap protects.
Attack
Standard Action 
Area burst 2 within 10 squares
Target: All creatures in burst
Attack: +14 vs. Fortitude
Hit: 4d8 + 3, and the target is immobilized (save ends). On its ﬁ rst 
failed saving throw, an immobilized target is restrained. On its 
second failed saving throw, the target is petriﬁ ed. (The target 
becomes gold, but the gold corrodes into worthlessness within 
24 hours. This is normal petriﬁ cation in all other respects.)
Miss: Half damage, and the target is slowed until the end of its 
next turn.
Special: Destroying or deactivating the trap does not reverse 
petriﬁ cation, which requires the Remove Affl  iction ritual.

ADVENTURES
Although individual encounters with dragons are 
exciting, an entire adventure based around draconic 
encounters and themes is even more memorable. Not 
every encounter in such a campaign should involve 
a dragon—that sort of activity could become monoto-
nous and, in most cases, hard to justify. Rather, 
encounters might share a draconic theme, pit the PCs 
against minions of the dragon they must face at the 
adventure’s climax, or serve as waypoints on the path 
to the party’s eventual meeting with the wyrm.
 
When building a draconic adventure, keep the 
various aspects of the dragon’s persona and goals in 
mind. Decide what the dragon wants—why it is where 
it is—and build the encounter and plot accordingly. A 
dragon leaving its lair to hunt out of hunger behaves 
differently from one seeking to manipulate two 
nations into a war so that it might eventually loot the 
wreckage.
 
Remember that dragon-themed adventures need 
not revolve around the PCs fighting a dragon. An 
adventure could just as easily place the dragon on the 
same side as the PCs, working for mutual benefit or 
against a common enemy (see “Chromatic Patrons,” 
page 55). The PCs might even find themselves caught 
between two or more dragons in conflict with one 
another, forced to choose sides or to work against all 
with equal fervor.
 
An ambitious DM could mix and match these 
ideas, having a dragon begin as an enemy and later 
become an ally, or having a supposed ally betray the 
party. This  approach can work particularly well in 
ongoing dragon-themed campaigns (see page 57).
Adventure Hooks 
and Quests
The following hooks and plot seeds can form the 
basis for a variety of dragon-themed adventures. Use 
them as written, shake up the power levels, or take 
portions of the ideas to build your own. For DMs who 
wish to use these adventure hooks as quests, this 
section also provides suggestions on potential motiva-
tions, specific goals, and rewards.
 
The level notation in each title refers to the most 
potent dragon in the hook. Use it as a rough guide for

determining the levels of the encounters you include 
in your adventure. The XP rewards noted below 
assume five PCs.
False Witness (Level 5)
In the cold north, at the base of a broad mountainside 
covered with thick evergreen forests, a series of small 
villages once thrived. An economy based on lumber 
permitted trade with nearby communities and a 
lifestyle that, though far from lush, offered modest 
comfort. Now, however, a young white dragon that 
dwells on the mountain peak terrorizes the villages 
at regular intervals. Livestock and villagers disappear 
with alarming frequency, leaving behind nothing but 
pools of blood and sheets of ice. The villagers grow 
desperate. Unless the adventurers can save them, 
they will have to abandon their homes.
 
Although the scenario appears straightforward 
enough, the culprit behind these attacks is not the 
white dragon at all, but a mystically inclined young 
green dragon that dwells deep in the woods. This 
green wishes to expand its territory into a region cur-
rently claimed by the white, but it sees no reason to 
risk its own well-being in the process.
 
Through the use of some minor deception ritu-
als, the green dragon appears as a white wyrm. This 
dragon has laid siege upon the villagers, hoping that 
they will take action against the white dragon and 
leave the territory free for the green to claim. The 
plan also weakens the human communities, so the 
green might easily enslave them after the adventurers 
depart.
 
Quest Hook: The local inhabitants request or 
employ the PCs to eliminate the white dragon. They 
offer to pay some gold—not much, but whatever they 
can afford.
 
Alternatively, one of the PCs might have friends or 
relatives here and wish to take on the task unasked.
 
Quest XP: PCs who follow their quest to the letter 
and hunt down the white dragon without learning of 
the deception earn a minor quest reward of 200 XP. 
Later, they might learn of the green dragon’s subjuga-
tion of the villages they thought they saved.
 
PCs who discover the green dragon’s involvement 
and realize the white is innocent of this particular 
crime also earn a minor quest reward of 200 XP.
 
Quest Hook: Upon learning the truth, the villag-
ers ask the PCs to go after the green dragon. They 
cannot offer any additional reward.
 
Alternatively, after the PCs learn they’ve been 
duped, they might take on the task of defeating the 
green dragon without prompting, either out of a sense 
of justice or out of anger.
 
Quest XP: PCs who unravel the entire scheme and 
slay or drive off the green dragon earn a major quest 
reward of 1,000 XP.

52
C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
 
PCs who go on to drive away the white dragon, or 
at least convince it not to threaten the communities, 
earn a minor quest reward of 200 XP.
Out of the Dark (Level 7)
In the midst of an otherwise unrelated adventure, 
or perhaps during well-earned downtime, the PCs 
become the targets of a number of seemingly random 
attacks. Kobolds might attack one day, dragonborn 
the next. Even a few humanoid assassins might enter 
the picture. Initially, nothing obvious connects these 
assaults, but the fact that they keep coming should 
suggest to the PCs that something is amiss. An enemy 
seeks to destroy them, but who could it be? For that 
matter, as a low-level party, have they even had time 
to make any truly potent enemies?
 
Careful investigation—anything from the question-
ing of survivors to the discovery of documents written 
in Iokharic on the bodies of dispatched attackers—
eventually reveals a dragon as the common thread in 
all these encounters. The PCs should eventually trace 
the attacks to a specific young red dragon dwelling 
near an entrance to the Underdark. Written refer-
ences to meetings in a range of hills with deep caves 
might provide clues, as well as the fact that all attack-
ers carry uncut jewels or raw ore (as their payments 
from the dragon). The PCs might even allow survivors 
to flee and then follow them back to their employer.
Quest Hook: The PCs, growing tired of these 
random attacks, set out to learn the reason behind 
the attempts to kill them.
 
Alternatively, the government of the local com-
munity might demand that the PCs either find a way 
to halt these attacks or leave before any of the citizens 
come to harm.
Quest XP: PCs who learn the identity of the red 
dragon earn a minor quest reward of 300 XP. If the 
PCs learn its motivations and find a means of stop-
ping the attacks, they earn a major quest reward of 
1,500 XP.
 
To make this story work, you must decide why the 
dragon singles out the PCs. Do they have something 
it wants—perhaps something acquired in a prior 
adventure? Has one of them descended from a hero 
who slew the dragon’s mother? Does the dragon have 
reason to believe a prophecy that one of the PCs will 
thwart one of its schemes in later years? Whatever 
motive you choose, remember that it will drive not 
only this adventure but possibly future adventures.
Gathering Storm (Level 13)
Even in the dark wilderness that is the known world, 
with the sputtering lights of civilization few and far 
between, some regions harbor greater dangers than 
others. One such place is the Alkavanti Hills, a com-
bination of rolling hills and stretches of grassland 
that monsters have found a veritable playground. 
The area has also attracted adventurers seeking to 
pacify the land and to render the once-major high-
way safe again.
 
The adventurers seem finally to have succeeded. 
For months, traders who had to pass near the area 
have all arrived safely at their destinations. Orc 
tribes, chimeras, and stranger beasts that once men-
aced passersby in the Alkavanti have disappeared.
 
The region is quiet. Too quiet.
 
In fact, the monsters remain in the Alkavanti. An 
adult blue dragon gathers them, forcing them to coop-
erate with it and organizing them into ranks. With an 
army of monsters to do its bidding, the dragon plans 
to resume far more effective raids on travelers than 
they have previously known. It will also eventually 
threaten existing communities and more important 
trade routes.
 
Quest Hook: A patron or other powerful individ-
ual wants the PCs to recover a treasure said to lie in 
the Alkavanti Hills. He offers a pittance of a reward, 
because he, like others, now believes the region to be 
safe.
 
Alternatively, one of the PCs might have heard of 
the treasure (perhaps through a History check), and 
the party sets out to retrieve the treasure of their own 
initiative.
 
Quest XP: If the PCs retrieve the treasure despite 
unexpectedly strong resistance, they earn a major 
quest reward of 4,000 XP.
 
Quest Hook: The PCs seek to learn the reason 
for the sudden absence of monsters along the main 
road. They might do this out of their own curiosity, or 
one of the region’s petty nobles might want someone 
to check it out. The noble offers a modest reward, 
because he merely seeks information.
 
Quest XP: If the PCs learn that the blue dragon 
gathers the monsters into an army, they earn a minor 
quest reward of 800 XP. Clues the PCs find might 
include such discoveries as an orc military encamp-
ment more orderly than usual, or adjacent tracks 
of different kinds of creatures that normally do not 
travel together.
 
Quest Hook: After the locals learn the truth, they 
become desperate to find out the blue dragon’s plans 
and to stop those plans. They beg the PCs to do so. 
Local nobles offer a larger reward than they previ-
ously offered for the information—and another large 
reward if the PCs can stop whatever the dragon has 
planned.
 
Quest XP: Learning the dragon’s plans earns the 
PCs a minor quest reward of 800 XP. Fighting their 
way through to the dragon and stopping its schemes 
earns them a major quest reward of 4,000 XP.
 
You’ll need to decide the extent of the dragon’s 
plans. Does it intend merely to increase its wealth 
and influence, or does it have a more intricate pur-
pose for its army? Also, does the death of the dragon 
cause the army to disperse, or does something from 

53
C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
ADVENTURES
within the ranks step forward to take the dragon’s 
place? If the latter, the PCs do not earn the major 
quest reward until they truly stop the assembled 
monsters.
Shipwreck (Level 18)
This adventure begins with the PCs on a sailing 
vessel. (You decide the vessel’s precise nature and 
intended destination.) On a dark night, with weather 
poor but not too dangerous, a howling wind blows. 
From above, an elder gray dragon attacks, targeting 
not the people on deck but the ship’s mast and hull. 
The ship capsizes. The PCs survive in the cold water 
in the short term, after which they wash up on a 
nearby island.
 
Strangely for such a rapacious breed, the gray 
makes no effort to eat or kill any of the survivors. It 
continues to appear in the sky at intervals as though 
keeping an eye on the PCs and the sailors, but it does 
not attack unless they attack it first or attempt to leave 
the island.
 
After experiencing any other island encounters 
you choose to add, the PCs eventually discover an 
enormous face carved in the rock at the top of the 
highest hill. The carving shows signs of long-ago 
ritual use, suggesting that it is a religious idol. Tracks 
indicate to the knowledgeable that the dragon has 
knelt there multiple times.
 
Indeed, the dragon’s intent in attacking the ship 
was to offer those aboard as sacrifices.
Quest Hook: The sailors beg the PCs to protect 
them from the dragon and from the other hazards of 
the island.
Quest XP: Ten of the ship’s crew members make it 
to the island alongside the PCs. Each crew member 
who makes it back to civilization with the PCs is 
worth 1,000 XP, up to a total major quest reward of 
10,000 XP. Make sure that the island’s monsters and 
other dangers threaten the NPCs; the PCs must earn 
their quest reward by struggling to keep the crew 
alive.
Quest Hook: The PCs seek to learn the reason the 
dragon shipwrecked them and the reason it prevents 
their escape.
 
If the PCs’ curiosity does not suffice, the sail-
ors’ curiosity does: The sailors demand the PCs do 
something.
Quest XP: If the PCs discover the dragon’s con-
nection to the idol and recognize that the dragon 
worships the idol, they earn a minor quest reward of 
2,000 XP.
 
If the PCs can determine the power the idol rep-
resents, perhaps through investigation of hidden 
tunnels and shrines in the mountain, they earn 
another reward of 2,000 XP.
 
Decide what sort of deity, demon, or other spirit 
the idol represents when you decide to run this 
adventure. The idol could represent an old version 
of a known evil deity, such as Gruumsh, Torog, or 
Zehir. It might represent a demon lord, such as Orcus 
or Demogorgon. It could even represent a prince 
unknown to modern sages or an utterly alien entity. 
(Religion and History checks can inform the PCs 
of the information you wish them to have.) After 
you determine what the idol represents, decide 
why the dragon worships it. Has the dragon discov-
ered powerful magic in the idol? Has the dragon 
received a dream or visitation by a power seeking 
a likewise powerful servant? Or is the dragon mad, 
obsessed with an inanimate object devoid of any true 
meaning?
Crossfire (Level 22)
This adventure begins traditionally. In an area strewn 
with several towns and perhaps a city or two, mysteri-
ous deaths and disappearances are on the upswing. 
Livestock has been decimated. People have failed 
to arrive at their destinations along previously safe 
roads. The situation is the sort that cries out for an 
adventuring party. It might even seem a little old hat 
to an epic party—something that might have posed a 
challenge many years and levels ago. Now the party 
can deal with it easily.
 
Ah, the arrogance of high levels. . . .
 
In fact, the region has recently become the battle-
ground between a pair of elder dragons. A purple 
dragon has chosen to expand its territory upward, to 
encompass the nighttime surface directly above its 
Underdark domain. This enterprise has placed it in 
direct conflict with an elder red that dwells in the 
mountain caves and high peaks nearby.
 
Were the dragons to wage their conflict directly, 
the weaker purple dragon wouldn’t stand a chance. 
Instead, the purple has sent Underdark operatives 
to attack the area’s inhabitants—thereby depleting 
the red’s food sources of livestock and travelers. The 
purple has captured local villagers and pressed them 
into service as slaves or forced them to reveal aspects 
of the terrain and environment that might prove 
strategically useful. The purple has also sent thieves 
after the old weapons and items of several legend-
ary dragonslayers throughout the region and well 
beyond, planning to use those weapons and items in 
its struggle against the red.
 
With modification, you can use this adventure 
hook effectively as a sequel to the “Gathering Storm” 
hook presented previously. You might substitute the 
adult blue dragon in that adventure for the elder 
purple in this one (or vice versa), setting up events 
so that the PCs never encounter the dragon directly. 
Perhaps the PCs destroy one of the dragon’s agents 
and discover that other armies gather to even the 
odds in the blue (or purple) dragon’s efforts against 
the tougher red.

54

VINCENT DUTRAIT
Quest Hook: One of the local governments offers 
a reward for anyone who can learn the cause of the 
region’s troubles.
 
Alternatively, the PCs might have personal reasons 
for doing so, and thus investigate without promise of 
reward.
Quest XP: If the PCs learn that a dragon is behind 
the raids and disappearances, they earn a minor 
quest reward of 4,150 XP. If they learn that two drag-
ons are involved and in conflict, they gain a second, 
identical reward.
Quest Hook: Although the PCs can take on each 
dragon, doing so is dangerous. They might realize—or 
one of the local leaders might suggest—that they can 
resolve the situation in other ways.
Quest XP: If the PCs diplomatically broker an 
armistice that not only ends the current hostilities but 
guarantees no future outbreaks, or if they coax the 
purple into direct conflict with the red, thus weaken-
ing the loser so that they can take it out with little 
trouble, they earn a major quest reward of 20,750 XP.
But the Dead Dragons 
Shall Rule (Level 26 or 29)
The variable level depends on whether the PCs dis-
rupt the ritual before the dragon becomes a dracolich 
or after. This adventure works best if you seed hints 
of it into prior adventures: mysterious figures stealing 
magic items and rituals, sudden attacks as the black 
dragon wipes out the cult’s enemies, and so on.
 
Over the course of the past few months, a vile cult 
devoted to Orcus has been gathering mystical com-
ponents and living sacrifices for the rite to transform 
a living dragon into a dracolich. The cult even has a 
willing recruit: an ancient black dragon hungry for 
the extra power and immortality of undeath.
 
This is the sort of outcome PCs want to prevent. 
Multiple factions have their hands in this adventure, 
however, so the characters might need to decide with 
whom they want to work, if anyone.
 
The cult seeks not only to create the dracolich but 
also to create a phylactery with which it can com-
mand the creature’s obedience. The dragon knows of 
the phylactery and plots to sabotage its creation. Sev-
eral of the dragon’s agents within and outside the cult 
labor to replace components of the phylactery with 
fakes.
 
Locally, a church of Pelor has learned of the cult’s 
intentions and works to stop the plans. It is short 
on people and inexperienced with such problems, 
though. Its followers are as likely to get themselves 
killed or to put other innocents in danger as they are 
to succeed in their endeavors.
 
Finally, a dragon patron of the PCs has planted its 
own agent in the cult. This dragon seeks to ensure the 
completion of the ritual and then to abscond with the 

55
C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
ADVENTURES
phylactery and its agent. The turncoat cultist, having 
been involved in the ritual, will be able to use the 
phylactery to control the dracolich, granting the PCs’ 
patron dragon a truly potent servant.
Quest Hook: On behalf of any one of a number of 
factions, such as the church of Pelor, the PCs set out 
to discover the cult’s activities.
Quest XP: If the PCs learn that the cult of Orcus 
seeks to create a dracolich and has a willing subject, 
they earn a minor quest reward of 9,000 XP.
Quest Hook: The Church of Pelor seeks the PCs’ 
aid in stopping the rite and destroying the cult.
Quest XP: If the PCs halt the rite but fail to destroy 
the cult, they earn a minor quest reward of 9,000 XP. 
If they destroy the cult after the ritual is complete, 
they earn an identical reward. If they destroy the 
cult before it can complete the rite, they earn a major 
quest reward of 45,000 XP.
Quest Hook: The PCs’ dragon patron requests 
that they ensure the completion of the ritual and the 
escape of its agent with the phylactery.
Quest XP: If the PCs deliver both the agent and the 
phylactery to their patron, they receive a major quest 
reward of 45,000 XP.
Quest Hook: The PCs realize that they are run-
ning out of time or lack the strength to stop the 
ritual from commencing. They allow the dracolich to 
maintain its free will, keeping it out of the hands of 
the Orcus cult. They set out to aid the black dragon’s 
operatives in sabotaging the phylactery.
Quest XP: If the PCs have a hand in effectively sab-
otaging the phylactery, the PCs earn a minor quest 
reward of 9,000 XP.
Chromatic Patrons
Though the majority of chromatic dragons are 
vicious, predatory, or downright evil, some of them 
have no interest in harming others—at least not others 
wise enough to stay out of their way. Some prefer to 
live in peace, seeing such an existence as the easiest 
way to secure their own comfort. A rare few have 
streaks of altruism, seeking to use their great power 
and knowledge to aid others (though they welcome 
rewards for so doing; they’re still dragons).
 
Although such a dragon can act as a surprising ally 
in a single adventure, you might also consider involv-
ing one in a campaign as a patron for the PCs. Such 
a dragon behaves, in many respects, like any other 
patron: It offers aid, funding, or shelter; it points the 
party toward adventure and riches; and it provides 
them access to information or resources. In other 
respects, differences abound between (for example) 
patronage by a human knight in a castle and patron-
age by a green dragon in the depths of the Haunted 
Wood.
Missions and Endeavors
In most cases, a chromatic dragon acts as patron to 
adventurers for one of three reasons: to complete a 
task it considers menial or tedious, to do something it 
cannot do, or to complete a dangerous task. Examples 
follow.
The dragon thinks the objective is too unimportant 
or time-consuming for it to acquire or complete. Pos-
sibilities include:
✦ The retrieval of a treasure that the dragon covets 
but that has relatively little value.
✦Gathering of information about a community that 
encroaches upon the dragon’s territory but poses 
no real threat.
✦The humiliation of a major enemy.
✦The destruction of a minor enemy that is more a 
nuisance than a rival.
✦A long-term effort to spy on a government, orga-
nization, or church to which the dragon cannot 
devote the time.
✦Guarding the dragon’s agents or allies as they run 
errands between points of civilization.
The dragon cannot acquire or complete the objective 
itself. Possibilities include:
✦Retrieval of a prize from a family or community 
with which the dragon has sworn never to directly 
interfere.
✦Slaying of an enemy, or retrieval of a treasure, 
within a dungeon or location the dragon physically 
cannot enter, perhaps due to magical wards or size 
considerations.
✦Delivery of a message to a rival that would attack 
the dragon on sight.
✦Arrangement of a gathering with people who 
would never agree to a meeting with a dragon.
✦Manipulation of a ruler, merchant, or other indi-
vidual on guard against outside interference.
✦Acquisition of multiple treasures, multiple pieces 
of a treasure, or the components for a ritual within 
a limited window of opportunity.
The dragon thinks the objective poses too much 
danger for it to acquire or complete. Possibilities 
include:
✦Attack against a major rival the dragon thinks 
might overpower it.
✦Retrieval of a treasure, ritual, or secret from a dun-
geon or area the dragon considers too dangerous. 
(Certain infamous dungeons, such as the Tomb 
of Horrors or the Temple of Elemental Evil, might 
qualify.)
✦Acquisition of a prize the dragon is widely known 
to covet, thus revealing the dragon’s involvement.

Individual Patrons
Young dragons rarely become patrons. Most of them 
endeavor to establish their own bases of power, fear 
dealing with more powerful adventurers, or lack any 
understanding of how to contact, control, or manipu-
late people. Ancient dragons more commonly, but 
still rarely, become patrons. Ancients with an interest 
in minions already possess a pool of agents, opera-
tives, slaves, and even worshipers. Therefore, adult 
and elder dragons are the most likely dragons to act 
as patrons to adventurers. Gray and white dragons 
rarely become patrons.
 
Each entry below exemplifies a specific type of 
patron.
Kallahandros, Open Patron: An adult purple 
dragon, Kallahandros makes frequent use of adven-
turing parties as agents due to his lack of familiarity 
and comfort with the surface world. He makes no 
attempt to disguise his identity. He communicates 
with his agents either directly or through other min-
ions that have permission to identify their employer. 
He rarely deceives or withholds information from 
those who assist him unless he thinks he has no other 
choice. He would rather inspire loyalty, or at least 
grudging trust, than force or trick adventurers into 
serving his needs.
 
Kallahandros seeks to increase the size of his 
hoard and gather knowledge of the surface, particu-
larly of governments, tribes, and factions that operate 
near the entrances to his own Underdark domain. 
Rather than pay adventurers to perform tasks, he 
points them to existing treasures hidden in dungeons, 
requesting that they bring him a portion of each find. 
Although he does not engage in combat on behalf of 
his agents, he offers them occasional use of his cav-
erns as a refuge, in case the need arises for a place to 
hide or recover.
Tallasht, Hidden Patron: “Tallasht” might not be 
this elder blue dragon’s true name, but it is the only 
one he gives. Indeed, few people are even aware that 
she is a dragon. She has operatives active through-
out the world, but few as skilled as the adventuring 
parties to which she offers patronage. She employs 
adventurers to gather valuable treasures and to elimi-
nate threats or potential threats to his territories or 
political ambitions.
 
Tallasht, like other hidden patrons, rarely reveals 
her true nature. She most often communicates with 
adventurers through emissaries. Rumor has it that 
one of her agents sometimes claims to be her, so 
adventurers cannot lead an enemy to her location or 
reveal her identity. Beyond this basic ruse, however, 
she is only slightly more deceptive than an open 
patron. On occasion, she might omit details—such as 
details regarding the true power of magic items—but 
for the most part, she limits her deceits to lies neces-
sary to conceal her nature and identity.
 
Parotheon, Deceptive Patron: A significant 
minority of chromatic patrons fit their kind’s tradi-
tional mold. Deceptive patrons are evil. They keep 
only their own interests—and none of their agents’ 
well-being—at the heart of their schemes.
 
Like Tallasht, the adult green dragon Parotheon 
hides his true nature, making use of magic or emis-
saries for communication. Unlike Tallasht, however, 
he employs entirely dishonest methods. He sends 
operatives to acquire treasures but lies about the trea-
sures’ value or power. He promises to make efforts on 
his agents’ behalf and then doesn’t follow through. He 
employs multiple agents to complete the same task, 
increasing the likelihood that that one will succeed 
but also pitting them against one another. He causes 
adventurers to take inadvertent action against his 
nonevil enemies or to take on enemies too powerful 
for them.
 
Parotheon can only maintain these deceptions 
for so long, before his agents discover his web of lies. 
He then turns against the operatives or attempts 
to remain their patron by shifting to intimidation 
tactics.
 
Verexes, Intimidating Patron: Unlike the oth-
ers—even the deceptive patron, who hopes to create 
cooperation through lies—the elder brown dragon 
Verexes has no interest in convincing adventurers 
that they want to work with her. Instead, she forces 
them.
 
Convinced of her own strength and of her opera-
tives’ frailty, she demands obedience. She might 
threaten her coerced operatives directly, swearing to 
kill them if they don’t serve her. She might threaten 
their friends, their families, or unrelated innocents. 
She tells agents the minimum she thinks they need to 
know. If the agents fail, she presses someone else into 
service.
 
The intimidating patron is the most likely of all 
draconic patron archetypes to be truly evil. Even a 
deceptive patron might have semilegitimate reasons 
for lying, but only the vilest personality enforces 
obedience by threatening harm. Verexes cannot 
maintain control of an adventuring party indefinitely 
in this way, but she has no interest in forming long-
term relationships. She intends to abandon or kill her 
operatives after a few missions.
 
Although logic suggests that intimidating patrons 
should be the most common chromatic patrons, a 
wise DM is conservative with characters like Verexes. 
This sort of patron can quickly frustrate PCs. If the 
PCs must obey an intimidating patron, later give 
them the opportunity to escape its influence and seek 
payback, either on their own or perhaps with the aid 
of a new, rival patron. Alternatively, the PCs might be 
called upon to help a friend or acquaintance escape 
the influence of an intimidating patron.

DRACONIC CAMPAIGNS
Chromatic dragons can ultimately serve as the basis 
of entire campaigns. More than a series of dragon-
themed adventures strung together, a successful 
draconic campaign involves long-term schemes and 
efforts on the parts of the dragon (or dragons) and the 
PCs. At the conclusion of such a campaign, the players 
should feel a true sense of accomplishment, measured 
not only in the number of dragons overcome but also 
in the significance of the goals they have achieved—or 
have prevented enemies from achieving.
 
Although a draconic encounter or adventure can 
present a dragon as just a big, bad monster, a draconic 
campaign works best with dragons acting more like 
NPC villains. Each dragon should be more than just a 
ferocious opponent. It should have a name, a person-
ality, and goals. Even if the PCs never learn all these 
details, such details go a long way toward enabling you 
to portray the dragon richly. Such details also aid you 
in making decisions about how the dragon reacts to 
circumstances. (Fleshing out the details about drag-
ons works well in shorter adventures as well, because 
it makes dragons stand out against other monsters.)
 
As with any campaign that has an ongoing theme 
or plot line, not every session or adventure must 
revolve around dragons. Include nondraconic adven-
tures in a draconic campaign. Show other events 
happening in the world around the PCs, so that con-
frontations with dragons or draconic agents take on 
greater meaning. Feel free to change things up, regu-
larly and frequently.
 
Two campaign arc examples follow, showcasing 
ways to build a draconic campaign. Their broad 
strokes allow you to fill in the details or co-opt the 
concepts as you see fit.
Fabulous Dragonslayers
A campaign based on dragons in their traditional 
role—that is, as monstrous and malicious adversaries in 
desperate need of adventurers to wipe them out—can 
reveal the potential consequences of PCs becoming 
known as “the best there is at what they do.”
Heroic Tier: Rise Up
As the campaign begins, the PCs find themselves 
in a traditional adventuring environment: a region 
full of scattered villages and communities, the wilds 
between them crawling with an array of monsters. 
Indeed, the first few adventures betray little sense of 
a larger picture.
 
Slowly, the PCs come to realize that the seemingly 
unconnected monsters have a common connection. 
The lizardfolk tribe in the region’s far east seems 
prepared for the tactics the PCs used against the 
hobgoblin bandits in the north. Thieves that come 
after the PCs in town know exactly what items the 
PCs found in the last dungeon they explored—and 
the thieves attempt to steal only the most valuable of 
those items.
 
Rumors and gathered information reveal that only 
two kinds of people disappear from the main roads: 
the richest of travelers, and messengers sent to call 
for help from communities beyond. Other passersby 
continue in safety. Someone or something guides the 
efforts of the region’s monsters.
 
By questioning survivors, the PCs eventually learn 
of their enemy: Sulveras, an adult black dragon that 
has more or less ruled the region for decades. Some 
of the governing officials in the various towns know 
about him but elect to keep quiet, even paying him 
tribute and feeding him information to avoid risking 
overt attacks on their lands and people.
 
Still too weak to face Sulveras on their own, the 
PCs must travel the region seeking allies willing to 
oppose the draconic tyrant. Some allies might offer 
to aid them in combat. Others might provide refuge, 
information, magical aid, or funding.
 
As these activities progress, the dragon makes 
an appearance, terrorizing local communities in an 
effort to locate the PCs who have been interfering 
with its minions. Townsfolk might turn against the 
PCs, hoping that revealing them to the dragon will 
cause the beast to spare their homes and lives.
 
Finally, at the culmination of the heroic tier, the 
PCs have the might to confront Sulveras, putting an 
end to his reign of terror over the region and causing 
his minions to scatter to the four winds.
Paragon Tier: So Many Voices
For a time, the PCs enjoy their well-earned victory 
and engage in unrelated adventures. Eventually, how-
ever, as word of their victory against Sulveras spreads 
beyond the local region, their reputation as dragon-
slayers grows (perhaps magnified in the telling). They 
encounter new problems. People from distant lands—
well, relatively distant—come to them with every 
dragon-related complaint imaginable. Some tales are 
pure hysteria, perhaps spawned by the presence of 
giant lizards, wyverns, or hunting drakes. Other tales, 
however, might obligate good-hearted PCs to help all 
comers or might tempt mercenary characters with 
offers of rewards and opportunities to raid a dragon’s 
hoard. Between lesser adventures, the PCs might deal 
with the following three scenarios.
 
1. An adult gray dragon has taken up residence 
near Upper Whitewall, a small, independent city. 
The gray demands regular tribute—both gold and 
tasty citizens—from the city and has forged a pact 
with Upper Whitewall’s formerly unimportant guild 
DRACONIC CAMPAIGNS

58
C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
of thieves. Between the thieves’ guild and the dragon, 
the city’s coffers begin to dry up and its supply of 
convicts to offer to the dragon runs low. Soon it will 
have to start sacrificing innocent citizens to the 
beast. The PCs need not dig to discover the overt alli-
ance between the wyrm and the suddenly profitable 
guild, but they must find a way to deal with both.
 
2. King Olus of Phalanzia has grown terrified. (His 
kingdom is little more than a city-state with vassal 
towns a day’s travel from one another.) Several of his 
advisors have begun to act out of character, pushing 
for increased taxation and military action against 
neighboring communities. Sporadic sightings of a 
dragon in the region have led Olus to believe that a 
wyrm influences his court, and he has called upon 
the famous dragonslayers for assistance. In fact, a 
good-aligned dragon has worked behind the scenes of 
Phalanzia, unknown to Olus, for several generations, 
making the area better for both itself and the humans. 
The dragon recently sighted in the region, however, is 
an elder blue. It seeks to increase the king’s paranoia 
until he discovers and moves against the good dragon, 
leaving the region free for the blue to claim.
 
3. During the PCs’ latest few adventures, they 
have been beset by a series of seemingly unrelated 
attacks—from mercenaries, from living breaths (see 
page 228), from dragonborn, and from dragonspawn. 
It seems like the beginning of their careers all over 
again, with one vital difference: These attacks don’t 
target a given region, they target the PCs.
Epic Tier: You Asked For It
The PCs, with their reputation as dragonslayers, have 
attracted serious unwanted attention: that of Khostra-
Vokhan, an ancient red dragon and sacred knight of 
Tiamat. He has arranged the attacks on the charac-
ters as a means of testing them to learn their abilities 
and weaknesses. The ancient red intends to slaughter 
them in holy retribution for their actions against 
chromatic dragons, but first they must suffer.
 
The PCs’ first encounter with Khostra-Vokhan 
occurs when they are too weak to confront him 
directly. In the midst of a village or a city, the great 
wyrm attacks, destroying as much of the community 
as it can, just so he can reveal the PCs’ relative weak-
ness. At this time, the PCs can only save the lives of 
the residents caught in the destruction.
 
During their next few adventures, the PCs learn 
more of this new terror. Khostra-Vokhan makes no 
effort to hide his nature or identity, so the PCs might 
learn his name from any of the monsters he sends 
after them, or from sages who have heard of him, or 
through ritual divinations. They might also seek out 
allies or magic items to aid them in their struggle.
 
The dragon attacks several more times in this 
manner, striking near but not directly at the party. He 
sends more minions after the PCs themselves. An ally 
of the characters—perhaps the good-aligned dragon 
from earlier in the campaign—eventually offers them 
refuge in a place where Khostra-Vokhan cannot find 
them. The ally also provides the PCs with knowledge 
of the red dragon’s lair, allowing them to seek out their 
enemy when they grow powerful enough. Finally, they 
put an end to him once and for all.
The Dragon’s Hand
The previous campaign arc places dragons in their 
standard role. This one involves the PCs in long-term 
cooperation with a dragon. Initially as a patron, later 
as a more direct ally, the dragon demonstrates that 
not all chromatics are evil.
 
The campaign does have its fair share of draconic 
villains, however. After all, nothing makes a better 
common enemy for an adventuring party and a 
patron dragon than another, more powerful wyrm. . . .
Heroic Tier: 
A Mysterious Patron
After a few successful early adventures, an emissary 
of someone named Tallasht (see page 56) approaches 
the PCs. The emissary claims that he has learned 
of the PCs’ accomplishments and told his employer 
about them. His employer, impressed with what he 
has described, would like to pay the PCs to retrieve 
an ancient book located within the library of a 
ruined, abandoned castle. The PCs need only bring 
the emissary’s employer the book and ten percent of 
any other treasures gained. The rest of the treasure is 
theirs to keep—and there is plenty of it. Tallasht would 
also like to meet the characters and consider further 
patronage, if their first job goes well.
 
Only if the PCs agree does the emissary offer them 
directions to the ruins of which he speaks. He also 
describes the book, written in Iokharic and bound in 
the tanned hide of a rage drake.
 
In the fallen castle, the PCs face a variety of mon-
sters that have moved into it and its dungeons. The 
party eventually finds a valuable hoard, the book 
included. If any of the PCs read Iokharic, they dis-
cover that the book is a sage’s biography of a number 
of dragons hundreds of years gone.
 
Returning with the book, the PCs meet an agent 
of Tallasht, seeming to be a human knight who rules 
a small territory from a well-fortified keep. “Lord 
Tallasht” congratulates the PCs on their success and 
explains that he would like to serve as their patron. 
He offers them an occasional safe refuge, short-term 
loans, and—most important—directions to riches and 
magic they otherwise could not find. In exchange, he 
requests ten percent of all treasures they find, as well 
as the right to send them on occasional missions. If 
questioned about his motives, he explains that he seeks 
to enrich and strengthen his holdings and to defend 
against enemies who would see his lands destroyed.

ERIC DESCHAMPS
DRACONIC CAMPAIGNS
 
Tallasht suggests or requests several of the PCs’ 
otherwise unrelated adventures that follow. Most of 
them involve the recovery of magic weapons, but in 
a few instances the characters must eliminate poten-
tially dangerous creatures, such as the leader of a 
gnoll tribe or the leader of a human cult of Tiamat. 
Eventually, through questioning or eavesdropping, 
the PCs learn that several of these enemies serve 
someone or something called Virrikai.
 
If any PCs read through the book on dragons 
before turning it over to Tallasht, they recognize “Vir-
rikai” as the name of a brown dragon that was young 
a few hundred years ago. If none of them read the 
book, they can learn this information by consulting 
a sage. Also, in the dungeons and ruins that Tallasht 
sends the PCs to explore, allow the PCs to make 
Perception checks to notice dragon tracks and other 
clues of a dragon’s recent presence.
 
In case these measures aren’t enough to demon-
strate Tallasht’s involvement with dragons—and to 
reveal that she hasn’t told them the entire truth—an 
adult brown dragon soon attacks the PCs. They real-
ize that the brown is far from home and too young to 
be Virrikai. They struggle in the battle but should be 
at a level just high enough to overcome the dragon.
Paragon Tier: 
Welcome to the War
For a time, the PCs cannot make contact with “Lord 
Tallasht.” He has vanished.
 
After the PCs experience several unrelated adven-
tures, the emissary from their earlier adventures 
again approaches them. He explains that the person 
they knew as Tallasht has been slain and that it is 
time for them to meet their true employer.
 
Helping the PCs fight off several attacks on the 
way, the emissary leads the PCs to the blue dragon 
Tallasht’s lair deep in the hills of a rainy highland 
region. After assuring the PCs that she means them 
no harm, Tallasht explains that she had hoped to keep 
her involvement secret, for her protection and theirs. 
She reveals that, for centuries, several rival families of 
dragons have warred over the region, working primar-
ily but not entirely through agents and dupes rather 
than risking their lives fighting each other directly.
 
She explains that her rivals are two ancient drag-
ons, the gray Qumasthes and the brown Virrikai, 
both far more powerful than she. Although she 
admits that she places more value on her own life 
and on the lives of her hatchlings than she places on 
the lives of humanoids in the region, she claims that 
if Qumasthes and his clan of grays win the conflict, 
all the communities will become nothing but dragon 
hunting grounds. If Virrikai proves dominant, he will 
attempt to transform the region into his domain. It is 
therefore in everyone’s best interest if the PCs con-
tinue to allow Tallasht to serve as their patron.
 
Tallasht’s interaction with the PCs becomes more 
open from this point. They still have time for several 
unrelated adventures, but she frequently points the 
PCs toward agents and followers of the other dragons, 
or requests that they find ever more powerful magic 
for use against their rivals when the day of reckoning 
finally comes. Between fighting the powerful minions 
of Qumasthes and Virrikai, and surviving assassina-
tion attempts sent in return, the PCs should advance 
to the epic tier with alacrity.
Epic Tier: Endgame
Concerned by the PCs’ successes against their min-
ions, Qumasthes and Virrikai briefly put aside their 
differences to concentrate their efforts. Marshaling 
their forces, they wipe out many of Tallasht’s allies 
and operatives in the local communities and tribes. 
Tallasht, in turn, ups the ante further, requesting that 
the PCs go after Virrikai himself. She explains that 
Virrikai is easier to find and less powerful than Qum-
asthes. Further, Virrikai is the more organized of the 
two. If he falls, Qumasthes might have difficulty con-
trolling both armies.
 
The PCs’ greatest adventure to date involves track-
ing Virrikai to his lair, fighting their way through his 
forces, and slaying him. Upon killing Virrikai, they 
still aren’t through with him: After another adven-
ture or two, Virrikai’s children, a pack of elder brown 
dragons, seek vengeance.
 
Although the PCs survive, they suffer a great loss. 
While they were killing Virrikai, the vile Qumasthes 
was slaughtering Tallasht.
 
Tallasht’s hatchlings have survived, having 
hidden in secret caves throughout the lair. They 
describe their terror as the ancient gray tore apart 
their mother and her soldiers. They beg the PCs to 
continue the task set to them: to destroy Qumasthes 
before he and his clan of gray dragons consolidate 
their dominance of the region.

60
C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
 
The final challenge of the campaign is up to the 
PCs. Do they dig in, take command of Tallasht’s 
surviving allies, and wait for Qumasthes to come to 
them? Do they try to hunt him as they did Virrikai? 
Do they pretend to flee, luring Qumasthes and his 
offspring to chase them down?
 
Assuming the PCs are victorious, none of the com-
peting dragons remain except Tallasht’s hatchlings. 
The hatchlings, completing the circle that began at 
the start of the campaign, ask the PCs to become 
their patrons, protecting them until they grow older 
and teaching them the ways of the world. This, 
perhaps, is the final epic victory of an adventuring 
party—not the slaying of dragons, but the shaping 
of the next generation, ensuring that blue wyrms in 
years to come will truly prove friends, not foes, to all.
DRAGON HOARDS
Fighting dragons is not for the faint of heart. It’s nasty 
work, and taking on a dragon in its lair might be the 
last thing a would-be hero will ever do. With the 
power a dragon has at its disposal, one might wonder 
why an adventurer would bother squaring off against 
such a terror when fighting goblins and orcs are far 
easier prey. The reason is simple: the dragon’s hoard.
 
Dragon hoards are legendary in the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game world with good reason. Of all the 
vaults player characters plunder, of all the monsters 
they defeat, none of them grants the reward that 
defeating a dragon does. A dragon’s hoard is a thing of 
beauty: piles of fabulous coins, priceless jewelry, chests 
heaped near to bursting with precious gemstones, 
weapons, armor, and long-lost magic items. A hoard 
excites the senses, sparks the imagination, and pro-
vides a thrill equal to the vicious fight with the dragon. 
The treasure that makes up even the lowliest dragon’s 
hoard is enough to keep a commoner comfortable for 
the rest of his days, while the larger hoards of great 
wyrms and ancient dragons could give a mortal coin 
enough to purchase a small kingdom. With all that 
tempation, it’s no wonder fools and heroes alike test 
their mettle against these creatures of legend.
Dragon Hoard 
as Terrain
A dragon’s hoard can be just what it seems—a pile of 
gold and items that will keep the PCs well stocked 
until their next adventure. However, a dragon’s hoard 
can be as much of a hazard as a deadly trap or as 
beneficial as a healing font. A hoard might interfere 
with movement, slash at foes that stumble into it, or 
make fighting atop of slippery gold coins a significant 
tactical error. These possibilities offer obstacles and 
provide advantages to make the battle in the dragon’s 
lair as memorable as facing the dragon itself.
DRAGON HOARDS
DRAGON HOARDS
AGON HOARDS
DRAGON HOARDS
 
Adding fantastic terrain elements to a dragon’s 
hoard does not affect the monetary value of the 
hoard, nor does it alter or modify any of the magic 
items. Instead, the dragon’s hoard and its unusual 
effects can be a result of the treasure’s composi-
tion. A stockpile of gold coins could interfere with 
movement, while a highly polished shield might tem-
porarily blind a character standing nearby.
 
Size and Space: For the purpose of placing fan-
tastic treasure hoards, assume that a treasure hoard 
covers 1 square for every 10,000 coins present. Addi-
tional items such as piles of weapons, armor, and 
large valuables can take up additional room. Dragons 
like to look at beautiful, interesting, or intriguing 
things from different perspectives, so arrange the 
hoard around the lair, placing the terrain as needed 
to make the combat engaging.
Fantastic Terrain Types
Come up with one of your own design or select a fan-
tastic feature that works best with the treasures in the 
hoard from among those that follow. A hoard should 
have no more than one fantastic terrain quality per 
tier (one for a heroic tier hoard, two for paragon, and 
three for epic).
 
Combustibles: Some treasures are flammable. 
These include paper, scrolls, furs, and precious 
woods—in addition to such items as furniture, 
wagons, and carriages. All of those can go up in 
flames. Whenever treasure in a square of this terrain 
type is in the area of a close or area attack power that 
has the fire keyword, it automatically catches fire. 
Characters starting their turns in a space adjacent to 
flaming treasure take 5 fire damage at the heroic tier, 
10 fire damage at the paragon tier, or 20 fire damage 
at the epic tier. Combustible treasures are destroyed 
when they burn. In addition, the combustion creates 
smoke, lightly obscuring the area within 2 squares 
of it. The fire and smoke persist until the end of the 
encounter, though a character can extinguish the 
flames in 1 square with a standard action to smother 
them.
 
Dazzling Treasure: A mirror, shield, or other 
shiny surface reflects and intensifies light shined 
upon it so that those nearby are temporarily blinded 
by its brightness. A character ending his or her move-
ment in a square adjacent to dazzling treasure and 
within the area of a light source is blinded until the 
start of his or her next turn.
 
Distracting Prisoner: A dragon’s incredible 
charisma and the sheer terror it inspires can unravel 
the minds of those it holds prisoner. Some just weep 
and gibber, but a few come to see the dragon as their 
friend, protector, and champion, in spite of the fact 
that the dragon will most likely eat them eventu-
ally. So deluded are these fools that they might try to 
hamper or distract their would-be rescuers.

WARREN MAHY
DRAGON HOARDS
 
The first character to start his or her turn in a 
square adjacent to a distracting prisoner takes a –1 
penalty to speed. Wherever the character goes, the 
deluded prisoner attempts to cling to the character 
and follow him. An affected character can escape the 
prisoner, leaving the prisoner standing where it is and 
removing the speed penalty, by succeeding on a DC 
10 Strength check as a standard action. Otherwise, 
the speed penalty lasts until the end of the encounter 
or until the prisoner is slain.
Dragon-Cursed: Dragon-cursed treasure car-
ries the maliciousness of its owner to such an extent 
that anyone that handles as much as a gold piece 
falls under a mild curse. A character in possession of 
dragon-cursed treasure while the dragon still lives 
takes a –2 penalty to all defenses until he or she dis-
cards the tainted item (throws it away to no benefit) 
or has a Remove Affliction ritual performed on him 
or her.
Shifting Piles and Slippery Coins: Loose coins 
can be treacherous to move through, since they create 
unstable footing. Each square containing treasure 
counts as difficult terrain. In addition, the dragon 
gains a +5 bonus to Perception checks made to hear 
intruders when they enter a square containing the 
treasure.
Vicious Treasure: As wondrous as a hoard can 
be, it can also be dangerous. Caches contain weap-
ons, armor, and other sharp objects that can snag 
and cut the unwary. Any character who enters a 
square containing vicious treasure takes 5 damage at 
the heroic tier, 10 damage at the paragon tier, or 20 
damage at the epic tier.
Principles of 
Hoard Design
Generating a dragon’s hoard can be as simple as writ-
ing down the number of gold pieces and picking a 
few items, but such a strategy is rarely rewarding for 
players who have risked their characters’ lives and 
limbs to defeat the dragon. Indeed, PCs deserve a bit 
more than a humdrum pile of gold (or platinum or 
astral diamonds). Given how important dragons are 
to D&D, their treasures ought to have as much char-
acter as the dragons have themselves.
 
A dragon’s hoard is an impressive thing, not only 
for the accumulated wealth, but also as a window into 
the psychology of the dragon that claims it. A hoard 
includes those things the dragon has found, had been 
offered as tribute by terrified mortals, or has taken 
by force. In all, the dragon’s hoard is representative of 
what the dragon likes, what it values, and fundamen-
tally, what interests it. Dragons are bound to pick up a 
few random oddities along the way, but to keep such 
items in its hoard, the dragon has to live with the item, 
has to look upon it, cherish it, brag about it, and, of 
course, jealously guard it every day of its extended life.
 
To build an interesting dragon hoard, consider 
each of the aspects discussed below.
History
From the moment a dragon strikes out on its own, 
it begins hoarding treasure. The dragon has in its 
hoard treasures acquired throughout decades if not 
centuries, including items from a variety of cultures 
and civilizations that might no longer exist. As well, 

62
C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
a dragon can have acquired treasures that were old 
already when a dragon came into possession of them, 
and so a dragon’s hoard offers a glimpse into the his-
tory of the region, highlighting the major movements 
of civilization in the hoard’s precious objects, old 
coins, and magic items present.
Consistency
A dragon values its hoard and is unlikely to leave it 
unguarded for long. So when a dragon goes search-
ing for food and wealth to add to its hoard, it doesn’t 
stray too far from its lair. As a result, the treasure one 
might find is likely to originate from lands only as far 
away as the dragon can fly in a single day.
 
That said, dragons might receive offerings from 
their neighbors, local humanoids who seek to appease 
the monster, disturbed cultists giving up their trea-
sures as sacrifices, or possible allies bestowing gifts to 
cement an alliance. Since these gifts must be valuable 
to garner the dragon’s goodwill, a few items can origi-
nate from far-off lands.
Appropriateness
A black dragon’s hoard in a cave sunken in a hillock 
in a stinking bog is not likely to include valuable 
bolts of cloth, books, paintings, scrolls, or anything 
else that’s not likely to last in such a sodden place. It’s 
more like to hold gemstones, fine statuary, pillars, 
and other goods that can withstand a little dampness. 
It might seem obvious, but thinking about what’s 
likely to survive in a dragon’s lair goes a long way 
toward maintaining suspension of disbelief.
 
On the other hand, an item found in a dragon’s 
hoard that has no business being there stands out as 
being important. A beautiful tapestry hanging on the 
wall of a volcanic lair isn’t going to last long, and so its 
presence suggests that the dragon recently acquired 
the item, which might mean that the item has more 
value to its original owner than merely as an art 
object likely to be sold outright. Distinctive items and 
unusually placed items are great ways to seed future 
quests, drop hints about an ongoing mystery, or fore-
shadow a future adventure.
Character
More than anything else, you should consider the 
dragon’s personality, its ambitions, fears, and quirks 
when designing its hoard. An especially pious dragon 
might collect religious paraphernalia, while a sinister 
dragon known to consort with demons could have 
debased interests and collect rare pieces of torture 
equipment, bronzed halflings, and a large assort-
ment of unicorn horns. When you’re determining the 
monetary valuables in a hoard, come up with at least 
three things to reflect the unique nature of a dragon’s 
personality and interests and seed them into the 
goods and items included in the hoard.
Diversity
Fundamentally, a hoard is a quantity of coins and 
magic items. When you get right down to it, the 
hoard represents an expected value of gold pieces 
and the appropriate number of magic items to keep 
the PCs properly outfitted as they make their way 
through their next adventure. This approach, while 
fine in theory, is rather soulless. The treasure should 
stand out as much as the dragon does. 
 
Diversity means spreading out the monetary value 
of the treasure among coins, art objects, gemstones, 
trade goods, the amusing or puzzling oddity, and 
even the rare valuable prisoner. First off, sameness is 
boring. A pile of coins and nothing else is dull, dull, 
dull. Variety in and of itself begins to make a hoard 
memorable. It also gives characters the opportunity 
to select concrete and distinctive souvenirs amid the 
hoard to help them remember their triumph—or to 
pick out knockout jewelry to adorn themselves at a 
future formal ball.
 
Injecting diversity into a hoard gives your players 
a chance to connect with the campaign setting and 
ground themselves in the game world. Certainly, 
the PCs can liquidate the items into coins. That is 
well and good, and you should not make exchanging 
the hoard into money an onerous task, or make the 
players feel “cheated” by trapping all the value of the 
hoard in material goods that they cannot change into 
cash. However, finding a buyer for a disturbing paint-
ing or returning a captured prince to a distraught 
mother offers opportunities to plant adventure seeds 
that can grow into minor and major quests. Perhaps 
the ceramic urn with the intricate flower pattern 
recovered from a purple dragon’s grotto is in fact the 
critical component to putting an angry ghost to rest. 
Or the bejeweled longsword discovered in a darkened 
corner might be the key to bringing peace between 
two warring city-states. A dragon’s hoard is a perfect 
resource for setting the stage for future scenarios.
Creating 
Dragon Hoards
Dragons are mighty opponents, foes of significant 
power and might. A dragon can tackle an entire party 
by itself and stands a good chance of surviving the 
encounter. As if the dragons’ own powers weren’t 
enough, their lairs are anything but friendly. Dragons 
seek out the nastiest, most inhospitable places to live. 
Numerous thralls and parasites lurk about their caves, 
and tricky traps, dangerous terrain, and other haz-
ards can make a descent into a dragon’s lair as nasty 
as fighting the dragon. For these reasons, defeating a 
dragon and claiming its hoard is a considerable feat 
and one that merits a commensurate reward.
 
A dragon’s hoard is different from most other 
treasure in that the items are more interesting and

DRAGON HOARDS
varied. Creating a hoard that engages the player 
characters can be a challenge. This section provides 
tools to help you build a hoard worthy of gracing a 
dragon’s lair. 
1. Select Parcels: Select at least one magic item 
and a number of monetary treasure parcels (see 
“Treasure Parcels,” Dungeon Master’s Guide, pages 
126—129). A dragon hoard should consist of at least 
three parcels of treasure. It can include up to five par-
cels, depending on the dragon, its environment, and 
any other challenges related to the fight against it. If 
you have a group of more than six players, consider 
adding an extra magic item or monetary parcel to the 
hoard for every two characters above five. Conversely, 
subtract a monetary parcel from the hoard if the 
group numbers three or fewer.
Magic Item Parcels: Your dragon hoard should 
have at least one magic item parcel. You can include 
as many as three, but it’s a good idea to use at least 
one magic item parcel in some other encounter or 
encounters at the current level to give the PCs more 
firepower when they finally square off against the 
dragon.
Monetary Parcels: Your dragon hoard should have at 
least one monetary treasure parcel, and two is a good 
baseline.
Potions: Since a fight with a dragon is tough, it’s 
best if the adventurers have potions prior to the battle 
with the dragon. The dragon hoard might have one 
potion, but it’s perfectly fine for it to not have any at 
all. If you want to put potions into a hoard, deduct 
the value of the potions you add from the coins in the 
hoard.
2. Determine Combined Monetary Value: 
Instead of using the monetary treasure parcels 
exactly as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, 
combine the value of the monetary parcels you have 
selected into one monetary treasure value.
3. Assign Monetary Treasure Types: Using the 
monetary treasure value budget you have created, 
assign parts of that total value to coins, gemstones, art 
objects, luxury items, oddities, and trade goods (and 
potions, if you wish). You can do this in whatever way 
works best for your campaign. Luxury items, oddities, 
and trade goods are discussed later in this section.
 
Alternatively, you can use the Monetary Treasure 
Types by Level table below to assign amounts to the 
different types of monetary treasure in the hoard.

Example: Derek is making a dragon hoard for his 
group of five 18th-level characters. He wants this 
hoard to contain a high-level magic item and a lot of 
money, since the battle with the dragon is the end of 
a spectacular series of encounters. He picks parcels 1, 
5, and 9:
✦ Magic item, level 22
✦ 48,000 gp
✦ 15,000 gp
The total combined monetary parcel value is 63,000 
gp. Derek decides to use the Monetary Treasure 
Types by Level table rather than selecting treasure a 
la carte.
 
So, the dragon hoard is going to have these magic 
items and this monetary treasure, by type. Each of 
the following sections discusses each type of mon-
etary treasure in detail.
✦ Magic item, level 22
✦ 22,050 gp of coins
✦ 18,900 gp of gemstones
✦ 12,600 gp of art objects
✦ 3,150 gp of luxury and adventuring goods
✦ 3,150 gp of oddities
✦ 3,150 gp of trade goods
 
4. Define Items: Pick a magic item or items from 
the Player’s Handbook (or other sources of magic item 
information) based on the parcels you have selected. 
Remember to tailor these magic items to your charac-
ters. You might want to review any wish lists you have 
collected from your players concerning items they’d 
like to have for their characters (see “Awarding Trea-
sure,” Dungeon Master’s Guide, page 125).
 
Define the items in the kinds of monetary treasure 
you’ve assigned. The sections on Coins, Gems, Art 
Objects, Luxury and Adventuring Items, Oddities, 
and Trade Goods provide ways to flesh out the gen-
eral monetary treasure kinds with details that infuse 
the hoard with history, consistency, appropriateness, 
and character.
 
In defining the monetary treasure, you might find 
that the treasure guidelines leave you with small 
remainders. For instance, each of the gems in a 
paragon tier hoard should be worth at least 500 gp. 
However, with 18,900 gp to allocate in gemstones, 
you end up with 400 gp left over that’s not enough to 
accommodate another 500 gp gem. Throw leftover gp 
amounts back into coins.
 
Example: Derek picks a +5 vicious longsword as the 
level 22 magic item in the magic item parcel, since 
the player of the fighter in his campaign mentioned 
that item in his wish list.
 
5. Assess the Hoard for Space and Tactical 
Placement: Treasure takes up space. A storehouse 

64
C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
of 500 casks of dwarven ale doesn’t just appear at 
the end of the combat. It occupies a place in the lair. 
Think about where the dragon keeps its stuff and how 
much space it takes up. As a general rule, assume 
each square can hold 10,000 coins, two chests, four 
sacks, two crates, or one larger object such as a pillar, 
statue, or prisoner. Be sure to place these items in the 
lair at the start of the combat since treasure, as shown 
earlier, can sometimes have an effect on the combat’s 
outcome.
Example: Derek’s hoard is going to take at least 2 
squares for just the coins. He figures between that 
and the other items in the hoard, it’s going to take 
up 4 squares. He chooses a place on the map, noting 
what’s in each square. After those 4 squares are 
placed, he’s done.
Coins
The idea of a dragon hoard brings to mind a big pile 
of coins. The most prevalent and essential component 
of a hoard is cold, hard cash. Whether kept in sacks 
and chests or scattered across the floor, coins are a 
staple. For all their ubiquity, coins are sometimes the 
least exciting component of a hoard. Use some or all 
of the following methods to make coins stand out.
Denominations: One way to inject diversity and 
character into the coins is to mix up the denomi-
nations. A dragon appreciates gold, but there’s no 
reason why your dragon wouldn’t also have silver and 
copper, or, for higher tier adventures, platinum and 
astral diamonds among its loot. A particular dragon 
might prefer gold and copper, or silvery coins such as 
platinum and silver, or coins in the form of strands of 
astral diamonds.
 
What amount should you convert? Decide based 
on the flavor of the hoard (history, consistency, appro-
priateness, character). Then, assess the amount of 
space that the coins are going to take up. The space 
taken up by low-denomination coins will cause the 
volume of the hoard to balloon upward. Be aware 
of that space constraint and the feel of the coin mix. 
Don’t let the number of low-denomination coins over-
whelm the mix, or the coins will start to feel bloated 
and trivial.
 
Example: Derek’s hoard starts with 22,050 gp in 
coins. He decides to change many of those gold pieces 
into platinum pieces (roughly 50% of the total value) 
and some of the gold pieces into silver pieces (roughly 
5% of the total value), because the dragon has col-
lected a mixture of coins that are in accordance with 
each denomination’s frequency. (There are more 
silver coins in circulation than gold coins, and fewer 
platinum coins in circulation than gold coins.) The 
coins now consist of:
✦ 110 pp
✦ 9,947 gp
✦ 11,030 sp
COIN DENOMINATION ASSORTMENTS BY TIER
Heroic: Copper, silver, gold
Paragon: Silver, gold, platinum
Epic: Gold, platinum, astral diamonds
Rare and Foreign Coins: It makes sense for 
some of the coins in a dragon’s possession to be older 
than others. Some might originate from ancient and 
long-lost kingdoms whose people have changed, been 
absorbed, or even been made extinct through war, 
disease, or calamity. Old coins can point the way to 
future adventures, suggesting nearby hoards perhaps 
plundered by the dragon or other adventurers who 
had the misfortune of encountering the dragon. Such 
coins might hold a slightly higher value, and PCs who 
seek out buyers and collectors could exchange them 
for 10% or more of the coin’s value.
 
If you raise the individual value of a coin, reduce 
the total monetary coin value to compensate. It’s 
important to note that most people judge the worth 
of a coin by its purity and not by its age, so the extra 
value tied to each coin only holds true if the PCs find 
someone willing to buy it.
 
In addition to seeding coins of exceptional value 
inside a hoard, you can also insert currency of foreign 
or exotic mint. Undoubtedly, coins from far-flung 
lands, of strange shapes or stamped with unusual 
images, are likely mixed in with the more common 
sorts of coins. Such foreign coins can hint at an unex-
plored land, a distant place previously thought to be 
the stuff of legend, all of which are the makings for 
exciting expeditions into the unknown.
SHORTCUT HOARD
Select magic items and monetary parcels as described in 
the Dungeon Master’s Guide® (pages 126—129). Pick one 
magic item parcel and two monetary parcels appropriate 
to the character level. Here’s a set of quick picks:
✦ Parcels 3, 7, and 10: Low magic, low money.
✦  Parcels 2, 6, and 10: Moderate magic, moderate 
money.
✦ Parcels 1, 5, and 9: High magic, high money.
✦ Parcels 1, 7, and 10: High magic, low money.
✦ Parcels 3, 5, and 9: Low magic, high money.
 
Now assign those parcels exactly as described in the 
Dungeon Master’s Guide.
 
Hoards built from these quick picks are still modest, 
even though some are described as “high magic” or “high 
money.” If you are trying to make the hoard of all hoards, 
add more parcels. Just be aware of the effect doing that 
will have on the cash flow of the campaign.

DRAGON HOARDS
RARE AND FOREIGN COINS
Arkhosian gold talon (ancient dragonborn empire)
Bael Turathan gold triam (ancient tiefling empire)
Cendriane platinum crescent (ruined eladrin empire)
Nerathan gold crown (fallen human empire)
Zannadian platinum ouroboros (vanished yuan-ti empire)
Gems
If there’s something dragons love as much as gold, it’s 
gemstones. Like trade bars, precious gems hold their 
value and function just like currency. Adventurers 
favor gems because they’re easy to transport, allowing 
them to carry all their treasure without hauling bags 
of silver and gold coins.
 
The Dungeon Master’s Guide describes four 
common values for gemstones, so when gemstones 
come up when generating the loot, pick a gem that 
comes closest to the pile’s worth, and make up any 
shortages or overages from other areas.
GEMSTONES
100 gp 
Amethyst, bloodstone, carnelian, chalcedony, 
 
citrine, rock crystal, garnet, iolite, jade, jasper, 
 
jet, moonstone, onyx, pearl, peridot, smoky 
 
quartz, turquoise, tourmaline, zircon
500 gp 
Alexandrite, aquamarine, violet garnet, 
 
black pearl, topaz
1,000 gp 
Black opal, emerald, fire opal, sapphire
5,000 gp 
Diamond, jacinth, ruby, star sapphire
Appropriate Gemstone Values by Tier: You can 
combine multiple gemstones into larger gemstones 
when creating the hoard, but avoid putting too much 
value in a single item, keeping in mind the appropri-
ate values based on the adventuring tier. A heroic 
tier gemstone should not exceed 1,000 gp, paragon 
hoards should have no gemstones less than 500 gp, 
and epic hoards should not have stones worth less 
than 1,000 gp.
Gemstone Variations: Keeping gemstone values 
at round numbers makes building hoards far easier 
and reduces the amount of record-keeping for vari-
ous stones. Still, gemstones are natural products. 
Some are larger or smaller in size, while others are 
cloudy, flawed, cracked or chipped, without the luster 
of finer specimens, or conversely, extremely radiant, 
fiery, brilliant, clear, or flawless. To adjust the value 
of a stone, multiply its base value by 5 or by 1/5, 
depending on whether you want to increase its value 
or reduce it. So, an exquisite ruby might fetch 25,000 
gp, while a flawed and cloudy ruby can bring in as 
little as 1,000 gp.
Example: In the previous example, the hoard starts 
with 18,900 gp in gemstones. Derek divides the gem-
stones into the largest denominations possible:
✦ Three 5,000 gp gems
✦ Three 1,000 gp gems
✦ One 500 gp gem
✦ 400 gp left over
He wants to have a few more gems to give the hoard 
more diversity, so he tweaks the denominations:
✦ Two 5,000 gp gems
✦ Seven 1,000 gp gems
✦ Three 500 gp gems
✦ 400 gp left over
Then Derek selects what kinds of gems are in the 
hoard. This dragon likes purple gems (it feels that 
its imperial demeanor harmonizes with that color), 
and there’s an opal mine in the kingdom the dragon 
lairs in.
✦ Two purple star sapphires (two 5,000 gp gems)
✦ Six fire opals (six 1,000 gp gems)
✦ One cloudy lilac diamond (one 1,000 gp gem, a 
diamond reduced in value to one-fifth its normal 
value because of its lack of clarity and fire)
✦ Three violet garnets (three 500 gp gems)
✦ 400 gp left over (which he throws back into the 
coins as gold pieces)
Art Objects
Of all the treasures one might recover from a dragon’s 
hoard, art objects are the most challenging. The 
reason is simple: Some effort is required to come up 
with interesting items that the PCs aren’t necessarily 
going to liquidate at their first opportunity. Saying the 
hoard contains three works of art worth 250 gp each 
is easy, but it’s also uninteresting. Offering simple, 
yet evocative, descriptions of art objects allows you to 
individualize the items in a dragon’s hoard and also 
offers the details needed to make the find greater 
than just another bag of treasure.
Pricing Art Objects: The easiest way to price 
an art object is to assign it a value appropriate to the 
characters’ tier. Reserve the lower-priced art objects 
for when the PCs are on the bottom half of a tier and 
the higher-priced ones for when the adventurers are 
on the top half. So, an art object for a group of 4th-
level characters should be worth 250 gp, regardless of 
what it is. Likewise, an art object for a party of 26th-
level characters should be worth 50,000 gp. This rule 
is elastic, and you can mix up the values as desired.

Defining Art Objects: When designing a new 
art object, you can use the following table and its 
attendant lists to generate art objects quickly. Start 
by picking a type of art object or rolling d20 to select 
randomly from those listed on the Art Objects table. 
Some types of art objects include lists to pick from 
to further define an object. Select from them if you 
want, or don’t, depending on the level of detail you 
need. Art objects with an (H) or (S) notation refer you 
to the item material lists—either the Hard Materials 
list or the Soft Materials list. Finally, if the art object 
includes any depictions or embellishments, you can 
select them from the Object Depictions or Object 
Embellishment lists.

C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
 Materials: A quick examination of the sample art 
objects in the Dungeon Master’s Guide reveals that 
art objects priced for heroic tier PCs are made of 
gold or are embellished with inexpensive gemstones. 
Paragon tier characters find platinum items or gold 
items with precious gemstones, while epic tier PCs 
find a variety of unusual and strange items, many of 
which hail from other planes. For epic art objects, 
use items made from fantastic materials. Substances 
such as celestial gold, astral weave, and solidified 
elemental fire give you a way to attach fantastical 
qualities to what is essentially an item with a high 
price tag.
Example: Derek’s hoard has 12,600 gp of art 
objects. He divides the art objects into the largest 
denominations appropriate to level 16–20 treasures 
(one worth 7,500 gp and three others worth 2,500 gp 
each):
✦ One 7,500 gp art object
✦ Three 2,500 gp art objects
✦ 100 gp left over
Then Derek defines what kind of art objects are in 
the hoard. The dragon’s lair is rather dank and has 
puddles of water here and there. He decides that 
clothing and furniture wouldn’t survive as treasure 
in it. He selects items made of hard substances—
jewelry, musical instruments, and utensils—as the 
art objects.
✦ One 7,500 gp piece of jewelry
✦ One 2,500 gp piece of jewelry
✦ One 2,500 gp musical instrument
✦ One 2,500 gp utensil
✦ 100 gp left over
Derek then fleshes out the descriptions of those items 
with details consistent with the paragon level (plati-
num, or gold set with gems) and the region of the 
dragon’s lair (more opals).
✦ One 7,500 gp circlet of elaborately twisted plati-
num wire
✦ One 2,500 gp gold necklace inlaid with fire opal 
veneer that frames a central black opal
✦ One 2,500 gp gold harp formed in the shape of a 
swan
✦ One 2,500 gp platinum ewer engraved with danc-
ing dragons
✦ 100 gp left over (which he throws back into the 
coins as gold pieces)
Luxury and Adventuring Items
Dragon hoards include a variety of luxury and adven-
turing items. Some items belonged to long-dead 
adventurers who thought to stake their claim on 
the hoard, while others might be incidental items, 
common gear the dragon snatched up along with 
the riches it was after. You can use this category to 
sprinkle in gear that the characters might need to 
replace, either in the form of adventuring equipment 
or luxury nonmagical items.
 
Pick one or more kinds of luxury and adventuring 
items that you prefer, or roll d20 to choose randomly 
from the kinds given on the following table. In many 
cases, especially with higher-level hoards, it won’t be 
feasible to fill out this category with a single kind of 
item, so don’t hesitate to use whatever combination 
of kinds you like. If you want this part of the process 
to be entirely random, roll 1d6 and use that result to 
dictate how many times you roll d20.
LUXURY AND ADVENTURING ITEMS

Adventuring equipment

 Luxury nonmagical item (weapon, armor, or 
shield)

17–20 Ritual scroll
 
Adventuring Equipment: This type of item 
encompasses common nonmagical gear found in the 
Player’s Handbook or other sources, including armor 
and weapons. These items are typically interesting 
only in low-level hoards. (If you’re filling out a para-
gon or epic hoard and you get this result on a roll of 
d20, roll again.)
 
Luxury Nonmagical Items: You can add inter-
esting elements to what would otherwise be ordinary 
adventuring gear. A luxury item is worth about two to 
five times as much as a normal item of the same sort 
(as described in the Player’s Handbook). It has a high 
price because of its quality, the materials from which 
it’s made, or who owned it previously.
 
A luxury item never confers a mechanical benefit 
and functions as a normal item of its kind. The story 
behind an item makes it more valuable. For example, 
a luxury nonmagical longsword could be the work of 
a famous dragonborn artisan. A fine backpack could 
have been owned by a famous adventurer thought 
long lost. 
 
Such an item could serve as the springboard to a 
minor quest. After finding the longsword, the PCs can 
set out to locate the artisan’s forge, or the backpack 
CONTAINERS
A great way to add flavor to a dragon’s hoard is to put 
the coins and other neat bits in interesting boxes. A silver 
coffer full of gold, or a goblet loaded with jewels inject a 
bit of diversity into the hoard. Just don’t forget to deduct 
the value of the container from the hoard’s monetary 
treasure value. It’s easiest to deduct it from the coins.

DRAGON HOARDS
can lead the adventurers to discover the 
final resting place of that fabled hero.
Residuum: Residuum, the universal 
component used to power rituals, is 
another useful way to fill out a dragon’s 
hoard. (Although a dragon likely wouldn’t 
create residuum on its own, the substance 
could easily have been in the possession 
of someone the dragon vanquished.) 
Residuum is usually contained in ornate 
boxes, intricate vials, and other valuable 
containers. The value of such vessels 
should be accounted for in the hoard. 
Residuum is worthwhile for characters 
who have the Ritual Caster feat, or 
anyone who possesses a ritual scroll, and 
it commands full market value if the PCs 
opt to sell the substance.
Ritual Scrolls: Dragons often keep 
ritual scrolls in their hoards, whether 
they can use the scrolls or not. Recogniz-
ing its power, a dragon is sure to keep 
such a scroll among his or her other 
valuable possessions, either on shelves or 
racks along with other documents or pro-
tected by a special scroll tube.
 
It’s up to you to determine whether 
the total value of ritual scrolls in a hoard 
is represented by one scroll or a number 
of them. You can divide the amount 
represented by scrolls into a number of 
lower-level scrolls as long as the com-
bined value is close to the target figure. 
As with any treasures, make up the price 
differences by adjusting the number of 
coins to make sure the hoard’s overall 
value remains appropriate for the party’s 
level.
Example: Derek’s hoard has 3,150 gp 
worth of luxury and adventuring goods. 
This is a paragon tier hoard, so Derek 
immediately decides that he doesn’t want 
to include any normal adventuring gear. 
He also elects not to include any luxury 
nonmagical items, primarily so that he 
can load up this portion of the hoard with 
scrolls that the PCs can use during their 
upcoming challenges in the next adven-
ture. To round out this part of the hoard, 
he throws in enough residuum to pay the 
component cost of the Consult Mystic 
Sages ritual. He makes sure the scrolls 
have cases that are resistant to dampness, 
and accounts for the value of the residuum 
container.
✦ One Consult Mystic Sages scroll 
(1,000 gp)
✦ One Raise Dead scroll (680 gp)
✦ One Remove Affliction scroll (680 gp)
✦  One Disenchant Magic Item scroll 
(360 gp)
✦  Each scroll is enclosed in a sturdy, 
wax-topped, lacquered bone scroll 
case (value 5 gp each)
✦  A small gold box (value 10 gp) holding 
residuum worth 400 gp
Oddities
The oddities in a dragon’s hoard consist 
of anything that doesn’t qualify for the 
other categories. If you can attach a value 
to it (even an arbitrary one), you can put 
it in a hoard.
 Space doesn’t permit a detailed discus-
sion of the possibilities, but two types of 
oddities—valuable papers and prisoners—
merit some elaboration.
Valuable Papers: These items include 
promissory notes and deeds. Promis-
sory notes are an easy way to transport 
large quantities of wealth, provided the 
characters can find people to honor the 
promise described in the document. 
In most cases, these documents are 
notes that guarantee the payment of an 
agreed-upon amount. Some require the 
possessor to seek out the person who 
wrote the note, while others can require 
finding the creditor or bank that holds 
the currency. A dragon is not likely to 
go searching for such payment, nor is a 
dragon going to find a promise on paper 
worth much of anything, so such finds 
are incidental treasures, perhaps found 
in the bottom of a chest or rolled up in an 
innocuous scroll tube.
 A dragon’s hoard can include other 
forms of documents, including the deed 
to a holding of land, the title to a ship, 
and treasure maps. Many hoards con-
tain plenty of junk, items that initially 
captured the dragon’s interest but are 
generally worthless. However, finding 
the deed to a castle in a distant land 
grants the PCs a tangible reward and a 
potential base of operations, while also 
leading them to another adventure site.
 What a document represents, as in 
the quality of the land, condition of 
the ship or structures, depends on the 
item’s relative value. Assign a price to 
land based on what you feel the land is 
worth. An area of a dozen acres could be 

70
C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
DEVON CADDY-LEE
worth a few hundred gold pieces or a few thousand, 
depending on local monsters, ruins, and the general 
importance of the site.
 
For obvious reasons, a treasure map can also be a 
springboard to further adventure. When you deter-
mine the value of a map that’s part of a dragon hoard, 
you also decide whether the map is authentic. If it is, 
then it points the way to a cache of the given value. If 
it’s not, then the value of the map represents the best 
possible price the PCs could get for it if they tried 
to sell it. If the characters make a copy of the map 
before selling it, then the map leads to another adven-
ture of your own design rather than a treasure cache. 
Otherwise, if the PCs opt to follow the map, it should 
lead to a relatively safe location (easy encounters only) 
that contains treasure equal to the map’s worth.
 
Pick one or more kinds of valuable papers that 
you prefer, or roll d20 to choose randomly from the 
kinds given on the following table. If you want this 
part of the process to be entirely random, roll 1d6 
and use that result to dictate how many times you 
roll d20.

Prisoners: Fearful peasants, cruel priests, and 
desperate lords might all offer up a sacrifice to 
appease an angry and threatening dragon. A dragon 
might also scoop up a prisoner or two while ransack-
ing a town or castle for its treasure, and in doing so 
gain a hostage to ensure that no one comes after it 
looking for revenge. Prisoners can be in any condition 
you need them to be, but dragons that don’t eat their 
prisoners right away are conscientious enough to 
keep them fed (perhaps to make a good meal of them 
later).
 
Rescuing a prisoner brings its own challenges. Not 
only do the player characters have to worry about 
themselves, but also they must protect the innocents 
the dragon keeps in its lair. Some prisoners might 
even come to love their captors and interfere with the 
PCs as they struggle to defeat the dragon. Provided 
the characters can keep the prisoner out of harm’s 
way, a prisoner as treasure provides interesting role-
playing opportunities and gives you a ready-made 
quest to deliver the prisoner to back to his or her 
proper place. Cashing in on a rescued prisoner 
should not be too hard—the characters did just defeat 
a dragon, after all. But it might involve skill chal-
lenges to negotiate for a suitable reward (which could 
result in additional treasure), keep their prisoner 
from running back to the dragon’s lair, and ultimately 
ensure that their rescued victim stays alive.
 
For a prisoner to be worth the trouble to take 
home, the reward has to be considerable. Otherwise, 
a party might just turn the hapless victim loose and 
expect the wretch to find his own way through the 
dark. In all likelihood, this poor rescue just gets 
gobbled up by another terror of the night. Therefore, 
when adding a prisoner to a dragon hoard, consider 
carefully the makeup of the party and the likelihood 
of their escorting a rescued prisoner back to his or 
her proper place. If the PCs are in the least bit cal-
lous, it’s probably best to account for this part of the 
hoard in a different way.
 
Other Oddities: Any other anomalous thing that 
reveals a historical quirk or psychological aspect 
of the dragon can be incorporated as an oddity in 
a dragon’s hoard. Animals preserved in odd cases 
or placed frozen in time through magical rituals, 
games of skill or chance, divinatory items, artist’s 
and artisan’s tools—let your imagination run wild, 
assign a value, and describe the item. Oddities are 
the spice of a hoard, though, not the meat. A little 
goes a long way.
 
Example: Derek’s hoard has 3,150 gp worth of odd-
ities. He thinks the treasure already contains enough 
“spendable stuff,” so he decides to put a prisoner into 
the hoard. The unlucky “oddity” is the son of the 
mayor of the nearest town, who went missing while 
on a hunting trip a couple of weeks ago. The reward 
for his safe return is, coincidentally enough, 3,150 gp.

DRAGON HOARDS
Trade Goods
Some dragon hoards contain a lot of bulky material—
the result of hitting ships and caravans that were 
carrying herbs, rare cloth, lumber, refined metal, 
spices, and other commodities. You can select trade 
goods of one or more general types from the Trade 
Goods table (or roll for them if you wish). The Sample 
Trade Goods by Type table gives possible materials 
for each of the general types.
 
Trade goods add realism to a hoard, but can also 
add complications if that realism is taken to an 
extreme. For instance, almost all the value of the 
cargo in an ordinary caravan is tied up in mundane 
items such as foodstuffs and textiles. If you apply that 
bit of realism to the trade goods in a dragon hoard, 
you could end up with a hoard that includes (among 
other sorts of trade goods) dozens of barrels of grain 
and crates of cheese—taking up a lot of room, but 
adding very little to the value of the hoard.
 
To avoid that sort of situation (if you want to), you 
can decide that the dragon was picky about what 
trade goods it commandeered. By sticking to the 
high-priced items, you can amass several thousand 
gold pieces’ worth of trade goods without taking up 
much space.
 
Alternatively, you can retain a nod to realism by 
saying the hoard does contain (among other trade 
goods) 1,000 gp worth of corn and 600 gp worth 
of cheese, and then leave it up to the characters to 
decide how much, if any, of that stuff they want to 
cart away,

there’s no guarantee that the market has a demand 
for these items, meaning the price the PCs get for the 
items could be as little as half of what they’re worth. 
On the other hand, if the PCs manage to find a place 
that has high demand for such goods, the adventurers 
might receive more than the normal price.
Metal Bars: Metal bars, also called trade bars, 
retain their value and function much like currency in 
that respect. Some merchants use trade bars for large 
transactions. Most trade bars bear a stamp of own-
ership, signifying where the bar was made and the 
identity of its original owner. 
 
Example: $Derek’s hoard contains 3,150 gp worth 
of trade goods. He likes the idea of tossing in a few 
crates and barrels and casks of cheap material, 
because the containers can act as terrain features. 
He decides that a barrel is large enough to occupy 1 
square and provide cover, and a square containing a 
crate or a cask is difficult terrain.
 
When he designs the lair in which the dragon’s 
hoard is contained, he puts these terrain features in 
particular squares: 5 crates of cheese (total value 200 
gp), 6 barrels of flour (total value 120 gp), and 15 
casks of fine ale (total value 30 gp). Waiting to be dis-
covered among the clutter of the hoard are a 1-gallon 
container of exotic dye (800 gp) and half a bolt of 
cloth of gold (2,000 gp).
 
Derek’s finished 18th-level dragon hoard looks 
like this:
✦ +5 vicious longsword
✦ 110 pp, 10,447 gp, 11,030 sp
✦ Two purple star sapphires, six fire opals, one 
cloudy lilac diamond, and three violet garnets
✦ A 7,500 gp circlet of elaborately twisted plati-
num wire, a 2,500 gp gold necklace inlaid with 
fire opal veneer that frames a large central black 
opal, a 2,500 gp gold harp formed in the shape of 
a swan, and a 2,500 gp platinum ewer engraved 
with dancing dragons
✦ Four ritual scrolls in sturdy, wax-topped, lacquered 
bone scroll cases: Consult Mystic Sages (1,000 
gp), Raise Dead (680 gp), Remove Affliction (680 
gp), and Disenchant Magic Item (360 gp) and four 
small gold cubical boxes (worth 5 gp each) each 
holding residuum worth 100 gp
✦ The mayor’s son, who brings a 3,150 gp reward for 
his safe return
✦ Trade goods with a total value of 3,150 gp, includ-
ing half a bolt of cloth of gold, 1 gallon of exotic 
dye, 5 crates of cheese, 6 barrels of flour, and 15 
casks of fine ale.
Sample Hoards
Sometimes you don’t have the time to build a hoard of 
your own. This section includes thirty sample dragon 
treasure hoards, one for each character level. Treat 
the hoards as starting points and customize them as 
you see fit. Tailor them to your party’s composition, 
needs, or desires.
 
Each hoard includes three or four parcels worth 
of treasure: one or two magic items parcels and 
the value of two parcels of monetary treasure (par-
cels 6 and 10 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, pages 
126—129). The parcels used are listed for each hoard.
LEVEL 1 (MONETARY TREASURE 220 GP)
Parcels 4, 6, and 10
✦ A small chest holds 90 gp, 90 sp, and 100 cp.

DRACONIC ARTIFACTS
Potent magic is linked to dragons—to their history, 
to their wars, to their faith, and simply to their exis-
tence. Dozens if not hundreds of such unique magical 
artifacts have appeared throughout the ages. Pre-
sented here is a mere fraction of them.

Ilthuviel’s Blackened Heart is appropriate for characters

Ilthuviel’s Blackened Heart 
Paragon Level
The great green wyrm Ilthuviel was one of the first dragons 
that sought to become a dracolich. Something went awry, and 
he did not gain lichdom. This matte platinum amulet has a 
green dragon’s black and shrunken heart embedded within it.
Ilthuviel’s Blackened Heart is an amulet of health +4. It has the 
following properties and powers.
Item Slot: Neck
Enhancement: Fortitude, Reflex, and Will
Property: Gain resist 10 poison.
Property: You can speak and understand the Draconic 
language and can read the Iokharic script.

Roleplaying Ilthuviel’s 
Blackened Heart
The great green wyrm Ilthuviel was among the first 
dragons to seek immortality through the process of 
becoming a dracolich. Legends disagree as to whether 
the procedure failed, or if someone interfered with 
the ritual at the last minute. Whatever the case, the 
rite went awry. Ilthuviel was utterly consumed in 
an inferno of black hellfire. He spat his rage and his 
hatred into a final curse as he died, and when the 
flames faded away, what remained was the dragon’s 
black and shrunken heart, a vessel for all the evil he 
wished upon the world and upon the deities who had 
allowed his life to end.
 
The Heart only rarely communicates verbally. It 
sends waves of longing through its owner when it 
wishes the owner to take an action, or waves of loath-
ing and even physical pain when it’s displeased.
 
It urges its owner to grab what power and author-
ity it can and to interact with others from a position of 
strength.

VINCENT DUTRAIT
DRACONIC ARTIFACTS
Pleased (16–20)
“The Heart is proud of me, and together we can gain power 
over this world that even a true dragon would envy.”
 
The Heart approves of the owner’s desire to wield 
power over others, and it sees further potential 
within the owner.
The Heart’s enhancement bonus increases to +6.
Property: The Heart grants you a +4 bonus to Intimidate 
checks.
Power (Daily ✦ Poison): Standard Action. You can attack 
with the breath weapon of an elder green dragon: Close 
blast 5; Constitution vs. Fortitude; 2d10 + Constitution 
modifier poison damage, and the target takes ongoing 15 
poison damage and is slowed (save ends both). Aftereffect: 
The target is slowed (save ends).
 
    This power replaces the poison spittle granted by the 
Heart when it is satisfied.
Power (Daily ✦ Conjuration): Standard Action. You conjure 
a weaker manifestation of Ilthuviel’s original form. This 
conjuration takes the form of an elder green dragon. The 
dragon follows your commands willingly, but it can take 
only a single action each round. The dragon is otherwise 
a normal elder green dragon in form and abilities, and it 
can be killed as normal. Sustain Standard: You can sustain 
the conjuration for up to 1 minute, or until the elder 
green dragon conjuration is slain.
Satisfied (12–15)
“The Heart respects me, and it can sense my potential. It 
gives me confidence to become a stronger leader.”
 
The wielder has proven to the Heart that he or she 
isn’t just another weak-willed humanoid. The Heart is 
willing to grudgingly grant the owner power as long 
as the owner continues to prove worthy.
The Heart’s enhancement bonus increases to +5.
Property: The Heart grants you a +2 bonus to Intimidate 
checks.
Power (Daily ✦ Poison): Standard Action. You spit a gout 
of poison: Ranged 5; Constitution vs. Fortitude; 2d10 + 
Constitution modifier poison damage.
Normal (5–11)
“The Heart is indifferent to me. I’ll need to gain its trust 
and prove my strength of will.”
 
When the owner first touches Ilthuviel’s Blackened 
Heart, he or she is probably at this concordance. The 
Heart dislikes the owner, but hasn’t grown to despise 
him or her.
Unsatisfied (1–4)
“The Heart is disappointed with my weakness and frailty. 
Without the confidence it lends me, I worry over every cru-
cial decision.”
 
The Heart has all but given up on the wielder, 
deciding that the wielder is just like every other 
humanoid, weak and pathetic.
The Heart’s enhancement bonus drops to +2.
Special: You take a –2 penalty to Intimidate checks, to your 
Will defense against fear effects, and to saving throws to 
end fear effects. This applies regardless if you are using or 
simply wearing the Heart.
Special: The Heart causes you to hesitate in battle. Each 
time you roll initiative, you must roll twice and take the 
lower roll.
Angered (0 or Lower)
“Waves of painful anger clutch my heart. The Heart 
despises me. I am assailed by doubts and see failure in 
every possibility unless the Heart tells me what to do.”
 
The Heart believes that the wielder is utterly 
worthless, and it will do all it can to destroy its owner.
The Heart’s enhancement bonus drops to 0.
Special: You take a –5 penalty to Intimidate checks, to your 
Will defense against fear effects, and to saving throws to 
end fear effects. You take a –5 penalty to attack rolls and 
all defenses against dragons. This applies regardless if 
you are using or simply wearing the Heart.
Special: The Heart causes you to hesitate in battle. Each 
time you roll initiative, you must roll twice and take the 
lower roll.
Special: Any time you are reduced to fewer than 0 hit 
points and then healed, the Heart takes over. You are 
dominated (save ends), and the Heart causes you to 
attack your allies.
Moving On
“The Heart swells with pride over my achievements but 
yearns to impart the strength of its will to a true dragon. I 
need to find it a worthy dragon for it.”
 
The Heart recognizes that it has attained all the 
power this feeble humanoid can offer, and it seeks 
a green dragon master. Unlike many artifacts, the 
Heart tells the owner that it will soon be leaving. The 
Heart requests that its wielder find a worthy dragon to 
become its new master. It does not tell its owner what 
rewards it offers for doing so or what punishment it 
threatens for failure.

78
C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
 
If the owner deliberately seeks out an elder or 
ancient green dragon and offers it the Heart, the arti-
fact grants its wielder a final boon. The owner gains 
a permanent +2 bonus to Intimidate checks, to Will 
defense against fear effects, and to saving throws to 
end fear effects.
 
If the owner gains a level without having begun 
a quest to find an appropriate dragon—or gains a 
second level without having completed such a quest—
the Heart crumbles to ash (re-forming elsewhere 
in the world) and strikes its owner with a curse of 
nightmares. The owner takes a –2 penalty to Will 
defense against fear effects and a –2 penalty to saving 
throws to end fear effects. Two uses of the Remove 
Affliction ritual (one for each effect) can end these 
penalties.
 
Until it moves on, the Heart retains all the 
powers and properties appropriate for its current 
concordance.
Blue Orb of Dragonkind
The Blue Orb of Dragonkind is appropriate for epic-
level characters.
 
The Orb presented here is the Blue Orb, the one 
that has reappeared most often in recorded history. 
Were Orbs created for every other color of chromatic 
dragon? If they were, have they all survived to the 
present day? Answer these questions as best suits 
your campaign. When designing other Orbs, you 
can use the Blue Orb as a model, changing details as 
appropriate. For instance, the Green Orb might look 
similar but of a green hue, dominate green drag-
ons rather than blues, enhance and protect against 
poison, and improve charm powers rather than 
powers that have a push effect. Alternatively, you 
might build entirely new suites of powers, using this 
Orb purely as a baseline.
Blue Orb of Dragonkind 
Blue Orb of Dragonkind 
Epic Level
The reasons for the primeval struggle between dragons and 
humanoids are long lost, but the artifacts created during that 
time are not. Among the greatest are the Orbs of Dragonkind, 
which grant powers similar to—and over—particular kinds 
of wyrms. This pale blue crystal sphere is small enough to 
be held in the palm of a human. Faint wisps of gold swirl 
throughout it.
The Blue Orb of Dragonkind is a +4 orb of invasive fortune. It 
has the following properties and powers.
Implement (Orb)
Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls
Critical: +4d8 damage
Property: Against blue dragons, the Orb’s critical hit damage 
increases to 4d10.
Power (Daily): Immediate Interrupt. You can use this power 
when an enemy within 10 squares of you successfully 
recharges a power. The recharge fails, and you regain the 
use of an expended encounter power.
Property: The Orb grants you an additional +1 bonus to 
attack rolls for powers that cause push effects and for 
powers that deal lightning damage.
 
 Powers that deal lightning damage to a blue dragon 
ignore the dragon’s lightning resistance when they are 
used through the Orb.
Property: You can speak and understand the Draconic 
language and can read the Iokharic script.
Goals of the 
Blue Orb of Dragonkind
Each Orb has the personality of a variety of dragon, 
imbued within it at the time of the artifact’s creation. 
Thus, each color of Orb has different goals. The Blue 
Orb has the following goals:
✦ Defeat its enemies—those of the bearer, those of 
blue dragons in general, and those of whoever 
created the Orb (the specifics of which are left up 
to the DM)—while placing the bearer in as little

✦ Ensure the artifact’s, and the bearer’s, survival.
Other Orbs might seek power through more violent 
means, or might even seek to protect humanoids from 
the depredations of other dragons.
Roleplaying the 
Blue Orb of Dragonkind
The Blue Orb is incredibly arrogant (as would be 
expected of an ancient dragon). It sees itself as a 
civilized and intelligent mentor of an unfortunately 
foolish and childlike bearer. It patronizes its bearer, 
pointing out the obvious and explaining everything 
in great detail. That said, when the bearer does 
something to truly impress it, it says so in complimen-
tary—if obviously startled—terms.

“Dragons look down upon the rest of you. They do not look

The owner has all but melded with the Orb. The 
owner’s desires and intents are those of the Orb, and 
the Orb’s are the owner’s.
The Orb’s enhancement bonus increases to +6.
Property: Against blue dragons, attack powers used through 
the Orb can score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20. Against

+6 for blue dragons and +4 for other dragons.
Power (Daily): You can ask the Orb a question, drawing 
upon the ancient knowledge of the imprinted dragon 
personality, as described in the Consult Mystic Sages 
ritual. Use of this power has no component cost. You 
can do this even if you aren’t trained in Religion or do 
not have the Ritual Caster feat. If the question involves 
dragons, you gain a +2 bonus to the check. If it involves 
blue dragons, the bonus is +4.
Power (Daily ✦ Charm, Implement): Standard Action. 
Targets blue dragons (but see below). Ranged 10; 
Intelligence vs. Will, Wisdom vs. Will, or Charisma vs. 
Will; the target is dominated until the end of your next 
turn. Miss: The target is dazed until the end of your next 
turn. If the attack misses, you can use the power again in 
a later encounter. (You cannot use it again in the same 
encounter.) This power can succeed on only one target 
per day. Sustain Standard: Repeat the attack. You can 
sustain the power for up to 5 minutes, or until you miss.
 
 
This power replaces the dazing power granted by the 
artifact when it is satisfied.

per day. Sustain Standard: Repeat the attack. You can 
sustain the power for up to 5 minutes, or until you miss.
Special: You can occasionally receive dream images of the 
dragon that dwells within the Orb. The dragon can reveal 
to you where to find great magic, or point you toward 
powerful enemies. (In other words, this dragon can be a 
source of quests.)

“I’ve come to believe I was a dragon in a prior life. That old

the Orb can score a critical hit on a roll of 19–20.
Property: You gain resist 15 lightning.
Power (Daily): By spending an hour to peer into the depths 
of the Orb, you can use the Orb to scry on a creature, 
as described in the Observe Creature ritual. Use of this 
power has no component cost, and the Orb is the focus. 
You can do this even if you aren’t trained in Arcana or 
do not have the Ritual Caster feat. If you’re scrying on 
a dragon, you gain a +2 bonus to your Arcana check. If 
you’re scrying on a blue dragon, you gain a +4 bonus to 
the check.

“It’s had a hundred bearers over thousands of years. So far, 
I’m failing to impress.”
 
The Orb hasn’t entirely decided that the owner is

Special: You take a –2 penalty to all Charisma-based skill 
checks involving dragons.
Displeased (0 or Lower)
“I have proven woefully unworthy of this ancient power.”
 
The Orb has declared the owner a failure. Its help 
is minimal; it nags, broods, and is a detriment to 
the owner’s efforts, even damaging the owner as a 
punishment.
The Orb’s enhancement bonus drops to +2, it no longer 
grants a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls with 
lightning powers, and it no longer overcomes a blue 
dragon’s lightning resistance.
Special: When you use any attack power that does not deal

Moving On
“I have become one with the blue dragons of the world.”
 
The Orb recognizes that it’s time to move on, and 
that its purposes in the world—and with the world’s 
dragons—are better served elsewhere.
 
When the owner next gains a level, the Orb disap-
pears, transporting itself to some other realm where 
dragons and dragonslayers struggle against one 
another. It appears to shatter into tiny fragments and 
powder. The resulting detritus is powdered astral dia-
mond, worth 250,000 gp.
 
Until it moves on, the Orb retains all the 
powers and properties appropriate for its current 
concordance.

The Spear of Urrok the Brave is appropriate for charac-

Spear of Urrok the Brave 
Spear of Urrok the Brave 
Heroic Level
Urrok the Brave was the greatest champion of the Empty Eye 
orc tribe. He fought in hand-to-hand combat with four separate 
dragons. When Urrok finally fell against the fifth dragon, the 
shamans of his tribe recovered his spear, adorning it with mystic 
runes and potent fetishes. The Spear of Urrok the Brave has 
spilled the blood of dozens of dragons by now, not only in the 
hands of orcs, but also in those of wielders of other races.
The Spear of Urrok the Brave is a +2 dragonslayer longspear. It 
has the following properties and powers.
Enhancement: Attack rolls and damage rolls
Critical: +2d8 damage, or +2d12 damage against dragons
Property: This weapon provides resist 5 against dragon 
breath attacks.
Power (Daily): Minor Action. Your next attack roll with 
this weapon against a dragon, if made before the end 
of your turn, gains a +5 power bonus, and the attack 
automatically ignores any resistance the dragon has.
Property: You have threatening reach when you use the 
Spear. You can make opportunity attacks from up to 2 
squares away.
Power (Daily ✦ Martial, Weapon): Standard Action. You 
can use talon of the roc (fighter 13).
Power (Daily): Free Action. Use this power when you hit an 
enemy with the Spear. The next time the enemy would 
successfully recharge a power, the success becomes a 
failure.
Goals of the Spear 
of Urrok the Brave
✦ Kill dragons.
✦ Expand the glory of the orc people and the Empty 
Eye tribe.
✦ Gain glory in combat.
Roleplaying the Spear 
of Urrok the Brave
The Spear of Urrok the Brave is impatient and forth-
right. It has no tolerance for long-term planning or 
negotiation. That said, it is not stupid, and it appreci-
ates the value of tactical combat.
 
It urges its bearer to engage any dragon in combat, 
and grows enraged if refused. It encourages the 
wielder to enter combat to solve any other conflict as 
well, but it is less infuriated if refused.

“The Spear speaks to me of the lineage of orc blood flowing

The wielder has proven to be a skilled combatant 
and a worthy possessor of the Spear. The spear cries 
out its bloodlust at the start of combat.
Property: The Spear’s battle cry spreads fear and hesitation. 
All your foes take a –2 penalty to initiative. This is a fear 
effect.
Property: You gain a +5 bonus to Will defense against fear 
attacks.
Property: If you spend an action point to take an extra

“Though I am no orc, the Spear honors me as a potent

The Spear would prefer an orc bearer, but has 
acknowledged the wielder’s skill and even come 
to appreciate it. Though the wielder hasn’t yet 
earned the weapon’s enthusiasm, he or she has its 
cooperation.
Property: You gain a +2 bonus to Will defense against fear

Power (Encounter): Minor Action. You gain a +4 bonus to 
your speed on your next charge attack, as long as you 
make it before the end of your next turn.

“The Spear sees me as weaker than it would like. It offers 
me the opportunity all warriors deserve: to prove myself in 
battle.”
 
When the wielder first acquires the Spear, it des-
perately wants the wielder to prove himself or herself 
to it. It demands that the wielder enter combat soon 
and encourages the wielder to seek out dragons and 
other deadly foes.
Unsatisfied (1–4)
“The Spear thinks I am pathetic and cowardly. It demands 
I prove myself now or be known forever as a weakling.”
 
The Spear has begun to despise the wielder, and 
offers the wielder only a limited amount of time to 
prove his or her unsatisfactory impression on the 
Spear to be false.
Special: You take a –2 penalty to attack rolls and damage 
rolls against any creatures other than dragons. This 
penalty applies whether you are using or merely carrying 
the Spear.
Displeased (0 or Lower)
“The Spear curses me and reviles my name. It says that my 
blood will quench the thirst of the weeds, and my name will 
be trampled into the earth and forgotten.”
 
The wielder is as nothing to the Spear of Urrok the 
Brave, and the Spear wants nothing to do with the 
wielder. The Spear claims that the wielder can regain 
a shred of honor only by offering it to someone else.
Special: You take a –5 penalty to attack rolls and damage 
rolls against creatures other than dragons. This penalty 
applies whether you are using or merely carrying the 
Spear.
Special: Any time you enter battle with orcs, the Spear 
screams for them to reclaim it. The orcs gain a +4 bonus 
to initiative, and a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage 
rolls against you. These bonuses apply whether you are 
using or merely carrying the Spear.
Moving On
“The Spear tells me that I am a spirit kin to the orcs, and 
a great warrior. My name, my valor, and my deeds will be 
remembered until the sun goes dark. The Spear will speak 
of my deeds to inspire ferocity in its next bearer.”
 
The Spear believes that it has gained all the glory 
it can with its owner, and that it must move on to 
face new challenges. Unlike many artifacts, the Spear
tells the owner that it will soon be leaving. The Spear
requests that the owner give it to a worthy orc. It does 
not reveal what reward it offers if the owner does so.
 
If the owner seeks out an orc warrior to voluntarily 
hand over the Spear, the artifact grants the owner a 
final boon. It adds an enchantment to a nonmagical 
weapon of the owner’s choice, transforming it into a 
+2 dragonslayer weapon.
 
If the owner gains a level without having begun a 
quest to find an orc warrior worthy of the Spear—or 
gains a second level before completing such a quest—
the Spear vanishes one night and appears elsewhere 
in the world, ready for a new bearer.
 
Until it moves on, the Spear retains all the

Unconquered Standard 
of Arkhosia
The Standard is appropriate for characters of 11th 
level or higher.
Unconquered Standard of Arkhosia 
Unconquered Standard of Arkhosia Paragon Level
In one of the last great battles between Arkhosia and Bael 
Turath, a single dragonborn regiment held a fortress against 
multiple legions of tieflings and their diabolic allies. When the 
battle was over, every demon had fallen, every tiefling—and 
every dragonborn but one. Wounded, he still lifted his 
commander’s tattered standard before he set out for home. His 
people kept the banner as a sign of the victory. It disappeared 
with the fall of Arkhosia, but has reappeared throughout the 
centuries, infused with powers that bolster the righteous in their 
battle against evil. The Standard is a banner flying atop a pole 
of oak. The flag boasts the symbol of a golden dragon on a deep 
blue field.
To use the Standard’s powers, the bearer must either hold 
the Standard aloft or plant it in the earth and remain 
within 3 squares of it. The range of its various powers 
and properties is a number of squares equal to the 
bearer’s Charisma modifier (minimum 1). It has the 
following properties and powers.
Property: You and allies within range gain a +2 bonus to AC 
and saving throws when bloodied.
Property: You and allies within range add their Constitution 
modifiers to their healing surge values. (Dragonborn 
instead add an additional +2 to their healing surge 
values.)
Property: You and allies within range gain a +1 bonus to 
death saving throws.
Property: You and allies within range gain resist 5 fire.
Power (Daily ✦ Martial, Weapon): Standard Action. You 
can use hail of steel (warlord 17).
Goals of the Unconquered 
Standard of Arkhosia
✦ Protect the innocent and aid those who would 
fight on their behalf.
✦ Destroy devils and tieflings wherever they lurk.
✦ Restore the glory of the dragonborn, honor the 
memory of Arkhosia, and take any opportunity to 
unite the race into a nation once more.
Roleplaying the Unconquered 
Standard of Arkhosia
The Standard is like an encouraging commanding 
officer. It offers tactical advice, reassures and coaxes 
its bearer on to greater efforts, and—on occasion—
berates him or her for failure or for stupid mistakes.
 
It urges its bearer to step forward and protect the 
innocent wherever they’re in danger. It grows partic-
ularly agitated when devils or tieflings are involved, 
and the only time it grows truly enraged at its bearer 
is if he or she allows the evil of such creatures to go 
unopposed.

“I am worthy of the memory of Arkhosia. The Standard 
tells me that the dragon empires of old would have wel-
comed me at their side.”
 
The bearer has gained the Standard’s respect. It 
stands with the bearer against all foes.
Property: You and all allies within range can use second 
wind one extra time during combat.
Property: The fire resistance granted by the Standard
increases to 15.
Power (Daily): Minor Action. You can grant one ally an extra 
action point. He or she must use that action point before 
the end of the current encounter, or it is lost.
Power (Daily): By planting the Standard’s shaft in the earth, 
you can command the Standard to watch over you. This 
benefit allows you to use the Eye of Alarm ritual without 
paying the component cost. You can do so even if you 
aren’t trained in Arcana or do not have the Ritual Caster 
feat. The Standard serves as a singular watchful eye, 
rather than creating one or more; the Arcana check still 
determines what kind of vision or sensory ability the 
watchful eye possesses for this use.
Special: You occasionally see visions and have dreams of the 
glory of Arkhosia before it fell. These might show you 
the location of other ancient treasures or strongholds of 
the fallen empire. (In other words, the Standard can be a 
source of quests.)
Satisfied (12–15)
“I have done well. With the Standard’s help, I will continue

greater powers.
Unsatisfied (1–4)
“While not everyone is cut out to be a hero, I must try 
harder not to shame the Standard.”
 
The Standard doesn’t feel that the bearer is cut out 
to use it, but it’s willing to give the bearer a bit longer 
to prove either way. That said, it’s going to do what it 
can to push the bearer into greater heroics.
Special: You and your allies still gain the Standard’s fire 
resistance and bonus to death saving throws. Beyond 
these, however, the Standard allows you to use its powers 
only against devils, tieflings, demons, evil dragons, and 
the cultists of evil deities or other evil personages.
Displeased (0 or Lower)
“The Standard is at odds with me. It longs for a more 
heroic bearer.”
 
The bearer is not a hero, as far as the Standard is 
concerned. It’s only a matter of time before it finds 
another bearer.
Special: You and your allies still gain the artifact’s fire 
resistance and bonus to death saving throws. None of its 
other powers function for you or your allies.
Moving On
“I can stand on my own now, even against the greatest 
evils. The Standard needs to leave now to help those who 
cannot.”
 
The Standard is determined never to rest, never to 
stop, while there remains evil to be fought, or there 
is any chance—however small—of gathering the drag-
onborn into a nation once more. When it feels it has 
done all it can with this bearer, it leaves.
 
When the bearer next gains a level, the Standard 
disappears, unraveling into the wind and blow-
ing away, only to re-form elsewhere. The Standard 
bestows permanent resist 5 fire on the bearer. In 
addition, it grants the bearer a warlord at-will power 
of his or her choice, which the bearer gains in addi-
tion to his or her other at-will powers.
 
Until it moves on, the Standard retains all the 
powers and properties appropriate for its current 
concordance.
DRACONIC RITUALS
Dragons have long been associated with ancient 
knowledge, mystic secrets, and powers both potent 
and obscure. Some myths even attribute the origins 
of arcane magic to them, claiming that great wyrm 
sorcerers taught the first humanoids how to cast 
spells in times so long past even the mightiest divina-
tions reveal little of them.
 
Today, chromatic dragons express magical ability 
through rituals. Those mystical rites presented in the 
Player’s Handbook appear in dragon hoards as scrolls 
or parts of ritual books, but many other rituals are 
more commonly used by dragons than they are by 
humanoids, and a few are unknown beyond the vari-
ous draconic races.
 
How common these new rituals are in your cam-
paign is up to you. They might be available only in 
dragon hoards or in the books of those who study 
dragons, or they might be as common as any of the 
rituals in the Player’s Handbook.

So, how are you going to determine if a particular dragon is 
a capable ritual caster or not? You should, as usual, decide 
based on the needs of your campaign, but the easiest way 
is to treat all dragons as though they have the Ritual Caster 
feat. Ritual casting comes as naturally to dragons as using 
their breath weapons. In addition to the skills noted for 
each dragon variety, assume that at each age category—
young, adult, elder, and ancient—a dragon gains training in 
one additional skill for the purpose of ritual casting only. 
For instance, a young dragon can perform rituals that have 
Arcana as their key skill, while an elder dragon can select 
Arcana, Heal, and Religion.

Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this

ritual. The doorways can each be up to 4 squares in 
width. As part of performing the ritual, you must adorn 
the door frame or perimeter of the portal with various 
sigils and runes.
 
Your Arcana check determines how long the portal 
remains open and how well hidden it is (if you choose to 
make it secret).

DRACONIC RITUALS
 
When performing the ritual, you can choose whether 
the portal is obvious or hidden. If obvious, anyone looking 
through the enchanted doorway can see a hazy image of 
the destination, as defined in Linked Portal (Player’s Hand-
book, page 307).
 
If you choose to hide it, however, casual examina-
tion shows only a mirror image of the room in which the 
doorway is set. The effect is that if the door is opened 
or the doorway is looked through, the area beyond the 
door looks like another room of the sort one is already in. 
Dragons and wizards use this technique to make travel 
through their lairs difficult for those who do not know to 
avoid the portals.
 
A Perception check, with a DC equal to your Arcana 
check result when performing the ritual, is required to 
detect the deception. Success indicates that the observer 
sees a hazy image of the destination instead, as described 
in the Linked Portal ritual.
 
If the real destination is an area of obvious danger—a 
gaping chasm, a room on fire, a pit of spikes—then the 
portal cannot be hidden. You could, however, hide a 
portal that leads to a room full of secret traps, or one in 
which a monster is lurking just out of sight.
Easy Passage
The corridor pulses and convulses like a living thing before 
settling down to normalcy once more.
Level: 6 
Component Cost: 150 gp
Category: Exploration 
Market Price: 360 gp
Time: 30 minutes 
Key Skill: Arcana or Nature
Duration: 24 hours (special)
You create a slight dimensional warp along the length of 
a corridor, allowing it to hold larger creatures or objects 
than it otherwise could. A creature of a size that would 
normally have to squeeze through the area can instead 
move and act freely. A creature one size category too 
large to enter the space at all can instead do so by 
squeezing.
 
Your Arcana or Nature check result determines the 
maximum dimensions of the area affected.
Arcana or Nature
Check Result 
Area Affected
9 or lower 
Up to 1 square wide and 2 squares long
10–19 
Up to 1 square wide and 4 squares long

Up to 2 squares wide and 4 squares long
30–39 
Up to 2 squares wide and 8 squares long
40 or higher 
 Up to 3 squares wide and 12 squares long
 
For example, a Huge creature with a space of 3 (9 
squares) could freely move through an area 2 squares 
wide and could squeeze into an area 1 square wide. A 
Gargantuan creature with a space of 4 (16 squares) could 
freely move through an area 3 squares wide, and could 
squeeze into an area 2 squares wide, but would still be 
unable to enter an area 1 square wide.
 
The ritual’s effects last for 24 hours.
 
Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this 
ritual indefinitely keeping a focus in the vicinity. This ritual 
focus is a small hand, sculpted of platinum, worth 100 gp. 
The Easy Passage lasts as long as the focus remains within 
the affected area. You can hide or protect the ritual’s 
focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within the 
area defined by your Arcana or Nature check result.
False Aura
The object before you takes on a gentle, mystical glow. The 
glow strengthens slowly and subtly, and then abruptly 
fades away.
Level: 16 
Component Cost: 1,800 gp
Category: Deception 
Market Price: 4,500 gp
Time: 10 minutes 
Key Skill: Arcana
Duration: 24 hours (special)
False Aura makes a nonmagical item seem to be a magic 
item, making it appear magical to an Arcana check to 
detect magic. Your Arcana check result determines the 
DC for someone else’s Arcana check to detect magic to 
see through your deception. If the detect magic check 
fails, the inspecting character believes the item to be 
magical. You choose the fake power source of the item 
when performing the ritual. However, anyone attempting 
to use the item immediately recognizes its magic as fake.
 
The ritual’s effects last for 24 hours.
 
Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this 
ritual indefinitely by leaving the item near a small, jew-
eled eye of gold and ruby wrapped in a silken blindfold. 
The blindfolded eye is a focus worth 100 gp. As long as 
the item remains within 20 squares of the focus, the False 
Aura remains in effect. You can hide or protect the ritual’s 
focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within 
range. A single focus can maintain up to five Aura Masks 
(page 83) or False Auras on five separate items, as long as 
they are all close enough to the focus.
Sentinel Eye
You conjure forth a phantasmal sentry—a slender pillar 6 
feet tall, topped with a strange, floating, unblinking eye. 
The eye watches over your camp, alerting you to the pres-
ence of intruders and offering you the ability to spy on 
them in turn.
Level: 14 
Component Cost: 800 gp
Category: Warding 
Market Price: 4,200 gp
Time: 30 minutes 
Key Skill: Arcana
Duration: 24 hours (special)
This ritual creates watchful eyes that you place in any 
square within 10 squares of where you perform the ritual.

The watchful eyes function like those of the Eye of Alarm 
ritual (Player’s Handbook, page 304), except as follows. 
When the eyes detect an intruder, they sound no audible 
alarm, but instead alert you through a telepathic link. This 
link functions regardless of distance, though you must 
remain on the same plane.
 
The watchful eye also creates a mild connection 
between you and the creature that triggered it. “The crea-
ture that triggered the Sentinel Eye ritual’s watchful eye” 
is sufficient identification for the Observe Creature ritual 
(Player’s Handbook, page 309), if you wish to spy on it at a 
later date using that ritual. You can use the View Location 
ritual to spy on the location where a triggered creature 
was when the eye was triggered, if you have that ritual, 
since you obviously know the area in which you per-
formed Sentinel Eye. (However, that use has limited utility 
given the 1 hour performance time of View Location.)
 
The ritual’s effects last for 24 hours.
Optional Focus: You can extend the duration of this 
ritual indefinitely by keeping a focus in the vicinity. This 
ritual focus is a small, jeweled eye made of gold and ruby, 
worth 2,000 gp. The Sentinel Eye lasts as long as the 
focus remains within 20 squares of any of the watchful 
eyes. You can hide or protect the ritual’s focus in any way 
you like, as long as it remains within range.
Ward the True Name
A rush of voices flows through your mind, as though you 
eavesdropped on the whole world at once. Almost immedi-
ately it fades to a background rustle, as easily ignored as 
the trickling of a gentle stream, yet ever ready to leap to the 
forefront of your mind.
Level: 26 
Component Cost: 22,500 gp
Category: Scrying 
Market Price: 125,000 gp
Time: 8 hours 
Key Skill: Arcana (no check)
Duration: Permanent until discharged
If anyone anywhere in the world performs a divination or 
scrying ritual that is intended to gather information about 
you—such as someone using Consult Mystic Sages or Con-
sult Oracle to ask questions about you, or using Observe 
Creature to spy on you—you instantly become aware of 
it. You do not learn the nature of the ritual caster’s ques-
tions or efforts. You learn only the specific ritual that was 
performed. You also gain the ability to identify the ritual 
caster well enough to scry upon him or her in turn.
 
The effect of this ritual ends when you have been 
alerted to a divination or scrying attempt.
DRAGON COMPONENTS
The innately mystical and elemental nature of drag-
ons grants them numerous abilities while they live. 
Sometimes, in specific circumstances, a dragon’s 
strength and activities in life can imbue its remains 
with residual power that can be tapped with a ritual.
 
Though dragon remains are not normally con-
sidered useful ritual components, explicit situations 
can arise in which a portion of a particular dragon’s 
remains prove useful. For instance, if the blood of 
a dragon responsible for killing an individual crea-
ture is consumed as part of the ritual to speak with 
that creature’s corpse, the ritual has a better chance 
of success. Likewise, the bone from a dragon that 
injured or cursed a creature can be used as part of a 
ritual to restore that creature to health and lift any 
curses that creature might suffer because of the drag-
on’s actions.
 
Dragon remains are not easy to acquire, of course, 
not only because dragons tend not to want to part 
with their organs, but because such remains are dif-
ficult to harvest and do not keep well. But sometimes, 
under specific circumstances, it is worthwhile to try.
RAGON COMPONENTS

DRAGON COMPONENTS
The characters might not automatically assume that they 
should take special care to dissect a dragon and preserve 
its organs. Thus, if PCs wish to take from a dragon’s 
remains a component useful for a ritual, they must succeed 
on a DC 15 Nature check. If the PCs want to preserve the 
component for more than two days before using it, they 
must also succeed on a DC 25 Arcana check.
 
PCs on a quest might discover that a local “dragon 
of legend” was slain years ago by another adventurer. 
Because the nature of their quest requires them to 
learn something of what the dragon knew, they might 
desire to find a portion of that dragon’s remains to see 
if anything is salvageable. In such a circumstance, they’ll 
often be out of luck. However, it could be that parts from 
the named dragon they seek might be available from an 
alchemist who keeps them floating in a jar for curiosity’s 
sake, and who might be willing to sell them for a relative 
pittance.

DRAGON COMPONENTS
Uses of Dragon 
Components
The most common use of dragon components is to 
enhance rituals. Assuming the dragon component in 
question has a tie to the ritual’s target, its use requires 
no special preparation of the organs and no advance 
planning. The ritual performer holds out (or touches, 
in the case of larger components such as bones and 
the heart) the part or parts while completing the 
ritual.
 
Depending on the type of component (blood, 
bones, brain, eye, or heart) and the age of the dragon 
from which it is harvested (wyrmling, young, adult or 
older), a component can grant its user a benefit when 
performing a ritual. The younger the dragon, the 
lower the level of the ritual that the component can 
affect, as borne out in the following sections.
 
A component is drained of all its power in a single 
ritual performance, crumbling to ash or shriveling 
to gray, leathery flesh. Using a dragon component as 
an enhancement to a ritual is a one-time proposition. 
Also, any single dragon can provide only one “dose” 
of a certain kind of component—separate amounts of 
the same dragon’s blood, for example, can’t be used to 
enhance two or more ritual performances.
 
Also, a ritual performer cannot stack separate 
“doses” of a specific dragon component in a single 
ritual. For instance, although a dragon’s eye grants 
a +5 bonus to Arcana checks when performing an 
exploration ritual, using two eyes doesn’t increase the 
bonus to +10.
Blood
Dragon’s blood is infused with energy. It seethes with 
power, and even after a dragon is slain it continues to 
hiss and bubble.
 
Use in Rituals: If you use a vial of a dragon’s blood 
as part of a ritual, you gain a +5 bonus to any skill 
checks related to that ritual. The blood of a wyrmling 
can provide this benefit for any ritual of level 5 or 
lower; the blood of a young dragon aids any ritual of 
level 15 or lower; and the blood of an adult or older 
dragon can enhance any ritual of level 25 or lower.
Bones
A dragon’s bones are the center of its toughness and 
supernatural health. If a dragon injures or curses a 
creature, a bone from the dragon can be used as a 
component in any ritual performed on that creature 
that deals with health, healing, disease, or otherwise 
removing afflictions.
 
Use in Rituals: You can use an appropriate drag-
on’s bone to augment any restoration ritual of level 10 
or lower that you attempt on a creature harmed by that 
dragon. When using a bone in this manner, you can 
reroll the ritual’s Heal check, but you must accept the 
result of the second roll. You must decide to use the 
dragon component before making your skill check.
Brain
The brain of a dragon can be useful in expanding 
your own ritual-enhanced knowledge if the dragon 
in question is caught up in the question you desire an 
answer for. Thus, you could use a dragon’s brain as a 
component for the Speak with Dead ritual to talk to 
the dragon’s spirit, or any with any ritual that seeks 
to gather knowledge relating to an issue the dragon 
knew of or participated in.
 
Use in Rituals: You can use an appropriate 
dragon’s brain as part of any divination ritual that 
touches on an event or situation that the dragon was 
part of or had special knowledge about. When you do 
so, you gain a +5 bonus to any skill checks related to 

88
C H A P T E R  2  |  D M ’s  G u i d e  t o  D ra g o n s
that ritual. The brain of a wyrmling can provide this 
benefit for a ritual of level 10 or lower; the brain of a 
young dragon aids a ritual of level 20 or lower; and 
the brain of an adult or older dragon can enhance a 
ritual of level 30 or lower.
Eye
Dragons are renowned for their sharp vision and 
incisive perception, tools that prove useful in rituals 
relating to a particular dragon’s lair, its territory, or a 
location the dragon has visited.
Use in Rituals: You can use an appropriate 
dragon’s eye as part of any exploration ritual that is 
performed to learn information about that dragon’s 
lair, its territory, or some other site the dragon is spe-
cifically familiar with. You gain a +5 bonus to skill 
checks made as part of the ritual. The eye of a wyrm-
ling can provide this benefit for a ritual of level 10 or 
lower; the eye of a young dragon aids a ritual of level 
20 or lower; and the eye of an adult or older dragon 
can enhance a ritual of level 30 or lower.
Heart
A dragon’s heart is the seat of its soul, the organic 
component to the dragon’s destiny. In rare cases, the 
heart of a specific dragon has a resonant power that 
can be tapped in service toward the completion of a 
quest.
 
For instance, prophecy has it that the heart of 
Urishtar of Nightwyrm Fortress (an elder shadow 
dragon) will grant travelers using the Linked Portal 
or Planar Portal ritual an advantage if they are 
attempting to connect to the Shadowfell’s ancient 
core, Death’s Reach.
Use in Rituals: By using an appropriate dragon’s 
heart as part of a ritual associated with that dragon’s 
destiny or as part of an epic quest, you might choose 
to treat the d20 result of all skill checks related to 
that ritual as 10. The heart of a young dragon can pro-
vide this benefit for a ritual of level 10 or lower; the 
heart of an adult dragon aids a ritual of level 20 or 
lower; and the heart of an elder or older dragon can 
be used in a ritual of level 30 or lower.
FAMOUS DRAGONS
Some sages collect names of stars, spirits, deities, or 
exarchs, in hopes that the possession of such lists 
might make them wise or even grant them mastery 
over the workings of the world. In the same way, 
masters of arcane arts might assemble lists of dragons 
past and present. Within these lists, such masters 
seek keys of power in hidden congruencies and subtle 
threads.
 
No compilation has so far bequeathed anyone with 
such power, but lists continue to grow. Here follows 
a list of famous dragons from various worlds of the 
D&D game—a list by no means comprehensive. It is a 
mere sampling of the reams of known dragon names.
DRAGONLANCE® Setting
The world of the DRAGONLANCE setting may contain 
more dragons than any other.
Albino
This smallish dragon had the body shape and acidic 
breath of a black dragon, but his scales were white 
like snow. Albino was mistreated both by his fellow 
hatchlings and his own mother, the Snake of Black-
ness, for his small size and oddly hued scales. Albino 
got his revenge one day by walling off an underwaater 
lair entrance while the Snake of Blackness was out-
side with bricks he etched with his acid. Fleeing 
from Malystryx (see below), the Snake of Blackness 
descended beneath the surface to the lair entrance, 
only to find it blocked. Too short on air to return to 
the surface, she drowned. Albino appears in the story 
“The Albino” in the collection Search for Power.
Ember
This fierce red dragon was the mount and protector 
of Verminaard of Nidus. Verminaard was in charge of 
Pax Tharkas’s mines, supplying ore for weapons and 
armor to the Dragonarmies. Ember is referenced in 
the War of the Lance sourcebook.
Khisanth
A massive, sinuous black dragon, Khisanth guarded a 
fabulous treasure called the Disks of Mishakal in the 
ruined city of Xak Tasroth. In her underground lair 
in the sunken, ruined city, Khisanth gathered many 
other treasures to her besides the Disks, including a 
spellbook of Fistandantilus. Khisanth appears in DL1: 
Dragons of Despair.
Malystryx
When the Age of Mortals began, Malystryx was the 
first of the great Dragons to come to Ansalon from 
across the sea. Unbelievably massive, this fantastic

BEHIND THE SCENES: 
ORGANS AS TREASURE
Dragon blood, bones, or other remains could have a 
defined market value or general effect on rituals, but such 
rules are best used with great care. Considering a dragon as 
a set of component dragon parts could turn every encoun-
ter finale into a bizarre monster-butchering exercise “just 
in case” the parts in question have some value.
 
Unless you decide otherwise, the remains of the vast 
majority of dragons have no particular ability to enhance 
the potency of rituals, and thus the noted components 
have no value.

monster measured more than four hundred feet 
from snout to tail, with her wingspan reaching 
almost five hundred feet. Her deep red scales were 
each as large as a shield and as hard as steel. Her 
rule was finally ended by the hero Mina who slew 
the mighty dragon overlord. Malystyx appears in 
the novel Age of Mortals.
D&D (Greyhawk) 
Dragons
The oldest D&D campaign setting boasts many 
famous dragons.
Aulicus
In forgotten barrows in a lonely swamp lurks a 
vampiric lizardfolk whose grasp on power is aided 
and abetted by the black dragon Aulicus. This black 
dragon appears in the adventure I2: Tomb of the Lizard 
King.
Brazzemal the Bright
Brazzemal has unusually light scales for a red dragon, 
and a particularly bright flaming breath. The dragon 
is given to long periods of sleepy torpor. But these 
habits do not make it too vulnerable, thanks to the 
location of its lair in a deep cavern under the volcanic 
ground in the Hellfurnaces. Above his chamber, fire 
giants lair. This red dragon appears in the adventure 
G3: Hall of the Fire Giant King.
Calcryx
Calcryx was the white dragon wyrmling mascot of a 
kobold tribe that lived in the ruins of a fallen fortress 
known as the Sunless Citadel. The white dragon was 
stolen by enemy goblins, and its fate afterward was 
never fully established. Calcryx appears in the adven-
ture Sunless Citadel.
Farcluun
Near the Tower of the crazed mage Zagig is the cav-
ernous lair of the ancient red dragon Farcluun, who 
knew full well of Zagig’s unstable state, and took what 
advantage it could. Farcluun appears in WGR1: Grey-
hawk Ruins.
Nightscale
This young black dragon lairs beneath the fallen 
dwarfhold of Khundrukar in  a sunken cavern called 
the Black Lake. The dwarves are long gone, but vari-
ous goblin and orc bands now inhabit the tunnels, 
but view visit Nightscale, because the black dragon is 
always hungry. Nightscale appears in the adventure 
Forge of Fury.
Forgotten Realms 
Dragons
The dragons of Faerûn are legion. All the dragons 
described below appeared in DRAGON® Magazine’s 
Wyrms of the North feature.
Daurgothoth, 
“The Creeping Doom”
This male black dragon has embraced undeath, and 
hunts the world as a dracolich. This great dragon lairs 
not too far from Waterdeep, and through bribes and 
threat of death, “employs” several agents to purchase 
or steal interesting items in the City of Splendors to 
continue building his hoard. 
Hoondarrh, 
“The Red Rage of Mintarn” 
This male ancient red dragon keeps several lairs. His 
main one on the isle of Skadaurak is a vast complex 
of subterranean rooms with easy access for a flying 
dragon. The dragon has a deal with the folk of Min-
tarn; in return for a yearly tribute, Hoondarrh won’t lay 
waste to Mintarn, and sometimes he even protects it. 
Mornauguth, 
“The Moor Dragon”
This female adult green dragon lairs in the Misty 
Forest in an area of steep-sided, breakneck wooded 
ravines. Rumor has it that Mornauguth is a human 
transformed, trapped in green dragon shape by a 
curse. Formerly a priestess of Shar, her reckless ambi-
tions caught up with her.
Olothontor, 
“The Minstrel Wyrm”
This elder blue dragon lairs not far from Waterdeep. 
Olothontor loves music above all else. He is rumored 
to grant extravagant gifts to minstrels whose songs 
please him. Intruders who stumble into his lair and 
then play or sing won’t be attacked, so long as they 
furnish good music and plenty of it.
Voaraghamanthar, 
“The Black Death”
This elder black dragon has learned something of 
sorcery. It lairs in the Mere of Dead Men, a salt water 
swamp. Rumored to have the ability to be in two 
places at one time, in truth Voaraghamanthar and its 
clutch sibling, Waervaerendor, fool the incredulous 
by posing as each other as need demands. No one 
suspects the flitting black ghost of claws and jaws 
that strikes out of nowhere, that lives in black swamp 
waters that hide the bodies of victims soon to be 
dined upon, is really a team of two.

Dragon Lairs
Dragon Lairs
The vampire lord might dwell in his dark 
and gothic castle, the hag in her ramshackle hut in 
the swamp, or the kobold tribe in their underground 
warren. But although each of these locations lends 
itself to tales of high adventure, none is so central to 
its master’s fundamental nature as the dragon’s lair.
 
The lair is nearly as vital a recurring theme in 
myth and fantasy as the dragon’s hoard or even drag-
ons themselves. Whether it is a simple cave atop the 
peak of a misty mountain or a monster-filled, death 
trap-strewn complex that the characters must con-
quer to rescue a kidnapped princess, a dragon’s lair is 
the epitome of adventure sites.
 
At its simplest, a dragon’s lair is someplace for the 
great beast to rest and—more important—store its 
hoard. (It’s difficult for even the most powerful crea-
ture to accumulate great wealth if he has nowhere 
to put it.) One could argue, in fact, that the hoard is 
what makes the dragon’s lair necessary—and such an 
enticing setting for adventure. Player characters have 
plenty of places to go in the hope of finding worthy 
challenges and treasures great enough to make the 
effort worthwhile, but a dragon’s lair is one of the few 
locations where they know they can find both.
 
In practice, however, a dragon’s lair is more than 
a simple storehouse. Even the dullest wyrm is a 
cunning beast, and all but the youngest have had 
decades, if not centuries, to make their homes just 
so. A true dragon’s lair, then, isn’t just a place at all. 
It’s an element of the challenge posed by the dragon, 
a first—and sometimes second, third, and fourth—
line of defense against intruders. It might only delay 
thieves until the dragon can deal with them; it might 
offer the dragon tactical advantages in battle; it might 
even be able to take the lives of foolish adventurers 
in its own right, without its master lifting a claw. But 
however it is built, wherever it stands, and what-
ever form it takes, braving a dragon’s lair should 
make for an adventure as memorable as fighting 
the dragon.

C H A P T E R  3  |  D ra g o n  L a i r s
Environment defines a dragon’s home. Every lair bal-
ances utility and security.
 
Traditional lairs deep in untamed wilds are barely 
accessible to other creatures. Chromatic dragons, 
especially, are known for choosing lairs that comple-
ment their breath weapons. They do so not out of mere 
instinct but to meet the requirements of defense and 
comfort. The dragon must first and foremost find its 
own lair a livable home.
 
Rather than construct their own lairs, chromatic 
dragons prefer to dwell within natural formations or 
seize structures that were built for another purpose. 
Thus, one might find a red dragon in a dwarven mine 
and a white in a northern keep.
Security or 
Ease of Access
One of a dragon’s greatest advantages over intrud-
ers is its ability to fly. A wise dragon places its lair 
somewhere that is difficult to access by land or equips 
it with hazards that are difficult to bypass without 
taking to the air. The time required for an intruder 
to climb a mountain, cross a swamp, or navigate a 
dungeon is time that the dragon can spend preparing 
defenses, setting ambushes, or organizing minions. 
Even something as simple as undergrowth or broken 
stone floors provides a tactical advantage for an air-
borne dragon.
 
That’s why most lairs are so isolated. The dis-
tance is a minimal impediment to the dragon, but 
it severely lowers the odds of others discovering the 
lair—let alone having the strength and fortitude to 
reach it.
 
The flip side of this particular coin, and the 
dragon’s greatest liability when it comes to security, is 
size. Any ingress large enough for the dragon is large 
enough to admit potential intruders, and tiny open-
ings that the dragon cannot use (and might overlook) 
are ideal for a thief or a dragonslayer.
 
Access is one of the most difficult aspects of lair 
construction. A wise dragon wants at least two means 
of entrance or escape, but each additional entrance 
requires effort devoted to watching and protect-
ing it, and besides, no dragon can be certain that 
it has found every tiny aperture. Thus, terrain and 
traps come into play. If the main passages and inner 
sanctum are well guarded, even those who manage 
to sneak in undetected won’t have free rein. In fact, 
some dragons deliberately leave one or two obvious 
entrances open so that they’ll know the direction 
from which intruders will come, and they plan traps 
and defensive strategies accordingly.
Vantage or Concealment
The Monster Manual states, “Though red dragons 
prefer to lair deep underground, they often have high 
perches aboveground where they survey their terri-
tory, watching for intruders.” Although the mighty 
reds are particularly well known for this behavior, all 
chromatic dragons consider such a vantage point to 
be worthwhile. These territorial and even paranoid 
creatures seek every ounce of forewarning they can 
acquire.
 
On the other hand, a vantage point also makes 
a dragon more easily spotted. Wise dragonslay-
ers search for such locations to set up ambushes or 
simply avoid the obvious sight lines.
 
Some dragons, such as reds, are so sure of their 
abilities that they consider the advantages of van-
tage points to be worth the risks. Others, such as 
purples or blacks, prefer to err on the side of stealth 
and rarely bother with vantage points. The majority 
of chromatic dragons seek a middle ground. Some 
establish vantage points that are less obvious but 
also less effective. Blue dragons, for instance, watch 
from cloud-choked mountaintops, occasionally drop-
ping out of the cover for a quick look around before 
vanishing into the haze once more. Similarly, brown 
dragons watch from high sand dunes while burrowed 
beneath the surface, observing their territory from a 
makeshift bunker.
 
Other dragons establish multiple vantage points 
so that a foe never knows from which direction it is 
being watched. Greens are particularly well known 
for this tactic, establishing numerous perches on 
forest hills and even atop the largest trees, where 
leaves and branches conceal their presence.
Urban Lairs
A few dragons are too gregarious or politically ambi-
tious to dwell far from civilization. They prefer to 
live in the hearts of humanoid communities, where 
power and authority are easy to come by.
 
Chromatic dragons that dwell in urban rather 
than wilderness environments do so openly, making 
(or forcing) a place for themselves in the community. 
Most of these dragons attempt to set themselves up as 
tyrants, but others coexist more peacefully as royal 
advisors, religious leaders, the heads of powerful 
organizations or guilds, or even community protec-
tors. Even if the residents would rather see the dragon 
leave, any overt attack on the creature would prove 
damaging to the community as well, thus forcing 
the citizens to aid in the dragon’s defense. For these 
reasons, when a chromatic dragon chooses to dwell

LAIR FEATURES
in a humanoid community, it prefers larger cities to 
smaller villages.
 
An urban dragon looks for different traits in a 
lair than does one that dwells in the wilderness. In 
an urban environment, a dragon cannot depend 
on secrecy for safety. The citizens might not know 
exactly where its lair is located, but it’s a safe bet 
that they have some idea—at least as to the location 
of the entrance, if not the lair itself. Further, unless 
the location is underground or part of a truly enor-
mous building, such as the wing of a great palace, 
any structure large enough to serve as a lair probably 
will stand out. A fortress at the city’s highest point, 
a stone-walled complex hidden in the sewers (but 
far cleaner, of course), or a cave in the midst of the 
community’s sacred grove are all valid options. If a 
dragon can’t have secrecy, it tries for impregnability.
 
A dragon dwelling among humanoids either con-
trols the government or has spies and allies within 
the community’s power structure. In either case, such 
dragons lair near their allies for ease of communica-
tion and so that help, if required, is nearby.
 
Evil chromatic dragons use the citizens around 
them as shields. By making a lair in a heavily 
populated part of town, the dragon ensures that 
adventurers must be careful with area powers. The 
dragon might even bargain its way out of an unten-
able situation by threatening the lives of the people 
around its lair.
Planar Lairs
Some dragons make their homes in the Elemental 
Chaos, but these realms are so dangerous, strange, 
and unpredictable that most nonplanar dragons avoid 
them. A few make their lairs on floating islands in the 
Astral Sea, but they are so rare that few conclusions 
can be drawn. Most planar lairs exist in the Feywild 
or the Shadowfell. Although these chromatics some-
times come into conflict with planar wyrms, such 
struggles are less common than attacks by metallic 
dragon rivals or adventurers in the natural world.
 
Dragon lairs in the Feywild resemble wilderness 
lairs from the natural world, but exaggerated. The 
cave entrance isn’t just on a mountain peak, but at the 
pinnacle of thousands of feet of a sheer, crumbling 
cliff of shale. The lair isn’t surrounded by a dozen 
miles of dense forest, but by hundreds of miles of 
overgrowth as thick as hedgerows. A few Feywild-
dwelling chromatic dragons serve or cooperate with 
various faerie courts, but the majority treat the fey 
the same way chromatics in the natural world treat 
humans—as prey.
 
All known chromatic dragon varieties can be 
found in the Feywild, though blues, blacks, greens, 
and grays are most common.
 
The aesthetic tastes of dragons that dwell in the 
Shadowfell seem as subtly twisted as the rest of that 
macabre world. Even more so than in the natural 
world, they take advantage of what they can find 
rather than building homes of their own. Such 
dragons favor gloomy lairs, letting them lapse into 
complete darkness. Even the most orderly tolerate 
oddly twisted passages, and lairs have chambers that 
the dragon rarely uses. Adventurers tell of lairs in the 
Shadowfell where other monsters or undead moved 
in and made their homes without the dragon even 
being aware of them.
 
Purple dragons are among those most commonly 
found in the Shadowfell, sometimes dwelling on the 
surface of that world rather than underground. Intel-
ligent undead dragons prefer the Shadowfell as well. 
Other chromatic varieties are encountered there only 
occasionally.
 
Lairs in the Elemental Chaos are frequently made 
up of pure elemental forms. Reds dwell in castles of 
semisolid flame; whites in caves of purest ice; browns 
in manors of sand that reshape themselves with the 
wind; and blues in the heart of endless storms, on 
solid clouds linked by bridges of corporeal lightning. 
The nature of these lairs makes it impossible for any 
but the most powerful of adventurers to draw near.
 
Dragons that have elemental resistance are the 
ones most commonly found in the Elemental Chaos. 
Those that have only nonelemental resistances, such 
as the green dragon’s resistance to poison, never 
make their lairs here for fear that the realm might 
kill them.
Nine Lairs
This chapter includes three sample lairs for each tier 
of play, from a party’s introductory experience with 
dragon hunting in the heroic tier to the experienced 
dragon hunters of paragon levels to the home to the 
greatest of the great dragons in their epic lairs, where 
the ghosts of dead would-be dragonslayers scream in 
frustrated silence within their borders.
OPTIONAL ENCOUNTERS
In addition to the two tactical encounters presented for 
each lair, optional encounters are suggested in some loca-
tions for Dungeon Masters who wish to expand the lair 
into a longer adventure. Use some, all, or none of these, 
as you prefer.

A lair for five 5th-level adventurers
On the highland hills overlooking the town of Yevn 
Raeach, the winds blow cold, sweeping down from the 
frigid mountains barely visible to the north. The snows 
rarely fall, but the gusts carry the bite of winter, and 
the silence is broken by the occasional pelting of sleet.
 
Here perches what was once Yevn Raeach’s great-
est defense. Abandoned for centuries, it has a new 
inhabitant now: Khekolak, a young white dragon 
looking to make his place in the world—even if that 
place already belongs to the people of Yevn Raeach.
History
For generations, Yevn Raeach was beset by orcs of 
the Frozen Skull tribe. The town’s greatest defense 
against the orcs was Castle Korvald, named for the 
knight-errant who provided the funds to build it.
 
Twenty years after the fortress was constructed, 
a raid larger than any before struck Yevn Raeach, 
forcing the entire town to retreat behind the walls of 
Korvald. And there, for many months, they battled 
the tide of orcs.
 
When all was done, the castle lay in ruins, the 
greatest warriors of Yevn Raeach slain—but not in 
vain. The Frozen Skull tribe, its back finally broken, 
vanished into the mountains and never returned. 
Unable to afford repairs to the castle, the townsfolk 
let the ruins stand, a testament to their victory. In 
all the decades since, the town has remained largely 
unthreatened.
 
No longer. Having only recently departed his 
mother’s lair, Khekolak has decided that the ruins of 
Castle Korvald make an excellent home—and that the 
livestock (and townsfolk) make excellent meals.
 
Over the generations, the people of Yevn Raeach 
have become farmers and lumberjacks, ill equipped 
to take on even a young dragon. Yevn Raeach needs 
heroes eager to prove themselves.
Environment
Castle Korvald sits in a range of hills atop one par-
ticularly steep-sided rise. The following traits hold 
true for the castle and its surroundings, except where 
indicated otherwise.
✦ Climbing the hillside requires only a DC 10 
Athletics check because it is rough and provides 
natural handholds.
✦ The ruins’ cracked walls are an easy climb, but 
the stones frequently shift and crumble. Climbing 
requires only a DC 10 Athletics check, but a char-
acter falls if she fails by 3 or more, rather than the 
standard 5.
Various portions of Castle Korvald stand at different 
heights. These are marked on the map, but in brief:
✦ The floors of the castle and towers, as well as the 
surrounding hilltop, are at a baseline of 0 feet.
✦ The ground around the hill is at –30 feet.
✦ The bridge (area 1) and the walkway between area 
2 and area 3 are at 5 feet.
✦ The tops of the castle walls and what remains of 
the central keep (area 12) are at 20 feet.
✦ The tops of the tower walls are at 40 feet.
Approaching the Castle
When the PCs approach the castle, read:
The castle ruins sit atop a steep hill, a broken crown on the 
head of an aging monarch. Many of the walls have crum-
bled, and several of the towers have all but collapsed, yet the 
place still has a heavy sense of weight, stability, and power. 
 
A single bridge of stone, extending from a nearby hill-
side, is the obvious means of access.
Area 1: The Arch of Stone
Built with defense in mind, Castle Korvald has only a 
single entrance—or at least, such was the case when it 
was intact.
When the PCs approach the bridge, read:
Held aloft by a series of stone pylons, the bridge is 20 feet 
in width. Despite its age and the ruined condition of the 
castle, the bridge appears stable enough.
Area 2: Tower of Entry
A heavy wooden door once stood in the western 
archway, but the hinges have long since rotted away, 
leaving two sides of the tower wide open.
When the PCs enter the tower, read:
The tower stands open, both to the bridge and to a stone 
walkway that leads to a second tower and the castle proper. 
The interior of the tower is open down to the floor.
Perception Check
DC 16: At various heights on the wall are the remains of 
wooden planks. Apparently, this tower was once divided 
into two or three levels. No more.
About 25 feet up the walls, a series of secret panels 
hide niches that contain a quartet of homunculi. The 
PCs can find the panels only by climbing the walls to 
that height and making a DC 26 Perception check.

THE RUINS OF CASTLE KORVALD
Unless discovered, the homunculi do not activate 
until the PCs approach the portcullis that guards 
area 3.
Area 3: The Gates of Korvald 
(Level 5)
Unlike those in area 2, the old defenses of this tower 
are still functional.
If the PCs approach from area 2, read:
The archway leading into this second tower is blocked by a 
rusted portcullis.
If the PCs approach from within the courtyard 
or atop the wall, read:
The door gradually opens with a screech of rusted hinges 
and a puff of dust.
Perception Check
DC 12: In addition to describing missing upper 
floors (as in area 2), read: Roughly 30 feet up on the 
northern wall stands a pair of doors. From what you saw 
on your approach, they lead out to the top of the castle wall.
The tactical encounter begins as soon as the PCs 
approach the portcullis or open one of the other 
doors.
 
On the inside south wall, just east of the portcul-
lis, a wheel of levers protrudes from the stone. This 
device raises or lowers the portcullis and requires a 
single standard action to operate.
Tactical Encounter: “The Gatekeepers,” page 98.
Secret Door: A secret trapdoor in the floor (found 
with a DC 21 Perception check) leads to a narrow 
underground passage that connects areas 3, 10, and 
11 to the open pit in area 12. (The passages are not 
shown on the map.)
Area 4: The Forge
Built for heavy use, the forge is one of the few second-
ary structures to survive the years.
When the PCs approach the forge, read:
A thin metal roof is anchored to the outer wall on one end 
and held aloft by a pair of heavy wooden pillars on the 
other. A thin chimney rises from a furnace beneath and 
protrudes through the ceiling.
The forge isn’t really a building, but simply a furnace, 
anvil, and workbench beneath the aforementioned 
roof.
Treasure: The ore, tools, and weapons have been 
removed. A DC 20 Perception check reveals a small 
niche dug into the floor, barely visible beneath the 
anvil. Within is a longsword wrapped in oilcloth. The 
sword is Serpent’s Tooth, a +1 vicious longsword.
Area 5: Cells
An old wooden door stands in the middle of the stone 
wall. Inside are cells, among the few interior rooms 
to have survived more or less intact. The cells are not 
open to the sky.
If the PCs open the door, read:
A short passageway features four more doors, two on each 
side. Unlike the outer door, these are reinforced with iron 
and heavily barred; apparently, they were meant to keep 
people in, not out.
Originally, these cells were family living quarters. 
When the defenders needed additional room for pris-
oners, they tore down the interior walls and added 
heavier doors.
 
Within are piles of withered orc bodies—appar-
ently, abandoned prisoners.
Area 6: Splinters and Stones
This room was once the bedchamber of the castle’s 
steward and his family. This area is not open to the 
sky.
When the PCs enter or look into the room, read:
Bits of rotted cloth and chunks of wood that once were fur-
niture suggest that this half-collapsed chamber might have 
been a bedroom of sorts.
Area 7: Broken Tower
This is the most run down of the castle’s towers. It 
lacks the homunculi and is in far worse shape, but it 
is functionally similar to the tower in area 3.
 
Passages once leading to the top of the castle walls 
to the north and an underground passage connect-
ing the tower to area 12 are filled in with collapsed 
rubble.
Area 8: Storeroom
Formerly one of the castle’s major storerooms, this 
chamber is now completely exposed. This area is not 
open to the sky; the PCs can walk directly over it atop 
the castle walls.
When the PCs enter or look into the room, read:
Fallen shelves, broken tables, and a smattering of moldy 
barrels suggest that this was once a supply room of some 
sort. It’s hard to imagine that anything worthwhile has sur-
vived the long exposure to the elements.

Area 9: Midden Pit
This hole is where the castle inhabitants dumped 
their refuse; the dragon now uses it for the same 
purpose.
When the PCs draw near, read:
This great hole in the ground is surrounded by a stone 
ledge, perhaps 2 feet in height. Even from yards away, you 
can smell the hideous tang of old garbage and rotting meat.
The hole narrows to only a few feet in width, curves 
throughout the hillside, and opens up about 10 feet 
off the ground on the northwest side of the hill.
 
If a PC enters the pit, roll an attack, +5 vs. Fortitude. 
If the attack succeeds, nausea imposes a –2 penalty to 
the character’s attack rolls and checks (save ends).
Optional: Bugs!
Level 4 Encounter (XP 950)
✦ 2 carrion crawlers (level 7 controller)
✦ 1 rat scarab swarm (level 8 soldier)
If the PCs poke around inside the hole, they disturb 
the pit’s inhabitants.
Area 10: Spire of Ice (Level 5)
Here, in the northeast tower, the dragon makes his 
home.
As the PCs approach the tower, read:
From outside, this tower appears very much like the others. 
It is run down, crumbling in a few spots and open to the air 
in others, but still structurally sound overall.
In most respects (except for the encounter and the 
lack of a door into the courtyard), this tower is identi-
cal to the one in area 3.
 
As soon as a PC enters the tower, the tactical 
encounter triggers.
Tactical Encounter: “Tower of Murderous Ice,” 
page 100.
Khekolak is not alone when the PCs confront 
him. In addition to the iron defender that serves as 
his constant guardian while he is home, the dragon 
is currently playing host to Vruhk, an emissary 
from the Frozen Skull tribe of orcs. Though still not 
strong enough to take on the town again, the orcs 
have been in contact with the new lord of Castle Kor-
vald, hoping to negotiate permission to hunt in his 
territory.
Secret Door: A secret trapdoor in the floor leads 
to a narrow underground passage that connects areas 
3, 10, and 11 to the open pit in area 12. (The passages 
are not shown on the map.) See the “Tower of Mur-
derous Ice” encounter for details.
 
Treasure: Khekolak keeps his treasure directly 
beneath the trapdoor. The hoard includes roughly 
500 gp in various coinage; a chipped ruby with 
broken bits of silver twisted around it (probably 
wrenched from a larger piece of jewelry), worth 
100 gp; an ivory-and-mahogany model of a galleon 
inside a small crystal bottle, worth 250 gp; and an 
old pair of wavestrider boots pulled off the body of a 
would-be dragonslayer. In addition, Khekolak keeps 
a potion of healing on him at all times; if he doesn’t use 
it during the battle, the PCs can acquire it from him. 
(This, plus the sword in the forge, accounts for half 
the magic items, half the gold, and one-third of the 
potions that PCs can expect to find as they advance 
through 3rd level.)
Area 11: Empty Tower
This tower has no inhabitants and no door leading 
out into the courtyard, but otherwise it is functionally 
similar to the tower in area 3.
Area 12: The Crumbling Keep
The central keep was formerly the beating heart of 
Castle Korvald—its military center and last line of 
defense. Now it’s even more of a ruin than the rest of 
the castle.
As the PCs approach the keep, read:
A few dilapidated walls and piles of rubble are all that 
remain of a once-mighty building. Given the thickness of the 
walls and the arrow slits fitted carefully between the stones, 
you might assume that this used to be the central keep.
 
At the ruin’s northern end, a rough hole almost 10 feet 
in diameter extends down into darkness.
The hole descends 15 feet to the intersection of four 
underground passages. Three lead to areas 3, 10, and 
11. A fourth leads toward area 7, but it ends about a 
third of the way to that tower, filled in with rubble 
and collapsed earth.
Optional: There’s Always Room for . . .
Level 3 Encounter (XP 800)
✦ 2 gelatinous cubes (level 5 elite brute)
Khekolak herded two gelatinous cubes up from the 
depths of the midden pit and deposited them here. 
They know enough to stay out of his way, but they 
attack anything else in the tunnels.
Area 13: Ramping Up
These ramps provide access to the tops of the walls. 
The ramps qualify as difficult terrain to those moving 
up, but not to those moving down. Rough and broken, 
the tops of the walls are difficult terrain.

2 arbalesters (A)
2 iron defenders (D)
2 stone harriers (H)
Khekolak discovered the lingering secrets of Castle 
Korvald, including the hidden command words for 
the fortress’s animated guardians.
 
If the PCs approach the castle by means of the 
bridge, they inevitably pass between towers 2 and 3, 
only to find their way blocked by the rusty portcullis. 
Provide the read-aloud text, then place two arbal-
esters as shown on the map. Four other creatures 
are in area 2, but it is highly unlikely that the PCs 
detect them until they attack, as detailed in the room 
description. If the PCs do not notice the arbalesters 
before they attack (see Perception Check, below), they 
are surprised.
 
After the players roll initiative, they likely focus 
their attention on the arbalesters behind the port-
cullis. Only then do the iron defenders and stone 
harriers appear from behind.
Perception Check
DC 16: Several creatures move about in the shadows 
behind the portcullis. Clearly, the chamber beyond is not 
uninhabited.
When one or more PCs approach the portcullis, 
read:
From the shadows beyond the iron bars, a pair of peculiar 
devices clatters into view. Wooden tripods with metal-shod 
feed skitter forward like insects. Atop each device, an enor-
mous crossbow swivels about until the rusty quarrels aim 
squarely at you.
When the other homunculi enter combat, read:
As bolts whistle through the air, launched from beyond the 
portcullis, a quartet of dark figures drops from the shadowy 
heights of the tower behind you. Two appear to be horrible 
hunting hounds of wrought iron, and the others are spike-
bedecked humanoids of stone, roughly the size of halflings. 
With a stiff, halting gait, like marionettes in the hands of a 
poor puppeteer, they advance on you.

THE RUINS OF CASTLE KORVALD
Tactics
Although the homunculi are not particularly intel-
ligent, Khekolak has bequeathed them a competent 
battle strategy.
Round 1: The arbalesters launch bolts as soon as 
any of the PCs approach the portcullis. If the iron 
defenders or stone harriers roll higher initiative than 
the arbalesters, they delay until after the arbalesters 
have fired. At that point, they drop from their con-
cealed alcoves in area 2 and move to attack the party.
 
The iron defenders remain close enough to the 
stone harriers to take advantage of their guard creature 
ability. The harriers make every effort to immobilize 
the PCs, leaving them vulnerable to the arbalesters.
Round 2+: The arbalesters act as in round 1, 
while the defenders and harriers focus their attacks 
on any PCs who make a concentrated effort to open 
or bypass the portcullis. The fall from the raised path-
way to the hilltop is negligible, but if any PC draws 
near the edge of the hill, the homunculi attempt to 
bull rush him over the edge.
Features of the Area
 
Illumination: This encounter takes place on the 
open stone walkway, so the illumination corresponds 
to the time of day.
 
Cliff: Anyone who falls (or is pushed) off the edge of 
the hill falls 30 feet and takes normal falling damage.
 
Doorways: In addition to the doors marked on the 
map, which lead to the top of the wall (see area 13), 
the tower in area 3 also has a large door at ground 
level that leads into the courtyard. All the doors here 
are brittle and weak; though they are barred, they are 
treated as standard wooden doors (DC 16 to break 
through).
 
Portcullis: The bars of the portcullis are not close 
enough together to provide cover against ranged 
attacks, but they prevent melee combatants from 
reaching the arbalesters. Although made of iron, the 
portcullis and its gears have been weakened through 
years of neglect. It requires only a DC 18 Strength 
check to lift.
 
Precarious Walkways: The open tops of the 
towers are wide enough to walk on and even fight 
from, but they are old and crumbling. They are con-
sidered difficult terrain. Maneuvering atop these 
walls requires a DC 11 Acrobatics check.
 
Secret Door: A secret trapdoor in the floor (found 
with a DC 21 Perception check) leads to a narrow 
underground passage that connects areas 3, 10, and 
11 to the open pit in area 12. (The passages are not 
shown on the map.)
Conclusion
After the homunculi have been destroyed, the PCs 
can safely advance farther into the ruins of Castle 
Korvald.
BEHIND ENEMY LINES
If the PCs enter Castle Korvald by climbing the hillside, 
they might approach this encounter from inside the castle 
rather than from the bridge. If this occurs, one arbalester 
spends the first round attempting to hold off the PCs 
while the other uses a foot to turn the crank on the port-
cullis, opening it and allowing the defenders and harriers 
to enter. From this point, they engage the PCs as best as 
they can without the advantage of the portcullis.
 
Similarly, if the PCs discover the hidden homunculi in 
area 2 before they approach the portcullis, the defenders 
and harriers leap down and attack. Meanwhile, the arba-
lesters take shots as targets make themselves visible.

1 iron defender (D)
1 orc raider (R)
Khekolak lairs in a crumbling tower partly open 
to the air. He lurks with his iron defender and an 
emissary of the Frozen Skull orc tribe. Provide the 
read-aloud text, then place the orc raider and the iron 
defender as shown on the map. The dragon is pres-
ent but currently unseen, lurking beneath the hidden 
trapdoor. Place him on the map only after he appears.
When one or more PCs enter or look into the 
tower, read:
Feral snarls sound through the chilled air. A fearsome 
humanoid steps forward, its gray hide covered in coarse 
hair, its apelike face hidden behind a skull tattoo of deep 
blue. It clasps an iron greataxe. Behind the creature, a wolf-
sized hound sculpted of black iron tenses as though ready 
to lunge.
When Khekolak bursts from the trapdoor, read:
The floor explodes outward as a horse-sized mass of freez-
ing fury erupts into the tower, carried aloft by rapidly 
beating white wings.

Tactics
Khekolak is not greatly experienced, but he has spent 
a long time deciding what he might do in case of 
attack.
Round 1: The white dragon bursts out of the trap-
door and flies straight up to a height of 20 feet (as 
high as he can reach in a single move, due to having 
to squeeze through the trapdoor). From there, he 
breathes on as much of the party as he can without 
catching his allies in the blast.
 
The orc and the homunculus charge into melee, 
though they attempt to stay at the periphery of the 
group, leaving room for the dragon to breathe. If at all 
possible, they focus on a single PC (flanking if space 
allows), unless doing so causes one of them to be 
flanked in turn.
Round 2: Khekolak drops to the ground and 
engages in melee with the PCs. The young white 
is looking to prove himself; thus, he attacks the 
toughest-looking martial character, rather than a 
more tactically sound enemy. The orc and the iron 
defender continue to fight, though the homunculus 
tries to move to the dragon’s side.
Round 3+: The white dragon remains in melee 
combat (though he switches to his breath weapon in 
any round when it recharges, and uses frightful pres-
ence when he can hit the greatest number of enemies) 
until he is bloodied. On his first turn after being 
bloodied, Khekolak takes to the air, hoping to lure the 
party after him and move the fight outside or into the 
courtyard. When he is out in the open, the dragon 
attempts to stay near the edge of the party, landing to 
deliver melee attacks against a lone character, then 
taking off once more if the others approach. He con-
tinues to fight, alternating between these hit-and-run 
melee attacks and his breath weapon (when possible), 
until reduced to 10 hit points. If that occurs, the 
dragon attempts to flee, either flying off into the sky 
or diving into the hidden passage, whichever seems 
most tactically advantageous.
 
The orc and the iron defender continue to fight 
until slain.
Features of the Area
 
Illumination: This encounter takes place in a 
ruined tower, so the illumination corresponds to the 
time of day.
 
Cliff: Anyone who falls (or is pushed) off the 
edge of the hill falls 30 feet and takes normal falling 
damage.
 
Doorways: The doorways lead to the top of the 
wall (see area 13). They are brittle and weak; though 
they are barred, they are treated as standard wooden 
doors (DC 16 to break through).
 
Precarious Walkways: The open tops of the 
towers are wide enough to walk on and even fight 
from, but they are old and crumbling. They are con-
sidered difficult terrain. Maneuvering atop these 
walls requires a DC 11 Acrobatics check.
 
Secret Door: A secret trapdoor in the floor leads 
to a narrow underground passage that connects areas 
3, 10, and 11 to the open pit in area 12. (The pas-
sages are not shown on the map.) Normally, the DC 
to detect this secret door is 24, but because Khekolak 
left it open a crack to peer through, the DC is 22 
before the fight. After the dragon emerges, the trap-
door can be found automatically.
Conclusion
Upon the death or defeat of Khekolak, the town of 
Yevn Raeach is free of his depredations. The PCs can 
continue exploring the castle ruins, gathering trea-
sures and facing additional foes, but their ultimate 
objective is complete.
FROM BELOW
If the PCs approach the tower from the underground 
passage, roll a Perception check to determine whether 
Khekolak hears them coming. (If they make no effort to 
be stealthy, assume that he needs to make only a DC 10 
check.) If the dragon detects their approach, he waits for 
them on the surface, prepared to ambush them as soon 
as they emerge from the trapdoor (or to yank the door 
open and breathe on them if they start messing with his 
treasure). If Khekolak does not detect their approach, 
the PCs catch him curled up beneath the trapdoor. He 
still bursts through, taking the fight up into the tower, 
but the PCs might be able to launch a round of attacks 
before he can do so.

A lair for five 6th-level adventurers
For decades, the most reliable route through the 
Threshold Mountains was Durgen’s Pass, a high 
mountain valley defended by dwarf stalwarts and 
protected by centuries-old fortifications constructed 
on either side to stanch the flood of kobold raiders 
and goblinoid bandits. However, the days of prosper-
ity and safety have ended, the vigilant defenders dead 
or scattered, the walls and keeps torn down, and the 
route infested with despicable humanoids—for a new 
master has claimed these heights.
History
The Threshold Mountains have an unsavory reputa-
tion as a place haunted by tribes of kobolds, goblins, 
and worse. Descending from their mountain homes, 
the humanoids harassed the communities on the 
lower slopes, carrying off livestock and slaves in 
their near-constant drive for plunder. The situation 
changed when Durgen, a dwarf hero, came to the 
mountains with a company of bold warriors intent 
on reclaiming a lost dwarven city somewhere in the 
peaks. The residents welcomed the dwarves and 
promised to support their efforts if they would deal 
with the raiders and reopen the pass. After just a 
few years, the dwarves pushed back the infestation, 
cleared the route, and established themselves as its 
protectors in exchange for a modest fee from travelers 
and the ongoing support of the nearby communities.
 
The dwarves’ success ushered in a period of 
relative safety and stability for the area, and com-
merce flowed through the mountains once more. 
The ko bolds and other mountain denizens strove to 
remove the dwarves, sabotaging their work to main-
tain the peace, but each time, the creatures’ efforts 
met with failure. Nursing their hatred and filled with 
rage at the dwarven presence, the kobolds hatched a 
new plan to return the mountains to their rule.
 
The kobolds believed that the only way they could 
defeat the dwarves was to gain the help of something 
far bigger than themselves. What they needed was 
a dragon—specifically, a big, powerful, nasty dragon. 
To this end, a group set out to steal a dragon egg and 
bring it back to their mountain caves, where they 
could hatch it and raise the creature to serve their 
needs. Against all odds, the kobolds managed to pull 
off this feat. They found an egg in a gray dragon’s lair 
and brought it back to their tribe. However, before 
they could hatch the egg, its vicious mother, Caustrex, 
noticed its absence. By following the sour stink of the 
kobolds, she discovered their community and slaugh-
tered the tribe until only a few remained.
 
Caustrex might have quit her rampage and 
returned to her own lair, but she found the mountain 
caves to her liking. They were defensible, and the 
remaining kobolds could prove useful servants. She 
spared the survivors in exchange for their fealty but 
questioned why they had stolen her egg in the first 
place. The kobolds revealed their sorry tale. Sensing a 
threat in the dwarves and having no interest in allow-
ing traffic through her newly claimed mountains, 
Caustrex flew off to slay the defenders. She made 
short work of them, and soon after, the pass fell once 
more into the hands of the kobolds. The raiding has 
begun anew, this time to do the bidding of the new 
mistress of the mountains.
Environment
Caustrex’s lair sprawls through the cliff walls of a box 
canyon in the Threshold Mountains. The dragon’s lair 
has the following features throughout except where 
otherwise indicated.
✦ The canyon floor is relatively clear, but piles of 
rubble and scree scattered near the cave mouths 
as indicated on the map count as difficult terrain.
✦ The various rock formations outside the cave 
system and the cliff walls count as rough surfaces. 
Climbing them requires a DC 20 Athletics check.
✦ The cave interiors are stone but covered in a thin 
layer of dirt to provide good footing. However, 
the complex contains numerous elevation shifts. 
Climbing to a different elevation requires a DC 10 
Athletics check.
✦ All caves and tunnels are as tall as they are wide.
✦ All uninhabited tunnels and rooms are dark.
✦ The place stinks of soot and dung, mixed with the 
distinctive sour odor of the kobold inhabitants.
Approaching the Lair
When the PCs enter the canyon and approach 
the cliffs, read:
As you follow the swift river into the canyon, a thundering 
roar reaches your ears. Beyond two large rock formations, 
you see a pool of frothing water gathering at the base of a 
cliff wall, fed by a rushing torrent of water that spills down 
from a wide cave far above. Shadows cloak much of the 
walls, almost hiding the numerous pocks and dimples in 
its face.
The large towers of rock rise up from the canyon 
floor and cast much of the area into shadow. The rock 
formations form arches that provide shelter from the 
caves looking down from above. Kobolds watch from

several caves (areas 6 and 7) for intruders. If they 
notice the PCs, they move to warn their leaders in 
area 8. At night, light from cooking fires emanating 
from the caves grants the PCs a +5 bonus to Percep-
tion checks to notice the sentries.
Perception Check
DC 15 +2 per square between the PCs and the 
sentries: The PC notices a kobold watching from one 
of the caves.
Area 1: The Falls
The icy water thunders down to collect in a frothing 
pool. The overflow forms a swift river that flows to 
the west.
When the PCs approach the pool, read:
The falls tumble down from a cave about 70 feet above the 
canyon floor to collect in a frothing pool before draining 
into the river that runs out of the area. Pale fish flit about 
the pool, and crayfish crawl about its rocky bed. Fish bones 
and scales litter the shore.
Perception Check
DC 25: Although the shore is rocky, the PCs notice 
the signs of tracks all around. A DC 15 Nature check 
reveals that kobolds made the tracks.
Reaching the cave mouth is difficult. Water makes 
the rocks slippery, and a lack of handholds makes the 
going slow. Climbing to the cave requires a DC 30 
Athletics check.
 
Even if the characters reach the top, they must 
contend with the rushing waters. Navigating the 
water-filled squares requires a DC 20 Acrobatics 
check. Failing the check by 5 or more indicates that 
the PC falls and is swept over the edge to the pool 70 
feet below, taking 7d10 damage.
When the PCs reach the top, read:
Water rumbles from deeper inside the cave, following a 
channel cut into the rock. About 25 feet in from the edge 
of the waterfall, a raised shore stands 10 feet above the 
rushing water. Beyond, you see that dry ground flanks the 
waters farther inside the cave.
Climbing out of the water and up onto the shore 
requires a DC 20 Athletics check.
Area 2: Stepping Stones
Rainwater and snowmelt from the higher peaks seep 
through the rock and trickle through natural fissures 
and cracks, joining with other streams until they 
break through the ceiling here. The waters follow the 
channel until they fall to the canyon floor beyond.
When the PCs come within 6 squares of this 
area, read:
Two slimy stones jut out from the rushing waters, offering 
steps of a sort.
Perception Check
DC 20: The characters notice tracks on the shores. A 
DC 15 Nature check reveals that kobolds made the 
tracks.
Characters can leap across the narrowest part of the 
river by making an Athletics check to jump, or they 
can cross the waters by moving over the stepping 
stones. To cross the stones, a character must make a 
DC 10 Acrobatics check. On a failed check, the char-
acter is swept over the falls unless he or she makes a 
saving throw, in which case the character falls prone 
at the edge of the waterfall.
Area 3: Midden
The kobolds dump bones, offal, and other detritus 
in this large cavern. The smell is noticeable at the 
entrance to the area.
When the PCs reach the end of the passage lead-
ing to area 3, read:
The passage ends at a wide cave, the floor giving way to 
a 40-foot-deep pit filled with rotting carcasses, old bones, 
mounds of glistening dung, and worse. Crimson mold 
covers everything.
Area 4: Old Kobold Lair
This area once housed the bulk of the kobold tribe.
When the PCs enter this area, read:
Scattered throughout this large chamber are old sleeping 
pallets, the remains of cooking fires, and a jumble of broken 
crockery and debris. The ceiling is black with soot, and the 
air is heavy with the stink of charcoal. Brown splotches 
stain the walls, and the floor is littered with twenty bloated 
corpses, most half chewed by rats.
Heal Check
DC 10: A successful Heal check indicates that the 
kobolds have been dead for about a week. Most were 
torn apart by sharp claws or bitten in half. A few bear 
the scars of extensive acid burns.

104
C H A P T E R  3  |  D ra g o n  L a i r s
JASON A. ENGLE
Perception Check
DC 10: Cave paintings and graffiti cover the walls. 
The images tell the history of the kobolds, their failed 
attempts to oust the dwarves, and their plan to steal a 
dragon’s egg. A character can piece together the story 
by making a DC 10 Intelligence check.
DC 15: Searching through the room’s debris turns up 
110 gp and a potion of healing.
Area 5: Battlefield
This room was where Caustrex entered the kobolds’ 
lair. A dozen kobold defenders fought, but her breath 
weapon claimed most of them right away.
When the PCs enter this area, read:
Dark blotches cover the floor, walls, and ceiling. Broken 
spears and broken kobold bodies lay where they fell.
Perception Check
DC 15: The bodies were torn apart, but most also 
bear terrible acid burns, the flesh having been eaten 
away by a caustic agent.
Area 6: Sentries
Five kobold slingers watch the canyon from this posi-
tion. If they spot the PCs or if they are attacked, they 
run to area 8 to warn the wyrmpriest, and then they 
move to area 7 to make their stand.
Optional: Kobold Sentries
Level 1 Encounter (XP 500)
✦ 5 kobold slingers (level 1 artillery)
If the PCs manage to get the jump on the kobolds 
here, they can prevent the sentries from sounding the 
alarm.
Area 7: Vigilant Watchers 
(Level 5)
Eleven kobolds (six skirmishers and five slingers) 
watch the canyon, positioned in groups at the three 
cave mouths. The PCs trigger the tactical encounter 
if they attack the kobolds or if the kobold sentries in 
area 6 spot them.
 
Tactical Encounter: “Vigilant Watchers,” page 
106.
Area 8: Makeshift Camp
When the kobolds are not on alert, this room serves 
as their camp. If the PCs strike with surprise, numer-
ous kobolds are present, and you can run the optional 
encounter below. Otherwise, this room is empty 
because the wyrmpriest and four minions have 
moved to area 9 to protect the dragon, while an addi-
tional four skirmishers and four minions have moved 
to attack the PCs elsewhere or to reinforce their allies 
in area 7.
When the PCs enter this area, read:
A cooking fire burns in the center of this chamber, sending 
up plumes of choking smoke that gather and crawl about 
the ceiling. The eastern side of the room holds a latrine, 
and a narrow tunnel heads up to the west.
Optional: Kobold Survivors
Level 3 Encounter (XP 750)
✦ 1 kobold wyrmpriest (level 3 artillery)
✦ 4 kobold skirmishers (level 1 skirmisher)
✦ 8 kobold minions (level 1 minion)
Characters who take the kobolds by surprise might 
fight the tribe’s leaders here.
 
Alternatively, you could treat this encounter as a 
negotiation or intimidation skill challenge. If the PCs 
earn 8 successes, they win the challenge; the wyrm-
priest explains the tribe’s predicament and vows to 
stop raiding if the adventurers can defeat the dragon. 
If the PCs achieve 3 failures, they lose the challenge, 
and the kobolds attack.
Area 9: Dragon’s Grotto 
(Level 6)
The gray dragon dwells in this large cavern, plotting 
her next attack and examining her hoard.
 
Tactical Encounter: “The Dragon’s Grotto,” page 
108.
Treasure: The dragon’s hoard consists of 1 pp, 
193 gp, 329 sp, 2,410 cp, two garnets (worth 100 gp 
each), 10 ounces of dwarven perfume (worth 10 gp), 
20 casks of dwarven ale (worth 40 gp), and a level 7 
magic item.

CLIFFSIDE LAIR
Tactics
The sentries employ common kobold tactics, with the 
slingers staying back and the skirmishers rushing 
forward.
Round 1: The kobold slingers use their stinkpot 
special shots to weaken the PCs’ attack and move to 
put as much distance as possible between themselves 
and the adventurers. The skirmishers rush forward 
in groups of two or three to attack and then use shifty
to flank PCs to help their allies. The skirmisher at 
the westernmost side of the chamber makes Athlet-
ics checks to climb up the elevation shifts toward the 
PCs (see Features of the Area).
 
If any other kobolds are present, they support the 
sentries by positioning themselves to flank PCs so 
that their allies deal extra damage.
Round 2+: The slingers use gluepot special shots to 
immobilize the PCs, while the skirmishers use mob 
attack and flanking to bring down any remaining 
enemies.
Development
Combat in this room draws the attention of the 
kobolds in area 8. The wyrmpriest dispatches four 
additional skirmishers and four minions to attend 
to the threat, while he and his remaining allies 
withdraw to assist the dragon in area 9. These 
reinforcements arrive at the start of the third round 
of combat. If the PCs already defeated these enemies, 
having surprised them in area 8, no reinforcements 
arrive.
 
If the PCs have not already alerted the kobold 
slingers in area 6, it takes 10 rounds for them to join 
the fight.

Features of the Area
Illumination: All light in this chamber emanates 
from the bonfire.
 
Bonfire: The bonfire sheds bright light in a 
5-square radius. A creature that falls into the fire 
takes 10 fire damage, and ongoing 5 fire damage 
(save ends). The creature has a +2 bonus to the saving 
throw to end the ongoing damage.
Smoke: Despite the openings on the south wall 
of this chamber, the cave still holds a great deal of 
smoke because of the dung and dried bones used 
for kindling. Squares containing smoke are lightly 
obscured.
Elevation: The floor in this room is relatively 
flat, though it shifts elevation several times. The pas-
sage into the cave is at 80 feet, but the floor drops in 
10-foot increments to 50 feet by the time it reaches 
the western edge. Climbing up from a lower shelf 
to the next higher shelf requires a DC 10 Athletics 
check.
Conclusion
When the PCs reduce the number of kobolds to three 
or fewer, the surviving kobolds surrender. Characters 
who search the bodies and the room find a bronze 
idol of Tiamat (worth 250 gp), a potion of healing, and 
40 gp.
INTERROGATING PRISONERS
If the PCs take any kobolds alive, they can interrogate the 
captives. Conduct an interrogation skill challenge similar 
to the one described on page 79 of the Dungeon Master’s 
Guide. In this case, all the check DCs are equal to the Will 
defense of the kobold being interrogated. Winning a chal-
lenge against a particular kobold requires 4 successes. If 
the PCs achieve 3 failures against a certain kobold,  they 
can wrest no information from that prisoner.
Success: The kobold reveals the history of its tribe, 
the tribe’s relationship with the dragon, and the dragon’s 
name and capabilities. PCs who win a skill challenge gain 
experience for all the remaining kobold prisoners as if 
they had defeated the captives in combat.
Failure: The characters gain no helpful information.

notice them or when they first take their turns.
When the players finish placing their minia-
tures, read:
Illumination from a large hole in the ceiling shines down 
on a massive dragon covered in gray scales and thorny 
barbs. Its long tail, which ends in a pair of long spikes, kicks 
up plumes of dust when it twitches. A string of green drool 
spills from its oversized mouth, revealing its anticipation 
for the coming kill.
When the players spot a kobold dragonshield, 
read:
A slight warrior in scale armor hisses at you. The creature 
is armed with a longsword and a shield bearing a crude 
likeness of the dragon.

Tactics
The gray dragon fights without regard for her kobold 
servants and doesn’t hold back her frightful presence or 
her breath weapon if kobolds are in the area.
Round 1: Caustrex delays her action until two 
or more PCs come within 10 squares of her. At that 
point, the dragon flies forward and unleashes her 
frightful presence.
 
The kobold dragonshields not affected by the 
frightful presence move to lock down any frontline 
defenders, using shifty to maneuver in such a way as 
to put the PCs between themselves and the dragon.
 
If the wyrmpriest and his minions are present, 
he places himself within 10 squares of the minions 
(and within 10 squares of the dragonshields, if pos-
sible). After he has done so, the wyrmpriest uses incite 
faith to boost his allies’ hit points and goad them into 
action.
 
The kobold minions work together, swarming over 
any lone PC striker or controller within reach.
Round 2: Caustrex flies forward again, this time 
to catch as many PCs as she can in the area of her 
breath weapon. The dragonshields press their attack, as 
do the kobold minions. The wyrmpriest keeps back, 
hurling an energy orb at any defenders that he can 
clearly see.
Round 3+: As round 2, but Caustrex descends 
and attacks in melee, spending an action point each 
round. If she becomes bloodied, she uses her blood-
ied breath and considers retreating. The wyrmpriest 
flings energy orbs each round until an enemy comes 
within range of his dragon breath.
Features of the Area
Illumination: A large hole in the ceiling lets in 
ambient light, so the illumination corresponds to the 
time of day.
Elevation: The floor in this room is relatively flat, 
though it shifts elevation several times, in 10-foot 
increments. Climbing up from a lower shelf to the 
next higher shelf requires a DC 10 Athletics check.
Conclusion
The kobolds fight as long as the dragon is still alive 
and present. Caustrex flees if reduced to 25 or fewer 
hit points, flying up through the hole in the ceiling.

A lair for five 9th-level adventurers
For many creatures, the Feywild represents a refuge, 
an escape from the dangers of the world for the 
comforts of a pristine, untouched realm filled with 
peaceful creatures, gentle landscapes, and bounte-
ous joy. However, the Feywild is quick to dispel 
these expectations. Though the realm is as beautiful 
as many expect, it is also hideous in places where 
twisted creatures—dark of form, mind, or both—lay 
claim to pockets of the land to further their sinister 
desires and hatch wicked plots. For all its splendor, 
the Feywild is as dangerous as the darkest reaches 
of the Shadowfell and as capricious as the greatest 
depths of the Elemental Chaos.
History
The green dragon Razcoreth did not hatch in the Fey-
wild, but the plane’s spirit fills his dark heart. Wild 
and reckless, he spent much of his time in the world 
flitting through deep forests, terrorizing woodcutters 
and travelers, and harassing anyone who encroached 
on what he claimed as his woods. Razcoreth never 
intended to harm anyone; he just wanted humanoids 
to stay out of his home, and he used his powers to 
drive off unwanted guests.
 
Razcoreth’s presence and antics kept travelers from 
lingering in the forest. But as rumors of the green 
dragon spread throughout the neighboring lands, 
tales of his cruelty and violence grew in the telling, 
and it wasn’t long before adventurers descended 
on the woods to slay the beast. Razcoreth, who had 
never killed any of his victims, was shocked when he 
came under attack, stung by the arrows and spears of 
vicious humanoid warriors. He fled into the depths of 
his woods, beyond any map or knowledge of mortals. 
There, nursing his wounds, he called out to the spirits 
for aid, begging them to preserve his life. His distress 
captured the attention of an ancient fey spirit, who 
promised to help the green dragon in exchange for his 
devotion. Razcoreth gladly made the pact and gained 
newfound power and mastery of dark spells with 
which he could fight back against his enemies.
 
With renewed hope and inflamed anger, the 
dragon emerged from his forest home and spread 
death and misery throughout the woods. At first, he 
restricted his attacks to those who sought to kill him, 
but before long, he developed a taste for blood. Thus, 
when no more enemies would face him, he ranged out 
from his home to strike nearby communities, slaugh-
tering entire hamlets to feed his hunger for death.
 
Such wanton destruction could not go unnoticed, 
and the emperor of the humanoid realm responded 
with force. A legion of his best dragonslayers stormed 
the forest, sweeping through the woods in search of 
the elusive dragon. Razcoreth fought them as best he 
could, but there were too many swords, and he knew 
that if he remained, he would be slain. Once more he 
called out to the fey spirit, begging the entity to save 
him, and again the spirit answered, revealing a portal 
to the Feywild. Slipping through, Razcoreth emerged 
into a forest that was similar to his own but darker, 
somehow more alive and with a penchant for the 
same violence that now lived in his heart.
 
In the depths of these woods, Razcoreth lives still. 
Trapped in the Feywild, he has forgotten his original 
home, his former light heart a dim memory. He has 
fully embraced the verdant wonder of his new land. 
Using his talents for manipulation and the favor 
of the dark spirit that watches over him, he rules a 
stretch of woods far from the courts of the eladrin 
lords, mastering the land in a way that he never could 
in the realm of mortals.
Environment
Razcoreth’s den lies in the heart of an ancient forest, 
beneath an old fey hill not far from the portal that 
brought him to the Feywild.
 
The dragon’s lair has the following features 
throughout except where otherwise indicated.
✦ The ground is relatively flat in the vicinity of the lair 
and is covered with pine needles, which grant char-
acters a +2 bonus to Stealth checks to move silently.
✦ Clustered around the trees are wiry thorn bushes 
that scratch and pull at clothing and exposed 
flesh. Squares containing thorn bushes count as 
difficult terrain.
✦ Normal pine and fir trees grow throughout the 
forest. Characters standing in a space containing 
a normal tree gain a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex 
defense from cover. Climbing a normal tree 
requires a DC 15 Athletics check.
✦ The forest also has a number of massive trees. 
Each massive tree takes up 4 squares and provides 
cover to anyone standing behind it. Climbing a 
massive tree requires a DC 15 Athletics check.
✦ The forest is also home to gargantuan trees. These 
trees rise hundreds of feet into the air and have 
trunks wider than the diameter of many towers. 
Climbing a gargantuan tree requires a DC 15 Ath-
letics check.
✦ Along the river’s shore, the ground is muddy and 
treacherous. Spaces along the shore are difficult 
terrain.
✦ Much of the river is shallow water, which is difficult 
terrain. Deep water (indicated by the darker-

FEYWILD LAIR
colored water on the map) is challenging terrain, 
requiring a DC 15 Athletics check to negotiate.
✦ Illumination depends on the time of day. The 
canopy’s density blocks the sun, so even during 
midday, the forest is in dim light. However, the hill 
and the Lake of Dreams are brightly lit during the 
day.
Approaching the Lair
When the PCs approach the hill, read:
A grassy hill rises 80 feet from the floor of the ancient 
forest, pushing back the trees and ubiquitous brambles to 
drink in the sunlight. The hill is perfectly rounded except at 
its top, where a dark hole burrows into the earth. Tendrils of 
mist curl up from the pit.
Area 1: Circle of Stones
This stone circle was once a holy place where eladrin 
mystics gathered to commune with the land and with 
nature spirits and to conduct mysterious ceremonies. 
The circle was abandoned when Razcoreth arrived, 
and signs of its disuse are everywhere.
When the PCs approach the circle of stones, read:
Menhirs stand arranged in a circle around a flat stone 
altar. This place seems to be long abandoned; moss and 
creepers cover the stones, as if the land were reclaiming the 
rocks, pulling them back into the ground from which they 
came.
Although the mystics no longer come to the circle of 
stones, Razcoreth’s servants are wary of the menhirs, 
believing them to hold the spirits of deceased druids 
from another time. While the PCs remain in the area 
of the stone circle, they cannot trigger the Sylvan 
Allies tactical encounter.
Area 2: Lake of Dreams
The Lake of Dreams spreads far beyond the edge of 
the map, extending a few miles to the south. Here, on 
the lake’s shores, the PCs can sample its power.
When the PCs come within 10 squares of the 
lake, read:
The trees give way to a pristine lake, sunlight dancing 
across its surface. Through the clear water, you can see 
the bottom, which features a jumble of stones, aquatic 
plants, and fish darting back and forth or nipping water 
bugs. Weirdly, nothing disturbs the surface of the lake, 
not even the waters that feed it from the river that wends 
through the woods. When a fish, a bird, or even the 
caress of the wind brushes against the surface, it remains 
as flat as glass.
Soon after Razcoreth came to the Feywild, he used his 
powers of persuasion and his mind-altering abilities to 
take control of a number of fey creatures in the area of his 
new lair. Although they are not adversely affected (such 
as dominated), they have come to see the green dragon 
as their lord and king and gladly defend him. As the PCs 
explore the forest around the lair, they might trigger a tacti-
cal encounter featuring these minions. The encounter can 
occur any place outside the dragon’s lair and is triggered 
if any of the following conditions is met.
 
The characters damage a tree.
 
The characters make use of a teleporting tree (see 
area 3).
 
The characters start a fire.
 
The characters come within 5 squares of area 5.
The PCs cannot trigger the encounter while in area 1.

The water is enchanted with potent magic that affects 
the minds of intelligent creatures. Animals are unaf-
fected. Any creature with an Intelligence of 5 or 
higher that touches or drinks the water is subject 
to the lake’s effects. The river does not share this 
enchantment and functions as normal water.
Lake of Dreams 
Level 10 Obstacle
Hazard 
XP 500
The lake is beautiful and serene, but it is utterly still no matter 
what touches its surface.
Hazard: When a living creature interacts with the water, the lake 
places it into a deep and disturbed sleep.
Perception
No check is required to see the lake.
Trigger
 
Whenever a living creature with an Intelligence of 5 or higher 
touches or drinks water from the Lake of Dreams, the water 
makes an opportunity attack. The water attacks each round as 
long as the contact persists until it hits its target.
Attack ✦ Psychic, Sleep
Opportunity Action Melee
Attack: +15 vs. Will
Hit: The target heals 10 damage, and the target falls unconscious 
(save ends).
Aftereff ect: The target is weakened and slowed (save ends both).
Area 3: Enchanted Trees 
(Level 8)
Each tree marked “3” on the map bears a power-
ful, short-range teleportation portal connecting 
it to another tree noted with the same letter. (For 
example, tree 3A at the top of the map is connected to 
tree 3A at the bottom of the map.) Any creature that 
touches an enchanted tree instantly teleports into 
a space adjacent to its connected tree. Touching the 
second tree returns the character to a space adjacent 
to the original tree.
Tactical Encounter: “Sylvan Allies,” page 114.
Area 4: The Hole
A wide pit yawns at the top of the hill. The hole is the 
primary entrance into the dragon’s lair.
When the PCs approach the hole, read:
A 40-foot-diameter hole reveals the interior of the hill. Its 
walls are muddy and earthen, hairy with strange roots and 
twitching with beetles and worms. About 80 feet down lies 
the pit’s bottom, a morass of mud and brackish water.
Climbing down the pit’s walls requires a DC 15 
Athletics check. If the PCs try to descend quietly, 
they must make a Stealth check against DC 22 
(Razcoreth’s passive Perception score), modified 
by distance. If they fail, they trigger the tactical 
encounter.
Tactical Encounter: “Dragon’s Den,” page 116.
 
The pit’s bottom is extremely muddy and foul 
smelling. Characters sink about a foot into the muck. 
Each square at the bottom costs 3 squares of move-
ment to enter.
Area 5: Hidden Passage
A concealed passage in the side of the hill leads into 
the dragon’s lair. Finding the entrance requires a DC 
25 Perception check.
If the PCs find the hidden passage, read:
A narrow passage worms through the moist earth. Puddles 
of water spot the floor, and white roots hang down from 
above like hairs.
Area 6: Stagnant Water
Rainwater that falls into the hole collects in a large 
pond here. The water is dark and noxious, incapable 
of sustaining life. The pond’s bottom is a quagmire 
as well; it costs 3 squares of movement to enter any 
space containing stagnant water. Any PC who drinks 
the water takes 10 poison damage.
 
Characters who try to move quietly must make 
a Stealth check against DC 22 (Razcoreth’s passive 
Perception score), modified by distance. If they fail, 
they trigger the tactical encounter.
 
Tactical Encounter: “Dragon’s Den,” page 116.
 
Treasure: Hidden beneath the soupy mess is 
an old sea chest filled with 558 gp and 1,158 sp. In 
addition, the water hides four leather bags contain-
ing a total of 12,011 cp, a copper bust of an attractive 
female eladrin (250 gp), an amethyst (100 gp), and a 
brilliant emerald (1,000 gp). Finding the chest, bags, 
bust, and gems each requires a DC 15 Perception 
check.
Area 7: Razcoreth’s Den 
(Level 10)
Razcoreth lurks in the largest chamber beneath the 
hill. He excavated the tunnels, and the walls still bear 
the claw marks of his digging.
When the PCs enter the den, read:
The wide cavern expands into a massive area of excavated 
earth. A central column of dirt and stone supports the 
earthen ceiling overhead. Strange purple roots emerge 
from the column, twitching as if alive. The floor and walls 
are packed mud and earth, with puddles of water scattered 
throughout.
Unless the PCs attracted the dragon’s attention ear-
lier, they encounter him here.

Since this encounter can occur anywhere on the 
overall map, the tactical map provided represents 
only one possible location. If you use the tactical map, 
place miniatures for the creatures that the PCs can 
see.
 
If the encounter occurs elsewhere in the forest, 
adjust the tactical map accordingly. Place the dryad 
near a gargantuan tree, and place the four hama-
dryads near her and each other. Place the eladrin 
twilight incanter close to an enchanted massive tree 
if possible, and place the two eladrin fey knights 
within 4 squares of her.
 
The players can place their miniatures in the setup 
area as marked on the tactical map or in a similar 
location on your adjusted map.
When the PCs see the dryad and any hamadry-
ads, read:
A female composed of wood and bark separates herself 
from a tree as similar creatures emerge from the forest all 
around her. She glares at you and whispers a dire curse in 
Elven.
When the PCs see the eladrin, read:
Emerging from the forest are a pair of eladrin warriors 
and an eladrin witch. The warriors wear chain armor 
constructed to look like interlocking leaves and wield long-
swords of green steel. The witch wears a long robe of woven 
roots and leaves and wields a rune-inscribed spear. She 
screeches at you and commands her warriors to engage.
Perception Check
DC 16: The PCs notice a hamadryad if she’s hidden.
DC 17: The PCs notice the twilight incanter if she’s 
hidden.
DC 19: The PCs notice a fey knight if he’s hidden.

Tactics
Razcoreth’s servants are fanatically loyal and regard 
any intruders into their domain as dire enemies.
Round 1: The hamadryads move to engage the 
PCs, splitting into two groups. The dryad delays her 
action until after the PCs take their turns. She then 
uses treestride to teleport from the gargantuan tree to 
a tree close to a lone PC, at which point she uses her 
claw attack.
 
The eladrin fey knights advance and take the total 
defense action to protect the twilight incanter. Mean-
while, their mistress advances with them and readies 
an action to use binding bolt at the first PC who comes 
within 10 squares of her.
Round 2+: The dryad and hamadryads press their 
attacks against the PCs, the former using treestride to 
dart around the battlefield, and the latter relying on 
their grasping roots aura to slow down the PCs.
 
The fey knights advance each round and use 
the total defense action until they come within 10 
squares of an enemy, at which point they use Feywild 
challenge to mark their enemies. Each round thereaf-
ter, they use stab of the entangling wild.
 
The incanter keeps back, using ranged attacks to 
harass the PCs. She alternates between binding bolt to 
hit enemies engaged with her knights and teleporting 
bolt to send enemies back into the claws of the hama-
dryads. If any enemy comes within 3 squares of her, 
she uses dazzling blast and then fey step to slip away.
Development
Each round that the combat continues, have 
Razcoreth make a DC 30 Perception check. If he suc-
ceeds, he joins the fight 1d3 rounds later. He uses the 
tactics described in the “Dragon’s Den” encounter on 
the next page.
Features of the Area
The area has all the features described under “Envi-
ronment” on page 110.

Setup
Razcoreth (R)
Encounter Level up to 13th, add:
any surviving allies (see “Development,” below)
This tactical encounter can occur anywhere inside 
the hill and is triggered whenever Razcoreth hears 
the PCs approach. The tactical map identifies his 
starting position. When the encounter is triggered, 
he makes a Stealth check to move quietly each round 
until he confronts the PCs.
When the PCs first see Razcoreth, read:
Emerging from the gloom of the cavern is a mighty green 
dragon, its long body covered in a fine mesh of emerald 
scales. Clumps of moss and tangles of vine cover much of its 
body, giving it the appearance of a thing of earth and stone 
rather than flesh and blood. Its red eyes glitter with malev-
olence as a cruel smile spreads across its reptilian face.
Perception Check
DC 20: A character sees or hears Razcoreth 
approach.

Tactics
His den is not an ideal battlefield, so Razcoreth 
reserves warlock’s leap in case he needs to retreat 
out of the hill. That said, he still has an impressive 
array of powers that make running this encounter 
challenging.
 
Round 1: Razcoreth maneuvers to put the PCs in 
range of his frightful presence. When two or more PCs 
are in the area of his burst, he uses this power. He 
follows up by using warlock’s curse on the closest PC. 
Finally, he spends an action point to use his breath 
weapon.
 
Round 2: Razcoreth keeps distance between him-
self and any defenders, shifting if necessary. He then 
targets a defender with crown of madness and spends 
an action point to hit a striker with curse of the black 
frost.
 
Round 3: Having exhausted the bulk of his offen-
sive powers, Razcoreth uses warlock’s leap to teleport 

117

JASON A. ENGLE
FEYWILD LAIR
to the other side of the PCs, if possible. Then he uses 
the rest of his turn to fly out of the hill to fight from 
the air outside.
Round 4+: Razcoreth uses flyby attack against 
characters who emerge from the hole. He uses luring 
glare to cause PCs standing near the edge of the hole 
to slide down into the pit, taking 8d10 damage from 
the fall.
Features of the Area
 
Illumination: It is dark within the den unless 
PCs provide their own light source. If the fight moves 
outside, the lighting corresponds to the time of day as 
noted on page 111.
 
Grasping Roots: In area 7, any character who 
ends his movement in a space containing the purple 
roots emanating from the central column is slowed 
until the end of his next turn. 
 
Stagnant Water: Areas containing stagnant water 
cost 3 squares of movement to enter. Any PCs who 
drink the water take 10 poison damage.
Development
The dragon uses tactics as described above, playing 
a game of cat and mouse until the PCs flee or until it 
defeats them. However, if any of its servants remain, 
the combat quickly escalates. Since a battle featuring 
the dragon and all his servants can reach 13th level, 
consider using the tactics below to give the PCs a 
fighting chance. Eliminate any tactical information 
that applies to creatures already defeated.
Razcoreth: The green dragon keeps to the air as 
much as possible. Taking a supporting role, Razcoreth 
swoops in to assist any beleaguered servants, using 
mire the mind to give him and his allies combat advan-
tage against the intruders. Razcoreth allows his 
servants to take the worst of the PCs’ attacks, support-
ing them from behind with his ranged powers.
 
If the PCs manage to defeat all of Razcoreth’s 
servants, he uses flyby attack until he comes close 
to being bloodied. At that point, he descends and 
engages the PCs in melee, using his claw and tail 
sweep attacks each round until the PCs trigger his 
bloodied breath. The dragon fights to the death.
 
Dryad: The dryad uses treestride to cover ground 
quickly and help allies that are hard pressed by the 
PCs. If the dragon is defeated, the dryad flees.
 
Hamadryads: After the dragon becomes involved, 
the hamadryads stick together and focus their attacks 
on a single PC at a time in the hope of keeping that 
enemy from engaging their master. They target con-
trollers and strikers if possible.
 
Eladrin: The eladrin fey knights are loyal to the 
twilight incanter, not to the dragon, so they stay close 
to her. They fight as described in the “Sylvan Allies” 
encounter, fleeing if the incanter is defeated.
 
The incanter moves to keep within 10 squares of 
the dragon each round. She uses her ranged attacks 
(with a preference for binding bolt) to pick off the drag-
on’s attackers. When the dragon is on the ground, she 
uses teleporting bolt to teleport enemies to the edge 
of the dragon’s reach. In her madness, the incanter 
fights until slain, even after the dragon is defeated.

A lair for five 16th-level adventurers
Deep in the Shadowfell, in the midst of several roll-
ing hills that overlook a gray and frigid lake, stands 
a neglected cemetery. The grasses, though brittle, 
grow thick here; the tombstones and mausoleums are 
wrapped in the loving embrace of ivy foreign to the 
natural world.
 
It’s a disturbing enough place, but hardly out of 
character for the Shadowfell. Yet this cemetery is 
home to more than creepy imaginings; it has become 
the lair of Tzevokalas, a fearsome draconic vampire. 
Even worse, the cemetery borders on the natural 
world, allowing the undead predator to flit back and 
forth, snatching prey from a village and returning to 
his Shadowfell home.
History
Nobody built this cemetery. Nobody dug the graves, 
nobody constructed the bridge across the icy river, 
and nobody sculpted the mausoleums from granite or 
marble.
 
No, this cemetery, like so much else in the 
Shadow fell, came into being as an echo of the natu-
ral world. It is a macabre and sinister reflection of a 
thriving town that, like the graveyard, is built par-
tially on a hill overlooking a lake.
 
The residents of the village in the world had no 
idea that a dark mirror of their town had come into 
existence—at least, not until the arrival of Tzevokalas. 
Who he was before becoming a vampire, or why he 
chose this region to hunt, nobody knows. But when 
he discovered that the village had been built up near 
a natural overlap between the world and the Shadow-
fell, the inhabitants’ fate was sealed. The beast took 
up residence in the graveyard and makes regular 
raids not only on the village that mirrors it but also on 
other communities nearby. He has done so for the last 
few months, and dozens of innocents have been lost. 
Given a year or more, the vampire might depopulate 
the entire region.
Environment
The cemetery in its entirety is enormous—larger by 
far than the village that it reflects. Only the portion 
containing Tzevokalas’s lair, the extreme northeast 
section of the cemetery, is shown on the map. Feel 
free to expand on this however you’d like if you want 
to set more encounters, or even separate adventures, 
within the graveyard’s borders.
 
You should break out every tool in your arsenal to 
make the graveyard a truly creepy place. Don’t play 
it up to the point of camp or distract the players from 
their goal, but never forget that this is more than just 
a large cemetery—it’s a truly unnatural place in the 
midst of an unnatural world.
 
Perhaps the best way to establish the mood is to 
make certain that the village “casting” the graveyard 
reflection is one that the PCs know well and have 
visited previously. As the adventurers work their way 
through the cemetery, compare their passive Percep-
tion checks to DC 21. If any of them succeed—or if 
the players specifically ask about the layout—they 
realize that portions of the graveyard are identical 
to the village in terms of overall layout. For example, 
where houses stand in one world, blocks of graves 
stand in the other. Shops and taverns reflect as 
aboveground tombs, and churches and government 
buildings as massive mausoleums. The overlap isn’t 
perfect, accounting for barely half of the cemetery’s 
design, but it’s far too close to be coincidence.
 
If the PCs examine the graves or mausoleums, 
the situation grows even stranger. The mausoleums 
and aboveground tombs lack names, crests, or any 
forms of identification. Each tombstone, however, is 
inscribed with the name of someone from the village 
in the natural world. The stones that belong to people 
who haven’t died yet are neat and tightly packed, as 
though well tended—at least, more so than the rest 
of the cemetery. But the tombstones of villagers who 
have died are surrounded by loose dirt, and their 
graves are empty, as though someone or something 
had clawed its way out.
 
Due to the hills and small cliffs that fill the region, 
various areas of the graveyard are at different levels, 
as shown on the map. The cliffsides that serve as the 
north and east borders can be climbed with a DC 20 
Athletics check. Each of the trees, all of which are 
dead, occupies 1 square. They provide cover and can 
be climbed with a DC 15 Athletics check.
Approaching 
the Graveyard
When the PCs approach the northeast portion of 
the graveyard, read:
The breeze blows cold, chilling the soul as much as the flesh. 
Though you can feel it on your skin and hear it whistle in 
your ears, the wind fails to rustle the dry, crackling leaves 
on the trees or bend the blades of grass that snap underfoot.
 
Ahead, a steep-sided hill rises before you, then falls dra-
matically away at the cliff that marks the cemetery’s edge. 
Atop its crest, you can see several more large mausoleums, 
as well as many more dead trees.

C H A P T E R  3  |  D ra g o n  L a i r s
WHERE SHADOWS FALL
Area 1: The Winding Path
Quite a few small footpaths wind their way through 
the graveyard. Only the main path, however, is spe-
cifically maintained; all others are overgrown.
When the PCs first spot or step on the path, read:
An abnormally wide path stretches through the cemetery, 
leading toward various large blocks of graves, as well as to 
the steps that climb the great hill. The path is sporadically 
scattered with pebbles—not enough to qualify as cobbling, 
but enough to keep the grass from reclaiming the route. 
Rows of weeds and thorny stems border the path, like a line 
of flowers planted by a demented groundskeeper.
Area 2: Gray Waters
The water here is slow, frigid, and potentially 
dangerous.
When a PC examines the stream, read:
The water is oddly gray, not dirty as much as simply darker 
than normal water. However, you can see the bottom, about 
10 feet down in the river’s center. The current is languid 
and slow.
If a PC touches the water, read:
The water is as cold as ice and vaguely oily to the touch.
Perception Check
DC 26: As the water rushes around the rocks and roots 
that cover the streambed, it briefly forms the suggestion of 
gasping, screaming faces.
Features of the Area
Slow-Flowing Water: The PCs can swim the river 
with a DC 15 Athletics check. The water is slow and 
the current is weak, but the chill and the oily texture 
make swimming a bit more difficult than normal.
Optional: Last Gasp
Level 13 Encounter (XP 1,600)
✦ 3 elite spectral tendrils (level 13 elite obstacle 
trap). Use the spectral tendrils trap (Dungeon Mas-
ter’s Guide, page 91) with the following changes:
Increase the Perception and Arcana checks for 
perceiving the trap by 2.
The tendrils make two opportunity attacks 
when the trap is triggered. If both hit, the target 
is immobilized and dazed until the end of the tar-
get’s next turn.
Increase the Acrobatics and Thievery checks in 
the countermeasures by 2.
If the PCs enter the water, the river erupts in an array 
of liquid tendrils that seek to grab all nearby. The 
tentacles attempt to hold victims under the water, 
causing them to drown.
Area 3: The Marshy Isle
Tiny islets stand in the river throughout the cemetery, 
but only one is near enough the hill to appear on the 
map.
When the PCs first approach the isle, read:
A narrow islet protrudes from the slow current. It barely 
breaches the surface, and its waterlogged surface is more 
swamp than soil.
Perception Check
DC 23: Several tombstones lie on their sides, all but sunken 
into the marsh. Presumably whatever graves once stood here 
have been washed out by the flow of water and time.
Features of the Area
 
Marshy Ground: The ground here is treated as 
difficult terrain.
Optional: Gaping Graves
Level 9 Encounter (XP 2,100)
✦ 9 horde ghouls (level 13 minion)
✦ 3 open graves (false-floor pits) (level 1 warder trap)
The fallen gravestones no longer mark the graves, 
which have become all but invisible beneath the 
murky water. A few open graves—basically, primitive 
pit traps—aren’t much of a challenge, but the ghouls 
lurking within are another story. The undead emerge 
if a single PC falls into a grave, or if the party spends 
more than a few moments on the islet.
Area 4: The Covered Bridge 
(Level 17)
This bridge is home to the region’s most deadly inhab-
itants (other than Tzevokalas, of course).
When the PCs approach the bridge, read:
A covered bridge spans the river here, allowing easy cross-
ing from one side to the other.
When a PC sets foot on the bridge, read:
The dark wood rafters above you are dripping with conden-
sation, but they seem sturdy enough. The water flowing 
beneath the bridge echoes strangely in the enclosed passage.
The tactical encounter begins when half the PCs have 
entered the bridge or when one PC reaches the far 
side, whichever comes first.
 
Tactical Encounter: “The Bridge,” page 122.

JASON A. ENGLE
Area 5: The Rising Stair
Only one portion of the hill is sloped; the other sides 
are veritable cliffs.
When the PCs approach the stairs, read:
A great stone stair leads up the slope of the hill. The steps 
are wide but shallow, and the stone is worn down by the 
elements. It shouldn’t be too hard a climb, but you wouldn’t 
want to have to run up or down the stairs.
Features of the Area
Stair: The stairs are difficult terrain.
Steep Slope: The slope is steep enough to require 
an Athletics check to traverse. A DC 10 Athletics 
check allows the climber to move up or down, but 
the slope is treated as difficult terrain. With a DC 15 
check, a PC can climb at full speed.
Area 6: Mausoleum
Each of these locations is more or less identical. The 
mausoleums, which provide cover, are 25 feet high 
and require a DC 24 Athletics check to climb. You can 
use a similar description—modified for size, and with-
out the tactical encounter or the hidden passages—for 
any of the smaller aboveground tombs in the cemetery.
When the PCs approach a mausoleum, read:
This structure is among the largest and most ornate of the 
houses of the dead in this cemetery. The granite might have 
been whitewashed once, but now it is a sickly gray, pock-
marked by years of exposure and wrapped in strands of ivy.
When the PCs first enter a mausoleum, read:
Other than being abnormally spacious, this tomb seems like 
any other rich person’s final resting place. A granite bier 
stands before you, bearing atop it an old, worn sarcophagus.
These mausoleums are not truly resting places for the 
honored dead, but disguised entrances to Tzevokalas’s 
underground lair.
Perception Check
DC 31: The bier and sarcophagus seem . . . odd.
Features of the Area
Doors: The mausoleum’s doors are made of heavy 
stone but are not locked or barred in any way.
Illusory Terrain: The bier, the sarcophagus, 
and the surrounding floor are illusions hiding an 
entrance to the underground lair; see area 7.
Optional: Long Way Down
Level 5 Encounter (XP 1,200)
✦ Illusory floor (false-floor pit) (level 15 warder trap)
Consider running the illusory floor as a pit trap, 
given how easy it would be for a PC to fall into it acci-
dentally. Use statistics for the basic level 1 false-floor 
pit (Dungeon Master’s Guide, page 87), but with a DC 
31 Perception check to detect the trap initially (as 
above), no means of disabling it, and a 50-foot drop 
(for 5d10 damage).
Area 7: A Hole in the Earth
Within each mausoleum, the illusory terrain hides 
a tunnel that drops straight down into the ground. 
Each passage is more or less identical.
When the PCs enter or look down into the pas-
sage, read:
A wide tunnel winds its way deep into the earth. You see 
no convenient means of descending other than climbing or 
sliding down.
The walls here require a DC 20 Athletics check to 
climb; though plenty of handholds are available, 
the earth is soft and crumbles easily. The passage is 
roughly 30 feet long, opening up into the ceiling of 
area 8, which is 20 feet above the floor.
Area 8: Below the 
Sleeping Dead (Level 17)
This chamber is Tzevokalas’s inner sanctum, as 
well as his means of accessing multiple areas of the 
cemetery. If you want to make the players nervous, 
subtly guide them toward wondering: If so much of 
the graveyard is a reflection of the village they think 
they know so well, what is the underground complex 
a reflection of?
When the PCs enter through one of the pas-
sages, read:
A series of open caverns fills this area. Roots and bits of 
broken coffins protrude from the ceiling, and small falls of 
soil drop like miniature waterfalls. Several caskets, mostly 
broken, lie on the floor, having fallen from the outer walls.
The undead that serve Tzevokalas dwell in several 
of the exposed coffins. One of the broken coffins is a 
fake, hiding the vampire’s possessions.
 
The PCs trigger the tactical encounter when they 
enter area 8.
 
Tactical Encounter: “The Dead Travel Fast,” page 
124.
 
Treasure: The PCs can locate the hidden com-
partment in the fake coffin with a DC 31 Perception 
check. The treasure includes a shield of defiance (level 
18), an orb of indisputable gravity +4, a small diamond, 
glowing with an inner light, set in a ring of sculpted 
shadow worth 7,600 gp, and 900 gp.

ate for their marching order. Provide the read-aloud 
text, and then place only the undead that the PCs 
have detected, if any—the bodak reaver, the horde 
ghouls, or both. The bodak skulks are invisible; even 
if the PCs detect their presence, their exact location is 
unknown until they resume normal form to attack.
 
The reaver and the skulks are clinging to the 
rafters of the bridge, hiding amid the shadows above. 
The two ghouls positioned on the bridge on the 
encounter map are clinging to the underside of the 
bridge. The other ghouls are hiding behind trees or 
clinging to the trunks.
 
The starting positions marked on the map are 
accurate only if the PCs spot the undead while 
they’re hiding. If the undead do not appear until 
they attack, position them as appropriate for the cir-
cumstances. The attack begins either when one PC 
reaches the far side of the river or when half the PCs 
are on the bridge. Any undead not detected by the 
PCs gain a surprise round.
When the bodaks drop from above, read:
From the rafters above you, a quartet of dark, murky 
humanoids drops to the ground, landing in an animalistic, 
four-limbed crouch before rising to their feet. Milk-white eyes 
glare at you above a mouth gaping in an eternal scream.
When the ghouls attack, read:
From beneath the bridge and around the nearby trees 
scrabble a horde of mottled corpses. Their mouths bulge 
with oversized fangs, and their claws click hungrily together 
in time to their predatory lope.
Perception Check
DC 21: As you set foot on the bridge, you cannot help 
but note signs of movement around the various dead trees 
nearby. (With this result, the ghouls by the trees do 
not get a surprise round.)
DC 25: You suddenly spot movement in the rafters above 
you, almost invisible amid the shadows. (With this result, 
the bodak reaver does not get a surprise round.)
DC 26: You just make out the signs of scrabbling below 
you, barely visible or audible between the slats of wood. 
(With this result, the ghouls clinging to the underside 
of the bridge do not get a surprise round.)
DC 32: Something other than the figure you’ve already 
seen skitters in the rafters above. You see nothing, but you 
can hear it—just barely—over the water rushing below. 
(With this result, the bodak skulks do not get a sur-
prise round.)

Tactics
The fight proceeds as follows.
Round 1: Each bodak skulk returns to its normal 
form and attacks a different PC, hoping to render 
several susceptible to being weakened by their death
gaze. The ghouls try to immobilize a character not 
already targeted by the bodaks. The reaper leaps into 
battle with its greataxe.
Round 2: If the bodaks have weakened at least 
a few PCs, they switch to gaze attacks in this round; 
otherwise, they continue melee, as do the ghouls.
Round 3+: The undead continue melee. If pos-
sible, the ghouls attempt to bull rush immobilized 
enemies into the river or over the cliff. Otherwise, 
flanking and mob attacks are the extent of their 
tactics.
Features of the Area
Illumination: The cemetery is illuminated by an 
unvarying ambient gray dim light.
Cliff: On the north side of the bridge, a cliff 
drops 50 feet to the lake below. The cliff face can be 
climbed with a DC 20 Athletics check.
Rafters: The PCs can climb up to the rafters by 
making a DC 15 Athletics check. The beams in the 
rafters are wide enough to fight from without requir-
ing further checks.
Slow-Flowing Water: The PCs can swim the 
river with a DC 15 Athletics check. The water is slow 
and the current is weak, but the chill and the oily 
texture make swimming a bit more difficult than 
normal.
Trees: Each of the trees occupies 1 square. They 
provide cover and require a DC 15 Athletics check to 
climb.

When they reach area 8, the PCs have a moment—
and only a moment—to get their bearings before 
combat begins. If they enter as a group, have them 
place their miniatures on the map. If they enter one 
by one, or if someone falls through a tunnel from a 
mausoleum, place only that PC’s miniature on the 
map. Provide the read-aloud text, then place Tzevoka-
las on the map, followed by the two sword wraiths.
When the fight begins, read:
From the center of the cavern, a terrible dragon takes to the 
air. Its flesh is dull, yet its eyes, though sunken, gleam with 
deathless vigor.
When the wraiths attack, read:
From the cavern’s shadows, phantasmal shapes flicker into 
being and make sudden, vicious lunges.

Tactics
Round 1: Tzevokalas doesn’t use his breath 
weapon initially; he reserves it until he has taken at 
least enough damage to benefit from regaining the 30 
hit points the breath provides. Instead, it focuses its 
hungry frenzy on one PC, then spends an action point 
to do the same thing again to the same PC. He com-
mands the sword wraiths to keep the other PCs busy 
while he tries to take down his chosen target.
Round 2+: Once he is wounded in subsequent 
rounds, Tzevokalas positions himself to use his 
breath weapon on the largest number of PCs possible 
(though not at the cost of opening itself to opportunity 
attacks). He does not care if his sword wraith allies 
are caught in his breath. If his foe manages to get too 
far away from it, Tzevokalas uses fly to feast to teleport 
right back next to the creature he has decided will be 
his next meal.
 
If Tzevokalas is reduced to one-quarter of his hit 
points, he takes mist form and flees the fight, order-
ing the shadow wraiths, if any are yet animate, to 
guard his escape.
Features of the Area
Illumination: There is no light in the tunnels 
underneath the cemetery aside from what the PCs 
bring with them.
Broken Coffins (area 8): These coffins have 
fallen from the surrounding earth and shattered. The 
squares are difficult terrain. The coffin marked “a” 
contains the hidden treasure.
Falling Soil (area 8): Several small cascades 
of soil constantly fall from the ceiling. These areas 
are difficult terrain, and anyone standing in such a 
square takes a –2 penalty to ranged and area attack 
rolls and a –5 penalty to Perception checks.
Ledge (area 8): The ledges in the cavern require a 
DC 20 Athletics check to climb.
Holes (area 7): Each tunnel drops 30 feet to the 
ceiling of area 8, which is 20 feet above the floor of 
that chamber. A tunnel can be climbed with a DC 20 
Athletics check.

C H A P T E R  3  |  D ra g o n  L a i r s
A lair for five 18th-level adventurers
In the depths of the Underdark, an elder purple 
dragon and his minions dwell in a complex of twist-
ing passages and almost organic contours. The people 
of the surface might claim that the beast is no danger 
as long as he stays below, but dwarves and other deep 
dwellers who have suffered his depredations disagree.
History
Only the eldest dwarf sage recalls that these caverns 
were once home to a clan of beholders that carved 
them from living rock. What happened to those crea-
tures, no one can say, but their home did not remain 
abandoned long. For over a century, the purple dragon 
Orukurtz has used the Heart of Darkness as his home 
and the center of his ever-expanding territory.
Environment
The stone floors are normal terrain, and ledges 
require a DC 27 Athletics check to climb, unless 
noted otherwise.
 
Scattered on the walls and floors are patches of 
phosphorescent fungus that infuse the area with dim 
light. As such, all squares not otherwise illuminated 
(by a light source the characters bring with them) are 
lightly obscured, granting concealment to creatures 
in them. The area descriptions and tactics discussions 
assume that the PCs bring a source of bright light with 
them (enabling them to see normally within the radius 
of that light, but also denying them concealment).
 
The caverns and passageways constantly twist and 
slope, running under, over, and around each other. 
Elevation shifts are shown on the map. The caves have 
stalagmites and columns, but none have stalactites; 
Orukurtz has broken them off to make flying easier.
Approaching the Caverns
Until the PCs enter the lair, nothing suggests that the 
caves ahead of them are different from those behind. 
The descriptions below assume that the PCs come 
from above (either of the two passages marked 1), not 
from deeper in the Underdark.
Orukurtz in Battle
The elder purple dragon is a canny strategist and 
rarely, if ever, engages in a straightforward battle. In 
some ways, the Heart of Darkness is not only a set 
of individual encounters but also a single running 
encounter with frequent interruptions.
 
In each encounter presented below, Orukurtz 
appears briefly several rounds into the fight. He 
launches a single round’s worth of attacks (or perhaps 
two, if the PCs try to impede his escape), and then 
departs again.
 
Until the end of the battle, use the dice to deter-
mine when and if the dragon returns, in the same 
fashion as determining when a power recharges. Roll 
d6; on a result of 5 or 6, the dragon reappears. (Do 
not roll on the round following his departure from 
the battle; the dragon is absent for at least 1 round as 
he makes his way through the twisting tunnels of his 
lair.) Each time that Orukurtz appears, his tactics are 
similar: He attacks briefly and then departs. Specific 
tactics are detailed in the encounter spreads; use 
these as examples to determine the dragon’s behavior 
in any optional encounters that you use.
 
Assume that each time the dragon appears in a 
single area, his breath weapon, bloodied breath, and 
frightful presence have recharged.
 
When the dragon reappears, he can do so through 
any of the entryways to the combat area. He knows his 
lair well enough to speed through it, and he appears 
from whichever entrance is most tactically advanta-
geous. Alternatively, he might phase in through a wall 
if doing so grants him combat advantage. Otherwise, 
he uses his phasing movement purely for escape.
 
Orukurtz never rejoins an ongoing combat after all 
the other monsters are dead. It’s easy enough to hear the 
sounds of battle—or lack thereof—so PCs who kill their 
opposition and then sit with readied actions, waiting for 
the wyrm to reappear, are doomed to disappointment.
 
Because of this running battle, each encounter has 
three possible level ratings.
✦ The initial encounter level assumes that the 
PCs spend most of their time battling the other 
creatures present, but that Orukurtz makes appear-
ances as described above. On the average the 
dragon fights for roughly one out of every three 
rounds, so this level treats him as a hazard and uses 
one-fifth of a level 19 solo’s normal XP (2,400 XP).
✦ The second (the lowest) encounter level is the level of 
the encounter if Orukurtz does not appear, whether 
because he has been slain, he has fled the lair, or the 
PCs have somehow blocked his access to the area.
✦ The third (the highest) encounter level is the level 
of the encounter if Orukurtz chooses to stay and 
fight, rather than continue to depart and come 
back. He does so if the fight is the last one remain-
ing in the lair—that is, if the PCs have defeated all 
other tactical encounters, as well as any optional 
encounters that you choose to include. (Other 
circumstances under which the dragon might 
stay and fight to the end are provided in the tacti-
cal encounters.) The PCs gain full experience 
points for Orukurtz (12,000 XP) when the dragon

HEART OF DARKNESS
is finally slain or defeated. That XP amount is 
included in this encounter level.
Area 1: Arteries of Stone
The PCs have entered the outer reaches of the Heart 
of Darkness.
If the PCs succeed on a DC 27 Perception check, 
read:
Barely visible on the dusty floor are occasional scuffs, bits 
of broken rock, and crushed fungi. These passages appar-
ently have seen a fair amount of use.
Area 2: Point of No Return
From this point, any light carried by the PCs becomes 
visible to the inhabitants of area 5, making it impos-
sible to catch Orukurtz by surprise.
Area 3: The Gauntlet
This cavern looks as harmless as the previous pas-
sageways, but appearances can be deceiving.
When the PCs enter, read:
The passageway broadens into a lengthy cavern. Sev-
eral stone columns stand beside the walls, dripping with 
condensation. Patches of sickly-looking mushrooms have 
sprouted in the damp earth, filling the air with a miasma 
almost like that of rotting meat.
Optional: Running the Gauntlet
Level 17 Encounter (9,600 XP)
✦ 1 purplespawn nightmare (level 17 lurker)
✦ 2 roper lashers (level 16 elite controller; use statis-
tics from “The Beating Heart,” below)
✦ Orukurtz, elder purple dragon, sporadically (level 
19 solo controller)
Perception Checks
Use these checks only if you plan to make use of the 
optional encounter.
DC 32: The PCs spot the purplespawn night-
mare. Read:
Lurking almost invisibly in the shadows is a sinewy crea-
ture of deep purple hue, crouching on all fours. Its skin 
flexes and flows like that of a snake, and its barbed tail 
twitches as it realizes that you have spotted it.
DC 36: The PCs spot the ropers. Read:
The faintest hint of movement and the light reflecting off a 
narrowly slitted eye suggest that two of the rock formations 
in this cavern might not be rocks at all, but living creatures.
Orukurtz has set up a surprise for intruders who 
think that they have found an easy way into his lair’s 
winding corridors. As in the tactical encounters, 
Orukurtz appears only after a few rounds of combat 
and continues to attack, depart, and return on a roll 
of 5–6 on a d6. Unlike in the tactical encounters, he 
never lands to engage in melee because the cavern is 
(for him) too tight for comfort. He attacks only from 
the air, and if the PCs demonstrate any capabilities 
(such as immobilizing spells) that might trap him 
here despite his phasing ability, he departs and does 
not return to this encounter.
Features of the Area
The following features likely affect play only if you 
run the optional encounter.
 
Odorous Mushrooms: Any living creature that 
begins its turn in this square inhales the fumes of 
mushrooms crushed beneath its feet. As a result, the 
creature becomes distracted, granting combat advan-
tage to all enemies, until the end of its next turn. The 
inhabitants of the lair have developed a tolerance to 
the fumes and are unaffected.
 
Sloped Floor: A square of sloped floor is difficult 
terrain if it is entered by someone ascending the 
slope. A sloped square is normal terrain if it is entered 
by someone descending the slope.
 
Stone Columns: Each column occupies 1 square. 
Climbing a column requires a DC 27 Athletics check.
Area 4: Central Overlook
Other than their heights, all these ledges are similar.
When the PCs step onto a ledge, read:
You find yourself on a small stone ledge, staring out over 
a cavern of truly enormous proportions. Your light doesn’t 
even begin to illuminate the entire chamber.
Feel free to add the description from area 5 if you 
think that the PCs would be able to see it, but keep in 
mind that they cannot see any of the creatures from 
this vantage point.
Optional: Flyby!
Level 9 Encounter (XP 2,400)
✦ Orukurtz, elder purple dragon, 1 or 2 rounds only 
(level 19 solo controller)
If the PCs remain on one of these ledges for more 
than a few moments, their light giving away their 
position, the dragon might make a single strike. He 
draws just near enough the party to use his breath 
weapon, then retreats in the following round. He does 
not reappear again in this location.

Area 5: The Central Chamber 
(Level 18, 17, or 22)
The center of the dragon’s lair is truly an astounding 
cavern.
When the PCs enter the chamber, read:
Many villages are smaller than this cavern. Even the tiniest 
sound seems to echo forever, and you cannot begin to see the 
far side.
When the PCs approach the center of the chamber, 
they trigger the tactical encounter.
Tactical Encounter: “The Beating Heart,” page 
130.
Development: If Orukurtz is slain, any surviv-
ing monsters from area 6 congregate here (as well as 
the purplespawn nightmare from area 3, if you have 
chosen to include the optional encounter there).
Treasure: Orukurtz’s hoard is hidden in a con-
cealed compartment beneath the stalagmites directly 
northwest of the crevice (area 8). The PCs can locate 
the compartment with a DC 32 Perception check and 
open it with either a DC 32 Thievery check or a DC 
27 Strength check. The hoard includes 40,000 gp in 
various coinage; a platinum crown with a mounted 
emerald worth 10,000 gp; a delicate chain of gold 
and mithral links worth 6,000 gp; a wooden chest 
containing two potions of vitality, a ring of wizardry, and 
a shield of deflection (paragon tier) that Orukurtz was 
hoping to have modified someday so that a dragon 
could carry and make use of it without penalty.
Area 6: Side Chamber 
(Level 19, 17, or 22)
This cavern is the quarters of Orukurtz’s servants.
When the PCs enter the chamber, read:
Though this chamber is not the largest you have seen, it is 
prodigious indeed—about a hundred feet long and over half 
that in width. Stalagmites and mushrooms litter the floor.
If the PCs make a DC 26 Perception check, read:
Beneath the scent of mold and fungi, the air smells faintly 
of wet dog.
The PCs trigger the tactical encounter if they 
approach the center of the cavern.
Tactical Encounter: “Something on the Side,” 
page 132.
Area 7: Yet Another Overlook
The ledge is identical to those in area 4, except that it 
overhangs area 6 rather than area 5.
 
If the PCs approach from area 10, the primal 
storm that normally lurks here quickly flies into area 
6. Allow the PCs a DC 27 Perception check to spot 
something moving up ahead.
Area 8: Falling Farther In
The edge of a crevice protrudes into Orukurtz’s lair.
When the PCs approach the crevice, read:
Ahead of you the ground gapes open, as though wounded 
in ancient days by the blade of an angry god. The shadows 
make it difficult to determine how far the crevice drops.
If a PC falls or climbs down the crevice, read:
The crevice descends about 40 feet to an uneven, rocky 
floor. Other than bits of fungi clinging to the floors and 
walls, there is little to see here. The crevice extends to the 
southeast, beyond the edges of the cavern above.
Optional: Creepy Crawlies
Level 17 or 22 Encounter (XP 9,600 or 21,600)
✦ 3 enormous carrion crawlers (level 17 elite 
controller)
✦ Orukurtz, elder purple dragon (level 19 solo 
controller)
The crevice isn’t as empty as it first appears. The 
scavengers in it have tangled with Orukurtz enough 
to know that they should leave him and his minions 
alone, but anyone else is fair game.
 
If Orukurtz is still alive, he appears here only if the 
PCs have already defeated everything else in the lair.
Features of the Area
The following feature likely affects play only if you 
run the optional encounter.
 
Odorous Mushrooms: Any living creature that 
begins its turn in this square inhales the fumes of 
mushrooms crushed beneath its feet. As a result, the 
creature becomes distracted, granting combat advan-
tage to all enemies, until the end of its next turn. The 
inhabitants of the lair have developed a tolerance to 
the fumes and are unaffected.
Area 9: Darkened Veins
These ledges emerge from the crevice walls but are oth-
erwise like those in area 4. The southern ledge leads to 
a passage that winds deeper into the Underdark.
Area 10: Down the Hole
This hole drops 40 feet down into area 5. From the 
top of the hole, the PCs can see anything that they 
could see from one of the ledges in area 4 (assuming 
they have an appropriate light source).

Tentacle Grab
 
The roper can attack and grab with up to two tentacles at a 
time. While grabbing an enemy, it can act normally, but it can’t 
use that tentacle for another attack. Enemies can attack the 
tentacle to make the roper let go of a grabbed creature; the 
tentacle’s defenses are the same as the roper’s. An attack that 
hits the tentacle does not harm the roper but causes it to let go 
and retract the tentacle.

Tactics
The PCs are in for quite a fight.
Round 1: The primal storm snipes PCs at range 
from behind cover.
 
The roper uses its tentacles to move PCs into the 
primal storm’s range, into melee with the minotaurs, 
or into clumps where the dragon can breathe on 
them.
 
Each minotaur charges the nearest enemy.
Round 2: Orukurtz flies into the cavern from 
whichever entrance is most tactically advantageous. 
If several PCs are grouped near his allies, he uses his 
frightful presence, hoping to leave them vulnerable. He 
might spend an action point to use his breath weapon
as well.
Round 3+: Orukurtz focuses on breath attacks, 
using his abilities as appropriate. The dragon flees if 
bloodied.
Features of the Area
Illumination: None.
Ledges: Multiple ledges (areas marked 4) lead up 
to various corridors or down into the crevice (area 8). 
A hole in the ceiling leads up to area 10.
Odorous Mushrooms: Any living creature that 
begins its turn in this square inhales the fumes of 
mushrooms crushed beneath its feet. As a result, the 
creature becomes distracted, granting combat advan-
tage to all enemies, until the end of its next turn. The 
inhabitants of the lair have developed a tolerance to 
the fumes and are unaffected.
Small Stalagmites: Squares that contain small 
stalagmites are difficult terrain. In addition, anyone 
knocked prone in such a square takes 1d6 damage.

Tactics
The fight proceeds as follows.
Round 1: The grimlocks delay until the hounds 
and the primal storm have attacked. The hounds 
move in to bathe as many PCs as possible in their 
fiery breath. Depending on where the primal storm 
started, it either remains on the ledge in area 7 or 
hovers above the stalagmites on the opposite side of 
the cavern.
Round 2: The hell hounds close to melee, flank-
ing enemies who are already engaged with the 
grimlocks. They shift back and breathe in any round 
in which their fiery breath recharges, regardless of the 
placement of grimlock allies.
Round 3: Orukurtz flies into the cavern from 
whichever entrance is tactically advantageous. If 
several PCs are grouped near his allies, he uses his 
frightful presence, hoping to leave them vulnerable. He 
might spend an action point to use his breath weapon 
as well.
Round 4: Orukurtz flees the chamber once more. 
If he can exit in a single move, he attacks before doing 
so; otherwise, he double moves.
Round 5+: Orukurtz reappears on a roll of 5 or 6 
on a d6, attacks once or twice, and departs. For the 
most part, he focuses on breath attacks.
Features of the Area
 
Illumination: None.
 
Ledge: The ledge in area 7 is 40 feet high. It 
requires a DC 27 Athletics check to climb.
 
Odorous Mushrooms: Any living creature that 
begins its turn in this square inhales the fumes of 
mushrooms crushed beneath its feet. As a result, the 
creature becomes distracted, granting combat advan-
tage to all enemies, until the end of its next turn. The 
inhabitants of the lair have developed a tolerance to 
the fumes and are unaffected.
 
Sloped Floor: A square of sloped floor is difficult 
terrain if it is entered by someone ascending the 
slope. A sloped square is normal terrain if it is entered 
by someone descending the slope.
 
Small Stalagmites: Squares that contain small 
stalagmites are difficult terrain. In addition, anyone 
knocked prone in such a square takes 1d6 damage.
Conclusion
The primal storm and the grimlocks fight to the 
death, the hell hounds flee if reduced to 5 hit points, 
and Orukurtz attempts to flee the lair if reduced to 
one-quarter of his hit points. If the battle ends while 
Orukurtz is absent, he does not reappear in the 
chamber.

TOMAS GIORELLO
A lair for five 19th-level adventurers
The Fire Peaks of the Sunset Sea are a chain of volca-
nic islands that mark the edge of the world. Few dare 
travel as far as these sinister islands because they are 
said to be places where cannibals, savages, and ter-
rible beasts are half starved for the flesh of the living. 
Although many fears held by those who sail the seas 
arise from superstition and ignorance, these rumors 
have a kernel of truth—the archipelago is home to a 
predatory red dragon.
 
Of the islands that make up the chain, Hellkiln 
is the worst. It is dominated by a vast, angry volcano 
that erupts several times each year; the geothermal 
instability builds up the island with lava belched 
from the depths. Inside the volcano, the red dragon 
Infernus makes his home, nursing old grudges and 
plotting his revenge for offenses from the distant past. 
Above, in slightly cooler chambers, his azer slaves toil 
to manufacture a doomsday weapon whose power 
promises to bring death and destruction to the drag-
on’s homeland.
History
Infernus has burned with an unquenchable hatred 
for humanity for as long as he can remember. Already 
an adult during the devastating wars between his 
homeland Arkhosia and the vile Bael Turath, he, like 
others of his kind, answered the call to battle. Infer-
nus took to the air to rain fire upon the tieflings and 
send their fiendish allies back to the dreaded Nine 
Hells whence they came.
 
He fought in war after bitter war, racking up more 
kills than the pathetic metallics and the easily led 
dragonborn. Though Infernus blamed the wicked-
ness of the tiefling breed for his own willingness 
to murder and destroy, he secretly exulted in the 
violence, and he always used more force than was 
required to spread as much ruin as he could.
 
But for all of the red dragon’s zeal in battle, his 
efforts were for naught. Treachery in the Arkhosian 
ranks—and the disastrous final conflict that saw Bael 
Turath swallowed up by the earth, along with count-
less dragons and dragonborn—spelled the end of the 
ancient dragon empire. Though the war was over 
and dragonkind scattered, Infernus still craved the 
mayhem of battle. He was not yet willing to set aside 
violence, so he turned to hunting humans, blaming 
them and their moral weakness for the death of his 
nation.
 
Scouring the remnants of Bael Turath, immolat-
ing humans, tieflings, and anyone else who got in his 
way, Infernus spread fear throughout the lands. It 
wasn’t until a cadre of wizards and warriors met the 
dragon on the field of battle and fought him for days 
that Infernus quit the land and fled for a safer place 
beyond the realms of the lesser races.
 
He flew until he came to the Fire Peaks. Choos-
ing the largest and most volatile island, the dragon 
descended into the caldera to nurse his wounds. 
To his surprise, he discovered that a clan of azers 
dwelled in the volcano, having fled the tyranny 
of their fire giant masters. Infernus saw the value 
of these diligent workers and quickly subjugated 
them. In exchange for constructing a great weapon 
with which he could gain revenge on his enemies, 
he would allow the azers a degree of autonomy and 
freedom—and, of course, their lives. The azers chafed 
at finding themselves in the thrall of another master, 
but they realized that they had little choice; even 
on the fringes of the world, they had heard of the 
red dragon’s dark deeds. They agreed to the terms 
and set out to build the weapon to their master’s 
specifications.

C H A P T E R  3  |  D ra g o n  L a i r s
VOLCANO LAIR
Environment
Hellkiln is a violent island, dominated by an enor-
mous volcano that is prone to erupt with unsettling 
frequency. The eastern side of the island is far easier 
to climb than is the west. The ground is rocky, pitted, 
and fraught with vents spewing steam. However, the 
approach is easy, and the ground climbs gently across 
smooth toes of cooled lava that become hotter the 
higher one ascends.
 
Hellkiln has the following features except where 
otherwise indicated.
✦ On the lower slopes, characters can move unim-
peded. However, within 15 squares of the caldera, 
the terrain is difficult.
✦ Outside the volcano, lighting depends on the time 
of day. Inside, the fiery magma at the bottom pro-
vides constant dim light.
Hellkiln’s Hazards
Hellkiln is a dangerous place to explore, and PCs who 
spend time here are at risk from quakes and fiery 
cinders. For every 10 minutes the characters spend 
on Hellkiln, there is a 10% chance that one of the two 
following environmental dangers occurs.
Quake 
Level 15 Lurker
Hazard 
XP 1,200
Geological instability triggers an earthquake that shakes the 
entire island.
Hazard: Every 10 minutes, check to see if this unstable island is 
jostled by an earthquake. 
Perception
 
No check is necessary to notice the quake.
Additional Skill: Nature
✦ DC 10: The character notices that the entire island is unstable.
Initiative +7
Trigger
 
The trigger for a quake is random and has a 10% chance of 
occurring every 10 minutes that the PCs are on the island. 
When triggered, a quake rolls initiative. After the trigger and 
before the quake’s attack, characters in the area know that 
an earthquake is beginning. On its turn, the quake attacks all 
creatures standing on the ground.
Attack
Standard Action 
Area island
Targets: Creatures in the area
Attack: +15 vs. Reﬂ ex
Hit: 1d10 + 10 damage, and the target is knocked prone.
Miss: Half damage, and the target is not knocked prone.
Special: At the end of its turn, roll a saving throw for the quake. 
On a success, the quake continues for another round. If the 
saving throw fails, the quake stops. 
Countermeasures
✦ A DC 23 Nature check and a standard action allow a creature to 
ﬁ nd a way to brace itself, gaining a +4 bonus to Reﬂ ex defense 
against the quake’s attacks.
✦ The quake does not attack ﬂ ying creatures.
Cinder Storm 
Level 15 Lurker
Hazard 
XP 1,200
The volcano lets loose a minor eruption, belching forth a cloud of 
fiery cinders.
Hazard: The capricious volcano shoots forth this cinder storm at 
infrequent intervals.
Perception
No check is necessary to notice the cinders.
Additional Skill: Nature
✦ DC 10: The character notices that the volcano is active.

Countermeasures
✦ A PC who succeeds on a DC 25 Nature check can successfully 
intuit the most probable intervals and areas of cinder storm 
strikes. This knowledge grants the PCs a +2 bonus to Reﬂ ex 
defense for the cinder storm attacks.
Approaching the Lair
When the PCs approach the island, read:
Smoke billows from the caldera of an active volcano, and 
flashes of light and the occasional burst of lava spew from 
its depths. The rest of the island is barren, a great expanse 
of black and silver igneous rocks, some smooth and ropy, 
others sharp and jagged. Piercing the crust are numerous 
mine shafts from which billow clouds of smoke, while rents 
and fissures belch similar plumes. All around the island, 
the sea boils, steaming as the ground is slowly built up from 
the depths of the sea.
Area 1: Black Shore
The island’s lower shores are mostly black sand, 
washed up after the seawater rapidly cools super-
heated rock from the ocean’s depths. The beach is 
free of plant life, and no tracks suggest that anyone 
has ever been here.
Area 2: Mines
The azers excavated three mines into the island’s core 
to extract minerals and ore from the cooled lava.
When the PCs approach a mine, read:
A massive hole burrows into the ground, descending nearly 
100 feet before ending in a shimmering pool of liquid rock.

Perception Check
DC 15: Although the walls of the hole appear smooth, 
closer inspection reveals that they were cut with tools, with 
uncanny precision.
Characters who fall down a shaft take 10d10 falling 
damage, and ongoing 20d6 fire damage upon falling 
into the magma and for each round they remain in 
the magma. Characters who extract themselves from 
the fiery mess take 30 ongoing fire damage and are 
slowed (save ends both).
Area 3: Vents
Hellkiln’s instability afflicts the island with frequent 
quakes, causing the rock to split and unleash plumes 
of steam. Any square within 2 squares of a vent is 
lightly obscured.
 
Each vent narrows as it deepens until it ends at 
a slender crack through which superheated gases 
escape. Each vent is 1d10 squares deep; a PC who 
falls in one takes normal falling damage plus 20 fire 
damage from the scalding gas in each round he or 
she remains in the vent.
Area 4: Caldera
At the top of the slope, the caldera rises nearly 200 
feet straight up from the island, forming a cylinder of 
stone.
When the PCs reach the top of the island, read:
The air is noxious here, and the stench is almost unbear-
able. Plumes of smoke spew out of this natural chimney, lit 
by flashes of light or the occasional wad of molten rock that 
is ejected from the cone and lands far out to sea.
Climbing the caldera is difficult and requires a DC 
20 Athletics check. The stone is hot and deals 5 fire 
damage per round to unprotected climbers.
After they reach the top of the caldera’s rim, the char-
acters can descend into the volcano.
Perception Check
DC 20: On the opposite side of the caldera, you spot an 
iron ladder descending into the volcano.
The PCs can move slowly along the caldera’s lip to 
reach the ladder, or they can try climbing down 
the walls or using another means at their disposal. 
Navigating the lip is slow and treacherous, requir-
ing a DC 10 Acrobatics check to move at half speed. 
After the PCs reach the ladder, they can climb down 
it by making a DC 10 Athletics check. The ladder 
descends to area 5.
 
Climbing down the wall without the aid of the 
ladder requires a DC 25 Athletics check.
 
Inside the caldera, the heat from the volcano deals 
5 fire damage to a character for each round he or she 
spends in the area.
 
A fall from any height is likely to be lethal, drop-
ping the character into the sea of fire (area 7). A PC 
takes appropriate falling damage plus damage from 
the magma as described under area 2.
Area 5: Crucible (Level 18)
This area is home to the azer slaves that work for 
the dragon, constructing the doomsday weapon that 
Infernus intends to loose on his former homeland. 
The azers have not completed the device, nor are they 
even close. In truth, they have no ill will toward the 
dragon’s enemies and are being forced to serve Infer-
nus against their wishes.
 
Characters who land on this ledge trigger the 
tactical encounter. Combat is the likely result, but 
the PCs might find a way to avoid that outcome. The 
azers protect themselves and the device, but they 
can be convinced to avoid fighting and even to assist 
the party. If you’d rather avoid depleting the PCs’ 
resources before they face the dragon, you can resolve 
this encounter as a skill challenge. Negotiation or 
interrogation are the logical approaches, but you 
could construct a skill challenge of your own design. 
Give the skill challenge a level equal to the PCs’ level 
and a complexity of 5.
 
Tactical Encounter: “The Weapon,” page 138.
 
Treasure: Hidden in the sleeping pallets are 
4,000 gp and five diamonds (5,000 gp each).
Area 6: Dragon’s Lair (Level 22)
Infernus dwells on a shelf just above the molten core 
of the volcano. Even a dragon as mighty as he could 
not withstand a full eruption of the volcano, but 
he is confident that he could fly out in time if that 
occurred.
 
Reaching the dragon’s ledge is challenging. The 
azers never descend that far and have no way to reach 
it themselves. The most difficult method is to climb 
down 100 feet from the lip of the caldera and then 
drop down another 30 feet to the ledge. However, 
PCs who are experienced enough to invade this 
lair probably have other means of transportation by 
which to reach the dragon’s ledge.
 
Tactical Encounter: “The Dragon’s Lair,” page 
140.
Area 7: Sea of Fire
The bottom of the volcano is a sea of magma that lies 
200 feet below the rim of the caldera. Characters 
who fall into the magma take appropriate falling 
damage plus damage from the magma as described 
under area 2.

Setup
1 azer beastmaster (B)
2 firebred hell hounds (H)
2 azer ragers (R)
3 azer foot soldiers (A)
Place the miniatures where indicated on the tactical 
map. The azer foot soldiers are at work assembling 
the device, so the PCs automatically gain surprise 
against them. The rest of the azers are entitled to 
Perception checks to notice the PCs approaching the 
ledge.
 
If the characters reach the ledge by climbing down 
the ladder, have the two PCs who descended first 
place their miniatures adjacent to the ladder. Place 
the miniatures of the other PCs off the map (adjacent 
to the edge) in the order of their descent.
When the first PC reaches the ledge, read:
The ledge extends 70 feet into the side of the mountain and 
contains a number of fiery dwarves laboring over a strange 
device. The item is a rough-shaped orb with four metal rods 
extending out from red metal plating. The device hangs 
from chains set into the ceiling about 40 feet overhead. 
Three figures stand on scaffolding that surrounds the 
device, constructed between large stone pillars that support 
the ceiling.
 
Against one wall, another fiery dwarf works at a forge 
near a stack of materials. You spy sleeping pallets against 
the wall farthest from the edge.
 
Just as you take in the scene, a mean-looking dwarf 
drops the chains that hold two large flaming hounds at bay.

Tactics
The azers are terrified of Infernus, so they fight to the 
death.
Surprise Round: Any azers that are not surprised 
draw weapons, while the firebred hell hounds charge.
Round 1: The azer foot soldiers climb down from 
the scaffolding and converge on the closest PCs 
to make basic attacks. The azer ragers leave their 
respective positions and join the fight by making bull 
rush attacks against PCs near the ledge. The firebred 
hell hounds use fiery breath, catching the azers and 
the PCs alike, while the beastmaster hangs back, 
using spur the beast to recharge the hell hounds’ fiery 
breath.
Round 2+: The foot soldiers press their attack, 
using warding flame to erode the PCs’ defenses. The 
azer ragers continue their bull rush attacks until they 
are bloodied, at which point they use chains of flame. 
The beastmaster tries to remain with 5 squares of 
one or both firebred hellhounds so that it can use its 
induce hellburst ability if it is bloodied.
Features of the Area
Illumination: Dim light from the volcano’s fiery 
magma.
Doomsday Device: The device has AC/Reflex 
3, Fortitude 15, and 300 hit points. Since the device 
is not yet completed, destroying it does not risk 
detonation. Characters standing behind the device 
gain cover. Four chains suspend the device from the 
ceiling. Each chain has AC/Reflex 10, Fortitude 5, 
and 15 hit points. After the device is dropped to the 
floor, the PCs can push it 1 square by making a DC 
25 Strength check. Each 5 points by which the check 
succeeds pushes it another square (2 squares with a 
check result of 30, 3 squares with a result of 35, and 
so on.)
Forge: The forge is a pool of lava. Characters 
coming into contact with the forge take 20 fire 
damage, and ongoing 10 fire damage (save ends).
 
Heat: This deep inside the volcano, it’s very hot. 
Unprotected characters lose one healing surge every 
minute they spend here. Inside the caldera, the heat 
from the volcano deals 5 fire damage to a creature for 
each round it spends in the area.
Magma: Beyond the ledge lies the heart of the 
volcano, a pool of churning magma about 100 feet 
below. Characters who fall into the magma take fall-
ing damage and other damage as described under 
area 2 on page 136.
Materials: The materials consist of raw ore and 
parts for the doomsday device. This area is difficult 
terrain.
Scaffolding: Climbing onto the scaffolding 
requires a DC 5 Athletics check. While on the scaf-
folding, a character cannot be hit by melee attacks.
THE DOOMSDAY DEVICE
What is the doomsday device? It can be whatever you 
want it to be. The weapon might be a terrible explosive 
designed to rain fire across the land, a magic construct 
that rips open a hole to the Abyss and unleashes a horde 
of demons into the world, or a dud that fails to function at 
all. How the doomsday device figures into your campaign 
is up to you, but its destruction is a useful hook to draw 
the PCs to the red dragon’s lair. Regardless of what you 
choose, pushing the device off the ledge into the magma 
below enrages Infernus and summons him from his lair.
 
If you’d rather not include the device, remove it and 
instead have the azers smelting adamantine ore into bars 
to add to the dragon’s hoard.

Setup
Infernus (I)
The lair is the most likely place to encounter Infer-
nus. Unless the PCs have done something to draw his 
attention, such as shoving the doomsday device into 
the magma, the red dragon is here, finishing a meal 
of a whale he snatched from the sea earlier in the day.
 
The players should place their miniatures at the 
edge of the tactical map, where the ledge drops away 
to the magma below. Wait until the PCs spot the 
dragon to place his miniature.
When the PCs reach this ledge, read:
The ledge forms a lip above the sea of fire far below. Ahead 
lies a huge cave, easily 100 feet wide and twice as deep. 
Stalactites hang from the ceiling 30 feet above, and a 
few massive stalagmites rise from the floor. In spite of the 
ambient light from the magma, gloom shrouds the cave’s 
depths.
Perception Check
DC 27 + 2 per square of distance between the 
PCs and the dragon: The PCs see Infernus.
When the PCs see the dragon, read:
A hulking horror unfolds from the floor at the rear of the 
cave. Although the creature is covered in soot and ash, you 
can clearly see red scales, white horns ending in black tips, 
and baleful eyes filled with yellow fire. It chuckles deeply. 
“Yes, come forward, so I can see you.”

Buying Time
Infernus does not intend to negotiate with the PCs, 
but he tries to buy time to creep closer and bring 
them in range of his frightful presence. He waxes on 
about how impressed he is that the PCs found him 
and comments on their courage for descending into 
his lair. He questions them about why they came, 
chuckling again if they mention their intent to slay 
him. All the while, Infernus creeps forward 1 square 
at a time until the PCs are within range. After combat 
begins, he rewards obnoxious or arrogant characters 
with his most vicious attacks.

141
C H A P T E R  3  |  D ra g o n  L a i r s
VOLCANO LAIR
Tactics
Infernus is a formidable opponent and well versed 
in fighting humanoids. He eagerly engages the PCs, 
reveling in the chance to kill. He focuses his attacks 
against humans and tieflings first, but he’s not foolish 
enough to ignore other PCs.
Round 1: Infernus lifts off the ground and flies 
forward, spending an action point to move twice and 
still use his frightful presence.
Round 2: Infernus hovers above the PCs and uses 
his breath weapon against as many characters as he 
can catch in the blast. He then moves to land on the 
ledge behind the PCs, if possible.
Round 3+: Infernus makes a bite attack against 
the closest PC he can reach and spends an action 
point to use double attack against another character. 
Finally, he uses his tail strike to strike any annoying 
flankers.
 
If Infernus becomes bloodied and uses his bloodied 
breath, he considers flying out of the volcano if he’s 
faring poorly against the PCs. Otherwise, he attempts 
to bull rush enemies into the magma to eliminate 
troublesome PCs who have managed to escape the 
worst of his attacks.
Development
Although Infernus is content to fight the PCs in his 
lair, his battles against the tieflings of Bael Turath 
taught him the value of retreat. He readily flees the 
volcano if the PCs manage to survive 4 rounds of 
fighting, flying over their heads and up through the 
cone. After he is out, Infernus circles around the 
volcano to look for signs of how the party reached 
his island. While the PCs follow him or tend to their 
injuries, the dragon attacks any allies who remained 
above or rips apart any vehicles the characters left 
behind.
 
When Infernus sees the PCs emerge from the 
volcano, he engages them again if his breath weapon
has recharged. This time, he uses immolate foe to hit 
artillery characters who had success against him in 
his lair. Afterward, Infernus flies back into his lair to 
recharge his breath weapon.
Features of the Area
Illumination: Dim light from the volcano’s fiery 
magma.
Boiling Water: A pool of boiling water covers the 
floor near the back of the chamber. Characters start-
ing their turns adjacent to the boiling water take 5 
fire damage, and those entering a square of boiling 
water take 20 fire damage.
Bones: Infernus keeps a big pile of the bones of 
the azers and whales he’s eaten. Beneath the mess lies 
his hoard. Mindful of the heat, Infernus keeps only 
items that can survive the furnacelike environment. 
His hoard includes 87 pp, 8,261 gp, 5,993 sp, and 
44,070 cp, all half melted into large chunks; a plati-
num bar (5,000 gp); a pillar of blended narwhal ivory 
scorched black by the heat (7,500 gp); a steel Arkho-
sian medal awarded to Infernus for courage (2,500 
gp); three fire opals (1,000 gp each); three diamonds 
(5,000 gp each); and a level 21 magic item.
 
A square containing bones is difficult terrain.
 
Heat: It’s extremely hot on the dragon’s ledge. At 
the end of each character’s turn spent here, that char-
acter must make a saving throw or lose one healing 
surge. Inside the caldera, the heat from the volcano 
deals 5 fire damage to a character for each round he 
or she spends in the area.
 
Magma: Beyond the ledge lies the heart of the vol-
cano, a pool of churning magma about 70 feet below. 
Characters who fall into the magma take falling 
damage and other damage as described under area 2 
on page 136.
 
Uneven Floor: The floor is uneven and drops 5 
feet, climbs 5 feet, and drops 10 feet as indicated on 
the tactical map. A character can hop down 5 feet 
without slowing down, but it costs 1 extra square of 
movement to scramble up 5 feet, and an Athletics 
check is required to climb or jump down 10 feet .
Conclusion
Infernus continues leading the PCs into and out of 
his lair, wearing them down all the while, until the 
characters manage to corner him or he finally wipes 
them out.

C H A P T E R  3  |  D ra g o n  L a i r s
A lair for five 27th-level adventurers
Urum-Shar is one of the most infamous members 
of the surviving bloodline of Nefermandias the For-
saken Pharaoh (see page 240). The ancient brown 
dragon is said to possess an emperor’s ransom in trea-
sures and ancient lore—and to have surrounded the 
hoard with an array of traps and fiendish devices to 
make even epic adventurers think twice.
History
Unlike her father, who ruled Maru-Qet with ambition 
and religious zealotry, Urum-Shar and her siblings 
sought only the luxuries that came with power. Tradi-
tion dictated that each draconic ruler dwell in her 
own tomb so that she would have the same comforts 
in life and in death, and Urum-Shar spent uncounted 
gold—and the lives of whole villages of slaves—in the 
construction of her abode.
 
When Maru-Qet fell in Nefermandias’s war with 
the catastrophic dragons, his youngest daughter was 
one of the few who survived. Today, she sulks in her 
tomb, venturing out on occasion to steal treasures, 
slaves, and taste sensations from the desert’s nomadic 
tribes, and even from various communities beyond 
Maru-Qet’s borders. Urum-Shar is a fallen demigod, 
but she refuses to lie quietly.
Environment
Maru-Qet is a burning desert, swept by vicious 
sandstorms and savaged by horrific extremes of tem-
perature. By day, the heat is stifling, baking the life 
from all but the hardiest of travelers. The cold at night 
is less severe but still biting enough to hinder and 
harm. To withstand the temperatures, the PCs must 
make DC 26 Endurance checks by day and DC 22 
Endurance checks by night (see “Environmental Dan-
gers,” Dungeon Master’s Guide, page 158).
 
Stone ruins of the old empire protrude from the 
desert’s sands. Most are empty shells, the bones of 
Maru-Qet’s dead skeleton, but some serve as shelter 
for the region’s nomadic tribes or as homes to far 
more monstrous inhabitants.
 
The tomb is protected by a variant of the Forbid-
dance ritual. No teleportation effects can carry 
someone into or out of any level of the tomb (with the 
exception of area 9). Inside the tomb, short-range tele-
portation within line of sight functions normally, but 
teleportation beyond line of sight fails, even a simple 
trip from one side of a wall to the other.
Approaching the Tomb
When the PCs enter the hole or tunnel that 
leads to the tomb, read:
The passage seems to fall away into infinity as you descend. 
The walls are of rough rock, chipped and sharp, as though 
someone broke away a portion of the earth through brute 
force.
 
Even stranger, however, is the sound. The great pit 
subtly vibrates, and the air is filled with a dull, grinding 
rush. It’s as if a great torrent of water were flowing through 
pipes and passages in the surrounding earth.
When the PCs reach the end of the hole, read:
The passage opens up into a square chamber—though 
perhaps “cavern” might be a more apt description, given its 
enormous size.
 
The strange reverberations you heard now have an obvi-
ous cause. A few yards north of you, a second hole in the 
ceiling releases a torrent of sand, a waterfall of grit pouring 
into the center of the chamber. There it sprays over the top 
of a massive ziggurat of black stone, a basalt monstrosity 
that dominates the cavern.
In areas 1 through 4, the sound of rushing sand 
imposes a –5 penalty to Perception checks to detect 
anything more than 1 square distant.
Area 1: The Crown
If nothing else, this great underground ziggurat 
serves as evidence of Urum-Shar’s twisted sense of 
grandeur.
If the PCs reach the top of the ziggurat, read:
To the south descends an impossibly steep staircase. On the 
other three sides, steep channels cut into the ziggurat direct 
the falling sand into veritable rivers that flow out into the 
cavern. The sand has accumulated alongside those chan-
nels and on the ziggurat’s various ledges.
THE TOMB OF URUM-SHAR
THE TOMB OF URUM-SHAR
A LARGER TOMB
As written, this lair is not an adventure location on its 
own. It represents the innermost sanctum of a larger 
complex, reached only after the PCs have survived a host 
of other death traps, guardians, and curses. Regardless of 
how you use the tomb, the lair is set underground, acces-
sible only through a deep hole or tunnel. The PCs must 
descend by using the existing ladder, their own ropes, 
or—perhaps more likely at this level—magic.

THE TOMB OF URUM-SHAR
Perception Check
DC 37: A thin seam runs along the edge of the platform 
that serves as the ziggurat’s highest point.
Features of the Area
Falling Sand: Anyone standing in the cascade is 
subject to the following attack every round: +29 vs. 
Fortitude; on a hit a character is knocked prone and 
immobilized (save ends, must save before standing 
from prone); a prone character in the cascade is sub-
ject to suffocation (Dungeon Master’s Guide, page 159). 
The area is difficult terrain.
Ledges: Each ledge of the ziggurat is 10 feet 
above the next. Climbing from one ledge to the next 
requires a DC 20 Athletics check.
Sand Patches: These squares are difficult terrain.
Secret Door: The entirety of area 1 is a secret 
door that opens upward at an angle to prevent the 
falling sand from entering. This leads to another ver-
tical passage that descends to area 7.
Area 2: Sand Sluice
Three conduits channel the bulk of the sand to and 
through grates that lie beneath bas-reliefs on the 
walls.
If the PCs examine the channels, read:
The sand rushes down these spillways in raging torrents. 
The channels continue along the floor beyond the ziggurat, 
carrying the sand toward strange brass figures on the cav-
ern’s far walls.
Features of the Area
Falling Sand: Anyone caught in a channel is 
subject to the following attack every round: +29 vs. 
Fortitude; on a hit a character is knocked prone and 
immobilized (save ends, must save before stand-
ing from prone), and slid 4 squares down the slope 
toward the bas-reliefs marked “a,” “b,” or “d.” A prone 
character in the rushing sand is subject to suffocation 
(Dungeon Master’s Guide, page 159). A character who 
reaches a bas-relief no longer slides but takes a –2 
penalty to the saving throw to end the immobilized 
condition. The area is difficult terrain.
Area 3: The Plains of Stone
The great cavern contains more than just the 
ziggurat.
When the PCs examine the room, read:
The floor is made of reflective black stone that is as dark 
as obsidian and as hard as granite. No seams are visible 
between the floor and the stone ziggurat.
Features of the Area
 
Bas-Reliefs: In the center of each wall stands 
an exquisite 20-foot bas-relief carving of a dragon 
(marked on the map as “a,” “b,” “c,” and “d”). Beneath 
each carving sits a large bronze grate through which 
the flowing sand disappears. Where it goes, only 
Urum-Shar or the gods can say.
 
Sand Patches: These squares are difficult terrain.
 
Statues: The statues (marked on the map as “e”) 
are of dragon-headed humanoids with halberds. 
They stand 60 feet tall and require a DC 20 Athletics 
check to climb. The fallen statue (marked “f”) is 15 
feet high.
Area 4: Descent
These stairs lead not to the dragon’s lair but to a 
gauntlet of death traps.
When the PCs look or begin down the stairs, 
read:
These steep steps lead down not merely to the floor, but 
through it, eventually ending at a set of massive double 
doors.
Each stair is 1 foot deep and 1 foot high. From this 
side, the double doors can be opened without a check.
Area 5: The Murderous Depths 
(Level 27)
These stairs, and the chamber beyond, are nearly as 
deadly as Urum-Shar.
When the PCs enter the stairwell on the other 
side of the double doors, read:
The stairs descend into a seemingly infinite darkness. On 
either side, statues glare down at you like angry deities. 
Some are dragons, coiled around great stone pillars, and 
others resemble the dragon-headed humanoids you saw 
in the chamber upstairs. You can see nothing but darkness 
beyond the statues.
When the PCs can see the area at the bottom of 
the stairs, read:
At the base of the stairs, an array of pillars surrounds a 
dusty shrine. Staring from within the altar are half a dozen 
draconic skulls, crudely mortared into place.
The tactical encounter begins when the PCs trigger 
any of the traps.
 
Tactical Encounter: “Stairway to Hell,” page 146.
 
The statues along the stairs sit on featureless 
pillars that rise from the floor to the level of the stair-
case, forming pedestals.

Urum-Shar occasionally comes here to visit the 
shrine of skulls that she made from her slain enemies. 
Mostly, however, this chamber is meant to kill. Even 
her servants do not know that her lair isn’t hidden 
here. As far as the dragon is concerned, any servant 
who attempts to visit her without prior permission 
deserves death.
Area 6: An Empty Darkness
This area is the vast, darkened chamber beyond the 
stairs and the shrine, not fully shown on the map.
When the PCs explore the surrounding dark-
ness, read:
Old bones lie scattered about, apparently those of prior 
explorers. Other than these and the bases of the massive 
statues, the darkened chamber appears to be empty.
This chamber isn’t entirely a waste of the PCs’ time. 
Urum-Shar is meticulous about gathering all valu-
ables from those who fall victim to her traps, but she 
has missed something.
Treasure: If the PCs make a DC 30 Perception 
check, they find that one of the broken skeletons 
wears +6 delver’s scale armor.
Area 7: Inner Sanctum (Level 27)
The secret door in area 1 leads to a hole in the earth 
that is 20 feet wide and 60 feet deep. Unlike the 
entrance to the tomb level, this hole lacks a ladder.
When the PCs look through the hole, read:
Another large chamber waits below. Its floor seems to 
consist of tightly packed sand, though numerous rocky 
protrusions create a vast array of ledges at random heights 
around the room.
When the PCs can see the whole chamber, read:
On the south wall, a semicircular ledge—one of the few 
features that seems carved, rather than natural—overlooks 
a platform at the bottom of a short flight of stairs. The plat-
form stands over a dark pit. At the rear of the ledge is a pair 
of heavy stone doors.
Urum-Shar uses the platform as an audience cham-
ber. She sits on her ledge and glares down at visitors 
on the platform. Those who displease her are shoved 
off the edge to feed the dread wraith in area 8.
When the first PC enters the room, read:
You start briefly as a great winged beast, draconic but two-
legged, looms from the shadows on the ceiling. It takes you 
a second to realize that the hanging monstrosity is merely a 
sculpture, not a living being.
The sculpture, of an earthen wyvern, is one of the 
chamber’s traps. The tactical encounter begins as 
soon as a PC enters the room.
 
Tactical Encounter: “Beneath the Sands,” page 
148.
 
After Urum-Shar is dead, the PCs can investigate 
her sanctum, acquire the treasure, and earn the eter-
nal enmity of her surviving relatives—including the 
dreaded Nefermandias.
Area 8: The Pit
The pit is 40 feet deep. The dread wraith in the pit is 
mystically bound to this location and cannot leave.
When the PCs approach the pit, read:
A strange chill taints the air of this deep, dark pit, as though 
something unholy died within.
The dread wraith attacks the instant anyone enters 
the pit.
 
Tactical Encounter: “Beneath the Sands,” page 
148.
Area 9: A Bed of Platinum
Though the PCs might not realize it, this corridor 
stands inside the structure that supports the stairs in 
area 5.
When the PCs enter this chamber, read:
Coins litter the floor, and various works of art stand dis-
played haphazardly against the walls. On the far wall is a 
10-foot-diameter circle of runes, apparently carved directly 
into the rock by massive claws.
A DC 20 Arcana check reveals that the circle is the 
one end of a set of teleportation portals; this chamber 
is the only place in the tomb where such magic func-
tions. An identical circle is carved in a rock hidden in 
a small desert cave over a mile away. Urum-Shar uses 
teleportation to enter and leave her lair.
 
Treasure: Urum-Shar’s hoard includes a +6 staff 
of power, a dragondaunt shield (epic tier), 23 ad, 900 pp, 
a ruby mined from the Elemental Chaos and carved 
into a perfect replica of a dragon’s eye (57,000 gp), the 
mithral wedding band of the ancient eladrin Queen 
Amathiel (43,000 gp), and 50,000 gp worth of ritu-
als (include at least one dragon-specific ritual from 
Chapter 2 of this book). These items, combined with 
the treasure in area 6, are meant to serve as half of 
the treasure found at 25th level.

when the first trap has activated, adding additional 
traps as they activate.
When the breathing door first attacks, read:
A howling gust of burning sand rushes downward, flaying 
everything in its path.
When the dragon blades first attack, read:
The neck of the great dragon statue bends, aiming its fear-
some head straight at you.
When the hellish halberd first attacks, read:
The dragon-headed god rotates, bringing its great halberd 
down and around in a sweeping arc.
When the claws of sand first attack, read:
A great draconic claw, covered in sand and flickering fire, 
rises up and makes a sudden grab.
When the jaws of death first attack, read:
A stream of dark mist splits swiftly into multiple translu-
cent serpents with gaping draconic jaws.
Breathing Door 
Level 25 Elite Blaster
Trap 
XP 14,000

and then it breathes at regular intervals and when a creature 
tries to sneak past its frame. 
Perception
✦ DC 37: The character notices the runes carefully inscribed 
around the door frame.

THE TOMB OF URUM-SHAR
Hellish Halberd 
Level 25 Elite Obstacle
Trap 
XP 14,000
The great dragon-headed humanoid statue clutches a halberd. It 
seems capable of clearing a wide swath with a single swing.
Trap: When the PCs pass the statue, it swings its halberd, then 
continues to attack each round and when someone tries to pass 
by the statue.
Perception
✦ DC 31: The character notices that portions of the statue are 
hinged for movement.
✦ DC 35: The character spots the hidden control panel in the 
statue’s abdomen.
Trigger
When the PCs have moved 1 square lower than the statue on 
the stairs, it attacks as an immediate reaction. It then enters 
the initiative order directly after the creature that triggered it,

each round as an immediate reaction, triggered when someone 
attempts to move past the trigger square heading upward.
Attack
Immediate Reaction or Standard Action Melee reach 6

Claws of Sand 
Level 25 Lurker
Trap

those around them.
Trap: When the PCs venture too close, claws of sand reach out to 
attack them.
Perception
✦ DC 28: The character notices something odd about the patterns 
of sand on the ﬂ oor.
Initiative +6
Trigger
 
When a character comes within 8 squares of the focus point 
marked “C” on the shrine, the trap rolls initiative.

Standard Action 
Ranged 10
Target: One creature in range
Attack: +28 vs. Reﬂ ex
Hit: 6d8 + 9 damage, and the target takes ongoing 10 damage and 
is immobilized (save ends both).
Miss: Half damage, no ongoing damage, and the target is slowed 
(not immobilized) until the end of the trap’s next turn.
Countermeasures
✦ A creature adjacent to the shrine can attempt to disable the 
trap (Thievery DC 30).
✦ A character can attack the focus point on the shrine (AC/Reﬂ ex 
4, Fortitude 10, hit points 135). Destroying the focus point 
deactivates the trap.
Jaws of Death 
Level 25 Elite Lurker
Trap 
XP 14,000
Wispy, wraithlike serpents with draconic heads lash out, biting 
bodies and souls.
Trap: The jaws of death’s activation is contingent on the activation 
of other traps in the room. When one of those traps is triggered, 
so is this one.
Perception
✦ DC 28: The character notices runes carved into the skulls that 
make up the shrine.
Initiative +6
Trigger
 
When any other trap in the room is triggered, this trap rolls 
initiative.
Attack
Standard Action 
Ranged sight

Attack: +29 vs. Fortitude
Hit: 4d12 + 6 necrotic damage, and the target slides 6 squares.
Miss: Half damage, and the target slides 2 squares.
Countermeasures
✦ A character can attack the skulls in the shrine (AC/Reﬂ ex 4, 
Fortitude 10, hit points 165). Destroying the skulls deactivates 
the trap.
✦ Any radiant damage dealt to the skulls delays the trap for 1 
round (in addition to dealing damage).
Tactics
The traps activate and attack as described. The jaws 
of death use their slide ability to yank PCs off stairs or 
statues, to send them tumbling down the steps, or to 
move a target into range of other traps.
Features of the Area
Illumination: None.
Door: This heavy stone door slams and locks 
behind the PCs when they enter this area. It requires 
a DC 32 Strength check to batter open or a DC 37 
Thievery check to unlock. This is the only way out of 
this chamber.
Pillars: Each 40-foot-tall pillar fills a square and 
provides cover. Climbing a pillar requires a DC 33 
Athletics check. The pillars marked “b” are broken 
off at a height of roughly 20 feet.
Rubble: These squares are difficult terrain.
Shrine: A character can step up onto the shrine at 
the cost of 1 extra square of movement.
Steep Stairs: The stairs are difficult terrain. A 
character subjected to a push, pull, or slide effect that 
moves him down the stairs must make a DC 33 Acro-
batics check or tumble an additional 5 squares (or to 
the base), taking 1d6 damage and falling prone.
Statues: Climbing a statue or clinging to one after 
leaping from the steps requires a DC 29 Athletics 
check. The statue marked “a” is broken off about 5 
feet higher than the neighboring stairs.

Tactics
Round 1: Urum-Shar uses her frightful presence. If 
she stuns at least half the party, she spends an action 
point to attack the remainder. If she does not stun 
half the group, she transforms into sand to attack the 
PCs.
Round 2+: Urum-Shar uses her abilities as appro-
priate for the circumstances, but she rarely remains 
in one place for more than 1 round. If one or two 
PCs are away from the others—perhaps forced to 
move away by the jaws of death—she focuses on them. 
Urum-Shar fights to the death.

Pit (area 8): The pit is not really a trap because it 
is blatantly obvious, though its inhabitant is not. The 
pit is 40 feet deep. Climbing its walls requires a DC

RICK SARDINHA
A lair for five 28th-level adventurers
In one of the countless layers of the Abyss yawns the 
great Blood Sea, a region of ichor and clotted fluid 
that churns and writhes, flowing everywhere and 
nowhere at once. The Blood Sea touches all great 
waters found in the Abyss and snatches errant trav-
elers and foul fiends, subjecting them to the filthy 
denizens of its depths and the exiled demon lords left 
to rot on islands of flesh and congealed blood.
 
Although the strange and disturbing vistas of the 
Blood Sea are endless, few compare to the floating 
islands of rotting flesh that drift across the leprous 
sky, raining pus and blood. It is fitting, then, that 
the flesh clouds are home to a ravenous deathmask 
dragon, a beast whose hunger rivals that of the dread 
goristro demons and whose savagery is eclipsed only 
by the vicious cruelty of the balors.
History
No one is certain where the fleshy islands came from; 
demons have little concern or care for the history of 
their diseased realm. Cosmologists have postulated 
that the flesh might be the remains of the Blood Lord 
Haemnathuun, suggesting that blood fiends who 
joined the primordial in his ancient war against the 
deities retrieved sections of their master’s corpse in 
the hope of recreating him. To escape the astral stalk-
ers, they fled to the Abyss.
 
Other theories suggest that the flesh is from a dead 
deity, one cast out from the Astral Sea for madness 
and rent asunder by the ambitious demon lords in 
their bid to steal divine power for themselves. Con-
flicting arguments point to any number of deities, 
and no evidence has been found to identify any one 
particular god with certainty.
 
The true origin of these floating patches of flesh 
is unknown, but few can deny the identity of the 
islands’ most infamous inhabitant—Anthraxin the 
Devourer. The dragon came to the islands centuries 
before, and she carved out a kingdom of sorts amid 
the fleshy mounds and suppurating sores. Establish-
ing herself as mistress of the floating flesh, Anthraxin 
commanded a region devoid of subjects, aside from a 
scattering of blood fiends that burrowed in the moist 
crevices of the rancid meat. That she had no subjects 
meant little to the deathmask dragon. Instead, she 
embraced the disgusting feast before her and gorged 
herself on the choicest morsels harvested from the 
dripping viscera.
 
For centuries, Anthraxin ruled uncontested, and 
in time, even the blood fiends paid her respect, 
bowing and scraping before her bloated magnifi-
cence. But recently, her territory has been invaded by 
new powers—wretched demons from the deep that 
neither care nor worry about the dragon’s presence. 
They ignore her and focus on plundering the islands, 
tearing through the soft meat in search of something 
for their distant master.
 
Anthraxin is concerned about the demons’ pres-
ence because their work weakens the islands, and 
when they exhaust one, ripping apart its guts, it loses 
buoyancy and slowly sinks to the Blood Sea below. 
Fearing that the demons will destroy her entire 
realm, Anthraxin wants to gain their attention and, 
she hopes, their adulation. If she can bend them to 
her will, she can learn what they seek and perhaps 
claim it for herself.
Environment
Each island is a microcosm of the Abyss’s disturbing 
capacity for randomness and its disdain for life. The 
isles are perversions, gross and twisted parodies of 
the land masses found in the mortal world. Instead 
of woods, one finds forests of hair. In place of glisten-
ing pools of clean water are leprous bogs choked with 
squirming parasites and crawling with vermin. Life

ABYSSAL LAIR
exists on the islands, but only in disgusting and despi-
cable forms.
 
Most islands are 7 squares thick at the center. 
Each is an expanse of fleshy material, and the ground 
has the consistency of flesh. In fact, if it is burned, 
pus-filled blisters form; if the ground is cut, it bleeds 
and scabs over in time. The islands do not respond 
physically to violence or pain, and the appearance of 
fluids suggests an innate defense system to protect 
their integrity.
 
The islands float 50 to 70 feet above the Blood Sea. 
They are naturally buoyant and can bear any weight 
without losing altitude. The only way to bring down 
an island is to kill it by dealing extensive damage to 
whatever lies beneath the skin.
 
A few islands sport bizarre organs that resemble 
red eyes. When a creature comes within 5 squares 
of an eye, it flutters open and watches the intruder. 
Blood wells up from a dozen tear ducts, spills down, 
and gathers in puddles. The pupil follows the move-
ments of any creature that comes close, but the eye 
shuts as soon as all creatures move more than 5 
squares away from it. An eye has AC 3 and 30 hit 
points. If reduced to 0 hit points, it spews a torrent of 
blood that makes the ground slippery in a radius of 
5 squares. Such spaces are both difficult terrain and 
challenging terrain (Acrobatics DC 15).
 
Beneath the islands churns the Blood Sea. The 
fluid is actually blood and counts as rough water for 
the purpose of making Athletics checks to swim or 
tread water.
Approaching the Lair
When the PCs approach the area, read:
Drifting beneath a pestilential firmament are six fleshy 
clouds, islands in the sky. They quiver as they move, trailing 
curtains of filth as they travel across the diseased heavens.
Area 1: The Weeping Wound
Floating 60 feet above the Blood Sea, this island 
jockeys with the Island of Pustules (area 2) for the 
lead position, but it frequently loses ground because it 
hemorrhages blood from a dreadful wound. Flaps of 
skin hang like a skirt beneath the central mound.
When the PCs land on this island, read:
A profound stink rises from this island of flesh, emanating 
from a ring of putrid skin that sloughs chunks of decayed 
meat. Pouring from a grievous wound is a river of blood 
that spills off the edges, raining down on the crimson sea 
below.
Area 2: Island of Pustules
This island is “healthy” except for the tumescent pus-
tules that dot its surface. It floats 70 feet above the sea.
When the PCs land on this island, read:
The ground here is firm and leathery, almost as if callused. 
Rubbery mounds scattered across the ground are filled with 
green fluid.
The pustules are harmless until they are touched.
Tumescent Pustule 
Level 15 Blaster
Hazard 
XP 1,200
A shuddering pustule bursts in an explosion of acidic slime.
Hazard: When creatures touch these pustules, they explode in a 
burst of acid.
Perception
No check is necessary to notice the pustules.
Additional Skill: Nature
✦ DC 25: The character recognizes the danger of the pustules 
before they erupt.
Trigger
 
A pustule explodes when touched.
Attack
Opportunity Action Close burst 4
Target: Each creature in burst
Attack: +17 vs. Reﬂ ex
Hit: 4d8 + 7 acid damage, and the target takes ongoing 5 acid 
damage and is weakened (save ends both).
Miss: Half damage.
Countermeasures
✦ A character in the burst can minimize the damage of a pustule 
with a DC 23 Nature check made as an immediate interrupt 
before the pustule’s attack. On a success, the character gains 
a +2 bonus to Reﬂ ex on the attack, and takes no damage if the 
attack misses.
Area 3: Rotten Island
Another damaged island, this one began its slow 
decline after being struck by a falling object—
Rroglatha, a former marilith servant of Graz’zt who 
displeased her master and was thrown down to the 
Sea of Blood. Instead of hitting the sea, Rroglatha 
struck this island and punched through the flesh to 
become embedded inside. The demon was killed on 
impact, and her trapped carcass still festers, infecting 
the island and causing it to rot from the inside out.
When the PCs land on this island, read:
The stench of decay here is overwhelming and seems stron-
gest from a jagged hole that bores into the island. Vile pus 
wells up from the hole, green from infection. On the oppo-
site side of the island, more fluid spills off the edge to fall on 
a lower plateau, where it gathers in a stinking pool.
The Rotten Island holds a few places of interest.
Infected Wound: The infected wound marks 
the place where the demon fell. The area around the 
wound is slick with corruption, and the hole descends 
10 feet to a puddle of the noxious stuff. Characters 
exposed to the fluid are automatically slowed and 
weakened (save ends both).

152
C H A P T E R  3  |  D ra g o n  L a i r s
JASON A. ENGLE
Gangrenous Pond: As the infection in the island 
worsens, it oozes fluids from a small cavelike open-
ing that drains the corruption and slows its inevitable 
march toward destruction. The runoff flows over the 
edge of the island, gathering in a disgusting pool on 
a lower ledge, where bright green parasites swallow 
it and burrow into the soft flesh. These creatures are 
harmless, but the pond is not. A character touching 
the pond or the runoff above takes 10 acid damage. 
Characters immersed in the fluid take 50 acid 
damage and ongoing 20 acid damage (save ends).
Area 4: Clots
It should come as no surprise that portions of the 
Sea of Blood occasionally congeal into clots. The 
entire sea isn’t covered by a vast skin of dried blood 
because creatures from the depths harvest the dried 
material, breaking off chunks to bring back to their 
sunken citadels and devour at their leisure. Although 
the indigenous creatures of the Blood Sea hinder the 
growth of clots, mounds of brittle material can be 
found throughout the sea and are rarely unoccupied.
When the PCs land on a clot, read:
This strange formation is tough and leathery, with crests 
and waves across its entire area. It moves across the dark 
sea with ease and shifts beneath your weight.
The clots hold nothing of interest. If you’d like to 
inject a bit more danger into this environment, con-
sider populating a clot with the following optional 
encounter.
Optional: Stranded
Level 23 Encounter (XP 25,500)
✦ 5 blood fiends (level 23 soldier)
A band of blood fiends fell from one of the floating 
islands, dislodged by the demonic miners. They now 
congregate on a blood clot, cursing their enemies far 
above, but they are too afraid of the demons to seek 
revenge.
Area 5: Isle of Faces (Level 28)
This island, whose surface resembles a patchwork of 
faces, houses Anthraxin and her blood fiend cronies. 
From the quivering hills, she watches her foes on the 
demon mines (area 7) with interest. She makes no 
effort to hide her presence.
 
Characters trigger the tactical encounter by land-
ing on the island.
Tactical Encounter: “Isle of Faces,” page 154.
Area 6: Hair Forest
This island floats 50 feet above the Blood Sea, just 
below the Isle of Faces.
When the PCs land on this island, read:
Towering brown and black trees covered in scales and barbs 
curl up from the spongy ground.
In truth, the trees are massive hairs, each about 3 feet 
in diameter and up to 20 feet tall. Climbing a hair 
requires a DC 15 Athletics check, but a hair bends 
to the ground when it is burdened by more than 300 
pounds of weight.
Area 7: Demon Mines (Level 25)
On this island, a balor leads a company of demons 
in search of the fallen servant of Graz’zt. They serve 
Pazuzu, demon lord of the winds and father of 
droughts and famine, and they seek to wring Graz’zt’s 
secrets out of the marilith—if she still lives. Heedless 
of the fact that their excavations kill the islands, the 
demons continue to tear apart every bit of flesh and 
slaughter anything that gets in their way.
 
Landing on this island triggers the tactical 
encounter.
Tactical Encounter: “Demon Miners,” page 156.
Area 8: Buboes
Not all the islands are large masses; floating amid 
the rest are numerous tiny bits of flesh called buboes. 
Crawling with vermin and favored by demonic car-
rion birds, buboes rarely last long. However, they 
respond to the presence of life. Any living creature 
that lands on a bubo can exert its influence over the 
island by making a DC 30 Charisma check. A success 
allows the creature to direct the bubo, maneuvering 
the small island wherever it wishes. Each bubo has 
a fly speed of 8. If a bubo is flown more than 1 mile 
from the rest of the islands, it decays rapidly, deposit-
ing its riders into the Blood Sea.
Area 9: Sinking Island
Demonic mining killed this island, and now it slowly 
sinks toward the Blood Sea below. It currently hovers 
30 feet above the crimson surface.
When the PCs land on this island, read:
The ground here is soft and gives under your weight. It sags 
in places, and the cavities fill with brown fluid that reeks of 
decay. You get the distinct impression that this island is no 
longer alive.

Encounter Level 28 (71,800 XP), add:
4 gray wing vrocks (see page 157)
Anthraxin sits in the open, confident that her 
malevolent presence will deter other creatures from 
threatening her. Although her attention is fixed on 
area 7, she is mindful of other creatures that come 
close. Place her miniature where indicated on the 
tactical map.
 
The blood fiends prowl around the island, wail-
ing about the destruction of their floating homes. 
Enraged by the demons, they would attack the miners 
in area 7 if not for the fact that Anthraxin forbids it, at 
least for now. Place the blood fiends where indicated 
on the tactical map.
 
The players should place their miniatures on the 
edge of the map on a side appropriate to the direction 
they came from.
When the PCs land on the island, read:
Positioned between three smooth hills is a great draconic 
horror, a vile cross of dragon and demon. Scores of legs 
emerge from the sides of its serpentine body. From between 
its scales, twisted, leering faces mouth silent curses. The 
dragon’s head is wide and toadlike, and a smear of red 
across its lips suggests that it is unusually vain—or hungry.
 
Gathered around the beast are four powerfully built 
humanoids. They have gleaming eyes the color of the sea 
below and wide maws filled with crooked fangs. Two sets of 
claws flex in eagerness for the coming attack.
Perception Check
DC 15: The ground here resembles the dragon in that it is 
a mass of facial features—noses, mouths, and blinking eyes. 
In some cases, they are arranged enough to look like faces.
DC 20: The dragon seems preoccupied, frequently cast-
ing its gaze at a distant island, where you see enormous 
demons ripping through the flesh and spraying fountains 
of blood as they work.

Tactics
An attack shocks Anthraxin, but she quickly recovers 
and viciously responds in kind.
Round 1: The dragon’s first action is to catch the 
adventurers in the area of her wail of death; then she 
uses mask of dread against an enemy outside that area. 
Finally, she moves forward and uses frightful presence 
to stun her enemies.
 
The blood fiends take to the air, each flying toward 
a different enemy. When one comes within 3 squares 
of a PC, it uses terror gaze to immobilize that enemy 
and try to push him into the sea below.
Round 2: Anthraxin phases through the island, 
emerges beneath it, and flies back up toward the 
PCs, hoping to take them from behind. After she is in 
position, she spends an action point to use her breath 
weapon and takes a minor action to use mask of dread 
against an enemy.
 
The blood fiends continue to use terror gaze until 
an enemy lands on the island. At that point, they drop 
back to the ground to attack with their claws.
 
Round 3+: Anthraxin closes with any PCs on the 
ground and presses them with bites and claws until 
her powers recharge. Whenever possible, she backs 
off and uses a power instead of staying in melee.
 
The blood fiends fight until the PCs are bloodied 
and then go wild with their bloodthirsty bite.
Development
Combat might draw the attention of the balor in area 
7. If the battle continues for 4 or more rounds, the 
balor dispatches the gray wing vrocks to investigate 
and bring the fight to a close so that the demons can 
work without being disturbed.
Features of the Area
Illumination: A dim red light suffuses the 
area.
Faces: Faces peer up from the island’s 
surface, potentially obstructing movement 
because of their gaping mouths. Any crea-
ture that did not move on its previous turn 
becomes slowed until the end of its turn.
 Orifice: A pair of moist openings lead into 
the dark recesses of the island. They are too 
small to enter, but they spew noxious gas. 
Creatures that start their turns adjacent to 
an orifice become weakened until the end of 
their next turn. Tucked into one of the orifices 
(your choice) is the dragon’s hoard. It consists 
of a small golden coffer (500 gp) contain-
ing 12 ad and 3,145 pp; a sack with five star 
sapphires (5,000 gp each); an amulet of cold-
forged elemental fire bearing a soul fragment 
of one of the first archons (50,000 gp); an ada-
mantine broach set with an astral diamond 
(50,000 gp); a brilliant rug woven from celestial gold 
that depicts images of suns and stars on a field of 
white (50,000 gp); a tiny, nonfunctional mechani-
cal bird constructed of adamantine and platinum 
(15,000 gp); a level 27 magic item; and a level 29 
magic item.
 
Soft Edges: The island’s edges are thin and inca-
pable of supporting weight. Any creature that enters a 
square containing an edge must succeed on a DC 10 
Acrobatics check or slip off the edge and fall into the 
Blood Sea 70 feet below, taking 7d10 falling damage 
on impact.
 
Weeping Eye: This bizarre organ resembles a red 
eye. When a creature comes within 5 squares of the 
eye, it flutters open and watches the intruder. Blood 
wells up from a dozen tear ducts, spills down, and 
gathers in puddles. The pupil follows the movements 
of any creature that comes close, but the eye shuts 
as soon as all creatures move more than 5 squares 
away from it. The eye has AC 3 and 30 hit points. If 
reduced to 0 hit points, it spews a torrent of blood that 
makes the ground slippery in a radius of 5 squares. 
Such spaces are both difficult terrain and challenging 
terrain (Acrobatics DC 15).
Conclusion
The blood fiends fight until destroyed. Anthraxin 
is no fool, however, and might fly to another island 
to lure the PCs to dangerous terrain. She favors the 
Island of Pustules (area 2), but if reduced to one-
quarter or fewer of her hit points, she leads the PCs 
to area 7 to force the demons into the fight.

The balor watches two goristro demons rip open 
the island’s flesh to search for the fallen marilith. 
Meanwhile, four gray wing vrocks circle around the 
island to protect the excavation. Place all the demons 
where indicated on the tactical map. (If the PCs have 
already dealt with Anthraxin, they might have faced

Two massive, bull-headed demons tear through the soft 
flesh of the island with claws and teeth, sending sprays of

Tactics
Round 1+: Although the balor can fly, it doesn’t 
do so very well, so it fights from the ground. It uses 
fire and lightning to hit any enemies that it can reach, 
dragging its victims into the flames of its body.
 
The goristros use goring charge against any PCs on 
the ground, hoping to knock their foes off the island 
and into the sea. If a goristro has no viable enemies, it 
spends its entire turn ripping new holes in the island. 
Each hole takes up 1 entire square and functions as a 
flesh mine (see Features of the Area).
 
The vrocks are far more adept in the air and 
attempt to close with flying PCs. They attack using 
stunning screech and then use flyby attack to slash at 
flying foes and drive them to the island.
Development
If the PCs have not yet dealt with Anthraxin, the 
deathmask dragon sees the battle as an opportunity to 
take out the demons and the adventurers at the same 
time. She and her blood fiends leave their island and 
join the fight, arriving at the start of the third round.
 
The blood fiends drop from the air and attack the 
goristros with their claws, trying to stop the demons’ 
efforts to destroy the island. They use terror gaze at 
anyone who interferes. The blood fiends are most 
concerned with destroying the demons and regard 
the PCs as secondary targets only.
 
Anthraxin keeps to the air, using wail of death to 
haunt the PCs. She reserves her action points, breath 
weapon, and frightful presence for use in the event that 
she is attacked by three or more enemies at one time.
 
The demons are not selective about their foes. The 
goristros gladly engage the blood fiends. The vrocks 
split their attention between flying PCs and the 
dragon. The balor attends to PCs on the ground or 
attacks the blood fiends to preserve its miners.
Features of the Area
 
Illumination: A dim red light suffuses the area.
 
Flesh Mine: The goristros tear jagged holes in the 
island, causing fountains of blood to spew into the air. 
Any square adjacent to a flesh mine is lightly obscured.
 
Orifice: A moist opening leads into the dark 
recesses of the island. It is too small to enter, but it 
leaks noxious gas. Creatures that start their turns 
adjacent to the orifice become weakened until the 
end of their next turn.
 
Soft Edges: The island’s edges are thin and inca-
pable of supporting weight. Any creature that enters a 
square containing an edge must succeed on a DC 10 
Acrobatics check or slip off the edge and fall into the 
Blood Sea 70 feet below, taking 7d10 falling damage 
on impact.
 
Weeping Eye: This bizarre organ resembles a red 
eye. When a creature comes within 5 squares of the 
eye, it flutters open and watches the intruder. Blood 
wells up from a dozen tear ducts, spills down, and 
gathers in puddles. The pupil follows the movements 
of any creature that comes close, but the eye shuts 
as soon as all creatures move more than 5 squares 
away from it. The eye has AC 3 and 30 hit points. If 
reduced to 0 hit points, it spews a torrent of blood that 
makes the ground slippery in a radius of 5 squares. 
Such spaces are both difficult terrain and challenging 
terrain (Acrobatics DC 15).

A lair for five 29th-level adventurers
Hidden in dark corners of the world are grim temples 
to the deity Tiamat. Some are recent constructions, 
and others are ancient. A few share similar floor 
plans. However, Tiamat rarely visits any of these 
temples herself. In this regard, the Regnant Fane 
numbers among a handful of locations so blessed, for 
here, the god laid a clutch of eggs.
History
Some years past, a high priest of Tiamat named Azarr 
Kul created a magnificent temple to his divine bene-
factor. With her guidance, Kul dominated goblin, 
hobgoblin, and related monstrous humanoid tribes of 
the Wyrmsmoke Mountains. Kul, a dragon-favored 
hobgoblin, then turned his attention to the wider 
lands beyond the mountains. Unsuspecting human 
cities lay in the vale beyond, ripe for plunder to the 
greater glory of Tiamat’s celestial hoard (and her 
priesthood’s coffers).
 
But Azarr Kul’s ambitions were opposed by a val-
iant group of war veterans. They bearded the priest in 
the inner sanctum of his own temple, defeating him 
and the partly formed avatar of Tiamat that coalesced 
in Kul’s final hour. The allied armies that had formed 
under Tiamat’s banner melted away.
 
Surviving goblinoids that had served Azarr Kul 
declared the temple complex taboo and stayed clear 
ever after. The abandoned fane lay quiescent for over 
a year. However, divine energy released in the fane 
during the high priest’s final struggle remained. This 
fell energy reignited the divine portals that Kul had 
devised for communion with his deity.
 
Even in her priest’s absence, Tiamat turned her 
attention to the fane anew. She recalled the buried, 
abandoned temple already hallowed in her name and 
chose it as an ideal location for a nest—the perfect hide-
away for a clutch of her divine eggs. To further divert 
attention from the fane, she ripped away the original 
entrance one night, making it look as though a natural 
rockfall was to blame. Tiamat then arranged for new, 
stronger guardians in the fane and departed, confident 
that the temple would remain hidden. And if it did not, 
well, she would return to squelch any disturbance.
Environment
The Regnant Fane is concealed in the Wyrmsmoke 
Mountains, though few that remain in the area now 
recall it. The old pathway leading to the fane was col-
lapsed by the warriors who defeated Azarr Kul, and 
no direct physical method of reaching the temple 
remains. The entire complex is sealed in stone.
 
However, a less direct entrance exists. Those 
who desire to gain entry can find clues to locate the 
proper portal. (No clues are provided in the descrip-
tion of this lair; feel free to work them into your own 
adventures.)
Approaching the 
Regnant Fane
The planar portal that leads to the fane was ripped 
away from the world and hidden in a secure loca-
tion—a fiery isle lost in the infinity of the Elemental 
Chaos. However, epic-level characters who have the 
right clues can eventually find this entrance, which is 
the only way that anyone other than Tiamat can enter 
the fane.
When the PCs find the portal, read:
Amid the surging flames of the surrounding firestorm, 
a mote of stone resolves as a free-floating cliff face. The 
cliff face is carved to resemble a lifelike sculpture of a five-
headed dragon. The dragon is massive—easily 150 feet 
tall—and carved as if emerging from the stone. The five 
serpentine necks arch up and then back down, each leering 
a challenge at any who dare approach.
 
A huge pair of closed stone double doors are set into the 
dragon’s chest. Each door is 6 feet wide and 12 feet tall.
The entrance to the fane is trapped. The trap is 
triggered when anyone attempts to open the doors 
without observing proper obeisance (uttering the 
words, “Hail Tiamat, Devourer of Worlds and 
Granter of Vengeance,” in Draconic).
 
The entrance is not locked, but regardless of 
whether the intruder knows the words to bypass the 
trap, Tiamat is aware when the doors to the fane are 
opened. It is only a matter of time before she shows 
up to investigate the disturbance and deal with the 
trespassers.
REGNANT FANE
REGNANT FANE
WHY VISIT THE 
REGNANT FANE?
Possible reasons that a group of epic-level player charac-
ters might want to visit the fane include:
 
Dragon eggs laid by Tiamat are valuable beyond reck-
oning, and a clutch lies in the fane.
 
Tiamat is the ultimate villain in a long-running cam-
paign, and the PCs hope to draw her into battle here by 
attacking her eggs.
 
Talking to Tiamat is a crucial step in an even greater 
epic quest.

Five-Headed Trap 
Level 30 Blaster
Trap 
XP 19,000
The trap breathes five separate area breath attacks on all creatures 
within the area centered on the entrance.
Trap: Creatures that open the door without paying proper tribute 
to Tiamat are attacked by the ﬁ ve stone dragon heads that 
stand guard here.
Perception
✦ DC 30: A character notices magical trigger runes etched lightly 
around the area.
Trigger
When a creature attempts to open the doors without observing 
proper obeisance (uttering the words, “Hail Tiamat, Devourer 
of Worlds and Granter of Vengeance,” in Draconic), each of 
the ﬁ ve stone heads releases an attack that target all creatures 
within 50 feet of the entrance. The trap resets when the doors 
are closed. Anyone passing through in the opposite direction 
also triggers the attack, regardless of whether he makes proper 
obeisance.

Countermeasures
✦ A character who notices the runes and can read Draconic can 
infer the proper words to bypass the trap by making a DC 30 
Arcana check.
✦A creature adjacent to the trap can disable one head with a DC 
34 Thievery check.
Anyone who passes through the doors travels through 
several dimensions and reaches the Regnant Fane.
Area 1: Temple Entrance
Creatures that survived or bypassed the trap in area 
1 arrive here.
When the PCs pass through the portal, read:
You hurtle through a gap between nothing and everything. 
No air, no heat, nothing but nothing . . . until a blue parab-
ola snatches you back to reality. You fall several feet onto a 
litter of rotting wooden pews.
When the PCs look around area 1, read:
Disembodied points of light swirl and flow across the high 
ceiling, illuminating this chamber as if by candlelight.
 
Broken wooden pews fill the southern half of this temple. 
A flickering discontinuity in space hangs a few feet above 
the pews.
 
The northern portion of the temple is raised 5 feet and 
dominated by a stone altar that has been hewn in half. 
Three stone dragon heads rise up around the altar like the 
curling fingers of an upturned palm, and two other heads 
lie shattered and broken on the floor.
 
Five large alcoves 20 feet above the floor overlook the 
chamber.
At one time, this temple was active and saw periodic 
sacrifice to Tiamat. Now all is quiet, and its fell magic 
has been dispersed. The ancient exits to the south 
are destroyed, apparently having been collapsed by 
rockfalls. The only way out is back through the hole 
in space above the pews or forward through a large 
tunnel to the north.
Area 2: Guarded Cavern 
(Level 28)
Tiamat placed new, more potent guardians in this 
cavernous chamber to safeguard her eggs.
When the PCs look into area 2, read:
The air in the cavern is cemetery-cold and smells of rot. 
Thick carpets of pallid fungus grow around stalagmites, 
and razor-sharp stalactites descend from the ceiling. The 
cavern rises in three great steps toward the east, each tier 
rising roughly 10 feet above the previous. In the center of 
the chamber along the south wall is a massive, irregular pit 
of unknown depth filled with darkness.
Attempting to pass through the chamber triggers the 
tactical encounter.
 
Tactical Encounter: “Guarded Cavern,” page 
162.
Area 3: Outer Sanctum
This area was a place where clerics of Tiamat came to 
amplify their magic.

C H A P T E R  3  |  D ra g o n  L a i r s
JASON A. ENGLE
When the PCs look around area 3, read:
Five sinuous stone dragon heads curve up from the second 
level of a three-tiered circular platform in the center of this 
round chamber. Dim spheres of light shine in each dragon’s 
mouth, shifting between white, red, green, blue, and black.
 
An alcove to the north houses a 10-foot-wide shaft that 
leads up through the ceiling.
Shaft: The shaft to the north rises 100 feet into 
the fane’s inner sanctum (area 7). The stone walls are 
polished smooth (Athletics DC 30 to climb).
  Dragon Altar: A DC 30 Religion check reveals 
that the altar can be used by clerics to reinvigorate 
themselves. On a DC 44 Religion check, a PC real-
izes that only clerics who worship Tiamat will gain 
a benefit from standing in the center of the dragon 
heads. (The benefit to a disciple of Tiamat is the 
renewal of all daily powers and 1 extra action point, 
usable once per day.)
Encounter: Five-Headed Trap, page 159.
 
Any other creature that stands in the center of the 
circular platform triggers another Five-Headed trap 
as described above. However, the trap attacks only 
those standing on a tier of the platform.
Secret Door: A DC 25 Perception check reveals a 
secret door to the west.
Area 4: Chambers of Loss
The door to this chamber hangs on its hinges.
When the PCs look into area 4, read:
This once-opulent chamber has suffered from the depreda-
tions of time and, perhaps, looters. Thick carpets on the 
floor are rent and infested with sickly white lice. Tapestries, 
possibly once depicting Tiamat, hang in rags on the wall. A 
collapsed four-poster bed sits in the southeast corner of the 
chamber, its mattress stained with black and yellow mold.
The room contains one item that might be of interest 
to the PCs.
Water Pipe: A bejeweled water pipe lies beneath 
the bed. It is crafted to look like a five-headed dragon. 
Each head is a pipe stem, allowing up to five people 
to partake at the same time. A DC 30 Arcana check 
reveals a tinge of old magic in the water pipe, ren-
dering it unbreakable. Any other powers this object 
might have had have been eroded by time. However, 
the pipe is a rare relic of Tiamat, and to the proper 
collector of such trophies, it would be worth up to 
20,000 gp.
Area 5: Summoning Room
Like the door to area 4, this door to this chamber 
hangs on its hinges.
When the PCs look into area 5, read:
A complex circular diagram 10 feet in diameter is inscribed 
in the floor of this room. Signs and glyphs carved around 
the periphery of the ring are inlaid with silvery metal.
The ring acts as a permanent teleportation circle with 
a preset destination. Anyone looking through the 
portal sees a cloud-swept skyscape; the portal opens 
a few thousand feet above the Wyrmsmoke moun-
tains, directly above the chamber where the PCs now 
stand. If the characters don’t want to exit the temple 
through the hole in the air above the pews in area 1, 
they can leave by means of the circle.
Area 6: Treasury
The door to this chamber is secret and requires a DC 
35 Perception check to notice.
When the PCs look into area 6, read:
The hallway opens to accommodate a broad set of shal-
low steps leading up to a diamond-shaped chamber. Each 
stair is cracked, cut, and partially dissolved, as if having 
weathered years of violent elemental storms. The diamond-
shaped room contains a litter of smashed, looted chests, 
each apparently constructed from the scales of chromatic 
dragons.
The temple’s treasury was looted long ago. However, 
if the PCs search through the detritus and make a 
successful DC 25 Perception check, they spot a crack 
in the floor in which something catches the light—a 
large diamond (5,000 gp) that was overlooked by the 
thieves.
Area 7: Inner Sanctum (Level 30)
The PCs can reach this chamber by traveling up the 
shaft in area 3.
When the PCs look into area 7, read:
This roughly oval room is inscribed from top to bottom with 
a scalelike pattern that gives you the sense that the entire 
space lies inside a giant egg. Five oval balconies encircle the 
perimeter of the room. Four of them contain magnificent 
stone sculptures of chromatic dragons. The southernmost 
contains only rubble formed into a massive nest, which 
holds eight boulder-sized eggs that gleam like jewels. A 
flickering force of energy dances around the periphery 
of the nest. In the center of the chamber is a raised dais 
around which five stone dragon heads are poised. Each 
dragon head’s mouth glows with crackling energy.
Entering the chamber triggers the tactical encounter.

Setup
1 dragon guardian (D)
2 death titans (T)
When the PCs use the portal on the Elemental 
Chaos, it awakens creatures that Tiamat left to guard 
this 100-foot-tall chamber. One is an ancient black 
dragon touched by Tiamat; it has the blue and green 
bloodlines (see page 253; this creature is an exception 
to the rule that limits a dragon to one polychromatic 
bloodline). The dragon, now free from stasis, lies 
ready in the throat of the black abyss. Do not put its 
miniature on the map until the dragon acts.
 
The other two defenders are death titans that 
emerged from stasis in the hallway leading to area 3. 
The titans are not initially visible to those entering 
area 2; do not place their miniatures until their initia-
tive count comes up.
 
When a PC moves to within 5 squares of the 
abyss, allow her to roll a Perception check opposed by 
the dragon guardian’s Stealth check (d20 + 33). If the 
PC is successful, everyone rolls initiative. Otherwise, 
the dragon and the titans get a surprise round.

Tactics
The guardians fight to the death.
Surprise Round: If the monsters get a surprise 
round, the dragon peeks its head over the edge of the 
abyss and breathes its polychromatic breath at the 
closest PC. The death titans emerge, one after the 
other, from the hallway leading to area 3.
 
Round 1: The dragon flies out of its abyss and 
takes the attack to the intruders. It begins with its 
frightful presence, then spends an action point to use 
vitriolic spray. The dragon wants to take the PCs out 
quickly.
 
Each death titan stands back 5 squares from the 
front line and attempts to use soul devourer on a PC 
defender.
Round 2+: The dragon concentrates its attention 
on the PC (or PCs) that it judges to have been hurt 
the most by its attack in round 1, hoping to slay at 
least one intruder outright before targeting the rest. It 
spends another action point to accomplish this task.
 
The death titans wade in with their greataxes, 
using double attack as often as possible while waiting 
for soul devourer to recharge. If a death titan finds 
itself adjacent to more than one character and has a 
soul shard remaining, it uses soulfire burst.
Features of the Area
 
Illumination: Unless the PCs have a light source, 
the cavern remains in darkness. The dragon and the 
titans use their darkvision.
 
Cavern Floor: The thick stalagmites and fungi 
that clutter the floor of the cavern count as difficult 
terrain.
 
Cavern Tiers: The two tiers in the cavern each 
rise 10 feet higher than the next lower floor area.
 
Abyss: The pit is a vertical shaft whose topmost 
portion is filled with acid gloom, with properties 
identical to the black dragon’s ability of the same 
name, except that the pit’s acid gloom is permanent. 
The shaft descends 200 feet to a cold cave filled with 
rubble, bones, and a great pile of 5,000 pp (in which 
can be found 55 ad).

consort of Tiamat and the two dragonguard dragon-
born champions as shown on the tactical map.
 
If an intruder breaches the field protecting the

When a PC moves into the room, read:
The five dragon heads breathe a multicolored flare that 
seems as bright as the sun. In the blinking afterimage

in melee to wreak havoc with its frightful presence, mes-
merizing glare, and other abilities. The dragonguard

ing to force the intruders to focus on them instead of 
on the consort. If the PCs retreat, the dragon and the 
dragonguards follow.

above the floor.
Egg Nest: A flicker-
ing, divinely fashioned 
field protects eight eggs 
of Tiamat. A DC 35 
Arcana check or Reli-
gion check reveals that 
the field does not con-
sist of any recognizable 
effect. It is nigh invul-
nerable; the best way 
through the field is to 
use a True Portal ritual. 
A DC 45 Religion check reveals that doing so likely 
informs the divine entity responsible for the field that 
it is being tampered with.
 
If the True Portal ritual is performed, connecting 
the chamber with the protected balcony, the field 
collapses of its own accord. One round later, Tiamat 
appears in the center of the chamber, a raging deity 
intent on the destruction of her foes’ souls. See page 
245 for Tiamat’s statistics.
Tiamat’s Eggs: Each of the eight eggs is worth 
500,000 gp in celestial courts. If allowed to hatch, 
each egg would produce a son or daughter of Tiamat—
one for each major variety of chromatic dragon, 
including gray, brown, and purple. Use the eggs in 
your epic-level campaign however you see fit.

Dragons are a diverse body of creatures 
embodying a host of motivations, perspectives, and 
attitudes. The five varieties discussed in the Monster 
Manual are the most common kinds of chromatic 
dragons found in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS world, 
but they aren’t the only ones. Brown dragons haunt 
wastelands and deserts, while gray dragons lay claim 
to windswept peaks and purple dragons prowl the 
Underdark in search of treasure and slaves. Numer-
ous variations on typical chromatic dragons can also 
be found throughout the world—and beyond.
 
In addition to dragons themselves, countless servi-
tors, minions, and thralls bind themselves to these 
mighty beasts. From corrupted dragonborn to canny 
and furtive tribes of kobolds, these creatures link 
their own fates to the success or failure of a chromatic 
dragon. Such followers and associates seek to profit 
through this dark partnership, siphoning off the 
dragon’s treasure or stealing a measure of its power 
for themselves.
 
This chapter presents dozens of new creatures and 
other material, including the following sections and 
more:
✦ Game statistics and additional background mate-
rial for brown, gray, and purple dragons.
✦ Wyrmlings for each of the nine varieties of chro-
matic dragons.
✦ Variant dragons hailing from the planes.
✦ Undead dragons, even more terrible and more 
longer-lived (after a fashion) than their mortal 
counterparts.
✦ New drakes and other creatures related to drag-
ons, and even parasites unique to dragon hoards.
✦ Dragonborn who serve in Tiamat’s name, and 
ko bolds devoted to draconic ideals.
✦ Legendary dragons of the D&D world.
✦ Templates and alternative powers to customize 
dragons.

Brown, gray, and purple dragons are not so much 
new as newly recognized members of the chromatic 
dragon family.
BROWN DRAGON
ALSO REFERRED TO AS SAND DRAGONS, brown dragons 
of all the chromatics are least likely to head great 
armies, rule kingdoms, or otherwise seek to carve out 
empires. They prefer the comfort of their desert lairs 
and are at home below the earth.
 
In general, they are reserved, irritable, and cunning 
creatures that provide for themselves in whatever way 
requires the least amount of work on their part and 
avoids unnecessary trouble. Not unrelentingly evil, 
but not good either, sand dragons are motivated only 
by survival and comfort. Thus, a brown dragon would 
rather raid a herder’s flock than demand sacrifices 
from a nearby village (an act that is likely to bring 
adventurers from afar). Moreover, it does not inflict 
wholesale slaughter on the herd but instead culls 
one animal at a time, so that some will be left to eat 
another day. On the other hand, if antagonized suffi-
ciently by protective shepherds, a brown dragon might 
well destroy their village as a violent demonstration of 
what happens to those who deny a dragon its due.
 
The mass of thick, short horns protruding from 
a brown dragon’s head gives it a distinctive, earth-
gouging silhouette. A membranous frill connects each 
row of spines down the length of the dragon’s body. 
These frills function like wings, serving equally well 
for undulating flight through the air and burrowing 
through sand and earth.
Brown Dragon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
DC 15: More than any other kind of dragon, 
brown dragons are driven nearly as much by the 
desire to discover new tastes as by the need to 
accumulate a hoard. They so love eating that they 
sometimes take risks in combat merely to “sample” 
one or more of their foes. Thus, a brown dragon 
might take a bite instead of making a more tactically 
advantageous attack for the chance to taste an enemy, 
especially a creature it has not previously encoun-
tered. Brown dragons prize elf flesh for its succulence 
and tenderness, and least prefer dwarves, whose 
tough meat they consider unpalatable unless it is aged.
DC 20: A brown dragon’s breath weapon is a blast 
of supernaturally hot and stinging sand that corrodes 
flesh and blocks all visibility.

ROWN DRAGON

DC 25: A brown dragon makes its lair under the 
sands, in a hollow within a ruin, a cave, or a similar 
structure. A lair can consist of several such chambers, 
each one an island of air surrounded by an ocean 
of smothering sand. A brown dragon doesn’t need 
tunnels—it can burrow between the rooms of its lair 
without difficulty.
 
A brown dragon might keep a supply of food in 
its lair, usually smoked or seasoned meats but some-
times a stock of living creatures. It might set aside a

In addition to unusual food items, rare spices, and 
precious dishes and utensils, brown dragon hoards 
often contain treasures from civilizations that fell in 
earlier ages. They are likely to contain unique items 
(both mundane and magical) from long-extinct cul-
tures now hidden under the shifting sands. A brown 
dragon might use its treasure as bait for living prey, 
depositing a half-buried chest on the surface near a 
crossroads or an oasis to lure treasure-seekers.
DC 30: Brown dragons lay their eggs deep within 
loose earth, preferably sand. When the eggs hatch, 
the wyrmlings claw their way to the surface, giving 
the impression of springing spontaneously from the 
sand. Even newly hatched brown dragons have fully 
developed digging horns and claws, giving them the 
same burrowing ability as their parents.

Brown Dragon Tactics
A brown dragon prefers to remain out of sight under-
ground and keep track of foes with its tremorsense, 
waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. If it sur-
prises its target, the dragon bursts from the ground 
amid its enemies. It then uses sand cloud to flow over 
foes and blind them, followed by its breath weapon, 
which also creates a sand-filled region to provide 
shelter. On its next turn it uses frightful presence and 
strikes at stunned enemies, transforming into a sand 
cloud again if it is available, and spending an action 
point if necessary to burrow into the sand.
 
A brown dragon avoids attacks through a variety of 
abilities. It can evade conflicts by sinking below the 
earth, but when a brown dragon must fight, its sand 
cloud gives it protection and mobility. Older brown 
dragons set howling winds swirling around them-
selves for additional protection. An elder or ancient 
brown dragon can create a churning vortex of sand, 
while an ancient dragon can call forth a bone-flaying, 
shrieking sandstorm that can encompass an entire 
battlefield.
 
Despite its ability to take cover, a brown dragon 
relishes the opportunity to take a bite out of its 
enemies in combat. It might wax eloquent about the 
smell and taste of the just-bitten prey during the fight, 
and describe how it is looking forward to feasting on 
them all. (These boasts effectively contribute to its 
frightful presence.) Sometimes it grabs a fallen foe in its 
mouth and pulls it below the surface to continue its 
meal in safety.
Encounter Groups
When not encountered alone, a brown dragon might 
rely on servitors living around its buried lair to warn 
it of potential danger. Brown dragons occasionally 
employ mercenaries to travel abroad on special 
missions.
 
Sometimes a brown dragon employs agents (often 
kobolds) to bring it back new live food to sample. 
These servants might hunt down prey, but sometimes 
they instead purchase slaves using coin from their 
patron’s hoard.

EVA WIDERMANN
GRAY DRAGONS ARE THE MOST RAPACIOUS, venal, and 
brutish of all the chromatics. Their fierce love of the 
hunt drives them even more than their fondness for 
gold. They prefer to pursue humanoids or other intel-
ligent creatures, or prey that is dangerous enough to 
be a match for the dragon’s own ability. Some gray 
dragons are so enamored of the hunt that they eagerly 
work as mercenaries to track down fugitives (such as 
adventurers who have looted the keep of the dragon’s 
employer).
 
This dragon’s oversized mouth is a sea of fangs, 
and fanglike horns also protrude from its lower jaw, 
giving it a “beard” of fangs. Its body is armored with 
bony plates that rise into projecting spurs at limb 
joints, and its tail ends in twin, scythelike blades of 
bone. Its wide, long wings give the dragon command 
of the sky, from where it can look down on fleeing 
prey.
Gray Dragon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
DC 15: Gray dragons prefer badlands, scrubland, 
dry prairies, and other flatland terrain, where they 
can see potential quarry from miles around as they 
ride the thermals. Their eyesight is supernaturally 
acute, allowing them to distinguish a small herd of 
wild horses from a group of mounted humanoids at a 
height of miles.
 
DC 20: A gray dragon’s breath weapon is a caustic 
ooze that dissolves flesh on contact and for some time 
thereafter. The ooze becomes sticky on contact with 
air, hampering and burning the dragon’s prey.
 
Elder and ancient gray dragons have a special 
affinity with stone. They can exude a stony essence 
that petrifies foes that have been immobilized by 
their claw or breath weapon attack. An ancient gray 
dragon’s spikes have an elemental resonance that pet-
rifies not only the dragon’s primary targets, but also 
nearby creatures. This attack can leave a literal field 
of stone in its wake.
 
DC 25: While away from its lair on an extended 
hunt, a gray dragon establishes an outpost lair where 
it sleeps, feeds, and stores booty. Such an outpost is 
accessible only from the air and is not guarded, but 
the gray dragon returns to it each night after hunting.
 
Gray dragons habitually leave their permanent 
lairs abandoned for long periods. During its absence, 
a gray dragon seals its home lair off from both casual 
and determined exploration. The inmost areas of 
the lair are sealed with tons of stone in the form of 
boulders, limestone slabs, and even petrified victims. 
Medusas or giants defend the outlying chambers. 
These creatures do not necessarily serve the gray 
dragon but have agreed to share the lair complex for

DC 30: Gray dragons do not lay their eggs in their 
permanent lairs but distribute them widely in out-
post lairs. Hatching in such harsh conditions culls 
the weak from the breed. From the moment they 
hatch, gray dragon wyrmlings are capable of flight 
and hunting. Those that manage to survive their first 
months prove themselves tough enough to enjoy a 
long life.
 
DC 35: Originally gray dragons (then called fang 
dragons) were brutish creatures with no particular 
elemental power. It is said that a powerful entity, 
possibly Tiamat or her intermediaries, chose several 
unhatched gray dragon eggs to receive special treat-

infused with medusa blood, and brooded over by a

basilisk, these eggs underwent a year-long hatching 
ritual. When the first wyrmling emerged from its 
shell, Tiamat pulled it forth, named it Tanhumeth, 
and charged it with “purifying” its bloodline.
 
Tanhumeth, along with the rest of this singular 
brood, sought out and eradicated all the less well-
developed fang dragons that could be found. Only the 
newly invested gray dragons, with their oozing breath 
and petrifying attack, remain today. Occasionally an 
archaic fang dragon is discovered, living a solitary 
existence in some fell ravine. When news of this 
event reaches a gray dragon, it tracks down the infe-
rior specimen and executes Tiamat’s command.
Gray Dragon Tactics
When a gray dragon identifies a victim, it swoops 
from the belly of a cloud if possible, but otherwise 
dives from directly overhead, attempting to remain 
outside its prey’s field of vision. It uses frightful pres-
ence to stun foes, then spends an action point to 
unleash its breath weapon against them.
 
A gray dragon keeps to the air during a fight. 
While aloft, it can use its breath weapon and make 
attacks with its jagged claws and tail. These tactics 
allow the dragon to divide a group of targets so that 
it can focus on the greatest threats. If foes take to the 
air in attempt to close with it, the dragon focuses its 
attacks on a single flying opponent. If more than two 
enemies take wing, the dragon retreats to seek easier 
prey.
Encounter Groups
Most creatures encounter a gray dragon unexpect-
edly, surprised by a blast of acidic ooze. However, 
adventurers exploring a gray dragon’s lair might run 
afoul of its allied guardians. On rare occasions, gray

CONSUMMATE HUNTERS AND BORN MANIPULATORS, 
purple dragons delight in exploration more than any 
other wyrm, especially if that exploration leads far-
ther into the earth. They love discovering places below 
the roots of mountains never before trod by sentient 
creatures, and they dream about the wonders undis-
covered caverns might hold. For these reasons, purple 
dragons are sometimes referred to as deep dragons.
 
Purple dragons are relatively unknown on the sur-
face, and when they are seen in the cloaking shadow 
of subterranean settings are sometimes misidentified 
as black dragons. They are far more common in the 
Underdark, though still rarely seen.

PURPLE DRAGON
EVA WIDERMANN
 
A purple dragon is sinuous, serpentine, and agile 
as a cat, despite its great bulk. It has a slender head 
and neck and a set of swept-back narrow wings, all 
of which allow it to squeeze through narrow spaces. 
When illuminated, the scales of its armored body 
gleam with the deep purple luster of amethyst, but in 
dim light, the dragon looks nearly black.
Purple Dragon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
DC 15: Purple dragons are likely to be at odds 
with mind flayers and aboleths, possibly because they 
all desire to control other creatures.
DC 20: A purple dragon’s breath weapon is a 
billowing cloud of psychotropic vapor that erodes 
mental pathways on contact and continues to impair 
cognitive ability. This substance also allows the 
purple dragon to manipulate its victims’ movement.
 
Purple dragons can usurp control of the faltering 
perceptions of dazed and stunned foes with a mere 
look. Older dragons can inflict additional harm on 
dominated creatures, and an ancient purple dragon 
can even transfer a victim to a nightmare domain 
where it is assaulted by hordes of horrific dream-
creatures.
 
DC 25: Purple dragons do not lay their eggs in 
their lairs. Instead, they prepare hidden caches near

sunless seas or in air-filled but dark coastal caverns. 
Purple dragons prefer a diet of seafood: clams, fish, 
crabs, kuo-toas, and even aboleths.
 
DC 30: An ancient racial myth lies at the heart of 
purple dragons’ exploratory zeal. This legend speaks 
of a mystical realm called Azarakka that was hidden 
deep beneath the world before Io was slain by the 
King of Terror. Within this fabled cavern, so the 
legend goes, is a font of primeval knowledge set down 
by Io, knowledge so potent that a dragon that reads 
from it might gain power enough to capture a divine 
spark and so ascend to godhood.
Purple Dragon Tactics
When a purple dragon identifies intruders nearby, it 
approaches stealthily to learn what they might be up 
to. It might decide to let the intruders go on their way, 
but if it is hungry, feeling territorial, or wants some 
fun, it attacks. It begins with frightful presence; if it did 
not gain surprise, it spends an action point to unleash 
its breath weapon against the stunned foes. On its next 
turn it uses its gaze attack to dominate any creature 
that remains stunned, sending it to attack its allies.
 
A purple dragon delights in controlling other crea-
tures. It keeps to the periphery of a cavern during a 
fight, especially near a bolt-hole in case things turn 
bad. It moves enemies overcome by its breath weapon 
into disadvantageous positions while giving itself 
room to maneuver. Each round the dragon attempts 
to dominate and suborn more enemies, seeding chaos 
and fear among its foes.
 
Older purple dragons use their array of mental 
powers and physical manipulation to control the 
battlefield. They take advantage of their knowledge 
of nearby hollows and tunnels by using phasing strike 
to trap or separate foes who move too close, slap-
ping them right through a wall or a floor. An ancient 
purple targets the most dangerous combatant with 
nightmare prison to remove that enemy from combat 
while it deals with the others.
Encounter Groups
A purple dragon sometimes allies with a group of 
drow to accomplish a short-term goal. When a deep 
dragon needs to excavate a subterranean complex or 
ruin, it might call in laborers, sometimes supervised 
by drow. However, it can’t resist its urge to take con-
trol of any such group, and sooner or later the drow 
chafe under the oppression.

CHROMATIC WYRMLINGS
When a newly hatched dragon emerges from the 
egg, it is sodden in nutritive fluids and slightly stiff 
from never before having flexed its muscles. Within 
the day, though, the awkward wyrmling transforms 
into a creature already in possession of a full suite of 
powers and fully conscious of its surroundings.
 
Wyrmlings are sometimes confused with drakes 
or mundane reptilian creatures, but not for long.
Black Dragon Wyrmling
BLACK DRAGON WYRMLINGS HUNT THE EDGES of 
swamps and bogs beneath the cover of fetid vegeta-
tion and dank water. They are dependent on water, 
not only to ambush prey, but also to hide from larger 
creatures. They know their best chance to survive a 
hard world is to avoid attacking unless they are con-
fident of success. They are quick to learn the tactics 
of older black dragons, but in their early lives two or 
three might work together to bring down potentially 
tasty or dangerous prey.
 
A black wyrmling’s bony horns are mere nubs 
compared to those of older black dragons, but already 
the characteristic crescent shape that frames the 
snout is recognizable. On the other hand, its eyes and 
nostrils are not so sunken and skull-like as an adult’s. 
Its black scales are smeared with gray, dark green, 
and deep blue.

Black Dragon Wyrmling Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
DC 15: A black dragon lays its eggs in dismal 
forests and gloomy swamps—if possible, near areas 
where the Shadowfell’s influence is strong. Thus, its 
eggs are more difficult to find than those of other 
chromatic varieties, and more likely to survive long 
enough to hatch.
DC 20: Black dragon wyrmlings can breathe acid 
as older blacks can, but they do not possess an innate 
power over darkness.
Black Dragon Wyrmling 
Tactics
A black wyrmling begins an encounter in hiding, 
preferably beneath murky water. It emerges to use 
its breath weapon first, then closes on its foes, using 
its action point to make a double attack against the 
target that seems hurt worst by its breath. After 
that, it makes claw attacks against different oppo-
nents within reach or a bite attack against a single 
foe, blasting them again with its breath weapon if it 
recharges.
Encounter Groups
A black dragon wyrmling is usually encountered with 
its siblings, but sometimes one forms a short-term 
alliance with other beings, such as goblins. Occasion-
ally an older dragon teaches the tricks of the trade to 
youngsters.

Blue Dragon Wyrmling
AS THEY GROW TOWARD ADULTHOOD, blue dragon 
wyrmlings stick to the safety of small caves in hill-
sides, cliff faces, or mountain walls; sometimes they 
hunt from atop ancient stone ruins. They enjoy the 
safety of high places, and they instinctively love 
violent weather just as older blue dragons do. Blue 
dragon wyrmlings that live in seaside cliffs are 
exposed to tempests, and some are killed in the 
wrack of especially powerful storms. Those that sur-
vive such punishment are considered true scions of 
blue dragonkind.
 
The wyrmling’s brow horn is a good size from the 
moment it hatches, but otherwise its face is clear of 
growths. Its chin sports a cluster of elongated scales 
that resemble a beard, and its ears are large frills. 
Thick spikes form a sort of mane along its relatively 
short neck. Its scales are sky blue with a scattering of 
darker indigo patches.

Blue Dragon Wyrmling Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
DC 15: A blue dragon prefers to lay its eggs in high 
coastal caves that are difficult to reach from land as 
well as hard to detect. Blue dragon wyrmlings begin 
their lives eating fish and seabirds, along with the 
occasional shipwrecked sailor.
DC 20: Blue dragon wyrmlings can breathe light-
ning and produce electric blasts, but do not control 
thunder as older blues do.
Blue Dragon Wyrmling Tactics
Unless forced into melee on the ground, a blue 
dragon wyrmling is content to remain airborne, 
especially if it feels danger is about. It begins combat 
by unleashing its breath weapon, then spends its 
action point to follow up with lightning burst. When 
it becomes bloodied, the wyrmling flees from the 
threat and seeks easier prey elsewhere.
Encounter Groups
Blue dragon wyrmlings flock together, but they can 
also cultivate short-term relationships with other 
creatures. Ettercaps that have lairs near coasts or 
other locations where blue dragons hatch sometimes 
placate the wyrmlings by working with them, and 
sometimes victims of the wyrmlings’ hunger do not 
depart immediately.

Brown Dragon 
Wyrmling
WHILE STILL YOUNG AND VULNERABLE (for a dragon), 
brown wyrmlings seek the safety of burrowing. They 
hunt in hollow spaces below the desiccated earth, 
whether natural or the ruins of fallen civilizations. 
Brown wyrmlings venture to the surface only at 
twilight for added safety. Brown dragons are already 
known for their distaste for interaction with other 
creatures; their wyrmlings are doubly isolated.
 
The scales of a brown dragon wyrmling shade 
from sandy brown along its stomach to darker brown 
on its back.

Brown Dragon Wyrmling Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
 
DC 15: A brown dragon lays its eggs in one of 
the deeper hollows of its lair. It might protect its 
wyrmlings for the first few years after hatching, but 
eventually it pushes them out of the lair to a nearby 
buried ruin.
 
DC 20: Brown wyrmlings are as gluttonous as 
their parents and can sometimes be lured to the 
surface, even in obviously unsafe situations, by the 
promise of food. Overeager wyrmlings have lost their 
lives or their freedom through such ploys.
Brown Dragon Wyrmling 
Tactics
Like adults, brown wyrmlings prefer to remain out 
of sight under the ground, using tremorsense to keep 
tabs on potential prey. They rely more on their ability 
to burrow than adults do because their abilities are 
not yet finely honed. A wyrmling begins a fight with 
a blast of its breath weapon, then uses its action point 
to become a sand cloud and rush over its foes. It fights 
ferociously, but when it becomes bloodied, it uses its 
recharged breath weapon in an attempt to blind foes, 
then burrows to safety.
Encounter Groups
Brown wyrmlings burrow in isolation, but sometimes 
scavengers run with them, as interested as they are in 
sampling carrion or taking down fresh prey.

Gray Dragon Wyrmling
LIKE THEIR ELDERS, gray dragon wyrmlings enjoy 
hunting from the heights. Their smaller size some-
times causes other creatures to misidentify them 
as hawks or other birds of prey until it is too late to 
escape.
 
A gray wyrmling’s mouth doesn’t have as many 
fangs as an older gray’s, but it still packs in too many 
teeth for comfort. Its tail ends in the stubs of what 
will eventually grow into twin blades of bone. Its 
color shades from off-white along its belly to gray 
along its sides and back.

Gray Dragon Wyrmling Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
DC 15: Gray dragons lay their eggs in outpost 
lairs left over from earlier hunting trips. When a gray 
leaves its outpost, it takes any treasure that it gathered 
for its hoard but might leave behind an egg or two.
DC 20: Gray wyrmlings can’t petrify their foes as 
older grays can. Also unlike older grays, they prefer to 
work with siblings and other creatures.
Gray Dragon Wyrmling Tactics
A gray wyrmling enjoys the hunt as much as an adult, 
but it might choose merely to follow and observe a 
creature or group it judges too strong for it. It takes 
the opportunity to attack when a distraction occurs 
(such as its quarry being attacked by another beast of 
the badlands).
 
An attacking wyrmling dives with surprise if pos-
sible. It unleashes its breath weapon first and follows 
up with a mix of physical attacks, using its breath 
weapon again when it recharges. After battle is joined, 
a gray wyrmling stays in the fight to the bitter end 
even if it is losing—it exults too much in the contest to 
realize when the odds have turned against it.
Encounter Groups
Gray wyrmlings sometimes hunt in pairs. A single 
wyrmling might follow a likely prospect for miles if 
it knows the victim is heading into an ambush, flying 
overhead like a buzzard and waiting for its chance to 
snag a meal.

ability to manipulate would-be victims has not yet 
developed. On the other hand, older greens learn 
their tricks from all the mistakes they made as wyrm-
lings (assuming they survive).
 
A green wyrmling is a slender, agile creature. A 
crown of five horn buds rings the back of its skull, 
and a pronounced spike juts from the tip of its narrow 
snout. A wyrmling’s scales range from deep forest 
green along its spine to rich emerald on its head and

and more massive, the better.
 
DC 20: Green wyrmlings have the poisonous 
breath and bite of older greens but lack the ability to 
take control of poisoned foes.
Green Dragon Wyrmling 
Tactics
Green wyrmlings would rather lead prey into a trap 
or otherwise use deceit to render it defenseless rather 
than fight, but sometimes nothing else will do.
 
In combat, a wyrmling uses luring glare to draw 
foes closer (possibly over a concealed pit trap), then 
hits them with its breath weapon. After the first round, 
it continues to move foes around with its glare, 
attempting to put them into disadvantageous posi-
tions before it strikes with tooth and claw.
 
A green wyrmling doesn’t hesitate to retreat if 
the battle turns against it. A particularly defensive-
minded one conserves its action point for a quick 
escape.
Encounter Groups
Green wyrmlings are encountered with various 
creatures of the forest. They know the value of 
alliance, and their deceit can reliably forge such 
arrangements. Sometimes a green wyrmling is 
“adopted” by a small band of elf foragers who, while 
wary of the dragon’s lies, wish to learn what it knows 
of the territory.

A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
DC 15: Purple dragons usually lay their eggs in 
their lairs. Sometimes they instead use the structures 
of previous Underdark residents, if the chambers 
and connecting hallways are elaborate enough for 
their taste—especially if these offer secure incubation 
space. A purple dragon lays its eggs along with the 
corpse of an unjustly slain creature that is likely to 
rise as a wraith or other shadowy undead entity. Not 
only does this spirit guard the eggs, but its necrotic 
energy somehow infuses the developing wyrmlings, 
touching them with a vestige of the Raven Queen’s 
power.
DC 20: Purple wyrmlings possess only a fraction 
of their elders’ ability to manipulate other creatures. 
Even though a wyrmling can attempt to dominate 
only once every few minutes, that moment of control 
can still ruin its victim.

CHROMATIC WYRMLINGS
Purple Dragon Wyrmling 
Tactics
Purple wyrmlings like to stay hidden in small tun-
nels and subterranean vents, not only to stay out of 
the sun’s deadly rays but also to remain unnoticed 
by more powerful creatures that call the Underdark 
home.
 
When a purple wyrmling notices a disturbance 
near its territory, it stealthily approaches but doesn’t 
immediately attack, instead assessing the threat 
compared to the food potential. If it decides to fight, 
it attempts to gain surprise and uses that advantage 
to catch prey in its breath weapon. As soon as it can 
act again, it uses dominating gaze to control a creature 
that was dazed by its breath and direct it to attack an 
ally. From then on, the wyrmling uses its claws and 
bite to take down the weakest targets, reserving its 
action point for escape.
Encounter Groups
The affinity between undead and purple dragons is 
demonstrated by the company their wyrmlings keep. 
Sometimes a purple wyrmling makes a deal with 
other Underdark dwellers, in return for desirable 
food such as subterranean fish.

Red Dragon Wyrmling
RED DRAGON WYRMLINGS ARE A SCOURGE wherever 
they appear. Unlike other wyrmling varieties, they 
are not concerned with caution or living long enough 
to grow into larger, more dangerous versions. Red 
wyrmlings take on any creature that looks edible.
 
A red wyrmling is nearly identical to a fully grown 
red dragon, except for its size. Its distinctive serrated 
horns sweep back behind its head, though the smaller 
horns are mere stubs. The dragon’s scales are brilliant 
scarlet, fading to pink on its belly.

Red Dragon Wyrmling Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
 
DC 15: A red dragon lays its eggs deep under-
ground near a natural source of heat, such as the 
empty lava tubes of a simmering volcano, which 
helps them develop. After the wyrmlings hatch, the 
little beasts turn on each other, fighting until only 
one remains. If a clutch hasn’t done this within a few 
months of hatching, the dragons usually get along 
until they go their separate ways.
 
DC 20: A red wyrmling has a breath weapon 
and can manage a single tail strike against a flank-
ing enemy, but it lacks the more deadly qualities of a 
mature red. Rarely does a red wyrmling flee a fight; 
sometimes, this ferocity is enough to swing the battle 
back to the dragon’s favor after its foes expect it to 
give up.

RON SPENCER
Red Dragon Wyrmling 
Tactics
A red wyrmling fearlessly approaches its enemies 
and unleashes its fiery breath, then spends its action 
point to make a double attack. If it becomes blood-
ied, the wyrmling directs its recharged breath 
weapon against the foe for which it holds the most 
animosity.
 
Unlike more mature reds, wyrmlings are battle-
crazed. When their blood is up, they fight to the 
death, no matter the odds.
Encounter Groups
Red dragon wyrmlings stay near their hatchery for 
the first few years of life, but afterward they disperse 
in search of food and lairs of their own.
 
Some dragonborn enjoy the company of dragons, 
especially reds. Since mature dragons are difficult to 
work with, red wyrmlings are the best choice.

White Dragon 
Wyrmling
WHITE DRAGONS GROW QUICKLY but are more fero-
cious than cunning; most die before maturing. White 
wyrmlings are nasty blights of cold and bestial 
hunger that blow in with cold weather out of the 
mountains, looking for food and treasure.
 
A white wyrmling’s head crest is less pronounced 
than an adult’s, and its throat and chin are smoothly 
scaled, lacking the dewlap and spike of an adult. It 
has only a hint of horns on the ridges over its eyes and 
ears. The rest of its body has yet to develop scales and 
is instead protected by leathery white hide.

White Dragon Wyrmling Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
DC 15: A white dragon lays its eggs in a cold, 
remote location. Although low temperature is not 
necessary for the eggs to hatch, it does season the 
wyrmlings to their environment and might be neces-
sary for developing resistance to cold. Ice caves in 
glaciers are best, but deep crevasses or hollows in 
frozen tundra can also serve. After a clutch of white 
wyrmlings hatches, the creatures take a few hours 
to clean themselves and gather their strength. But 
within the day, they are out of the hatchery, hunting 
for their first meals.
DC 20: White wyrmlings have a chilling breath 
weapon that slows and weakens foes just like that 
of mature whites, and they can also lash out with a 
flurry of claws and fangs. However, they can’t call 
upon the frigid power of older dragons. Like red 
wyrmlings, they fight to the bitter end, and some-
times their brutality can help them win out.
White Dragon Wyrmling Tactics
A white wyrmling is bestially aggressive. It swoops 
down from above or springs out of a hiding place 
beneath snow or ice, then unleashes its breath weapon. 
Thereafter, the wyrmling uses dragon’s fury until its 
breath weapon recharges. After breathing, it uses its 
action point to slash at the most seriouslywounded 
enemy with dragon’s fury, hoping to finish it in that 
round. White wyrmlings fight until slain.
Encounter Groups
White wyrmlings disperse widely from their hatch-
eries in just a few months, hunting and eating to 
gluttonous excess. They stay within flying distance of 
snow-covered peaks, tundra, or glacial plains, though 
boreal forests can host infestations of them, especially 
in the winter.
 
Sometimes kobolds attempt to tame a white 
dragon hatched from a plundered egg. This tactic 
often ends poorly for the would-be dragontamer, but 
occasionally it succeeds. Dragonborn sometimes 
are able to work with white wyrmlings and keep 
them as pets, although the creatures are too vicious 
and unpredictable for civilized environments. 
Occasionally white wyrmlings are encouraged by 
blandishments of treasure and food to briefly join 
forces with minor intelligent undead.

MIGUEL COIMBRA
Sometimes chromatic dragons live and breed in 
otherworldly environments. Those that remain in 
another plane long enough are radically altered by its 
nature or its denizens.
 
Some planar dragons are solo threats, every bit as 
dangerous as their mortal counterparts, but others 
have changed so drastically that they can fill other 
encounter roles as well.
ABYSSAL DRAGONS
The Abyss devours. A hungry pit that consumes and 
destroys all that venture into its depths, it is a place 
of unrivaled devastation and appalling violence. 
Chromatic dragons that descend into the Abyss are 
transformed into agents of ruin, either at the hands 
of the plane’s demonic overseers or by the nature of 
the realm. Abyssal dragons are little more than living 
siege engines, though a few become powerful enough 
to become lords in their own right.
Frostforged Wyrm
DEMONS SOMETIMES CAPTURE WHITE DRAGONS from 
the natural world to “improve” in the forges of the 
Abyss. The frostforged wyrm is the result: a tortured 
beast, outfitted with heavy plates of cold-forged iron

fixed in place with cruel nails. No matter how hard 
the dragon struggles to free itself, minuscule demons 
scramble over its back to secure the armor plates.
 
The dragon’s original nature is barely recogniz-
able under the mass of spiked metal. Plumes of mist 
rise from its head plate, and a rime of frost accumu-
lates around it. Such tormented creatures rarely live 
long—they are either killed by the demons or driven 
to death by their harsh masters, who see them only as 
expendable tools designed to spread carnage.
Frostforged Wyrm Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana check.
 
DC 20: Frostforged wyrms are not native to the 
Abyss but have been brought there by force. Sub-
jected to terrible torments and modifications, they 
serve as weapons of destruction in the wars raging 
through the layers of that darkened realm.

Driven to the brink of madness, this abyssal dragon 
shrieks in pain and hatred as it ravages its enemies. It 
fights fiercely, unleashing its breath weapon first and 
following through with melee attacks against any 
target it can reach. The frostforged wyrm is at its most 
dangerous when bloodied, so its demonic tormentors 
cruelly drive the armor’s hooks into its flesh to spur it 
on, even if doing so ultimately kills the beast.

Deathmask Dragon
FEW ABYSSAL DRAGONS ARE AS STRANGE AS THIS ONE. 
Whenever a deathmask dragon slays a living crea-
ture, it devours the creature’s essence, adding both 
flesh and spirit to its own.
 
This disgusting monster resembles a purple 
dragon in only the loosest sense. Its slender, snake-
like body is supported by dozens of legs like those 
of a centipede, each breaking through the flesh and 
dripping with black corruption. Small black wings 
emerge from its back, able to carry the dragon despite 
their size. The long body eventually tapers into a 
slender tail, and its serpentine neck ends in a wide 
head. Twisted, leering faces peer out from between its 
scales, mouthing their private suffering and moaning 
with each scuttling step.
Deathmask Dragon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana check.
DC 25: The deathmask dragon is a demonic har-
binger of death, its body made up of the myriad souls 
it has devoured. The dragon grows larger as it feeds

Deathmask Dragon Tactics
The deathmask dragon displays a frightful eagerness 
to kill. It begins by loosing a terrible wail of death, fill-
ing the minds of its enemies with memories of the 
dragon’s crimes. Its victims relive the horror with 
each attack they make and are scourged by self-loath-
ing and madness. Those who manage to resist might 
still be shaken by the dragon’s frightful presence, and 
its breath weapon also disrupts and scatters its foes. 
Each round it targets one or more enemies with mask 
of dread, choosing those that have successfully saved 
against or were unaffected by wail of death.
Encounter Groups
Demons exploit abyssal dragons as steeds and war 
machines. Abyssal dragons can support hordes of 
fiends bidding to expand their power beyond the 
Abyss, or protect the personal lairs of mighty demon 
lords—having such a guardian is a mark of great 
power.

ASTRAL DRAGONS
Floating in the endless expanse of the Astral Sea are 
the dominions of the gods and their immortal ser-
vants. Astral dragons are chromatic dragons that have 
lived in the realm so long that they have diverged 
from their forebears. These magnificent beasts came 
to the Astral Sea out of a sense of duty or by divine 
command, and they have absorbed features of this 
plane over the long ages spent there.
Battle Dragon
BATTLE DRAGONS ARE PRIZED for their warlike cun-
ning and loyalty. They serve diverse gods, including 
Kord, Bane, and even Gruumsh, and support their 
deity’s mortal servants. Battle dragons lend their 
might to holy champions in wars against their ene-
mies, whether foul demons and devils or the servants 
of rival gods.

dragon fills them with renewed vigor by screaming 
its ululating battle cry. It is loath to quit the battlefield, 
but it’s savvy enough to know when the cause is lost. 
Before departing, it delivers a vicious bite for its oppo-
nents to remember it by.
Pact Dragon
PACT DRAGONS ARE THE DESCENDANTS of the red drag-
ons that originally formed a pact with the githyanki 
(see page 129 of the Monster Manual). They resemble 
red dragons but are smaller and more compact. A 
pact dragon’s scales are dark, running toward deep 
crimson, while its eyes are silvery white, matching 
the Astral Sea through which it flies.
Pact Dragon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Religion check.
DC 25: When the gith broke from the tyrannical 
rule of the mind flayers, they fled into the Astral Sea. 
The githzerai broke with their kin after the githyanki 
headed down the path toward despotism, taking 
nearly half the gith population with them. To survive, 
the githyanki turned to Tiamat for aid; after tense 
negotiations, they won the service of the red dragons. 
In the centuries that followed, their descendants have 
come to be known as pact dragons, named for that 
ancient bargain between the githyanki and the Dark 
Lady of Avarice.
DC 30: The pact dragons serve the githyanki only 
as long as Vlaakith, their first queen, remains in the 
service of Tiamat.

ELEMENTAL DRAGONS
The Elemental Chaos is the stuff of creation: limitless 
possibility and endless destruction combined in utter 
disorder. The plane’s forces work against creatures 
that linger here, so they acquire its dangerous and 
unpredictable qualities. All creatures are susceptible 
to such alterations, but dragons react intensely to the 
awakening of their elemental nature; chromatic drag-
ons seem especially prone to this transformation. Few 
elemental dragons escape their realm, but those that 
do settle in places compatible with their forms.

JAMES ZHANG (2)
DC 25: In the Chaos, blazewyrms travel in small 
family groups of two to three members, but every 
few years a number of groups join in a huge mating 
moot. This event produces a vast conglomeration of 
writhing fire, called a mother blazewyrm. This con-
glomerate creature survives for a week or two, then 
splits into hundreds of individual blazewyrms (about 
half again as many as initially combined).
Blazewyrm Tactics
When a blazewyrm spots new victims, it lays down 
a blast of tumbling flame and teleports close to an 
enemy, then uses its action point to lash out with 
blazewyrm fury. It continues to use the latter attack 
as much as possible, keeping one or more of its foes 
within its body blaze as it does so. When it becomes 
bloodied, it uses tumbling flame again to finish off a 
weakened enemy or to make an escape.
 
A blazewyrm values its own life less than the joy 
of making things burn. It fights flammable creatures 
to the death but attempts to flee from those that are 
resistant to fire.
Dragon Eel
A DRAGON EEL SWIMS THROUGH THE GULFS of air and 
water of the Elemental Chaos, moving freely from 
churning currents to swirling winds, eternally hunt-
ing. A dragon eel might slip into the world in a deep 
ocean trench or during a terrible storm. A ship cap-
tain who discovers the newcomer must either fight it 
off or negotiate successfully—most such unfortunates

The head of this long, narrow dragon is blunt and 
streamlined, and its neck is nearly nonexistent. Along 
with the fins that run its length, it also has two wings 
resembling those of a manta ray.

MIGUEL COIMBRA
ELEMENTAL DRAGONS
Dragon Eel Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana check.
DC 25: Dragon eels have a taste for humanoid 
flesh. A dragon eel is usually satisfied with snatching 
a sailor or two off a ship’s deck, but sometimes it holes 
the side of a sailing vessel below the waterline. The 
ship then sinks, allowing the creature to devour the 
helpless crew at its leisure.
Dragon Eel Tactics
Since a dragon eel can swim and fly with equal facil-
ity, it launches an attack from underwater against 
targets on land or aboard ship. When it is engaged, 
it keeps to the air. It begins a fight with its breath 
weapon, then moves in to bite. It prefers to grab and 
swallow a bloodied foe. If the fight goes against it, the 
dragon eel dives back below the surface or, if fighting 
aquatic foes, takes to the air to escape.
Tempest Dragon
DRIFTING WITH THE CURRENTS OF THE FLOATING 
OCEANS, swimming along rivers of lightning, or caper-
ing in the thunderheads that rumble and writhe 
in the Elemental Chaos are the tempest dragons. 
Imbued with the churning power of hurricanes and 
deadly maelstroms, a tempest dragon visits ruin 
wherever it travels.
 
A tempest dragon is composed entirely of water, 
yet it is just as smart as other dragons. It can assume 
any shape it desires but prefers to adopt a form resem-
bling that of a transparent blue dragon. Tangles of 
seaweed and sweeps of sand are suspended within its 
oddly bright body.

DC 20: Tempest dragons seek out storms and 
cloud banks, or areas where such formations occur. 
The presence of a tempest dragon might breed more 
storms than normal in a given area.
Tempest Dragon Tactics
A tempest dragon is aggressive, engulfing foes within 
its watery aura and then using lightning discharge to 
electrocute them. It uses this tactic for as long as it 
has action points, moving each round to affect as 
many opponents as possible. If the battle goes against 
it, it thins its form into a cloud of water droplets, phas-
ing through obstacles to make a getaway.

Pyroclastic Dragon
NO DRAGON BETTER REFLECTS THE FURY of the Elemen-
tal Chaos than does this one. Dwelling in the plane’s 
most violent regions, pyroclastic dragons can survive 
in places inimical to other life. They thrive on a diet 
of molten ores and minerals, but they savor roasted 
flesh whenever they can get it.
 
A pyroclastic dragon is a mountainous creature 
composed of molten rock contained by a thin crust of 
cooled stone. Its craggy maw gapes to reveal a white-
hot core. It has the general shape and features of a red 
dragon, but its body vents poisonous gases from the 
numerous rents and fissures that split its stony hide.

Pyroclastic Dragon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana check.
DC 20: Pyroclastic dragons settle in the calderas 
of active volcanoes. They swim about in the lava, 
sometimes diving deep into the magma veins to see 
what can be found below. The mere presence of such 
a dragon causes the earth to rebel: Venomous fissures 
split the ground, while tremors roll out from wher-
ever the dragon goes.
Pyroclastic Dragon Tactics
A pyroclastic dragon is an unsubtle opponent that 
explodes into violence when provoked. It unleashes 
its breath weapon the first chance it gets, coating its 
victims in molten rock that cools, slowing and even-
tually halting its enemies. The dragon uses tremors
against any that have not been so incapacitated. It 
then uses an action point to shatter its foes with its 
powerful bite and jagged claws.

Though elemental dragons are denizens of the Chaos, 
sometimes they slip across the planar veil and find a

FEYWILD DRAGONS
EVA WIDERMANN
FEYWILD DRAGONS
The planar dragons of the Feywild, like the places 
and creatures of that plane, reflect their counterparts 
in the world, capturing the essence of their being and 
infusing them with incredible arcane power. Those 
dragons hatched in the Feywild are decidedly more 
magical than others.
Feywild Dragon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana check.
DC 20: Feywild dragons possess magical ability, 
allowing them to manipulate their environments or 
torment the minds of enemies.
 
They are driven to populate their hoards with 
ritual books and with implements of arcane magic. 
They enjoy fine health and great longevity, which 
might be due to indirect magical influence or to hap-
piness from owning such enviable possessions.
DC 30: Eladrin myth describes kinds of Feywild 
dragons other than those presented here. Some are 
no bigger than a sparkle of light, while others are 
so large that their spiny backs resemble mountain 
ranges. In a place where nearly any wonder is pos-
sible, these stories might well be true.
Faerie Dragon
FAERIE DRAGONS FLIT OVER UNSPOILED FOREST GROVES 
and shining eladrin citadels, absorbing the heat of the 
clear sunlight on their iridescent wings and croon-
ing their melodious songs day and night. Visitors to 
the Feywild’s flower-speckled meadows or groves 
of ancient trees can’t travel far without drawing the

attention of a flock of faerie dragons, which accom-
pany them with singing and amazing aerial displays. 
If danger threatens, the flock disperses in a twinkling. 
But faerie dragons are mischievous and curious, and 
they can’t stay away long when something interesting 
is going on.
 
A faerie dragon is about the size of a dog, far 
smaller than any true dragon, but its form is clearly 
draconic. Its iridescent scales reflect all the colors of 
the rainbow, and its butterfly wings flutter so rapidly 
in flight that they become a shimmer of multicol-
ored light. Its constant amusement with the world is 
revealed by a grin that grows especially broad when 
the dragon is up to something roguish.
Faerie Dragon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana check.
 
DC 20: Faerie dragons have no clear ancestry, 
though eladrin sages opine that they first came into 
being as Feywild echoes of dragons in the world.
 
DC 25: Faerie dragons keep their distance from 
intruders, preferring to lead such creatures away 
from their forest homes rather than confronting them 
directly. When possible, they lure aggressors toward 
dryads, satyrs, or other creatures capable of dealing 
with a threat, then either assist in the flight or flit away. 
Faerie dragons rarely initiate hostilities—they are more 
likely to trail and spy on intruders—though flocks of 
these creatures have been known to attack interlopers.

Mirage Dragon
DWELLING IN PRISTINE FEYWILD FORESTS untouched by

mirage dragons are reclusive creatures. Though they 
rarely deign to interact with others, mirage dragons

their independence and reluctance to become involved 
in the conflict between light and dark.
 
A mirage dragon has a long, serpentine body, 
covered in deep emerald scales, and a wedge-shaped 
head. Despite its small size, its wings readily lift it 
into the air. All mirage dragons grow soft, brilliant 
feathers behind their jaws, giving them vibrant

FEYWILD DRAGONS
Mirage Dragon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana check.
DC 25: Mirage dragons might be descended from 
ancient chromatics (perhaps greens) that took up 
residence in the Feywild. They maintain close ties to 
the eladrin, and they are companions and steeds to 
eladrin nobles. They can be playful tricksters or dan-
gerous manipulators.
Mirage Dragon Tactics
A mirage dragon avoids combat, manipulating the 
minds of its foes to buy time for retreat. It leads with 
frightful presence to soften up its enemies, then uses 
its breath weapon to damage their minds and flutters 
off. However, if angered, it picks distracted foes apart 
with its venomous bite while tormenting the rest with 
phantom harrier and mirage.
Wretch Dragon
SENTINELS OF FOMORIAN ENCLAVES in the Underdark 
of the Feywild, wretch dragons are every bit as horrid 
and unsightly as their grim masters. The fomorians 
enslaved these gruesome reflections of purple drag-
ons on the mortal world to serve in their ongoing war 
against the hated eladrin and other creatures of beauty.
 
Wretch dragons are aptly named: Their bodies 
shudder with disgusting growths and swellings. 
Grown corpulent on the rancid leavings of their mas-
ters, these creatures are far bulkier than their natural 
counterparts, with a thick layer of fat covering their 
muscular frames.

A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana check.
DC 25: Wretch dragons are hatched in well-
protected crèches within fomorian cities. The 
fomorians keep the young dragons on a special diet 
to speed their growth.
Wretch Dragon Tactics
For all its hideousness, a wretch dragon is highly 
intelligent and employs a nightmarish array of 
powers to protect the fomorian painbringers that it 
accompanies. The dragon draws opponents with its 
wretched curse and then blows them away with the 
psychic assault of its breath weapon. Foes facing the 
creature must beware of the ichorous growths that 
stud its flesh: Dealing enough damage to the dragon 
causes these to explode, showering nearby creatures 
with necrotic filth.
Encounter Groups
Mirage dragons have little interest in the conflicts 
between good and evil, but fomorians offend their 
aesthetic sensibilities. Wretch dragons sometimes slip 
into the depths of the Feywild’s Underdark, hunting 
their former masters. Faerie dragons can be found 
nearly anywhere in the Feywild, in the company of 
any creature that will put up with them.

Blight Dragon Tactics
A blight dragon begins a fight in the air. It uses fright-
ful presence to pin its enemies in place, then spends 
an action point to spew its breath weapon: a searing 
wind of grit and dust that rots whatever it touches. It 
descends to make gruesome bite attacks, as well as 
to ravage its enemies with its ruin aura, retreating as 
necessary to heal itself with vital fluids drained from 
its enemies. If the dragon feels overwhelmed, it stirs 
up a vicious dust storm to cover its retreat.

SHADOWFELL DRAGONS
Shadow Dragon
SHADOW DRAGONS ARE TREACHEROUS MONSTERS
that prowl in the darkest corners of the Shadowfell. 
Whether skulking in the deeps of the plane’s Under-
dark or commanding armies from the ruins of old 
cities infested with undead, shadow dragons are a 
dreadful force in this realm.
 
At a glance, a shadow dragon appears insubstan-
tial. Its dark hide and translucent scales help it blend 
into its dim surroundings. Shadow dragons might be 
mistaken for black dragons, but their heads feature 
rows of backward-pointing horns. A long fringe of 
spines emerges from the back of the dragon’s neck, 
and its powerful tail features a swimming fin.
Shadow Dragon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana check.
DC 25: Shadow dragons infest crumbling cities 
and sunken palaces. They are greedy and rapacious, 
even for dragons, and hungry for power and wealth. 
Shadow dragons enslave other races to serve them as 
soldiers and servants.
Shadow Dragon Tactics
A shadow dragon never fights fair. It lurks in the 
darkness, biding its time for the proper moment 
to strike. In fact, a shadow dragon might follow its 
quarry for hours before revealing itself. When it 
finally strikes, it drops globes of darkness, then uses 
shadow walk to move to the best position for its breath 
weapon, spending an action point to use it on that 
turn. While its foes struggle against the rotting power 
of that attack, the dragon tears into them with fangs 
and claws, spawning additional globes of darkness to 
help it teleport about the battlefield.

RICK SARDINHA
Long-lived as they are, some dragons remain in the 
world, active and malicious, even when heartbeats 
falter and necrotic energy instead of blood provides 
animation.
DRACOLICH
As described in the Monster Manual, a dracolich is 
created from a powerful dragon through an evil 
ritual. Some dragons willingly choose to become 
sentient undead; others have the ritual forced upon 
them. Dracoliches are greedy for power and treasure, 
but individuals pursue other goals equally passion-
ately. Dracoliches can arise from dragon families 
other than the chromatic, but chromatics are most 
prone to the transformation.
Bone Mongrel 
Dracolich
A DRAGON DOES NOT BECOME this sort of dracolich by 
choice. A bone mongrel is created from the remains 
of several dead dragons to form an animate and dully 
sentient whole.
 
This skeletal dragon is about the size of a large 
horse, with a malevolent light burning in its eye sock-
ets. The denuded bones forming the creature clearly 
do not match, and the dragon’s skull shows rivets 
where the lower jaw and various horns have been 
attached.

DRACOLICH
Stoneborn Dracolich
SOMETIMES WHEN A DRAGON DIES, its body comes to 
rest at the bottom of a lake or a slow-moving river. 
The corpse is covered over and protected by silt, dirt, 
and loose rock, slowing the natural process of decay. 
Over vast periods of time, the bone is replaced by 
stone-hard mineral.
 
Unlike other fossilized remains, the decaying 
forms of dragons still retain a spark of magic. When 
such bones are uncovered, they can spontaneously 
arise as stoneborn dracoliches. Occasionally sorcerers 
raise the bones by inscribing them with necromantic 
sigils.
 
A stoneborn dracolich is a skeletal creature com-
posed of petrified bone. Parts of it are still partially 
imprisoned in rock, yet it moves, albeit stiffly. The 
dragon’s skeletal wings are partially broken and 
chipped, and its tail ends in a crude block of stone.

Stoneborn Dracolich Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Religion check.
DC 20: Stoneborn dracoliches arise spontaneously 
when their remains are uncovered, or when a nearby 
powerful magical event triggers the animation of the 
long-quiescent bones.
DC 30: A necromantic ritual exists to rouse a col-
lection of fossilized dragon bones, turning them into 
a stoneborn dracolich. As with other kinds of dra-
coliches, only the original creator can influence the 
actions of a stoneborn dracolich while possessing its 
phylactery—others who later gain the phylactery have 
no power over it. A stoneborn’s phylactery takes the 
form of a petrified tooth or claw removed from the 
dragon’s remains.
DC 35: Stoneborn dracoliches possess memories 
of events going back thousands of years. They might 
know the names of primordials, remember the loca-
tions of great cities of long-vanished civilizations, and 
be concerned with momentous events long ago con-
cluded (or no longer known).
Stoneborn Dracolich Tactics
A stoneborn dracolich begins combat with its breath 
weapon, pinning its foes with stony splinters. It then 
spends an action point to use frightful presence and 
stone fury to overwhelm its enemies.
 
The dracolich’s most potent weapon punishes 
those that dare to attack it in melee. Whenever it suf-
fers an injury, the bone and rock of its body explode 
outward, slicing through nearby foes. Thus, defeating 
one of these monsters can dearly cost its attackers.
Icewrought Dracolich
WHEN COLD WINDS BLOW FROM THE GLACIERS and 
winter’s breath is especially chill, the night is filled 
with howling, freezing cries. Sometimes these are the 
hunting calls of an icewrought dracolich.
 
This creature looks like a curling, frothing ocean 
wave that froze solid at the point of crashing onto 
rocky cliffs. The icy form has a vague likeness to that 
of a skeletal dragon, taking clear shape when it sud-
denly unfurls its wings. In its frost skull glow eyes of 
iceberg blue.
Icewrought Dracolich Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Religion check.
DC 20: When a white dragon grows close to 
death, it might seek the Heart of Absolute Winter, 
which is either a location or a ritual, depending on 
which tome or sage one consults. A full year later, 
an icewrought dracolich emerges in the midst of a 
howling winter storm. White dragons might do this 
because they have one or more clutches of eggs yet 

202
C H A P T E R  4  |  N e w  M o n s t e r s
unhatched, and at the end of their lives, they sud-
denly grow concerned about their progeny.
DC 25: An icewrought dracolich can call up the 
power of a blizzard, and its presence can strip away a 
creature’s cold resistance.
Icewrought Dracolich Tactics
An icewrought dracolich likes to pounce from close 
up on prey that failed to notice its icy form, camou-
flaged by snow. It uses frightful presence first and then 
spends an action point to unleash its breath weapon 
and trap as many targets as possible. Thereafter, it 
slashes with its claws at foes who are not yet trapped, 
trying to freeze them in place. It then uses deadly chill 
to destroy immobilized targets.
Dreambreath Dracolich
SOMETIMES A DRAGON INTERESTED IN PROLONGING
its existence discovers a way to forsake the physi-
cal limitations of animate bone and rotting wings. 
Dreambreath dracoliches have learned how to proj-
ect a permanent dream of themselves into the waking 
world, where they can stalk prey through both night-
mare and reality forever.
 
A pale white luminescence leaks from the trans-
lucent form of this skeletal dragon, and vapor swirls 
within its rib cage. Its wings stretch wider than seems 
possible, and across that blank black canvas the last 
remaining stars of a dying world sputter and wink.

Dreambreath Dracolich Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Religion check.
DC 30: A formless psychic realm exists that is 
called various things in different places but is most 
often known as Dream. Here dreams cavort, heedless 
of the waking world—but not always. Most fade into 
obscurity, but their echoes resonate forever through-
out Dream, giving rise to countless variations. The 
remnants of particularly vile dreams sometimes latch 
onto the dying wish of a dragon (possibly enabled 
through a ritual). From this union a dreambreath 
draco lich is born.
DC 35: A dreambreath dracolich can walk through 
the dreamscapes of living creatures, emerging to tor-
ment and kill. Those who move past such shallow 
entertainment seek to find the heart of Dream, where 
they believe the secrets of creation might yet lie.
Dreambreath Dracolich Tactics
A dreambreath dracolich surprises victims, approach-
ing with nightmare walk and then covering them with 
its sleep-inducing breath weapon. It then enters melee, 
spending an action point to use nightmare presence and 
then nightmare roar to drive away foes that have not 
succumbed to its initial attack. It then plays a game of 
cat and mouse, seeking to pounce on sleeping enemies 
while keeping active foes away.
 
If hard pressed, the dreambreath dracolich uses 
nightmare walk to slip away, rejoining the fight after its 
foes drop their guard. It hoards its final action point 
for a tactical retreat.
Encounter Groups
Bone mongrel dracoliches are encountered with 
other undead. Stoneborn dracoliches linger alone 
in desolate locations, but sometimes they gather 
lesser creatures to serve their ancient agendas. An 
icewrought dracolich is rarely found among other 
creatures, except when tribes of the ice offer it trib-
ute. However, icewrought dracoliches have a strange 
affinity for white wyrmlings. The coming of a dream-
breath dracolich is foretold in a dream. Dreambreath 
dracoliches ally with aberrant creatures or with 
beings that have similar powers over sleep.

DRACONIC WRAITH
A draconic wraith is the vilest portion of a dragon’s 
soul, which sometimes lingers beyond death. A com-
munity or an adventuring party might celebrate the 
death of an evil dragon—only to learn that the terror 
has not yet ended.

A character knows the following information with a

DC 25: A draconic wraith is the same sort of

essence of the Shadowfell.
 
DC 35: Draconic wraiths are either born from 
the Shadowfell or created by other draconic wraiths. 
Rarely does a humanoid wraith kill a dragon, and 
a wyrm so slain normally cannot rise as a wraith. 
Humanoids slain by draconic wraiths can, however, 
rise as wraiths themselves. Powerful rituals do exist

DRACONIC ZOMBIE
Soulgrinder Tactics
A soulgrinder attacks multiple targets with death’s 
maw, then spends an action point to blast its reeling 
enemies with its breath weapon to further strip their 
ability to recover. It continues to devastate foes with 
its melee attacks.
Encounter Groups
Draconic wraiths haunt Shadowfell-tainted areas, but 
they can also arise wherever a truly evil dragon has 
been slain. (In this sense, they are more like ghosts 
than wraiths.) Free-willed dracoliches of great power 
can learn to create draconic wraith servants.

DRACONIC ZOMBIE
Draconic zombies are ponderous masses of dead 
flesh and armored scales, nearly mindless but wholly 
malicious.
 
Draconic zombies arise under the same circum-
stances as skeletal dragons (see page 207), either as 
necromantic creations or as the result of the Shadow-
fell’s encroachment on the mortal world. Those 
without a master follow no instinct but to eat, and any 
living being they come across is food.
Draconic Zombie Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Religion check.
DC 25: A draconic zombie sometimes makes 
sounds, even the occasional recognizable word, but 
such noises are entirely meaningless. The mindless 
horror is incapable of intelligible communication.

TARA RUEPING
SKELETAL DRAGON
SKELETAL DRAGON
These nightmares of gaping sockets and flaking 
bones are far more than larger, fiercer versions of 
their humanoid counterparts. The innate magic 
of dragons remains infused in their bones. They 
retain enough native cunning, if not intelligence, to 
take advantage of terrain and surroundings during 
combat.
 
Skeletal dragons can arise from necromantic 
rituals or through the uncontrolled forces of the 
Shadowfell.
Skeletal Dragon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Religion check.
DC 25: Like other skeletons, skeletal dragons are 
incapable of meaningful vocalization. Dracoliches 
have been known to blend in with them, mimicking 
their silent and mindless gait to lure enemies into 
underestimating them.
DC 30: Only dracoliches and vampiric dragons 
regularly make use of skeletal dragons. Most drag-
ons, except for the truly evil or perverse, find their 
presence as disturbing as humanoids do humanoid 
skeletons. A necromancer of another race is more 
likely to create a skeletal dragon than is a dragon.
Razortalon
ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF A WARHORSE, this skeletal 
dragon has oversized claws and teeth, jagged wing 
bones, and twisted ribs. As it moves, it seems to 
become nothing but points and edges of yellowed 
bone.

Skeletal dragons serve either as guardians for great 
valuables and important sites, or as living weapons. 
Lacking a master, they are aware enough to act on

potential prey) until destroyed.

VAMPIRIC DRAGON
The most feared undead transcend human form. 
Dragon vampires hunt the night, too.
Vampiric Dragon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Religion check, as well as about vampires 
in general and vampire lords (MM 258). Everything 
true of vampire lords is also true of vampiric dragons, 
except when contradicted here.
DC 20: The only way to create a vampiric dragon 
is through the same dark ritual that creates a vampire 
lord. Sometimes, though, the victims of a vampiric 
dragon rise as spiritual undead such as ghosts and 
wraiths. Although that vampire has no direct con-
trol over such spawn, they are obedient and servile 
toward it.
DC 25: Vampiric dragons have no coffins. As long 
as they rest the necessary amount of time, the loca-
tion doesn’t matter.
Thief of Life
THE THIEF OF LIFE DRAINS ITS VICTIMS’ ESSENCE with

to one of the targets of its breath weapon, whether or not the 
attack hits.

advantage against, the target also takes ongoing 20 damage and 
is weakened (save ends both).

Bloodwind Tactics
The bloodwind begins combat by unleashing its 
breath weapon, then moves to the best tactical posi-
tion with breath leap (preferably gaining combat 
advantage). When it is attacked by a powerful enemy, 
it attempts to neutralize it with repelling gaze. Mean-
while, it lashes out with hunger frenzy against badly 
injured targets, using shadowy discorporation to main-
tain combat advantage.
Encounter Groups
Vampiric dragons, like living ones, prefer to lair 
alone. They keep their servants close—but not too
close. Still, wise vampires acknowledge their weak-
nesses and keep guards around them when they 
sleep.

This section presents a wide variety of monsters, all of 
which have some form of connection to dragonkind—
even though many of them are completely unlike 
dragons in how they look and how they act.
ABISHAI
DENIZENS OF TIAMAT’S FORTRESS IN TYTHERION, the 
Endless Night, abishais are an immortal race of 
devil like fiends that serve the Dark Lady of Dragons 
as messengers, guardians, tempters, and heralds. 
Whether encountered in Tytherion, the Nine Hells, 
or skulking through the shadows of the mortal world, 
they work to sow the seeds of avarice in preparation 
for the coming war between the forces of darkness 
and those of light.
 
Many abishai breeds exist, each differentiated 
by its association with a particular aspect of Tiamat 
and chromatic dragons, which is outwardly mani-
fested by the color of its scales and its personality. 
Although they vary in minor ways, all abishais have 
the same shape and general appearance. An abishai 
is a bipedal humanoid equipped with leathery wings 
and a long tail ending in a barbed stinger. A crown 
of horns emerges through the scaly skin of its brow, 
giving it a superficial resemblance to a gargoyle.

Abishai Lore
A character knows the following information with a

DC 15: Abishais are Tiamat’s immortal servants. 
They act as heralds, guardians, and occasionally 
spies. It’s believed that one abishai variety exists for 
each of Tiamat’s heads, though whispers of gray, 
purple, and others persist.
 
DC 20: Abishais use all sorts of underhanded tac-
tics to get an edge. No one trusts them, especially not 
other abishais.

Wrack Abishai Tactics
A wrack abishai begins an attack by blasting its 
opponents with acidic burst, then closes to deliver its 
vicious sting, using deadly ambush against a blinded 
target. Wrack abishais use hit-and-run tactics, darting 
out to attack blinded foes, and retreating as their ene-
mies recover. They turn invisible with shadow meld to 
use deadly ambush if unable to blind enemies.

An inferno abishai wades into the thick of battle, 
burning its foes as it lays about with its flaming sting 
and jagged claws. It uses binding flames to punish 
opponents that try to flee.
Encounter Groups
Wherever Tiamat has interests, abishais are bound 
to be nearby. These fiendish servants venture to the 
world, where they tempt mortals with promises of 
riches and offerings of service. Abishais are also 
common in the Nine Hells, working alongside the 
devils fighting among themselves or preparing for 
wars against others.

ABISHAIS IN HELL
Legions of devils are imprisoned within the cavern-realm 
of the Nine Hells, bound to the ruined dominion of the 
deity they rebelled against. The immortal race of devil-
like abishai are also found here, even though many of 
their kindred have escaped to Tytherion. Though many 
abishais who remain ultimately claim that their allegiance 
lies with the Dark Lady of Dragons, most encountered 
in Avernus, Dis, or other continents of Hell have more 
immediate commitments to see through. The Nine Hells 
are highly organized, and each devil has its place. Thus, 
abishais here serve devils who have not the least care 
for Tiamat. Many abishais in such roles serve as wardens 
and torturers, though a few might indeed secretly spy for 
Tiamat. If an abishai is discovered to have such a direct 
link to an external master, however, its devilish overlord 
makes short work of the traitor. Every devil has its place, 
and abishais that excel at the duties given them can be 
transformed into progressively more powerful forms 
through agonizing rituals.

Even dragons are not immune to parasitic infestation.
Hoard Scarab
HOARD SCARABS FEED OFF SCRAPS from the dragon’s 
meals and clean the wyrm’s teeth and scales. They 
instinctively recognize the dragon as their provider 
and never attack it, but they are quick to feast upon 
the flesh of any other living being.
 
A hoard scarab has a dull gold carapace, and when 
its wings are closed and its legs tucked in, it resem-
bles an oversized, malformed gold coin. The larvae 
are nearly impossible to tell apart from true coins—
until they attack as a metallic, chiming wave.
Hoard Scarab Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
DC 10: Hoard scarabs hide in the treasure of 
dragons and other powerful monsters, attacking any 
other creature that comes too close. Dragons might 
seed their hoards with the creatures deliberately, 
using them to weaken or distract would-be thieves.
 
Some sages believe that hoard scarabs were 
deliberately bred as a security measure, perhaps by 
dragons.
DC 15: By adulthood the wings of hoard scarabs 
become useless, but larvae are capable of limited 
flight.

Swarmtongue
SWARMTONGUES ARE REPULSIVE, wormlike creatures 
that feed on the flesh of the largest and most dan-
gerous monsters. They are instinctively drawn to 
dragons, whose elemental energy empowers them.
 
When it begins to feed, the beast stretches wide its 
horrific maw, disgorging a writhing, buzzing host of 
slime-covered grubs onto its prey. These are not sepa-
rate creatures, but extensions of the swarmtongue’s 
own digestive system that consume tiny portions of 
the prey’s flesh. After it has slain its prey, it reabsorbs 
the grubs, along with the nutrients—and elemental 
power—they have consumed.

DRACONIC PARASITE
DC 15:  Swarmtongue worms are deceptively 
large, as thick around a dwarf’s broad chest, and 
twice as long. Swarmtongue hydras are not related to 
true hydras but are so named for their two heads.
  DC 20: Swarmtongue hydras grow from swarm-
tongue worms, though not according to any fixed 
schedule.
DC 25: Sages speculate that swarmtongues 
resulted from an influx of Far Realm energy that 
bathed the body of a deceased dragon and warped 
the parasites feasting upon the corpse. A few suggest 
that the beasts are related to carrion crawlers.
DC 30: Swarmtongues’ attacks cause little pain, 
allowing them to feast upon sleeping prey. They 
attack waking creatures only out of hunger or in 
defense of territory.

SOME DRAGONBORN FIND TIAMAT’S ALLURE too pow-

they embrace the greed and jealousy common to all 
of Tiamat’s servants. They are a force of destruction

Dragonborn who serve Tiamat decorate their

DRAGONBORN
Dragonborn Annihilator Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Religion check.
 
DC 30: A dragonborn annihilator is the favored 
consort of Tiamat. Lover, general, and champion, 
he ventures into the world to punish those servants 
who failed the god. The annihilator’s sheer savagery 
inspires dread in dragons and dragonborn alike.
DC 35: The current consort, Kasarus, was once 
a champion of Tiamat, but he came to believe that 
neither she nor Bahamut was worthy of ruling drag-
ons. He journeyed to Tiamat’s lair to defeat her and 
steal her crown, but after long fighting he could not 
defeat her.
Exhausted and bleeding from innumerable inju-
ries, Kasarus knelt in surrender. Recognizing his 
valor, Tiamat took him on as her consort rather than 
destroying him.
Dragonborn Annihilator 
Tactics
An annihilator uses its conflagration breath, then 
flings itself into the thickest knot of foes, striking with 
sweeping assault, moving, and using an action point to 
strike again with dragonborn wrath. Against tougher 
opponents, the annihilator might instead focus on a 
single target. An enemy that dares to attack it must 
deal with its punishing strike, and all nearby foes 
are blasted with fury of the dragon if the annihilator 
becomes bloodied.
Encounter Groups
Deemed the choicest soldiers in Tiamat’s armies, 
dragonborn can be found among any cult or force 
that serves the Dark Lady. Some support dragon des-
pots, commanding lesser troops, while others claw 
their way up through the ranks to turn goblin and 
human armies toward the god they serve.

infusing them with the blood of other creatures. The

the Monster Manual to swell Tiamat’s armies.
Greenspawn Sneak
GREENSPAWN SNEAKS STAND JUST OVER 3 FEET TALL, 
with a thin, frail frame. What they lack in strength 
and physical power, they more than make up for in 
cunning and sheer numbers. Greenspawn sneaks 
are a staple of evil armies, finding work as scouts and 
spies.

Greenspawn Sneak Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
DC 15: Greenspawn sneaks live like beasts, con-
structing no societies of their own, but are capable of 
devious stratagems. They team up with hobgoblins, 
attracted to their discipline and fighting techniques.
Greenspawn Sneak Tactics
Greenspawn sneaks use terrain to their advantage, 
skulking through the trees to attack their enemies 
from unexpected directions before vanishing into 
the underbrush. A sneak typically starts a combat 
by lobbing a volley of acid spheres to weaken enemies 
and then uses hit-and-run tactics, taking advantage 
of terrain to outmaneuver foes and gain combat 
advantage.
Brownspawn Marauder
PRIMITIVE TRIBES OF BROWNSPAWN MARAUDERS roam 
the deep desert. When they emerge from the wastes, 
they linger about the fringes of civilization, trad-
ing stolen goods for food, water, and the occasional 
bauble that catches their eye. Most people regard 
them as little better than vermin, but the few who 
have survived forays into the deep wastes know that 
the marauders are heartless killers, given to robbing 
and murdering any traveler they meet.
 
A brownspawn marauder stands about as tall as a 
dwarf, hunched over, dragging its long arms on the 
ground. Its skin hangs loose on its body but tightens 
when it drinks its fill of water, as the fluid is stored in 
special pouches beneath its flesh. In areas of extreme 
heat, marauders unfurl impressive crests to radiate 
excess warmth.

DC 15: Brownspawn marauders gather in large 
tribal groups, roaming the wastes in search of plun-
der and prey. They strike against the same target 
repeatedly or creep into camps to steal precious water 
and vital gear.
Brownspawn Marauder Tactics
When a marauder attacks, it unleashes a sirocco 
strike at the closest foe. While its enemy is blinded, it 
charges forward, raking with bleeding slash. Against 
a superior force, it uses sand step to slip away. If the 
battle is going in its favor, it instead uses that power to 
gain an advantageous position.
Bluespawn Stormlizard
THIS FEARSOME BEAST IS KNOWN FOR ITS FEROCITY

DC 20: Bluespawn stormlizards are bestial crea-
tures driven by evil impulses. Many find service as 
steeds for dragonborn or other dragonspawn, but they 
have a reputation for turning on their riders at the 
slightest provocation. Riding a stormlizard can be as 
dangerous as fighting one.
Bluespawn Stormlizard Tactics
A bluespawn stormlizard begins with lightning charge
to knock its enemy to the ground, then presses the 
attack. It loses interest when its prey stops moving, 
turning its attention to another target. Stormlizards 
work well together, keeping close to one another and 
defending their packmates with counterbolts.

GREENSPAWN RAZORFIENDS ARE A MENACE to all

Grayspawn Fleshtearer
THE GRAYSPAWN FLESHTEARER IS A THROWBACK to the 
earliest efforts to fuse dragons with other creatures. 
The magical process was faulty, resulting in a twisted 
creature. Eruptions appear all over its body, and blis-
ters of acidic slime fill its mouth. These sacs of fluid 
regularly burst, making the fleshtearer’s existence 
one of constant misery.

and bear.

A grayspawn fleshtearer moves to attack the larg-
est and toughest opponent, marking it to keep it in

fleshtearer isn’t concerned about other threats but

Purplespawn Nightmare
PURPLESPAWN NIGHTMARES ARE GROTESQUE amal-

tor, keeping to the shadows until its target is fighting 
other creatures. Then it emerges, using nightmare 
form to confuse enemies before landing a devastating 
attack with its tail.
Redspawn Devastator
REDSPAWN DEVASTATORS ARE FURY INCARNATE, the 
most powerful bestial dragonspawn. Fortunately for 
the rest of the world, their numbers are small and 
their lairs remote. A devastator’s hunting ground is 
littered with scorched bones and sulfurous leavings.
 
A devastator is a mighty beast, nearly 15 feet long 
with a rippling, muscled body covered in crimson 
scales.

Redspawn Devastator Tactics
When a redspawn devastator detects another living 
creature, it surges forward, using its explosive charge. 
The devastator is not choosy about its target, attack-
ing any foe it can reach. If it takes any significant 
damage from its target, it tosses that opponent away 
to find easier fare. Injury only brings out the beast’s 
true savagery: Exploding with flames, it ignites its vic-
tims with flesh-eating fire as it rips them apart with 
its jagged fangs.

Encounter Groups
Bestial dragonspawn are exploited as warbeasts, 
mounts, or guardians. The more intelligent dragon-
spawn carve out their own destinies. They make 
alliances with other creatures to further their 
personal agendas or even seize control of tribes of 
weak-willed, savage creatures, bending such troops to 
their own cruel will.

Their reptilian appearance causes drakes to be mis-
takenly identified as small dragons. Although they 
are a separate breed, drakes possess special talents 
and abilities that make them favored companions of 
dragons and other reptilian creatures—or dreadful 
foes. The drakes presented below supplement those 
in the Monster Manual.
Ambush Drake
KNOWN FOR TERRORIZING PLAINS communities, 
ambush drakes gather in large packs that roam the 
wilderness in search of prey. Ambush drakes attack 
for food, but sometimes they act out of sheer malice. 
They are practically fearless, and have been known to 
attack large parties, caravans, and even fully armed 
expeditions.
 
A packleader is the most powerful ambush drake 
in a given group and can grow as large as a horse. 
Because a packleader earns its position only by kill-
ing the previous packleader, it bears the scars of 
numerous duels.
 
Ambush drakes do not speak, but packleaders 
understand Draconic.

Portal Drake
PORTAL DRAKES ARE OBSESSED WITH MAGIC. Their 
small size and strange appearance mislead others 
into underestimating these creatures. They are in 
fact accomplished arcanists and use their power even 
when not provoked.
 
About the size of a large housecat, a portal drake 
flutters about on gray wings, resembling a tiny,

Portal Drake Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
 
DC 15: Portal drakes haunt the Underdark, where 
they scour old ruins in search of interesting magical 
trinkets. They enjoy tormenting other creatures and 
specialize in leading prey to danger, such as into the 
lair of a purple dragon.
Portal Drake Tactics
A portal drake dislikes larger creatures and attacks 
those enemies first. Its cruelest tactic is to teleport 
foes over a pit or off the edge of a cliff. The portal 
drake uses slip through space to move its allies into 
better positions, to help an ally escape a foe, or to save 
its own hide.
Drake Encounters
Ambush drakes are too ornery and vicious for domes-
tication through normal means. Still, they respond to 
force and might serve a brutal captor—at least until 
they sense an opportunity to attack. Orcs are the 
most likely to break these creatures, though hobgob-
lin clans use them too.
 
If ambush drakes are unpleasant, portal drakes 
are downright monstrous. These vile creatures are 
treacherous to the extreme. They make alliances with 
other denizens of the Underdark, from mind flayers 
to drow, only to break them capriciously.

PORTAL BURST OR BUST?
The portal drake’s portal burst can be a lot of fun, but it 
can also be very deadly when used in conjunction with 
pits and ledges. When you are building and running 
encounters with these drakes, there are a few things 
to keep in mind. First, when building encounters, heed 
the advice in the “Precipitous Terrain” section on page 
44 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Second, if the portal 
drake teleports a creature over a precipice or a pit, but at 
least one side of the destination space has terrain that a 
creature could grab to catch itself (see “Falling,” Player’s 
Handbook, page 284), allow the creature the saving throw 
for going over the edge. In fact, when using this power, it’s 
almost always better to allow the PCs a chance to avoid 
the extreme effect of failure, so even if a portal drake 
could portal burst an enemy into a square that would offer 
no possibility of a saving throw, it might be better to pick 
a square that does, thus creating the possibility for a lit-
eral cliffhanger! This approach applies to more than just 
falling hazards. Although it is both clever and devious to 
design encounters in which a teleportation effect forces 
the PCs into a dire predicament, you should always give 
them a way out of those tight spots. The way out might 
not be optimal, and might not guarantee that the PCs 
will come out unscathed, but such hard knocks are the 
constant plight of the adventurer.

Kobolds are devious creatures whose natural cun-
ning and association with dragons give them a wide 
range of outlooks, objectives, and peculiarities. They 
are infamous for using traps to hamper, maim, and 
kill any who trespass in their lairs. 
Hobbler Kobold
ALL KOBOLDS USE TRAPS TO AN EXTENT, but the hob-
blers have elevated trap design to an art. These 
kobolds’ devices are not only innovative, but also 
especially cruel, humiliating victims as much as they 
hurt them.
 
A typical hobbler kobold bristles with an assort-
ment of tools, such as clamps, wrenches, and 
hammers, in loops and pouches of its stained leather 
apron. Hobblers also don dark goggles to protect 
their eyes, or complex spectacles fitted with dials and 
extra lenses to get a closer look at their traps’ inner 
workings.
Hobbler Kobold Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
DC 15: Hobbler kobold traps are among the most 
vicious and innovative in the world, whether used to 
maim, imprison, or kill. The kobolds that build these 
devices find employment with creatures other than 
dragons, especially those paranoid and heartless 
enough to appreciate their cruelty.
DC 15: Hobbler kobolds are so accustomed to 
working with traps that they have developed a special 
set of techniques to incorporate them into their fight-
ing tactics.

Wyrmwarped Kobold
KOBOLDS HOLD DRAGONS IN SPECIAL REVERENCE, a 
devotion that borders on outright worship. In the case 
of the kobolds known as wyrmwarped, this singu-
lar dedication is coupled with the caress of the Far 
Realm, resulting in horrific warping.
 
Wyrmwarped retain a hint of their kobold ances-
try, but rare are those with more than that. The 
corruption manifests in a ruin of flesh, glistening 
with open sores and covered with pustulent growths, 
twisted to resemble only vaguely the form of a 
dragon.
Wyrmwarped Kobold Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Dungeoneering check.
DC 15: In the depths of the Underdark, an old 
kobold tribe ended up serving a squamous spewer 
(page 231). Now these wyrmwarped kobolds roam 
the tunnels in search of fresh sacrifices for their hid-
eous master.
 
DC 25: The flesh and forms of these twisted 
creatures are as mutable as the shifting reality of the 
dread Otherwhere. So significant are their mutations 
that few survive the flesh-warping changes for long. 
Only the toughest of their numbers survive, but at a 
terrible price to their sanity.

FRANZ VOHWINKEL
Dragonkin Kobolds
THESE KOBOLDS TURN THEIR RACE’S NORMAL REVERENCE
of dragons into fanaticism. Driven to bind their souls to 
that of a dragon lord, dragonkin kobolds assume traits 
and qualities of their new master. The effects of this 
binding are not immediately apparent, but the kobolds 
undergo subtle changes in their appearance and stat-
ure and acquire unusual powers—at the cost of their 
independence and individuality.
 
Every dragonkin kobold bears a dragon scale on its 
chest that binds it to its master. The flesh around the 
scale rebels against this unnatural graft, becoming 
reddened and infected (though causing no discom-
fort). Dragonkin gain physical features of the dragons 
they serve, including a more scaly appearance than 
normal and strange, glowing eyes. They clothe their 
bodies in the shed scales of their masters, or even 
stitch them into their flesh, furthering the bond with 
the lord they gladly serve.
Dragonkin Kobold Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature check.
 
DC 25: Dragonkin protect the lairs and interests 
of dragons. The process of binding to a dragon master 
involves permanently fusing a dragon scale to the 
kobold’s chest, using the dragon’s blood to complete 
the ceremony. This ritual exacts a terrible price: It 
strips away all the participant’s ambitions and memo-
ries, replacing them with unwavering dedication to its 
master. The kobold becomes a mere extension of the 
dragon’s will.

Dragonkin Defender Tactics
Dragonkin defenders devote their lives to ensuring 
that no enemy reaches their master. Fighting in teams 
of two or three, they engage a single foe at a time; one 
uses none shall pass to weaken the target, and all focus 
their attacks on it until it is slain.

Pact-Bound Adept Tactics
Of all dragonkin, these kobolds have the closest con-
nection to their dragon masters. Their bond lets them 
channel their masters’ breath weapons. Pact-bound 
adepts don’t engage foes directly. They hang back 
behind sentries and defenders to strike from afar. If 
an enemy closes, the adept creates a fierce rebuke to 
drive it away.
Encounter Groups
Most dragons ignore kobolds, seeing them as vermin, 
but a few exploit the fanaticism and ingenuity of 
these creatures to defend their lairs.

CUSTOMIZING DRAGONKIN
The dragonkin kobolds presented here serve a red dragon 
master. To create other varieties of dragonkin, replace 
their powers’ fire keyword with a keyword appropriate 
to the chosen dragon’s breath weapon.

A POWERFUL DRAGON CAN PERFORM an ancient, secret 
ritual to grant a semblance of life to its own breath 
weapon. These creatures have crudely draconic shapes 
that crackle, roil, and billow with their constituent 
energy. Living breaths serve as guards, soldiers, and 
assassins for powerful dragons.
Living Breath Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Nature or Arcana check.
DC 20: Only dragons of great power can create 
a living breath. Living breaths cannot speak but are 
sentient and can understand Draconic.
DC 25: Certain kinds of living breaths are 
instructed to slay or at least severely weaken intrud-
ers. Others are created primarily to hold the dragon’s 
enemies at bay.
DC 30: In rare instances, a living breath has sur-
vived the death of its creator. It continues to exist in 
a near-mindless state, doing whatever it can to carry 
out its final orders.
DC 35: The dragon that created a living breath 
can shift its senses, so that the dragon sees and hears 
everything the living breath experiences. In addition, 
it instantly knows if the living breath is injured.

Burning Vortex Tactics
A burning vortex is a blazing disc spawned by an 
elder red dragon. It spins through the air, unleashing 
blasts of fiery wind that burn its foes and scatter them 
across the battlefield.
 
A clever red dragon commands its vortex follower 
to corral foes into a tight group and to prevent them 
from escaping. By forcing them into a bad position, 
the vortex enables a single blast of the dragon’s 
breath weapon to turn an entire party of adventurers 
into ash.

the target is dazed and takes a -2 penalty to charm attacks and

leave the space after it attacks, and must end its move in an 
unoccupied space.

The living breath of an ancient green dragon, a mind-
fire miasma manifests itself as a ravaging cyclone of 
poisonous gas roiling around the battlefield spread-
ing poison and death. 
 
Addicted to control, an ancient green dragon posi-
tions its mindfire miasma to slow and soften intended 
prey. Its master views it and uses it as a blocking 
pawn whose special poison augments its master’s 
already potent charm attacks. 
Encounter Groups
Dragons use living breaths in conjunction with other 
servants or with traps to cause maximum harm to 
those who would invade their homes.

FRANZ VOHWINKEL
SQUAMOUS THINGS ARE ABERRANT HYBRIDS of dragon-
flesh and madness run rampant. Sages guess they 
have a connection to gibbering beasts (Monster 
Manual, page 126), though squamous things are 
even more hideous and deadly. All agree that their 
mere existence is proof that the cosmos is not only 
incomprehensible to mortal minds, but also actively 
malicious.
 
A squamous thing is an amorphous mass of scales, 
mouths, fangs, and reptilian eyes. The creature’s mass 
roils with different colors and seemingly changes size 
and shape from moment to moment. The odor of the 
creature is a mix of brimstone and sweetness, musk 
and death. Its gaping mouths constantly issue thun-
dering roars.
Squamous Thing Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana check.
DC 15: Sometimes the madness of the Far Realm 
touches the world; where such contact occurs, real-
ity is stained. Lands where such a stain persists are 
sometimes referred to as cerebrotic blots, where 
madness holds sway. From them squamous things 
crawl forth, perhaps the spawn of dragons that 
maintained their lairs too close to the tainted land’s 
terrible core.
 
DC 20: Squamous things continually emit terrify-
ing roars, which terrify and confuse nearby creatures. 
Occasionally, one of these horrors utters an intel-
ligible word or phrase in Draconic or Far Speech, 
mingled with the insane roaring. The word or phrase 
could be a clue or warning, or it could be of no impor-
tance whatsoever.
 
DC 25: Squamous spitters roam widely, eating 
anything they can catch, though sometimes one 
remains in a location for months or even years before 
moving on. Squamous spewers are more likely to 
remain in one place, dwelling in ruined or subter-
ranean areas. Sometimes a spewer lingers near the 
cerebrotic blot that birthed it.
 
DC 30: The nature of squamous spewers draws 
lesser creatures to them, as if in worship. Although 
they appear insane, these horrors might serve a 
deeper malign purpose.

Squamous Thing Tactics
On its first turn a squamous thing unleashes its breath 
weapon: a horrifying spray of half-digested previ-
ous victims that renders the target half-mad. It then 
spends an action point to make a triple attack. In the 
following round, it spends another action point to use 
triple attack twice in a row. Its enemies, now reeling 
with ongoing psychic damage, are hampered by the 
creature’s frightful cacophony aura if they attempt to 
approach. A squamous thing uses far stare to respond 
to foes that attempt to flank it. It uses spew fangs 
against targets it can’t reach, but only when it has no 
other more effective tactics.
 
Squamous things are incomprehensible, but they 
are not foolish. They retreat when hard pressed, 
attempting to escape by burrowing.

Squamous maws are usually encountered as a duo, 
and the two attempt to corral prey between them. 
A maw begins combat with its horrifying breath 
weapon, then moves closer and spends an action 
point to make a double attack. The more creatures it 
can deal ongoing psychic damage to, the more it can 
affect with its mad hunger and dreadful cacophony.
Encounter Groups
Squamous things are loners, but lesser creatures 
occasionally accompany them, either as cult worship-
ers or opportunistic scavengers. The aberrants might 
tolerate such hangers-on for months before inevitably 
turning on them, consuming them for no apparent 
reason.

Over the history of the D&D game, a few great drag-
ons have become legends among adventurers. Noted 
for their cruelty, their unique powers, or their sheer 
indestructibility, such monsters have a level of fame 
that transcends worlds. This section details a few 
such famous dragons, as well as their dark god.
ASHARDALON
A TRADITIONAL SONG called The Coming of Ashard-
alon describes the depredations of this red dragon of 
immense power and self-importance. Ashardalon is 
well known for his tenacious clasp on life, no matter 
his injuries and setbacks. When he was struck a 
mortal blow, the dragon bound a demon into his 
breast as a second heart. But when that too threat-
ened to fail him, Ashardalon left the world to find the 
sustenance he required to live forever.
 
Ashardalon resembles an ancient red dragon in its 
prime, but certain odd features stand out. He has a 
demonic visage, and on his chest is a gruesome scar 
in the shape of a large winged humanoid—a balor. 
The dragon’s eyes are twin beams of burning fire, and 
tiny bolts of lightning constantly play between his 
claws and fangs.

Ashardalon Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana or History check.
DC 15: Ashardalon’s rampages brought sorrow 
and misery to the land. The red dragon was wor-
shiped by a cult that built a citadel for the great wyrm 
to serve as his lair. But foes sunk the dragon’s citadel 
to sunless depths beneath the earth, destroying the 
cult and dealing Ashardalon a mortal injury.
DC 20: Remnants of the cult survived this disas-
ter, and it reconstituted itself around a relic of its 
dragon liege: Ashardalon’s heart. With a magic born 
of equal parts skill, faith, and desperation, the cultists 
rekindled the heart—but not to life. The ritual infused 
it with the energy of the Shadowfell and transformed 
it, reborn in undead darkness, into the center of faith 
Dragon Hall of Fame
Dragon Hall of Fame
NIGHTFANG SPIRE
Some sages and adventurers are aware of Nightfang Spire, 
where the remnant of Ashardalon’s cult yet keeps its faith 
alive, worshiping the undead heart of Ashardalon. Stories 
paint a picture of a tower overrun by undead, former 
cultists that linger despite their dragon lord’s departure. 
The cultists are led by a vampire named Gulthias, whose 
single-minded dedication to the memory of Ashardalon 
keeps the residents of the tower—including the heart—
animate and instilled with a sense of purpose. Gulthias, 
growing more and more desperate, has initiated the mass 
sacrifice of nearby villages and cities to attract the atten-
tion of Ashardalon. No matter what atrocities Gulthias 
commits, though, Ashardalon is unlikely to return to his 
undead heart and his followers.

and necromantic power for the cult. The cultists 
hoped to call back Ashardalon, but the dragon never 
answered their summons.
DC 25: Ashardalon received a blow so griev-
ous that his heart was damaged beyond repair. The 
dragon, calling on all his craft and knowledge of 
ancient rituals, managed to replace his heart with a 
magically bound demon—no less than a balor, named 
Ammet. But so terrible was Ashardalon’s wound that 
even Ammet’s enchanted labor began to fail the drag-
on’s body. Ashardalon began to search for a source 
of life energy so pure that nothing could ever again 
threaten to kill him.
DC 30: Ashardalon’s lair is a mysterious domain 
in the Astral Sea called the Bastion of Unborn Souls. 
Claims that the Bastion is a font of preincarnate souls 
are derided as improbable. Still, the Bastion’s crystal-
line trees sprout soullike manifestations like brilliant 
points of light. When “ripe,” they fall from the trees 
and flow away, possibly to incarnate as living crea-
tures. Whatever the truth, each point of light is a 
source of life and energy to a creature that consumes 
it. Ashardalon has ensconced himself in the center 
of the Bastion, bathed in a stream of raw soulstuff 
to keep his faltering life steady. Like a boulder in a 
stream, the dragon’s body interrupts the flow, which 
beads across him like water.
DC 35: Creatures who stay within the confines 
of the Bastion of Unborn Souls do not noticeably 
age—the raw soulstuff keeps them young and vibrant. 
Ashardalon could conceivably live forever here. If 
indeed its points of light are preincarnate souls, crea-
tures of the world might be born as soulless husks, 
shambling vestiges of what they might otherwise be, 
and open to malign influence.
Tactics
Ashardalon flies into combat and releases his breath 
weapon, then spends an action point to use demonic 
fury. On the following round, he spends another 
action point to use dominating presence. Afterward, he 
continues to make melee attacks, unleashing an abys-
sal torrent whenever he gets the opportunity.
 
Ashardalon knows that if he is killed, the balor in 
his breast will have its freedom, so when he becomes 
bloodied, he warns his foes: “Fools! Kill me, and you 
release Ammet, Eater of Souls!”
Encounter Groups
Adventurers might encounter Gulthias and his min-
ions in Nightfang Spire or, if they are bold, confront 
Ashardalon in the Bastion.

Ashardalon was a creature of great fury and power even 
before he achieved his legendary status or gathered a cult 
following. Indeed, at least a century prior to the wound 
that ultimately paved the way for his demonic heart, he 
and his red dragon mate hunted a lush green land called 
the Golden Plain. The Golden Plain was ruled by a human 
king who dwelt in a many-towered fortress. As Ashard-
alon grew more reckless with his power, he came into 
direct conflict with the kingdom and its king. Thinking to 
show the dragon a monarch’s true might, the king sent 
a secret force of his knights to slay Ashardalon’s mate. 
Upon learning of his mate’s death, Ashardalon went on 
a rampage so fierce and so extended that the land itself 
finally buckled, pulling the king’s fortress beneath the 
ground. The once-lush region was renamed the Ashen 
Plain, and the fortress was rechristened the Sunless 
Citadel. In this sunken castle, Ashardalon’s first followers 
came to revere him.

OF ALL THE GREEN DRAGONS THAT HAVE EVER LIVED, 
few are as despised as Cyan Bloodbane. Gifted with 
a keen intellect and a knack for manipulation that 
far outstripped the cunning of his peers, he exploited 
his talents to advance his standing in the eyes of his 
dread mistress, Tiamat.
 
Cyan is exceptionally selfish, capable of any mali-
cious act to further his agenda and to improve his 
prestige with the Dark Lady. Above all, Cyan detests 
humanoids, seeing them as weak and unworthy. He 
takes special pleasure in tormenting elves, wrecking 
their minds with his filthy whispers.
 
Massive yet sleek, powerful but with slender limbs 
and a long, thin neck, Cyan Bloodbane has more 
in common physically with a mirage dragon than 
he does with a typical green dragon. His appear-
ance might lead an observer to think him sickly or 
weak—a mistake any individual makes only once. 
Cyan’s scales darken toward the middle of his back, 
giving way to light green and brown bands across 
his middle. He has no flared ridge, his head instead 
smooth and snakelike. Barbels hang like whiskers 
from his snout and chin, delicate sensory organs 
designed to help scent enemies and food. His eyes are 
black except in the presence of light, when they reveal 
a reddish hue that speaks to his wickedness.

Cyan Bloodbane Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana or History check.
 
DC 15: Though he is believed to be long dead, 
Cyan Bloodbane remains a dark presence in the 
minds and hearts of elves, evoking terror with the 
mere whisper of his name. Elves follow up on even 
sketchy rumors to ensure that their great enemy 
never returns to their lands.
 
DC 20: Cyan’s unsavory reputation stems from 
his part in the first movements of an old war between 
the forces of Tiamat and her longtime enemy Baha-
mut. He did not want to be involved in the brimming 
conflict but knew his reluctance would mean his 
destruction: If Tiamat won, she would punish those 
who failed her, and if Bahamut proved victorious, no 
place would be safe for chromatic dragons. Rather 
than endure the pain and agony of war, he sought 
other means to aid his queen.
 
DC 25: The opportunity Cyan sought was revealed 
when an old elf king, fearing that the conflict would 
spill into his ancient woodland nation, turned to an

THE ORIGIN OF CYAN 
BLOODBANE
Cyan Bloodbane is a major villain in the DRAGONLANCE®
novel Dragons of Winter Night. He unleashed the night-
mares of Lorac Caladon and nearly destroyed Krynn’s 
ancient elven nation of Silvanesti. Defeated by the Heroes 
of the Lance, Cyan Bloodbane escaped and continued as 
a force of evil and destruction until he was eventually 
brought down by Silvanesti arrows. 
 
Cyan remains the most well-known green dragon in 
the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. The information pre-
sented here allows you to insert this dragon into your 
campaign, regardless of setting.

SAM WOOD
CYAN BLOODBANE
artifact of great power: an Orb of Dragonkind. By using 
the Orb, he called on Cyan to attend the elf leader. 
Cyan could have killed the desperate elf, and in doing 
so could have weakened his people enough to make 
them vulnerable to attack, but the dragon had other 
plans.
DC 30: Cyan seduced the old king, whispering 
venomous advice backed by empty promises and 
false hopes. He offered to help the king protect his 
people and suggested that the lord unleash the magic 
of the artifact. In doing so, the elf king suffused his 
land with raw power and became a prisoner of the 
dragon’s poisonous lies. Cyan twisted the king’s mind, 
forcing him to shape the magic into his deepest fears 
and transform his ancient kingdom into a land of ter-
rifying nightmares.
DC 35: Before Cyan could complete his work, a 
group of heroes battled through the shades of the elf 
king’s fears and defeated him. The dragon escaped, 
though, and harbors a burning hatred for the heroes 
who beat him and for the elves who escaped his evil.
Tactics
Cyan epitomizes green dragon slyness, avoiding 
direct combat and favoring subterfuge and misdirec-
tion to mislead his foes by contaminating their minds. 
He approaches every battle with caution, though 
the prospect of killing elves might overcome such 
perspicacity.
 
When facing significant numbers, he uses his 
frightful presence to incapacitate and weaken lesser 
opponents and then luring glare to pull a soft target 
such as a controller or striker into bite 
range. He expends action points to hit 
foes with his breath weapon, and while its 
effect destroys their minds, he turns his 
attention to any who resisted the initial 
assault.
 As the combat unfolds, Cyan uses 
his breath weapon whenever he can 
and reserves his bite attacks for those 
he pulls into reach. If hard-pressed by 
defenders and leaders, he relies on night-
mares given form, awakening his enemies’ 
worst fears to erode their wills and 
weaken their resolve while he deals with 
the most dangerous. Cyan fights as long 
as he must, but he’s no fool; if the situa-
tion looks grim, he flies away to safety.
Encounter Groups
Cyan Bloodbane has no love for the 
contests between dragons and avoids 
confrontations with his kin. On occasion, 
he might ally with an archmage or a 
similar powerful mortal as long as it sup-
ports his own goals. Such arrangements 
rarely last for long—Cyan is a treacher-
ous creature who betrays an ally in an instant for a 
better bargain.
 
In recent years, Cyan has begun to attract follow-
ers, some who have found him and taken instructions 
directly from the green dragon, and others who know 
of Cyan only from stories but who wish to become 
associated with such a great power nonetheless. In 
most cases, green dragons are the nucleus of such 
groups.

IN THE SHADOW OF FABLED WHITE PLUME MOUNTAIN 
lies a dismal land, a blighted place of gnarled trees, 
bone fields, and roaming, hungry undead. The foul 
taint staining this region originates in the lair of 
a loathsome creature whose name inspires terror 
in even the boldest of heroes: Dragotha, the Death 
Dragon.
 
Little remains of Dragotha’s flesh to indicate that 
this undead horror was once a red dragon. Twin 
horns snake from the back of its skull; smaller ones 
are blackened by flame, cracked, splintered, or miss-
ing altogether, leaving dark holes that now hold only 
burrowing parasites. Tattered membranes clothe its 
wings while mummified tissue clings to its tail and 
massive rib cage. Webs hang from its frame while 
bright green maggots squirm in its joints. If the pres-
ence of this massive skeletal dragon were not enough, 
Dragotha’s baleful blue stare radiates all the malice 
and evil that fuels this undead monstrosity. To behold 
it is to see death.

Dragotha Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana or History check.
 
DC 15: Dragotha embodies the perfect fusion of 
dragon and undead,. Such is Dragotha’s reputation 
that this dracolich has acquired misguided cultists 
who erect shrines in the wreckage of its domain. 
Since the undead dragon rarely has use for living 
servants, these feckless acolytes receive the curse of 
undeath as their reward for constant service.
 
DC 20: Ages ago, Dragotha was a celebrated consort 
of Tiamat, a mighty red dragon chosen for his strength 
and cunning, as well as unswerving loyalty to his mis-
tress. He was dutiful and felt an earnest affection for 
the god, sparing him her wrath far longer than any 
other consort. For all the Dark Lady doted on Dragotha, 
though, he had little protection from ambitious drag-
ons that craved his vaunted position. Through his long 
years, he squared off against numerous dragon ascen-
dants, each more powerful than the last.
 
DC 25: Dragotha’s fall came when a vicious 
dragon challenged him. He dealt with the upstart as 
he had others, tearing out its throat and devouring 
its heart. Unknown to him, his rival was the son of 
Tiamat, whose death enraged his mistress. Realizing 
his doom was at hand, Dragotha fled Tiamat’s realm 
to find refuge in the mortal world. Even far from cruel 
talons of his former lover, he knew her servants would 
find him—and when they did, they would kill him.
 
DC 30: Dragotha sought out a powerful priest of 
the death god, a vile human named Kyuss, who prom-
ised immortality in exchange for the dragon’s service.

DRAGOTHA
Dragotha agreed, and not long afterward, Tiamat’s 
spawn descended on him and killed him. As the 
dragon lay, broken and dying, Kyuss made good on his 
vow. Instead of restoring him to life, however, Kyuss 
transformed Dragotha into a terrifying dracolich.
DC 35: After this final betrayal, Dragotha with-
drew to a hidden cave, contaminating the lands 
around. Hoarding treasures in the endless depths, 
the great monster rarely stirs these days. Rumor holds 
that the dracolich was drawn out of its lair once when 
adventurers breached the dungeons of White Plume 
Mountain, and again when Kyuss’s cultists sought to 
elevate the undead priest to godhood.
Tactics
Dragotha strikes quickly to maim and incapaci-
tate victims. At the first sign of intruders, it takes 
to the air, blasting its foes with its breath weapon. It 
then spends an action point to 
vomit death wind over the same 
enemies, followed by Dragotha’s 
curse against the least damaged 
striker to ensure that the agile 
adversary doesn’t slip past the 
dragon’s vicious fangs.
 In the next round, Dragotha 
recharges its breath weapon and 
spends its second action point 
to breathe again, all the while 
keeping in the air. Against foes 
that have dangerous ranged 
attacks, Dragotha descends and 
uses frightful presence to stun 
them, followed up by fury of 
tooth and claw. Over the follow-
ing rounds, Dragotha toys with 
its foes, using mesmerizing glare 
to set up attacks against those 
reckless enough to face it in melee, and Dragotha’s 
contempt to worry those too craven to close. Against 
powerful foes, Dragotha might reserve an action 
point to aid escape, but overconfidence is the one 
weakness of this dracolich.
Encounter Groups
The entrance to Dragotha’s lair is rarely used, being 
overgrown by tough brambles and crawling with 
ghouls, wights, and worse. Beyond this narrow 
entrance lies an enormous dungeon descending miles 
into the earth, home to hideous aberrant creatures 
and legions of undead. Navigating these tunnels is as 
perilous as facing the Death Dragon.
Level 32 Encounter (XP 143,000)
✦ Dragotha (level 31 solo controller)
✦ 4 dread wraiths (level 25 lurker, MM 267)
As powerful as Dragotha is, its most hated enemies are 
even more so. If there are two beings in the world—nay, all 
the worlds—whom Dragotha can be said to despise above 
all others, they would be Tiamat, the Queen of Dragons, 
and Kyuss, the Worm That Walks. The former is a goddess; 
the latter an undead priest of horrific might, not a god yet 
but very nearly as potent. Both granted Dragotha great 
power, great authority—and both ultimately betrayed him, 
leading him to his current, abhorrent state.
 
Many of Dragotha’s current schemes are devoted to 
wreaking horrible vengeance upon those who turned on 
him—and yet the undead dragon is nothing if not cunning 
and oh, so patient. At times the dracolich has masquer-
aded as a loyal servant to both entities, most recently 
taking part in a convoluted scheme intended to grant 
Kyuss true godhood. Though it led the Worm that Walks 
to believe that its service was genuine, Dragotha sought 
only to grow close enough to Kyuss to slay the vile priest. 
It hopes for the opportunity to commit deicide against 
Tiamat as well, though it is unsure how. Some sages specu-
late that it seeks to usurp her place as a god of dragons, 
but Dragotha—though ambitious—currently shows no signs 
of any such objective. Lately, Dragotha has contemplated 
turning the followers of Tiamat and Kyuss against each 
other, but as yet hasn’t come up with a viable way of going 
about it.
 
Because of this burning hatred it holds for two beings 
of ultimate evil, Dragotha could potentially wind up allied 
even with good-aligned PCs, if their objectives overlap with 
its own. Anyone who proves worthy, and demonstrates the 
willingness to take on either the worshipers of Tiamat or 
the mad cults of Kyuss, attracts Dragotha’s interest.

DEEP IN THE SWAMPS OF A MARSHY ISTHMUS the size 
of a small continent, a self-proclaimed god who calls 
herself the Lizard Queen demands worship from the 
native lizardfolk and tribute from all others.
 
This ponderous beast is unlike any black dragon 
known to adventurers or sages. Others of her kind 
are sinuous and slender, with low-slung bodies, but 
Gulgol is a massive, corpulent creature. Leathery 
flesh bulges between scales that never grew suffi-
ciently to cover her astonishing bulk. It hangs in rolls 
from her tail, from her neck, and beneath her squint-
ing, porcine eyes. She breathes heavily with exertion, 
her legs bent beneath her heavy body, and her voice is 
a deep rasp punctuated by sharp inhalations.
 
Do not mistake her corpulence and pumping 
breath for a sign of weakness, or assume that her 
inherent laziness makes her an easy target. Those 
who do rarely survive to appreciate the magnitude of 
their error.

Gulgol Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana or History check.
DC 15: Gulgol is a great black dragon that dwells 
in the depths of the Fenreach. Gulgol has dwelt in the 
swamp for several centuries. She eventually grew to 
dominance over the rest of her clutch, and rumor has 
it she consumed her siblings.
DC 20: The swamp’s lizardfolk and other tribes 
consider Gulgol a god, serving her fanatically. Com-
munities of the swamp must send her tribute or be 
raided by her followers, and travelers who grow lost 
in the Fenreach must choose whether to be enslaved 
or eaten, unless they are rich enough to buy their 
freedom. She insists on being addressed as “Queen 
Gulgol” or “Your Majesty.” Anything less is an insult, 
and those who offend Gulgol become her next meal.
DC 25: Gulgol’s zealous followers include a coven 
of bog hags—named Zunuris, Ilbotha, and Shenvush—
and their servitor trolls; a tribe of savage humans and 
their clutch of semitrained fen hydras; and a tribe of 
blackscale lizardfolk whose name translates loosely 
GULGOL
GULGOL
THE FENREACH
The distant Fenreach is an isthmus that connects two 
great landmasses. It is nearly the size of a small continent 
and is covered by deep swamp and marshy forest. Several 
rivers run through it, allowing merchant vessels to travel 
across the Fenreach rather than circumnavigating the 
continents, but these waterways are tricky, hidden, and 
impassable without the services of native guides whose 
services do not come cheap. The humanoid inhabitants of 
the Fenreach dwell in small villages built on hummocks, 
or in trading stations constructed in the wrecks of ships. 
 
Life here is hard: sweltering, vermin-ridden, water-
logged, and beset by hunger and plague. Further, the 
people here must deal constantly with lizardfolk, yuan-
ti, hideous reptiles, and even undead. And worse than 
them all, spoken of only in hushed whispers and bedtime 
tales meant to frighten children, is Queen Gulgol, self-
proclaimed god of the swamp and all who dwell within.

RICK SARDINHA
GULGOL
as “Broken Fang Tears Violently.” Her vizier is a 
guardian naga named Alhashna, and her other three 
closest advisors are a trio of yuan-ti malison incanters 
who believe Gulgol to be favored by the serpent-god 
Zehir.
DC 30: Gulgol is known as lazy and gluttonous, 
not only to those who have studied her but to other 
dragons as well. She is amazingly obese for a dragon 
and refuses to expend any unnecessary effort; her 
worshipers’ duties include delivering all her meals 
and comforts. She is less agile than other black drag-
ons but is nevertheless powerful, and she can exert 
herself if need be.
DC 35: Through centuries of practice and the 
study of draconic magic, the Lizard Queen has 
altered her innate abilities. She has acquired the 
power to force a measure of obedience from all 
around her.
Tactics
Gulgol is a straightforward combat-
ant, eschewing stealth for brute 
force. She normally begins with 
frightful presence—she loves watch-
ing others cower. She spends an 
action point to use either her breath 
weapon or fog of obedience, depend-
ing on how many melee combatants 
are near her. Although she can use 
fog of obedience more than once per 
combat, she rarely bothers to do so, 
preferring tactics that deal more 
damage. She favors tearing into foes 
with her teeth and claws over using 
vitriolic spray, though she resorts to 
the latter at need.
Encounter 
Groups
Encounters with Gulgol take place 
in her court: a cave in the side of an 
overgrown and mossy hill that overlooks a bowl-shaped 
depression in the swamp. Even if adventurers manage 
to find the spot, they must either fight or talk their way 
through an army of blackscale lizardfolk and a hydra 
guardian, plus at least one of the yuan-ti. Even if Gulgol 
deigns to grant an audience, she does not allow outsid-
ers into her cave, but heaves her great bulk out to the 
opening, looking down upon petitioners in the hollow.
Level 22 Encounter (XP 23,000)
✦ Gulgol (level 20 solo brute)
✦  Alhashna, guardian naga (level 12 elite artillery, 
MM 194)
✦ 2 blackscale bruisers (level 6 elite brute, MM 179)
✦ 1 fen hydra (level 12 solo brute, MM 164)
✦  3 yuan-ti malison incanters (level 15 artillery, 
MM 269)
Although most of Gulgol’s “court,” and many of her follow-
ers, consider her to be royalty, a large portion of the more 
primitive tribes that serve her treat her as a true goddess. 
She is not just a secular leader to them but a truly divine 
entity, to whom they direct the entirety of their worship 
and their sacrifices—both treasure and living beings.
 
The bulk of these worshipers are lizardfolk from the 
various tribes of the Fenreach, but they also include a fair 
number of kobolds, trolls, hags, and yuan-ti.
 
Gulgol’s high priest is a truly vile entity by the name of 
Anachthul. A yuan-ti malison incanter (Monster Manual 269) 
with the demagogue template (Dungeon Master’s Guide
178), Anachthul and his yuan-ti and hag underpriests rule 
utterly over Gulgol’s worshipers. Those who pay homage 
to the Lizard Queen are willing to die—and, far more fre-
quently, to kill—at Anachthul’s slightest word.
 
What none other than Gulgol and Anachthul know is 
that the yuan-ti cult leader is fully aware that his mistress 
is not a god at all. Yet he pretends to such belief, and 
leads others in it, as a means of keeping control over the 
more primitive members of Gulgol’s followers. So com-
pletely has he swayed their beliefs that some among the 
lizardfolk and hags have even been ordained as clerics of 
the Lizard Queen, and their faith is strong enough that 
they have the same sort of divine ability as the clerics of 
“real” gods.

DRY WINDS AND HOT SAND SWEEP ACROSS a once-
fertile land. Prehistoric ruins and mighty monuments 
emerge from the desert like the grasping fingers of 
a buried corpse. Here, in what had been one of the 
greatest draconic empires of the past, an ancient 
emperor and the last of his line refuse to let go.
 
Nefermandias, often referred to as the Forsaken 
Pharaoh, is an enormous, writhing wyrm of ancient 
knowledge and boundless rage. He is longer and 
larger than other ancient brown dragons, but his 
great age wears on him. His torso and limbs have 
grown gaunt, his eyes locked in a perpetual squint. 
His scales have faded to a dull and dirty yellow, and 
he carries with him the odors of baking sand and 
lingering death. Yet Nefermandias is driven by a 
will older than mortals can imagine, and a wrath-
ful frustration as unquenchable as the sun. Though 
impossibly old, he is one of the mightiest dragons that 
still draws breath.

NEFERMANDIAS
A character knows the following information with a suc-
cessful DC 25 History or Nature check.
 
Located in an immense valley of lush rivers and fertile 
fields, this ancient nation boasted rich agriculture, great 
wealth, and unsurpassed military might. It thrived in the 
days before the rise of human culture, before the tiefling 
empire of Bael Turath or the dragonborn nation of Arkho-
sia. In Maru-Qet, ordinary humanoids were subservient 
to dragonspawn, dragonspawn to chromatic dragons, and 
dragons to the great Qetian Dynasties. These pure blood-
lines of brown dragons ruled as pharaohs and as demigods, 
exarchs of Tiamat, for a thousand centuries.
 
Then it ended. The last pharaoh of Maru-Qet, unshak-
able in his arrogance, chose to wage war with a growing 
clan of catastrophic dragons that dwelled in nearby lands. 
He lost.
 
Today, Maru-Qet is a vast desert, desolate except for 
sporadic oases and a few militant city-states that yet linger 
in the wastes. These communities, and a few nomadic 
tribes, are all that remain of the brown dragons’ kingdom—
yet the Forsaken Pharaoh and his offspring, last of the great 
Qetian Dynasties, rule here still.

NEFERMANDIAS
Nefermandias Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana or History check.
DC 20: The last ruler of the draconic nation of 
Maru-Qet was a great brown dragon called Nefer-
mandias. He is called the Forsaken Pharaoh, for he 
reigned even as his nation was torn asunder, and 
some believe he lives still.
DC 25: Nefermandias indeed lives, ruling a clutch 
of offspring and devoted servants that, in turn, lord it 
over the few remaining city-states and tribes of what 
was once grand Maru-Qet. Desperate to restore his 
kingdom to its former glory, Nefermandias attempts 
to enslave any humanoid creatures who draw near. 
Slaves of the Forsaken Pharaoh can expect short, 
miserable lives; in his frustration, Nefermandias has 
grown cruel and vicious.
DC 30: Although it is a brutal wasteland, and 
those who survive its dangers might wind up as slaves 
or worse, Maru-Qet is also a land of forgotten trea-
sures and ancient secrets that even Ioun or Vecna 
might covet. Nefermandias and his brood hold many 
of these, but others still remain hidden in the ruins or 
buried beneath the desert sands.
DC 35: Nefermandias and his offspring dwell in 
great pyramidal tombs, intended to serve as their 
homes both before and after death. These complexes 
are filled with traps of lethal power and intricacy.
Tactics
The draconic pharaoh uses his breath weapon and 
horrid wilting from a safe distance, blinding his 
enemies and draining the moisture from their flesh. 
The swirling barriers of his wall of sand and sandstorm
powers control the battlefield and keep foes at a dis-
tance. If foes manage to close, he stuns them with 
frightful presence, then spends an action point to move 
out of melee range. He reserves his majestic presence
for protection while retreating or to support his allies 
when not fighting alone.
Blades of the 
Pharaoh
At the height of his reign over Maru-
Qet, Nefermandias created these 
entities to serve as soldiers and tomb 
guardians. With humanoid bodies 
but draconic heads to match the 
pharaoh’s own, these constructs are 
made of sandstone frames wrapped 
in desiccated human flesh, with 
castoff brown dragon scales laid 
over all. These were once among the 
region’s mightiest soldiers, and they 
are still quite dangerous, but the 
ages have taken their toll; the blades 
of the pharaoh have crumbled, their insides made up 
not of stone anymore but merely sand, and the pha-
raoh has either forgotten how to create them anew, or 
hasn’t felt the need to bother.

INHABITANTS OF THE FAR-FLUNG NORTH fear winter for 
more than its freezing temperatures and the hard-
ships the ice and snow bring. Something far darker, 
far deadlier than such simple troubles plagues these 
hardy folk. As the first freeze descends across the 
lands, a great beast of winter stirs. Called Rime, this 
ancient white dragon embodies the fury of fierce 
winter storms and the gnawing pain of frostbite. The 
reign of terror lasts throughout the cold season: Travel 
grinds to a halt, and residents hole up in their cellars 
to wait out the death that flies by night.
 
Rime is a magnificent specimen of her kind. Tiny 
spines beneath her triangular crest and spreading out 
from her joints superficially resemble hair, but they are 
sharp and jagged, perfect for catching and tearing flesh. 
Thick white plating protects her spine, from her crest 
to the tip of her tail. Her most curious feature is the 
mithral plating bolted onto the thick scales protecting 
her skull and breastbone. These plates are scored and 
scratched, testifying to both great age and hard use.

Rime Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana or History check.
 
DC 15: Rime has plagued the north for over a cen-
tury, far longer than the lifetime of anyone in those 
isolated communities. A few adventuring groups have 
come to fight the dragon, but all have vanished, with 
only crimson snow or a shattered sword trapped in 
ice to mark their fate. One group set out to find the 
dragon’s lair during the spring thaw. A single hero 
returned, but frostburn had stolen all his fingers, his 
nose, and his ears. He died soon after, succumbing to 
feverish nightmares and moaning of ice demons, lost 
citadels, and the constant cold.
 
DC 20: Theories of the dragon’s origin are dis-
missed as romantic tales or as gruesome ghost stories 
to keep folk vigilant. The oldest dwellers of the north 
might recall a bit of legend about the time before 
Rime’s appearance, when the Empire of Nerath still 
stood strong and its greatest knights rode dragons 
into battle.
 
DC 25: Rime was such a steed. Formerly known 
as Auslief, she was a companion to a great hero 
known for his courage and ferocity in battle. Before 
the gnoll uprising that spelled the doom of old 
Nerath, the pair chased a vile demonologist into the 
frozen wastes, following him and his cultists across 
glaciers, up frozen mountains, to the fringes of the 
distant polar regions where great wintry beasts 
prowled the night. They cornered the villain in a for-
gotten fortress, where they fought desperately against 
suicidal cultists, ice demons, and other wicked 
monsters.
 
DC 30: The battle lasted for ten days, but in the 
end the knight perished, torn to pieces by savage 
demons. After he fell, Rime fled the horrors of the 
crumbling citadel. The dragon’s flight did not take 
her far, though, since her training included fitting her 
with mithral plates imbued with magic to make her 
obedient to her rider. She struggled to escape, but the 
plates forced the dragon down, where she lay exposed 
until she gained the strength to crawl back to where 
her master lay.

MIGUEL COIMBRA
RIME
DC 35: Many years have passed since the death 
of the ancient knight, yet Rime remains bound to his 
corpse by the accursed mithral fused to her body. The 
magic that brings the dragon back to the knight has 
waned enough that when winter falls, Rime has the 
strength to fly away, hunt, and be free. Each spring, 
though, the magic draws her back. Rime laments her 
fate but, so far, has been powerless to escape it.
Tactics
When Rime emerges from her icy lair, she takes 
to the skies in search of prey—hapless peasants, 
mammoths, or adventurers. Wherever she goes, 
winter follows, moisture in the air crystallizing into 
ice and snow. Upon spotting a suitable meal, she 
descends until it is in range of her breath weapon, then 
unleashes a torrent of liquid ice. She then drops to the 
ground and uses her bite and claws to rip the prey to 
pieces.
 
When her enemies begin to recover, she whips 
up a blizzard, blanketing the area in thick snow and 
encasing her victims in ice. She directs her attacks at 
restrained targets before turning to any opponents 
still on their feet. Rime spends an action point for an 
additional use of Rime’s fury, but she keeps her other 
action point in reserve in case she starts to lose. If the 
unthinkable happens and she becomes bloodied, she 
recharges her breath weapon, breathes again, and then 
spends an action point to use frightful presence.
Sons of Winter
Descending from those ancient cultists whom Rime 
fought at the wintry citadel, the sons of winter are a

Rime is encountered outside her lair only in the 
winter months. For the rest of the year, she dwells in 
the ruined fortress, by the long-rotted remains of the 
knight who bound her. Descendants of the demon-
worshipers she and her knight once pursued have 
survived here as well. An uneasy truce holds over the 
place: The cultists depend on the dragon to protect 
their home-in-exile and keep away those who would 
kill them for their unspeakable practices. (You can 
use the templates in Chapter 10 of the Dungeon Mas-

TIAMAT IS THE EVIL GOD OF WEALTH, greed, and envy. 
She is the patron of chromatic dragons and those 
whose lust for wealth overrides any other goal or con-
cern. Tiamat has five heads, each the shape and hue 
of that of a different chromatic dragon. Perhaps five 
minds drove her to madness, because Tiamat is bitter 
and wicked. Her story is a topic of art, myth, and 
legend throughout the cosmos. 
 
A nightmarish synthesis of hatred, rage and 
draconic might is embodied in the huge form of a 
five-headed dragon. The dragon’s sinuous body is 
powerful and thickly scaled, the color of dark wine or 
dried blood. Her long tail ends in a scorpion’s venom-
ous barb.
Tiamat Lore
A character knows the following information with a 
successful Arcana or Religion check.
DC 15: Tiamat is an evil god of wealth, greed, and 
envy. She urges her followers to hoard wealth and to 
take vengeance for every slight, and she is the patron 
of chromatic dragons. She is the divine example of 
the principle that might makes right, and that crea-
tures should take what they desire from others; those 
who lack the strength to defend their possessions are 
not worthy to own them.
DC 20: All evil dragons, whether chromatic or 
otherwise, pay homage to Tiamat. Creatures other 
than dragons also worship Tiamat, appreciating the 
power of greed and the strength of pitiless action. It 
is said that the members of a secret order of bankers 
in one of the largest cities in the world have Tiamat’s 
symbol inked on their flesh.
DC 25: Tiamat is rumored to have more than 
one form, including lesser versions of her full divine 
might. These aspects might appear as powerful ver-
sions of her chromatic children or as versions of her 
own five-headed form. The Chromatic Dragon is also 
rumored to be able to take the form of a humanoid, 
most often a dark-haired female mage.
 
DC 30: Tiamat lives in a domain on the Astral 
Sea called Tytherion, the Endless Night. The Endless 
Night is a place of gloom and lightless terror and is 
strongly influenced by the Shadowfell. Serpents and 
dragons haunt its otherworldly wilderness.
 
DC 35: The fortress of the Chromatic Dragon is a 
jagged, crown-shaped mountain redoubt. Five watch-
towers, each carved to resemble the head and neck of 
a watchful dragon, curve up and out from the main 
structure. Because the fortress’s primary entrance 
is through its roof, it is accessible only to flying crea-
tures, such as the abishais, dragonborn, dragons, and 
other servitors that reside within. The secondary 
entrance is a cave in the sheer rock wall abutting a 
location called the Maggot Pit.
 
The fortress is at least two or three times larger 
within than its external appearance would suggest. Its 
upper floors resemble a sumptuously appointed royal 
castle, scaled to accommodate a dragon of Tiamat’s 
immense size. Beneath it are miles of winding corri-
dors and treasure caverns. Each treasure chamber in 
the fortress is guarded by a jealous chromatic dragon.
 
DC 40: Tiamat enjoys the company of consorts, 
powerful mortal dragons that distinguish themselves 
in one way or another. Her consorts are usually chro-
matic, but she has been known to court catastrophic, 
metallic, planar, and scourge dragons. Famous past 
consorts include Ephelomon and the now-undead 
Dragotha (page 236). The number of Tiamat’s cur-
rent consorts is unknown but might exceed five. One 
is not a dragon at all but a dragonborn annihilator 
(page 216) named Kasarus.
Tactics
Because Tiamat can act multiple times in a round 
and has so many action points, her tactical options 
TIAMAT
TIAMAT
“Deity” is a special designation reserved for creatures that 
are truly godlike. Put simply, deities break the rules. 
✦  Deities always roll saving throws in response to an 
attack or effect that imposes a condition or deals ongo-
ing damage, even if that effect normally does not allow 
a saving throw. 
✦  A deity is an epic threat. It cannot be attacked by crea-
tures or characters whose level is lower than 20th. It 
is literally beyond their capability to affect. 
✦  Deities know Supernal, which allows them to speak 
and understand all languages.
✦  A deity is normally defeated when reduced to its 
bloodied value, but is not killed. Instead, the deity is 
discorporated: Its essence escapes, and it is unable 
to assume physical form for a time. The specifics are 
set by the DM, but discorporation lasts at least for 
several months, and up to three years. The deity is 
weaker during this time, but it is far from gone. If PCs 
wish to truly kill a deity, they must fulfill one or more 
conditions specific to that deity. This could require 
destroying the deity’s most prominent temple, magi-
cally separating the deity’s realm from the rest of 
creation, or finding an artifact that can deliver the 
killing blow. If the specific conditions are satisfied, 
the deity cannot discorporate and instead becomes 
bloodied as normal.

TIAMAT
are numerous. She can change her tactics even in the 
middle of a round. However, she is likely to take cer-
tain actions if facing a credible threat.
 
At the beginning of combat, Tiamat takes to the 
air if not already flying and uses frightful majesty. She 
then spends an action point to use her black head’s 
breath weapon. On each of her turns, she uses one or 
two breath weapons, trying to exhaust all of them so 
she can unleash her chromatic breath in the follow-
ing round. Tiamat is wily enough to retain at least 2 
action points in case she needs to retreat in the face of 
a force strong enough to overwhelm a god.
 
When her chromatic breath becomes active, she 
uses it whenever it recharges, relying on her various 
melee attacks in the meantime (landing if neces-
sary to move into reach). Opponents who remain 
too long in her aura are not only subject to a barrage 
of damage, but also special effects from the various 
heads’ attacks. Tiamat also likes turning one or more 
foes against each other with her tail sting.

DESTROYING TIAMAT
Only by meeting specific conditions can the characters 
hope to kill Tiamat. The following are sample quests.
Appeal to Avarice: An ancient treasure was lost in the 
Astral Sea while being transported in a githyanki ship. If 
the PCs can locate this cache of immaculate gems and 
rare metals, they can use Tiamat’s greed to draw her out 
of her domain. They must trick her into entering a domain 
under the control of Bahamut, where she can be slain, or 
at least her discorporated essence can be trapped.
Draconic Weapons: The PCs must kill five ancient 
dragons, each of a different chromatic variety, then craft 
magic items from their bones or scales. Only if they are 
wearing or using these items can they destroy Tiamat. At 
least one of the ancient dragons killed for this purpose 
must be a past or present consort of Tiamat.
Gather Tiamat’s Eggs: One hoary old tome printed on 
basalt pages and bound in purple dragon scales describes 
a ritual called Fashioning Tiamat’s True Death. This ritual’s 
intricate recipe includes procuring at least one of Tiamat’s 
eggs, in which a newly forged weapon must be quenched. 
Multiple weapons require multiple eggs. If the weapon is 
used against Tiamat and draws blood at least once, the 
god’s essence is destroyed, not discorporated.

Tactics
Tiamat’s aspect is a brutish reflection of her powers. 
It is still intelligent, though, and makes the most of 
its tactical options. It starts with a blast of chromatic 
breath and spends an action point to follow up with 
Tiamat’s fury. If enemies are still a threat, it uses fright-
ful majesty to lock them down and then lashes at them 
again, teleporting around the battlefield for maxi-
mum advantage. A troublesome defender is a typical 
target for its tail sting. The aspect continues fighting 
until destroyed.
The Poison Fist
Despite Tiamat’s preference for dragons and draconic 
servitors, many of her most potent and most favored 
operatives are other humanoids. Priests and cult 
leaders of every race exhort her followers in religious 
ceremonies, and a number of humans, elves, goblins, 
and kobolds act in her name.
 
Among the most infamous of these is a figure 
known far and wide only as “the Poison Fist.” A 
human assassin named Madras Kalgore, he was 
once a young priest of Sehanine, who sacrificed 
his loyalty to that goddess in exchange for unholy 
powers offered to him by a dragon cleric of Tiamat. 
The dragon-queen’s priests use Madras as an assas-
sin or a spy—often alone, occasionally with others—in 
situations when they wish to keep the church’s 
involvement secret.
 
In Eberron, Kalgore is perhaps the most potent 
assassin of the great cult known as the Talons of 
Tiamat, the largest cult of Tiamat in that setting.

THE MAGGOT PIT
The Maggot Pit is a 1,000-foot-wide crater that can 
capture the souls of dying or dead creatures that would 
otherwise flash to the Shadowfell and from there, their 
final fate. Filled with ooze and writhing white worms, 
this mammoth chasm radiates a palpable sense of evil 
and corruption.
 
Abishais and other servitors of Tiamat send a constant 
stream of screaming, terrified prisoners over the edge of 
the pit, prodding them to a long fall that ends in drowning 
and being devoured by the maggots. Each captured soul 
is encased in the rancid excretions of the white worms, 
which coalesce into a gelatinous new shell called a lemure. 
Creating these obscene manifestations of souls held back 
from their true destiny is considered one of the foulest pos-
sible acts. Tiamat regards the Maggot Pit and the lemures 
it produces as another of her favorite treasures.

IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE WARS between Arkhosia 
and Bael Turath, a traitorous dragon rang the death 
knell. This vile beast is known as the Gray Worm. 
Through his treachery, the dragons and dragonborn 
of Arkhosia perished alongside the infernal empire 
of the tieflings, bringing ruin to both mighty nations 
and closing the chapter on their glorious and villain-
ous histories.
 
The Gray Worm is an ancient gray dragon of 
immense size, but he is a shadow of his former might. 
For his part in the fall of Arkhosia, he was beaten, 
torn, and brought to the brink of death by his kin. 
He carries the scars still, suffering terribly from 
their vicious blows. The thorns and spikes bristling 
his body are broken and splintered. The gray plates 
protecting his hide are pale, almost translucent, and 
some are missing where the flesh of old injuries knit-
ted imperfectly. An eye is missing, and half his teeth 
have rotted away. 
 
Zebukiel appears to be a dragon near the end 
of his days. But he is cursed, unable to die until he 
is brutally slain, as were his people at the hands of 
heartless tieflings and their infernal allies.

Zebukiel Lore
A character knows this information with a successful 
Arcana or History check.
 
DC 15: Shunned and despised by all dragonkind, 
Zebukiel has spent his wretched life on the wing, 
avoiding those who might remember his name and 
fleeing the justice he so richly deserves. Cursed never 
to die from accident or age, he knows that the only 
death that awaits him is through combat. Ever the 
craven, he does not want to face such an end.
 
DC 20: Before his fall, Zebukiel was a prominent 
leader in the aristocracy of Io’vanthor, the lost city of 
the dragonborn. He was charismatic and influential, 
cherishing his high position in Arkhosia. He believed 
he could do no wrong in the eyes of his people.
 
Everything changed when the darkness of Bael 
Turath became too great to ignore. Arkhosia had been 
hostile toward the tiefling empire for years, with 
many nobles pushing to wipe out Bael Turath. As 
word of tiefling atrocities and hideous obeisance to 
Asmodeus reached them, the dragonborn clamored 
to finally purge the world of their stain. Both dragon-
born and dragons feared that if they waited, they 
would fight a war against the tieflings on their own 
lands.
 
DC 25: After a few skirmishes, total war broke

dragonborn, and the wings of soaring dragons 
blotted out the sun. The numbers of dead were 
appalling, and every effort at achieving peace only 
laid the foundation for the next battle. Both lands 
seemed doomed to perish.
 
Fearing the end of his empire, Zebukiel did the 
unthinkable—he betrayed his kind. The fang dragon 
treated with the tiefling leaders, who claimed to want 
peace as badly as he did. The tieflings swore they 
would lay down their weapons and draw up a lasting 
peace if the Arkhosian “aggressors” were stopped. 
DC 30: Zebukiel knew he could not reason with 
his peers, whom for decades he had tried to turn 
from their self-destructive path. So, under cover of 
darkness, he systematically murdered the Arkhosian 
leaders, dragon and dragonborn alike. Although he 
justified each death as being necessary for peace, he 
slid deeper into madness as the casualties mounted 
and the war continued to rage. Concealing his awful 
deeds grew ever more difficult—too much blood 
stained his claws.
DC 35: When Zebukiel failed to kill a powerful 
adamantine dragon that was injured fighting a pit 
fiend, his victim escaped and revealed his betrayal. 
Before the Arkhosians could deal with the traitor, 
the bulk of their armies perished in the earthquake 
that swallowed Bael Turath and brought an end to 
both nations. The death of his land gave Zebukiel the 
chance he needed to escape, but not before an exarch 
of Bahamut nearly killed him and laid the curse upon 
him as he flew away. 
Tactics
Zebukiel plays the part of an old and wounded 
dragon, projecting an aura of sorrow that leads his vic-
tims to believe him an imposing but harmless beast. 
He lures them close by shrinking back, then dis-
cards the ruse and attacks ferociously. He fights out 
of terror that his next foe will be the one to end his 
curse and visit unspeakable agony upon him.
 
Zebukiel’s favorite tactic is to raise his spiked tail 
and snap his wings back to propel himself forward 
with a sudden lunge. The added speed lets him drive 
the tines of his tail spikes through an opponent. Then 
he savages that foe while other threats are neutral-
ized by his petrifying attacks.
 
Zebukiel is not as quick to use his breath weapon
as are other dragons. He waits until his foes have 
battered him almost to the point of being bloodied, 
hoping to exploit the psychic feedback triggered by 
his bloodied doom.
Encounter Groups
Zebukiel is a loner by necessity. He shuns all others, 
especially dragons and dragonborn. He rarely stays in 
one place for long. 
Zebukiel travels to the world’s farthest corners, always 
staying one-step ahead of his enemies, real or imagined. 
Though he’s always moving, always flying from haven to 
haven, he does keep a few strongholds and settles into 
these old lairs from time to time, but never in the same 
order. Having regular haunts is dangerous, but Zebukiel 
uses them to store his treasures, baubles recovered from 
Arkhosian ruins and from creature’s he has slain, since he 
cannot carry them with him. So he tucks them away in 
dark tunnels, sunken chambers, or vaults beneath ancient 
structures long reclaimed by the wilderness.
 
Even though he selects out-of-the-way locations for 
these “safe houses,” Zebukiel is wise enough to keep them 
under guard. Constructs form the bulk of his servants, 
since their loyalty can’t be compromised, but he has also 
arranged protection with a few other groups. Beneath an 
old mountain, a grimlock tribe worships the dragon as a 
god after he helped fight back grells bent on enslaving the 
Underdark dwellers. A group of savage kobolds protects 
an old temple deep in a jungle, using poisoned darts, 
traps, and fearsome creatures to secure the dragon’s lair. 
The gray dragon has even gained the service of a tiefling 
necromancer. In exchange for allowing the dark mage to 
use the relics for his own research, Zebukiel can rely on an 
army of undead to keep him safe while he rests between 
journeys.
 
Each alliance is dangerous since any can betray him, 
just as he did his own kind. So, the dragon rarely main-
tains these relationships for long, letting them persist for 
a couple of years until he turns against his servants, wiping 
them out root and branch before forging some new alli-
ance somewhere else.

JOEL THOMAS
As described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, you can 
add a functional template to a monster to adapt it to 
a given purpose. The following new templates allows 
you to create interesting and unique foes that capture 
the essence of dragonkind.
DRACONIC CREATURE
Dragons have always been a source of fascination for 
mortals. Many come to revere dragons as more than 
beings of rapacious hunger and cruelty that embody 
devastation. Such people believe that they can harness 
the power of dragons to breed new, superior creatures 
that fuse their own abilities with those of dragonkind.
 
Dragonspawn are the best-known result of such 
misguided efforts, beings created by Tiamat and 
other powers to harness the power of true dragons 
in pliable servants. A great many creatures, though, 
claim ancestry from one variety of dragon or another. 
Such creatures are freaks and outcasts, despised for 
their malformed appearance and violent behavior.
 
“Draconic” is a template that can be added to any 
natural beast or humanoid. This template works best 
with brutes and soldiers. If you are modifying a non-
player character, the fighter, warlord, and brawny 
rogue classes are best suited to the template. The dra-
conic template typically reflects a creature in service 
to or allied with dragons, or one that has been shaped 
by them. Draconic creatures might also be descen-
dants of those that once worked alongside dragons.
 
The draconic template is an excellent way to 
create classic dragon hybrids, whether loyal servants 
or hideous mutants. Adding it to a horse produces a 
dragonne; adding it to a centaur gives you a dracotaur.
 
Prerequisite: Natural beast or humanoid

DRAGONGUARD
These trusted servants are among the few creatures 
that can fight alongside a dragon and not be treated 
as fodder. A dragon has only one dragonguard, which 
might hold a leadership position in its forces or serve 
as an emissary to the outside world at the behest of its 
reclusive master.
 
A dragonguard retains this privilege only through 
total loyalty. It must have a dragon patron; if that 
patron dies or dismisses it, the dragonguard loses the 
benefit of the template. (It might be able to regain 
them if it finds another dragon patron.)
 
“Dragonguard” is a template that can be added to 
any creature to represent a loyal servant that fights 
alongside a dragon without getting in its way. If you 
are modifying a nonplayer character, this template 
works best with the fighter class.

ALTERNATIVE POWERS
The powers possessed by dragons described in this 
book and in the Monster Manual are typical of chro-
matic dragons, but they are but a sampling of those 
available. This section presents alternative dragon 
powers that you can substitute for others to make new 
and interesting dragon opponents.
Black Dragon Powers
As creatures of fens and bogs, black dragons reflect 
the pervasive decay found in such forlorn places. 
The following alternative powers reflect black drag-
ons’ chosen environments and demonstrate talents 
to let them to take advantage of the native flora and 
fauna.
Animate Plants
This power is designed to be used by an ancient black 
dragon instead of vitriolic spray.
C Animate Plants (standard; recharge ⚄ ⚅) ✦ Zone
 
Close burst 5; level + 2 vs. Reﬂ ex; 1d10 + one-half level damage, 
and the target is restrained (save ends). The burst creates a zone 
of entangling plants that remains in place as long as the dragon’s 
space is entirely within the zone. All creatures other than the 
dragon treat the area within the zone as diffi  cult terrain.
Stinging Vermin
This power works best for an elder or ancient black 
dragon. It replaces vitriolic spray.
Stinging Vermin aura 5; any creature that starts its turn within 
the aura takes 10 damage and is blinded and slowed until the 
start of its next turn.
Blue Dragon Powers
Blue dragons love violent storms, and they make their 
lairs in sea caves, remote islands, and other places 
exposed to stormy weather. These alternative powers 
reflect their control of thunder and lightning.
Mirage
An elder or ancient blue dragon can have this power 
in place of thunderclap.
A Mirage (standard; recharge ⚅) ✦ Illusion, Psychic
 
Burst 3 within 20; level + 4 vs. Will; psychic damage equal to 
that from that dragon’s thunderclap, and the target is blinded 
(save ends).
Thunderbolt
Any blue dragon can use this power instead of light-
ning burst.
A Thunderbolt (standard; recharge ⚄ ⚅) ✦ Thunder
 
Area burst 2 within 10; level + 4 vs. Fortitude; thunder damage 
equal to that from the dragon’s lightning burst, and the target is 
deafened (save ends). This power does not deal half damage on 
a miss.
Brown Dragon Powers
In the cruel desert environment, burrowing offers 
brown dragons relief from the sun. A few brown drag-
ons lose the ability to fly, instead spending all their 
time beneath the ground.
Rising Bite
Any brown dragon can have this power in place of its 
fly speed.
M Rising Bite (standard; recharge ⚄ ⚅)
 
The brown dragon moves up to its burrow speed just below the 
surface of the ground, avoiding opportunity attacks as it passes 
underneath other creatures’ spaces. As it burrows beneath the 
space of a creature on the ground, the dragon makes a bite 
attack against the creature.
Sinkhole
This power, for an ancient brown dragon, replaces 
sand cloud.
A Sinkhole (standard; recharge ⚄ ⚅) ✦ Zone
 
Area burst 5 within 20; level + 3 vs. Reﬂ ex; 3d10 + Constitution 
modiﬁ er damage, and the target is restrained (save ends). The 
burst creates a zone of collapsing sand that remains in place 
until the end of the encounter. All creatures other than the 
dragon treat the area within the zone as diffi  cult terrain.
Strike from Below
Instead of quicksand vortex, an elder or ancient brown 
dragon can use this power.
M Strike from Below (standard; encounter)
 
The brown dragon moves up to half its burrow speed just below 
the surface of the ground, makes two claw attacks, and then 
moves up to half its burrow speed again. This movement does 
not provoke opportunity attacks.
Gray Dragon Powers
Some gray dragons have acid running through their 
veins, allowing them to deliver a caustic bite or retali-
ate with an acidic spray against foes who harm them. 
Others increase their horrifying aspect to make 
enemies hesitate in battle.
Acid Spray
Any gray dragon can swap warding tail for this power.
Alternative Powers

C Acid Spray (immediate reaction, when en enemy damages the 
dragon; at-will) ✦ Acid

acid damage (save ends). The ongoing damage increases to 10 at

In place of its breath weapon, any gray dragon can use 
this power.
M Caustic Bite (standard; recharge ⚄ ⚅) ✦ Acid

target is weakened and takes ongoing acid damage equal

clever manipulation and outright domination. They 
are accomplished liars, using honeyed words to erode 
the mind and unravel their victims’ resolve.

replaces mind poison.
R Dominate Mortal (standard; recharge ⚄ ⚅) ✦ Charm, Psychic
 
Ranged 10; level + 3 vs. Will; 1d8 + Charisma modiﬁ er psychic 
damage, and the target is dominated and takes ongoing 5

Area burst 5 within 10; targets enemies; level + 4 vs. Will; 
the target does nothing on its turn except attack the nearest 
creature (enemy or ally), moving if necessary (save ends). The

By giving up its bite attack, any purple dragon can 
gain this power.
C Mind Hammer (standard; at-will) ✦ Fear
 
Close blast 5; level + 4 vs. Will; the target is pushed 3 squares 
and dazed (save ends).

squares and knocked prone, and takes ongoing 10 psychic 
damage (save ends).

ible power and ferocity, the undisputed masters of 
dragonkind. These alternative powers reinforce their 
arrogance and might.

place of its tail strike.
C Shock Wave (minor; recharge ⚄ ⚅)
 
Close burst 5; level + 4 vs. Fortitude; the target is pushed 5 
squares, is knocked prone, and is dazed (save ends). Aftereff ect:

strike for an adult or older red dragon.
M Snatch (immediate interrupt, when an enemy moves into a 
square adjacent to the dragon; at-will)
 
The dragon attacks the triggering enemy; level + 5 vs. Reﬂ ex; 
the target takes damage equal to that from the dragon’s claw 
attack and is grabbed (until escape). First Failed Escape Attempt:

ful presence.
C Terrifying Presence (standard; encounter) ✦ Fear

moves its speed away from the red dragon by the safest route 
possible and is weakened until the end of its next turn.

253
C H A P T E R  4  |  N e w  M o n s t e r s
ALTERNATIVE POWERS
White Dragon Powers
Brutish creatures acclimated to the cold, white drag-
ons have a well-deserved reputation for being crude 
but dangerous. They sometimes hone their abilities to 
better exploit their advantages.
Battering Wings
An adult or older white dragon can have this power 
instead of dragon’s fury.
M Battering Wings (standard; recharge ⚃ ⚄ ⚅)
 
The dragon makes two attacks; level + 3 vs. AC; 2d6 + Strength 
modiﬁ er damage. If one attack hits, the target is pushed a 
number of squares equal to the dragon’s reach; if both hit, it 
is pushed twice that distance instead. The damage increases 
to 3d6 + Strength modiﬁ er at 11th level, and to and 4d6 + 
Strength modiﬁ er at 21st level.
Glacial Armor
Any white dragon can exchange frightful presence for 
this power.
Glacial Armor (minor; encounter) ✦ Cold
 
The dragon gains 3 temporary hit points per level and a +2 
bonus to AC but also gains vulnerable 10 ﬁ re. These eff ects last 
until the temporary hit points granted by this power are gone.
Bloodscaled Fury
Some dragons enter a fierce state of battle frenzy 
when cornered. Legend holds that these dragons have 
a touch of demonic blood, owing to a bizarre alliance 
between Bahamut and an ancient enemy of Tiamat. 
Tiamat’s faithful hunt these dragons with fanatical 
abandon.
 
Bloodscaled furies are more likely to engage in 
mindless, wanton destruction than other dragons. 
They are usually chaotic evil.
Bloodscaled Frenzy
Any dragon can become a bloodscaled fury and gain 
this power by giving up bloodied breath.
Bloodscaled Frenzy (only while bloodied)
 
The dragon gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls and a +4 bonus 
to damage rolls until the end of the encounter. Its damage 
resistance, if any, increases by 5, and it gains one use of resist 
10 variable (MM 282). If the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points, it 
can make a melee basic attack before being destroyed.
Consort of Tiamat
Dragons are rarely perceived as religious, but a few 
cultivate faith in and ironbound loyalty to Tiamat. 
Those who display sufficient devotion to the Dragon 
Queen and complete difficult tasks in her name 
receive this blessing.
Glory of Tiamat
Any dragon can become a consort of Tiamat and gain 
this power by giving up bloodied breath.
 
Tiamat can exercise her divine will to confer con-
sort status even on beings who do not have a bloodied 
breath ability to give up. As far as lorekeepers know, 
she has done so only once.
C Glory of Tiamat (standard, while bloodied; encounter)
 
Close burst 5; level + 4 vs. Will; the target is pushed 3 squares, 
knocked prone, and dazed (save ends).
Polychromatic Dragons
Sometimes chromatic dragons display abilities from 
two or more different draconic lines. A white dragon 
might have a tinge of fire in its breath, while a blue 
dragon might exude the poison normally expelled by 
a green. These so-called “polychromatic” wyrms are 
said to be particularly favored by Tiamat, since in a 
way they share her multicolored nature.
 
To represent these polychromatic dragons in your 
game, choose one of the bloodlines described below 
and apply its effects and benefits to a dragon that is 
not of the bloodline’s color.
 
If you give a young or older dragon a bloodline that 
turns it into a polychromatic dragon, it is also entitled 
to gain the power associated with that bloodline in 
exchange for a power or ability it already had. 
 
It’s not possible for a dragon to have an alternative 
power from the previous section as well as a poly-
chromatic power from this section if both powers 
require the replacement of the same power or abil-
ity. For instance, a white dragon that has exchanged 
frightful presence for glacial armor can also gain the 
red bloodline. But it cannot also take the inferno 
wave power, since that power also replaces frightful 
presence.
Black Bloodline
The black bloodline gives a dragon a swim speed 
equal to its fly speed. The dragon’s breath weapon also 
deals acid damage in addition to its normal damage 
type.
 
A dragon that has the black bloodline can gain 
cloak of darkness in exchange for frightful presence.
C Cloak of Darkness (minor; encounter)
 
Close burst 3; this power creates an area of darkness that 
remains in place until the end of the dragon’s next turn. The 
area blocks line of sight for all creatures except the dragon.
Blue Bloodline
A dragon of the blue bloodline gains resist 5 light-
ning. This resistance increases to 10 at 11th level 
and to 15 at 21st level. The dragon’s breath weapon 
also deals lightning damage in addition to its normal 
damage.

254
C H A P T E R  4  |  N e w  M o n s t e r s
 
In place of frightful presence, the dragon can use the 
lightning burst power.
C Lightning Burst (standard; encounter) ✦ Lightning
 
Close burst 3; level + 4 vs. Reﬂ ex; 1d10 + one-half level damage, 
and the target is dazed (save ends).
Brown Bloodline
The brown bloodline provides a dragon with resist 5 
fire. This resistance increases to 10 at 11th level and 
to 15 at 21st level. The dragon’s breath weapon also 
deals fire damage in addition to its normal damage.
 
A dragon of the brown bloodline can exchange its 
fly speed for a burrow speed, as described below.
Speed The dragon gains a burrow speed equal to one-half its land 
speed.
Gray Bloodline
A dragon that has the gray bloodline gains resist 5 
acid. This resistance increases to 10 at 11th level and 
to 15 at 21st level. The dragon’s breath weapon also 
deals acid damage in addition to its normal damage.
 
By giving up frightful presence, a dragon of the gray 
bloodline can gain the cruel cuts power.
Cruel Cuts (minor; encounter)
 
Until the end of the dragon’s next turn, its melee attacks also 
deal ongoing 5 damage (save ends). The ongoing damage 
increases to 10 at 11th level, and to 15 at 21st level.
Green Bloodline
The green bloodline gives a dragon resist 5 poison. 
This resistance increases to 10 at 11th level and to 
15 at 21st level. The dragon’s breath weapon also deals 
poison damage in addition to its normal damage.
 
The green bloodline enables a dragon to have the 
beckoning glare power in place of frightful presence.
R Beckoning Glare (minor 1/round; encounter) ✦ Charm, Gaze
 
Ranged 10; level + 4 vs. Will; the target is pulled 2 squares and 
grants combat advantage against all attacks until the end of the 
dragon’s current turn.
Purple Bloodline
A dragon of the purple bloodline gains training in 
Stealth. The dragon’s breath weapon also deals psychic 
damage in addition to its normal damage.
 
By replacing frightful presence, a dragon of the 
purple bloodline can have the overwhelming gaze
power.
R Overwhelming Gaze (standard; encounter) ✦ Charm, Gaze
 
Ranged 10; level + 4 vs. Will; the target is stunned until the end 
of the dragon’s next turn.

This resistance increases to 10 at 11th level and to 15 
at 21st level. The dragon’s breath weapon also deals fire 
damage in addition to its normal damage.

the red bloodline in exchange for frightful presence.

15 at 21st level. The dragon’s breath weapon also deals

next turn.

NEW MONSTERS
Every new monster in this book appears on the following list, which is sorted alphabetically by level and monster 
role. Monster leaders are indicated with an (L).

The high-stakes game of chance preferred by 
D&D characters of all classes and levels!
Three Dragon Ante™ is a fast-paced non-collectable
card game based on the tavern games played by  
characters within the D&D game world. Three Dragon Ante
can be played as a stand-alone card game when there isn’t
enough time for a full-ﬂedged D&D adventure, or it can be
played as part of a roleplaying campaign, where a character’s
abilities can give him or her a unique winning edge.

Get drunk. On fun, of course. 
With a roll of the dice, you determine whether to hurl a mug
of ale at the warbling bard or smash a chair over the drunken
barbarian’s back. Treachery and chaos abound, as every game
promises a new and hilarious tavern brawling experience. 
Choose a character, trade some dice rolls with your friends,
and see who’s left standing in the end!
