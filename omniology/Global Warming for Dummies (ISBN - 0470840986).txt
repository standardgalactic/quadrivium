About the Authors
Elizabeth E. May has been recognized by the United Nations for her work in the 
environmental movement, both in June 1990 with the Global 500 Role of Honor 
for Environmental Achievement and on International Women’s Day, March 8, 
2006 by the United Nations Environment Program as one of the leading women in 
environment globally. Since 1997, she has served as a Commissioner in the Earth 
Charter Commission, co-chaired by Mikhail Gorbachev and Maurice Strong. Dr. 
May assisted in organizing the fi rst international, comprehensive scientifi c con-
ference into the climate change threat, in June 1988, hosted by Canada. She was 
engaged in the negotiation of the Montreal Protocol as Senior Policy Advisor to 
Canada’s Minister of the Environment. She was a member of the International 
Policy Advisory Committee, World Women’s Congress for a Healthy Planet, 
Miami, November 1991, served as an advisor in many capacities in the prepara-
tion for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the 
Earth Summit), and was a board member for nine years for the International 
Institute for Sustainable Development. 
Dr. May was Executive Director of Sierra Club of Canada for seventeen years, 
before leaving that position in 2006 to enter politics. She is currently the 
Leader of the Green Party of Canada. Dr. May is a lawyer, an author of six 
published books on Canadian environmental issues, and, most importantly, 
a mother and grandmother. Among many prestigious Canadian awards and 
honors, Dr. May has received the highest citizen honor in Canada, the Order 
of Canada, at the Offi cer level.
Zoë Caron has worked on initiatives to green university campuses through 
the Sierra Youth Coalition’s Sustainable Campuses and the Energy Action 
Coalition’s Campus Climate Challenge. Zoë is a founding member of the 
Canadian Youth Climate Coalition and past youth delegate to United Nations 
Climate Change Conferences in Canada and Kenya. 
Identifi ed as an emerging leader on climate change, she was profi led among col-
leagues as “The Next Generation” in Vanity Fair’s 2007 Green Issue. She works 
with Students on Ice Expeditions, bringing students from around the world to the 
Arctic and Antarctic to learn about the importance of these regions to the rest of 
the planet. She currently writes for the Green Content Creation Group and serves 
on the Board of Directors of the Sierra Club of Canada.

Dedication
Elizabeth dedicates this book to her children and grandchildren, in hopes 
that by the time the youngest of you is old enough to read this book, the 
prognosis will be very different and far more hopeful.
Zoë dedicates this book to every individual who has dedicated her or him 
self to advocate climate change issues since the 1980s to bring the global 
community to the level of awareness we are at today.
And it goes without saying that they both dedicate this book to you, the 
reader, for making the choice to read about climate change.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Zoë and Elizabeth both want to express deep appreciation to many friends 
and colleagues who assisted in the research and writing of this book. A 
special thank you to Dr. Ian Burton, Dr. Jim Bruce, and Dr. Gordon McBean, 
leading scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who 
helped ensure the accuracy of the information presented in this book. Deep 
thanks to How-Sen Chong, founder of Carbonzero, for endless fact-checks 
and data provisions. We’re grateful to those that have helped review chapter 
content: Dr. O.W. Archibold of the University of Saskatchewan; Dr. Jonathan 
Newman of the University of Guelph; Peter Howard of Zerofootprint; Ruth 
Edwards of the Canada Climate Action Network; Kristopher Stevens of the 
Ontario Sustainable Energy Association; and to the David Suzuki Foundation 
team of Nick Heap, Paul Lingl, and Dale Marshall. (As always, any errors and 
omissions are the authors’ alone.) Thanks also to key image providers, Dr. 
Max Boykoff of the Oxford University Centre for the Environment, and John 
Streicker of the Northern Climate Exchange.
To Debra Eindigeur, Elizabeth’s Executive Assistant, for assistance in manag-
ing the manuscript and ensuring drafts changed hands in timely fashion. To 
Cendrine Huemer and Jaymini Bihka for their research work. Ongoing grati-
tude to the countless colleagues called on for advice, feedback, or data.
Zoë and Elizabeth also want to express their deepest gratitude to the 
seemingly endless patience of our editor Robert Hickey for his always-excellent 
advice, text maneuvering, and overall guidance. A big thanks to those who 
worked behind the scenes: editor Colleen Totz-Diamond, our copy editor Laura 
Miller, project coordinator Lindsay Humphreys, and our brand reviewers 
Rev Mengle, Zoë Wykes, and Jennifer Bingham.

Elizabeth wants to say that (once again, as in previous books) nothing would 
be possible without the extraordinary grace, patience, and support of her 
daughter, Victoria Cate May Burton. No one has ever had a better daughter, 
and few have known a better person. 
Zoë wants to thank her ever-patient friend Lilith Wyatt for postponing their 
South America excursion and for the many locutorio visits throughout the 
four-month trek. She thanks Jessica Budgell for her always-there encourage-
ment, and Zoë apologizes to all those from whom she took a rain check so 
that she could spend time with her laptop instead.
This book was made possible by people who — intentionally or not — 
provided the most timely, impromptu, and gracious writing locales: the 
owners of Coburg Coffee in Halifax and of Planet Coffee and Bridgeheads in 
Ottawa, Liz McDowell, Louise Comeau, parents Michael Fischer and Julie 
Caron, Panny Taylor, Candace Batycki, Adriane Carr and Paul George, Anjali 
Helferty and Roxanne Charlebois, Kathryn Kinley, and Reina Lahtinen.
Last and foremost, Zoë thanks Elizabeth for endless mentorship, teaching, 
and patience. Few others would take time to edit while running a federal 
political party, recovering in-hospital from surgery, or making lobster salad 
for sixty.

Introduction
O
n Monday, the newspapers tell you the ice caps are melting, and people 
everywhere are about to be swept off in a giant flood. On Tuesday, you 
hear a radio interview with a scientist who says global warming is all a hoax. 
Wednesday finds you standing in the grocery line, listening to people mut-
tering about how strangely warm the weather has been outside recently. By 
Thursday, you just don’t know what to think anymore.
Think of today as Friday — the day all these stray pieces come together right 
here in your hands, thanks to Global Warming For Dummies.
Global warming is already changing the environment, the economy, and 
people’s ways of living. The changes aren’t over, either, and the more that 
changes around the world, the more you have to understand what global warm-
ing is. But you know what? It’s really quite exciting. Although global warming 
is connected to scary scenarios featuring soaring temperatures and worsening 
hurricanes and monsoons, it’s also a link to a better future. Global warming is 
opening doors for the development of new types of fuels, leading the shift to 
reliable energy sources, and creating a vision of a greener tomorrow. And the 
best part? You’re right in the middle of it all, helping to make those changes.
About This Book
Global Warming For Dummies is your guide to climate change. We use climate 
change and global warming interchangeably in this book, though they are 
slightly different things, as we discuss in Chapter 1. This book gives you the 
basics so that you can understand the problem, relate it to your daily life, and 
be inspired to start working on solutions to this complex and important issue.
In this book, we explain the concepts behind global warming clearly and simply 
by using the latest, most credible science, mainly from the Fourth Assessment 
Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).The IPCC is 
a team of more than 2,000 scientists who assess peer-reviewed climate change 
science and compile the assessments into a number of reports. These reports 
are mainly to inform the politicians and bureaucrats at the United Nations’ 
decision-making table, but anyone looking for detailed scientific information 
on climate change can read them. The IPCC is the most credible source of cli-
mate change information in the world today. (We discuss the IPCC in greater 
detail in Chapter 11.)

Global Warming For Dummies 
Although this book covers what global warming is and its impact on the 
world, Global Warming For Dummies isn’t just about the science. The book 
also looks at a wide range of solutions to tackle climate change. We explore 
everything from the big-picture solutions that governments can implement to 
a slew of practical, can-do-it-today solutions for you at work, at home, and on 
the road.
Foolish Assumptions
We wrote this book assuming that you know zero, nil, zilch about global 
warming. You don’t have to look up the definitions of big, ridiculous words or 
drag out your high school science textbook to read this book.
We also assume, however, that you know global warming exists, that you 
recognize humans contribute to this problem, and that you want to under-
stand why global warming is happening.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts, covering everything you need to know 
about the causes and effects of global warming — and the solutions.
Part I: Understanding Global Warming
This part sorts out what global warming actually is. If you want to understand 
the science behind why the world’s climate is changing, check out these 
chapters. We take a look at the infamous greenhouse gases and explore how 
they’re changing the way the climate works. We also consider some of the 
other factors that are shaping the planet’s climate and explain why scientists 
are almost entirely certain that humanity’s production of greenhouse gases is 
heating up the atmosphere.
Part II: Tracking Down the Causes
Part II explains where all the greenhouse gases we talk about in Part I are 
coming from. Two major offenders exist: fossil fuels (¾ of the problem) and 
deforestation (1/4 of the problem). In this part, we investigate where fossil 
fuels come from and why they have such a huge influence on the atmo-
sphere. We also look at where and why deforestation is happening, and why 
it’s a major cause of climate change. Finally, we investigate how businesses 

3
 Introduction
and individuals have unwittingly set climate change into motion through 
emitting greenhouse gases.
Part III: Examining the Effects 
of Global Warming
In this part, we look at how global warming is creating changes around the 
world. We review what has already happened because of climate change and 
consider what the future might hold. From natural disasters such as floods 
and storms, to mass extinctions in the animal world, to the heavy toll global 
warming could take on humanity, the picture’s pretty grim if civilization 
keeps doing what it’s doing. Fortunately, people can change direction — so 
keep reading!
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global 
Warming Nationally and Internationally
Not everyone loves politicians, but in this part, we look at how their work can 
go a long way to help fight global warming. First of all, we consider how gov-
ernments at every level — from presidents to mayors — can help cut back on 
greenhouse gas emissions. Then, we look at how countries can work together 
to tackle this truly global challenge. The economic challenge of global warm-
ing is particularly daunting for developing nations. In the last chapter of this 
part, we investigate developing nations’ situations and see what steps they’re 
taking to be part of the solution to global warming.
Part V: Solving the Problem
Solving global warming is requiring a lot of changes on a lot of different 
fronts, which is why this part is the longest in the book. Some of these 
changes are quite modest; most are quite major. First, civilization needs to 
shake its addiction to fossil fuels and find new, cleaner renewable energy 
sources. Happily, those energy sources are out there (and in this part).
Businesses and industries play a major role, too; we look at how they can cut 
back on their greenhouse gas emissions and make money, to boot. Another 
part of solving the problem is raising awareness. Non-government organiza-
tions have a big role to play in getting people’s attention. So, too, does the 
media. Some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are getting involved, as well, lending 
their stellar wattage to the cause and adapting conscientiously eco-green life-
styles. And most importantly, it’s down to you, the reader, and the countless 
ways that you can contribute to the fight against global warming.

Part VI: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without the Part of Tens. Think of these 
lists as quick little hits of global warming wisdom. We cover ten things you 
can do right now to fight global warming, profile ten inspiring people who are 
leading the charge against climate change, debunk ten myths about global 
warming, and offer ten great online resources. Flip to these chapters when-
ever you need a fast bit of information or a quick jolt of inspiration.

f you have questions about the science behind global 
warming, this part is the place to start. We introduce 
you to greenhouse gases, explain why they’re vital for life 
on Earth, and provide you with a blueprint that explains 
just how they’re heating up the atmosphere. We also 
investigate why scientists are certain that greenhouse 
gases are the cause of the global warming that we’re expe-
riencing today, and we consider some of the other factors 
that could be contributing to climate change.

 Finding solutions to the problem
T
he phrase “global warming” hasn’t been around long, but climate change, 
as it’s also known, is nothing new. In fact, it has been a constant through-
out history. Earth’s climate today is very different from what it was 2 million 
years ago, let alone 10,000 years ago. Since the beginnings of the most primi-
tive life forms, this planet has seen many different climates, from the hot, dry 
Jurassic period of the dinosaurs to the bleak, frozen landscapes of the ice ages.
Today, however, the planet’s experiencing something new: Its climate is 
warming up very quickly. Scientists are certain that this change has been 
caused by emissions produced by human activities. By examining previous 
changes in the Earth’s climate, using computer models, and measuring cur-
rent changes in atmospheric chemistry, they can estimate what global warm-
ing might mean for the planet, and their projections are scary.
Fortunately, Earth isn’t locked into the worst-case-scenario fate yet. By 
banding together, people can put the brakes on global warming. This chap-
ter explains the essentials of global warming and what everyone can do to 
achieve a greener future.
Global Warming 101
When “global warming” became a household phrase, greenhouse gases, which 
trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, got a bad reputation. After all, those gases 
are to blame for heating up the planet. But, as we discuss in Chapter 2, green-
house gases in reasonable quantities aren’t villains, they’re heroes. They capture 
the sun’s warmth and keep it around so that life is possible on Earth. The 

10
Par t I: Understanding Global Warming 
problem starts when the atmosphere contains too great an amount of green-
house gases. (In Chapter 3, we look at how scientists have determined the 
correlation between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and temperature.)
Heating things up with greenhouse gases
Human activities — primarily, the burning of fossil fuels (which we look at 
in the section “The Roots of Global Warming,” later in this chapter) — have 
resulted in growing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere. As we explain in Chapter 2, these increasing quanti-
ties of greenhouse gases are retaining more and more of the sun’s heat. The 
heat trapped by the carbon dioxide blanket is raising temperatures all over 
the world — hence, global warming.
So far, Earth has seen a 1.4-degree Fahrenheit (0.8-degree Celsius) increase 
in global average temperature because of increased greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere. Unfortunately, the amount of greenhouse gases that human activi-
ties produce grows daily. So, humanity’s current behavior is driving tempera-
tures up at an alarming rate. Temperatures in polar regions, such as the Arctic, 
are experiencing temperature rises that are twice the global average.
Investigating other causes 
of global warming
Global warming is a very complex issue that you can’t totally understand 
without looking at the ifs, ands, or buts. Scientists are certain that the rapid 
changes to climate systems are due to the build-up of greenhouse gases, and 
they can’t explain the current rates of global warming without factoring in 
the impact of human greenhouse gas emissions. Other elements play a role in 
shaping the planet’s climate, however, including the following:
 
 Cloud cover: Clouds are connected to humidity, temperature, and rainfall. 
When temperatures change, so can a climate’s clouds — and vice versa.
 
 Long-term climate trends: The Earth has a history of going in and out of 
ice ages and warm periods. Scientific records of carbon dioxide levels in 
the atmosphere go back 800,000 years, but people can only give 
educated guesses about the climate earlier than that.
 
 Solar cycles: The sun goes through a cycle that brings it closer to or 
farther away from the Earth. This cycle ultimately affects the 
temperature of this planet, and thus the climate.
We go over these other issues in greater detail in Chapter 3.

11
 Chapter 1: Global Warming Basics
The Roots of Global Warming
Just what are humans doing to release all those greenhouse gases into the 
atmosphere? You can pin the blame on two main offenses: burning fossil 
fuels and deforestation.
Fueling global warming
 
When you burn fossil fuels, such as coal and oil (named fossil fuels because 
they’re composed of ancient plant and animal material), they release vast 
amounts of greenhouse gases (largely, but not exclusively, carbon dioxide), 
which trap heat in the atmosphere. Fossil fuels are also a limited resource — 
meaning that humanity can’t count on them over the long term because even-
tually they’ll just run out.
The fossil fuel that produces the most greenhouse gas emissions is coal, 
and burning coal to produce electricity is the major source of coal-related 
greenhouse gases. The second-worst offender is using gasoline and diesel 
for transportation, followed by burning oil to generate heat and electricity. 
In fact, if people could replace the coal-fired power plants around the world 
and switch away from the internal combustion engine, humanity would have 
most of the problem licked. (Check out Chapter 4 for more fossil fuel info and 
Chapter 13 for the scoop on energy alternatives.)
Heating up over deforestation
Forests, conserved land, and natural habitats aren’t important just for the sake 
of saving trees and animals. Forests and all greenery are important players 
in keeping the climate in check. Plants take in the carbon that’s in the atmo-
sphere and give back oxygen, and older trees hold on to that carbon, storing it 
for the duration of their lives. By taking in carbon dioxide, they’re significantly 
reducing the greenhouse effect. (See Chapter 2 for more about how plants help 
the Earth keep atmospheric carbon at a reasonable level.)
Unfortunately, much of the world’s forests have been cut down to make way 
for farmland, highways, and cities. Deforestation is responsible for about a 
quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. Rainforests are especially good at soak-
ing up carbon dioxide because they breathe all year round. Temperate for-
ests, on the other hand, don’t absorb much carbon dioxide over the winter, 
practically going into hibernation. (Chapter 5 has more about deforestation.)

Par t I: Understanding Global Warming 
Examining the Effects of Global 
Warming Around the World
This book should really be called Climate Change for Dummies. Although 
global warming is the common term for the climate changes that the planet’s 
experiencing (and scientists agree that average global temperature will 
increase with the build-up of greenhouse gases), the term doesn’t tell the 
whole story. The Earth’s average surface temperature is going up, but some 
areas of the planet may actually get colder or experience more extreme bouts 
of rain, snow, or ice build-up. Consequently, most scientists prefer the term 
climate change. In the following sections, we look at how different places 
around the world will experience climate change.
 
We want to warn you, much of this section is pretty depressing. But nothing 
is exaggerated — the information here is all based on peer-reviewed scientific 
reports. Just how serious could the global impact of climate change be? The 
first global comprehensive scientific conference, which was held in Toronto, 
Canada, in 1988, described the climate change issue in this way: “Humanity is 
conducting an unintended, uncontrolled, globally pervasive experiment whose 
ultimate consequences could be second only to a global nuclear war.”
The United States and Canada
In the U.S. and Canada, average temperatures have been rising because of cli-
mate change. As a result, the growing season has lengthened; trees have been 
sucking in more carbon, and farms have been more productive. The warmer 
weather hasn’t been all good news, however. Many plants and animals are 
spreading farther north to adapt to climate changes, affecting the existing 
species in the areas to which they’re moving. And increased temperatures 
have already been a factor in more forest fires and damage by forest insects, 
such as the recent pine beetle epidemic in the interior of British Columbia, 
Canada. (See Chapter 8 for more information about how global warming will 
affect animals and forests.)
Scientists project that the U.S. and Canada will feel the effects of climate 
change more adversely in the coming years. Here are some of the problems, 
anticipated to only get worse if civilization doesn’t dramatically reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions:
 
 Droughts: Rising temperatures are increasing droughts in areas that are 
already arid, putting even larger pressure on scarce water sources in 
areas such as the U.S. Southwest.

13
 Chapter 1: Global Warming Basics
 
 Evaporating lakes: The cities in the great heartland of the Great Lakes 
Basin will face retreating shorelines when the water levels of the Great 
Lakes drop because of increased evaporation. Lower water levels will 
also affect ship and barge traffic along the Mississippi, St. Lawrence, and 
other major rivers.
 
 Floods: Warmer air contains more moisture, and North Americans are 
already experiencing more sudden deluge events, causing washed out 
roads and bridges, and flooded basements.
 
 Major storms: Warming oceans increase the risk of extreme weather 
that will plague coastal cities. Think of Hurricane Katrina, arguably the 
most devastating weather event ever to hit a North American city. In a 
possible sign of what’s to come, the super-heated waters of the Gulf of 
Mexico whipped Katrina into a hurricane with a massive punch while it 
crossed from Florida and made landfall in Louisiana, ultimately doing 
more than $200 billion worth of damage.
 
 Not all extreme weather events are hurricanes. Global warming is expected 
to increase ice storms in some areas and thunderstorms in others.
 
 Melting glaciers: Glaciers in the Rockies and in the far North, in both 
Canada and the U.S., are in retreat. Glacier National Park could some day 
be a park where the only glacier is in the name. When glaciers go, 
so does the spring recharge that flows down into the valleys, increasing 
the pressure on the remaining water supplies. People who depend on 
drinking water from rivers or lakes that are fed by mountain glaciers will 
also be vulnerable.
 
 Rising sea levels: Water expands when it gets warmer, so while global 
average temperatures rise, warmer air warms the ocean. Oceans are 
expanding, and sea levels are rising around the world, threatening 
coastal cities — many of which are in the U.S. and Canada. This sea level 
rise could become far more devastating should ice sheets in Greenland 
and Antarctica collapse.
Changes across northern Canada and Alaska are more profound than in the 
south. We discuss these impacts in the section “Polar regions,” later in this 
chapter.
On average, North Americans have many resources, in comparison to 
developing regions of the world, to help them adapt to climate change. The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says Canada and the 
United States can take steps to avoid many of the costs of climate change, 
to better absorb the effects and avoid the loss of human lives. For example, 
North America could establish better storm warning systems and community 
support to make sure that poor people in inner cities have some hope of 
relief during more frequent killer heat waves. (See Chapter 10 for more infor-
mation about what governments can do to help their countries adapt to the 
effects of climate change.)

14
Par t I: Understanding Global Warming 
Latin America
South America has seen some strange weather in the past few years. Drought 
hit the Amazon in 2005, Bolivia had hail storms in 2002, and the torrential 
rainfalls lashed Venezuela in 1999 and 2005. In 2003, for the first time ever, 
a hurricane hit Brazil. Were these strange weather events linked to global 
warming? Scientists can’t say with certainty, but these events are the kind 
expected to occur because of climate change. Scientists do project that 
extreme weather caused by climate change will increase. Events such as 
these may be signs of what’s to come for Latin America.
Other changes in Latin America may be attributable to global warming. Rain 
patterns have been changing significantly. More rain is falling in some places, 
such as Brazil, and less in others, such as southern Peru. Glaciers across 
the continent are melting. This glacier loss is a particular problem in Bolivia, 
Ecuador, and Peru, where many people depend on glacier-fed streams and 
rivers for drinking water and electricity from small-scale hydroelectric plants. 
(See Chapter 9 for more about how global warming will affect humans.)
Scientists project that the worst is yet to come. The IPCC models anticipate 
that about half of the farmland in South America could become more desert-
like or suffer saltwater intrusions. If sea levels continue to rise at a rate of 
0.08 to 0.12 inches (2 to 3 millimeters) per year, it could affect drinking water 
on the west coast of Costa Rica, shoreline tourism in Mexico, and mangrove 
swamps in Brazil.
The threat to the Amazon from logging and burning has attracted the con-
cern of celebrities such as Sting and Leonardo DiCaprio. But human-caused 
global warming could potentially do more damage than loggers. By mid-
century, the IPCC predicts that parts of the Amazon could change from wet 
forest to dry grassland. Such a radical alteration would have an enormous 
impact on the millions of species of plants and animals that make this rich 
ecosystem their home. (We cover how ecosystems will be affected by climate 
change in Chapter 8.)
Europe
Recent findings have shown that climate change is already well under way 
in Europe. Years ago, the IPCC projected the changes that the continent is 
experiencing today: rising temperatures, increased intensity and frequency of 
heat waves, and increased glacier melt.

15
 Chapter 1: Global Warming Basics
As for what’s in store for Europe, the IPCC reports a 99-percent chance that 
Europe will experience other unfavorable climate changes. These changes 
may include the following:
 
 Increased occurrence of rock falls in some mountainous regions because 
of melting permafrost loosening mountain walls.
 
 More flash floods in inland areas.
 
 More heat waves and droughts in central, eastern, and southern Europe. 
This will have an impact on health and tourism in southern Europe in 
particular.
 
 Rising sea levels, which will increase erosion. These rising sea levels, 
coupled with storm surges, will also cause coastal flooding. The 
Netherlands and Venice will have greater trouble than other areas in 
Europe dealing with the rising sea level.
 
 The loss of up to 60-percent of Europe’s native species of plants and 
animals. Fisheries will also be stressed.
 
 Countries sitting on the North Atlantic are likely to see a growth in fisheries, 
according to the IPCC.
These possibilities are all serious, but none of them represents the worst-
case scenario — the Gulf Stream stalling. The results of this (stopping of a 
major ocean current) would be disastrous for Europe. (We look at the Gulf 
Stream in Chapter 7.) Although the Gulf Stream stalling is possible, the IPCC 
doesn’t consider this possibility likely.
Africa
On a per-person basis, Africans have contributed the very least to global warm-
ing because of overall low levels of industrial development. Just look at a com-
posite photo of the planet at night: The U.S., southern Canada, and Europe are 
lit up like Christmas trees, burning energy that results in greenhouse gas 
emissions. Africa, on the other hand, shows very few lights: some offshore oil 
rigs twinkle, and a few cities shine, but the continent is mostly dark.
Despite contributing very little to the source of the problem, many countries 
in Africa are already experiencing effects of global warming. Long periods of 
drought followed by deluge rainfall have had devastating impacts in places 
such as Mozambique. Coastal areas in East Africa have suffered damage from 
storm surges and rising sea levels.

16
Par t I: Understanding Global Warming 
 
Unfortunately, because of pervasive poverty and the scourge of AIDS, many 
areas of Africa lack the necessary resources to help people living there cope 
with climate change. And the effects of global warming may act as a barrier to 
development and aggravate existing problems. At present, 200 million people 
(or 25 percent of the continent’s population) lack drinkable water. Climate 
change may boost this figure by another 75 to 200 million people over the next 
12 years. The IPCC projects that some countries could see a 50-percent drop 
in crop yields over the same period and a 90-percent drop in revenue from 
farming by the year 2100. (We look at how developing nations are affected by 
and are addressing global warming in Chapter 12.)
Asia
More people call Asia home than any other continent — 4 billion in all. This 
high population, combined with the fact that most of Asia’s countries are 
developing, means that a lot of people won’t be able to sufficiently adapt to 
climate change impacts. As in Africa, climate change may bring pressures to 
the continent that will slow down development.
The first concern is the future availability of drinkable water, which is already 
under pressure from population growth, pollution, and low or no sanitation. 
The IPCC projects that anywhere from 120 million to 1.2 billion people may 
find themselves without enough drinkable water within the next 42 years, 
depending on the severity of climate change. Already, rising temperatures 
are causing glaciers in the Himalayas, which supply water to 2 billion people, 
to melt. These disappearing glaciers are aggravating water shortages and will 
increase avalanches and flooding.
Rising sea levels will be a concern for coastal Asia. The IPCC reports that 
mangroves, coral reefs, and wetlands will be harmed by higher sea levels and 
warming water temperatures. On a brighter note, with rising saltwater intrud-
ing into fresh water, both fish that thrive in slightly salty water and the indus-
try that fishes them are expected to benefit. Unfortunately, this slightly salty 
water won’t be good for freshwater organisms, as a whole. (See Chapter 8 for 
more about the impact global warming will have on the oceans.)
Illnesses in Asia are also expected to rise because of global warming. Warmer 
seawater temperatures could also mean more, and more intense, cases of 
cholera. Scientists project that people in South and Southeast Asia will expe-
rience more cases of diarrheal disease, which can be fatal. (Chapter 9 offers 
more information about how global warming might increase disease.)
Australia & New Zealand
If you ask an Australian about global warming, you probably won’t get 
any argument about its negative effects. Australia has already experienced 

17
 Chapter 1: Global Warming Basics
increased heat waves, less snow, changes in rainfall, and more than seven 
years of persistent drought in four of its states. This heat and lack of precipi-
tation will likely worsen while global warming’s effects intensify. According 
to the IPCC, by 2030, water will be even scarcer in southern and eastern 
Australia and northern New Zealand than it currently is.
Climate change has also strongly affected the ocean. Sea levels have already 
risen 2.8 inches (70 millimeters) in Australia since the 1950s, and increasing 
ocean temperatures threaten the Great Barrier Reef. The reef is at risk of 
bleaching, and the possibility that it may be lost altogether is becoming more 
real. (See Chapter 8 for details.)
 
As in the United States and Canada, however, Australia and New Zealand may 
see some benefits from climate change. The IPCC reports that the countries 
may experience longer growing seasons, fewer occurrences of frost, and 
increased rainfall in some regions, which would benefit farming and forestry.
Small islands
You probably aren’t surprised to hear that when it comes to climate change, 
rising sea levels and more extreme storms create an enormous risk for small 
islands everywhere, such as the South Pacific island of Tuvalu. Some may 
simply disappear due to rising sea levels. If sea level rise does not inundate 
the islands, the impacts could still be severe:
 
 Forests vulnerable to major storms: Storms can easily topple island 
forests because a forest’s small area doesn’t provide much of a buffer 
(although some forests will expand because of warmer temperatures).
 
 Limited resources: Some islands can’t adapt physically and/or financially.
 
 Proximity of population to the ocean: At least 50 percent of island 
populations live within a mile (1.5 kilometers) of water, and these popu-
lations are threatened by rising sea levels.
 
 Risks to drinkable water: The intrusion of ocean saltwater because of 
rising sea levels could contaminate islands’ drinkable water, which is 
already limited on most islands.
 
 Reliance on tourism: Beach erosion and coral reef damage, two possible 
effects of climate change, would undermine tourism, which many islands 
rely on for their source of income.
 
 Vulnerable agriculture: Island agriculture, often a key part of the local 
economy, is extremely susceptible to harmful saltwater intrusions, as 
well as floods and droughts.

Par t I: Understanding Global Warming 
Polar regions
The planet’s polar regions are feeling climate change’s effects more intensely 
than anywhere else in the world. Warming temperatures are melting the ice 
and the permafrost that used to be solid ground.
The Arctic is home to many changes brought on by global warming, including 
the following:
 
 Lost traditions: Some indigenous people who make their homes in the 
Arctic are having to abandon their traditional ways of life. The Arctic 
ice and ecosystem are both core to many of these people’s cultures and 
livelihoods. For more on this issue, flip ahead to Chapter 9.
 
 Melting ice: The Greenland ice sheet is quickly melting, adding to sea 
level rise. Arctic ice is also steadily losing ice volume. All of this melting 
is diluting ocean waters, affecting ocean currents.
 
 New plant life: Greenery and new plants have been appearing in the 
Arctic in recent years. The tree line, which used to end about ¾ of the 
way up Canada and Russia, is shifting farther north, but the soil is not 
there to support a forest.
 
Some people look forward to the changes that the Arctic is experiencing. Now 
that so much sea ice has melted, ships can navigate the Arctic Ocean more effi-
ciently, taking shorter routes. Industrialists keenly anticipate being able to reach 
more fossil fuels below what used to be unreachable riches because of ice cover. 
Communities in the Arctic may be able to harness river flows that have been 
boosted or created by ice melt to run hydroelectric power. These short-term 
economic developments cannot outweigh the negative planetary impacts.
In the Antarctic, some scientists project major change because of global warm-
ing, thinking there’s a chance that the western Antarctic ice sheet might melt by 
the end of the 21st century. The western Antarctic ice sheet is simply enormous. 
It contains about 768,000 cubic miles (3.2 million cubic kilometers) of ice, about 
10 percent of the world’s total ice. It appears to be weakening because warmer 
water is eroding its base. Most scientists dispute the notion that the entire sheet 
will melt, and many scientists are still researching the situation. Nevertheless, 
parts of the western Antarctic ice sheet are definitely melting, even if the whole 
thing isn’t yet. The Greenland ice sheet is also melting — quickly. Both the 
western Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are adding to sea level rise.
The melting polar ice is also endangering many species, such as polar bears 
and penguins, which rely on the ice as a hunting ground. (Chapter 8 offers 
more information about the ways the polar animals are being affected by 
global warming.)

 Chapter 1: Global Warming Basics
Positive Politics: Governments 
and Global Warming
Governments are often the first institutions that the public looks to for big 
solutions. Governments represent the people of a region, after all, and are 
expected to make decisions for the good of the public. So, governments need 
to be able to respond to global warming effectively. Climate change is a very 
big problem for which no one has all the answers. Despite this challenge, 
governments around the world are willing to play their part — and it’s an 
important one.
Making a difference from city hall 
to the nation’s capital
All levels of government, from cities and towns, to states and provinces, to 
countries, have the ability to affect taxes and laws that can help in the fight 
against climate change:
 
 Local governments: Can implement and enforce city building codes, 
improve public transit systems, and implement full garbage, recycling, 
and composting programs.
 
 Regional governments: Can set fuel efficiency standards, establish taxes 
on carbon dioxide emissions, and set efficient building codes.
 
 Federal governments: Can lead on the largest of issues, such as subsi-
dizing renewable energy sources, removing subsidies from fossil-fuel 
energy sources, taxing carbon, and developing national programs for 
individuals who want to build low-emission housing. Federal govern-
ment can also set standards and mandatory targets for greenhouse gas 
reductions for industry, provinces, and states to follow.
The most effective governments work with each other — partnerships 
between cities, states, and countries exist around the world, supporting one 
another while they work on the same projects. To read more about what gov-
ernments can do and are already doing, check out Chapter 10.
Working with a global government
Countries must work together through global agreements to deal with, 
and conquer, a problem as urgent, complex, and wide-sweeping as climate 

20
Par t I: Understanding Global Warming 
change. Global agreements create a common level of understanding and 
allow countries to create collaborative goals, share resources, and work with 
each other towards global warming solutions. No one country can solve cli-
mate change on its own, just like no one country created global warming in 
the first place.
The core international law around climate change is the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its more detailed agreement, 
the Kyoto Protocol. Countries have agreed that by the end of 2012, they’ll 
have collectively reduced global greenhouse gas emissions by about a third 
of what they are today. Some countries have done their part, others have 
done little, and some have exceeded expectations. The international discus-
sions are ongoing; government representatives meet on an annual basis for 
the United Nations Climate Change Conference. We discuss just what goes on 
at those meetings in Chapter 11.
Helping developing countries
The effects of climate change are taking a particularly heavy toll on the popu-
lations of developing countries — countries with little or no industry develop-
ment and a weak or unstable economy. These countries, which are primarily 
located in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, have fewer financial resources to 
recover from events such as flooding, major storm damage, and crop failures. 
Money that these nations have to spend paying for the effects of global warm-
ing is money that they can’t spend building their economies.
Developing countries have little or no major industry development, for the 
most part (although China is now just overtaking the U.S. as the world’s 
largest polluter), so they don’t add many greenhouse gas emissions to the 
atmosphere. Even China, with its growing industry, lags far behind the emis-
sions of industrialized nations on a per-person basis. Because industrialized 
countries have been the primary greenhouse gas emitters, global consensus 
is that they’re firstly responsible for reducing emissions, and they can also 
play a role in helping developing countries shift to renewable energy sources 
and adapt to climate impacts. For more about how developing nations are 
addressing climate change, see Chapter 11.
Solving the Problem
Everyone can play a part in slowing down global warming, and humanity 
doesn’t have time to start small. Solving climate change requires a major 
commitment from everyone — from big business and industry to everyday 
people. Combined, these changes can make the necessary difference.

 Chapter 1: Global Warming Basics
Changing to alternative energies
Fossil fuels (see Chapter 4) are the primary source of the human-produced 
greenhouse gases causing global warming. Although they’ve fuelled more 
than a century of human progress, it’s time to leave them with the dinosaurs. 
Fortunately, a wide array of energies is waiting to take the place of oil, coal, 
and gas. Some of these energy sources aren’t yet ready for modern civiliza-
tion to use them on a grand scale, but if businesses and governments commit 
to developing these energies, they soon will be.
 
Here’s a list of renewable resources — energy that doesn’t run out, unlike fossil 
fuels, and doesn’t pump more carbon into the atmosphere:
 
 Geothermal: Jules Verne was wrong; the center of the planet doesn’t 
contain another world, but it does have plenty of heat. People can use 
that heat to boil water to produce steam that propels turbines and gen-
erates electricity. Even areas without geo-heat sources to boil water can 
heat homes through geothermal energy (the warmth of the earth).
 
 Hydro: People can harness hydropower, or water power, to turn turbines 
and create electricity.
 
 Solar: Humanity can use the sun’s warmth in a few ways. Solar cells, like 
you see on some roofs, can convert sunlight to electricity. People can 
also heat buildings and water with the sun’s direct heat.
 
 Waste: Garbage is more than just trash. It offers astounding possibilities. 
People can harness the methane emitted from dumps, burn the byprod-
ucts of agriculture as fuel, and even use old frying oil as a type of diesel.
 
 Wind: Remember that pinwheel you had as a kid? Giant versions of 
those wheels are popping up all over the world as wind turbines, gener-
ating clean electricity for homes, businesses, and entire energy grids.
Feeling charged up? Check out Chapter 13 to further explore the renewable-
energy possibilities.
Getting down to business
Industries are the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and 
they can make the biggest contributions to the fight against global warming. 
Although some of the changes that businesses can make may have an initial 
impact on the businesses’ pocketbooks, many of those changes might even 
save businesses money in the long run.

22
Par t I: Understanding Global Warming 
Industrial-strength solutions
The greatest immediate change businesses and industries can make is to 
improve their efficiency. Companies waste a lot of energy powering anti-
quated equipment, heating poorly insulated buildings, and throwing out 
materials that they could recycle. Chapter 14 details some of the ways that 
companies can pull up their socks and make smarter use of energy, and it 
also shares some impressive success stories.
Ideally, renewable energy will ultimately power industry. Unfortunately, 
much of the energy that industry uses still comes from fossil fuels for the 
time being; not all the alternative energies that we describe in the section 
“Changing to alternative energies,” earlier in this chapter, are mature enough 
to power major factories. However, industry doesn’t need to pump the green-
house gas emissions from those fossil fuels into the air. Currently, some 
scientists and industries are storing carbon emissions underground. This 
solution is controversial, however. We consider the issue in Chapter 13.
Green fixes for forestry and farming
The forestry and agriculture industries can do more than just cut back on 
their greenhouse gas emissions; they can actually increase the amount of 
carbon that’s absorbed from the planet’s atmosphere. (See Chapter 2 to take 
a ride on the carbon cycle and understand the critical role that plants play in 
keeping Earth livable.)
 
Around the world, forests are being cut down, removing valuable carbon sinks, 
which absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Where they harvest trees, log-
ging companies need to explore methods other than clear-cutting; selectively 
harvesting trees enables forests to continue to thrive. In other countries, 
particularly in South America, people are clearing forests for farmland. Losing 
those forests is particularly costly for the atmosphere because, unlike forests 
in more temperate climates, these rainforests absorb carbon year-round. 
Deforestation methods have to change.
Farming’s solution for global warming is dirty — or how dirt is treated. 
Believe it or not, a simple action like excessively tilling the land causes carbon 
to be released into the atmosphere. And when farmers add greenhouse gas–
laden fertilizers to the soil, they release even more emissions. By cutting back 
on tilling the land and using less fertilizer, farmers can be a potent part of the 
solution to climate change.
Making it personal
You’re a vital part of the climate change solution, too. As a citizen, you can 
ensure that governments recognize the importance of global warming and 

23
 Chapter 1: Global Warming Basics
follow through on their promises. As a consumer, you can support companies 
that are making the biggest strides in fighting climate change and encour-
age other companies to make reducing greenhouse gases a priority. If you’re 
really passionate about having your voice heard, you might even want to con-
sider joining a group dedicated to spreading the word about global warming. 
We tell you how you can get involved in Chapter 15.
 
You can also make many changes in your daily life — some that seem small, 
some less so — that cut back on the carbon emissions for which you’re 
responsible. You’re probably already familiar with many of the little steps you 
can take to be more climate friendly:
 
 Making your home more energy efficient: Better insulate your roof, 
basement, and walls; seal your windows; and replace your old light 
bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs.
 
 Reducing the amount of garbage you produce: Take a reusable bag 
with you when you shop, buy unpackaged goods, and recycle and reuse 
materials.
 
 Using energy wisely: Turn off lights and appliances when you’re not 
using them, use the air conditioner less in the summer, and turn down 
the heat in the winter.
Did you know that many of your appliances are gobbling electricity, causing 
the emission of greenhouse gases, even when those appliances are turned off? 
Or that putting a lid on pots on your stove makes your food cook more effi-
ciently? Chapter 18 offers all sorts of tidbits on how you can go green easily.
Not every action that you can take to cut back on your greenhouse gas emis-
sions is manageable — not everyone can buy a hybrid car (which we consider 
in Chapter 17) or build a home that doesn’t rely on major power producers for 
energy (see Chapter 18) yet. But, hopefully, we suggest some options in this 
book that fit your situation and can help you to make a difference.
Global warming affects everyone, and everyone can play an important role 
in stopping it. Forget the doom and gloom you may hear on the news — start 
thinking about the exciting opportunities you have to make a change.

hen you watch the news or read the papers, you probably hear a lot 
about the greenhouse effect and greenhouse gases. What you’ve read 
or seen might make you think that the greenhouse effect and greenhouse 
gases are all bad.
In fact, greenhouse gases have long been the good guys. They’re necessary 
for life on Earth. When it comes to humanity’s survival (and the survival of 
everything else on Earth), humans need their home planet to be like the por-
ridge in Goldilocks and the Three Bears: not too hot or too cold, but just right. 
A planet with too few greenhouse gases would be too cold; an atmosphere 
with a lot of greenhouse gases traps too much heat.
Greenhouse gases become a problem only when the atmosphere contains too 
much of them, which is happening today. Our industries and our farms, even 
our garbage dumps, are pumping out an array of gases — carbon dioxide, 
methane, nitrous oxide, and a host of other substances. Humanity has knocked 
off kilter the life-preserving cycle that makes sure the Earth’s atmosphere has 
just enough carbon dioxide, the star greenhouse gas.
The Greenhouse Effect 101
If you want to understand the greenhouse effect, the best place to start is 
with the object that gave us this analogy in the first place, the greenhouse. A 
greenhouse works by letting in sunlight, which plants and soil absorb, thus 
heating up the greenhouse. The panes of glass ensure that the warmer air 
doesn’t escape the greenhouse, or does so very slowly. If you’ve ever parked 
your car with the windows rolled up on a sunny day, you’ve experienced this 
effect. When you open your car door, you’re hit with a blast of hot air. The 

26
Par t I: Understanding Global Warming 
windows of your car have acted like the panes in a greenhouse, letting sun-
light in, which heats the car, and then trapping that heat.
Certain gases in our atmosphere trap the sun’s heat in a similar way. These 
particular gases are called greenhouse gases because they cause this green-
house effect. The Earth is bombarded by radiation from the sun. Some of this 
radiation can be seen (think visible light), and some of it can’t be (ultraviolet 
light, for example).
 
Very hot bodies give off different amounts of energy than cold ones do. A basic 
law of physics says that everything gives off radiative (mostly heat or light) 
energy, and how much energy it emits depends on its temperature. The sun, 
for example, is a toasty 10,300 degrees Fahrenheit (5,700 degrees Celsius) — a 
little bit hotter than people are used to here on Earth. So, the sun gives off a 
lot of radiative energy, and the Earth gives off very little. Earth is warm mostly 
because of the heat it gets from the sun — most of the sun’s radiative energy 
actually zooms right through the atmosphere to the Earth’s surface. (The 
helpful high level ozone layer protects us by absorbing a lot of the harmful 
ultraviolet rays.)
A portion of this radiation, about 30 percent on average, bounces off clouds, 
ice, snow, deserts, and other bright surfaces, which reflect the sun’s rays 
back into outer space. The other 70 percent is absorbed by land or water, 
which then heats up. And the Earth emits some of that heat — in the form of 
infrared radiation (electromagnetic waves most commonly known as heat). 
The unique qualities of the greenhouse gases come into play: The green-
house gases absorb some of the escaping infrared radiation in the lower 
atmosphere, warming the Earth, thus creating the greenhouse effect.
So, less of the radiation from the Earth’s surface gets to outer space than it 
would have without those gases, and that energy remains in the atmosphere 
and returns to the Earth’s surface — making both the atmosphere and Earth 
itself warmer than they would be otherwise.
To see the greenhouse effect in action, take a look at Figure 2-1.
If the planet had no atmosphere or greenhouse gases, humanity would be 
left out in the cold. The Earth wouldn’t be able to keep any of the heat that 
it gets from sun. Thanks to greenhouse gases, humanity is kept reasonably 
warm, enjoying an average temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees 
Celsius), some 62.6 to 64.4 degrees Fahrenheit (17 to 18 degrees Celsius) 
warmer than without greenhouse gases.
 
This natural greenhouse effect and the ozone layer allow life to exist on Earth. 
Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth would be too cold. And without the 
ozone layer, life couldn’t survive the sun’s ultraviolet radiation.

Too much greenhouse gas turns the heat up beyond that to which societies 
and ecosystems have become adjusted. The atmosphere on the planet Venus 
is 96 percent carbon dioxide (the key greenhouse gas that we talk about in 
the following section). Because of Venus’s excessive amount of greenhouse 
gases, that cloudy molten planet experiences surface temperatures of up to 
500 degrees Celsius. The atmosphere on Mars has 95 percent carbon dioxide 
but is very thin, and the planet’s position is farther away from the sun than 
Earth — leaving it at a brisk –80 degrees Fahrenheit (–60 degrees Celsius).
Carbon Dioxide: Leader of the Pack
Earth’s atmosphere contains 24 different greenhouse gases, but just one of 
them accounts for the overwhelming majority of the effect: carbon dioxide 
(or CO2, for short). This gas accounts for about 63 percent of the greenhouse 
gas warming effect in the long run. (In the short term, over the last 5 years, it 
has accounted for 91 percent. See Table 2-1 for more on the intensity of gases 
over time.) If you’re itching to know about the other 37 percent of green-
house warming, check out the section “Looking at the Other Greenhouse 
Gases,” later in this chapter.

28
Par t I: Understanding Global Warming 
 
Water vapor, not carbon dioxide, is technically the greenhouse gas with the 
biggest impact. Human activities do not directly affect in a significant way 
water vapor in the atmosphere. For more about water vapor, see the section, 
“Looking at the Other Greenhouse Gases,” later in this chapter.
Given the important role that carbon dioxide plays in warming the Earth, you 
may be surprised by how little of it is in the atmosphere.
 
In fact, 99.95 percent of the air we breathe (not including water vapor) is made 
up of
 
 Nitrogen: 78 percent
 
 Oxygen: 21 percent
 
 Argon: 0.95 percent
Carbon dioxide, by contrast, currently makes up only 0.0385 percent of all 
the air in the atmosphere. Human activities have helped increase that con-
centration from pre-industrial times, when it was about 0.0280 percent.
When scientists talk about air quality and the atmosphere, they often use the 
term parts per million (ppm). So, out of every million parts of air, only 385 
are carbon dioxide. That’s not much carbon dioxide, but what a difference it 
makes! It’s like the hot pepper you put into a huge pot of chili — this stuff is 
literally the spice of life, and just a pinch will do ya! And, like the pepper in 
the chili, if you have too much, watch out.
Looking at the carbon cycle
Carbon dioxide occurs naturally — in fact, you produce some every time 
you exhale. You inhale oxygen (and other gases), which your body uses as a 
nutrient, and you breathe out what your body doesn’t need, including carbon 
dioxide. You aren’t alone in using this process. Every animal and insect on 
Earth that breathes in air exhales carbon dioxide. But a lot of organisms, 
most of them plants, suck carbon dioxide out of the air. Trees, for example, 
take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen — the complete opposite of what 
people do.
The carbon cycle is the natural system that, ideally, creates a balance 
between carbon emitters (such as humans) and carbon absorbers (such as 
trees), so the atmosphere doesn’t contain an increasing amount of carbon 
dioxide. It’s a huge process that involves oceans, land, and air. Life as we 
know it — from microscopic bugs in the oceans to you and me, and every 
fern in between — would disappear without it. You can think of the carbon 
cycle almost as the Earth breathing in and out.

29
 Chapter 2: The Greenhouse We Live In
 
The carbon cycle is called “in balance” when roughly the same amount of 
carbon that’s being pumped into the air is being sucked out by something 
else. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide was at a concentration 
of 280 ppm — carbon dioxide concentrations have fluctuated up and down, 
but 280 ppm has been about the highest recorded concentration for the past 
800,000 years — until humans started to distort it. (We look at how humans 
contribute carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in Part II.)
When trees take up carbon through photosynthesis, they’re called carbon 
sinks. Plants aren’t the only carbon sinks, however. Figure 2-2 shows how 
the ocean, plants, and soil all act as carbon sinks, removing carbon from the 
atmosphere. They also store, or sequester, carbon, and they store the carbon 
in a carbon reservoir. For example, the ocean holds about 38,000 billion 
metric tons of carbon in its reservoir.
Under the deep blue sea
The ocean is the biggest carbon sink on Earth. So far, it has tucked away 
about 86 percent of all the carbon dioxide in the world. If that gas was in the 
atmosphere, not underwater, the world would be a lot hotter.
The exchange of carbon dioxide between the ocean and the air happens at 
the surface of the water. When air mixes with the surface of the ocean, the 
ocean absorbs carbon dioxide because carbon dioxide is soluble in water 
(that is, carbon dioxide can be absorbed by water). And, in fact, the seas’ 
ability to absorb carbon dioxide is referred to as the solubility pump because 
it functions like a pump, drawing carbon dioxide out of the air and storing it 
in the ocean.
The ocean also acts as a biological pump to remove carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere. Plants close to the surface of the ocean take in carbon dioxide 
from the air and give off oxygen, just like plants on land. (We discuss this pro-
cess, known as photosynthesis, and the role that plants play in the carbon 
cycle in the following section.) Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that live 
A recipe that gives you gas
Carbon dioxide is composed of one carbon atom 
and two oxygen atoms, connected by double 
bonds. Present in our atmosphere as an odor-
less, colorless gas, it can also exist in solid form 
(think dry ice) and, when kept under pressure, in 
liquid form (the bubbles you see in champagne 
are carbon dioxide escaping after you uncork 
the bottle and remove the pressure).

30
Par t I: Understanding Global Warming 
in water. You may know them as algae, most commonly seen as the greenish 
clumpy plants that float around on ponds and other water. Phytoplankton have 
short but useful lives. If other organisms don’t eat them, they simply die within 
just a few days. They then sink to the ocean floor, mix into the sediment, and 
decay. The carbon dioxide that these plants absorb during their brief lives is 
well and truly sequestered after their little plant bodies are buried.
Each year, the oceans put away about another 2 billion metric tons of carbon 
dioxide. Figure 2-3 demonstrates how the ocean interacts within the carbon 
cycle.

Why people couldn’t survive without plants
You may not have realized back in the third grade that when you were read-
ing about photosynthesis, you were actually getting the basics of modern cli-
mate science. (Photosynthesis occurs when plants take in energy from the sun 
and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into oxygen and sugars.)

Basic photosynthesis
Trees are our planet’s biggest and most widespread plants. Our forests are 
wonderful carbon sinks.
 
The most effective carbon-trapping forests are tropical, such as those in Brazil 
and other South American countries. Most tropical forests are called rainfor-
ests (although not all rainforests are tropical). Rainforests grow in regions that 
get over 70.9 inches of rain each year. Because of all the rain they get, these 
dense, rich forests are full of biodiversity. And because of the tropical climate, 
which is always warm, these tropical forests work year-round. The tireless 
work that these trees do to sequester carbon is just one of the reasons to pro-
tect the tropical rainforests
Forests in Canada, the United States, and Russia aren’t as effective at soaking 
up carbon because they take a rest in the winter but are still very important 
in the planet’s carbon balance. The northern forests make up for the real-
ity of their seasonal work, through the relatively richer and deeper soils. 
Northern forests store more carbon in carbon reservoirs, even though tropi-
cal forests take up more carbon on an annual basis.

33
 Chapter 2: The Greenhouse We Live In
Down to earth
Not just the trees and oceans store carbon; soil does, too. Plants draw in 
carbon dioxide and break it down into carbon, breathing the leftover oxygen 
into the atmosphere. The carbon makes its way into the soil through the 
plants’ root systems or when the plant dies. See Figure 2-5 for a diagram 
showing how soil and trees exchange carbon dioxide with the air.
 
In this plant–soil relationship, most of the carbon is stored close to the top 
of the soil. Tilling the soil (mixing it up) exposes the carbon in the ground to 
the oxygen in the air, and these two elements immediately join to form carbon 
dioxide.

Par t I: Understanding Global Warming 
All together, vegetation and soil store about a billion metric tons of carbon 
every year, and another 1.6 billion metric tons move in and out between the 
land and the air. So far, the plants and soil have packed away 2,300 billion 
metric tons.
Investigating our impact 
on the carbon cycle
A lot of the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is natural (you’re breathing 
some out, right now), but human activities also contribute plenty of the gas 
(we discuss these activities in Part II). Historically, the carbon dioxide that 
people put into the air was pretty much soaked up by the carbon sinks, and 
the amount of carbon dioxide that was around before people started building 
factories had been fairly steady since the beginning of human civilization.
Producing industrial amounts of carbon dioxide
Since the Industrial Revolution went into full swing around 1850, the amount 
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has risen drastically. Due to burn-
ing fossil fuels, as well as clearing forests, people have almost doubled the 
carbon dioxide emissions in just over a century, and today, carbon dioxide 
levels are higher than they have ever been in recorded history (see Chapter 
4 for more about fossil fuels). In fact, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are 
higher today — more than @@bf1/3 higher — than at any time in the past 800,000 
years. (Carbon dioxide levels were much higher millions of years ago, how-
ever. We talk about the history of carbon dioxide levels in greater detail in 
Chapter 3.)
Carbon dioxide concentration levels are currently at about 385 ppm, and 
they rose at an average of 2 ppm per year between 2000 and 2007 because 
of increasing emissions due to human actions. On average, in the 1980s, 
globally, people put 7.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions into 
the air every year — and those emissions have been increasing every year. 
So many people are using so much energy, mostly in industrialized coun-
tries, that the amount of carbon that is being put into the air is knocking the 
carbon cycle off balance.
Plugging up the carbon sinks
The Earth’s carbon sinks, which used to be able to handle everything oxygen-
breathing creatures could throw at them, are not able to keep up with 
humanity’s increased carbon dioxide production. Studies presented through 
IPCC reports suggest a bunch of different possible consequences, ranging 
from a theory that new plants might appear that can soak up more carbon 

35
 Chapter 2: The Greenhouse We Live In
dioxide to the idea that carbon sinks may become full and may no longer be 
able to absorb any more carbon dioxide. Like anyone who works overtime, 
carbon sinks could become weaker as they soak up more carbon dioxide. 
The ocean has stored carbon effectively in the past, but global warm-
ing might be causing the oceans to do just the opposite. The oceans have 
warmed 0.18 degrees Fahrenheit (0.1 degrees Celsius) on average in recent 
years, and carbon dioxide is less soluble in warm water. The oceans push the 
carbon dioxide that they can’t dissolve into the air, instead. Data collected 
during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that both land and ocean sinks seemed 
to have kept up with growing emissions. However, more recent studies show 
that the carbon dioxide intake of some sinks, such as trees, is slowing down.
 
Sinks normally absorb about half of our emissions. So, if these sinks were to 
weaken, or even stop absorbing, they’d leave a lot more carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere, on top of our already-increasing emissions.
 
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which traps heat in the atmosphere. 
Higher levels of carbon dioxide are causing higher average temperatures.
Looking at the Other Greenhouse Gases
Carbon dioxide may get all the press, but 23 other greenhouse gases (in five 
main groups) also heat things up. Although they’re present in much smaller 
amounts, these guys are actually far more potent, molecule for molecule, in 
terms of greenhouse effect. You might think of them as carbon dioxide on 
steroids. Table 2-1 shows you the power of some of these gases.
Because so many different types of greenhouse gases exist, people usually 
either talk about only carbon dioxide (because so much more of it exists than 
the others) or greenhouse gases in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents — how 
small an amount of the gas you’d have to put into the atmosphere to have 
the same warming impact as the current level of carbon dioxide. Referring to 
all greenhouse gases with this measurement makes assessing and measur-
ing them that much easier. So, when we say greenhouse gas in this book, you 
can actually think of it as carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. No calculator 
needed.
 
Measuring in carbon equivalents means, for example, that 1 unit of methane 
equals 21 units of carbon. In other words, 1 metric ton of methane is just as 
bad as 21 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Thus, methane is 21 carbon dioxide 
equivalents, or 21 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

Methane (CH4)
Methane accounts for about 18.6 percent of the overall global warming effect 
from greenhouse gases, according to the World Meteorological Organization. 
Svante Arrhenius: Early climate change scientist
Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius was the first 
person to predict what the future atmosphere 
might look like in the wake of the Industrial 
Revolution.
He spent many of his days (and likely nights) at 
the end of the nineteenth century calculating 
how the carbon released by burning coal (the 
major source of fuel at the time) might actually 
change the atmospheric carbon balance. In the 
end, he calculated that humanity could double 
the concentration of atmospheric carbon — in 
3,000 years.
The fact that Earth is now closing in on doubling 
that concentration just over 100 years after 
Arrhenius made his calculations has nothing 
to do with his grasp of chemistry or math — it 
has everything to do with the fact that he based 
estimates on what he knew.
The internal combustion engine was only a 
speculative invention, with none in use. No 
cars were on the road, and Arrhenius certainly 
had no idea about traffic jams, drive-through 
windows, or airplanes. Who could have imag-
ined today’s level of fossil-fuel consumption 100 
years ago? After all, Arrhenius was a chemist, 
not Nostradamus!

37
 Chapter 2: The Greenhouse We Live In
It’s also 21 to 56 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Methane is to 
carbon dioxide what an espresso shot is to herbal tea. (See Table 2-1.)
Methane naturally occurs when organic materials, such as plant and animal 
wastes, break down in an anaerobic environment (an environment that con-
tains no oxygen and includes the right mix of microbes and temperature). 
This breakdown creates methane, along with small amounts of other gases. 
The stomach of a cow, a landfill site, and a marsh are all prime examples of 
methane-producing environments.
Methane occurs naturally, but humans also add their fair share (okay, we’re 
just being modest — humans add a lot). People contribute to the amount of 
methane when their garbage decomposes in landfills, and livestock contributes 
thanks to their flatulence (and maybe bad breath; expert opinion is mixed).
How methane gets into the atmosphere
Two-thirds of all the human-made methane comes from agriculture, and 
about half of that amount comes from rice crops. If you’ve ever seen rice 
being grown, you may remember that it’s planted in a flooded field. Any dead 
organic matter falls to the bottom of the paddy, which is a perfect airless 
environment for creating methane.
All our cows, pigs, chickens, and other farm animals account for the rest. The 
food breaking down in their stomachs produces methane that they, shall we 
say, emit into the air — one way or another. All animals emit methane — yes, 
even you — but livestock’s methane causes a problem because there are 
so many of these fairly big animals (with multiple stomachs — those would 
come in handy for extra slices of chocolate cheesecake . . .).
Humans also add methane to the atmosphere through treating wastewater 
and from landfills — all that garbage spews methane into the air while it 
breaks down.
People also use methane as a fuel. Natural gas is 90 to 95 percent methane, 
and when natural gas is extracted from the ground, some methane escapes 
into the air. (Read more about using natural gas as a fuel in Chapter 4.)
The mystery of stabilizing methane levels
 
Methane levels in the atmosphere seem to have stabilized at 1.8 parts per 
million, even though people keep dumping garbage, growing rice, and raising 
cattle. The experts haven’t quite figured out why methane levels seem stable 
currently because methane production hasn’t decreased noticeably, aside 
from a drop in rice crops in China.
 
Although methane level increases appear to have declined since the 1990s and 
have been nearly stable since then, this stability probably won’t last. A lot of 
methane is frozen into the ground of the arctic, trapped by the permafrost. 

38
Par t I: Understanding Global Warming 
Rising northern temperatures, however, are melting the soil. When the Arctic 
land thaws, it becomes swampland — and it starts dishing out methane like 
hotcakes. We look at this problem in greater detail in Chapter 7.
Nitrous Oxide (N2O)
The amount of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere is even smaller than the 
amount of methane, but it accounts for about 6.2 percent of the overall green-
house effect. The greenhouse effect of nitrous oxide (N2O) per unit is almost 
300 times more potent than that of carbon dioxide.
Unlike methane, this gas is actually still going up at a rate of 1 part per billion 
(ppb) each year — as of 2005, it was at 319 parts per billion.
Ocean- and soil-dwelling bacteria produce nitrous oxide naturally as a waste 
product. In agriculture, farmers encourage those natural bacteria to produce 
more of the gas through soil cultivation and the use of natural and artificial 
nitrogen fertilizers.
Dentists also use nitrous oxide as an anesthetic. (Laughing gas is nitrous 
oxide — not so funny now, is it? Though it’s in such small amounts that 
you don’t need to worry about your root canal adding to global warming.) 
Industrial processes (to create nylon, for example) produce nitrous oxide.
The biggest source of nitrous oxide, natural or human-made, is fertilizers 
used in agriculture. Fertilizers count for 60 percent of human-made sources 
and 40 percent of sources overall. Humans also add a lot of nitrous oxide to 
the atmosphere by using automobiles. Ironically, cars produce the gas as 
a side result of solving another environmental problem — see the sidebar 
“How good intentions increased nitrous oxide emissions,” in this chapter, for 
the scoop.
Hexafluoro-what?
Hydrofluorocarbons. Perfluorocarbons. Sulfur hexafluoride. Try saying those 
names three times fast. They’re as hard to say as they are effective at trap-
ping heat. These three types of gases are all human-made and don’t exist 
naturally in the atmosphere. They come from a number of different industrial 
processes that create air pollution.
Almost all car air-conditioning systems use the 13 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). 
(We look at how industry emits these greenhouse gases in detail in Chapter 5.) 
Most of the seven perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are byproducts of the aluminum 
industry. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) comes from producing magnesium, and 
many types of industry use it in insulating major electrical equipment.

39
 Chapter 2: The Greenhouse We Live In
Other players on the greenhouse gas bench
The two greenhouse gases that we talk about in the following sections do 
play a role in climate change, but they aren’t on the United Nations list of 24 
greenhouse gases and get left aside in most discussions about the impact 
of greenhouse gases on global warming — not for scientific reasons, but 
because of decisions made in international negotiations.
Water vapor
As we talk about earlier in this chapter, water vapor is a huge player in the 
greenhouse effect. As shocking as it may seem, good ol’ H2O (two parts 
hydrogen, one part water) causes the majority — 60 percent — of the plan-
et’s warming.
Unlike the production of the other greenhouse gases, humans don’t directly 
cause the increase of water vapor. But the other gases that are produced 
heat up the atmosphere. When plants, soil, and water warm up, more water 
evaporates from their surfaces and ends up in the atmosphere as water 
vapor. A warmer atmosphere can absorb more moisture. The atmosphere 
will continue to absorb more moisture while temperatures continue to rise. 
See Figure 2-6.
 
Water vapor also differs greatly from other greenhouse gases because the 
atmosphere can hold only so much of it. If you’ve ever watched a weather 
forecast, you’ve heard the term relative humidity, which refers to the amount 
of water vapor currently in the atmosphere compared to how much the atmo-
sphere can hold. On a really hot and sticky day, the relative humidity may be 
90 percent — the atmosphere has just about taken in all the water vapor it 
can. When the relative humidity reaches 100 percent, clouds form, and then 
precipitation falls, releasing the water from the air.
How good intentions increased 
nitrous oxide emissions
Fossil fuels (which we discuss in greater detail 
in Chapter 4) contain nitrogen. When cars 
burn gasoline, they give off the nitrogen-based 
chemicals nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2) — together known as NOx gases. 
These NOx gases create acid rain and smog in 
cities.
In response to these environmental problems, 
governments in North America forced car 
companies to put catalytic converters in all their 
cars. Catalytic converters convert smog-causing 
chemicals into other chemicals that aren’t as 
damaging to our lungs and don’t cause acid rain.
Unfortunately, these catalytic converters turn 
NOx gases, which don’t have an effect on cli-
mate change, into nitrous oxide (N2O), which 
does! (One more reason, if you need it, why 
everyone should drive less.)

Running up emissions with your sneakers
Some of the sources of these gases are really 
wild. Here’s one: Nike came out with the popular 
Nike Air shoe, a running shoe with a cool little 
air-filled bubble in the heel, in the late ’80s. That 
bubble was filled with — you guessed it — a 
greenhouse gas! (Sulfur hexafluoride, to be 
exact.)
The amount of greenhouse gas in those shoes 
all together added an equivalent of about 7 
million metric tons of carbon dioxide — or the 
emissions from 1 million cars — into the air 
when they hit the garbage dump after being 
worn out. In the summer of 2006, after 14 years 
of research and pressure from environmental 
groups, Nike stopped using the greenhouse gas 
in shoes and replaced it with nitrogen. We’re 
glad that bubble burst.

41
 Chapter 2: The Greenhouse We Live In
Ozone depleters
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are also considered greenhouse gases, respon-
sible for about 12 percent of the greenhouse effect the planet is experiencing 
today. You don’t find much of these CFC gases around anymore because the 
Montreal Protocol of 1989 required countries to discontinue their use. CFCs 
break down the ozone — the layer throughout the stratosphere that inter-
cepts the sun’s most deadly rays. (Without the ozone layer, the sun’s ultravi-
olet rays would kill all living things.) CFCs were mostly used in aerosol spray 
cans and the cooling liquids in fridges and air conditioning.
 
Because CFCs are already regulated under the Montreal Protocol, they’re not 
regulated under the Kyoto Protocol, the agreement to reduce greenhouse 
gases that became active in 2005. (Read more about what gases are covered 
under the Kyoto Protocol in Chapter 11.)

 Limiting greenhouse gas emissions
T
he greenhouse gases that are emitted when humans burn fossil fuels are 
causing global warming. No other theory explains the climate changes 
that scientists are observing.
That’s right — global warming is a theory. A scientific theory is based on a 
set of principles that describe a particular phenomenon — like the theory of 
gravity. Theories aren’t technically facts, but sometimes theories become so 
strong that people accept them as facts. But how do you know this theory is 
correct? Can you really trust all those bigwig scientists? And if it’s correct, 
what does this theory suggest is going to happen next? We answer those 
questions in this chapter.
Considering Causes of Global Warming 
Other than Greenhouse Gases
Sure, some uncertainty exists around how much of the planet’s warming is 
due to natural effects and how much of it is due to human activity. When it 
comes to the culprits behind climate change, greenhouse gases, although 
important, aren’t the only players.
The climate is an incredibly complex system affected by the sun, cloud cover, 
and complex long-term trends. Because of this complexity, various theories 
in science — other than the main one about greenhouse gas emissions — 
may at least partially account for global warming.

44
Part I: Understanding Global Warming 
 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that the idea 
that climate change is being caused by natural changes alone has a 5-percent 
chance of being true, and that the idea that increasing carbon dioxide levels 
due to human activity are at least partly behind climate change has a 95-percent 
chance of being true. So, although some uncertainty exists, the debate is 
largely settled.
Solar cycles
The sun has different cycles, and the Earth’s climate changes over time in 
response to these cycles. The sun goes through irradiance cycles, which is 
when the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth varies. Scientists only 
found out about these cycles recently. Two of these cycles seem to exist, one 
running for 11 years and the other running for 22 years. Scientists don’t yet 
know whether the sun goes through other, longer irradiation cycles — these 
unknown cycles might, in part, cause climate change.
The solar cycles do affect climate in the short term, but the U.S. National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports that the impact 
from the light intensity of the sun versus the impact from greenhouse gas 
emissions is a ratio of approximately 9 to 40. So, greenhouse gases have more 
than four times the effect of solar cycles.
Other cycles that concern the sun are the Milankovitch cycles. Although 
they sound like Mr. Milankovitch’s bike collection, Milankovitch cycles are 
actually natural cycles of the Earth — one of these cycles, for example, is 
the way in which the planet tilts towards or away from the sun. These cycles 
may explain the glacial cycles — the ins and outs of ice ages. (We talk about 
the Milankovitch cycles in more detail in the section “Making the Case for 
Carbon,” later in this chapter.)
Although they’re very important, the Milankovitch cycles have minimal 
effect on climate, in comparison to the effects from greenhouse gas emis-
sions, when you look at them in terms of relatively short timescales — from 
decades to centuries. Overall, the IPCC says that the sun likely has little to do 
with global average temperature rises since 1950. In fact, models suggest that 
the Earth would be cooling if not for increases in greenhouse gases.
Cloud cover
Scientists have known for a long time that climate affects rainfall. NASA (the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the U.S.) has shown that the 

45
 Chapter 3: The Big Deal about Carbon
relationship may work in reverse, however — that the changing rain patterns 
might, in turn, indirectly affect global warming. Rainfall patterns correspond 
to cloud cover. Depending on their thickness and shape, clouds can reflect 
light during the day and hold in surface heat overnight. (See Figure 3-1.) The 
amount of water vapor in the air has recently increased (which we talk about 
in Chapter 2), which means more clouds, which means more rainfall. This 
increase in cloud cover might help explain why nighttime temperatures are 
rising more than daytime temperatures in global warming trends. It gives a 
whole new meaning to having a hot night!

Ultimately, however, increased cloud cover seems to be a result, not a cause, 
of climate change. But, like the increased water vapor, it may further 
aggravate global warming.

46
Part I: Understanding Global Warming 
Long-term climate trends
Over the course of many millions of years, the Earth’s temperature has varied 
widely. The latest change in temperature may be entirely in keeping with that 
variation — but it’s unlikely. Scientists know that the current period of ice 
ages started about 2 million years ago, and since 800,000 years ago, the planet 
started into a cycle of an ice age every 100,000 years or so. Currently, the Earth 
is in an interglacial period — meaning the weather is warm and stable enough 
that humans can develop and expand societies. Human civilization started 
at the beginning of this interglacial period about 10,000 years ago. Given that 
past warm interglacial periods lasted about 10,000 years, on average, scientists 
would expect the world to be getting cooler, not warmer. In fact, it appears 
that this cooling was happening between the middle ages and the 19th century 
(the little ice age), but then came the Industrial Revolution.
El Niño: Global warming cause, effect, or both?
El Niño is a natural weather cycle that has the 
power to change global temperatures. It’s been 
around for hundreds — possibly millions — of 
years. El Niño involves the tropical Pacific Ocean 
warming by 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit (0.5 degrees 
Celsius) or more for about three months at a 
time. This warmed water eventually loses that 
heat to the atmosphere, causing the average air 
temperature (at the surface, or where human-
ity lives in the lower part of the atmosphere) to 
go up a few months later, which then alters the 
overall climate temporarily. The temperature of 
the ocean then settles back down to normal and 
returns to its regular cycle of ups and downs.
Scientists don’t yet know whether global warm-
ing is affecting these cycles, but global warming 
and El Niño cycles are very interrelated. Part of 
the reason scientists can’t distinguish between 
the impacts of global warming and El Niño 
on climate is because they’re so linked, and 
they both influence many different aspects of 
regional climate, that they can actually change 
one another. A computer model giving future 
scenarios of climate that includes both El Niño 
and global warming doesn’t yet exist because 
of the difficulty that exists between identifying 
the separations between the two.
Some models say El Niño will become stronger, 
but others say it’ll weaken. Evidence suggests 
that El Niño cycles have been stronger and hap-
pening more often over the past few decades, 
and climate models project that climate change 
will cause sea-surface temperatures to rise in 
the tropical Pacific Ocean — similar to El Niño 
conditions. Scientists are working constantly to 
advance their understanding of the relationship 
between climate change and El Niño.
Two unknown questions remain: How much 
temperature rise is the result of El Niño and 
how much is the result of global warming? Are 
El Niño temperatures any higher because of 
global warming?

47
 Chapter 3: The Big Deal about Carbon
Making the Case for Carbon
Scientists have collected evidence that points to the build-up of carbon dioxide 
in the Earth’s atmosphere as the most likely cause of climate change.
They can measure exactly how much carbon dioxide has been in the Earth’s 
atmosphere historically. Climatologists (scientists specializing in climate science) 
have drilled deep — as deep as 2 miles (3 kilometers) — into ancient ice in 
places such as Antarctica and Greenland. They’ve pulled up ice cores — long, 
thin samples of many layers of ice that has been packed down over thousands 
of years, which look like really (really) long pool noodles. (Figure 3-2 shows two 
scientists drilling for an ice core sample.) When the layers are clearly visible, the 
ice core looks like a pool noodle with horizontal stripes.
Scientists can date an ice core by counting the layers of ice — just like you 
can tell the age of a tree by counting its rings. The layers of ice tell them 
exactly when the ice was formed. Each layer of ice includes little pockets of 
trapped air. These frozen air bubbles are like time capsules of the ancient 
atmosphere. They’re full of gas, including carbon dioxide, that has been 
trapped for hundreds of thousands of years. Each layer of ice in the ice core 
also contains deuterium, a hydrogen isotope that enables scientists to deter-
mine what the temperature was when that ice layer was formed.
 
An atmospheric temperature change of just 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree 
Celsius) leads to a change of nine parts per million (ppm) in the amount of 
deuterium stored in the ice. By contrasting the ancient temperatures revealed 
through the analysis of the layer’s deuterium and carbon dioxide, scientists 
can glimpse the relationship between historical levels of carbon dioxide and 
temperature. The two run side by side almost like the lanes of a race track.

Scientists still don’t know the exact cause and effect relationship between 
greenhouse gases and temperature throughout the planet’s history. The cause 
of the last ice age, for instance, probably wasn’t a drop in atmospheric carbon 
dioxide, but a result of the Earth tilting away from the sun in a phase in the 
planet’s Milankovitch cycle (which we discuss in the section “Considering 
Causes of Global Warming Other Than Greenhouse Gases,” earlier in this 
chapter). This cooling then spurred the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide to drop, 
and the two events in tandem brought about the ice age. Ultimately, scien-
tists still aren’t sure whether temperature affects carbon dioxide, or whether 
carbon dioxide affects temperature — it’s a question of which came first, the 
chicken or the egg.

What scientists do know for certain is that a distinct pattern and relation-
ship between carbon dioxide and temperature exists; when one is high, so is 
the other, and when one is low, the other plunges, too. Scientists also know 
that the Milankovitch cycle has little to do with climate change over the past 
200 or 300 years. In that time, human-produced carbon dioxide levels have 
skyrocketed, and temperature is starting to follow. As a result, scientists are 
certain that human-produced greenhouse gases are currently warming the 
Earth. This close relationship between greenhouse gas concentrations and 
temperature suggests these higher levels of carbon dioxide will cause tem-
peratures to continue rising.
Figure 3-3 shows the historic connection between carbon dioxide concen-
trations and fluctuations in temperature, as captured in ice-core deuterium 
levels.

The Consequences of Continued 
Carbon Dioxide Increases
If scientists are right about the connection between carbon dioxide and cli-
mate change, then what comes next? The past is all very interesting, but it’s 
history. What the future holds concerns all of humanity — and the predic-
tions that scientists have for the future are alarming.
As the ice cores demonstrate, carbon dioxide levels have always fluctuated 
(check out “Making the Case for Carbon” earlier in the chapter for more infor-
mation), but the atmosphere now has 35 percent more carbon dioxide than 
at any time in the last 800,000 years. Historically, carbon dioxide has reached 
highs of 280 parts per million (ppm) at a maximum. The atmosphere is now 
at 385 ppm.

50
Part I: Understanding Global Warming 
This increase in carbon dioxide is an extraordinary shift. If present trends 
continue, the Earth’s average temperature is likely to increase by 3.6 to 10.8 
degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 6 degrees Celsius) above 1850 temperatures — and 
that temperature increase could be disastrous for all life on Earth. The Earth’s 
temperature has already risen approximately 1.4 degrees F (0.8 degrees C).
The tipping point
The tipping point is the point at which something has gone too far — or past 
the point of no return. Think of slowly going up the first climb on a roller 
coaster. After you go over the top, no one can stop the ride.
Scientists believe that climate change has a tipping point, when the damage 
becomes too great to be reversed. After this point, not only can nothing 
reverse the impact on the planet, but little could stop that impact from 
increasing, either — it just keeps getting worse.
To determine the climate’s tipping point, scientists first had to look at what 
would happen if, say, temperatures went up by, say, 3.6 or even 10.8 degrees 
Fahrenheit (2 or 6 degrees Celsius) above 1850 levels. (These temperature 
increases refer to the global average, which we discuss in the following sec-
tion.) To figure out the effects of temperature increases, scientists depend on 
sophisticated models. Not models that you build when you’re a kid by using 
papier mâché — these kinds of models are mathematical, designed to be run 
on a computer, and simulate the functioning of the Earth’s atmosphere and 
climate. (See the “How climate models work” sidebar, in this chapter, for more 
information.) Researchers input data about the climate and how it works, and 
then start modifying that data to create various alternative scenarios.
Why scientists compare temperatures 
to the year 1850
The international scientific community uses 
the temperatures at the time just before the 
Industrial Revolution (1850) as a baseline. They 
do so because human contributions to climate 
change were not significant before that time. 
By measuring the build-up of greenhouse gases 
and temperatures compared to what they were 
before the Industrial Revolution, they’re mea-
suring the impact that is largely attributable to 
human activity.

51
 Chapter 3: The Big Deal about Carbon
Scientists figured out, for example, how hot the climate would need to 
become to melt the entire world’s ice sheets — this melt would cause sea 
levels to rise, which would flood coastal cities around the world. At the same 
time, the scientists figured out the amount of greenhouse gases needed to 
reach these temperatures.
By looking at these different possibilities, scientists could tell which effects of 
climate change humans can deal with and which ones are beyond humanity’s 
ability to adapt to or control.
 
The IPCC defined an average global temperature rise of about 3.6 degrees 
Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above 1850 levels as the official climate 
change warning zone, but that temperature increase is below the point of no 
return, or the tipping point. If the temperature goes to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit 
(3 degrees Celsius), 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) becomes inevi-
table. At 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius), 9 degrees Fahrenheit 
(5 degrees Celsius) becomes inevitable. And so on. The increases soon outstrip 
any human ability to slow or control those increases. The increased warming 
becomes inevitable because of positive feedback loops (see Chapter 7 for the 
lowdown on feedback loops). Melting permafrost releases methane, speeding 
How climate models work
The climate is affected by both the atmosphere 
(the part that everyone talks about the most) 
and the oceans. Changes in the air happen 
quickly, and changes in the oceans happen 
very slowly. So, scientists have been able to 
study air changes relatively easily, but they 
have quite literally had to wait and see what 
happens to the oceans. And because the 
ocean actually affects the bulk of the climate, 
they’re also having to wait and see what hap-
pens to the entire climate. So, scientists need 
climate models, projected scenarios created by 
super computers, to help predict major climate 
changes.
The most complex climate models, such as 
those used at NASA, look at the Earth in three 
dimensions. The computer divides the atmo-
sphere and oceans into square columns. Each of 
these columns has its own set of weather infor-
mation based on the history and current status 
of the area. This information gives the computer 
a base to work from. Then, the researcher run-
ning the model changes the numbers to see 
what would happen if one condition changed, 
such as air temperature. For short-term pro-
jections (looking forward a day to a month), an 
advanced computer can make the calculation in 
20 minutes. But making longer-term projections 
(such as 50 years from now) can take a month 
or two. A global circulation climate model can 
take as long as a year to produce results after 
researchers input all the variables.

Part I: Understanding Global Warming 
more warming. Melting icecaps reveal more dark water, speeding warmer 
ocean temperatures and more ice melt. Dryer conditions lead to more forest 
fires, releasing more carbon and causing more warming. This domino effect 
could lead to an unlivable world.
No one knows exactly where that tipping point for global warming is. 
Scientists know only that humanity has a chance to avoid it by holding 
carbon dioxide concentrations to no more than 450 ppm, to keep the planet’s 
average temperature increase at or below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees 
Celsius). The IPCC says that the average global temperature will rise by 3.6 
degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) when total carbon dioxide levels 
reach 425 to 450 ppm. Trouble is, it’s moving upwards at 2 ppm per year and 
is currently at about 385 ppm of carbon dioxide as we type this.
Uncertainty always exists when it comes to making predictions. Acknowledging 
this, the IPCC actually hedged its bets slightly and said that the warning zone 
is between 2.7 and 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 and 2.5 degrees Celsius) above 
1850 levels — or 1.3 and 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit (0.7 and 1.7 degrees Celsius) 
above current levels. Its assessment report suggested that people consider the 
critical warning zone to be 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above 
1850 levels — or 1.3 degrees F (0.7 degrees C) above current levels — on the 
basis that it’s better to be safe than sorry. (The United Nations calls this phi-
losophy the precautionary principle.)
In fact, humans have already committed the planet to a 2.9-degree Fahrenheit 
(1.6-degree Celsius) temperature rise versus 1850 levels — or 1.4 degrees 
Fahrenheit (0.8 degree Celsius) beyond today’s temperature — by the end of 
the century, based on current climate models. Humanity could level off this 
increase if it implements the necessary solutions by 2010.
A few degrees is a lot
Three or four degrees Fahrenheit seems like a small number to make a big 
deal about. You might even be thinking that an extra 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit 
(2 degrees Celsius) seems like a perfect amount of global warming. Your 
garden would grow better, you’d be hitting the beach more often, and the 
golf season might be longer, right? But 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees 
Celsius) is actually a lot. The IPCC reports that the global average tempera-
ture in the middle of the last ice age was only 7.2 to 12.6 degrees Fahrenheit 
(4 to 7 degrees Celsius) colder than it is today.
 
This increase of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit refers to the average global tempera-
ture, but average numbers hide the extremes on either end. For example, you 
can dive into a pool that has an average depth of 1 foot (30 centimeters) if it’s 
10 feet (3 meters) at the deep end. Right now, the average global temperature 

53
 Chapter 3: The Big Deal about Carbon
is 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 degrees Celsius). Of course, temperatures can 
be much colder than that in the winter and way warmer in the summer. In that 
same 60-degree Fahrenheit (15.6-degree Celsius) global average, you can go 
skiing in the Alps or swimming in the Caribbean.
The rate of warming in Arctic regions is twice the global average, whereas 
regions close to the equator could see very little change. Because of the 
Arctic’s high warming rate, less sea ice is left at the end of each summer — in 
fact, the area covered by perennial sea ice has gone from covering 50 to 60 
percent of the Arctic region down to covering 30 percent, according to data 
processed by NASA.
What happens when the mercury rises
A climb of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) in the world’s average 
temperature may trigger a number of unpleasant consequences:
 
 Increased droughts in what are now semi-arid areas
 
 Rapid Arctic ice melt
 
 Fast loss of permafrost, the frozen ground in the Arctic
 
 Increased damage to cities and major infrastructures because of higher-
intensity storms and floods
 
 A possible 30-percent increase in species extinctions
For more on the consequences of global warming, check out Part III.
Figure 3-4 outlines the changes that different temperature increases, up to 
and beyond 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius), may bring.
Cutting Back on Carbon
Modern civilization probably won’t stop producing greenhouse gas emissions 
altogether. But to stop levels from passing much farther beyond 450 ppm — 
and thus limit the world to a 3.6-degrees Fahrenheit (2-degrees Celsius) tem-
perature rise — more people need to reduce their emissions. Because of this 
global need, the first step of the Kyoto Protocol is very important — it requires 
just over a 5-percent reduction (below 1990 levels of emissions) by 2012. (See 
Chapter 11 for more about international climate change agreements.)

 Chapter 3: The Big Deal about Carbon
 
Some people say that the world will have a hard time reducing emissions by 
even 5 percent because of the energy-intensive ways that people currently live 
in industrialized countries. Others argue that this emissions reduction may 
be humanity’s best choice because it’s the safest route to take. (We consider 
ways that governments can help lower emissions in Part IV, and in Part V, we 
look at how businesses and individuals can cut back on emissions.)
Countries haven’t yet agreed to any greenhouse gas reduction targets past 
the year 2012, but they did set in motion new negotiations in November 2007 
aimed at deciding these future greenhouse gas reduction targets. The IPCC 
recommends reducing carbon emissions by 50 to 80 percent below 1990 
levels by 2050. Many countries and groups have committed to an aggressive 
2050 goal independently, including the European Union, California, and the 
World Mayors Council. (See Chapter 10 for solutions being implemented 
by governments around the world.) A few countries, such as Canada, won’t 
commit to the IPCC’s recommendation until they know for sure that they can 
hit the target.
 
The main reason a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is so impor-
tant is because a chance exists that the planet’s climate situation could get 
worse than predicted. For example, changes could speed up the warming 
cycle because of positive feedback loops (see Chapter 7 to find out about 
these feedback loops). Or parts of the carbon cycle could weaken because of 
increasing temperatures, meaning that not as much carbon would be sucked 
up by carbon sinks such as forests and oceans — leaving humans to deal with 
more emissions than expected. (The precautionary principle, which we talk 
about in the section “The tipping point,” earlier in this chapter, looks more 
appealing by the day!)
If civilization keeps doing what it’s doing, even with no increase in how much 
greenhouse gases it produces from year to year, it’ll lock Earth into the 
3.6-degrees Fahrenheit (2-degrees Celsius) deal by the end of 2010, though 
humanity wouldn’t see the temperature shift until years later. Every time a 
person drives a car, for example, he or she releases carbon dioxide that will 
act as a force for global warming for the next 100 years!
The global climate system has long lag times. The atmosphere doesn’t turn 
on a dime. The damage humanity does today will have an effect over a cen-
tury. If people keep on with business as usual, the world might be committing 
to the 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2-degrees Celsius) rise sooner than expected.

hat’s causing climate change? Many factors are 
playing a role, but one substantial source of green-
house gases stands out: fossil fuels. We dig deep, exploring 
where these fuels come from and why they’re causing so 
much trouble. We also look at how major industries, from 
manufacturing to logging to farming, are contributing to 
climate change, and we investigate how everyone is unwit-
tingly contributing to the problem.

W
herever you live, however you heat your home, and however you get 
around, you probably meet most of your energy needs by burning 
fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.
Burning these fossil fuels releases large amounts of greenhouse gases (we 
talk about those gases in Chapter 2). In fact, just over two-thirds of human-
produced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere come directly from burning 
fossil fuels. In this chapter, we examine the types of fossil fuels, look at how 
people use them in their day-to-day lives, and assess fossil fuels’ overall con-
tribution to climate change.
From Fossils to Fuel
A lot of people know that fossil fuels pollute and produce carbon, but they 
don’t understand why. To understand that, you need to know where fossil 
fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, come from. They’re literally derived 
from fossils of past living matter.
Talk about fossils, and the first things that may come to mind are dinosaurs. 
But when it comes to the fossils in fossil fuels, they’re actually fossils from 
before the time of the dinosaurs — starting off as decomposing plant material 
(not decomposing dinosaurs).

60
Par t II: Tracking Down the Causes 
Many of these plants grew in swamps that used to cover even the northern-
most parts of the globe 300 to 400 million years ago. Usually, plants and trees 
rot away into the soil, but swamps don’t have enough air (it’s what scien-
tists call an anaerobic environment) for the usual decomposition process to 
happen. Instead, over time, these dead plants and trees sank to the bottom of 
the swamps where they eventually turned into peat. The peat was buried and 
compressed under layers of sediments such as sand and silt. As these sedi-
ments turned into rock, more pressure was piled on the peat below it. The 
moisture was squeezed out of the peat like water squeezed out of a sponge, 
turning the peat to fossil fuels. So, millions of years later, fossil fuels are typi-
cally found deep underground.
Similar fossil fuels are also found under the ocean, where sea plants and old 
shells were buried and pressed down under the ocean sediment. See Figure 
4-1 to get an idea of what this process looked like.
Not all plant matter in those ancient swamps and in the oceans turned into 
fossil fuels. The process needed the right conditions, such as enough pres-
sure and the correct bacteria. Although many of these plants were very 
different from anything known about today, they sucked up carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere and gave off oxygen, like all plants still do (check out 
Chapter 2 for more about photosynthesis).
 
When fossil fuels are burned for energy, those fuels release the carbon, in the 
form of carbon dioxide and other gases that these ancient plants stored. (For 
more on why releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is problematic, 
refer to Chapter 2.)
Greenhouse gases are released not only when these fuels are burned, but 
also when they’re retrieved from the earth. Extracting the fuels and process-
ing them into their final forms requires fossil fuels, and thus produces carbon 
dioxide. The oil has to be taken out of the earth, transported to a refinery, 
processed into a usable form, and transported to its final destination. 
Because traditional sources of oil have begun to dry up, industry has turned 
to sources such as Alberta, Canada’s tar sands, which require even more 
energy to yield any fuel. (See the sidebar “How much oil is left” for more 
about the possible end of oil and the sidebar “Athabasca tar sands: A sticky 
situation” for information about the tar sands.)
 
Fossil fuels give a one-time-only burst of energy. Take them out of the ground 
and burn them, and that’s it. The supply of fossil fuels is limited, and after 
people use them up, civilization will have to wait millions of years before 
any more exist. That’s why, no matter what, civilization will have to rely on a 
diversity of fuel sources to produce energy in the future. We talk about alter-
native energy sources in Chapter 13.

Par t II: Tracking Down the Causes 
Examining the Different Types 
of Fossil Fuels
Coal, oil, and natural gas are all fossil fuels, but they’re not all the same. They 
differ in how they’re used, how much they’re used, the greenhouse gases that 
they release when they’re burned, and even where they come from.
When land plants, such as trees, decomposed hundreds of millions of years 
ago, they pressed together into a solid form known as coal. Plants and ani-
mals in the oceans decomposed in a similar way — sinking to the bottom 
of the ocean, getting buried under sediments, forming peat, and eventually 
being compressed into fossil fuels such as oil.
Each type of fossil fuel has a different amount of carbon in it, so it puts a dif-
ferent amount of carbon dioxide into the air when it’s burned. Coal releases 
the most carbon dioxide when burned, natural gas the least. In the following 
sections, we take a closer look at the different types of fossil fuels, starting 
with the worst offender, coal, and working our way down to natural gas.
Coal
You may think that coal was king forever ago, but about a quarter of the 
world’s energy still comes from this fossil fuel. Coal was the first fossil fuel 
that humans burned for energy — in fact, the use of coal predates written 
history.
Coal is a very dirty fuel. Because it’s essentially carbon, it releases carbon 
dioxide when burned, along with many other dangerous pollutants. In 
December 1952, to cite one dreadful example, a massive lull in air circulation 
trapped the coal smoke from tens of thousands of London homes over the 
English city, creating a blanket of pollution. In four days, the deadly smog 
(the name comes from combining smoke and fog) killed upwards of 4,000 
people directly, with 8,000 more succumbing to respiratory illnesses later on.
 
Some of the noxious stuff inside coal includes sulfur dioxide, mercury, and a 
huge array of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (cancer-causing and hormone-
disrupting toxic chemicals, also in oil and gas). And it doesn’t stop there. Coal 
also releases arsenic and cyanide; carcinogens (things that promote cancer), 
such as benzene, naphthalene, and toluene; and a witch’s brew of other nasties.
 
Clean coal doesn’t exist. Options for cleaner uses of coal, however, do.

63
 Chapter 4: Living in the Dark Ages of Fossil Fuels
The first step taken to reduce pollution from coal plants was aimed at reduc-
ing nitrous oxide emissions. To do this, the coal is burned at incredibly high 
temperatures (around 1500 degrees F) — this is considered a “low tempera-
ture” compared to the 2500 degrees F at which coal is usually burned. At such 
a low temperature, nitrogen does not combine with oxygen, thus no nitrogen 
oxide (NOx) is created. This process happens during the burning process and 
reduces many pollutants but does nothing to reduce carbon dioxide.
The next step in pollution reduction was when coal-fired power plants in 
many industrialized countries added scrubbers in the 1970s to capture the 
sulfur and prevent it from falling to Earth as acid rain. Scrubbers are tech-
nically called flue gas desulfurization units — devices installed right in the 
flue. The device sprays a specially made liquid mix of water and powdered 
limestone right into the emissions coming from the burning coal. The spray 
immediately soaks up and becomes one with the sulfur, trapping it in this 
new solid material.
Another way of “cleaning” coal is called fluidized bed combustion, where the 
coal actually becomes liquid in the bed of the furnace. Scrubbers and fluid-
ized bed combustion reduce emissions of nitrogen and sulfur dioxide, but not 
of carbon dioxide. Industries were even able to extract the sulfur and sell it, 
increasing their profits. Removing sulfur dioxide was a step in the right direc-
tion for solving the problem of acid rain, but these scrubbers, again, do noth-
ing to reduce carbon dioxide, mercury, or the whole array of other pollutants.
Research and development teams are devoting a lot of time and energy to 
producing a type of coal that doesn’t add to greenhouse gases. One idea 
suggests turning coal into a gas and stripping the carbon dioxide out of that 
gas, then storing the carbon dioxide in the ground. The technology to actu-
ally strip the carbon dioxide from the gas doesn’t yet exist, but the carbon-
storage technology does (and parts of Europe already use it). Until the day 
that carbon dioxide can be stripped out of coal, conservation practices and 
replacing coal-fired power plants with cleaner, renewable fuels are the most 
effective and sustainable ways to reduce greenhouse gases. (Flip to Chapter 
13 for more on clean fuels and carbon storage.)
Oil
Today, oil provides about 40 percent of the world’s energy. People use it 
each time they fill up their cars, get on a plane, or turn on an oil furnace. Oil 
is also the key raw material used for manufacturing a wide variety of very 
common products, including plastics (from food containers to toys), artificial 
fibers, and a host of other goods such as hair gels, shampoo, deodorant, and 
dishwashing liquid.

64
Par t II: Tracking Down the Causes 
 
All petroleum products start out as crude oil. A barrel of crude is more than 
just a barrel of crude! You can have sweet crude and regular (or sour) crude. 
(Sweet crude has lower sulfur content.) Then, the light and heavy crude classi-
fications depend on, quite literally, how light and heavy the crude is. Whatever 
the type, crude oil is the straight-up oil, before anyone does anything to it. 
Refineries process the crude oil to make gasoline for cars, diesel fuel for trains 
and trucks, heating oil for homes, and jet fuel used in airplanes.
How much oil is left?
Climate change activists have been urging 
people to reduce their fossil fuel consumption 
because of the impact on global warming, but 
another compelling reason to cut back on oil 
use exists: It’s running out. There are roughly 
1.4 trillion barrels of proved oil reserves left, 
according to British Petroleum reports. Proved 
oil reserves are estimated volumes of oil with 
an 80 to 90 percent certainty, according to the 
International Energy Agency. The argument 
about when, exactly, the world will run out of 
fossil fuels (particularly oil) has been going on 
for decades. When the Club of Rome released 
its famous Limits to Growth report back in 1970, 
it said with certainty that the planet was run-
ning out of oil. The 1990s once again saw the 
rise of the argument that the planet would soon 
be out of oil. This time, the alarm was raised by 
geologist M. King Hubbert’s concept of peak oil. 
Hubbert’s peak referred to the point at which 
people would begin depleting known reserves, 
or when oil consumption is higher than oil pro-
duction. Today’s peakers, as they’re known, 
are finding a lot of evidence that this point has 
passed. They argue not that Earth is running out 
of oil (which it will eventually, without question), 
but that Earth has already run out of cheap oil.
Cheap oil has been the lifeblood of the post–
World War II economic boom. The July 18, 2007, 
report that the U.S. National Petroleum Council 
(NPC) sent to the U.S. Secretary of Energy 
states that 80 percent of today’s oil production 
must be replaced with new sources of oil or 
other energy sources within the next 25 years. 
That’s a daunting prospect. It may or may not be 
possible — but even attempting it will surely be 
very expensive.
The International Energy Agency estimates that 
the world economy needs to find an additional 
3.2 million barrels of oil a day. Every single day, 
the world’s petroleum geologists, and oil and 
gas companies, must find new sources of oil — 
new oil fields and new bitumen deposits equal 
to 3.2 million barrels of oil — just to keep the 
current supply steady.
Peakers argue that when the crunch hits, it will 
really hurt, causing recessions. People won’t be 
able to afford the gas to fuel their cars, and sub-
urbs will suffer. But people can see it coming 
and can start investing in energy efficiency and 
smarter ways of using the oil that’s available. 
And using more renewable fuels could help 
cushion the blow of more expensive, dwindling 
fossil fuels. Climate change activists know that 
the atmosphere is running out of space for the 
wastes from burning fossil fuels, no matter how 
much longer supplies last.
Virtually everyone agrees: The age of cheap oil 
is over.

65
 Chapter 4: Living in the Dark Ages of Fossil Fuels
When you think of oil, you probably imagine it shooting up out of the ground 
like a fountain. But those Beverly Hillbillies days of “black gold, Texas tea” are 
long over. Humanity has already used up most of those easy-to-tap reserves.
 
Oil is starting to play hard-to-get. Although many disagree about whether 
humanity has hit peak oil — the point of maximum production of oil, after 
which the supply begins to be depleted (see the sidebar “How much oil is 
left?” in this chapter, for details). Companies are now discovering about only 
30 billion new barrels a year, in comparison to the 200 billion barrels a year 
that they found in the early 1960s.
Oil is found in harder-to-reach places these days, and sometimes, companies 
need large amounts of water to push the oil out. Look at the Athabasca tar 
sands in Alberta, Canada, for example. The oil industry used to consider 
separating the oil from this thick, gooey mixture of clay, sand, water, and oil 
too expensive. But now that the price of oil is so high, the industry decided 
that the process of physically pressing the oil out of the sand is worth the 
cost. (Check out the sidebar “Athabasca tar sands: A sticky situation,” in this 
chapter, for an in-depth look at this process.)
Offshore reserves have long been a source of oil — they’re still under the 
ground, but also under the water. You can find these reserves off the east coast 
of Canada, in the Gulf of Mexico, and off the coast of Norway. Now, however, 
the search for new offshore oil fields is heading for more remote and fragile 
areas, such as the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. These two diverse ocean ecosys-
tems host thriving wildlife, on which the local indigenous peoples depend.
On the ground, both government and oil companies are proposing oil drilling 
in protected areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Companies 
are also proposing projects in the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador, another 
fragile ecosystem that’s also a vital part of the planet’s carbon cycle (refer to 
Chapter 2 for more information).
No one would have considered these sources of oil a decade or so ago. But 
dwindling oil supplies and rising prices have changed all that. The world 
economy has become used to oil higher than $120 a barrel. And to think that 
the world was shocked when oil hit $30 a barrel in the 1970s!
Natural gas
Natural gas is mostly methane, which makes it a little different than the other 
fossil fuels (check out Chapter 2 for more about methane). The cleanest of 
all fossil fuels, natural gas gives off only carbon dioxide and water when it 
burns. Rotting trees and plant matter release methane if the conditions are 
wet and airless. Natural gas can usually be found around coal beds or oil 

66
Par t II: Tracking Down the Causes 
fields. Although this underground natural gas will run out someday, humanity 
can produce pure methane in other ways, such as capturing the methane gas 
that comes from the rotting waste in landfills.
Athabasca tar sands: A sticky situation
No matter what the name suggests, the tar 
sands (also called oil sands) aren’t a tarry 
version of the Sahara Desert. They’re boreal 
forests (coniferous forests, found between 
50 and 60 degrees North, across northern 
Canada, Russia, Alaska, and Asia, as well as 
Scandinavian Europe) and muskeg (a type of 
wetland found in boreal and arctic areas) that 
cover a sandy soil that’s 10-percent bitumen, a 
viscous material that resembles tarry molasses. 
To get the oil, you have to squeeze this bitumen 
out of the sands.
The Athabasca tar sands hold 173 billion barrels 
of proven retrievable oil, and up to 315 billion 
barrels of potentially retrievable oil if new tech-
nologies are developed. These reserves make it 
the second-largest oil patch in the world, after 
Saudi Arabia. Reaching the bitumen involves 
stripping away the muskeg and boreal forest — 
a single mine may need more than 6,500 hec-
tares (16,000 acres) of forest cleared.
After removing the muskeg and forest, oil com-
panies dig the bitumen out of open-pit mines 
that are 245 feet (75 meters) deep. To extract 
the bitumen that lies even deeper, they have to 
pump huge amounts of water and steam into 
the ground to loosen it up and bring it to the 
surface. They use between 2.5 and 4 barrels of 
water for every barrel of oil extracted, depend-
ing on how deep the bitumen lies. This process 
creates a lot of wastewater, full of toxic waste, 
that they store behind enormous dikes.
The Alberta government permits the tar sands 
operation to use more than 1,177 cubic feet 
(359 million cubic meters) of water annually — 
twice as much as the city of Calgary, which has 
a population of over a million people, uses in 
the same period. A 2006 report by the Canadian 
National Energy Board questioned whether the 
project’s massive water use was sustainable. 
Many towns and communities, such as Fort 
McMurray, also rely on the river from which this 
water is drawn for their drinking water — the 
water that the mining uses may one day seri-
ously stress the water source of Fort McMurray 
residents.
Heating up the bitumen and extracting it from 
the tar sands takes a lot of energy — energy 
that’s supplied by . . . burning fossil fuels. These 
operations use the equivalent of a third to a half 
a barrel of oil for every barrel of oil produced. 
(Anyone see a losing cycle here?)
So, the mining industry consumes a huge 
amount of energy in order to produce oil, which 
primarily the United States buys for cars that 
don’t have proper energy efficiency standards 
(California excluded!).
Canada’s decision to keep expanding and 
developing the tar sands is an example for other 
nations of what not to do — while making oil 
development a top priority it’s impossible for 
Canada to decrease its greenhouse gas emis-
sions. The report compared it to the American 
decision to encourage coal as a form of energy 
independence and to Brazil’s clearing of rain-
forests.

 Chapter 4: Living in the Dark Ages of Fossil Fuels
Natural gas is almost pure methane by the time it reaches your doorstep. A 
quarter of the world’s energy comes from natural gas. The Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports show that the Earth contains more 
natural gas than regular oil, but that natural gas is patchy and spread out in 
comparison to oil, making it harder to tap into.

Because of how relatively clean it is, some energy analysts have promoted 
natural gas as a clean-energy fuel to replace coal in power plants. But this 
solution may not be all it’s cracked up to be. Natural gas is
 
 A finite resource: Supplies of natural gas are tight. High-end estimates 
predict that world supplies will run out in 50 years at the current rate of 
use, and in as few as 5 years in North America.
 
 Difficult to transport: Moving natural gas involves liquefying it first, 
which requires a lot of energy. This liquefying process also creates 
carbon dioxide emissions, depending on the source of energy. (For 
instance, coal-fueled energy would create more emissions than hydro-
electric energy.)
 
 Potentially dangerous: Concerns exist around possible pipeline explo-
sions, as well as the environmental damage created by gas exploration. 
Leaks and explosions do happen: On December 14, 2005, the community 
in Bergenfield, New Jersey, awoke to a tremendous explosion caused 
by a leaking natural gas pipeline that demolished an apartment building 
and claimed three lives.
Fuelling Civilization’s Growth: 
Adding to the Greenhouse Effect
Fossil fuels have been powering human development for a long time. Since 
the Industrial Revolution, civilization has been steadily consuming more 
fossil fuels; consequently, more and more carbon dioxide has been pumped 
into the atmosphere.
The world’s growing population has been a key factor in the increasing levels 
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Earth’s population was 1.2 billion in 
1850, when the Industrial Revolution was taking place. In the past 50 years 
alone, the population has doubled from 3 billion to more than 6 billion — 
today, the population is 6.5 billion. Even if the per capita use of fossil fuels 
had remained relatively stable, the amount of greenhouse gases would have 
increased. And, of course, use keeps on growing.

68
Par t II: Tracking Down the Causes 
 
Luckily, population growth is slowing and should level off. (The bad news is 
that this isn’t expected to happen until the Earth’s population reaches 9 bil-
lion people). Nevertheless, the estimate of population numbers leveling at 
9 billion is a better outcome than some growth curves that put us at exponen-
tial growth to over 12 billion. It all depends on reducing fertility rates, which 
all depends on improving the economic, educational, and political status of 
women and girls.
 
Countries don’t produce carbon dioxide emissions equally. Unfortunately, 
North Americans are over-achievers when it comes to creating carbon dioxide 
emissions. According to the World Resources Institute, one North American 
emits the same amount as two and a half Europeans, 10 Bangladeshis, or more 
than 20 sub-Saharan Africans!
Population pressure is a factor, but a growing economy also plays a large role in 
boosting emissions of fossil fuels. The modern world economy has been hard-
wired to use them. Businesses and governments used to think that economic 
growth depended on using more and more fossil fuels. But then, in the 1970s, 
when major members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC) drastically reduced oil exports for political reasons, oil prices jumped. 
As a result, governments encouraged people to use less oil — so they drove 
less, bought fuel-efficient cars, and practiced energy conservation. Industrialized 
nations took the first, tentative steps in reducing the use of fossil fuels.
But, after the mid-1980s (when oil prices dived), some old addictions took 
over. In the U.S., for instance, the size of the average home (which needs 
fossil fuels to heat it) has increased by 50 percent since 1970 (though the size 
of the average family has decreased), and more drivers are using large, fuel-
guzzling vehicles, such as SUVs. (You can read about improving home energy 
use in Chapter 18, and about more fuel-efficient vehicles in Chapter 17.) 
Countries such as Iceland and Sweden, however, switched to a renewable 
energy base and stayed that way.
 
Historically, the stronger a country’s economy, the more greenhouse gases 
it produces. A strengthening economy means a greater consumption of fossil 
fuels — just look at the rapid growth of the auto industry in China, which 
promises to surpass the U.S. in production and sales.
But even as the economies of developing countries grow, they still emit only 
a small portion of what people in industrialized countries do, per capita. 
They have a lot of catching up to do. When we wrote the first draft of this 
chapter in 2007, the world’s biggest greenhouse gas polluter as a whole coun-
try was the United States. But, since then, China’s emissions of greenhouse 
gases have already surpassed the U.S.’s. The total pollution from developing 
countries is expected to exceed the pollution from the industrialized world 
by 2030. (We take a look at developing nations in Chapter 12.)

69
 Chapter 4: Living in the Dark Ages of Fossil Fuels
A low-carbon future is possible. In fact, the IPCC says countries need to move 
quickly to clean energy or else the course of climate change will become irre-
versible. It recommends that governments establish effective policies that sup-
port clean energies and wean the world off oil. We talk more about government 
solutions in Chapter 10, and explore energy alternatives in Chapter 13.
 
Some countries show that economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions 
aren’t necessarily intertwined. Sweden has seen 44-percent economic growth 
while reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 8 percent below 1990 levels. 
Sweden has pledged to become the first country on Earth to go off oil by the 
year 2020.

o one likes the blame game; pointing fingers and making accusations 
doesn’t solve anything. When it comes to global warming, no one 
person, industry, or country is responsible for the build-up of greenhouse 
gases. Nobody wakes up in the morning and decides to try to make global 
warming worse. But every activity adds up.
This chapter zeros in on where the bulk of emissions comes from: the big 
greenhouse gas emitters, including power producers, buildings’ energy sys-
tems, industry, shipping goods, agriculture practices, and deforestation. We 
get into further detail in Chapter 6, looking at how individual decisions play 
into the bigger picture.
Power to the People: Energy Use
In an automated age, just about everything in our civilization requires 
power — from the furnaces in our buildings to the batteries in our MP3 
players to the engines in the trucks on the highway. Unfortunately, that 
power isn’t always Earth-friendly; most of it comes from fossil fuels (which 
we talk about in Chapter 4). Energy use accounts for about two-thirds of 
human-caused greenhouse gas emissions in the world.
About half of all the world’s energy-linked emissions come from the Group 
of Eight (G8) countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States. The world’s remaining 186 countries 

72
Part II: Tracking Down the Causes 
account for the rest. Sounds unbalanced, but it looks like developing coun-
tries are moving quickly to tip the scales. Rates of energy use are growing 
fastest in developing countries.
Producing electricity
Generating electricity produces large amounts of greenhouse gases. Large-
scale power plants are incredibly inefficient, and they essentially waste as 
much as two-thirds of the fuel that they use, either as heat sent up smoke 
stacks or through electricity lost along transmission lines.
 
Power plants take one kind of energy and turn it into another, electricity. 
Frequently, that initial energy source is a fossil fuel. Coal or oil plants, for 
example, burn the coal or oil to produce enough heat to boil water to gener-
ate steam. The force of the steam turns turbines, which creates mechanical 
energy. This process generates electricity that’s delivered to buildings. Check 
out Figure 5-1 to see how a coal-powered electricity plant works.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that 80 percent of Australia’s 
electricity comes from coal. The U.S. uses coal for 50 percent of its electric-
ity. Canada, on the other hand, is taking advantage of its surroundings and 
generates 58 percent of its electricity from hydropower, meaning far fewer 
emissions are generated to create electricity.
 
Incredibly, many countries around the world are building more coal plants, 
despite the rise in awareness about climate change. The IEA says that coal 
demand is growing 2.2 percent each year and probably won’t let up for at least 
the next 20 years. New coal plants keep popping up, even in the European 

73
 Chapter 5: Getting Right to the Source: The Big Emitters
Union (EU) and North America. Why? Coal is cheap. Even with potential 
carbon taxes (which we discuss in Chapter 10), coal is still the cheapest 
source of energy in the world because the infrastructure is already in place, 
and the price of coal is low. The downside is that each new plant represents 
a 30-year commitment to infrastructure supporting burning fossil fuels and to 
continuing greenhouse gas emissions. (Refer to Chapter 4 for more about coal 
and the myth of clean coal.)
Our dirty old coal plants are just that — very dirty and very old. They rely 
on a technology that we should have left behind in the 19th century. We 
have more efficient forms of energy that don’t need fossil fuels at all and go 
through far fewer steps — such as hydropower, which uses the run of the 
river to turn the turbines. In Chapter 13, we look at all the other ways that 
people can produce electricity without boiling water. (You can still make a 
cup of tea by using electricity flowing from a non-polluting wind turbine or 
solar photovoltaic unit, though.)
Using up energy in buildings
About 15 percent of civilization’s emissions come from the energy expended 
to heat and produce electricity for buildings, according to the International 
Energy Agency (IEA). Two-thirds of that energy is used in homes (see 
Chapter 6); commercial and institutional buildings, such as schools, colleges 
and universities, hospitals, shopping malls, and office buildings, use the 
other third.
 
The power plants in a region or oil-run heating systems right in a building 
make heating and electricity possible. These plants and systems burn fossil 
fuels and create the greenhouse gas emissions.
Think of all the ways that people use — and waste — energy and electricity 
in buildings. How many times have you walked into an office building in the 
middle of summer and felt like you were being transported back to the Ice 
Age because of the extreme air conditioning? People wear suit jackets and 
sweaters indoors in the summer, and shirt sleeves and skirts in the winter, 
reversing the seasonal shifts!
Many other factors influence the greenhouse gas-producing intensity of build-
ings, such as whether they
 
 Are well-insulated (see Figure 5-2 to see where an inadequately insulated 
building’s heating and cooling escapes, wasting energy and creating 
more emissions)
 
 Have proper caulking around doors and windows
 
 Make maximum use of daylight to avoid relying on electric lighting

In Chapter 18, we talk about how you can reduce the amount of energy

Powering industry
When people look for a single place to lay the blame for global warming, they 
often talk about “industry.” After all, it’s a pretty broad target, including just 
about any business that manufactures. And, admittedly, industry is responsi-
ble for a big chunk of human-produced greenhouse gases. Just below 40 per-
cent of global carbon dioxide emissions come from energy used by industry. 
Industry almost exclusively releases the rest of the human-produced green-
house gases — including methane, sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons 
(PFCs), some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and some nitrous dioxide. (We talk 
about greenhouse gases in detail in Chapter 2.)
Industry produces greenhouse gas emissions in two main ways:
 
 Burning fossil fuels to create energy and electricity.
 
 Plain emissions that come directly from materials. The ingredients in 
cement production, for example, give off carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, 
and sulfur dioxide.
Over half of the emissions from big industry — from coal-fired power plants, 
other oil and gas activities, construction, manufacturing, electricity produc-
tion, pulp and paper plants, and so on — come from developing countries 

75
 Chapter 5: Getting Right to the Source: The Big Emitters
and countries that have economies in transition. About a third of that energy 
still comes from old coal-burning electricity plants. The smaller industries in 
developing countries often don’t have the financial means or the technology 
to move beyond the older and inefficient equipment. Industrialized countries, 
on the other hand, can advance quickly in developing and using new technol-
ogies that have higher energy efficiency. (We talk about outdated equipment 
and other issues surrounding developing countries in Chapter 12.)
The products of industry that require the most energy are
 
 Metals (primarily iron and steel)
 
 Mineral production (including cement)
 
 Oil
 
 Pulp and paper
Iron and steel
Steel is the metal that we use most in the world. Steel-making is respon-
sible for up to 7 percent of global human-created carbon dioxide emissions. 
Economists have long associated steel production with advanced industrial 
economies. A quarter of all steel today is produced in China.
 
Steel is manufactured in three ways; unfortunately, the most common method 
produces the most carbon dioxide emissions. Most steel is made by melt-
ing down iron ore in coke-fueled furnaces. (No, the furnaces aren’t guzzling 
soda — coke is made by baking coal in airless ovens at extremely high tem-
peratures.) Carbon and other elements are then added to the iron to produce 
steel. This common way to make steel uses the most energy. You might have 
heard of crude steel, which, despite its name, is far more ecologically polite. 
It’s made from the scraps from the regular steel-making process, which are 
melted down again in electric furnaces. This process uses about a third of the 
energy that the regular process does. The last steel-making process doesn’t 
actually make steel at all, but makes a stand-in: direct reduced iron. Natural 
gas is used to melt down the iron, a production process that creates half the 
carbon dioxide emissions of mainstream production. (Industries in industrial-
ized countries are trying to increase the use of this practice to modernize, 
with the benefit of reducing carbon dioxide emissions.)
Most steel-production emissions come from producing coke and burning 
coke and coal in furnaces for energy.
Other metals
Producing other metals also uses a lot of energy, although people make a 
much smaller volume of other metals, compared to steel. Despite the smaller 
amount of metals produced, the industry’s emissions include some of the 

76
Part II: Tracking Down the Causes 
worst greenhouse gases, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs), from manufactur-
ing aluminum, and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), from producing magnesium. Just 
one ton of SF6, for example, has just as powerful a global warming impact as 
16,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.
Aluminum production has one of the highest rates of energy use of all indus-
tries. It requires tremendous amounts of electricity to convert raw materials 
to finished aluminum. Take a look at a can of soda. If the aluminum in the 
can came from virgin materials — in other words, if none of the aluminum in 
that can came from recycled aluminum — the energy required to produce 
that can is equivalent to 8 ounces of gasoline. (Recycling aluminum isn’t just 
about saving space in the landfill; it’s about saving energy!)
 
Some leading aluminum companies, such as Alcan, have been striving to 
reduce emissions. Alcan has reduced its emissions by 30 percent since 1990, 
even though its production has jumped 50 percent. Getting rid of PFCs was 
the key. (Flip to Chapter 14 for the scoop on industries that are implementing 
greenhouse gas-saving solutions.)
Oil
Even though we usually talk about oil as a fuel, we sometimes forget that it’s 
first and foremost a product. The oil industry burns fossil fuels and creates 
emissions when drilling for and extracting fossil fuels! We go into all the fossil 
fuel details, including energy-intensive oil sand developments, in Chapter 4.
Pulp and paper
Mills that create pulp and paper products use a lot of energy. Like for so 
many other industries and our own homes, a power plant often creates that 
energy (we discuss how generating electrical power contributes to green-
house gases in the section “Producing electricity,” earlier in this chapter).
 
Pulp and paper plants have made improvements by using wood waste to gen-
erate power and by capturing waste heat. In Canada, many pulp and paper 
plants generate their own electricity by using hydropower.
Pulp and paper mills also produce emissions in the paper-making processes. 
Mills’ wastewater releases methane, and the mills produce solid waste when 
manufacturing the pulp and paper. And, if you want to trace the pulp and 
paper industry even farther back, the carbon sink of trees is lost when the 
mills harvest those trees for paper products. (Don’t feel guilty. The book 
you’re holding is made from recycled paper and is as environmentally 
friendly as Wiley could make it!)

 Chapter 5: Getting Right to the Source: The Big Emitters
The Road to Ruin: Transportation 
and Greenhouse Gases
Many products today originate in countries that have cheaper labor — you’ll 
likely be hard-pressed to find products made in your own country most of 
the time. The computer that Zoë used to write this book was made in China. 
A banana that you ate for breakfast might be from Ecuador, and your favorite 
t-shirt may have come from Bangladesh.
Cheap goods at a high price to the climate
Today, both raw materials and finished products must travel great distances, 
often thousands of miles, before goods end up in the hands of consumers. 
And because these goods typically travel by ship, truck, or airplane (all big 
emitters of greenhouse gases), most of the products that we buy and food 
that we eat come with a hefty climate change price tag attached.
“Big Box” stores, common throughout North America, offer low-priced mer-
chandise that comes with a high carbon cost. These retail outlets are located 
where land-based tax rates are lower, and space is cheaper than in downtown 
areas. Such areas aren’t well serviced by mass transit, meaning that shoppers 
must drive to the stores, causing greater greenhouse gas emissions. With 
shelves often stocked with goods that have been manufactured in places 
where environmental protections are weak — and then shipped and trucked 
long distances — the deals they offer aren’t nearly as sweet when you factor 
in the climate cost of greenhouse gases.
Keep the air pollution on your side of the border
Trucks idling add serious amounts of air pollu-
tion and greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
The North American Commission for 
Environmental Cooperation (a body established 
alongside the North American Free Trade 
Agreement to review environmental impacts in 
Canada, the U.S., and Mexico) found that mor-
tality among Mexican children in towns along 
the U.S.-Mexico border had gone way up as a 
result of the pollution from diesel trucks idling at 
border crossings.
Air quality has also gone down and respiratory 
illness up in southwestern Ontario because of 
the extra time security checks take at the U.S.-
Canada border since the terrorist attacks on 
September 11, 2001.

78
Part II: Tracking Down the Causes 
Keep on truckin’
Trucks have taken a larger and larger role in shipping goods in the last 
decade or so. And they’re common — as you can tell by all the trucker stops, 
brake-check stations, and runaway lanes that accommodate them on high-
ways. Trucks are everywhere on U.S. highways, so it’s no surprise that the 
International Energy Agency (IEA) has ranked the U.S. as the highest-producing 
country of carbon dioxide emissions from domestic transportation — the U.S. 
creates over a third of the world’s transportation emissions, a total of 1,800 
million metric tons. The second-biggest producer of emissions from transpor-
tation (for now) is China, with a much lower 250 million metric tons.
Business used to move goods by railroad in large amounts and store the 
goods in warehouses. The advent of just-in-time delivery in manufacturing 
has increased the amount of greenhouse gases released per product. Rather 
than have warehouses well-stocked with inventory that kept manufacturers 
and retailers ready for their work and customers, just-in-time delivery moved 
goods to the highways, constantly bringing goods in at the moment they’re 
needed. Fewer warehouses, more trucks. No wonder the greenhouse gas 
emissions from transportation rose!
Manufacturers essentially warehouse their goods on the highways in tractor-
trailers. This approach wastes a lot of energy. For example, trucks that ship 
frozen goods really gobble up energy. Even if the trucker stops for the night, 
that truck has to keep running to prevent its goods from thawing.
Holding ______ accountable 
for air travel emissions
If you can fill in the blank, you can solve a global 
problem.
Air travel is tricky. It’s increasing rapidly, and 
there are more planes in the sky every year. 
But international air travel was left outside 
the Kyoto Protocol. The negotiators couldn’t 
agree on which country should be responsible 
for emissions — the country from which the 
airplane took off or the one where it landed. 
International flights tally up to over 350 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, accord-
ing to the International Energy Agency.
Government officials at international meetings 
still can’t figure out which countries to hold 
accountable for the emissions that result from 
shipping goods internationally, which is a total 
of over 450 metric tons of carbon dioxide annu-
ally. The European Union, however, is hoping 
to introduce legislation that will put emissions 
from air travel between EU airports under the 
EU emissions trading market by 2011.

79
 Chapter 5: Getting Right to the Source: The Big Emitters
Companies adopt just-in-time delivery because of the money it saves them; 
they don’t need to spend money warehousing goods. Although moving goods 
by truck increases congestion on highways, air pollution, traffic accidents, 
and (of course) greenhouse gas emissions, the companies don’t have to pay 
for these negative side effects.
If someone could persuade manufacturers to go back to shipping goods by 
rail, those manufacturers would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases 
they create. If countries modernized the rail freight system, using safer, more 
efficient tracks and cleaner-running engines, they’d reduce those greenhouse 
gases even more. They’d still need trucks for getting products from the trains 
to all the stores or suppliers within a region, but they could reduce the prac-
tice of long-haul trucking.
Draining Our Carbon Sinks: Land Use
Talking about how land use relates to giving off greenhouse gas emissions 
might seem a little odd, at first. After all, you don’t see corn crops or clear-
cut land puffing out greenhouse gas emissions like a factory smoke stack. The 
link between greenhouse gas emissions and land has to do with how plants 
and soil work together.
 
Plants and soil are major carbon sinks that soak up carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere. They take carbon dioxide out of the air and store it every day 
without us even noticing.
But when people cut down forests or over-till soil, carbon dioxide is released, 
not absorbed. In fact, in the last 50 years, the carbon dioxide emissions con-
nected to land use have doubled from 1 to 2 billion metric tons per year, 
according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In the 
following sections, we go into exactly why land use has increased carbon 
dioxide emissions so drastically.
Timber! Deforestation
Destroying forests is a major human cause of increased carbon dioxide con-
centrations. The IPCC reports that deforestation accounts for between 25 and 
30 percent of human greenhouse gas emission additions to the atmosphere, 
when trees are cleared for timber, farming, and land development. It stresses 
that the largest problems are deforestation in tropical regions and the ability 
for forests to re-grow in temperate regions.

80
Part II: Tracking Down the Causes 
 
Trees are carbon sinks — they suck carbon dioxide out of the air, hold onto 
the carbon, and release the oxygen back into the atmosphere. The fewer the 
trees, the less carbon dioxide gets drawn out of the air. Cutting down forests 
also damages the soil. Soil stores carbon, but when trees are removed, the 
soil becomes dryer and has more exposure to the air. When the carbon in the 
soil is exposed to the oxygen in the atmosphere, it produces carbon dioxide. 
(Check out to Chapter 2 for more information about carbon sinks.)
For many developing countries, deforestation accounts for their biggest 
source of greenhouse gases. These countries clear forests primarily to create 
land for farming, which causes even bigger problems because agriculture 
is another major source of greenhouse gases (see the following section 
for more on agriculture’s role in greenhouse gas emissions, and check out 
Chapter 12 for more about developing nations).
When a rainforest goes under the knife, it has a greater impact on climate 
change than a northern forest. For example, farmers are clearing large 
swathes of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil daily to make space for growing 
soybeans. As we talk about in Chapter 2, tropical rainforests are the most 
effective type of forest at sucking in carbon dioxide. When they get cut down, 
Earth loses a climate regulator. The picture gets bleaker still because these 
forests are often cleared by burning, which puts extra greenhouse gas emis-
sions into the atmosphere. So, when you think globally, you have to think 
about deforestation as a serious climate problem. Saving the Amazon isn’t 
just about protecting its amazing array of species. It’s about saving humanity.
For information about how industry can improve land management, check 
out Chapter 14.
Down on the farm: Agriculture 
and livestock
We all depend on agriculture to bring us our daily bread — but agriculture 
involves more than fields of wheat and crops of corn. Food crops are a big 
part of the agriculture equation, but agriculture also includes growing crops 
for fiber, such as cotton, and keeping animals for food and other products, 
such as wool. Of the land that humans use on the planet, 40 to 50 percent of 
it is used for agricultural practices, the IPCC reports.

81
 Chapter 5: Getting Right to the Source: The Big Emitters
Almost every step in agricultural processes produces greenhouse gases — 
from preparing the soil, to planting the crops, to harvesting the crops, to dis-
tributing the food. About 14 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions come 
from farming practices, according to the World Resources Institute.
 
Most farm-related carbon dioxide emissions come from how the soil is treated. 
When it’s tilled over and over, and exposed to the air, the carbon stored in the 
soil is exposed to oxygen in the air and forms carbon dioxide.
 
When calculating greenhouse gases, scientists don’t count agriculture’s 
carbon dioxide emissions. This carbon dioxide is considered neutral — the 
plants that farmers grow suck in just as much carbon dioxide as the agricul-
tural process releases. But scientists do count how much methane and nitrous 
oxide agriculture produces.
The IPCC reports that agriculture accounts for half of the world’s methane 
emissions and 60 percent of nitrous oxide emissions. Rice paddies alone 
account for a third of all methane emissions. Livestock, particularly cattle, 
represent another major source of methane. People in industrialized coun-
tries still eat four times as much beef as people in developing nations, but 
meat consumption in poorer nations is on the rise, which means more ani-
mals are being raised, boosting emissions. Regular field crops, such as corn 
and wheat, produce nitrous oxide emissions, thanks to the large amounts of 
fertilizer that farmers use to grow them. We talk about how agriculture can 
produce fewer emissions in Chapter 14, and look at how our individual food 
choices can help reduce agricultural emissions in Chapter 18.

onversations about the cause of global warming typically focus on 
the big offenders — the worst industries, dirtiest factories, and scoff-
law nations. There’s nothing wrong with that. But everyone plays a role in 
climate change. Each of us uses energy — specifically, fossil fuels — on a 
daily basis.
From the moment the alarm sounds on the clock radio in the morning until 
you shut off the TV at night, you’re connected to an electrical grid, often 
fueled by coal or oil. Everyone needs energy to move from here to there — 
a steady supply of gas for your car or diesel fuel for the bus you ride to 
work. Most of humanity’s food travels great distances before it arrives in 
our homes, a journey it undertakes thanks to greenhouse gas-producing 
fuels. (No wonder U.S. President George W. Bush said the U.S. is addicted 
to oil.)
Don’t allow yourself to feel depressed when you realize that your day-to-
day choices have been part of the global warming problem. The choices 
you made were heavily influenced by false pricing and a lack of support for 
the right choices. Still, the news that all our actions are part of the problem 
means that all our actions, making changes every day, can be a big part of the 
solution. If you want to read more on how you can help stop global warming,

led to faster and bigger cars. And the car transformed the culture of North 
America. Urban landscapes shifted from focusing on impressive architecture, 
street cars, and pedestrian access to giving planning preference to cars. 
Pedestrians and cyclists weren’t as important as parking lots and highways. 
Drive-throughs replaced the corner soda shop. Los Angeles, arguably the 
apex for car culture, even pioneered drive-through funeral parlors. North 
America’s love affair with the car changed everything — including the atmo-
sphere. Increasingly, the car is also becoming a “necessity” for large numbers 
of people in the developing world.
About 14 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions come from moving people 
and goods, according to the World Resources Institute. In Canada and the 
U.S., the proportion is higher — closer to one third of emissions come from 
transportation. Almost all our transportation — about 95 percent, says the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — runs on oil-based fuels 
such as diesel and gas, which explains why transportation accounts for such 
a large portion of overall emissions. Cars and diesel trucks are the top two 
offenders, but ships, airplanes, trains, and buses play a part, too. Figure 6-1 
shows the breakdown of how each mode of transportation contributes to 
greenhouse gas emissions. (Refer to Chapter 5 for more information about 
the problems related to shipping goods.)
Driving
A car engine runs on a simple combustion system. Each time you press on the 
accelerator, gas flows into the engine cylinder, where the spark plug ignites 
it. The piston goes down, and the crank shaft goes around and turns the 
wheels. That mini-explosion also creates exhaust fumes that get pushed out 
of the tailpipe. Those fumes include a healthy dose (figuratively speaking) 
of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydro-
carbons. The exhaust also contains carcinogens (such as benzene), volatile 
organic compounds (solvents that immediately evaporate into the air), carbon 
monoxide, and other nasties.
Whether you need to run errands or drive the kids to soccer practice, cars, 
minivans, and SUVs are useful and often perceived as necessary. Most house-
holds in industrialized countries own at least one car because most cities and 
housing developments are built around road infrastructure — making it dif-
ficult to survive without one. The majority of people in the developing world 
still don’t have access to a personal vehicle — but that’s quickly changing.

China is soaring ahead in private car ownership, which jumped by 33.5 per-
cent from 2005 to 2006, bringing the total to 11.49 million cars, according 
to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Nevertheless, with one billion 
people, China’s car population is far smaller than that of the United States.

Planes burn fuel similar to kerosene, which gives off more emissions than 
the gasoline in your family car. The IPCC estimates that commercial airline 
emissions account for 2 percent of worldwide CO2 emissions — not too bad, 
except that it’s expected to rise to 10 to 17 percent of total greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2050 at the rate humanity is globe-trotting. People made about 
4 billion individual plane trips in 2007, for business or pleasure, and civiliza-
tion is due to hit 5 billion trips a year in 2010 if it doesn’t change its ways.
With countries rapidly developing around the world, international arrivals 
increased from 800 million to 900 million in just two years, according to the 
United Nations World Tourism Organization. The people of China are just 
beginning to tour their own country. They’ll begin to travel and work abroad 
in great numbers soon. Experts predict that China will have 100 million out-
bound tourists annually by the year 2020, up from 12 million in 2001 and 20 
million in 2003. This 100 million would be fourth in the world, behind only the 
United States, Japan, and Germany.

Part II: Tracking Down the Causes 
Flights are becoming cheaper (some European airlines are even offering $1 
flights, for which the customer pays only the tax), and when they become 
cheaper, more of us are able to fly. Today, young adults commonly have 
flown internationally by the time they’re 25. Zoë flew often before she real-
ized the impact of her actions — amounting to a total of over 23 metric tons 
of greenhouse gases by the time she was 20. Good thing she carbon offsets 
(taxes herself by putting money into a project that will reduce emissions 
somewhere else) and now takes the train whenever she can. (Check out 
Chapter 17 for more about green travel options.)
 
Not only does flying emit a lot of greenhouse gases, it emits them in the atmo-
sphere in a more damaging way. The warming impact of the exhaust from air 
travel is far worse than the same volume of greenhouse gases emitted on the 
ground.
Using Energy Around the House
A man’s home is his castle. An outdated saying, but the idea that a home is 
a castle is getting truer and truer. In Canada and the United States, the floor 
space of the average home is growing while family size is shrinking. House 
size has real implications for the climate crisis. The bigger the home, the more 
energy required to heat, cool, and light it. Fewer people are occupying — and 
heating and cooling — more space.
When it comes to energy use in your home, you can think about it in two 
ways. First, your direct energy use comes from gas or fuel oil that you con-
sume directly — such as the oil-fed heaters or propane gas stoves you may 
have in your home. And then electricity is sometimes called indirect energy 
because some other energy — oil, hydroelectric, wind, or nuclear power — is 
used to produce it. How your electricity is produced affects your individual 
greenhouse gas emissions.
The energy that people use in their homes accounts for 10 percent of green-
house gas emissions around the world, according to the World Resources 
Institute. Most of the energy you use directly goes toward heating your home. 
You use most of your electricity to power your lighting and appliances.
See Figure 6-2 for a complete breakdown of the percentages of greenhouse 
gas emissions produced from heating, lighting, and other energy uses.
Your energy use may be very different than the average home. For example, 
you may not have an air conditioner. In Chapter 18, we look at ways to find 
out where you’re using the most energy and electricity, and what you can do 
to lower your energy use and reduce your dependence on fossil fuels (and 
save some cash).

Climate control
Homes in the U.S. create 150 million metric tons of carbon dioxide every year 
from heating and cooling alone for 300 million people, according to the U.S. 
Department of Energy. That’s as much energy as Argentina, with 40 million 
people, uses in one year for absolutely everything.
Heating
Heating takes either direct energy or electricity, depending on whether you 
have an oil or gas furnace or electrical baseboard heaters. Other types of 
home heating, such as wood stoves or gas fireplaces, also create emissions. 
The IPCC notes that burning wood for home heating (and in some countries, 
cooking, as well) accounts for over 10 percent of energy use in the world. 
Burning wood adds to greenhouse gas emissions both through the carbon 
dioxide released during burning and through deforestation.
Older furnaces emit more greenhouse gases than newer models. These old 
clunkers guzzle fossil fuels, but unfortunately, many homeowners cling to 
them, worried about the expense of buying a new unit. In reality, these home-
owners can save money if they buy a new energy-efficient furnace, which 
would save them significantly on energy costs — and be less costly to the 
planet, too.
Cooling
Electricity used to be used only for keeping the lights on. Now, it’s what 
keeps us cool all summer long. In fact, the largest share of home electricity 
use now goes directly to air conditioning. And in places such as south central 
Canada, the greater share of power demand has recently shifted from winter to 
summer. With more 86 degrees F (30 degrees C) days every summer — thanks 
to global warming — the demand for air conditioning goes up annually.

88
Part II: Tracking Down the Causes 
Only industrialized countries used air conditioning, for the most part, until 
now. Recent news reports show that sales of home air conditioners have 
tripled in the last ten years in China. While countries such as China and India 
move to catch up to industrialized countries, residents are starting to widely 
use luxuries such as air conditioning. Add warming temperatures into the 
mix, and you can see a growing air-conditioning trend and a growing demand 
for electricity to meet that desire.
Traditionally, most Europeans never considered air conditioning. But 
because killer heat waves have ravaged Europe in recent years, this perspec-
tive is changing. For example, the U.K. had to consider new labor laws. In the 
past, England had laws to ensure a legal minimum temperature so workers 
could stay warm enough. Because of intense summer heat, they’ve also had 
to consider legal maximum temperatures!
Perhaps the most surprising area to need air conditioning is in Canada’s far 
north. Buildings in the Northwest Territories and the Yukon are now being 
built with air conditioning. The average high temperature in the summer in 
those territories ranges from 70 to 80 degrees F (in the 20s C), but has been 
warming up recently and has reached the 90s F (about 30 degrees C).
Electric appliances
Think of every gadget in your home that needs to be plugged in. Actually, 
it might be easier to think of the things that you don’t have to plug in. 
How green is your electricity?
When it comes to electricity-related emissions, 
how much you produce depends very much on 
where you live. If your electricity comes from 
coal- or oil-fired plants, your electricity use 
makes a substantial addition to the atmosphere’s 
greenhouse gases. You can find coal plants 
all over the world, but they’re mostly in China, 
India, and the United States. Some regions, 
however, don’t create very much carbon diox-
ide because they generate electricity by using 
energy sources such as hydroelectric, wind, 
and nuclear power. Canada and Europe have 
most of the large nuclear and hydroelectric 
plants. Germany is far ahead in wind power, 
making up almost a quarter of all installed wind 
power capacity in the world. The United States, 
Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands are also 
leaders in wind-generated electricity.
Wherever you are in the world, you can go 
and search for your power provider at www.
carma.org. This Web site can also show 
you how much energy your power provider 
produces, how clean the energy source is, and 
how many tons of carbon dioxide it gives off.
Chapter 13 covers a lot of the exciting energy 
alternatives out there.

89
 Chapter 6: Taking It Personally: Individual Sources of Emissions
Every time-saving device and appliance makes you more reliant on the 
energy grid.
The refrigerator is the biggest electricity hog in your house — the standard 
fridge, purchased within the last ten years, can use 120 to 170 kilowatt hours 
(KWH) a month. (By contrast, a new energy-efficient fridge can use less than 
400 KWH per year.)
Smaller appliances add up, too — who’d have thought that you can link 
toasting your waffles to climate change? Your vacuum, microwave, hair 
dryer, electric kettle, and coffee machine — even your toaster — all matter. 
Maybe they don’t require all that much energy, but you use them almost 
every day.
Even when you turn your appliances off, many of them are still on! The auto-
matic instant-on features on garage door openers, televisions, and so many 
gadgets pull power while they wait for you to need them. Manufacturers 
could make these appliances so that they demand only a fraction of the 
energy — and California has enacted regulations to insist they draw less 
power. The California Energy Commission discovered these little instant-on 
devices used up to as much as 10 percent of home electricity demand! If you 
don’t live in California, your best bet is to unplug televisions, computers, and 
other electronics when you’re not using them. (Or have them all plugged into 
one power bar that you can turn off with one switch.)
We Are What We Eat: Food and Carbon
Like a warm home in freezing weather, food is a necessity, not a luxury. But 
sadly, when people sought to make food more accessible and more conve-
nient, and to offer a greater variety, they often did so without considering the 
environmental toll their innovations might have.
Much of the food that people buy at the grocery store uses a lot of energy to 
get there — and creates a lot of greenhouse gas emissions as a result. Here 
are some of the key offenders:
 
 Frozen food: Whether you’re talking refrigerated or frozen, these foods 
burn energy when they’re made, while they’re being transported, and 
even when they’re sitting in a freezer or cooler in the grocery store (or 
in your home). The most-energy-used-per-serving prize goes to freeze-
dried coffee.
 
 Processed and packaged food: Moving these foods through the produc-
tion line takes energy, as does making the packaging. (Not to mention 
the emissions that come from all that packaging when it ends up in a 
landfill.)

90
Part II: Tracking Down the Causes 
 
 Food from afar: Elizabeth never even saw a kiwi until she was about 
18 years old. Her daughter started asking for them for her school lunch 
in first grade. You may enjoy strawberries and mangoes in the dead 
of winter, when you can’t pick fresh fruit right in your backyard, but 
moving exotic fruits and veggies around the world by plane, ship, and 
truck has a real cost in energy. Could people afford them if companies 
factored in the cost to the climate? And why should your apple be more 
well-traveled than you?
 
 Meat products: Feeding livestock takes an average of 10 pounds of grain — 
grain that plays a large role in agricultural emissions — to produce 1 pound 
of meat. (That fact alone made Zoë adopt a largely vegetarian lifestyle.) 
Also, when people eat more meat, more land is needed to raise livestock, 
which often means clearing forests and losing trees that breathe in our 
carbon dioxide. (Chapter 5 takes a look at farming, and Chapter 18 goes 
over food solutions.)
Wasting Away
The industrialized world isn’t really a “waste not, want not” culture. It’s more 
“Shop till you drop!” And people do shop, creating huge amounts of waste in 
the process.
 
Since World War II, household waste from the average U.S. and Canadian 
home has increased greatly. Over the past 45 years, people in the United 
States have gone from producing 2.7 pounds (1.2 kg) of waste a day to 4.6 
pounds (2.1 kg) a day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Key 
Note Market Assessments (a primary research group providing strategic anal-
ysis reports) predicts that worldwide municipal waste production will grow 
37 percent between 2007 and 2011.
Changes in marketing and merchandising have significantly added to packag-
ing. Elizabeth is old enough to remember when you went to a local hardware 
store if you needed nails for a home building project. The person behind the 
counter would put the nails in a paper bag and weigh them. Zoë’s nail-buying 
experiences have been in modern, barn-like, hardware emporiums. To reduce 
staff and make shoplifting harder, such stores invented the dreaded bubble-
pack approach. To buy a few nails, you buy a big piece of cardboard encased 
in hard plastic that defies any opening technique except a major attack with 
scissors. Multiply that packaging approach by a zillion, and you can see how 
our society wastes so much energy in packaging and why the garbage is 
piling up.

91
 Chapter 6: Taking It Personally: Individual Sources of Emissions
About 5 percent of worldwide emissions come from waste, according to the 
IPCC. Landfills rot, adding methane and carbon dioxide to the air. Sewage 
water is another source of methane — and it adds a dose of nitrous oxide 
to the mix. Anything that you throw in the trash ratchets up the amount of 
methane in the landfill, even items such as broken furniture, old toys, and 
shoes. In some provinces in Canada, coffee cups make up more than a quar-
ter of all materials in the landfill.
Developing countries consume far less per capita, but that doesn’t mean they 
don’t have a garbage problem. In fact, it’s a different kind of problem — many 
countries have garbage but no funds for garbage collection or landfills, let 
alone the luxury of recycling plants. While developing countries are industri-
alizing and building their economies, they’re helping increase the amount of 
waste made in the world. Their wallets are growing, but so are their garbage 
piles — following in the footsteps of developed countries around the world.
The fast, cheap, and high-emission solution is to simply burn the waste. But 
burning waste builds up greenhouse gas emissions even further, putting us 
into a dizzying cycle. Because the volume of waste that civilization produces 
keeps rising, it has to come up with new ways to deal with it. Many great 
technologies enable humanity to process garbage back into what closely 
resembles dirt after only a few years. We go over ways to reduce the amount 
of garbage you produce in Chapter 18.

ajor natural disasters have always happened. Storms, hurricanes, 
floods, and droughts are all part of the planet’s natural weather and 
climate system.
In the future, however, humanity is going to be facing more and more intense 
versions of these phenomena — and they’re going to be anything but natural 
disasters. Civilization — or more properly, the greenhouse gases (refer to 
Chapter 2) that civilization pumps into the atmosphere — will bring them 
on. Earth could be facing more droughts, hurricanes, and forest fires, heavier 
rainfalls, rising sea levels, and major heat waves. The excess carbon dioxide 
that people put into the air might even disrupt the carbon cycle and turn the 
planet’s life-support system into a vicious cycle.
Don’t panic, though — you don’t need to rush out and build the ark just yet. 
But this chapter does offer you some very good reasons why civilization 
needs to start lowering its emissions to cool off global warming.
H2 Oh No: Watery Disasters
Welcome to the blue planet. Water covers more than 70 percent of Earth’s 
surface. And because of global warming, you might be seeing a lot more of it. 
Or less. It all depends on where you live.

96
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
The relationship between global warming and water is complex. Thanks to 
rising temperatures, some Antarctic ice is melting and raising sea levels. 
Elsewhere, glacial melt plays a major role in replenishing the freshwater 
supply to adjacent farm areas in the spring. As glaciers disappear, this water 
will disappear, too, increasing drought and water scarcity. Rainfall patterns 
are altering. Drought is becoming more common.
Rising sea levels
When the planet heats up, sea levels rise for two reasons:
 
 Antarctic and Greenland ice caps melt into the water. (When ice at the 
Arctic melts, it does not change sea levels but does change the water’s 
salinity, or saltiness.)
 
 Water expands when it warms.
Even if you take melting polar ice caps out of the picture, sea levels would 
still rise over the next few centuries up to about 1.3 feet (0.4 meters) for 
every degree Celsius (1.8 degree Fahrenheit) of temperature change.
Because the majority of the world’s population lives along coasts, rising sea 
levels are one of the most pressing potential effects of climate change. The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that sea levels 
will rise 7.1 inches to 1.9 feet (0.1 to 0.59 meter) by the year 2100 from both 
expanding water and melting ice — but this estimate could grow if ice begins 
melting faster than it is now.
 
Although this predicted increase might not seem like a lot, it’s enough to 
cover large parts of not only the Maldives (an island nation in the Indian 
Ocean, which is a scant 1 to 2 meters, or 3.28 to 6.56 feet, above sea level), 
but also the island state of Tuvalu, 4 to 5 meters (13.12 to 16.4 feet) above sea 
level. Hundreds of inhabited island nations fear disappearing below the water 
line.
Figure 7-1 shows that sea levels were steady throughout the 1800s, but that 
our increased carbon emissions took a rapid toll at the dawn of the 20th cen-
tury. The right side of the figure shows that the pace is expected to only pick 
up from here.
Global warming is causing the sea levels to rise in two main ways. First, when 
Earth’s temperature goes up, its water warms — and warmer water takes up 
more space than colder water. Essentially, the climate change is causing the 
ocean to expand. Melting ice also plays a role in the rise of sea levels. Extra 
water from melting glaciers and ice sheets is flowing into the oceans. Two

areas, in particular, can potentially cause major world changes: the western 
Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet. If either ice sheet were to 
collapse, the IPCC estimates that sea level would jump from a predicted 1.9 
feet (0.6 meters) by 2100 to 13.1 to 16.4 feet (4 to 5 meters), flooding coastal 
communities and cities around the world.
Surprisingly, melting sea ice doesn’t affect sea levels. The water created by 
melting sea ice is equal in volume to the ice that was once there. Melting Arctic 
ice, for example, can impact the strength of ocean currents, such as the Gulf 
Stream, which could potentially have a serious impact on the climate, but it 
wouldn’t cause sea levels to rise. On the other hand, if enough land ice melts, 
and that water makes its way into the oceans, sea levels will rise.
Consider the western Antarctic ice sheet — an enormous body of ice that’s 
the size of the state of Texas and contains nearly 10 percent of all the ice 
in the world. The on-land portion of this ice sheet appears to be weakening 
because meltwater is working its way underneath and lubricating the base of 
the glacier, which speeds up its slide towards the ocean. As for the ice over 
the water, the warming water temperatures directly under it are causing the 
melting. It’s not likely, but it is possible, that this ice sheet could collapse. 
If that happens, the IPCC estimates that sea level rise would jump from a 
predicted 1.9 feet (0.59 meters) by 2100 to 13.1 to 16.4 feet (4 to 5 meters), 
putting coastal communities and cities around the world at risk of flooding.

98
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
 
Greenland is also covered by a massive ice sheet, and it’s also warming far 
more rapidly than scientists initially anticipated. The World Meteorological 
Organization reports that “melting glaciers in Greenland have revealed 
patches of land exposed for the first time in millions of years.” The ice 
in Greenland is more than 1.86 miles (3 kilometers) thick in some spots. 
Greenland’s ice cover can vary from year to year, depending on the amount 
of snowfall and other natural weather conditions, but since the 1970s, the ice 
sheet has experienced a net loss of ice. NASA (the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration) reports that the rate of ice loss has doubled in the past 
ten years in Greenland (see Figure 7-2).
Melting mountain glaciers
Mountain glaciers are large masses of ice carrying rocks and dirt that usually 
exist at very high altitudes. Glaciers build up from snowfall over very long 
periods of time. In the spring and summer, glaciers start to slowly melt, and 
the water runs off into nearby rivers and lakes. See Figure 7-3 for a photo of a 
mountain glacier.
The IPCC reports that 75 percent of people in the world rely on freshwater 
from mountain glaciers. In India, for example, a quarter of a billion people 
depend on a single glacier-fed river.

 Chapter 7: Not-So-Natural Disasters
New opportunities and challenges in the Arctic
Melting northern ice will open up new shipping 
routes such as the Northwest Passage, which 
was completely ice-free for the first time in the 
summer of 2007. Shipping between the Atlantic 
and Pacific oceans may soon become business 
as usual. This additional access that the new 
routes provide has also made oil exploration by 
ship much easier.
The idea that losing the Arctic ice is “good 
news” is disturbing given the knock on effects 
from melting ice. The industry excitement to 
obtain even more fossil fuels to speed more 
climate change from under the melting ice sug-
gests a worrying denial of the seriousness of 
the climate change threat.
But even for those who want more oil and gas, 
the melting Arctic is not all good news. The 
Arctic Climate Assessment Council reports that 
the time available each year for land-based 
oil exploration has been cut in half because of 
the warming permafrost (see the section “The 
Negative Side Effects of Positive Feedback 
Loops,” in this chapter, for more on the impact 
of melting permafrost). Open water is heat-
ing up questions of sovereignty among the 
countries bordering the Arctic Circle — who 
controls which waters, and are these newly 
opened areas the high seas or coastal waters? 
Additionally, oil exploration brings the risk of 
spills and other ecological disasters that would 
harm the fragile Arctic ecosphere.
When this Arctic ice melts, more coastline 
is exposed, increasing erosion. Erosion also 
reduces the natural barriers to storm surges. 
This melting ice is very bad news for indigenous 
communities that live in the affected areas. We 
go over the effects that these major Arctic 
changes have on plants and animals in Chapter 
8 and the effects on people in Chapter 9.
Unfortunately, global warming is endangering those water sources. Glaciers 
are melting more quickly in the spring, releasing a lot of water at once, 
rather than a smaller, steady flow. This rapid melting can mean floods in the 
spring,because glacial lakes can’t hold all that water at once, and drought in 
late summer, because the water has drained away. This heavy early runoff 
will probably also overload the capacity of rivers and streams, eroding their 
banks and potentially flooding small delta areas with muddy water. Because 
300 million people in the world live in deltas, this is a cause for concern (see 
Chapter 9 for more effects on people).
In addition to accelerating glaciers’ melting, higher temperatures are causing 
most glaciers to retreat. Previously, in colder weather, snow would restore 
most of the ice that glaciers lost because of melting. But now, because the 
cold weather doesn’t last as long, the glaciers don’t get as much snow as 
they used to. Every year, more ice melts than gets replaced, so the glaciers 
are shrinking. Glaciers have always advanced and receded, but in the past, 
they did so veeeeerrry slowly (a few centimeters or an inch a year). Warmer 
weather is changing that.

Mountain glaciers around the world are disappearing, from Patagonia 
to Kilimanjaro, from the Rockies to the European Alps. For example, the 
18,000-year-old Chacaltaya glacier in Bolivia has lost 80 percent of its ice area 
in just 20 years. When Zoë visited nearby the site in 2007, hardly anything 
was left of it. Glaciers all along the Andes have been the main source of water 
for cities such as La Paz for centuries. The retreat of most glaciers is a clear 
physical indication that the world is getting warmer. 
Putting a brake on the Gulf Stream
The ocean is always moving. It’s not just the tides — a whole system of cur-
rents moves water in regular patterns around the world (see Figure 7-4).
Oceans have currents because water varies in density. Cold water is more 
dense, so it sinks, and warm water is less dense, so it floats. (When you go 
swimming in a lake, the top is always warmer.) Similarly, saltwater sinks, and 
freshwater floats. Winds move the top layer of the ocean, which then — simply 
by friction — moves the layers below it. This combination of temperature, 
salinity, and wind keeps the currents moving. Meltwater from Greenland, the 
Arctic, and Antarctica is affecting the ocean currents (check out the section 
“Rising sea levels,” earlier in this chapter, for more information about this 
melting ice). When this freshwater is released into the oceans, it dilutes the 
ocean’s saltiness. The less-salty water no longer sinks quickly, which can 
potentially slow the currents.

The Gulf Stream, located in the upper half of the Atlantic Ocean, is part of 
the overall ocean current system. (If you saw the movie Finding Nemo, it’s 
the sea highway that all the turtles and fish cruise along.) The Gulf Stream 
brings nice warm water from the Gulf of Mexico up past northern Europe. 
The heat from the ocean warms the air around Europe, which helps explain 
why Europe tends to be warmer than Canada or Russia, even though it’s at 
the same latitude. After the ocean releases all its warmth on Europe, it con-
tinues its route to sweep past chilly Greenland before coming over to Canada 
(bringing Canada cold air). Figure 7-5 shows the Gulf Stream in action.

Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
Some scientists suggest that, over time, the Gulf Stream could slow or even 
stall because of all the extra freshwater being added to the oceans. The maga-
zine Nature recently published research findings from a study done at 25 
degrees north in the Atlantic ocean that suggests the Gulf Stream has already 
slowed down by 30 percent since the last time they checked in the 1950s. The 
Gulf Stream could stall by 2010.
If the Gulf Stream slows or stops, Europe might start cooling. Sounds tempt-
ing because of Earth’s rising temperatures — but scientists say that the 
climate changes triggered by a Gulf Stream disruption would be overall bad 
news for Europe, unaccustomed to cold winter weather, as well as to the rest 
of the world. Changing the way the currents work could change how well the 
ocean sucks up carbon dioxide from the air. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more 
about the ocean’s role as a carbon sink.)
 
Reports by the IPCC, however, show that the Gulf Stream probably won’t stall 
in this century. But scientists still know very little about how climate change 
will affect the Gulf Stream.

 Chapter 7: Not-So-Natural Disasters
Rainfall (or lack thereof)
Changes in temperature are altering evaporation and precipitation patterns, 
which means more rain in some places and less in others. The IPCC says 
these changes also mean more intense dry spells and rainstorms overall, 
with high-latitude areas in Europe, Russia, and Canada taking the hardest 
drenching.
The IPCC reports that inland mid-latitude regions — such as central Canada 
and inland Europe and Asia — are generally most at risk from more frequent 
and harsher droughts than what those areas currently experience. Although 
not in those regions, the land along the Mediterranean in Europe may also 
experience increased droughts. Droughts and high temperatures put major 
stress on forests and grasslands; dry, parched vegetation is a fire waiting 
to happen. The soil suffers, too. Dried out soil can release into the air the 
carbon that it used to store. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more about how soil 
contributes to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.) Drought is hard on people 
and animals, because all living things depend on water.
Deserts around the world are expanding. The Gobi desert in China, for exam-
ple, is approaching Beijing — China is already 30 percent desert, expected 
to soon become 40 percent. Although expanding deserts are a natural 
phenomenon and not directly linked to global warming, the combination 
of increasing desert area and droughts can have negative effects of stress-
ing freshwater sources and food production. The IPCC reports that the duo 
of natural warming and human-caused warming has caused the number of 
dry areas around the world to double since the 1970s. China is working to 
combat the expansion of the desert by planting forests.
Flooding
Three climate change consequences lead to flooding: rising sea levels, 
quicker-melting snow and glaciers, and more intense rain showers. The IPCC 
expects that the rising sea levels and harsher rainstorms will increase the 
number of floods in many places, including both flash floods (floods that 
happen very suddenly, often because of heavy rainfall and/or the ground is 
so dry it can’t quickly absorb the rain) and large-scale floods (floods that stick 
around for a while, caused either by prolonged rainfall or water that can’t 
drain away easily).
It is quite typical of climate change scenarios to predict that average annual 
precipitation will remain nearly constant, but that areas will experience long 
periods of drought followed by an enormous volume of rain. A good example 
of this occurred in Mozambique when a persistent drought lasting months 

104
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
immediately preceded the torrential rains of 2000. That nation’s annual pre-
cipitation fell within days on the dry and desiccated lands.
The most likely areas to experience more flooding are high-latitude countries, 
such as the United Kingdom.
At the time this book went to press, the IPCC saw increased flooding as a 
future event. At this point, scientists can’t blame existing levels of climate 
change for any major changes in flooding, but it may only be a few more 
years before scientists trace the recent floods to climate change.
Freshwater contamination
Most of the creatures that walk (or crawl or slither) on the planet require 
freshwater (water that isn’t salty) to survive. Unfortunately, flooding and 
rising sea levels, two of the effects of climate change, pose two contamination 
risks to freshwater:
 
 Getting it dirty: Runoff from flooding can get into drinking water. This 
runoff washes over city streets and can take anything with it — from any 
dirt or garbage in the streets, to overflowing sewer systems, to pesti-
cides and fertilizers from our lawns.
 
 Getting it salty: The higher sea levels mean saltwater intrusions. Not 
only can saltwater get into fresh surface water, it can also work its way 
down into aquifers (water-bearing rock, which can provide well water) 
and coastal freshwater rivers. More people live along coastlines than 
any other region, and those people have the fewest sources of freshwa-
ter. Seawater contamination will only worsen that state of affairs.
Stormy Weather: More Intense 
Storms and Hurricanes
You may have heard about stronger storms and hurricanes as an effect of 
global warming, either on the news or from watching Al Gore’s documentary 
An Inconvenient Truth.
Global warming is heating up our oceans. In fact, the IPCC reports that 
oceans have absorbed about 80 percent of the heat from global warming. 
Hurricanes are now occurring in the top half of the northern hemisphere, 
such as Canada, because of these warmer ocean temperatures, particularly 
at the surface. Historically, colder ocean surface temperatures in the north 
slowed down hurricanes, turning them into powerful, but nowhere near as 

105
 Chapter 7: Not-So-Natural Disasters
destructive, tropical storms. Now, however, the water’s warmer tempera-
tures don’t impede storms. In fact, warming up surface water is like revving 
the hurricane’s engine.
The number of tropical storms and hurricanes hasn’t increased. In fact, that 
number has stayed fairly uniform over the past 40 years, the IPCC reports. 
The intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes, however, has increased. 
For example, eight Atlantic Category 5 hurricanes have occurred so far this 
decade; no other decade on record has had so many. Hurricanes hit Canada’s 
two major coastal cities, Halifax on the east coast and Vancouver on the 
west, in 2003 and 2006, respectively. In fact, 2003’s Hurricane Juan was the 
first full-force tropical hurricane ever to hit Atlantic Canada.
These bigger storms and hurricanes bring rougher coastal storms, bigger 
storm surges, higher water levels, taller waves, more storm damage, and 
flooding. Some storm-protection barriers might not be strong enough to pro-
tect against the hurricanes that are coming, and some cities might need to 
reevaluate their protection. (Think New Orleans!)
#

The most recent science shows that storm and hurricane intensity has grown 
around the world since 1970. This rising intensity is linked to rising ocean 
surface temperatures. But some scientists have challenged these data because 
they’re not in line with climate models; in fact, some climate models predict 
that storms and hurricanes are about to become less intense. Despite this 
disagreement, people are better to be safe than sorry when so much is on the 
line. Protecting humanity means reducing greenhouse gas emission immedi-
ately as well as better preparing for storms by building better protections and 
improving our response to natural disaster emergencies.
Forest Fires: If a Tree Dries Out 
in the Forest
As we discuss in Chapter 2, forests are critical in keeping excess carbon diox-
ide out of our atmosphere. Unfortunately, the number of forest fires is greatly 
increasing, and global warming is the cause.
The increase in hot, dry weather means dryer forests, ideal fodder for fire. 
Forest fires around the world last longer and burn with more intensity than 
previously recorded. The area of land burned by wildfires has surged in the 
past 30 years across North America. The IPCC reports that a one-degree 
Celsius rise (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in average temperatures can increase 
the length of the fire season in northern Asia by 30 percent.

106
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
These fires have serious consequences, not only for the environment, but 
also for infrastructure. Major wildfires in Canberra, Australia, in 2003 ruined 
500 houses and cost a hefty 261 million dollars (U.S.) in damage alone. The 
2007 fires across the state of California destroyed 1,500 homes. The IPCC 
expects forest fires to increase while temperatures continue to rise and some 
areas experience reduced rainfall.
Warmer weather also means more pine beetles in the western U.S. and 
Canada. The pine beetle is an insect that has a special talent for turning a 
forest into firewood. Previously, pine beetles didn’t survive the winter. Now, 
their numbers grow annually. (See Chapter 8 to get better acquainted with 
pine beetles.)
The increasing numbers of pine beetles have significantly affected interior 
British Columbia, where Zoë grew up. The Montane forest, where lodgepole 
pine predominates, has lost an area of forest the size of two Swedens because 
of climate-induced beetle attacks.
In fact, because of both fire and increased insect damage, forests in Canada 
ceased to be a net sink (refer to Chapter 2) for carbon in the mid-1970s. 
Canada’s forests still hold millions of tons of carbon, but on an annual basis, 
these forests now give off more carbon than they suck in. Adding to this 
vicious cycle, forest fires pump carbon dioxide into the air when the wood 
burns and releases the gas.
Turning Up the Heat
You may think that we’re just stating the obvious when we say that global 
warming will bring about more hot days and warm nights. But those hot 
days can be fatal, particularly when they constitute a heat wave, a prolonged 
period of very hot weather. In fact, in both the U.S. and Europe, heat waves 
kill more people each year than tornadoes, floods, and hurricanes combined. 
An estimated 35,000 people died in Europe because of extreme heat waves in 
the summer of 2003. During a five-day heat wave in Chicago in July 1995, sev-
eral hundred died. You don’t necessarily hear about other heat waves: Many 
countries across Africa have been enduring heat waves that last for longer 
periods of time than they have in the past.
High temperatures can mean high stress on the body, particularly heat-
stroke. Heatstroke, in extreme cases, can lead to chronic illness and some-
times death (see Chapter 9 for more on global warming’s effects on people). 
Society’s most vulnerable — the poor, the elderly, and (especially) the 
elderly poor are usually the victims of killer heat.

107
 Chapter 7: Not-So-Natural Disasters
Heat waves also claim livestock. Heat stress can lower livestock’s ability to 
reproduce and increase mortality rates. News reports show that the 2006 
heat wave that hit California killed 25,000 cattle and 700,000 chickens and 
turkeys.
Unfortunately, the future of heat waves is scorching. Heat waves will con-
tinue to get more intense and last longer each time they occur. Los Angeles 
can expect its regular 12 days of heat waves per year to jump to between 44 
and 95 days of heat waves a year by 2070 to 2099.
And when people want to cool off, they’re adding to another problem — air 
conditioning and refrigerators working overtime commonly raise the amount 
of electricity used in cities during heat waves. Climate change will raise peak 
energy demands because people will reach for the air-conditioning dial, 
making conservation efforts more difficult.
The Negative Side Effects 
of Positive Feedback Loops
 
The carbon cycle, which we talk about in Chapter 2, is like our planet’s respi-
ratory system. Some organisms emit carbon, and others breathe it in. When 
the carbon cycle is balanced (as we know it), it’s a natural wonder, ensuring 
that the air doesn’t contain an excess of carbon dioxide.
When the carbon cycle goes off-kilter because of too many carbon emitters 
and too few carbon absorbers, it could prove disastrous. Climatologists fear 
that an imbalanced carbon cycle will create positive feedback loops. A posi-
tive feedback loop is anything but good news, even if it does have the word 
“positive” in its name. In a positive feedback loop, effects are perpetually 
amplified. In the case of the carbon cycle, constantly escalating carbon emis-
sions cause ever-increasing temperatures. If the feedback loops accelerate, 
there is a theoretical possibility of a run-away greenhouse effect.
A dim hope to fight global warming
When a great deal of particulate matter — such 
as volcanic ash, dust, pollution, and gas from 
aerosols — prevents some of the sun’s light from 
reaching Earth, it’s referred to as global dimming. 
For a while, scientists hoped that global dim-
ming might help correct global warming — less 
sunlight reaching the Earth would cool things down 
considerably. But NASA reported in 2006 that the 
amount of particulate matter in the atmosphere is 
decreasing — which could be due to the effect 
of stricter air quality regulations on industry — 
so more of the sun’s light reaches the planet.

108
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
Here’s an example of the run-away greenhouse effect in action: A high 
amount of human-produced carbon dioxide in the atmosphere intensifies the 
greenhouse effect, leading to higher temperatures that melt the once perma-
nently frozen ground (known as permafrost) in the Arctic. That frozen ground 
has been a greenhouse gas reservoir for thousands of years, storing methane 
that it releases into the atmosphere when it melts. And that additional meth-
ane heats things up even more, which causes more carbon emissions. (You 
can see how this situation gets into a worsening loop.)
The same kind of vicious cycle happens when Arctic ice melts. When the ice 
is present, the sun strikes the white surface and bounces back, just like a 
mirror reflecting light. You know the handy trick for dressing on hot days? 
White clothing keeps you cooler because white reflects the sun’s rays, and 
black clothing soaks in the heat. Well, Arctic scientists call this the albedo 
effect.
When the ice melts, dark ocean water replaces it. The dark ocean water 
doesn’t reflect the sunlight. (Just like your black t-shirt doesn’t keep you 
cool.) It soaks in the heat, warming ocean water even faster and melting 
the ice more quickly, which leads to more open water and more warming. 
Warmer waters might also mean that other organisms can thrive where they 
haven’t before, pushing out algae and lowering the amount of carbon dioxide 
being sucked up. Figure 7-6 shows the sizeable contrast between the white 
ice and the comparably black water — you can imagine how much more heat 
the water absorbs than the ice does.
Positive feedback loops also apply when forests catch fire because of warm 
and dry conditions. Those burning forests release the stored carbon in 
their branches, trunks, and leaves, adding to the carbon dioxide in the atmo-
sphere. That additional carbon dioxide leads to more warming and dryer 
conditions, which lead to more forest fires.
Not so permanent
Unfortunately, some permafrost is already melt-
ing in the western Arctic of Canada and Russia’s 
Siberia. When permafrost melts, it releases into 
the atmosphere methane gas that had been 
stored for thousands of years. The melting 
alone is bad news for local people. Roads col-
lapse when the ground subsides. Houses and 
even villages have had to be relocated.
The Inuit — indigenous people of the cir-
cumpolar region, known largely as Inupiat 
Eskimo in Alaska and Inuit in Canada and 
Greenland — used to put foods that needed 
refrigeration into the permafrost, but they 
can no longer do that because the ground is 
warming up and the permafrost is disappear-
ing. Their natural fridge is defrosting.

of the greenhouse gas methane, a 
by-product of decomposition of organic
material in the melted permafrost layer.

The warming of Earth is most
felt by people in urban areas, 
who use additional air

the burning of fossil fuels, which
in turn releases additional
carbon dioxide into the
environment and results in
additional climate change.
 
Some scientists worry that if humanity doesn’t dramatically reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, the positive feedback loops could take over. If the positive 
feedback loops take control, reservoirs of carbon that represent thousands of 
years’ worth of carbon sucked from the atmosphere would rapidly release their 
greenhouse gases. A run-away greenhouse effect could, theoretically, end life 
on Earth. Humanity has only a short time to avoid global average temperature 
rise to over 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above 1850 at which 
point the risk of a run-away climate impact becomes dangerously likely.

S
ome people call it nature. Some talk about the birds and the bees, all 
creatures great and small. Others talk about flora and fauna. Scientists 
call the living things on Earth, from the genetic level to the landscape level, 
biodiversity.
Biodiversity is also called “biological diversity” — the planet’s variety of living 
species. The world is abundant with diversity, from the deep forests of China, 
to the mountains of Canada, to the icy waters of Antarctica.
Biodiversity is affected by a deep matrix of issues — ranging from the impact 
of people, to the way species interact with each other, to changes in the 
environment around communities. Climate change has become another issue 
added to the mix.
The United Nations Convention for the Protection of Biological Diversity 
has identified climate change as a threat to biodiversity. While the natural 
world becomes increasingly threatened, the way humans use and interact 
with plants and animals will change. More or less, all the living things on the 
planet are in this together. In this chapter, we look at what kind of pressure 
climate change is putting on the Earth’s biodiversity, whether organisms 
can adapt to these changes, and which plants and animals will likely be 
most affected.

112
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
Understanding the Stresses 
on Ecosystems
If you’ve ever watched a nature program on television, you know that the 
natural world isn’t the most peaceful of places, with predators mercilessly 
chasing down prey. But if you’ve been out on a hike, nature may appear to 
actually be a pretty harmonious, finely balanced arrangement. The relation-
ships of living creatures with each other, the land, and the climate within a 
particular area are known as an ecosystem.
Ecosystems can be highly adaptable. For hundreds of millions of years, the 
Earth’s ecosystems have adapted to changing climates, responding to differ-
ences in rainfall, shifting temperatures, available land, and even changes in 
the levels of carbon dioxide in the air. But now, climate change is occurring 
at such a rapid pace that many species likely won’t be able to adapt, and 
entire ecosystems may be transformed.
Worse still, global warming is happening in combination with many other 
human-created pressures on ecosystems. With 6.5 billion people on the 
planet, and on the way to 9 billion people by 2050, ecosystems are under 
much greater pressure than they ever were before. If you’ve ever looked out 
the window of a plane while flying over land, you’ve seen manmade patches 
and lines across the land — patches for developments such as cities, farming, 
and logging; and lines for structures such as highways, roads, and railroad 
tracks. Every patch or line that people make fragments the natural ecosys-
tems. Often, people conserve a patch of forest, but human development 
surrounds that forest, so the plants and animals must rely on each other in 
that reduced area, allowing less room for adaptation. Air and water pollution 
hurt biodiversity, too. Humanity has driven many species to extinction.
Faced with a change in their environment (for example, warmer tempera-
tures), species often adapt by moving to a climate to which they’re better 
suited, but plants and animals that live on small islands, on mountain peaks, 
or along coastlines often don’t have this option. Species living in areas that 
have been fragmented by human developments — forests surrounded by 
subdivisions, for example — also can’t easily move.
Some species can’t move very far, no matter what. Slow and steady won’t win 
the race for survival if snails and turtles have to follow their ideal temperature 
ranges toward the Earth’s poles. Think about flightless birds and insects — 
they’re in for a very long walk on very small legs. And most plants stick to 
their roots (although some plants do manage to travel — see the sidebar “But 
plants can’t move!” in this chapter).

113
 Chapter 8: Risking Flora and Fauna: Impacts on Plants and Animals
Some plants and animals can live only in certain temperature ranges. For 
instance, Alpine meadows are very dependent on cool temperatures along 
the tops of mountain ranges. Coral reefs can bleach out and die because of a 
very small temperature change in the surrounding ocean. In Australia, some 
species of eucalyptus trees can survive no more than a 1.8 degree Fahrenheit 
(1 degree Celsius) temperature shift.
 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that an aver-
age increase in global warming of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) 
above 1850 levels — or 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) above 
today’s temperatures — will have serious effects on all the world’s major 
ecosystems, both on land and in water. (This shift in temperature is some-
times called the danger zone, which we discuss in more detail in Chapter 3.)
Ecosystems typically take from a few years to a few centuries to adapt to 
climate changes — which means that some ecosystems may not be able to 
cope in their current form. Even if alligators used to swim in the swamps of 
the current-day Arctic, never before have changes happened at such rapid 
rates and in combination with so many other pressures that human society 
has placed on ecosystems. The UN Convention for the Protection of Biological 
Diversity specifically states that “climate change is likely to become the 
dominant direct driver of biodiversity loss by the end of the century.”
Scientists don’t fully understand how ecosystems will be affected by continu-
ing climate change. Ecologists don’t know how organisms will respond to 
the stresses on their ecosystems. Climate change will affect each and every 
species in different ways. Some species may need to move, others may need 
to start eating different foods.
But plants can’t move!
We know, we know — we keep talking about 
plants and animals adapting by moving else-
where. But how does a plant or tree move? Of 
course, individual plants can’t travel, but the 
seeds that the plants spread can. Here’s how:
  Poop: Trees or plants that grow fruit or ber-
ries (think apple trees or raspberry bushes) 
are a food source for animals and people. 
When you eat a raspberry and swallow the 
seeds, well . . . what goes in one end must 
come out the other! Animals in the wild eat 
the fruit, wander while they digest, then 
do their business. The seeds in the poop 
decompose into the ground and grow a 
raspberry bush.
  Picked up, dropped down: Some fruits, 
such as plums and peaches, have big pits. 
Birds and animals take the fruit, eat it some-
where else, and discard the pit — which 
potentially may blossom into a new tree.
  Wind: Plants produce pollen and seeds 
that, after they develop, get carried away 
by the wind. Sometimes, they don’t go far, 
but they can! For example, a tree drops pine 
cones, and those pine cones can also be 
spread by the wind.

114
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
 
Healthy ecosystems can help humanity adapt to climate change and even 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As we discuss in Chapter 2, plants and 
healthy soils take in carbon dioxide. Plants create a lower temperature, and 
their root systems keep the soil healthy and able to absorb water, instead of 
letting it run off. The Convention on Biological Diversity reports that healthy 
and diverse ecosystems are more likely to adapt to climate change than are 
those that aren’t healthy or diverse.
Warming the World’s Waters: Threats 
to the Underwater World
Water makes up 70 percent of the Earth’s surface, making it a very impor-
tant set of ecosystems, including oceans, seas, wetlands, rivers, streams, 
and swamps. Climate change will affect all of these ecosystems in the form 
of increasing water temperatures, rising sea levels, or droughts brought on 
by rising air temperatures. (Refer to Chapter 7 for more about the natural 
disasters global warming may cause.) Exactly how these ecosystems will be 
affected, no one knows. Climate change is reshuffling the deck of water sys-
tems, and the world doesn’t know what kind of hand it’ll get dealt.
 
Many fish species are already at risk of extinction due to overfishing. 
According to scientists at Dalhousie University in Canada, fish populations 
have dropped more than 30 percent since the 1950s and are continuing to 
decrease. The projected loss from climate change will further elevate the risk 
of extinction.
 
Whether a few species are thriving or many species are declining in an eco-
system, these differences change the way the ecosystem functions. Each 
organism plays a role in an ecosystem. Ecosystems are remarkably adaptable; 
change the role of one organism, and the whole system alters in response. 
Global warming–related changes to ecosystems may cause some radical 
changes in their composition and how they function.
Under the sea
Ocean ecosystems are very complex. Climate change could change these 
ecosystems dramatically, proving disastrous for some species. The World 
Conservation Monitoring Centre highlights pressures brought on by global 
warming that they project will particularly affect ocean life:

115
 Chapter 8: Risking Flora and Fauna: Impacts on Plants and Animals
 
 Increasing carbon dioxide in the water: When the ocean water takes 
in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the carbon dioxide dissolves, 
becoming carbonic acid, which makes the water more acidic. Raising the 
water’s acidity negatively affects shell building for sea snails or coral, 
and when those species are endangered, so are all the species that prey 
on them or (in the case of reefs) live in and depend on them.
 
 Increasing water temperature: Many ocean species are sensitive to the 
temperature of the water. Coral reefs, for example, have been shown to 
suffer badly from higher water temperatures. The Great Barrier Reef off 
the coast of Australia is at risk.
 
 Shifting ocean movements: The ocean is constantly in motion, with a 
vast conveyer belt of currents that carry warmth to cooler parts of the 
globe (and vice versa). These currents provide food sources for other 
sea creatures. Increased fresh meltwater from polar ice, brought on by 
climate change, has the potential to shift, stall, or stop ocean currents 
altogether. (Refer to Chapter 7 for more information on the potential 
impact on ocean currents.) Currents influence the heat transfer in ocean 
environments, and changes in how warm water moves around can have 
consequences for temperature-sensitive species.
The impact of these changes will be different throughout the oceans of the 
world.
Drops in productivity
The IPCC expects icy ocean ecosystems in the Arctic and Antarctic to drop 
in productivity by 42 percent and 17 percent, respectively, by the year 2050. 
A productive ecosystem is one that’s conducive to life; while an ecosystem’s 
productivity drops, organisms within it decline. Much of this expected drop 
in productivity in the polar regions of the world relates to the expected 
decline in phytoplankton. Phytoplankton is a microscopic plant that’s called 
algae when it’s clumped together (but it isn’t the same thing as blue-green 
algae, which are bacteria), and it’s the primary food source for the entire 
ocean food web.
Phytoplankton in ice ecosystems forms along the edge of the sea ice. When 
sea ice shrinks, so does its edge, limiting the area that produces phytoplank-
ton. This reduction in phytoplankton will affect the fish and krill that feed on 
phytoplankton, their predators (penguins), and their predators (seals). See 
Figure 8-1 for a simplified version of the ocean food chain.
 
Research from the Institute of Science in Society notes that, without phyto-
plankton, “marine life will literally starve to death.”

Coral at risk
Coral reefs are already among the marine ecosystems at greatest risk of being 
destroyed by the effects of climate change. They’re the hub of diversity in the 
oceans. Coral might look like a rock or a rocky plant, but what you’re seeing 
is actually the outer skeleton of a living animal — yes, an animal — that 
has a stomach, a mouth, and even a sex life. Corals come in all shapes and 
sizes, twisting from left to right and in a rainbow of colors. They live all over 
the world, in both warm and cold waters, but they’re mostly concentrated 
around Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. The reefs support a wide array of 
small living water plants and fish. Without the reef, the plants and fish have 
no home. And without the plants and fish, the bigger fish in the sea have no 
food, and so on.
 
The IPCC reports that most, if not all, coral reefs will be bleached (meaning 
dead) if global average temperatures rise 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 degrees 
Celsius) above 1850 levels — or 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) 
above current levels. A sea surface temperature rise of 3.6 to 5.4 degrees 
Fahrenheit (2 to 3 degrees Celsius) above 1850 temperatures — or 0.4 to 4 
degrees Fahrenheit (0.2 to 2.2 degrees Celsius) above current levels — is the 
danger zone for coral, unless it can adapt. With a temperature rise of 
5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) above 1850 levels — or 4 degrees 
Fahrenheit (2.2 degrees Celsius) above today’s levels — all coral reef systems 
would die.
Despite the increasing evidence linking climate change to coral reef destruc-
tion, you can’t easily separate the effects of the climate from other major 
human pressures, such as pollution and fishing. The Caribbean, for example, 
has already lost 80 percent of its coral reefs because of other human pressures.
The IPCC predicts that areas covered by cold-water corals, such as those 
found off the east coast of Canada and the west coast of Norway, will go 
through a huge drop in productivity by the end of the century. Cold-water 
corals depend on nutrients that sink from the surface or arrive via ocean cur-
rents, so changes in ocean currents could be a threat to their survival.
Dramatic ecosystem changes
The IPCC expects a major change in the way marine ecosystems function 
worldwide. While some species decline and others migrate, the animals and 
plants in the sea will form new relationships. Predators may find themselves 
prey, other species may wind up competing with one another for the same 
food resources. No one knows how easy these transitions will be.

118
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
Lakes, rivers, wetlands, and bogs
The world’s freshwater will also see some serious changes brought on by 
global warming. Earlier spring runoff from snow and glacier melt, and less 
runoff in late summer, will affect rivers in many parts of the world. Compared 
to now, these rivers will be at higher levels in the spring and at lower levels 
in the late summer. And the lower summer levels mean less freshwater avail-
ability when it is most biologically needed. (Refer to Chapter 7 for more 
about melting glaciers.)
Wetlands and bogs are also at risk. These ecosystems depend on having enough 
water, and they don’t have much room for adaptation. When temperatures get 
warmer, more water evaporates from these areas. A dry bog or wetland is a bog 
or wetland no more.
Declining water quality
When water temperatures in lakes and rivers go up, the water quality 
declines. Here’s the process that leads to reduced water quality:
 
1. Warm waters are good homes for algae — tiny, green, plant-like organ-
isms that look like scum on water.
 
2. When the algae fall to the bottom of the waterbed and decompose, 
underwater sediment gives out phosphorus. Phosphorous is a poisonous 
chemical that looks like yellow wax and glows in the dark in natural 
environments. It’s also used for man-made products, such as the red bit 
on the tips of matches. Phosphorous can give a bad taste and odor to 
drinking water.
 
3. Algae thrive on phosphorous. Excess phosphorous means more algae.
 
4. Algae grow quickly, called an algal bloom. Bacteria and fungi decompose 
the algae and hog all the oxygen in the water because they breathe it 
in. The oxygen level in the water falls, meaning the water contains less 
oxygen for fish — which need oxygen to survive, just like we do.
Decreasing fish species
Scientists expect that warmer temperatures in lakes and rivers will have an 
adverse effect on fish species. Although some species may thrive — indeed, 
some fish species populations are actually increasing — others potentially 
face extinction. Different species have different ranges of temperatures in 
which they’re comfortable. Species that have large comfortable temperature 
ranges can adapt more easily than more sensitive species because they’re 
not affected by these temperature shifts.

119
 Chapter 8: Risking Flora and Fauna: Impacts on Plants and Animals
As the saying goes, you win some, you lose some. Unfortunately, climate 
change means the Earth will lose a lot. For example, the IPCC predicts that 
if global temperatures rise 2.3 to 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.3 to 1.7 degrees 
Celsius) above 1850 levels — or 0.9 to 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit (0.5 to 0.9 
degrees Celsius) above current levels — then North America will lose 8 to 16 
percent of its freshwater fish habitat. This loss of habitat translates to a 9- to 
18-percent loss of salmon.
Risking Our Forests
 
At least at first, warming temperatures are expected to be good for plants and 
trees. Already, the IPCC reports, forests have been more productive over the 
last few years than in previous decades. The growing seasons are becoming 
longer, and the air contains more carbon dioxide for the plants and trees to 
take in.
In time, however, rises in temperatures and changes in ecosystems will have 
an overall negative effect on forests because of larger, more frequent fires; 
regular disease outbreaks; and insect infestations.
Tropical
Rainforests, which are most commonly found in the tropics, can survive only 
within small temperature ranges. As their name suggests, rainforests depend 
on rain. The combination of warming temperatures and changing rainfall pat-
terns brought on by global warming could adversely affect the rainforests. 
In that situation, the IPCC predicts that species in tropical mountain forests 
face a high risk of extinction. IPCC reports show that the Amazon region 
could lose a lot of its forest and biodiversity if global average temperatures 
reach 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit (2.5 degrees Celsius) above 1850 levels — or 
3.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 degrees Celsius) above current levels. In fact, if 
the concentrations of carbon dioxide were to grow by 50 percent, the scien-
tists at the Meteorological Office Hadley Centre in the U.K. say the Amazon 
rainforest could disappear.
 
Luckily, temperature changes won’t fluctuate much in regions around the 
equator in comparison to northern regions, which we talk about in the follow-
ing section. How much these tropical areas will warm is uncertain.

120
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
Boreal
Boreal forests are named for the aurora borealis; these vast coniferous for-
ests ring the northern region of the globe, from Scandinavia (where it’s called 
taiga) to Russia, Alaska, and much of Canada. Boreal forests are found in 
northern and high Alpine regions — think pine, spruce, and fir trees.
Boreal forests will undergo many small-scale shifts while the climate changes:
 
 Changes in the numbers of species living in the forest
 
 Faster maturation and shorter life spans for trees
 
 Shifting relationships within the ecosystem
Rainfall patterns are also expected to change, and in many cases decrease, 
bringing more droughts. Taken together, these changes will add up to a 
major transformation in temperate forests.
Because high latitudes are experiencing great temperature changes, these 
boreal forests have a greater need for adaptation than tropical forests.
More forest fires
Boreal forests are naturally a fire-driven ecosystem — fires are a normal, 
dynamic part of the way the ecosystem currently functions. Fires clear out 
older trees and enable saplings to flourish. Such fires haven’t been a regu-
lar occurrence, however, and they haven’t spread like . . . well, wildfire. But 
already increased numbers of fires are affecting larger areas of forest thanks 
to dryer conditions brought on by human-triggered climate change.
Increased pests
Forest pests have already increased. Usually, colder temperatures keep 
insect populations down — most don’t survive the cold winter months. With 
warming temperatures, however, more insects are making it through the 
winter. Also, certain kinds of beetles attack old or weak trees — and forests 
in British Columbia, Canada, are filled with old lodgepole pine. Warming tem-
peratures combined with the age structure of the trees have led to the pine 
beetle populations exploding.
 
Mountain pine beetles in interior British Columbia have killed an area of forest 
as large as two Swedens. Millions of trees have been killed — trees that are the 
core of the province’s logging economy. The lodgepole pine stands, habitat to 
mountain caribou and an important economic mainstay, may soon be a thing 

121
 Chapter 8: Risking Flora and Fauna: Impacts on Plants and Animals
of the past. The large stands of dry, dead trees left behind are much more sus-
ceptible to forest fires. The provincial government in British Columbia expects 
this high population of pine beetles to continue until an early cold snap 
occurs, which could kill beetle larvae before they’re old enough to survive 
winter. A similar phenomenon is happening in Norway with the spruce bark 
beetle.
Preparing for Mass Extinctions
When the forces acting on an ecosystem change dramatically, many of the 
species that live in that ecosystem are at risk.
Although scientists aren’t certain how ecosystems will adapt to global 
warming, and even though each species and region will react differently, the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that 18 to 24 
percent of plant and animal species will go extinct if the Earth experiences 
an average global temperature rise of 2.9 to 4.1 degrees Fahrenheit (1.6 to 
2.3 degrees Celsius) above 1850 levels — or 1.4 to 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit 
(0.8 to 1.4 degrees Celsius) above current levels. This extinction estimate 
keeps increasing while the temperature does, rising to 35 percent extinction 
with average global temperatures rising 2.9 degrees Fahrenheit (1.6 degrees 
Celsius) above 1850 levels — or 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) 
above current levels.
 
Extinctions are irreversible. When those creatures are gone, they’re gone!
Overall, species that migrate are expected to be the most vulnerable because 
their livelihood depends on the climate of the seasons. Migratory species 
include birds that fly south for the winter and large mammals, such as cari-
bou, that migrate to find food. These animals are at risk because the season 
in which their food is available may shift more quickly than they can adapt. 
Species may miss feeding seasons all together. The seasons in the regions 
between which they migrate may no longer align. For example, red-wing 
blackbirds might arrive back in their northern homes to find that the marshy 
areas where they traditionally nest in spring have dried up. The Arctic 
Climate Impact Assessment by the Arctic Council expects that migratory 
birds will lose half of their breeding area sometime within this century.
Food sources might increase for some animals because of warmer growing 
temperatures, but other species, such as many kinds of birds, will suffer, 
when the area of their habitat declines. See Figure 8-2 for different effects that 
the temperature change will have on wildlife.

Life’s no beach: Endangered 
tropical species
Plants and animals in tropical mountain regions are vulnerable to water 
stress, meaning that they either have too much or too little water. Reports 
from around the world show that warming temperatures affect a number of 
species in a variety of ways:
 
 Small mammals: Animals that have small populations (and thus a small 
gene pool) or small habitat ranges are at risk — a handful of these are in 
Australia, such as possums, bandicoots, and wallaroos.
 
 Water birds: More frequent instances of drought and lowered water 
tables put birds such as the Baikal teal in Asia at risk because they 
depend on water areas, such as marshes, to nest and breed.
 
 Amphibians and reptiles: The likes of frogs and lizards could face 
extinction with the amount of warming that has already happened. 
Disease outbreaks are occurring because climates are becoming more 
favorable for those diseases.
Species living in deserts (yes, things can live in the desert!) are at risk 
because they have to move farther to find a new suitable climate. Areas at 
high elevations differ greatly from land at sea level in humidity, precipitation, 
and temperature because of the difference in altitude, so species don’t have 
to look far for a new home. Deserts are flat, however, and pretty much the 
same across the entire region. For example, 2,800 of the plant species in the 

123
 Chapter 8: Risking Flora and Fauna: Impacts on Plants and Animals
Succulent Karoo desert of South Africa will be extinct if temperatures rise 2.7 to 
4.9 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 2.7 degrees Celsius) above 1850 temperatures — 
or 1.3 to 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.7 to 1.9 degrees Celsius) above today’s tem-
peratures — because they won’t be able to move far and fast enough to find a 
livable climate. For the same reason, the Jico deer mice and pocket gophers that 
live in Mexican deserts likely won’t be able to adapt to climate change.
Thin ice: Polar bears and 
other polar animals
Species in polar regions are the most vulnerable in the world to climate 
change. Warmer temperatures at the north and south poles will decrease ice 
cover, increase the temperatures of the water, reduce snow cover, and thaw 
what used to be permanently frozen ground. The rate of climate change may 
be too fast for plants to move toward the poles. These changes will put many 
polar species at risk of extinction, including polar bears, seals, and various 
birds.
Changes in the Arctic
Because the polar bear is the first large mammal that’s facing extinction from 
global warming, it’s the iconic image for climate change. Scientists estimate 
that 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears are left in the world. Polar bears feed on 
seals, which spend a lot of their time on the ice. Less ice coverage means 
fewer hunting opportunities for polar bears. Their lives are entirely depen-
dent on the sea ice.
The melting ice is also bad news for the seals, even if it does reduce their 
chances of being claimed by a polar bear. All Arctic seals that depend on the 
ice for resting, breeding, and giving birth — including the bearded, ribbon, 
and ringed seals — are being put at risk by the ice melt.
In northern Canada, several species will be affected by the shrinking Arctic 
tundra, which is expected to shrink to a third of its original land cover while 
temperatures continue to warm. Because they’ll be losing their primary 
source of food — species such as tundra plants — caribou and muskoxen are 
at risk. The Arctic tundra is also a breeding ground for geese, shorebirds, and 
the Siberian Crane. When the tundra shrinks, so does the area available for 
breeding, reducing the chance of breeding, as well.
Extinction in Antarctica
Heading down south to the Antarctic continent — known as the last great 
wilderness, where humans have seldom been — many species are already 
at risk:

124
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
 
 Crabeater seals don’t depend on crabs to survive — despite the name. 
They depend on the ice, just like Arctic seals, for resting, breeding, and 
giving birth. As ice conditions in the Antarctic change, these seals are 
affected, too.
 
 Emperor penguins, the movie stars of March of the Penguins and Happy 
Feet, eat krill as part of their daily diet. With warmer waters and fewer 
krill, Emperor penguins have a smaller food source. Warming tempera-
tures make for better breeding because fewer chicks die from extreme 
cold, but this benefit will be small compared to the loss of krill as a food 
source, meaning more penguins with less food.
Zoë was lucky enough to stand among thousands of Adélie penguins and 
their hatching chicks on an Antarctic expedition in 2007. Wildlife special-
ists on her expedition explained that precipitation is increasing over many 
parts of the Western Peninsula, where Adélie penguins thrive. So, the 
peninsula experiences more snow cover more often, even if it melts fairly 
quickly. These penguins need snow-free surfaces for hatching chicks, so this 
increased snowfall is a problem for them. Adélies could become extinct in 
some areas of Antarctica over the next 7 to 30 years.
Starting things off at the right temperatures
Climate change will benefit some species in 
the short term. Regions suffering from drought 
may have more frequent rainfall, and plants that 
used to be stunted in growth by chilly tempera-
tures may now grow faster while temperatures 
warm. Here are a few of the short-term benefits 
species will see, thanks to global warming:
  Fewer deaths from exposure to extreme 
cold in northern countries. (This benefit will 
be offset by the increase in deaths from 
exposure to extreme heat in other areas, 
however.)
  Higher crop yields in northern latitude 
regions and greater forest growth in north-
ern Europe. (This benefit will eventually be 
outweighed by negative impacts of the heat 
on plant health.)
  Warmer waters or land temperatures will 
allow some species to thrive because the 
greenhouse effect initially causes plants 
(food sources for many) to be more produc-
tive, absorbing more carbon.
The long-term benefits are highly uncertain. The 
IPCC estimates that costs and benefits will be 
roughly equal if the Earth sticks to a global tem-
perature increase of less than 3.1 to 6.7 degrees 
Fahrenheit (1.7 to 3.7 degrees Celsius) above 1850 
levels — or less than 1.6 to 5.2 degrees Fahrenheit 
(0.9 to 2.9 degrees Celsius) above today’s levels. If 
the world goes 4.9 to 6.7 degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 
to 3.7 degrees Celsius) above 1850 levels — 3.4 to 
5.2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.9 to 2.9 degrees Celsius) 
above current levels — then the balance tips — 
meaning increasingly more costs and fewer ben-
efits to species.

Direct Effect on People

S
o far, global warming hasn’t had a huge impact on most people’s lives. 
The first human victims of climate change are the Inuit of the Arctic, 
whose traditional world is increasingly unstable because of melting perma-
frost and disappearing ice; the residents of low-lying islands, some of whom 
have already been forced to move because the rising sea engulfed their 
homes; and those hit hardest by increasingly violent weather events. These 
people are trying very hard to get the attention of the rest of humanity. But 
the vast majority of humans continue their day-to-day lives, oblivious to the 
threat.
The impact of global warming will increase in the coming years, but the 
degree of change will vary greatly, depending on where you live and depend-
ing on how rapidly nations around the world reduce greenhouse emissions. 
In some areas, farms and crops will benefit, but in others they will suffer. If 
you live in a northern country, warm weather might be a blessing, but higher 
temperatures could be a strain if you live in a southern country and have no 
access to air conditioning. No matter where you live, the unchecked impacts 
of climate change are potentially catastrophic in the long-term.
Wealth is another factor that will determine the impact that global warming 
has on people. For those with the resources to shield themselves, climate 
change will be only a costly inconvenience, at first. People without those 
resources won’t be so lucky. But those with money will be able to pay their 

126
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
way out of problems at first — whether it means building new infrastructures 
to protect people from natural disasters or paying for importing water in the 
instance of drought. Unless humanity acts fast, both the rich and the poor 
will suffer eventually. Everyone is in the same boat.
In this chapter, we look at how changes in climate can affect your health, 
food, and city. We also consider how some people — such as northern indig-
enous communities and women around the world — will be particularly 
adversely affected by global warming.
Like all the information in this part, this chapter may get you down. But 
remember, these projections merely suggest what might happen if civiliza-
tion stays its current course. People can stop the impact of global warming 
from becoming devastating — and some effects can be avoided entirely — 
but more people must start cutting our carbon emissions right now. Check 
out Parts IV and V for more about how civilization can avoid the worst case 
scenarios that we discuss in this chapter.
Health Scare: Outbreaks and Diseases
Few scientific studies have been conducted to examine the impact global 
warming alone will have on people’s health. From examining what little 
information they have, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) states that climate change is adding to the number of people suffering 
from disease or early death. The World Health Organization estimates that 
climate change was already responsible for 150,000 individual deaths around 
the world in the year 2000. Because global warming’s effects have worsened 
since that time, that number has probably risen.
Climate change will affect health issues in both positive and negative ways. 
The bad impacts on health will, unfortunately, greatly outweigh the good. 
Figure 9-1 gives an idea of the intensity of these impacts, weighting the 
negative impacts against the positive. Very high confidence translates into a 
minimum 95 percent certainty; high confidence is 60 to 95 percent certainty, 
while medium confidence is 40 to 60 percent certainty.
Malaria
The link between malaria (a disease carried by mosquitoes and causing 
chills and fever that can lead to death) and climate change is unclear. About 
five years ago, scientists argued that climate change could cause malaria to 
spread. Now, however, scientists believe that occurrences of malaria will 

127
 Chapter 9: Hitting Home: Global Warming’s Direct Effect on People
vary by region depending on the climate changes of the region. For example, 
malaria transmission will likely decrease in southeastern Africa in the next 12 
years, but the risk of malaria will increase in industrialized countries includ-
ing Australia and the UK.
 
Two climate conditions can make a region a mosquito hotbed: high rainfall 
and warm temperatures. Still water and warm weather make for a perfect 
romantic getaway for mosquitoes. Rainfall can leave puddles and pools of 
water, still and ready for action. Warm temperatures allow mosquitoes to sur-
vive. Regions with this type of climate, or that will be experiencing this type of 
climate in the near future, may be more susceptible to malaria if mosquitoes 
in that region are affected.
Many other factors contribute to malaria transmission, such as the national 
health infrastructure and education, so definitively identifying climate 
change as a cause of the disease’s spread is almost impossible. For example, 
although malaria has returned to the highlands of Kenya, scientists don’t 
know why it has. Some say it’s because of warming temperatures, but it could 
just as well be that the disease has developed a resistance to anti-malarial 
drugs or because of some other environmental changes.

Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
Scientists do know, however, that the range of malaria-borne mosquitoes has 
the potential to shift because of increased climate changes around the world. 
Those mosquitoes may leave some areas and move into others.
Cholera
Global warming doesn’t directly cause cholera, an infectious disease that 
causes major cramps and diarrhea, but its effects may create an environ-
ment in which the disease can flourish. Cholera isn’t fatal if treated promptly, 
but it can be very dangerous in parts of the world with shaky public health 
systems.
Cholera usually happens in areas with bad or non-existent sewer systems, 
where human excrement ends up mingling with drinking water. Flooding 
brought on by climate change might lead to a cholera outbreak in those 
regions because flood waters can wash human and animal waste into sources 
of drinking water. South Asia, for example, could have an increased risk to 
and toxicity of cholera if local ocean water temperatures rise, reports the 
IPCC. (Refer to Chapter 7 for more about the risks of flooding.)
Other problems worsened 
by global warming
The IPCC points out a number of health concerns that civilization already 
deals with that might worsen because of climate changes and extreme 
weather events:
 
 Allergies: If you have allergies to pollen and dust, those allergies could 
get worse, depending on where you live. If global warming brings you 
an early spring, that early spring will bring pollen, too — extending your 
allergy season. Countries such as Canada, Finland, and the Netherlands 
will probably be most affected by the increase in pollen because they’re 
undergoing larger seasonal changes than more southern countries.
 
 Contaminated drinking water: This could be a risk for areas that see 
an increase in rainfall and flooding because of global warming. During 
Hurricane Katrina in the U.S., for example, water supplies became con-
taminated, and many cases of diarrheal diseases appeared, some of 
which were fatal. (We talk about flooding and water contamination in 
detail in Chapter 7.)
 
 Dengue fever: Found in warm climates, this disease causes severe joint 
pain. Like malaria, it’s carried by mosquitoes. A pool of still water is a 
mosquito’s honeymoon suite. Consequently, a lot of rain (creating more 
pools of water where mosquitoes breed) combined with temperatures 

129
 Chapter 9: Hitting Home: Global Warming’s Direct Effect on People
warm enough for the mosquito to survive can increase its spread — but 
oddly, so can drought. When drought hits an area, more people store 
water outdoors, creating other excellent mosquito-breeding sites. The 
IPCC expects that global warming will create climates in both New 
Zealand and Australia that are favorable for mosquitoes and for dengue, 
and that both countries will see more species of mosquitoes that can 
carry the virus.
 
 One report shows that about a third of the world already has favorable 
conditions for dengue and that 5 to 6 billion people will be at risk of 
dengue by 2085, compared to the 3.5 billion that would be at risk with-
out climate change as a factor.
 
 Diarrheal disease: Think extreme diarrhea. This disease occurs most 
frequently in Australia, Peru, Israel, and islands in the Pacific Ocean 
when the temperatures soar and rainfall patterns change. Bacteria 
thrive in higher temperatures, and flooding increases the risk of infect-
ing drinking water sources. Areas that have poor sanitation have even 
greater risk.
 
 Lung problems: Air pollution often worsens health issues, such as 
asthma. Smog episodes, for example, are more intense during heat 
waves — so, you find more lung problems in big cities than anywhere 
else. Many greenhouse gases — methane and nitrous oxide to name 
two — just happen to also pollute the air. The women and children in 
some developing countries have a higher prevalence of lung cancer 
because of the smoke from fires that they burn to cook their meals — 
whereas the men aren’t as affected since they are out of the house for 
most of the day.
 
 Lyme disease: Carried by ticks that hang out in trees and burrow into 
your skin (yuck), Lyme disease can cause everything from joint swell-
ing, fever, and a rash to significant disability. For example, Lyme disease 
has moved north in Sweden because of milder winters and is becoming 
more common in Portugal and the Netherlands. It has spread in North 
America, as well.
 
 Skin cancer: Too much direct sun exposure can cause this form of 
cancer. In areas that experience rising temperatures, people often want 
to be outside in the sun more and wear less clothing. To add to the 
problem, greenhouse gases (GHGs) actually cool the upper layers of the 
atmosphere, which creates perfect conditions for ozone-depleting gases 
that create holes in the ozone layer. And that means less protection 
from the sun. An increased risk of skin cancer is particularly worrying 
in places with depleted ozone, such as Australia, where people already 
have a high risk to dangerous sun exposure.
 
 Vermin: Rats, mice, and other rodents often carry disease. Flooding or 
heavy rain pushes these little critters out of their burrows and directly 
into the paths of humans. Low-income countries that are susceptible to 
flooding, such as many within Central America, are particularly at risk.

130
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
Putting Pressure on the Fields
Because agriculture depends on the land and the climate for its products, it’ll 
feel the impact of global warming more than any other industry, which could 
cause increased inconsistency and uncertainty for the world’s food supply. 
The temperature changes, severe storms and rains, and altering growing sea-
sons that we discuss in Chapter 7 will affect farmers worldwide while climate 
change develops. But those changes won’t affect all farmers in the same way.
Affecting farmers
Agricultural productivity could increase or decrease, depending on the 
region. Northern Europe, for example, should have better growing seasons, 
but areas around the Mediterranean probably won’t do as well.
 
Currently, more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and longer growing seasons 
are helping some crops grow. Northern Hemisphere regions, such as southern 
Canada, are already seeing benefits from warmer temperatures — a 1.8 to 5.4 
degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 3 degree Celsius) boost in local temperatures above 
1850 levels, or 0.4 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.2 to 2.2 degrees Celsius) above 
current temperatures, means a boost in crop yields in these places. Plus, farm-
ers can plant many crops sooner when the seasons shift. The International 
Food Policy Research Institute expects a 56-percent increase in world cereal 
crops and a 90-percent jump in livestock between 1997 and 2050 in regions 
such as the U.S. and Canada, where an adequate water supply exists. Crop 
increase beyond 2050, however, is not likely.
On the other hand, regions such as southern Africa will suffer from an 
increasingly warm and dry climate. There, rainfall isn’t only becoming less 
frequent, but also less predictable. These conditions together are actually 
reducing the length of the planting season in southern Africa, the opposite 
of what’s happening in the Northern Hemisphere. Tropical regions will likely 
produce far less food from crops, especially rice.
 
In the long-term, the IPCC expects that the overall effects would be negative 
around the world. If people allow temperatures to continue to increase, they 
could exceed what many crops can stand, and those crops won’t survive. 
Some crops in dryer or lower-latitude regions suffer from even a small tem-
perature rise. For example, mango and cotton crops in Peru have a shorter 
growing season when temperatures are higher than normal. Temperature 
aside, extreme weather events, such as heavy rains or droughts, can stress 
crops by either drowning or dehydrating them, enough to upset any farmer 
depending on selling those crops. Pest outbreaks can damage crops, and pest 

131
 Chapter 9: Hitting Home: Global Warming’s Direct Effect on People
outbreaks become more frequent when the climate becomes more favorable 
to them. These outbreaks are not easy to project because all pests are differ-
ent and climates differ regionally. To prepare for these possibilities, agrono-
mists (scientists focused on crops and soil) are trying to develop crops that 
are more pest- and drought-resistant.
Hurting the global food supply
First, the good news: The IPCC predicts that the number of undernourished 
people in the world will decrease dramatically in the next few decades, 
thanks to quickly developing countries and their growing economies.
Now, the bad news: If people don’t fight global warming, progress will be 
stalled and that decrease will occur at a much slower rate. About 820 million 
people in the world are undernourished. By 2080, the number of malnour-
ished people could decline at least to 230 million — not quite making poverty 
history, but definitely making an improvement. With climate change, civili-
zation could make less progress, ending up with 380 million malnourished 
people instead.
If global warming increases unchecked, the number of hungry could be 
almost 40-percent higher than if humanity addresses climate change. And 
some estimates in IPCC reports say that it could take 35 more years to cut 
world hunger in half if civilization doesn’t act on climate change; addressing 
climate change could see the number of undernourished people in the world 
halved by 2015, but that goal won’t be reached until 2050 if emissions con-
tinue to grow and temperatures continue to rise.
The IPCC reports that world food production will likely grow when local tem-
peratures rise 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 3 degrees Celsius) above 
1850 levels — or 0.4 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.2 to 2.2 degrees Celsius) 
above current temperatures — but these numbers don’t apply everywhere 
equally. In both dry and tropical southern regions of the globe, the IPCC 
expects crop production to drop when just a 1.8- to 3.6-degree Fahrenheit 
(1- to 2-degree Celsius) local temperature shift occurs. This drop in crop 
production will then directly increase that region’s risk of hunger. And 
globally, with any increase above 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius), 
major crops of corn and wheat will be below normal in low latitude countries, 
such as Brazil and Kenya, whether farmers try to adapt or not. This amount 
of warming will also stress and even kill livestock in semi-arid areas such as 
inland eastern Australia or dryer regions of Texas. For agriculture in northern 
countries, such as Canada, the IPCC reports that temperatures are rising 
more than the world average — the Arctic, for example, has warmed almost 
twice as fast as the rest of the world over the last century.

132
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
Paying the Price for Global Warming
Debate over global warming really heats up when it comes to money. 
Because industry contributes a lot of the excess greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere, some governments, such as the United States under President 
George W. Bush, worry that cutting greenhouse gases would have an adverse 
effect on the economy.
To be honest, reducing greenhouse gas emissions will have a financial 
impact. In 2006, Sir Nicholas Stern, former Senior Economist to the World 
Bank, reviewed the economic impacts of the climate crisis at the request 
of the U.K. government. His report, “The Stern Review on the Economics of 
Climate Change,” looked at the financial impact that global warming would 
have on the world’s economy. In his most recent report, “Key Elements of 
a Global Deal on Climate Change,” he calculated that acting now to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions would cost the world a cut of 2 percent of global 
gross domestic product (also known as GDP, the global measuring stick of 
economic wealth) annually over the next several decades. India already 
spends 2 percent of its GDP on adapting to climate change impacts.
Stern’s report also examined the cost to the world if people did nothing and 
greenhouse gas emissions weren’t reduced. If humanity doesn’t reduce green-
house gas emissions now, the report found it will cost Earth’s population five 
times more than if it does, resulting in a cut of 5 percent of the GDP — every 
year. And that’s one of the better-case scenarios. The worst-case scenarios 
show that waiting to reduce emissions could cost the world 20 percent of 
global GDP or more. Failing to reduce greenhouse gases could cost the world 
economy $7 trillion!
Warmer weather: A gift to wine drinkers?
Recent research has shown that warming 
weather has boosted wine production. Just 
as vineyards and wineries thrived during the 
medieval warm period, the IPCC reports that the 
climate in northern Europe and in parts of the 
United States, such as California and Oregon, 
is much more favorable for growing grapes 
than it was previously. Before you get your 
hopes up, remember that climate change also 
means more extreme and varied weather, not 
just a nice warming touch. In the spring of 2006, 
Californians woke up to icicles hanging from 
their fruit trees. And Canadian ice wines, which 
are made from grapes that they first freeze 
on the vine, have been suffering from warmer 
temperatures.

133
 Chapter 9: Hitting Home: Global Warming’s Direct Effect on People
 
Despite the projections in the Stern report, the GDP has continued to grow an 
average of 34 percent in industrialized countries, even as those countries cut 
greenhouse gas emissions (by 3.3 percent between 1990 and 2004, for exam-
ple). Germany cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17.2 percent while watching 
its GDP rise 28.6 percent in that time frame.
 
Many European countries have benefited with continued GDP growth because 
they started acting on climate change decades ago. The Stern reports give a 
clear message: The longer humanity waits to act on climate change, the more 
serious the impacts become, and the more it costs humanity to adapt and 
recover.
Highways, waterworks, and the 
other stuff humans build
In Chapter 8, we talk about natural systems at risk because of climate change, 
but human-built systems are at risk, too. Governments call it infrastructure — 
such as the roads that you drive on and the waterworks that take away sewage 
and deliver potable (suitable for drinking) water. It’s the stuff that humans have 
built to make modern life easier. And civilization built all of this stuff for the 
climate it used to have.
No matter where you are in the world, the costs from extreme weather — 
major flooding, fires, landslides, and storms — have been increasing for the 
last three decades. These natural catastrophes, brought on by civilization’s 
unnatural addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, endanger the 
infrastructure that’s the backbone of our cities. The repair bill for the follow-
ing damages won’t be cheap:
 
 Buildings: Storms and flooding can quickly damage unstable buildings. 
People living in inadequate housing that is easily damaged by strong 
winds or storms are especially at risk from the extreme effects of climate 
change.
 
 Electricity demand: Hotter days mean cooler buildings when people run 
their air conditioners to the max. Heat waves come hand in hand with 
skyrocketing electricity demand and, often, major blackouts.
 
 Sewage systems: Storms and flooding can also cause the sewage sys-
tems in cities to overflow.
 
 Transmission lines: You’ve likely seen downed telephone poles and 
power lines after a big storm. Damaged transmission lines could become 
a more common sight for many parts of the world.
 
 Transportation: Highways, roads, and railroad lines will all require more 
frequent maintenance and repair when they’re subjected to extreme 
weather.

134
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
Although everyone will be affected by the physical impacts of climate change, 
some people will be more vulnerable to negative changes. The poor are par-
ticularly at risk. Poverty, combined with a lack of social support, was the main 
cause of heat wave deaths in the Chicago heat wave of 1995. People in coastal 
cities — accounting for 10 to 23 percent of the world’s population — are 
vulnerable to sea level rise and flooding from storm surges because of their 
proximity to the ocean. Cities that don’t have much green space will be at 
greater risk, too; without soil and trees that stabilize the ground and absorb 
water, these concrete cities are more vulnerable to landslides and flooding.
An unfair split: Costs to the industrialized 
and developing nations
Industrialized countries, such as the U.S. and the U.K., have pumped most 
of the excess greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere — through 
industry; their heavy reliance on cars; and their ever-growing, ravenous 
consumption of electricity and energy. Developing countries don’t have the 
amenities that create greenhouse gas emissions. The effects of global warm-
ing don’t care who’s to blame, however. Because developing countries have 
fewer resources and less financial ability to recover from natural disasters, 
they will feel the first major impacts of climate change.
Developing countries don’t have the economic resources to adapt to climate 
change and to recover from its worst effects. The U.S. is still cleaning up the 
damage caused in New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with a final bill 
that some say might be as much as $150 billion. Katrina happened to one 
of the wealthiest nations on Earth. Imagine the impact for a nation such as 
Honduras or Guatemala if Katrina had made landfall there. The IPCC reports 
that in 1985 and 1999, for example, natural disasters lost about 2.5 percent 
of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the world’s richest nations, and the 
poorest nations suffered a loss of 13.4 percent of their combined GDP.
The financial costs that come along with extreme weather events — storms, 
flooding, and droughts — give any country a huge economic hit. Because 
they lack the industrialized countries’ strong, diversified economies, devel-
oping nations have far fewer economic resources to bounce back from such 
a huge disaster — yet they’re the most likely to be hit, and hit first, because 
of their geographical locations. Ninety percent of deaths caused by natural 
disasters happen in developing countries. You’ve likely seen stories in the 
news about these natural-disaster deaths, such as the 30,000 people killed 
from flash floods and landslides in Caracas in 1999, or the 15,000 homes dam-
aged by major flooding in Cape Town in 2001. Though climatologists can’t 

135
 Chapter 9: Hitting Home: Global Warming’s Direct Effect on People
link these events directly to climate change, the trend is consistent with 
climatic events. They also demonstrate that developing regions are more vul-
nerable to extreme weather than industrialized areas.
 
Developing nations need to move quickly to adapt — with measures rang-
ing from regulating freshwater use to building levies to planting forests — to 
cushion the inevitable impacts of climate change. (We discuss how developing 
nations can adapt to global warming in Chapter 12.) The money that those 
countries are spending on adaptation was originally earmarked for further 
development. Consequently, development is slowing while adaptation mea-
sures are growing. The Stern Review Report on the Economics of Climate 
Change expects adaptation to cost tens of billions of dollars annually, just for 
developing countries.
 
While countries around the world begin to apply solutions to climate change, 
developing countries will probably get partners to support their adaptation 
measures. Carbon markets and country-to-country partnerships within the 
Kyoto Protocol (such as the Clean Development Mechanism) are two major 
tools that can help alleviate pressures on developing nations. We talk about 
these solution-based projects in Chapter 12.
Feeling the Heat First: Unequal Effects
Just as climate change affects regions differently, it affects groups of people 
differently as well. Unfortunately, the impact of climate change will be most 
keenly felt by those who have few resources to adapt. Activists who seek 
to address the imbalance of who’s causing climate change and who’s being 
affected by it refer to their cause as climate justice. In this section, we look at 
some of the major climate injustices various populations around the world 
are experiencing — and will experience.
Heavy warnings: Beyond the IPCC
Not too many years ago, the U.S. Department of 
Defense (a surprising source) studied the risks 
of climate change to global security. The report, 
titled “An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario 
and Its Implications for United States National 
Security,” was covered in Fortune magazine in 
2004. The Pentagon study concluded that the 
risks of climate change were more significant 
than the risks of terrorism.

136
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
Northern communities
The north is seeing some of the strongest changes brought on by global warm-
ing, and these changes are threatening the way of life for many communities.
Indigenous communities are particularly affected. The permafrost and thick 
winter ice that served as their road surfaces are melting. Traditional food 
sources are becoming hard to obtain; the melting ice makes fishing and hunt-
ing difficult. Thin ice has caused several hunting accidents.
Climate change is making the weather less predictable than ever before. 
Many people think about the weather only when they’re going somewhere or 
heading outside for leisure or recreation. But in these indigenous communi-
ties, weather helps define their way of life.
Some northern communities think they can fully adapt to all the changes. 
Others are considering moving to new locations where they can live more 
easily, and still others are enjoying longer hunting seasons. But all these 
communities are experiencing noticeable change, and it’s not slowing down 
any time soon.
Changing culture and lives
The Inuit have been adapting to these changes, but at the cost of their tradi-
tional culture. The Inuit are a hunting people, but they now have shorter and 
shorter hunting seasons because the ice melts earlier and earlier each year. 
Uphill battle for downhill skiing
You know something’s a big deal when it needs 
an international conference. The year 2003 
saw the very first International Conference on 
Climate Change and Tourism.
Ski hills around the world have been closing in 
recent years because of rising temperatures 
and too little snowfall. The ski hills that are still 
operating face shortened ski seasons and make 
do with machines that make snow.
Ice skating, outdoor hockey, downhill and 
cross-country skiing, snowboarding, the luge, 
sledding, snowshoeing, and extreme sports 
such as ice climbing are all at risk.
Climate change won’t hurt just cold weather 
tourism — islands that lure people to the 
beaches each winter need to be thinking about 
rising sea levels and storm surges, and how 
those changes will affect their infrastructure. 
Coral-reef tourism could change or even cease, 
and the tourist season in certain countries 
could shift.

137
 Chapter 9: Hitting Home: Global Warming’s Direct Effect on People
While their environment changes so rapidly, knowledge that was passed 
down for generations becomes unreliable. In an interview with the Nunatsiaq 
News, Naalak Nappalak, an elder from Kangiqsujuaq, described how he can 
no longer confidently predict the weather: “Before we knew by looking at 
the sky whether there would be storms or if it would be calm. Nowadays just 
when you think you know how the weather will be, they can change in an 
instant. It’s this inconsistency that is most noticeable.”
People living outside of the native village of Kotzebue in northwestern Alaska 
can travel into the town for supplies only when the ice is sufficiently frozen 
and stable for travel. Warming temperatures mean a longer thawed season, 
which means people who need supplies or medical attention have longer to 
wait. The ice also usually serves as a barrier to storm surges, and less freeze-
up over the year can lead to erosion and flooding along beachside roads.
People living in the indigenous community of Lovozero in Russia have had 
to deal with climate change in a number of ways. As one local described it, 
“Bogs and marshes do not freeze immediately, rhythms change, and we have 
to change our routes of movement, and this means a whole new system of 
living is under change. Everything has become more difficult.”
Affecting the hunt
Some northerners can hunt more easily because of climate change, however, 
including those who fish for larger whitefish, as well as clamming harvesters 
and seal hunters (because shorter periods of sea ice give longer water-based 
hunting periods). Access to wood for fire fuel has improved, too, because it 
washes up on shore for a longer period of time each year.
 
Although northerners may hunt more easily in the short-term, climate change 
threatens the survival of many species (as we talk about in Chapter 8). Animal 
populations, such as the seals that depend on sea ice, can become easily 
stressed by global warming, which translates into stress put on humans in the 
long-run.
In Qaanaaq, Greenland, people describe that just seven or eight years ago, 
they used to be able to go out onto the ice to hunt as early as October. 
Now, these hunting grounds sometimes don’t freeze up until January. 
Temperature, coupled with changing sea currents and wind conditions, 
causes these changes. The places in this area of Greenland are named for 
their natural and geographic characteristics. Ironically, some of these places 
no longer fit their names — Sermiarsussuaq, which means “the smaller large 
glacier,” used to cover the landscape all the way to the ocean’s edge. It no 
longer exists.

138
Part III: Examining the Effects of Global Warming 
People in poverty
Poorer populations in developing and industrialized countries are very 
vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Poor people don’t have the 
resources to adapt to extreme changes — especially unexpected ones.
Half of the world’s population earns less than $2 per day and largely depends 
on public services. In some developing countries, public services may not 
be able to cope with the aftermath of extreme weather events brought on by 
global warming. In other countries, public services don’t even exist, leaving 
the poor with few resources to cope. As the IPCC says, “This does not neces-
sarily mean that ‘the poor are lost’; they have other coping mechanisms, but 
climate change might go beyond what traditional coping mechanisms can 
handle.”
Women
You’ve likely heard or read about women’s rights and women’s equality 
issues. But you probably don’t often hear about women’s inequality when it 
comes to global warming. The people working closely on the climate change 
issues are only now giving it attention.
You may not realize it, but your gender (your sex and how it influences the 
roles you play in society) affects the degree to which global warming may 
hurt you. In both rich and poor countries, women tend to bear the brunt 
of the climate change’s negative impacts, mostly because they tend to be 
whole lot poorer. In fact, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) reports that 
70 percent of the world’s poor are women.
Women in developing nations
In many developing countries, women are frequently agricultural workers. 
They’re the main family caretakers responsible for producing food for the 
family. The IUCN reports that women produce 70 to 80 percent of the food 
in sub-Saharan Africa. Latin America isn’t far behind at 65 percent. Scientists 
predict that these poorest regions are also the ones to be hardest hit by cli-
mate change, which we discuss in the section, “Paying the Price for Global 
Warming,” earlier in this chapter. When climate change negatively affects 
a region, men often migrate to cities to find better paying jobs, leaving the 
women and children behind to try to survive on the land, which is no longer 
productive because of climate impacts such as drought.

139
 Chapter 9: Hitting Home: Global Warming’s Direct Effect on People
How natural disasters caused by climate change affect women
Natural disasters, which will increase in the wake of climate change, affect 
women and men differently. Women, as main caregivers, are more likely to be 
indoors — particularly in developing countries — when a disaster occurs and 
won’t be able to escape. Even if they do survive, women tend to stay within 
the community longer afterwards to care for their families, thus exposing 
themselves to deadly diseases.
Although not linked to global warming, the grave impact that natural disasters 
have on women can be seen in the death toll from the major Asian tsunami 
that struck at the end of 2005 and hit the province of Aceh in Indonesia, where 
75 percent of those who died were women.
When the death toll from natural disasters has significant gender differences, 
the resulting gender imbalance in the society can have major, long-term nega-
tive consequences. The Asian tsunami left the society with a three-to-one 
ratio of males to females. With so many mothers gone, the area experienced 
increases in sexual assaults, prostitution, and a lack of education for girls. 
Research in this area is still in its infancy, but the IPCC has reported that 
women are more likely than men to suffer from post-traumatic stress 
disorders after living through a disaster and that men are likely to commit 
domestic violence against women after natural disasters. This is worrying 
because climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency 
of storms and extreme weather events around the world.
Gotelind Alber: Getting gender on the agenda
Gotelind Alber, a German physicist who’s 
worked in the energy and climate policy sector 
for 20 years, is bringing gender issues into the 
discussion on climate change. Whether work-
ing in the fields of science, technology, climate 
change, or policy development, she has always 
worked to put gender on the agenda. She co-
founded the international network Women for 
Climate Justice.
Among her long list of projects is the “Climate 
for Change: Gender equality and climate 
policy” project. The goal of this European-based 
initiative is to
  Help balance the participation of women and 
men in creating climate-related policies.
  Address the fact that major climate change–
related sectors (such as energy, transporta-
tion, and buildings) are mostly run by males.
This project’s aim is to stress the importance 
of a balanced gender view in decision making. 
They’re working with ten European cities to 
integrate a gender perspective into their cli-
mate change policies. More information and 
the ongoing results of this project can be found 
at www.climateforchange.net.

Political Progress: 
Fighting Global 
Warming Nationally 
and Internationally

In This Part . . .
G
overnments are on the frontlines of the fight against 
global warming. In this part, we investigate what 
governments can do at every level, from your local mayor 
to the leader of your country. Because climate change is a 
global matter, national leaders need to collaborate, as well; 
we look at how countries are banding together. One group 
of nations, however, is particularly challenged by global 
warming; in the last chapter in this part, we look at how 
developing nations can begin to cope with this problem.

What Governments Can Do
In This Chapter
 Getting the goods on what your government can do for the climate

 Identifying cities, regions, and countries that are saving money while reducing carbon
M
any people can be cranky about their country’s government and 
cynical about its motives and whether it can really make any positive 
changes. And no one likes to pay taxes, even if those taxes do pay for basic 
services that people need, such as garbage pick-up, drinkable water, schools, 
and so on. Governments can often seem intrusive, taking your money and 
telling you what to do instead of the other way around.
Ever the optimists, we like to take a more positive spin on governments. 
A government is the servant of the people in a democracy. In the battle 
against global warming, governments are invaluable allies in stopping — and 
reversing — climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) reports that reducing greenhouse gases as much as the planet needs 
requires government leadership in the form of regulations and programs.
In this chapter, we take a look at how governments can fight — and are 
fighting — climate change through initiating programs, and regulating and 
taxing emissions. Knowing what solutions governments can enact empow-
ers you as a voter; you can knowledgably select candidates whose climate 
change plan seems like it’ll be the most effective. Beyond that, by letting 
candidates know that you’re voting for action on climate change, you will 
encourage all candidates to give this crucial issue a higher priority. We also 
share some success stories, so you can see what your votes can do!

144
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally
If They Had a Million Dollars . . . 
(Wait — They Do!)
When it comes to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, money is a powerful 
tool. Governments can create ways that people and companies benefit finan-
cially by making the right environmental choices. These incentives can take 
the form of tax credits and rebates, or governments can directly fund initia-
tives that plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Governments can also 
tax — as you probably know all too well. Taxes flow to government coffers 
The non-political political issue
Climate change has become a hot political 
issue. Depending on the political culture of your 
country, the issue is non-partisan, pan-partisan, 
or more than a little partisan.
In some countries — such as the U.S., Canada, 
and Australia — the conservative versus liberal 
fight on climate change has never been more 
heated. The defeat of John Howard’s govern-
ment in Australia in 2007 may well be the first 
election globally in which climate change was 
a significant factor. New Prime Minister Paul 
Rudd made ratifying the Kyoto Protocol one 
of his top priorities, delivering on his elec-
tion promise within days of becoming Prime 
Minister. In the U.S. and Canada, parties to 
the right of the political spectrum have consis-
tently opposed the Kyoto Protocol. (The situa-
tion is more complex at the state and provincial 
levels, however. The governments of California 
and British Columbia, arguably the most pro-
gressive jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada, 
respectively, both have “right-wing” govern-
ments.) At the time of publication, however, 
things seem like they may change in the States; 
the U.S. Republicans, led by John McCain, favor 
action on the issue.
In Europe, however, the fight against global 
warming isn’t as divided along party lines. In 
the U.K., the social democratic government is in 
power, and the conservative opposition is chal-
lenging the effectiveness of the government’s 
efforts to address the climate crisis. The right-
wing president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, has 
been very progressive on the climate front. 
Despite some criticism of his national crush 
on nuclear power, he’s leading the country 
and befriending environmentalists along the 
way. His inspiring speeches stress the need for 
major countries such as China to lead the way 
in low-emission development. France and China 
recently signed a joint statement committing to 
a partnership to help each other reduce harmful 
emissions.
Perhaps the most influential conservative lead-
ership on climate change has been from German 
Chancellor Angela Merkel. She was Minister of 
the Environment in the early 1990s when the 
mandate to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol was just 
beginning, and Merkel surprised some observers 
by maintaining the previous left-leaning govern-
ment’s course for greenhouse gas reductions 
when her party came to power. She also led 
the European Union in the same year that she 
helped push for major reductions in energy use. 
In 2007, she led G8 discussions, keeping a focus 
on climate change within the G8.

145
 Chapter 10: Voting for Your Future: What Governments Can Do
for public services. But tax policies can also send a message — by what 
gets taxed and what gets subsidized. Governments can make reducing 
carbon-based fuels a smart financial decision by taxing carbon.
Creating incentives
An excellent way for governments to encourage proper behavior (climate 
change–related or otherwise) is to offer incentives — a sort of reward that 
encourages people (or organizations) to act in a certain manner. You were 
probably offered incentives as a little kid to get good grades or tidy up your 
room. (Governments are likely to offer more than chocolate sundaes to 
entice people to help fight global warming, however.)
 
Incentives can come in many forms: a direct cash return or rebate, a tax break, 
or a lower consumer price thanks to subsidies to the manufacturers. Not all 
subsidies and incentives are announced and heralded. Some are embedded 
deep in a tax system and allow corporations to write off costs and reduce the 
taxes they have to pay.
Incentives are popular with government officials, who would rather reward 
good behavior than risk alienating the electorate through regulations and 
taxes. Observers such as the IPCC argue that incentives are most effective 
when governments use them in combination with regulations, which we talk 
about in the section “Laying Down the Law,” later in this chapter. Otherwise, 
it’s a case of too much carrot, not enough stick.
Here’s a list of incentives that the IPCC recommends:
 
 Agriculture: Most governments already subsidize agriculture; to help 
combat climate change, governments can subsidize farmers who take 
active steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by such measures 
as improving land and soil management and using efficient farming 
methods. (We talk about how farmers can go green in Chapter 14.)
 
 Consumer goods: Because low-emission products can sometimes cost a 
little more than inefficient wasteful ones, the government can encourage 
people to buy the more expensive product by footing some of the bill. A 
few examples include the following:
 
• Canada: The government offers grants of up to $5,000 so that 
owners can retrofit homes to make them more energy efficient.
 
• Japan: The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry offers 
subsidies for homeowners buying automated systems such as 
thermostats and electricity regulators, which help reduce energy 
consumption.
 
• United States: The federal government offers rebates to anyone 
buying a hybrid car.

146
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally
 
 Forestry: Subsidies to this industry could increase the amount of forest 
space, reduce or eliminate the logging of old-growth forests (which store 
far more carbon than newly planted forests), and encourage forestry 
companies to manage harvested forests in a sustainable fashion, keeping 
the ecosystem and soils healthy. (Check out Chapter 2 to find out why 
trees and soils are important to the climate.)
 
 Waste management: National or regional governments could offer finan-
cial incentives to encourage good waste management practices within 
their cities and communities. These incentives could include encourag-
ing the diversion of waste from landfills through reduced packaging and 
recycling. For the remaining waste, initiatives could include incentives 
to capture and/or use methane-containing landfill gas, or funding local 
purchases of technology that breaks down waste more effectively than 
landfills or processes the methane gas emitted from landfills into clean 
electricity.
Planning for emissions trading
Emissions trading, which is sometimes called cap and trade, is a complex 
and controversial approach to reducing greenhouse gases. In this system, 
a government decides how much carbon a geographical region (such as a 
city) or a sector (such as all facilities that generate electricity from coal) is 
allowed to emit. The allowable level is called the cap. The trading comes in 
when an emitter produces a level of carbon less than its cap — it can sell the 
difference to another emitter that has gone over its limit. The promise of the 
revenue from selling their extra credits encourages companies to accelerate 
the adoption of new low-pollution technologies. Over time, the government 
lowers the cap, gradually reducing the allowable credits. The intended result 
is less and less pollution.
Within North America, non-greenhouse gas emissions trading has had some 
historical success on other environmental issues such as air pollution. Los 
Angeles, for example, improved air quality through trading nitrogen oxide 
and volatile organic compounds (liquid chemicals that can immediately 
evaporate into gas at room temperature) credits. The province of Ontario 
trades nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, and it’s now setting up a larger 
cap-and-trade program with the neighboring province of Quebec.
Europe has had an active greenhouse gas market since 2005. It was the first 
market of its kind to span different countries and numerous sectors. The 
European Union (EU) carbon market is the model used around the world 
for building a market that trades carbon dioxide emissions and credits. This 
system may, in 2011, begin to include airline emissions, a major and growing 
piece of global carbon dioxide emissions.

147
 Chapter 10: Voting for Your Future: What Governments Can Do
Carbon trading has its upside and its downside. On the one hand, it regu-
lates emissions measurements and enables governments to hold companies 
accountable for the measured emissions. On the other hand, putting a price 
on carbon is a thorny matter. Do governments charge for only the carbon 
being directly emitted by burning coal? Or do they put a price on that and on 
the emissions produced by mining out the coal and shipping it?
#

Emissions trading is often attacked as a “license to pollute.” (Of course, in 
most jurisdictions in North America no restrictions whatsoever exist on emit-
ting greenhouse gases; right now, people and industry can emit as much as 
they desire — for free!) It can actually end up being ineffective if the carbon 
price is set too low. The European Union Emissions Trading System, for 
example, has been in place for four years, yet countries such as Germany are 
still putting up new coal plants because the added cost of the cap and trade is 
so marginal that it doesn’t influence their decisions. Market mechanisms can 
work, but only if the price is effective and governments monitor trading to pre-
vent cheating and steadily reduce the cap over time.
Industries can engage in emissions trading without government involvement, 
too — that is, they can limit their net greenhouse gas emissions on a voluntary 
basis. Although the voluntary market expanded rapidly in 2005 and 2006, it is 
still 1/100 the size of the regulatory market in greenhouse gas emissions trading. 
Take a look at Chapter 14 to read about the Chicago Climate Exchange, the 
first private emissions trading market.
Putting programs into place
One way governments can fight climate change is through engaging and 
empowering their population. By supporting research, educating people, and 
helping people adapt to the changes that global warming will bring, govern-
ments can put the tools for survival in the public’s hands.
Research
Government funding for energy research skyrocketed in the mid-1970s, 
during the oil shock (when crude oil prices rose sharply), to encourage 
scientists and companies to develop alternative energy sources. But when 
the first crisis faded, so did interest. Government investment in energy 
research around the world is half of what it was in 1980. Now that the world 
is facing a “climate shock” and is reeling from high oil prices, governments 
can encourage similar initiatives.
The private sector and government researchers need funding to develop low-
emission technologies at roughly the same rate that the climate is changing. 
Low-emission technology is essentially any kind of technology that reduces 

148
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally
greenhouse gas emissions: It can be renewable energy technology, carbon 
capture and storage (see Chapter 13), or more efficient appliances and 
lighting (see Chapter 18).
The IPCC recommends that governments invest in two types of research 
to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop renewable energy 
technologies:
 
 Private research is done by companies. The downside is that the results 
are owned and sometimes even patented by the company, restricting 
access to the new technologies they develop. The upside is that results 
drive the research, and that research is often in line with the market and 
what consumers want — in other words, it gets the job done.
 
 Public research is done by the government itself. The upside is that 
anyone can study and use the results, but public research often takes a 
long time because no market push drives the research.
Education and awareness
Global warming is a complex issue — you could even write a book about it! 
Not surprisingly, people often have a lot of misconceptions about climate 
change and what they can do to help reduce their carbon emissions. Because 
not everyone’s going to read Global Warming For Dummies, governments can 
play a big role in educating people so that those people can make informed 
choices.
 
The United Kingdom’s government has done an excellent job of educating its 
citizens about climate change. Here are a couple of the initiatives launched by 
the British government:
 
 A national climate communications campaign, dubbed Act on CO2 (See 
Chapter 22 for information on this great Web resource.)
 
 A large-scale, climate-awareness, art exhibition, featuring world-class 
photographers whose pictures portray the global impacts of climate 
change, as well as the various global tactics taken to reduce carbon 
emissions
One great way for governments to raise climate change awareness is to 
include it in school curriculums, creating a profound effect on society when 
these students grow up. Finding out about climate change at an early age 
could influence decisions these students make for the rest of their lives.
Of course, awareness campaigns don’t necessarily reduce personal green-
house gas emissions — in fact, ample evidence demonstrates that education 
and exhortation on their own produce very little effect. Arguably, they do 

149
 Chapter 10: Voting for Your Future: What Governments Can Do
create a heightened awareness of global warming. More importantly, public 
awareness is essential to ensuring that the public understands and accepts 
other carbon-dioxide-reducing measures that the government may implement.
Adaptation
The climate is already changing, in some areas more than others. It’s going 
to keep changing over the next century, even if humanity is successful in 
keeping the overall magnitude of climate change to below truly dangerous 
levels at the global scale. Governments can play a key role in dealing with 
the changes civilization can no longer prevent by providing funding and 
resources to help people and businesses adapt.
 
Global warming will bring profound changes to the globe as a whole — but the 
particular types and scales of these impacts will be profoundly affected by local 
conditions. Climate change won’t just have general global effects — over time 
it will create specific impacts within your very own neighborhood. Because the 
changes people will face vary from place to place, local governments (city or 
regional) will be best equipped to address these problems — one-size-fits-all 
solutions won’t work. National governments that signed and ratified the UN 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (see Chapter 11) agreed to under-
take adaptation planning. Several countries, such as the Dominican Republic, 
Cuba, and others in the Caribbean, are also undertaking regional planning. But 
fundamentally, although climate change is happening globally, people need to 
react locally.
 
Miami-Dade County in Florida is a leading example of what local governments 
can do. Not only is the county committed to reducing emissions, it’s trying 
to make sure that people are prepared for the climate changes predicted, 
including sea level rise, salt-contaminated drinking water, and erosion. 
Miami-Dade has formed a Climate Change Advisory Task Force to make rec-
ommendations. As one of a handful of local governments in the United States 
already worrying about this problem, Miami-Dade is serving as a pilot project 
for Climate Resilient Communities, led by the International Council for Local 
Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI). (See the sidebar “Local leadership,” in this 
chapter, for more about the ICLEI.)
One tragic example of a failure to adapt is New Orleans. In light of global 
warming, the city council had just realized that they needed to take action 
to protect the city from extreme weather events. In the summer of 2005, the 
Mayor spoke out as a signatory to the Mayors’ Climate Protection Agreement, 
which endorsed the Kyoto Protocol. (See the section, “Success Stories,” 
later in this chapter, for more about this agreement.) He pointed out that 
New Orleans was one of the most vulnerable cities in the United States to 
severe weather events, and would be even more vulnerable given the trends 
of global warming. The city realized that they needed to repair the dikes and 
levees, and beef up emergency planning, but Katrina hit before they could 
make the changes.

150
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally
Here are several examples of actions that regional governments can take to 
help their citizens adapt:
 
 Diversifying crops: Encouraging farmers to grow a wide range of crops 
helps governments protect both the food supply and farmers’ incomes 
by ensuring that those farmers don’t put all their eggs in one basket, so 
to speak. For example, if a pest that became rampant because of high 
temperatures causes the barley crop to fail, the farmers will still have 
the food and income from the corn and wheat crops that the pest didn’t 
affect.
 
 Expanding green space and tree cover in cities: This measure absorbs 
runoff from large rainfall and reduces local temperatures, lowers demand 
for air conditioning, and stores carbon dioxide within the growing trees and 
associated soil. (Flip back to Chapter 2 for carbon cycle fundamentals.)
 
 Improving floodwater management systems: This involves taking extra 
measures to deal with more extreme and frequent flooding — such as 
making sure the street sewer system is working and maybe adding more 
street draining systems. Less asphalt and more green space in cities 
Local leadership
The Local Governments for Sustainability 
(formerly the International Council for Local 
Environmental Initiatives) — known as ICLEI 
for short — started as a partnership between 
200 city and town governments from around 
the world in 1990. It’s grown into a larger part-
nership of over 700 governments that share a 
strong commitment to sustainable development. 
Their projects have a large range of objectives, 
including the following:
  Cities for Climate Protection: ICLEI’s flag-
ship campaign puts policies and practices 
in place to reduce the city or town’s green-
house gas emissions and improve the city 
or town’s quality of life.
  Sustainable Communities and Cities: This 
program’s goal is to help cities foster jus-
tice, security, resilience, viable economies, 
and healthy environments.
  Water Campaign: This program measures 
how much water a city or community is 
using, develops a plan that provides tar-
gets for efficient water use, works to meet 
those goals, and continually measures and 
improves those goals. Water use and infra-
structure require a lot of energy. By con-
serving water, you can conserve energy 
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
  Biodiversity Initiative: This initiative 
increases the local government’s role in 
conserving the diversity of plants, animals, 
and entire ecosystems within or around a 
city or community. In the same way that you 
try to keep your immune system healthy so 
that your body can deal with and recover 
from a fever, this biodiversity project keeps 
ecosystems healthy so they can better deal 
with climate change.

151
 Chapter 10: Voting for Your Future: What Governments Can Do
slows rapid runoff to storm sewers, reducing erosion and downstream 
flooding. Governments might also want to rethink and rebuild water 
treatment plants; the water systems were built for a different climate.
 
 Improving or installing storm-warning systems: This involves preparing 
for more intense and more frequent storms — for example, by establish-
ing a way to notify everyone when a big storm is coming.
 
 Improving water management and watershed planning: Cities need 
to plan for more extreme droughts and more intense river runoff, and 
ensure that they’ll have drinkable water available for their citizens.
 
 Increasing disaster relief funds: Governments need to put aside more 
money for cleaning up after events such as hurricanes and flooding.
 
 Securing levies against flooding: Ensuring that the physical barriers 
protecting the city or town from flooding are strong and always being 
upgraded in advance of need enables cities and towns to continue to 
provide effective protection, even as the risk and intensity of flooding 
increases over the course of the 21st century.
 
 Setting building restrictions on coastlines: Governments can prevent 
the development of buildings too close to the water’s edge to avoid loss 
of property due to erosion, which will be accelerated due to rising sea 
levels that will come with climate change.
 
 Shifting tourism and recreation opportunities: Tourism draws can be 
adapted to the changing climate and what the climate might be like in 
ten years. Some ski hills, for instance, may no longer be in operation 
because rising temperatures will rob them of reliable winter snow cover.
 
 Subsidizing farmers who may need to relocate: Governments may need 
to support farmers who have to move unexpectedly because their crops 
are no longer growing in the changed climate.
The cost and effectiveness of planning for adaptation are uncertain, but 
governments can gain insight from other groups’ experiences. Australia, for 
example, has been emphasizing water management. Inuit communities in 
northern Canada are hunting differently to adjust to a changing climate, but 
are maintaining their culture. The Netherlands is building even more coastal 
barriers to protect against rising sea levels. Ski resorts across the United 
States, Canada, Europe, and Australia are relying more on artificial snow to 
keep the slopes open.
 
Adaptation isn’t a response to just one particular storm or one melting glacier. 
It’s a way of thinking, a kind of climate mindfulness that governments need to 
integrate into the plans they’re already making. Australia already had a water 
management plan before climate change came along; climate change just 
added an extra angle — and urgency.

Cleaning up transportation
Although governments don’t control everything that has to do with transpor-
tation, they still have a fair amount of influence over it. And when it comes 
to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, transportation is one area in particular 
in which the industrialized nations can make dramatic changes — largely 
because they use some of the most inefficient forms of transportation on the 
face of the Earth!
 
Different levels of government control different pieces of transportation. 
City governments, for example, control the public transit and city vehicles, 
which include public-service vehicles, such as park vehicles, snow plows, and 
garbage trucks. National governments can decide that a vibrant national rail 
system matters — moving people quickly and reducing greenhouse gases. 
National governments can also control what kind of cars are sold in the 
region or in the country, where and whether highways or rail lines are built or 
upgraded, and how many lanes of traffic are dedicated to multiple-passenger 
cars on the highway.
Bringing back the bike
Many cities are recognizing that bicycles can provide an environmentally 
friendly alternative to cars on the road. Municipal initiatives to encourage 
cycling range from improving bike paths to routing cars away from down-
town areas. Many North Americans don’t view the bike as a year-round 
transportation solution, but the Dutch and the Danes see things differently; 
a large percentage of city dwellers cycle contentedly throughout the cold 
and wet winters of northern Europe. Getting the right kind of bike and having 
dedicated bike lanes helps to extend the length of the bike-riding season in 
just about any city.
One of the world’s most bike-friendly cities, thanks to its local government, 
is Amsterdam. There, you find separate bicycle lanes for each direction, with 
their own traffic lights that sync with those for cars. Spots where you can lock 
up your bike abound. City buses are equipped with bike racks, which passen-
gers can use to stow their bikes when they board the bus. This sort of inter-
modal transport — switching between different ways to get around — is critical 
because it gives commuters convenient and flexible options, and makes it easy 
for people to not depend on their cars. (Pedal over to Chapter 17 for more 
about the benefits of bicycles.)
Investing in public transportation
Simply by providing adequate mass transit, municipal governments play a 
big role in reducing greenhouse gases. Driving in stop-and-go city traffic pro-
duces the majority of car emissions. The IPCC says that in a high-density city 
(which is ideal for public transit), 10 percent more buses on the road, filled 
with people who would otherwise drive their car, could reduce car emissions 
by 9 percent. But governments can do more.

153
 Chapter 10: Voting for Your Future: What Governments Can Do
Many cities now have energy-efficient public transit buses. Your municipal 
government can run its public transportation fleets on alternative fuels or 
blends. In Halifax, Nova Scotia, whenever a bus goes by, you smell fish and 
chips coming from the tailpipe because its city buses run on recycled frying 
oil. Cities can also use gas-electric hybrids and good old electric trolley 
buses. (See Chapter 13 for more on alternative fuels.)
To get people to ride their energy-efficient public transportation, municipal 
governments can encourage riders in a number of ways. In London, youth 
under the age of 18 travel for free on major bus routes. Some countries, such 
as Canada, offer tax rebates to people who buy transit passes. Other regions 
create dedicated lanes on their roads to ensure a swift trip for public transit 
users. If it’s faster to take the bus, why drive?
 
Buses aren’t the only form of public transportation. Trains are already one 
of the most efficient modes of transportation, and they have the potential to 
become 40 percent more efficient by using new technology, according to the 
IPCC. (We take a closer look at public transportation in Chapter 17.)
Greening gas
Fossil fuel, which powers just about all vehicles, is the culprit for much of the 
world’s greenhouse gas emissions. (Refer to Chapter 4 for more about fossil 
fuels.) Although governments can’t force everyone into hybrid or electric 
cars, they can stipulate just how much fossil fuel goes into gas and how effi-
cient cars must be at using that gas.
Governments can regulate fuel content, mandating that all gas sold at the 
pump has to contain a certain minimum percentage of an alternative fuel. 
For example, the other day, Zoë filled up at a local gas station to find that 
the regular fuel was now 25 percent ethanol, which meant her vehicle emis-
sions were cut before she even restarted the engine. (Most ethanol produced 
in North America does have some major problems, which we talk about in 
Chapter 13, so buyer beware.) This type of regulation also creates a market 
for alternative fuels such as ethanol and bio-diesel. (See Chapter 13 for more 
on alternative fuels.)
The next French revolution: Velib!
When Paris celebrated the anniversary of the 
French Revolution, the city launched a new 
revolution (no guillotines involved) — a bike 
revolution! July 15, 2007, saw the opening of 
a city-run bicycle rental service planned to 
grow ultimately to 1,400 rental stations offering 
more than 20,500 bikes for hire. Everything is 
computerized — you just swipe your card, and 
away you ride. Plus, the first half hour is free. 
Many universities and cities around the world 
are taking this same initiative — making it 
easier for people to pick up a bike anywhere 
and ride. (Velib is a French play on words for 
“bicycle freedom.”)

154
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally
The International Energy Agency suggests that governments need to use 
subsidies and trade policies to increase the production of low-emissions 
fuels and technology. If your government adopts this approach, some of your 
taxes that are currently going towards oil and coal products would go to 
alternative fuel technology. We discuss how governments can fund research 
in the section “Putting programs into place,” earlier in this chapter.
Dealing with personal vehicles
Many people have a love affair with their cars, we know. But although we 
hate to break up a beautiful relationship between someone and their SUV, 
cars are big contributors to greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. 
Governments could definitely help nudge the auto industry and people 
toward making smarter transportation decisions.
Although most governments already regulate fuel economy, they could put 
the pedal to the metal and step up those requirements, demanding that a 
tank of gas take the car farther. In the 1970s, in the aftermath of the first oil 
shock, the United States first introduced regulations for cars, requiring all 
domestically produced cars to exceed an average 27.5 miles per gallon.
The IPCC says that national governments could potentially cut their country’s 
car-related greenhouse gases in half by 2030 just by requiring automobile 
manufacturers to produce more energy-efficient cars. Check out Chapter 17 
for more on car fuel economy.
Municipally, cities could make parking spaces smaller. If your vehicle is too 
big, you pay for two parking spots, rather than one! Alternately, cities could 
reduce the number of parking spaces they require in new developments — 
particularly if they’re located close to transit services, increasing the value 
of parking spaces, and the convenience of not needing to find — and pay 
for — a parking spot. These and other measures could encourage people to 
drive smaller, more efficient cars. The City of Portland, Oregon, has gone one 
better. It has virtually eliminated downtown parking spaces!
More cities could pass anti-idling bylaws, ticketing people caught leaving 
their engines running unnecessarily.
Redefining long-term investments
The government makes investments with its money just like you can. But 
the government doesn’t put its funds into stocks and bonds. Rather, govern-
ments select industries or economic sectors that they feel benefit their 

155
 Chapter 10: Voting for Your Future: What Governments Can Do
citizens one way or another, perhaps in a perfectly straightforward fashion 
(for example, by providing jobs) or in a less immediate, more long-range way 
(by encouraging farmers to stay on the land, for instance).
Most governments invest in (or subsidize) the energy sector. Typically, this 
investment means that they provide funds to oil companies, but governments 
could use subsidies to send the energy sector in very different directions. 
Governments could financially support companies that develop renewable 
sources of energy, rather than supporting those searching for fossil fuels 
such as oil. According to the IPCC, reducing fossil fuel subsidies is an effec-
tive way to wean the industrial world off its oil addiction. The IPCC warns 
that oil will remain civilization’s primary fuel source as long as it remains 
subsidized by governments. The IPCC suggests reducing these subsidies 
(along with establishing taxes or carbon charges on fossil fuels and providing 
subsidies for renewable energy producers) as measures towards shifting to 
renewable energy supplies.
According to the European Renewable Energy Council (EREC), taxpayers 
worldwide currently subsidize oil, coal, gas, and nuclear energy to the tune of 
$250 to $300 billion annually, with some of these subsidies guaranteed for up 
to two decades. EREC notes that the imbalance between the subsidies that 
these fuels get and what is spent on renewable energy sources will hamper 
the development of sustainable fuels.
If governments want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they need to shift 
subsidies toward low-emission renewable energy. This shift would be more 
than an investment for the current citizens of the country; it would be an 
investment for future generations.
 
Governments are already moving in this direction. The IPCC reports that coal 
subsidies have dropped in the last decade around the world. By shifting such 
subsidies to renewable energy sources, governments can help those sources 
develop — at no additional cost to the taxpayer. Many governments are 
already beginning to invest in renewable energy, including the following:
 
 Australia: In 2000, the Aussie government developed a $303 million 
program that would cover half of the start-up cost of renewable and 
off-the-grid power generation. It started as a way to reduce depen-
dence on diesel fuel and has since grown to reduce dependence on 
all fossil fuels.
 
 Finland: The national program called Energy Aid, specifically for com-
panies and corporations, has been in place since 1999. It covers 25 to 
40 percent of renewable energy and energy conservation projects.
 
 Germany: Through the Renewable Energy Sources Act, the government 
puts the end-consumer cost of renewable energy on par with other types 
of energy by sharing the cost with the energy company.

156
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally
 
 United Kingdom: In 2002, the government initiated a large-scale solar 
demonstration project, paying $63.6 million to install photovoltaic 
solar systems. These funds covered 55 percent of the costs for public 
projects and 40 percent for large companies. Building on the success 
of that project, the government committed $172 million dollars in 2006 
toward energy-efficient buildings that generate their own power. Both 
businesses and public places, such as schools and community centers, 
can get government funding to install solar panels, heat pumps, or other 
major energy-saving technologies that directly power their buildings.
Solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal energy (see Chapter 13) used to be futuristic 
ideas, but countries around the world are using them today. In fact, in 2005, 
these forms of energy produced 2.2 percent of the world’s electricity — 
18.2 percent when hydroelectricity (mostly old-fashioned large hydro) is added 
in. This statistic could rise to between 30 and 35 percent by 2030 (including 
hydroelectricity) if the cost of renewable energy continues to drop — and gov-
ernment investment can go a long way toward ensuring that it does.
Laying Down the Law
Regulations and taxes: hardly the way to win new friends. But as controver-
sial and unpopular as they can be, they’re vital tools for governments that 
want to control greenhouse gas emissions. Governments can regulate every-
thing from the amount of energy your refrigerator can use, to how much 
insulation your house needs, to the amount of gas it takes to move your car a 
mile (or a kilometer). Taxes can be a powerful disincentive to individuals and 
companies; stop polluting, or you have to pay!
 
What level of government regulates what activity differs from country to 
country — and sector to sector. For example, in Australia, Canada, the United 
Kingdom, and the United States, the federal government has the power to set 
fuel efficiency standards, whereas state, provincial, or territorial governments 
have control of building codes.
Improving building regulations
The way houses and larger buildings are constructed is as much a product 
of policy as it is engineering. Building regulations apply to a building’s struc-
tural elements, the materials used, their proper installation, and so on — but 
regulations can also control home energy use. By stipulating how the house 
is insulated and what sort of doors and windows to use, building regulations 
can determine whether your new home will be an energy guzzler or an energy 
miser over its lifetime. (We look at how buildings can be environmentally 
friendly in Chapter 14.)

157
 Chapter 10: Voting for Your Future: What Governments Can Do
 
When it comes to battling climate change, the IPCC reports that how people 
build, insulate, and heat their buildings has more potential to reduce green-
house gas emissions than changes in energy, industry, or agriculture. With the 
right regulations in place, building-related emissions could be cut 30 percent 
by 2030 — without affecting the profitability of the construction industry.
In addition to improving standard building features, governments could 
demand that new buildings include certain elements that would make those 
buildings green (not to mention much cooler — or warmer, depending on the 
season). They could mandate that all new houses and other buildings include 
solar panels to help heat and cool them, or that contractors build smart 
homes — buildings equipped with automated systems that control heat and 
lights to conserve energy.
Regulating energy use
National and local governments hold great regulatory power over energy 
use. Greenhouse gas emission reduction targets are set internationally, but 
national or even more local levels of government have to regulate people’s 
and companies’ behavior to meet these targets.
The honor system: Self-regulation
One very basic form of regulation is self-
regulation, in which the affected parties police 
themselves. As you can probably guess, politi-
cians prefer self-regulation to putting emission 
limits in place. Having someone volunteer to do 
something is much easier than having to tell 
them to do it.
The major benefit of this type of regulation is 
simplicity. First, industries promise to reduce 
their greenhouse gas emissions below a self-
determined baseline before the reductions. 
Then, governments check to see whether 
they’re being compliant. If they are, great. If not, 
well, better luck next time — so, self-regulation 
doesn’t guarantee greenhouse gas emissions 
reductions. Compliance is voluntary, and indus-
tries can easily set their reduction goal at zero.
Although successes are possible, self-regulation 
usually doesn’t work, and it hasn’t been proven 
to work at all on a larger scale. China is attempt-
ing to make it work by partnering with its 1,000 
biggest industries, which draw on a third of the 
country’s energy. The industries will measure, 
report on, and reduce their energy use through 
conservation and energy efficiency. The govern-
ment will support the industries by promoting 
energy-saving initiatives, monitoring the prog-
ress, and helping to develop the training and 
implementation of the projects. Although it’s a 
step in the right direction, the program doesn’t 
have any specific targets.

Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally
Here are a few ways that governments can encourage more responsible 
energy consumption through regulation:
 
 Clear labeling: Governments can require producers to label all appli-
ances and mark how much energy they use, and — most importantly — 
governments can decide what level of energy use qualifies as efficient. A 
producer would have to meet that requirement before selling their prod-
ucts as efficient.
 
 Measuring usage: Measuring is the first step to setting a target for 
reduction. California has installed smart meters in homes, which allow 
electricity consumers to see on an hourly basis how they’re doing in 
their conservation efforts. Studies have proven that when people can 
see how much energy they’re using, they cut back on their consump-
tion. Watching the costs add up helps people remember to avoid peak 
demand periods (when more consumers are pulling power at the same 
time) for some energy-draining activities.
 
 Setting quotas: Governments can stipulate that major users of energy 
purchase a certain percentage of their power from renewable sources. 
Australia, for example, requires major buyers of electricity — such as 
industries — to buy a portion of their energy from wind farms and solar-
power producers. If a user doesn’t meet the quota, it must pay a fine.
 
 Setting targets: Governments can encourage the development of 
renewable energy sources by setting targets for the entire country. 
Industrialized member countries of the Kyoto Protocol, for example, 
each have a target of their own, as well as a collective global target of 
5.5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. Governments can also require 
business and industry to set a target to lower emissions.
Taxing the polluters
“There is no such thing as a good tax,” Winston Churchill once said. We 
respectfully disagree. The most significant government power is taxation. 
Government uses taxes not only to raise revenue for the state, but also to 
discourage certain forms of behavior — think of the taxes on cigarettes 
and alcohol. Governments in some countries apply a similar tax policy to 
greenhouse gas emissions.
Governments could encourage people to stop producing greenhouse gas 
emissions by placing a fee on those emissions. The economic impact of such 
taxes has been minimal, even positive, as long as this fee is offset by reducing 
taxes on other things, such as income, jobs, and profit. This tax reassignment 
is called tax shifting. It’s not about more taxes; it’s about different taxes.

159
 Chapter 10: Voting for Your Future: What Governments Can Do
Most economists agree that this sort of tax, commonly called a carbon tax, is 
the most sensible and cost-effective approach to reducing greenhouse gases. 
No less an economic expert than the former head of the U.S. Federal Reserve, 
Paul Volcker noted that the argument that says taxes on oil or carbon emis-
sions would ruin an economy is “fundamentally false. First of all, I don’t think 
it is going to have that much of an impact on the economy overall. Second 
of all, if you don’t do it, you can be sure that the economy will go down the 
drain in the next 30 years.”
So far, carbon taxes are far more common in Europe than in North America. 
Norway has reported great success in using taxes to reduce both carbon 
dioxide emissions and HFC/PFC (the most powerful of the greenhouse gases) 
emissions. The most competitive economies in the EU have carbon taxes. 
Today, only three jurisdictions in North America have some form of carbon 
tax: Hawaii, Quebec, and British Columbia. Hawaii adds a surcharge to every 
barrel of oil shipped into the island state. The provinces of Quebec and 
British Columbia have a more universal carbon tax, and British Columbia’s 
approach includes money back to the taxpayer. Now endorsed by the Los 
Angeles Times and New York Times, carbon taxes are likely to make their way 
into the U.S., as well.
 
The “carbon” in carbon tax can refer either to carbon dioxide emissions alone 
or to carbon dioxide equivalents — meaning all greenhouse gas emissions 
measured as a factor of carbon dioxide. The carbon market in Europe, for 
example, considers only carbon dioxide. New Zealand uses a carbon market 
that includes carbon dioxide equivalents. Both systems work, but those that 
use carbon dioxide equivalents can potentially have a greater effect because 
they include all greenhouse gases.

The IPCC warns of a couple of problems associated with taxing greenhouse 
gas emissions: The taxes can’t ensure actual emission reductions (polluters 
may be perfectly willing to pay to keep on polluting), and the taxes are tough 
to put in place from a political point of view because few things are as unwel-
come to voters as taxes. On the other hand, carbon taxes can be implemented 
quickly, and are simple to administer, both of which make them attractive to 
governments gutsy enough to introduce them. All things considered though, 
taxes offer an effective emissions-reducing tool.
 
London’s levy on cars entering the downtown area has been a very successful 
measure to reduce greenhouse gases, improve air quality, and relieve down-
town congestion. The initial protests let up because Londoners agreed that 
the city was vastly more livable with fewer cars clogging the heart of the city.

Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally
Success Stories
Throughout this chapter, we talk about what governments can or should do to 
help reduce greenhouse gases. Don’t get us wrong, however — governments 
all over the world, at every level, are already doing leading-edge work, moving 
toward low-carbon technologies and ways of life.
Cities and towns
You hear “Think globally, act locally” a lot these days — you need a big-
picture perspective, but you have to make changes on a small scale, within 
your own city or town. Cities in industrialized countries can really reduce 
local greenhouse gas emissions, as many cities have already discovered.
Cities often act as a team to support each other in climate initiatives. In the 
United States, the Mayors’ Climate Protection Agreement (the brainchild of 
Seattle’s mayor, Greg Nickels) has a target similar to the Kyoto Protocol’s — 
to reduce city emissions by 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 (for more 
about the Kyoto Protocol, see Chapter 11). More than 680 city mayors, rep-
resenting over 74 million citizens, have signed up so far. These mayors are 
making progress, even if the national and state governments in the United 
States aren’t committed to Kyoto targets.
Check out Table 10-1 for a list of cities that are leading the way to climate 
change solutions as members of the Cities for Climate Protection project, 
organized by the ICLEI.
Because so many factors contribute to greenhouse gases, many cities are 
concentrating their emission-reduction efforts on one aspect at a time. 
Rayong in Thailand installed a biogas facility to deal with the city’s waste 
and to create an alternative fuel source. Mareeba Shire Council in Australia is 
using heat-reflective paint on the roofs of major city buildings to keep them 
cool, thus reducing the energy used for air conditioning.
Transportation is another area in which cities are cleaning up. Green Fleet, a 
project of the Cities for Climate Protection initiative, reduces emissions from 
cities’ fleets of cars and trucks by ensuring that they’re driven less, elimi-
nated when possible, and that newly purchased vehicles are lower-emission. 
Hyderabad in India is improving traffic flow to lower the amount of time cars 
spend on the road and therefore reduce emissions. In Curitiba, Brazil, what 
began with the determination of its mayor to improve the bus system so that 
it would work better led to a phenomenal urban redesign that is centered 
around public transportation that is widely used, largely eliminating the 
need for cars. This initiative also made the city a more desirable place to 
live, increasing its tax base and quality of life. (For more about Curitiba, see 
Chapter 12.)

Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally
States, provinces, and territories
Governments at the state, provincial, or territorial level have a very impor-
tant role in fighting global warming. Regional governments that have had 
success tackling their greenhouse gas emissions have emphasized renewable 
energy standards, establishing programs to encourage energy efficiency and 
creating cap-and-trade programs for industry.
Successful solos
Going solo takes a lot of guts — whether it’s presenting to a group of people, 
performing on a stage, or doing something as minor as saving the world from 
climate change. Regional governments, such as those in the following list, 
are world leaders in greenhouse gas reductions, often without direction from 
their federal governments or any other regional governments:
 
 Flanders, Belgium: In this region, every electricity producer has to 
buy a certain amount of renewable energy. This policy started with a 
quota at 0.8 percent of its electricity in 2002, and it plans to build to 
6 percent in 2010. The regional government fines producers that fail to 
meet this quota; the fees are fed directly back into Flanders’ Renewable 
Energy Fund.
The power of town hall
The Alliance of World Mayors and Municipal 
Leaders released a declaration in 2005 at the 
UN Climate Change Conference in Montreal, 
announcing long-term goals that are among the 
most ambitious in the world: They want to cut 
their cities’ greenhouse gas emissions 30 per-
cent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 percent 
by 2050. Their short-term target is a 20-percent 
reduction below 1990 levels by 2010.
Building on that declaration, concerned mayors 
and municipalities created the Cities for Climate 
Protection program. This program works with 
over 800 cities that account for approximately 
15 percent of global human-caused carbon 
dioxide emissions. The project is lead by the 
International Council for Local Environmental 
Initiatives (ICLEI, also known as Local 
Governments for Sustainability). The initiative 
involves a five-step commitment:
  Keeping track of and predicting greenhouse 
gas emission levels
  Setting a greenhouse gas emissions reduc-
tion target
  Making a plan for how to reduce those 
greenhouse gas emissions
  Taking action on the plan and actually 
reducing the greenhouse gas emissions
  Keeping track of reductions and reporting 
on progress 
You can get a taste for what some of these 
800 cities are doing to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions by checking out Table 10-1.

163
 Chapter 10: Voting for Your Future: What Governments Can Do
 
 Victoria, Australia: This state has its own $92-million Greenhouse 
Strategy. This money went directly into climate change projects between 
2002 and 2004. The overarching goals were to build public awareness 
of climate change, reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions in Victoria, 
research climate impacts and adaptation strategies for the region, and 
look into opportunities for industry and business to reduce emissions. 
The result? Victoria’s industries are cutting emissions by 1.23 million 
metric tons a year, a regional building standard is in place that sets the 
bar for energy-efficient homes, and the region contains some of the larg-
est wind farms in the country. Next, the state plans to develop one of the 
largest wind farms in the world!
 
 Walloon, Belgium: Since 2003, the government of this region has 
required every electricity plant to get at least 3 percent of its energy 
from renewable sources, and it plans to build this percentage to 12 per-
cent by 2012. If a plant doesn’t follow the requirement, it’s fined. That 
cash goes straight to Walloon’s Energy Fund. Renewable energy produc-
ers can apply for support of about $100 per megawatt hour, which the 
Energy Fund finances.
Powerful partnerships
Like cities, some regional governments have found strength in partnerships. 
The U.S. state of California and the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo decided to 
work together to fight greenhouse gas emissions because, as their climate 
agreement notes, they’re in very similar situations. Both states
 
 Are major contributors to their respective national economies and have 
the largest state populations in their countries (both boast over 35 mil-
lion people)
 
 Have the highest energy use in their countries
 
 Suffer from major air pollution, which makes them interested in energy-
efficiency measures for their regions
 
 Are regarded as leaders in developing and implementing programs to 
lower car emissions
California and Sao Paulo’s agreement has three major commitments:
 
 Reduce the effects of air pollution
 
 Adapt to global warming by reducing the dangers their economies, 
people, and natural environments face
 
 Put policies in place that are stricter and cleaner than current 
measures

164
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally
The two states are working together on a number of projects. For example, 
California is working with Sao Paolo to implement a project to clean the air, 
using the same framework that California did with its Federal Clean Air Act. 
At the same time, Sao Paolo is working with California’s planners to help rep-
licate Brazil’s successful Bus Rapid Transit in California. A lot of the partner-
ship is based on sharing information — whether about ethanol, substituting 
diesel with natural gas, conserving state forests, or generating electricity 
from biomass.
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is another local government 
initiative aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. Made up of ten northeastern 
and mid-Atlantic U.S. states, from Maine down to Maryland, their regional 
target is a 10-percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from power 
plants by 2018. They plan to do this through a cap-and-trade system, which 
we discuss in the section “Planning for emission trading,” earlier in this 
chapter.
The action plan was consistent with climate goals that the Council of 
New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers negotiated for a 
larger region. The RGGI was the first plan to call for hard caps to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. To reduce emissions, the New 
The emission terminator: California
California’s announced target of an 80-percent 
reduction in greenhouse gases against 1990 
levels by 2050 is ambitious (California is the 
12th-largest emitter of greenhouse gases in 
the world), but achievable. Governor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger plans to wrestle greenhouse 
gases to the ground (and it won’t be thanks to 
rippling muscles or Hollywood special effects).
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 
2006 requires that the California Air Resources 
Board (CARB)
  Establish a statewide greenhouse gas 
emissions cap at 1990 emission levels by 
2020, based on 1990 emissions.
  Adopt mandatory reporting rules that con-
trol significant sources of greenhouse 
gases by January 1, 2009.
  Develop a plan by January 1, 2009, indicat-
ing how regulation, market mechanisms, 
and other actions will reduce emissions 
from significant greenhouse gas sources.
  Adopt regulations by January 1, 2011, to 
achieve the maximum technologically 
feasible and cost-effective reductions in 
greenhouse gas, including provisions for 
using both market mechanisms and alter-
native compliance mechanisms.
  Convene an Environmental Justice 
Advisory Committee and an Economic 
and Technology Advancement Advisory 
Committee to advise CARB.
  Notify the public and offer them an opportu-
nity to comment on all CARB actions.

165
 Chapter 10: Voting for Your Future: What Governments Can Do
England–Eastern Canada accord pushed for more energy-efficient lighting 
and public awareness programs, and it’s acting more quickly on greenhouse 
gas emission reductions than the federal government of either nation.
The Western Climate Initiative (which includes four Canadian provinces 
and seven U.S. states) works in a similar way. Their goal is to reduce green-
house gas emissions to 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. Although this 
initiative isn’t as strong as Kyoto or the reductions that California, Montana, 
Oregon, and Washington have already committed to, it nevertheless has 
three additional U.S. states (Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah) focusing on a 
reduced-carbon future. Its newest project is implementing a cap-and-trade 
system, which it plans to use with other carbon trading systems, such as that 
of the European Union and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
Countries
Many countries have shown that nations can reduce energy consumption 
while growing economically. The key is to improve efficiency, doing more 
with less — or doing it differently. In North America, regional governments 
are taking the big steps. On a national level, European countries are leading 
the industrialized world in going green:
 
 Denmark: Significantly increased its use of wind power, with 18 percent 
of its electricity coming from wind as of 2005.
 
 Germany: Met its Kyoto targets and now boasts a burgeoning export 
industry in wind turbines (as does Denmark).
 
 Switzerland: A world environmental leader for a long time. In recent 
years, the Alpine republic has undertaken a number of initiatives:
 
• Passing a federal law to cut methane emissions from waste
 
• Legislating a cut in carbon dioxide emissions from energy to 
10 percent below 1990 levels by 2010
 
• Implementing an energy program, SwissEnergy, that works with 
cities to set energy-efficiency standards for buildings, appli-
ances, and transportation, among other things (see the sidebar 
“SwissEnergy: How it works,” in this chapter)
 
• Providing EcoDrive courses that show people how to drive effi-
ciently (thus burning less gas and creating fewer emissions)
 
• Negotiating voluntary agreements for carbon dioxide reductions, 
which include tax exemptions

166
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally
The Swiss government has also taken a sustainable development approach to 
transportation. Thanks to Swiss government programs, major freight trucks 
have cut their annual road mileage by 6 percent while the freight volumes 
have increased. The money saved from this mileage reduction (over $1 tril-
lion per year) is put into railway infrastructure. And because of this boost in 
funding, train travel is predicted to grow at least 40 percent by the year 2030.
Switzerland also boasts numerous projects run by private organizations. 
The Climate Cent Fund, for instance, takes a one-cent levy on every liter 
(1/4 gallon) of gas that’s sold, and literally every penny from this levy goes 
into a fund for projects that directly reduce emissions in Switzerland and 
around the world.
 
Governments can’t solve the climate change challenge alone. Many other 
players — you, your neighborhood, businesses, and industries — all have 
to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (We talk about those 
other players in Part V.)
SwissEnergy: How it works
A program launched by Switzerland’s federal 
government, SwissEnergy describes its goals 
as “promoting energy efficiency and the use of 
renewable energy” to cut human carbon diox-
ide emissions. The program’s strength comes 
from the cooperative approach of four depart-
ments (transport, energy, environment, and 
communications), which work together with 
cities, industry, organizations, and businesses.
SwissEnergy has cut Switzerland’s consump-
tion of fossil fuels by 7.9 percent and electricity 
consumption by 4.7 percent. The use of renew-
able energies has increased, too.

G
enerally, when we discuss the effects that greenhouse gases have on 
the world’s atmosphere, we prefer the term climate change. Global 
warming simply isn’t an accurate description. But we do like one thing about 
this description: It reminds us that the problem we face isn’t just local or 
national, it’s global. Humanity is experiencing a global problem — and that 
problem requires a global solution.
The United Nations has a very important part to play in fighting climate 
change. It provides a forum for governments to work together and hammer 
out solutions to international problems. Global problem-solving is a long, 
slow process — and a thankless one much of the time. You may have read 
news articles about the countless international conferences on global warm-
ing and wondered what goes on at those meetings. Different nations bring 
competing agendas to the table; representatives from all nations must over-
come language and cultural barriers; and national governments face pres-
sures at home from business, organized labor, and opposition parties. The 
world’s glaciers may be receding faster than international agreements can 
move forward.
And yet, despite all the impediments, the world’s nations make progress. 
Even better, sometimes they enjoy huge successes, such as the international 
agreement to stop the destruction of the ozone layer (which we discuss in 
the sidebar “International agreements work: The Montreal Protocol,” in this 
chapter). Our world today is a safer place because of global agreements.

168
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
 
Global agreements hold countries accountable for certain actions and give 
nations a set of rules enforced through United Nations international law.
The world’s governments have been struggling with climate change for more 
than 20 years. The process has been painfully slow, and those governments 
still have a lot to do. But, right from the start, every country (well, almost 
every country) agreed that no one nation can solve the problem of climate 
change alone. In this chapter we go beyond the headlines you may read 
about these international agreements; we explore just why they’re so impor-
tant and what goes into making these agreements happen.
Why Global Agreements Are Important
Countries can do a lot to tackle global warming individually, as we discuss 
in Chapter 10. But the problem is far too great, and the solutions are far too 
complex, for countries to attempt to address climate change on their own. 
Each country is responsible for a portion of greenhouse gas emissions and 
has the ability to reduce global emissions anywhere from a fraction of a 
percentage up to 25 percent. But it is only with a collective effort that global 
emission can be reduced 50 to 80 percent. The world needs a global agree-
ment to reduce greenhouse emissions and fight climate change because such 
an agreement can
 
 Coordinate everyone’s efforts. A coordinated effort ensures that every-
one’s working toward the same goal, rather than charging off in all 
directions.
 
 Create an accepted target. Taking a big-picture approach allows nations 
to get a more accurate assessment of the actual impact of their emis-
sions. Countries can then work together to determine targets for reduc-
tion that can make a difference. (Check out the section “Looking at the 
Kyoto Protocol,” later in this chapter, to see how countries set their 
targets.)
 
 Ensure a level playing field. In this age of a globalized economy, 
countries’ government officials can feel terribly insecure, worried that 
businesses might leave them for a more accommodating nation. Some 
government officials might worry that imposing emission regulations 
would scare off industries; if all countries commit to reducing emissions, 
those government officials don’t have to worry as much. (We talk about 
regulating emissions in Chapter 10.)

169
 Chapter 11: Beyond Borders: Progress on a Global Level
 
 Include the developing nations. Because developing nations have lim-
ited financial resources, they can’t undertake initiatives for sustainable 
development or adaptation independently. A global agreement allows 
for wealthier nations to help these countries prepare for the effects of 
climate change and industrialize in a way that won’t contribute more 
greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. (Flip to Chapter 12 for more about 
the impact global warming has on developing nations.)
 
 Increase the transfer of technology and experience. When one country 
reduces emissions, it can share those best practices through interna-
tional systems set up within the Kyoto Protocol.
The United Nations creates a global sense of understanding, and it provides 
a structure and venue for countries to work on issues together. It’s the ideal 
arena for global agreements because it was designed for that very purpose. 
And it gets results. (See the sidebar “International agreements work: The 
Montreal Protocol” for an example of a successful global effort to reduce 
emissions.)
The United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change
The year 1992 saw the biggest gathering of heads of government ever held — 
the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, which drew together 170 countries and 
close to 20,000 people. Leaders rarely seen on the same stage, such as then-
U.S. President George H. W. Bush and Cuba’s then-president Fidel Castro, made 
first-of-their-kind commitments that continue to this day, on the topics of sus-
tainable development, biological diversity, and — of course — climate change.
The summit’s aim was to tackle climate change, so the leaders created the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). (In 
this case, a convention means a legally binding agreement — a statement of 
principles and objectives without specific numbers or measurable targets.) 
The Convention’s main goal is to stop the build-up of greenhouse gases in 
the atmosphere before the level of those gases becomes dangerous. (The 
Convention actually includes the word “dangerous” to describe the level of 
greenhouse gases that must be avoided.)
Of course, dangerous is a relative term. If you were in Europe during the 
heat wave of 2003 that killed 30,000 people, or fleeing the British Columbia 
forest fires of 2004, you might decide that climate change has already made 

170
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
the world pretty dangerous. In order to make the term dangerous a little 
less relative, the Convention parties (the participating countries) rely on the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). (We talk more about the 
IPCC in the section “The World’s Authority on Global Warming: The IPCC,” 
later in this chapter.)
The UNFCCC lays out the groundwork for action on climate change by
 
 Committing all parties to a shared commitment to action (committing 
to a commitment is sort of like giving your sweetheart a promise ring 
pledging that you’ll get engaged — you’re promising to make a promise).
 
 Acknowledging that climate change is occurring and that human activi-
ties, such as burning fossil fuels and changing land use (such as defores-
tation), are the major sources of this change.
 
 Accepting that if the parties wait for 100-percent scientific certainty, the 
problem will be too advanced to fix. The Convention adopts the precau-
tionary principle — that no party can use a lack of scientific certainty as 
an excuse for inaction.
Talking the global agreement talk
We talk a lot about conventions and proto-
cols. And you’ve probably read about other 
conventions, too — the Geneva Convention, 
for example, on the rights and treatment of 
prisoners of war. In diplomatic terms, these 
words have very specific meanings — quite 
different from how people normally use them. 
In this context, a convention basically involves 
agreeing to a principle — in this case, fighting 
climate change — and setting objectives, but 
with no timelines or specific targets.
As soon as all the countries’ government 
officials agree to the language of a conven-
tion, they normally sign it right away. Then, they 
take it back to their countries, where it must be 
ratified, or domestically approved. Ratification 
processes vary. In the United States, treaties 
must be subjected to a Senate vote where three 
quarters of the Senate must approve before the 
U.S. is bound by international law. In Canada 
and other parliamentary democracies, a treaty 
can be ratified by a simple Order in Council 
within Cabinet.
After a country ratifies a convention, that 
country becomes a party to that convention.
Conventions generally agree on a ratification 
formula — the number of countries that need to 
sign on before the convention is enacted (or, in 
U.N. language, enters into force) and becomes 
legally binding.
Later, parties can agree on a protocol, an 
agreement that’s stricter and more detailed 
than the original convention. Like a convention, 
it’s legally binding, but it contains actual dead-
lines and targets.

171
 Chapter 11: Beyond Borders: Progress on a Global Level
Establishing a game plan
The United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention doesn’t explic-
itly spell out how the parties involved should tackle climate change (that 
came later — we get into the Protocol that came from the UNFCCC in the 
section “Looking at the Kyoto Protocol,” later in this chapter). Instead, the 
convention committed the parties to “aim towards” stabilizing the level of 
GHGs in the atmosphere. It set out two areas in which the parties need to act:
 
 Adapting to climate change that can’t be avoided: The Convention 
acknowledges that, regardless of how much greenhouse gas levels 
drop, due to the increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human 
activity, the world can’t avoid some effects from climate change. All 
countries are going to have to adapt to a changing climate regime. Some 
countries may need to plant drought-resistant crops; others may need to 
build higher levees and dikes in low-lying areas, and not rebuild on flood 
plains. (We talk about adaptation in Chapter 10.)
 
 Reducing greenhouse gases: The Convention calls this process mitigating, 
which means cutting emissions.
Dividing up the parties
The UNFCCC recognizes that most human-caused greenhouse gas emissions 
stem from industrialized countries, and, therefore, it states that those nations 
should take the lead to battle climate change.
Countries vary in terms of how much they add to the problem and how able 
they are to actually help fix it. The UNFCCC breaks nations into three groups 
based on this variety, and it has different expectations for each group. In 
convention-speak, this division is called “common but differentiated respon-
sibilities and respective capabilities.” The following list describes how the 
groups are distinguished from one another:
 
 Annex 1 countries: This group includes all industrialized (developed) 
countries such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States. Annex 1 includes the following sub-groups:
 
• Economies in transition: This group is made up of countries that 
are transitioning to a market economy — primarily former Soviet 
countries such as Hungary, Belarus, and Poland.

172
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
 
• Annex 2 countries: The Annex 2 countries generally have the 
strongest economies — this grouping includes all Annex 1 coun-
tries, except for economies in transition. Parties of the UNFCCC 
expect these countries to contribute money, technology, and other 
resources to Non-Annex 1 countries.
 
 Non-Annex 1 countries: This group basically includes all industrializing 
(developing) countries, such as Brazil, China, and India. These poorer 
countries will have a much harder time adapting to the impacts of 
climate change than the wealthy industrialized countries in Annex 1 and 
Annex 2. They don’t have the money for new technologies or programs, 
and they often have far more immediately pressing issues to deal with, 
such as war, famine, HIV/AIDS, or inadequate clean water. (We look into 
the challenges facing developing countries in Chapter 12.)
 
Historically, the greater a country’s gross domestic product (GDP), the greater 
its volume of greenhouse gas emissions. Annex 1 (which includes Annex 2) 
countries face the most aggressive targets for emission reduction because 
industrialized countries produce the greatest amount of greenhouse gases.
Looking at the Kyoto Protocol
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
showed the world it was serious about tackling climate change when it 
met in Kyoto in 1997. At this meeting, called the Conference of the Parties 
(CoP), countries agreed on the Kyoto Protocol — a commitment to decrease 
greenhouse gas emissions by a set amount and before a set deadline. CoPs 
still continue to this day, with CoP 14 being held in Poland in winter of 2008.
United Nations negotiations are always tricky because they require agree-
ment by consensus — every party needs to be on board with the decision. 
Negotiations can go into the wee hours of the morning, often without a break. 
Bleary-eyed negotiators stay glued to their microphones while the translators 
share the discussions in six official languages.
In Kyoto, Japan, one set of negotiations went on for 36 hours straight. But in 
the end, the bad food, rumpled clothes, and sleep deprivation were worth it. 
Building on the Convention, negotiators agreed to the Kyoto Protocol.
Setting targets
National governments within the United Nations began discussing lowering 
greenhouse gas emissions way back in 1990 at the first meeting to set up the 
UNFCCC. And ever since, the conventions and protocols under the UNFCCC 
have used 1990 emission levels as the base for setting reduction targets.

173
 Chapter 11: Beyond Borders: Progress on a Global Level
Going into the negotiations at Kyoto, the European Union demanded a 
15-percent global reduction in greenhouse gases. The United States and 
Canada insisted on a much lower target. Ultimately, the parties settled on 
a global target for industrialized countries of 5.2 percent below 1990 global 
emission levels.
 
A global reduction of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels is actually a 24.2-percent 
reduction today, according to the World Bank, because of how much emissions 
have increased.
 
The Kyoto Protocol covers carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous 
oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur 
hexafluoride (SF6). (We cover these greenhouse gases in detail in Chapter 2.)
The countries that have binding targets for emission reductions are Annex 1 
countries to the Convention — but not all Annex 1 countries are part of the 
Kyoto Protocol. (The United States, for example, did not ratify the Protocol.)
International agreements work: 
The Montreal Protocol
In 1987, the United Nations Convention on 
Ozone met in Montreal, Canada, to negotiate a 
protocol to reduce the release of chemicals that 
were depleting the ozone layer — the layer of 
upper stratosphere that protects the Earth from 
the sun’s ultraviolet rays. Many industries used 
these ozone-depleting chemicals as refriger-
ants and the propellant in aerosols.
The Montreal Protocol, a globally ratified 
agreement within the United Nations, acknowl-
edged that industrialized countries had created 
most of the problem, that they had the best 
technology to solve the problem, and that poorer 
countries still needed access to chemicals so 
that they could economically develop.
The agreement required industrialized countries 
to cut production and use of ozone depleters by 
50 percent, and less-developed countries could 
increase their use by 10 percent. Ultimately, 
191 countries — almost every country in the 
world — agreed to get rid of ozone depleters 
altogether within a specified time frame. But 
the industrialized countries had to take the first 
step. The Kyoto Protocol takes a very similar, if 
not identical, approach.
The United Nations recently reported that 
ozone-depleting chemicals have been drasti-
cally reduced thanks to the Montreal Protocol. 
Recent studies show that the hole in the ozone 
layer has stopped growing and the layer is 
on its way to recovery. At the rate the hole is 
shrinking, the layer should be healed by 2050. 

174
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
The countries need to achieve the emission cuts outlined in the Kyoto 
Protocol between 2008 and 2012. The Kyoto Protocol refers to this five-year 
time frame as the first commitment period. Countries are negotiating another 
set of targets for the second commitment period. These negotiations are 
mandated to have a new phase of Kyoto negotiated by late 2009.
The European Union (EU) negotiated a collective goal of an 8-percent 
reduction below 1990 levels. Within the EU, countries with better economic 
potential and the capacity to cut emissions received higher reduction 
targets — such as Germany, which committed to a 21-percent cut, and 
the United Kingdom, which committed to a 12.5-percent cut (and they’ve 
already surpassed that target).
Ideally, the largest cuts in greenhouse gas emissions were applied to the big-
gest emitters, but this was not always the case: political will and popular sup-
port by country played a major role in assigning targets.
Table 11-1 shows the commitments that selected countries made to reducing 
their greenhouse gas emissions and how well those countries are meeting 
those targets.

 Chapter 11: Beyond Borders: Progress on a Global Level
Adding flexibility
Before agreeing to the Protocol, some industrialized countries insisted on a 
number of compromises called flexibility mechanisms (or loopholes, accord-
ing to many environmentalists). These mechanisms involve carbon credits. 
If a country lowers its emissions more than its target, it receives a carbon 
credit for the extra reduction. (It’s similar to what happens if you pay more 
than you owe on your credit card bill; you get a credit that goes toward your 
next bill.) The country can decide to either apply this credit to the next com-
mitment period (when it sets its second set of targets) or sell the credits to 
another country that’s having trouble meeting its targets now.
Because of the flexibility mechanisms, countries can actually make money if 
they lower their emissions more than they said they would. Of course, the 
downside of this trading is that some countries would prefer to buy credits, 
instead of actually reducing their own emissions. The good news is that the 
mechanisms convinced more countries to commit to the Kyoto Protocol.
The Protocol set out three specific flexibility mechanisms for Annex 1 
countries:
 
 Clean Development Mechanism: Annex 1 countries get credits for fund-
ing emission-reducing projects in developing countries. (See Chapter 12 
for more.)
 
 Emissions Trading: Countries that exceed their reduction targets can 
sell their extra reductions (carbon credit) to other countries. (We talk 
about how governments can implement emissions trading nationally in 
Chapter 10.)
 
 Joint Implementation: Former Soviet Union countries such as Ukraine 
and the Czech Republic (the Economies in Transition group — refer 
to the section, “The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change,” earlier in this chapter) can sell their credits to those Annex 1 
countries that have reduction targets. Annex 1 countries can also get 
credits for funding projects that reduce GHG emissions in former Soviet 
countries.

Emissions trading is the most controversial flexibility mechanism because it 
benefits one party almost exclusively. The USSR broke into smaller countries 
in the years that followed its collapse in 1991 — industry declined, and so 
did the emissions. But because Russia’s targets were based on its 1990 emis-
sions, it has already reduced emissions below its Kyoto targets and can sell 
its carbon credits — though it’s not actually reducing its current greenhouse 

176
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
gas emissions. Of course, Russia hasn’t always been just Russia. It, along 
with other countries that were part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
(USSR) (such as Ukraine and Belarus), has its own benchmarks, which repre-
sent a proportion of the old Soviet total. These other former Soviet countries 
also have credits to sell. No countries have purchased carbon credits from 
Russia (or other former Soviet countries) yet; industrialized countries con-
sider buying carbon credits from former Soviet countries an ineffective option 
because no actual greenhouse gas reductions are being made. The goal is to 
further reduce emissions, not pay for reductions from almost 20 years ago.
The Kyoto Protocol includes one other way participating countries can 
score carbon credits. Annex 1 countries can get credit for enhancing carbon 
sinks — those natural ecosystems (such as forests) that soak up carbon, 
keeping it out of the atmosphere. The Kyoto Protocol grants credits for 
undertaking afforestation (planting trees on previously treeless land) and 
reforestation (replanting on land that used to be forest). (Commercial logging 
can’t receive these credits — you can’t get credit for planting a forest after 
cutting one down!)
Opting out: The U.S.A.
The United States is a member to the UNFCCC, 
but it hasn’t ratified the Kyoto Protocol.
The United States accounted for 25 percent of 
global carbon dioxide emissions in 1990 (slightly 
less by 2004 — at 20 percent — because of 
China’s rising percentage). The U.S. signed 
the Protocol, meaning it set a target for itself, 
but the Kyoto Protocol was never forwarded 
from the president to the Senate for a vote, thus 
the U.S. never ratified the Protocol. In short, 
the federal government has not yet brought the 
Protocol into force nationally. The targets aren’t 
binding until a country ratifies them. The U.S. 
withdrew from the Kyoto process altogether 
in 2001.
President George W. Bush said he wouldn’t 
ratify Kyoto because it would hurt the U.S. 
economy. The U.S. also argued that the Kyoto 
Protocol is unfair to industrialized countries. 
Bush claimed that it puts major businesses and 
firms at a disadvantage because they’re bound 
by tough regulations but their competitors in 
developing nations aren’t.
Australia had signed the Protocol but didn’t 
ratify it until late in the game, even though its 
targets actually allow it to increase emissions 
by 8 percent above 1990 levels. Opponents of 
the Kyoto Protocol argued that ratification 
could damage Australia’s coal industry (the 
world’s largest), severely harming the country’s 
economy.
On November 24, 2007, Australia’s voters tossed 
out Prime Minister John Howard in favor of 
Kevin Rudd’s Labor Party. Rudd promised that, 
if elected, his government would ratify the 
Kyoto Protocol. On December 3, 2007, Australia 
became the latest nation to do so.

177
 Chapter 11: Beyond Borders: Progress on a Global Level
Ratifying Kyoto
For the Kyoto Protocol to become officially active, 55 countries had to ratify 
it, and those countries had to be responsible for at least 55 percent of the 
world’s greenhouse gas emissions in 1990. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto 
Protocol became legally binding.
When we wrote this book, 177 countries had ratified the Kyoto Protocol. 
This list now includes virtually every industrialized and developing coun-
try (including Brazil, China, and India). The notable exception is the United 
States — see the sidebar “Opting out: The U.S.A.,” in this chapter, for more 
about America’s position on the Kyoto Protocol. Only the countries that 
have ratified the Protocol can discuss issues and vote at the annual Kyoto 
Protocol meetings.
Of course, when national governments and their leaders change, countries 
might have a change of heart on the Kyoto Protocol. To un-ratify, a country 
has to wait three years from the date that the Protocol entered into force, 
and then it has to submit a notification of withdrawal, which is confirmed one 
year from the date received. (If the country withdraws from the Convention, 
it automatically withdraws from the Protocol.)
Negotiations take a long time, but humanity doesn’t have another way to 
solve complex global problems. Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change meet annually, and since the Kyoto Protocol 
Another agreement: 
The Asia Pacific Partnership (APP)
The Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean 
Development and Climate (APP) is a coalition 
of Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, the 
Republic of Korea, and the United States. The 
stated goal is to work together to develop and 
utilize new technologies that reduce air pollu-
tion, increase energy security, and sustain eco-
nomic growth.
Controversy surrounds the APP because 
many people say it was created to undermine 
the Kyoto Protocol. The APP has no emission 
reduction plans or targets. The Bush admin-
istration of the United States spearheaded 
this initiative to involve the fastest-growing 
economies in the world, but the partnership 
sets out no emission reduction targets or dead-
lines, both of which are essential to combat 
climate change. Critics have attacked the 
partnership for putting effort into a second 
agreement that covers the same issues as the 
Kyoto Protocol — reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.

178
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
came into force in 2005, Kyoto parties also meet annually. At the first meeting 
of parties to the Kyoto Protocol in 2005, the parties launched new negotia-
tions to establish the next round of reductions to begin in 2013, when the 
first commitment period ends.
The World’s Authority on Global 
Warming: The IPCC
Scientists around the world agree that global warming is happening due to 
human activity, but they don’t all agree what its local and specific conse-
quences will be. Thousands of studies are published every year that con-
sider every conceivable aspect of climate change. To keep track of the top 
research, the United Nations formed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) in 1988. The IPCC is a group that assesses current research 
and compiles it in reports that it issues every five years.
In November 2007, the Nobel Peace Prize was jointly awarded to the IPCC and 
Al Gore for their work on climate change.
Getting to know the IPCC
The IPCC is made up of 2,500 scientific expert reviewers from 130 coun-
tries. These reviewers (all volunteers) come from a wide range of scientific 
backgrounds and include 450 main authors and 800 assistant authors who 
work together to create the IPCC’s assessment reports. The governments of 
countries who are member parties of the UNFCCC can select scientists to be 
on the IPCC, often based on nominations from organizations or individuals. 
From these selections, the IPCC Bureau chooses their reviewers, picking can-
didates primarily based on scientific qualifications. However, other factors 
also come into play — the Bureau attempts to ensure that different regions, 
genders, ages, and scientific disciplines are all represented.
The IPCC’s assessment reports offer a big-picture look at the science about, 
causes of, impacts from, and solutions to climate change. The IPCC’s scien-
tists look at all the relevant peer-reviewed science in the world (meaning any 
scientific article reporting on recent research about climate change that a 
group of scientists, other than the writers themselves, approve) and inte-
grate this material into their report. The IPCC authors decide what to include 
by consensus, ensuring a broad and conservative agreement about what gets 
in. When disagreements occur, the IPCC notes them within the report.

179
 Chapter 11: Beyond Borders: Progress on a Global Level
Reading the reports
IPCC reports inform global talks about climate change. The IPCC published 
the first assessment report in 1990. This report played a key role in encourag-
ing the attendees of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to create the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992. (The 
section “The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,” 
earlier in this chapter, can tell you more about this Convention.) The second 
report, completed in 1995, helped spur the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. After 
the third report was issued in 2001, those awaiting a scientific authoritative 
statement couldn’t deny the man-made causes of climate change. The fourth 
report, issued in 2007, had a greater level of scientific certainty and further 
confirmed humanity’s role in climate change. That report began to give spe-
cifics about regional impacts.
The IPCC’s reports are heavy reading (literally — each report has about 
3,000 pages and weighs approximately the same as a newborn baby). With 
each report, the connection between climate change and human activity has 
become clearer — and the warnings about what will happen if people don’t 
act have become stronger.
The UNFCCC relies on the IPCC reports in their decision making. The reports 
recommend greenhouse gas reduction targets, regional adaptation strategies 
to climate change, and technological opportunities that can help reduce cli-
mate change. The reports’ top-end advice is trusted by UNFCCC parties.
The third report
The third IPCC assessment report was the first to state that there was only a 
5-percent chance that climate change was entirely natural. To put it another 
way, the IPCC was 95-percent certain that human activities were intensify-
ing natural climate change. This report showed that the greenhouse gases 
people were adding to the atmosphere helped cause major climate changes, 
more intense floods, droughts, storms, and water shortages. (Check out Part 
III for more about the effects of climate change.)
The third report was also the first to set a limit on greenhouse gas emis-
sions that the world shouldn’t exceed if it wants to avoid dangerous climate 
change impacts. (Flip to Chapter 3 for more information about working 
within this limit.)

180
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
The fourth report
The most recent report, the IPCC’s fourth, was released in 2007. In this 
report, the scientists offer a detailed estimate of how global warming will 
progress over time if greenhouse gas levels go unchecked. The report maps 
out what effects people will feel in what parts of the world. It also considers 
what impact various greenhouse gas reductions can have on the progress 
of climate change. Additionally, the report emphasizes the serious impact 
global warming will have on developing nations, analyzing how efforts to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change might affect 
those countries, and how sustainable development plays a role in responding 
to climate change in developing countries. (Most of the science that we dis-
cuss in this book comes directly from the fourth IPCC report.)
Reports for the rest of us!
The IPCC is constantly writing reports, in addi-
tion to the regular assessment reports, geared 
directly towards policymakers. They write these 
action-focused reports without using a bunch of 
science jargon, and anyone can access them.
These reports include
  Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage: 
Explains carbon capture and storage, what 
the costs are, how it affects the environ-
ment and people’s health, and barriers to 
implementing it.
  Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 
2007: Covers the scientific facts about 
climate change, considers the impacts cli-
mate change will have on people and the 
environment, and suggests how we might 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
  Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the 
Global Climate System: Explains how the 
ozone layer and climate are related, what 
gases cause holes in the ozone layer, and 
what kind of products give off these ozone-
depleting gases.
To find the main reports, visit www.ipcc.

T
he political climate surrounding global warming is incredibly unfair. 
Although the major contributors to global warming have historically 
been the richest, most industrialized nations, now that those nations are 
waking up to the dangers of global warming, they’re trying to hold developing 
nations to environmental standards that they themselves did not face. Worse 
still, these developing nations face the same environmental challenges as 
other countries, but without the financial resources to prepare for them.
This chapter investigates the unique challenges that these countries face 
while they seek to develop their economies in the face of global warming. We 
look at some positive steps that China, Brazil, and India (three of the world’s 
largest and most populous developing countries) are taking. Finally, we look 
at what initiatives developing countries can take to reduce their carbon emis-
sions and adapt to a warmer world, and how industrialized nations can help 
pitch in.
Growing Concerns
The countries of the world are roughly divided into two categories:
 
 Developed: These countries, which are also known as industrialized 
countries, have a strong industrial base and a relatively high income 
per capita. The generally accepted grouping of industrialized countries 

182
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
includes Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States, and 
all countries within Europe. Many people would also consider countries 
such as Russia and Israel to be developed.
 
 Developing: These countries generally have a low per-capita income 
and little industry. In developing countries, life expectancy is lower than 
in industrialized countries, and an increasingly urbanized population 
is growing more rapidly than the population in industrialized nations. 
All developing nations are moving toward industrialization (that’s why 
they’re described as developing), but some are closer than others. Most 
countries in the world are considered developing.

 Chapter 12: Developing in the Face of Global Warming
 
Some development academics argue that no country can ever truly be fully 
developed because progress has no real end. Others say that industrialization 
and a stable and strong economy signal that a country is developed. Another 
group thinks that development is defined by what educational and health ser-
vices are available to the general population.
Developing countries face significant challenges while they try to build and 
improve their countries’ economies. The route to wealth that all industrial-
ized countries followed (such as developing big industry by using fossil fuels 
such as coal and oil) leads to climate change. While the wealth and industry 
in these huge developing countries grow, so too does their energy consump-
tion. If these countries take their energy from the traditional sources that 
power industrialized countries, carbon emissions will skyrocket.
#

!
 
Consequently, the development of these countries is under great scrutiny. 
Some industrialized countries, such as the United States and Canada, have 
said that they won’t commit to reducing their impact on climate change unless 
major developing countries, such as China, Brazil, and India, also commit. But 
the “Do as I say, not as I do” position from major industrialized nations doesn’t 
sit too well with people in these countries. As Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio 
Lula da Silva told The New York Times, “We don’t accept the idea that the 
emerging nations are the ones who have to make sacrifices, because poverty 
itself is already a sacrifice.”
The generally accepted idea, which is the core of the Montreal and Kyoto 
Protocols (which we discuss in Chapter 11), maintains that industrialized 
countries caused the problem and have more resources to tackle it, so they 
should take the first steps in fixing it. After they get a good start, then develop-
ing countries can join in. The technological innovations of industrialized coun-
tries can help make the transition to a low-carbon development path more 
feasible, and the developing nations can focus on reducing emissions when 
they’re financially able to implement new technologies, including receiving 
financial and technological assistance from industrialized countries.
Promising Developments: 
China, Brazil, and India
China, Brazil, and India are three of the most heavily populated countries 
in the world: Their combined population is about 2.6 billion — close to 40 
percent of the world’s people. All three nations are generally considered 
developing countries. Yet each one is quickly moving toward industrialized 
status. Their development has led them down the same path that all other

Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
industrialized countries have traveled over the past 50 years — and industri-
alization, combined with growing populations, has led to massive increases 
in the amount of greenhouse gases they produce. China, Brazil, and India 
made up 22.2 percent of the world’s carbon emissions in 2004, and their emis-
sion rates have since grown. The rapid pace of industrialization in developing 
countries gives plenty of cause for concern.
However, together, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and 
Australia made up about 24.5 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emis-
sions in 2004. This group of industrialized countries comprises just 6 percent 
of the world’s population, which breaks down to an average of 21 metric tons 
of carbon dioxide per person per year. China, Brazil, and India collectively 
make up 40 percent of the world’s population, which breaks down to an aver-
age of 7 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person per year.
When trying to figure out who’s actually causing the carbon dioxide emis-
sions of a country such as China, consider that the industrialized world 
imports many of the goods that country manufactures. One glance at the 
label on your shirt or the fine print under your breakfast bowl may tell you 
that it was made in China. The government of Sweden has publicly recog-
nized that part of the industry emissions in China are growing simply to pro-
vide industrialized countries with things they want or need.
 
Although China, Brazil, and India don’t have to meet specific targets (yet), 
they (like all the countries involved in the UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol) have a general obligation to work to 
reduce emissions. Their governments understand that the climate crisis is 
real. (See Chapter 11 for more about the Kyoto Protocol.)
In the negotiations toward the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol (the first 
phase ends in 2012), these economic giants of the developing world are open-
ing the door to targets. So far, the discussions fall short of national targets, 
but developing countries could set targets for individual groups of carbon 
emitters, including a target for reductions in the electricity-generation sector 
of China, for example. (See Chapter 11 for more on the Kyoto Protocol.)
 
Although China, Brazil, and India may not have any specific targets under the 
Kyoto Protocol, they ratified the Protocol, which means that they’ve agreed 
in principle to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. (The Kyoto Protocol 
requires industrialized countries to take the first steps.) If these countries act 
on their commitments, the results could be tremendous: In fact, the World 
Bank and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) report that China, 
Brazil, and India could potentially cut their collective emissions by 25 per-
cent simply by using efficiency measures such as more efficient lighting, cool-
ing, and heating!

 Chapter 12: Developing in the Face of Global Warming
 
Advocates for climate protection definitely have high hopes for these devel-
oping countries. In fact, Brazil and China plan to make cuts in their emissions 
over the next five years that, taken together, will exceed the United States’ 
planned greenhouse gas reductions. The progressive work of these three 
countries — if it continues at this rate — is at the level needed to help the 
world level off greenhouse gas emissions in time to avoid irreversible changes.
China
China surpassed the United States as the world’s top polluter in the spring 
of 2007 — an event that many analysts thought would take at least another 
few years. Despite this dubious achievement, China is taking steps to 
improve its environmental record. The Centre for Clean Air Policy projects 
that China’s emissions in 2020 will be 7 percent lower than they would have 
been if they continued to pollute at previous levels had they continued with 
“business as usual.”
China may be improving its environmental citizenship in part because it 
bore the world’s scrutiny as host to the 2008 Olympics. China committed to 
greening their games in Beijing. They integrated energy-efficient design into 
all new venues, planted 580 new hectares of forest, and used technologies 
such as solar power to heat the swimming pools. The government also offset 
carbon dioxide emissions from the games by investing in projects in China 
and around the world.
Electric improvements
With its Renewable Energy Law and Energy Conservation Plan in place, China 
is cutting back on emissions. The Chinese government recently achieved a 
five-year goal of reducing greenhouse gases from electricity production by 5 
percent below their projected levels. This reduction had the same effect as 
shutting down more than 20 big coal-fired power plants. The government’s 
energy conservation plan also requires the nation’s top 1,000 polluting indus-
tries to become 20 percent more efficient by 2010.
China is also seeking to develop in a greener direction. The country has been 
using wind and solar power to provide electricity to remote villages across 
six regions. Because these areas are remote, it would be difficult to connect 
them to the power grid. The alternative? Go off the grid and be self-sustaining. 
This endeavor is part of a five-year project aimed at bringing electricity to 
40 million people out of the 132 million that don’t have electricity in China. 
These kinds of projects help build the quickly growing market of renewable 
energy technologies, making those technologies more accessible and afford-
able for everyone. (See Chapter 13 for more about renewable energy.)

Changes on wheels
The Chinese government is responding to the country’s changing transpor-
tation needs. Not long ago, a picture of a Chinese street showed a sea of 
bicycles. Everyone, it seemed, rode one. Today, that’s changing. The China 
Daily newspaper reports that Beijing, China’s acclaimed Bicycle Kingdom, 
now contains up to 2 million cars (although it still has 3 to 4 million bikes) 
because middle-class residents are changing how they get around.
To deal with this challenge, China’s government has implemented vehicle 
emission standards as part of a National Environmental Friendly Vehicles 
project that aims to cut emissions by 5 percent below what they otherwise 
would have been by 2020 — the most rigorous standards in the world. China 
also taxes cars based on the size of the engine, which means that SUV and 
truck drivers pay more for their less-efficient vehicles.
The challenges
 
Even with the steps in the right direction that we talk about in the preceding 
sections, the growth in greenhouse gases in China is a globally worrying trend. 
China’s carbon emissions increase like they’re bringing another coal-fired 
power plant into operation every ten days. The country continues to use coal 
and gasoline as its primary fuel sources — two fuels that produce the most 
greenhouse gas. Coal supplies 98 percent of China’s electricity use and 87 
percent of its heat energy, according to the International Energy Agency. The 
use of cars in China is also growing rapidly while people shift from bicycles to 
automobiles — car ownership has grown 500 percent over the past ten years.
Chinese economic goals are on a collision course with global environmental 
goals. With China adopting goals to end poverty, and with a growing middle 
class chomping at the bit to join the lifestyle that rich industrialized coun-
tries have created, its emissions are bound to increase unless it shifts its 
development in a climate-friendly direction. China faces a tough challenge: 
reducing emissions while becoming an industrialized country.
Brazil
Brazil is caught in a tight spot. On one hand, it has one of the richest ecosys-
tems in the world, the Amazon rainforest, with the Amazon River second in 
length only to the Nile. The Amazon works as a rain machine, feeding the vast 
farmland crops that supply food to countries around the world. On the other 
hand, cutting down the Amazon rainforest to provide land for agriculture 
is reducing rainfall and creating 75 percent of the country’s carbon dioxide 
emissions (from cutting down or burning trees).

187
 Chapter 12: Developing in the Face of Global Warming
The Brazilian government has programs in place to encourage the use of 
renewable energy and improve the efficiency of public transit. The govern-
ment has already committed to deriving 10 percent of the country’s electric-
ity from renewable sources by 2022.
Rain reforestation
You can trace the majority of Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions not to cars 
or industry, but to loss of forests. Tropical rainforests are the most effective 
of all forests at absorbing carbon (which we talk about in Chapter 3). In the 
state of São Paulo, for example, only 7 percent of the original forest remains. 
To deal with this loss of rainforest, Brazil’s national government and São 
Paulo’s state government are launching a massive reforestation project, one 
of the most ambitious reforestation projects in the world.
They don’t just plan to plant trees, they also want to rebuild the entire eco-
system: all the flora and fauna found in a rainforest (refer to Chapter 8 for 
more about ecosystems). Rebuilding an ecosystem is close to impossible, but 
this project can hopefully restore at least a part of the original rainforest.
Curitiba: A leader in public transportation
One of the keys to reducing greenhouse gases is 
getting people out of their cars and onto public 
transit. The Brazilian city of Curitiba is a leader 
in this area. The concept for that city’s system 
goes back to the early 1970s. The mayor was 
simply looking for a way to fix two problems — 
the poor couldn’t afford to ride the buses, and 
the buses needed more passengers. He started 
a transit voucher system for people who col-
lected recyclables (thus reducing litter) and 
instructed bus drivers to stop whenever some-
one waved, regardless of whether they were at 
a designated stop.
From this humble start, a much bigger dream 
emerged — to create a city that could integrate 
work, housing, and recreation to serve Curitiba’s 
quickly growing population. Within three years 
of its startup, the public transit system served 
a third of the city’s transportation needs. Over 
the years, the system has added buses and built 
subway lines, and the city has designed the 
system in a very efficient way — making sure 
that buses connect with subway stations and 
adding express bus lines.
Curitiba’s plan has been so successful because 
it defined from the start how transportation 
would work in the city and, more importantly, 
how the city would develop while it continued 
to grow. It’s one of the most substantial long-
term transit plans done by a city anywhere in 
the world.

Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
 
In a few decades, Brazilians plan to have replaced roughly 1 hectare of rain-
forest for every 6 hectares lost. This plan doesn’t offer a perfect result, but 
this reforestation is better than doing nothing at all. Community members are 
involved in reforesting their agricultural lands, making this plan a true grass-
roots initiative.
Miles ahead (on ethanol)
Brazil has become the world leader in producing sugarcane ethanol as part 
of its plan to wean the country off oil. Brazil originally focused on ethanol to 
lower the country’s dependence on foreign oil during the 1970 oil crisis — 
and it worked! Ethanol production has grown into a $65-billion business that 
makes up 40 percent of the fuel sold in Brazil, according to the Earth Policy 
Institute. A third of all sugarcane production in Brazil goes straight to pro-
ducing this fuel.
#
#?
!
 
Rumors often fly that ethanol production in Brazil is leading to more 
deforestation — but these rumors are exaggerated. Traditionally, Brazil’s 
sugarcane production has happened primarily in the southern region of the 
county, well away from the Amazonian rainforest. Increasingly, however, 
ecologists worry that the economic success of sugarcane ethanol may lead 
to sugarcane replacing rainforest in the northern Amazon.
Jose Goldemberg, a scientist and former Brazilian cabinet minister who has 
long advocated ethanol, believes that not every country can use ethanol 
as a solution to reducing fossil fuel dependency — he maintains that etha-
nol is only one of many pieces needed to solve the climate change puzzle. 
Goldemberg has said that if even 10 percent of cars in the world were to 
run on ethanol, it would require ten times the amount of ethanol that Brazil 
currently produces — an unlikely possibility. (See the sidebar “The man 
behind the success of ethanol in Brazil,” in this chapter, for the story of 
Goldemberg’s contribution to ethanol production.)
But heightened worldwide interest in ethanol makes Goldemberg certain 
that Brazil will boost production by 50 percent. In Brazil, the majority of cars 
on the road are flexible-fuel — they run on either gasoline or ethanol — and 
most people choose the more economical ethanol. The government’s ethanol 
program plans to cut emissions from transport by 18 percent below “business-
as-usual” trends by 2020, meaning that the emissions from transport will 
barely increase, even though more cars will be on the road. The bottom line: 
Sugarcane ethanol in Brazil has reduced carbon output by 9 million metric 
tons per year.

189
 Chapter 12: Developing in the Face of Global Warming
A cut below the rest
Deforestation is the biggest roadblock to reducing emissions for Brazil, 
accounting for 75 percent of the country’s annual carbon emissions. While 
commodity prices for crops go up, farmers want to plant more crops and 
clear more space for cattle — so, they often remove forests. Seventeen per-
cent of the original Amazonian rainforest has disappeared — an area larger 
than the size of France.
The rainforest of Brazil is large and difficult to manage — the trees cover an 
area the size of the whole western United States. No one claims ownership of 
much of the land, or people are disputing who owns it. So, the Brazilian gov-
ernment can’t easily regulate forest activities. Brazil, along with many other 
developing countries, has argued for including global assistance to stop ille-
gal logging and deforestation within the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol.
The man behind the success of ethanol in Brazil
These days, you frequently see ethanol mentioned 
in the news headlines. But Jose Goldemberg has 
had ethanol on his mind for over 30 years. He’s 
known as the man behind the global success and 
acceptance of ethanol as a replacement fuel for 
gasoline.
Brazil felt a heavy dose of oil shock back in 1975, 
so, to save its economy, it launched a major cam-
paign on alternative types of oil. Goldemberg 
was a nuclear physicist at the University of São 
Paulo at the time and published a paper in the 
journal Science three years after the oil shock. 
The topic? A message to the world that you can 
get ethanol from sugarcane — and that Brazil 
had created this clean and renewable alterna-
tive to conventional oil. His work provided the 
basis for today’s ethanol hype.
In 1988, Jose Goldemberg was one of the scien-
tists who attended the landmark first compre-
hensive international scientific conference on 
the threat of global warming. The conference, 
held in Toronto, was entitled “Our Changing 
Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security.” 
He assisted in drafting the consensus state-
ment and developing a target for reductions 
20 percent below 1988 levels as a first step by 
2005. He attended the UN’s 11th Conference of 
the Parties in Montreal in 2005, reporting on the 
agreement between the states of California and 
São Paulo.
Goldemberg has dedicated himself to energy 
issues his entire life. His academic work has 
led him to professorships at universities beyond 
Brazil — including Stanford, the University 
of Paris, and the University of Toronto. He 
published the acclaimed book Energy for a 
Sustainable World (Wiley) over ten years ago, 
and at the age of 79, he continues to work on 
developing policy to solve the world’s growing 
energy needs.

The rate of forest loss has been decreasing, dropping 50 percent between 2004 
and 2007. The Brazilian government has been working to designate protected 
forest areas. Thanks to these efforts, 38 percent of Legal Amazon (an area that 
contains all of Brazil’s territory in the Amazon basin) is now protected.
India
In terms of its carbon emissions, India is a sleeping giant. According to the 
World Bank, the country holds 16.9 percent of the world’s population but 
currently accounts for only 5 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. 
While the country becomes increasingly urbanized and industrialized, that 
number could skyrocket — but government agencies and organizations alike 
are taking the initiative to ensure that India doesn’t become a major polluter.
 
Since 2001, India has spent over 2 percent of its GDP (gross domestic product) 
on responding to climate change. India has also been the host country for a 
number of Clean Development Mechanism projects (we talk about these proj-
ects in the section “Choosing Sustainable Development,” later in this chapter), 
which have brought about a reduction of over 27 million metric tons of carbon 
dioxide.
Improving energy efficiency
The Indian government has been working hard at improving the efficiency of 
non-renewable power providers across the country for the past decade. For 
example, the government lowered coal subsidies. This loss of funding moti-
vated coal plants to increase their efficiency and even replace some of the 
coal with natural gas. The government plans to cut national greenhouse gas 
emissions from transportation and major industry to 12 percent below the 
projected business-as-usual levels by the year 2020.
Here are some other energy-efficient ventures that the Indian government 
has undertaken:
 
 Increasing emphasis on train transportation and shipping, which should 
boost the country’s overall fuel economy
 
 Converting 84,000 public cars and buses so that they run on compressed 
natural gas, rather than oil or diesel
 
 Improving the efficiency of wood stoves in 34 million homes, reduc-
ing the number of trees being cut down every year

191
 Chapter 12: Developing in the Face of Global Warming
Big business, big changes
Major businesses in India are getting involved in fighting global warming. And 
most big banks are coming on board by lending companies money to help 
cover the initial costs of energy-efficiency projects.
Some projects have shown an immediate payback:
 
 Apollo Tyres Ltd., a tire production company, invested $22,500 in redo-
ing their heating system, heating the building with the heat from the hot 
water system. With just a 14-month payback period, the company brings 
in an annual savings of $19,500.
 
 Arvind Mills Ltd., also in India, is the largest producer of denim jeans in 
the world. They connected their two main cooling pumps so that they 
could turn one off in the winter, a project that saves $280,000 a year — 
and the project cost them nothing.
A leader in renewable energy
India has become a leader in renewable energy (see Chapter 13). Renewable 
energy currently supplies 8 percent of the country’s total energy needs, and 
this number is growing. In fact, the country’s Electricity Act, enacted in 2003, 
stipulates that electricity providers in India must derive some part of their 
energy from renewable sources.
 
India has invested heavily in wind energy and is now among the top ten wind-
energy-producing countries in the world.
India also looks to another developing country for a profitable and carbon-
friendly venture. The world’s second-largest sugar producer after Brazil, 
India wants to follow in Brazil’s footsteps and start producing ethanol. In 
2003, India committed to shifting nine states to a gasoline blend that features 
5 percent ethanol, and some states and territories are now moving to 
10-percent blends. Though no one knows the exact emission reduction that 
this measure will create, this move can open up both the Indian and the 
global market and lower the production price of ethanol.
Growing by the numbers
India’s per capita emissions are very low — about one-twentieth of the United 
States’ and a tenth of Europe’s. Nevertheless, the country faces substantial 
pressures to reduce its emissions based on its large population and arguably 
unsustainable ways. Like China, India has a lot of coal. While India pursues 
economic prosperity, its growth in greenhouse gas emissions is a serious 
cause for global concern.

192
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
Choosing Sustainable Development
Although we can’t overstate the seriousness of poverty and the poor living 
conditions that many people in developing nations face, these countries do 
have a tremendous opportunity: Developing nations have the chance to steer 
clear of the mistakes of the industrialized nations and develop in a way that 
doesn’t harm the planet. Instead of building their nations’ economies on carbon-
dioxide-emitting fossil fuels, they can choose sustainable development.
What sustainable development means is open to debate. The Report of the 
World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future 
(also known as the Brundtland Report), which launched the term’s popular-
ity, used several definitions. Here are the general concepts:
 
 Development in both industrialized and developing countries that uses 
materials in an environmentally responsible way
 
 Development that doesn’t hurt the way that natural ecosystems func-
tion; doesn’t endanger species; and avoids air, water, and soil pollution
 
 Development that meets humanity’s needs without using so many 
resources or harming ecosystems to the extent that future generations 
won’t be able to meet their own needs
 
Climate change and sustainable development are linked. A nation needs a 
strong and balanced economy (an aspect also in peril because of climate 
change) to affect sustainable development. Sustainable development promotes
 
 Renewable sources of energy. These sustainable sources produce low or 
no emissions, so they don’t add to the climate change problem.
 
 The health and well-being of people, who may be in jeopardy because of 
the effects of climate change.
Old economies have sacrificed the environment to achieve economic 
growth. The newly developing countries have a chance to end this historical 
connection — to develop, but to do so with an eye for the climate change 
consequences and the incoming effects of climate change.
What developing countries can do
Global warming presents a two-fold challenge to developing countries. While 
they develop, they need to mitigate (or lessen) the production of greenhouse 
gases. Secondly, they need to adapt to the effects of global warming that 
they’re already feeling.

193
 Chapter 12: Developing in the Face of Global Warming
Mitigation
When it comes to mitigation, developing countries need to leap-frog — 
literally, skip over — the traditional fossil-fuel-based model that the older 
industrial economies followed and move straight into renewable energies to 
avoid boosting greenhouse gases. They have to choose new ways of generat-
ing energy, such as using solar, wind, low-flow tidal, and geo-thermal power, 
as well as bio-fuel. (We talk about these alternate energy sources in Chapter 
13.) Developing countries can’t always easily get these cleaner, renewable 
technologies, but the technologies have numerous benefits. Improvements in 
the energy sector also improve community health and general productivity, 
and boost the economy.
Clean energy can be costly, particularly for poor nations, so the Kyoto 
Protocol (a global climate change agreement) includes a program called 
the Clean Development Mechanism. (Refer to Chapter 11 for more about 
the Kyoto Protocol.) The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which the 
Brazilian government initially proposed, emerged from the last round of 
negotiations to create the Kyoto Protocol. In this program, developing and 
industrialized countries agree to work together, and the industrialized coun-
tries pay to build clean energy projects in the developing countries. (We talk 
about this program in the section “How industrialized countries can help,” 
later in this chapter.)
 
One example of a successful CDM project is in Honduras, where a power-
generating company collects the waste from a palm-oil mill. The company 
uses this plant-based waste as biogas to generate electricity. Before the 
company collected the waste, it sat in ponds while it decomposed and gave 
off methane. This project uses the waste, thereby reducing the methane 
emissions. Capturing the methane can reduce over 156,000 metric tons of 
greenhouse gas emissions each year, and the biogas energy can go straight 
into the grid to offset a total of over 37,000 metric tons of emissions in those 
same seven years that the palm oil waste decomposed in the ponds.
Adaptation
Although developing nations have the chance to avoid the mistakes made 
by industrialized countries, they can’t avoid the consequences of the mis-
takes already made. Developing nations have been feeling the effects of 
global warming for over a decade. The impacts of climate change are likely 
to worsen, so developing nations must adapt to prevent avoidable loss of life 
and property. (We discuss the disproportionate effects of climate change on 
developing countries in Chapter 9.)

194
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
 
Adaptation takes many forms:
 
 Shifting to more drought-resistant crops.
 
 Rethinking transportation infrastructure to locate bridges away from 
areas vulnerable to flash floods.
 
 Protecting and rehabilitating mangrove forests, which can help protect 
coastlines from increased storm surges.
 
 Moving vulnerable populations away from low-lying islands or coastal 
zones that may become flooded out of existence.
Some countries need to take all these measures — and more.
One major adaptation project that developing countries can undertake is 
planting trees in areas suffering from deforestation. Planting trees not only 
cools down the planet (a positive characteristic of trees and plants that we 
talk about in Chapter 2), it also enriches the soil with nutrients and helps 
reduce water runoff from flash floods. The soil on a treeless hillside washes 
away in a mudslide, but a tree-covered hillside’s soil stays put. The fewer nat-
ural disasters in a developing country, the less damage the local community 
and economy suffer.
 
Reforestation projects are taking place all over Brazil. A company doing the 
damage in the first place actually heads one of them! Performance Minerals 
& Pigments cuts down large strips of forest every year while they mine for a 
rare clay that’s used to make the glossy finish on paper. They’ve committed to 
reforesting the entire 10,000-hectare site that they’ve stripped.
Sadly, adapting to global warming also means preparing for the worst. 
Developing countries need safe water and food supplies to ensure that 
people have enough to survive if one of the extreme weather events — such 
as hurricanes and floods — wallops the developing world. To guard against 
those storms, governments need to build higher dikes and make stronger 
bridges. They need to make riverbanks and seasides capable of coping with 
deluges. They also need to make plans for a world with too little water; 
already, the World Bank is working with many other development agen-
cies around the world, such as its work with several Caribbean countries to 
develop drought-resistant crops, while helping Bangladesh plan ahead for 
serious loss of territory due to sea level rise.
Adaptation also means adjusting to whatever changes climate brings. Some 
communities may need to relocate if they can no longer sustain themselves. If 
a flood washes out a road or a hurricane levels a town, you shouldn’t rebuild 
in the same way or in the same locations.

195
 Chapter 12: Developing in the Face of Global Warming
How industrialized countries can help
Industrialized countries have two roles to play in helping developing coun-
tries adapt to climate change — as leaders and as partners.
Industrialized countries need to take the lead in clean technologies to show 
developing countries that the industrialized world is dedicated to cutting 
greenhouse gas emissions and that it recognizes its part in creating most of the 
emissions to date. (We talk about the actions that wealthy nations can take — 
both cutting emissions and adapting to climate change — in Chapter 11.)
Beyond developing and sharing low-carbon technologies, the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) says that industrialized 
countries need to partner with developing countries to help them cope with 
climate change. Industrialized countries have both the resources and the 
responsibility to work on these projects.
Aiding developing nations through 
the Clean Development Mechanism
The Clean Development Mechanism, or CDM (part of the Kyoto Protocol, 
which we talk about in Chapter 11), is one program that has developing and 
industrialized nations already working together to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. Through this program, industrialized countries fund greenhouse 
gas–reducing initiatives in the developing world. Smaller players usually 
implement the initiatives — a local renewable energy company, for example, 
or a municipality that has applied for support for the project.
Some industrialized countries become involved in CDM because of political 
will — the diligence to do what is right despite any barriers. Others, however, 
might invest in CDM projects to offset the weakness of their own climate 
change plan; investing in CDM projects increases a country’s carbon credits, 
which help the atmosphere in any event by reducing carbon emissions, even 
if from another country.
Endangered nations
In 1987, at the General Assembly of the United 
Nations, President Maumoon Abdul Gayoon 
of the Maldives warned that the world would 
soon have to use a new term. Humanity would 
talk about not just endangered species, but 
endangered nations. He urged that the world’s 
wealthiest nations act on global warming.
Ten years later, President Gayoon spoke at the 
United Nations to mark five years since the Rio 
Earth Summit, saying that the world had ignored 
the pleas of low-lying island states. As a result, 
the Maldives was forced to relocate villagers, 
as well as the population of an entire island, to 
higher ground.

196
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
 
The United Kingdom currently supports over a third of the CDM projects in the 
world. Japan and the Netherlands each support about a tenth of the projects.
One innovative feature of the CDM is that every CDM transaction includes a 
tiny tax. Every time a wealthy country invests in a poor country for a carbon-
reduction project, the trade includes a surcharge of 2 percent that goes to 
a fund for adaptation. This first global tax to fund adaptation is a step in the 
right direction, but it has nowhere near the resources that a proper global 
adaptation effort needs.
A similar financial mechanism is required to generate the tens of billions of 
dollars needed every year to fund adaptation in developing countries. This 
could be a tax, similar to that on CDM transactions, but for all exchanges of 
emission credits. Another mechanism of similar scale is also needed to allow 
developing countries to access clean energy technologies, allowing them to 
lift their citizens from poverty without following industrialized countries’ 
dirty path of development. Such mechanisms are being discussed as part of 
the UN negotiations for the agreement to follow Kyoto.
Planning on it
The world can no longer avoid some changes 
caused by global warming. So, all countries 
need to come up with a plan for how to deal 
with and adapt to climate change — a plan that 
countries actually use and update on a regular 
basis. While the climate changes, so must the 
plans and strategies of countries around the 
world.
Making adaptation plans for climate change, 
which is so diverse in its effects, means 
dedicated cooperation between government 
departments and across sectors of government, 
industry, business, and the public. Regular com-
munication between different regions helps 
coordinate the planning and enables the gov-
ernment to make adjustments to the plan based 
on successes and failures.
For developing countries, plans for adaptation 
must include stable funding. This funding can 
come directly from industrialized countries or 
from organizations funded by those countries — 
such as the Global Environment Fund (GEF). The 
GEF deals with a range of environmental issues, 
including climate change. It gives grants to proj-
ects in developing countries around the world. 
So far, they’ve dispersed $6.8 billion since 1991, 
helping over 1,900 projects.
Unfortunately, the world has made fewer mean-
ingful efforts on adaptation, particularly for the 
developing world, than its efforts to reduce 
greenhouse gases. “Too little, too late” is not 
the epitaph humanity wants! The world has to 
deal with climate change right now, and every 
nation needs to plan for today, tomorrow, and 
well into the future to literally live with the 
changes.

197
 Chapter 12: Developing in the Face of Global Warming
 
The UN has registered over 1,000 cooperative projects and expects that, by 
2012, all the projects will have reduced emissions by almost 3 billion metric 
tons. The bigger projects have produced reductions of over 10 million metric 
tons of carbon dioxide, with the smaller projects accounting for reductions of 
500 to 1,000 tons each year. Just a few of the big projects include the following 
partnerships:
 
 A private power plant in India and a private carbon-management firm in 
Switzerland are building a biomass-fired co-generation plant to power an 
industrial facility in Koorghalli Village in India (see Chapter 14 for infor-
mation about co-generation). The total emission reduction will be over 
1 million metric tons in the project’s seven-year period — reducing over 
36,000 metric tons every year (equivalent to taking 12 million cars off the 
road every year).
 
 A company from the Philippines has paired with a company in the 
United Kingdom to capture methane gas from landfills. The Montalban 
Landfill Methane Recovery and Power Generation Project, which uses 
the methane gas to create energy, will cut a total of 5.8 million metric 
tons of greenhouse gas emissions.
 
 The Netherlands and Sweden are partnering with wind-power-generation 
companies to increase the wind-power capacity of the Ningxia region of 
northern China, feeding that wind power into the electricity grid. This 
project is saving almost 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, 
not to mention providing employment opportunities and helping reduce 
poverty in the area.
Both the private sector and governments are developing more projects 
because interest is growing. While partnerships grow and companies build 
on experience, these projects in developing countries can improve and there-
fore have greater impacts.
Acknowledging an imbalance in Africa
#
#?
!
 
Clean Development Mechanism projects are concentrated in Central America, 
Brazil, China, and India. Very few CDM projects are underway in African coun-
tries for the following reasons:
 
 Africa is a relatively clean continent relative to the others, so it has 
fewer opportunities and reasons for industrialized countries to invest in 
projects there.
 
 Countries must have the people and the organizational capacity to 
support a project. Projects require government cooperation, and 
governments require the capacity to assist the projects. Additionally, 
the country’s infrastructure must be able to support the project. 
Unfortunately, many African countries lack these qualifications.

198
Part IV: Political Progress: Fighting Global Warming Nationally and Internationally 
 
 Investors look for low-risk projects — mainly in countries that have 
little political and economic instability. Many countries in Africa are less 
stable than countries such as India or China.
Nevertheless, the potential for low-carbon development strategies is very 
high for African nations. The Prime Minister of Ethiopia has said that he 
would love to see his nation become carbon-neutral. He lacks only the invest-
ment partners to make it happen.
The United Nations is trying to address the imbalance of more develop-
ment strategies in Latin America, China, and India versus Africa, but a gap 
still exists between these international development agencies and the com-
munities in developing countries who must ultimately adjust the balance 
themselves. Although the emission reduction projects that pose the biggest 
opportunity for CDM credits focus on lowering the emissions of a power 
plant or changing the source of electricity delivered to a community, African 
countries may find afforestation — planting trees where none grew before — 
a more accessible option.
 
While the Kyoto Protocol develops and improves, so can the CDM program. 
The UN negotiations created The Nairobi Framework in 2006, which is commit-
ted to helping bring more CDM projects to Africa.

an humanity actually avoid getting to the point of 
huge, devastating, and irreversible changes in the 
world’s climate? Of course! (Insert sigh of relief here.) A 
few conditions are already set in stone with Mother 
Nature, but people still have time to veer away from the 
most disastrous impacts.
This part is the most exciting because it’s packed with 
solutions. We look at renewable energy sources, such as 
wind and solar power, and consider what industry can do 
to become climate friendly. Another important solution 
involves spreading the word about global warming, and 
keeping businesses and governments informed about the 
problem, so we fill you in about what non-governmental 
organizations are doing and how you can get involved. We 
also offer information about how to stay on top of media 
reporting about global warming. Finally, we fill you in on 
what you can do to reduce your own carbon footprint, 
whether you’re traveling, at home, or at work.

itizens around the world rely on oil and other fossil fuels as their major 
source of energy, but times are changing. Oil — at least cheap, acces-
sible, and conventional oil — isn’t as abundant or secure as it used to be. 
Global warming has awoken people to the dangerous greenhouse gas emis-
sions that burning fossil fuels produces. Humanity needs to change the way it 
uses energy and where it obtains that energy.
Renewable energy is a secure energy source, helps reduce the use of fossil 
fuels, and gives people a real option for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. 
In the next 25 years, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that 
the global use of wind, solar, geothermal, and hydroelectric power will 
continue to grow. But it acknowledges that although renewable energy can 
entirely replace fossil fuels, it likely won’t within the next 50 years. Others, 
such as Dr. Hermann Scheer, architect of Germany’s Renewable Sources Act 
and the leading proponent for the creation of a United Nations–sanctioned 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), argue that not only is a sig-
nificant shift towards 100 percent renewable energy possible, but it is abso-
lutely necessary.
In this chapter, we look at how the world’s use of oil and other fossil fuels 
needs to change, and we explore the opportunities for renewable energy.
Changing the Way Civilization Uses Oil
Changing habits and technology is no easy feat, but it’s something everyone 
will be doing in the coming years. The world, especially industrialized coun-
tries, has begun to think about oil as a precious resource that must be man-
aged carefully and used frugally.

202
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
Becoming conservative with oil use is important because demand is about to 
surge: The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects world energy demand to 
rise more than 50 percent in the next 20 years due to rapid industrialization in 
developing countries.
Prioritizing and conserving fossil fuel use
Because modern civilization’s love affair with oil has a time limit, people 
need to make that relationship last — and to make a few compromises along 
the way. Humanity needs to start using oil only where it’s really needed and 
replacing it with alternatives where they exist.
The economic activities for which only petroleum products can meet current 
needs lie largely outside the energy field. Petrochemical production includes 
everything from plastics and nylons, synthetic fabrics, and a host of con-
sumer products. Burning petroleum, with its many other uses and its limited 
supply, is hardly the most sensible approach.
The modern world now needs to play the field and add other energy sources 
into the mix where fossil fuels can be reduced or replaced. You may have 
already seen gas that’s been blended with ethanol or diesel that’s been com-
bined with biodiesel at the pumps. Because these fuels use up to 25 percent 
less gasoline and 10 percent less diesel, respectively, you can help conserve 
fossil fuels by using them. (We discuss these fuel alternatives in the section 
“Investigating Renewable Energy Options,” later in this chapter.)
In some instances, people can side-step the use of fossil fuels completely. 
Alternative forms of car fuel and energy to power buildings and industry have 
been around for a long time — ranging from electric cars to renewable energy 
sources. Even some alternatives to consumer goods are readily available. 
Plastics can be made from corn oil. Fleece and other synthetic materials can 
be made from recycled plastic bottles. Other alternatives are in the planning 
stages: One example involves a possible solar-powered airplane — the sky’s 
the limit!
Combining heat and power
When oil, gas, or coal is burned to generate electricity, only about one-third 
of the energy actually generates any power. The other two-thirds is wasted. 
A lot of it goes up the chimney. (This type of energy waste is more common 
than you might think. With regular light bulbs, only 10 percent of the energy 
creates light — the other 90 percent is lost as heat!)

203
 Chapter 13: A Whole New World of Energy
This lost energy doesn’t have to go up in smoke; it can be used for co-generation, 
producing both heat and electricity at the same time. Co-generation takes the 
same amount of fuel, but it captures the heat that would be lost otherwise and 
uses it to heat a building. COGEN Europe reports that co-generation systems 
capture about 90 percent of the energy this way, with only a scant 10 percent 
being wasted. New York City’s Consolidated Edison utility uses the steam from 
seven steam generating plants to provide heat to 1,800 commercial customers, 
who use it to warm 100,000 buildings.
Co-generation technology can also be used with renewable power plants that 
use biomass (like forest waste) or biogas (produced by using bacteria to 
eat up cow manure and food wastes) and can be supplemented by solar hot 
water heaters that pre-heat the water used to produce steam in the genera-
tors, meaning fewer fossil fuels (or bio-fuels) need to be used.
Figure 13-1 shows a co-generation system that uses turbines to reuse energy 
from pressurized blast furnace gas.

Part V: Solving the Problem 
Using oil efficiently
When no current option exists besides using fossil fuels, people can at least 
ensure that they use it efficiently, squeezing as much energy out of it as pos-
sible. Companies are working to develop high-efficiency technologies. For 
example, the compact fluorescent light bulb, which lasts ten times longer 
than a regular light bulb and uses a quarter of the energy, has already found 
its way into many homes. (Although these bulbs use electricity, fossil fuels 
often generate that electricity; refer to Chapter 4 for more on how people use 
fossil fuels.)
Just about anything — whether it’s a whole office building, an entire fleet of 
cars, or a total manufacturing system — can be made more efficient. People 
often use four to ten times more energy than they need, according to the 
European Renewable Energy Council. It doesn’t make sense, for example, to 
use oil or grow fields upon fields of corn for ethanol when someone could 
simply redesign cars so that they use ten times less fuel to begin with.
 
Civilization was improving its efficient use of energy at a rapid rate until 1990. 
Since then, that progress has fallen off; the International Energy Agency (IEA) 
reports that energy efficiency has been improving at only half its previous 
rate. Humanity needs to get back on track and double its rate of energy-
efficiency improvement if it wants to make a significant difference in the fight 
against global warming.
 
Technology hasn’t yet hit its efficiency peak. The IEA says that a lot of room 
still exists for development and improvement of high-efficiency measures in 
industrialized countries, especially in the major sectors: buildings, industry, 
and transportation.
Changing How to Handle 
Fossil Fuel’s Emissions
Even if civilization uses fewer fossil fuels and improves how efficiently it uses 
it, fossil fuels will still produce greenhouse gases when burned. Currently, 
those gases are released into the atmosphere, but oil companies and 
researchers are exploring an alternative.

205
 Chapter 13: A Whole New World of Energy
Capturing and storing carbon dioxide
Oil companies and researchers are conducting major tests dealing with the 
capture and underground storage of greenhouse gases. Storing the carbon 
works differently in different places. Two ways of capturing and storing 
carbon are currently being used:
 
 During oil production: Oil-product producers pump the carbon diox-
ide into the ground at the same time that they pump the oil out of the 
ground. The pressure from the gas being pumped in actually helps to 
get the oil out more efficiently — creating a controversy over whether 
this use of the technology actually benefits the climate. (See the sidebar 
“Carbon capture controversy,” in this chapter, for more information.)
 
 Dealing with industrial emissions: Major carbon dioxide emitters, such 
as coal power plants, capture the gas by containing the source of the 
emissions and directing the gas underground. This process stores the 
carbon dioxide in places from which people once extracted oil; in big, 
empty spaces underground; or into unmineable coal beds and saltwater 
aquifers. This need for storage-space limits the widespread use of this 
technology.
What’s a fossil fuel company to do?
Oil companies face huge opportunities. Consider 
British Petroleum (BP), which now markets itself 
as Beyond Petroleum. Responding to climate 
change, BP has taken social and environmental 
leadership to minimize its emissions and over-
all environmental impact. These changes were 
sparked under the leadership of former Chief 
Executive Lord John Brown. What was once 
strictly a petroleum business has morphed into 
an energy business that raises public aware-
ness about climate change and big technology 
solutions.
BP still deals with petroleum, but it also takes a 
lead in developing low-carbon fuels and tech-
nology. The company
  Launched an alternative energy business 
in 2005
  Launched a bio-fuels business in 2006
  Invested $520 million in projects research-
ing low-carbon technologies, clean energy, 
energy policy, and urban energy solutions
  Is involved in developing carbon capture 
and storage technology
  Is dedicated to raising public awareness 
through advertising and Web site features
Fossil-fuel companies have the potential 
to become energy companies, expand their 
customer base, and ensure that they remain 
successful through policy and cultural changes 
designed to help reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions.

206
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Figure 13-2 shows how both of these methods work.

An area’s geology is a huge factor in determining whether or not carbon cap-
ture and storage will work there. In Norway, for example, the technology is 
being applied by pumping carbon dioxide down under the deep sea. But what 
works in the North Sea geologically may not work elsewhere.
People can’t capture all carbon dioxide emissions. Catching the emissions 
coming out of a stationary smoke stack is much easier than capturing the 
carbon blowing out of the tailpipe of a moving car. Over half of the carbon 
dioxide that can be captured is emitted by coal power plants; the remainder 
is from major industrial emissions.

207
 Chapter 13: A Whole New World of Energy
Considering carbon capture cons
Carbon dioxide capture and storage is a temporary solution because 
the available storage space is limited. (This storage space could also be 
employed for other, greener uses including the storage of natural gas and the 
compression of air as a means to store excess energy that can be released 
when necessary to turn turbines.) Whether people can pipe carbon dioxide 
back underground, down the now-empty oil wells, depends on the kind of 
geology near the pollution source. According to the International Energy 
Agency (IEA), the planet has enough room underground to store tens to hun-
dreds of years’ worth of carbon dioxide emissions (no one knows just how 
much room exists, hence the wide time range).

Some environmental groups have major concerns about carbon capture and 
storage, arguing that it
 
 Allows civilization to keep using fossil fuels, rather than replacing them 
with carbon-friendly alternatives.
 
 Enables oil producers to extract more oil, ultimately creating more 
carbon dioxide emissions (see the sidebar “Carbon capture contro-
versy,” in this chapter, for more).
 
 Isn’t foolproof. The stored carbon dioxide has the potential to leak out 
of storage and escape into the atmosphere, thus warming the atmo-
sphere. Additionally, the escaped carbon dioxide, which is odorless, 
colorless, and poisonous, could collect in hollows, posing a threat to 
animal and human life.
Despite challenges and concerns, the IEA predicts that carbon capture and 
storage could be ready for major use in industrialized countries by 2015 and 
play a huge role in reducing worldwide greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 
Carbon capture controversy
In Canada, the Weyburn Saskatchewan Project 
is capturing the emissions from the Great Plains 
plant in Beula, North Dakota. The carbon diox-
ide emissions are transported through a 202-
mile (325-km) pipeline and stored in old oil fields 
at Weyburn.
This project plans to store up to 20 million metric 
tons of carbon dioxide — while producing 
another 130 million barrels of oil. Some argue 
that they wouldn’t be able to access that much 
oil without the carbon dioxide; so, the entire 
process may ultimately produce more carbon 
dioxide than if none had been captured at all.

208
Part V: Solving the Problem 
This technology is still expensive, but its costs could come down by half or 
more if initiatives such as the carbon market are implemented. (See Chapter 
10 for more on the carbon market.)
 
The cost of carbon capture and storage isn’t cut and dried — it depends on 
factors such as how far the carbon dioxide has to be transported for storage 
and what kind of technology is used to store it. The estimates for capturing 
the gas range from $5 to $115 per metric ton of carbon dioxide — depending 
on what technology is used. Transporting the gas can cost $1 to $8 per metric 
ton. Storing it can cost 50¢ to $8 for under the ground, and $5 to $30 for under 
the ocean floor (the ocean-floor storage costs more because carbon-storing 
companies have to transport the gas about another 60 to 300 miles — roughly 
100 to 500 km — offshore).
Investigating Renewable Energy Options
The threat of climate change has encouraged individuals, governments, and 
businesses to consider sustainable energy sources that have low greenhouse 
gas emission rates, rather than exhaustible fossil fuel resources. Sustainable, 
or renewable, energy sources — such as plants, the wind, and the sun — 
regenerate themselves or can be replenished. Once up and working, most 
of these energy sources produce zero or little greenhouse gas — the only 
emissions from wind and solar power, for example, could come from the 
manufacturing of the turbines and panels, not from the actual production of 
electricity.
 
None of these sources can supply all the world’s energy needs on its own, but 
collectively, renewables can replace fossil fuels. The primary barrier has been 
the cost of renewables versus fossil fuels. The solution lies in choosing which 
energy source is right for a particular region. For a secure and sustainable 
future, humanity needs a range of energy sources, making civilization’s energy 
systems less vulnerable to changes — like having a bunch of backup systems.
 
Renewable energy is already used around the world. Renewable sources make 
up 4.9 percent of the energy produced in Australia, 3.8 percent of Canada’s 
energy, 0.6 of the United Kingdom’s, and 3.9 of the United States’. The global 
average is a bit lower, at 3.5 percent. Those figures are much higher if you 
include large-scale hydroelectric systems, such as northern Quebec’s James 
Bay facilities. (The percentages that include hydroelectric power are 5.5, 16.1, 
2.0, and 4.7, respectively.)

209
 Chapter 13: A Whole New World of Energy
Calling hydroelectric systems “renewable” is controversial because water 
may not always flow where it does now. Calling these projects “sustainable” 
also draws some controversy because they can permanently inundate thou-
sands of square miles of territory for enormous reservoirs.
Blowin’ in the wind
With the power to uproot trees, tear apart homes, and transport Dorothy to 
Oz, the wind is a natural force to be reckoned with. Humans can harness that 
power to generate energy through overgrown pinwheels, known as wind tur-
bines. A wind turbine typically features a propeller that has three blades on a 
hub that sits atop a tall pole. When the wind blows, the blades of the propel-
ler spin, capturing the wind’s power and transforming it into electricity or 
mechanical energy. Together, multiple turbines are called a wind farm. Figure 
13-3 shows a wind farm.

Worldwide, the wind-power industry has been growing at 23 percent a year 
since the early 1970s. And, while the industry grows, wind power technology 
has become more reliable and cheaper.

210
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Three countries boast two-thirds of the world’s active wind power: Denmark, 
Germany, and Spain. Denmark has long been the leader in wind power devel-
opment, with 18 percent of its energy coming from wind in 2005, according 
to the IEA. Wind energy has a significant upside: It produces zero emissions. 
The IEA expects that building up the wind industry can help make huge 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
Unfortunately, a few barriers prevent the widespread implementation of wind 
technology:
 
 Costly to connect: Good sites for wind power are often far from trans-
mission lines, and installing new lines is difficult and costly. Some wind 
farms are now generating hydrogen, which can be delivered along the 
same kind of systems used for natural gas.
 
 No storage: Currently, wind power can’t be stored effectively, so it’s 
available only when the wind blows. Countries like the Netherlands, 
Germany, and Spain are beginning to utilize different forms of storage 
such as compressed air, pumped storage (taking water to the top of a 
hill to use later), and even hydrogen production.
 
 Public opposition: Public acceptance can still be low, depending on 
where builders place the wind farms. People don’t often want to have 
wind farms in their communities because they think those farms are 
unsightly. Wind farms also produce low-level frequencies that some 
people find unpleasant. Finally, some people worry that wind farms 
endanger birds. (For more, see the sidebar “A big flap over wind power,” 
in this chapter.)
A big flap over wind power
One of the biggest complaints against wind tur-
bines is that they kill birds. Initially, this threat 
was a serious problem because builders didn’t 
take bird and bat migration routes into consid-
eration when erecting the turbines. A report put 
out by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences 
says that for every 30 wind turbines, one bird is 
killed each year, although these numbers are 
contested. Based on these numbers, 40,000 
birds die because of wind turbines each year 
in the U.S. alone.
While wind energy moves forward, wind turbine 
developers and companies are taking concerns 
for bird safety into account. They usually build 
turbines away from migration routes and often 
add colored markings to the blades to ensure 
that our feathered friends can see them. 
Ultimately, wind turbines are far from a bird’s 
worst enemy, making up just 0.003 percent of 
human-caused bird deaths in the U.S.

211
 Chapter 13: A Whole New World of Energy
Here comes the sun
Solar energy is very efficient and, like wind power, it produces no green-
house gases. You can capture solar energy, even on cloudy days. And it’s the 
most abundant type of energy available — far beyond civilization’s needs. In 
fact, the World Energy Council reports that the amount of solar energy that 
reaches the earth is over 7,500 times that of civilization’s current energy 
demand! Even if society only captured 0.1 percent of the sun’s energy, and 
used it with just 10 percent efficiency, it could still meet its current energy 
demand four times over.
The downside, which many renewable energy sources share, is the high 
upfront cost of setting up new technologies to capture that energy. 
Presently, solar electricity generation is the most expensive form of renew-
able generation (while solar thermal energy for producing hot water is one 
of the cheapest). Oil and coal offer far cheaper alternatives, but at a great 
environmental cost. Meanwhile, fossil fuel prices are going up, while solar 
costs are dropping.
People can harness solar energy in three ways, each of which we investigate 
in the following sections.
Photovoltaic energy
When people think of solar power, they probably think of photovoltaic power 
sources, which use solar cells to convert sunlight into electricity (photo 
means light, and voltaic means voltage). You can use these solar cells on 
their own — to power things such as calculators, satellites, or flashing elec-
tric construction signs — or as a part of a power grid, in which they contrib-
ute to an area’s energy source.
One of the most common ways to use this type of solar energy is on roofs — 
using solar panels, solar shingles, solar tiles, or even solar glazing on skylight 
windows. You can have them designed for any size building with varying 
energy needs. When Bill Clinton was president of the U.S., he set a goal of a 
“Million Solar Roofs.” This effort helped the photovoltaic industry get off the 
ground in that country.
The one drawback to photovoltaic power sources is that the typical solar 
cell is relatively inefficient. For it to work at its best, it generally needs direct 
sunlight — though it does still work on cloudy days. Fortunately, solar energy 
developers are continually working to improve this efficiency.
While the use of photovoltaic power spreads, the price comes down. Japan, 
Germany, and the U.S. lead the world in widespread solar cell use. Some solar 
companies are now boasting that their sun-made electricity can cost-compete 
with coal.

212
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Solar photovoltaic energy tends to produce the most power when the 
demand is highest (on hot days in the summer when people pump up their 
air conditioning). Because electricity demand is higher at these peak times, 
the price of electricity is very high, making solar power very competitive and 
useful — especially if it’s being produced close to where it’s being used (like 
on your roof) so that as little precious power is wasted as possible (trans-
porting power over the lines uses up power).
Passive solar energy
You can use the sun as an energy source, even without special technology, 
simply by using its direct heat and light. This type of solar energy is called 
passive solar energy because you don’t need to physically transform the 
energy to use it. For example, the heat from the sun coming through your 
kitchen window warms up the room. (Cats are famous for taking advantage of 
passive solar energy.)
This technique works because it follows the sun. The sun rises in the east 
and sets in the west. It is also higher in the sky in the summer, and lower 
in the winter. Using passive solar energy means shading yourself from the 
summer sun, and bringing in the warmth of the winter sun.
For example, to take advantage of passive solar energy in your home, you can 
install most of your windows so they face south (north if you’re in the south-
ern hemisphere) and fully insulate the opposite side of the house. You can 
also put your most-used rooms, such as the kitchen and living room, on the 
south side of the house and put your bedrooms on the opposite side. With 
this kind of house design, the sun’s warmth heats and lights the kitchen and 
living room during the day. This warmth eventually heats the whole house. 
At night, your well-insulated bedrooms keep in the heat that built up over the 
day. In the summer, the sun’s rays from above will hit the roof, and not the 
windows, keeping your home cool in the summer.
What’s a watt?
Power is measured in watts (W), named after 
steam-engine inventor James Watt. It refers 
to an amount of energy consumed at a point 
in time. Lifting an apple off the table takes one 
watt.
You probably know the term “watts” from 
buying light bulbs of 60 W or 100 W. When a 
100-watt bulb is on for ten hours, it uses 1,000 
“watt-hours” (the 100 watts of power it draws 
multiplied by the ten hours it’s on). This amount 
of energy is more commonly called one kilo-
watt-hour or kWh. The electricity for your 
home is normally billed by the kilowatt-hour. 
Depending on how energy-efficient your fridge 
is, running it for a year uses 400 to over 900 kWh 
of electricity.

213
 Chapter 13: A Whole New World of Energy
Solar thermal energy
Solar thermal energy is sort of a combination of photovoltaic and passive 
solar energy: It uses panels that have water or glycol (an antifreeze-type 
liquid) running through them to capture the heat from the sun. You can use 
this heat for different purposes, depending on the solar thermal system.
The most common use for solar thermal energy is to heat things such as 
swimming pools (by using low-temperature collectors) and residential hot 
water tanks (by using medium-temperature collectors). Medium-temperature 
solar thermal energy collectors can heat more than water, however; they can 
even heat large commercial or industrial buildings. Take a look at Figure 13-4 
to see how solar thermal energy works.
 
Figure 13-4: 
Solar ther-
mal energy 
in action.

You need other means of energy to heat water — solar heat can’t do it all. 
Depending on how sunny it is and how much hot water you use, solar hot 
water heaters can supply, on average, 60 percent of the heat you need for 
your hot water, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 
Surprisingly, 50 percent of homes in the U.S. and 67 percent of commercial 
properties are in locations with sufficient sunlight to use solar thermal 
energy.
China, Taiwan, Europe, and Japan use the majority of solar thermal energy, 
and they use it for hot water and space heating. In Canada and the U.S., the 
technology is mostly used to heat swimming pools, though more homeown-
ers are getting on board (especially when they find out they can pay the 
system off in five or six years if they have a family of four or more).

214
Part V: Solving the Problem 
You can also use solar thermal energy to produce electricity. High-
temperature collectors, which take the form of multiple mirrors, concentrate 
sunlight and focus that energy on a small area. The resulting heat can pro-
duce steam from water, which you can use to generate power.
Heat from the ground up
You know the Earth is heating up — that’s why you’re reading this book. 
But beneath the Earth, it’s already hot. Geothermal power derives from 
the heat beneath the Earth’s crust. (Geo literally means Earth, and thermal 
means heat.)
People can harness geothermal energy through water (or an antifreeze-type 
liquid) that they pipe underground. That water boils because of the heat 
from magma (what volcano lava is before it reaches the surface) deep inside 
the Earth. Magma is incredibly hot — around 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 
degrees Celsius). The pressure from the steam from the boiled water drives 
itself through installed pipes back up to the surface and propels a turbine, 
which creates electricity. The pipes then return the water underground to 
repeat the cycle.
Some hot spots are more readily accessible than others. The closer a hot 
spot is to the surface, the easier it is to access. Also, the easier it is to get 
through the ground, the better chance you have of accessing a hot spot. 
The United States has the most geothermal resources, with Latin America, 
Indonesia, the Philippines, and East Africa also well endowed. Geothermal 
energy plants exist on every continent in the world.
Even in areas that do not have access to “hot spots,” geothermal is a growing 
energy source. Water can be warmed sufficiently using a heat exchanger (like 
a refrigerator in reverse) to heat a house by pumping an antifreeze-like liquid 
through a closed loop underground (a loop of pipes buried in your back 
yard or under a parking lot). A simple geothermal heat pump can be located 
nearly anywhere on earth. This form of geothermal energy does not make 
electricity, but it can replace a fossil fuel furnace.
 
About 19 percent of Iceland’s electricity comes from geothermal energy. The 
country has 600 underground hot springs that it can tap into, enough to fuel 
all of Iceland’s electricity. The water itself heats about 90 percent of homes 
in Iceland and provides all the hot water. Geothermal utilities use the same 
source to create the many bathing pool hot springs in the country. Iceland has 
been shifting its electricity technology from oil to geothermal ever since the 
oil crisis in the 1970s — they’ve invested about $8 billion over the past three 
decades, and they’ve become almost entirely self-sufficient. The Philippines 

215
 Chapter 13: A Whole New World of Energy
are close behind Iceland, generating over 17 percent of their electricity from 
geothermal energy.
The IEA estimates that the world offers a potential of 85 gigawatts of geother-
mal energy (a gigawatt is 1 million watts), which is 0.6 of a percent of human-
ity’s current energy demand. Geothermal energy sources currently supply 
the world with more energy than solar and wind energy sources combined.

Geothermal power does have its downsides. Installing a system takes a long 
time, and the drilling is costly — similar to drilling for oil, but without as big 
a financial payback. Additionally, concern exists that drilling for geothermal 
energy can cause earthquakes because every geothermal hot spot is in a 
geologically active area. Supporters of geothermal energy contend that these 
quakes would likely be so small that you wouldn’t be able to feel them. Others 
maintain that not enough evidence exists to say that geothermal drilling 
causes earthquakes at all.
Another way to take advantage of our planet’s underground warmth is 
through earth energy, which doesn’t take its heat from magma, but from 
natural underground hot springs. Pumps can tap into these waters and use 
the warmth to heat water or the interior of a building. We discuss these heat 
pumps in Chapter 18.
Hydropower
Anyone who’s been to Niagara Falls can attest to the beauty and majesty of 
rushing water. It’s also a great way to generate energy. Hydropower uses the 
flow of water to turn turbines, which convert the energy into electricity. This 
method is very similar to how a wind turbine generates electricity.
People can generate hydropower in two ways:
 
 Impoundment systems: Water is stored in dams and reservoirs, which 
hydropower utilities can then release to help meet power demand at 
specific times.

 Unfortunately, building large dams can flood natural ecosystems and 
even nearby communities. The IEA also reports such problems as 
increased fish deaths and land erosion. (For an example of a problem-
atic impoundment system, see the sidebar “Dam it,” in this chapter.)
 
 Run-of-river hydropower plants: Water’s natural flow is used to pro-
duce power continuously. The huge power plants at Niagara Falls, for 
example, are run-of-river. If you have a stream or river on your property, 
you might be able to use it to provide some or all of your own house’s 
electricity needs. The run-of-river hydropower systems cause very little 
environmental damage.

216
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
Hydropower plants can play a huge part in reducing fossil fuel use. Eighty per-
cent of Brazil’s electricity comes from hydropower. Consequently, the coun-
try’s power sector produces four times less carbon dioxide than comparable 
power sectors in other countries. On another positive note, hydropower is 
one of the cheapest renewable energy options available today because devel-
opers and power providers have already developed and built so much of its 
technology and infrastructure, which are in wide use.
Ocean power
If you’ve ever spent time on the sea coast, you know that the tides come in 
and flow out in a daily cycle, pulled by the moon’s gravitational force. You 
may find yourself scooting your towel up the beach a few feet while the hours 
of the afternoon go by. Not only can the tides move you off the beach; they 
can move turbines, too.
Ocean power functions in basically the same way as hydropower, using the 
force created by the movement of water. But rather than coming from river 
flow, this water power comes from the movement of the currents, tides, and 
waves. Here’s how each works:
Dam it
Looking over the Yangtze River, the third longest 
river in the world, Chinese developers (envision-
ing a huge source of hydropower) said, “Dam 
it.” Under development when we wrote this, 
the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River 
is a 15-year, $25 billion project that will be the 
world’s biggest hydropower dam by the time it’s 
complete in 2009.
The dam’s impact on locals and on the environ-
ment has been widely criticized. The dam has 
already displaced 1 million people, the majority 
of whom are poor, and critics say the govern-
ment hasn’t properly resettled the displaced. 
When it’s complete, the dam will bring water 
levels up to a height that would completely 
inundate old towns — including dumps, mines, 
and factories that will seriously pollute the 
waters. The Yangtze also affects fisheries — 
with much less freshwater and sediment get-
ting to the ocean, scientists expect fish catches 
to decline.
This example shows that even renewable 
energy sources can have their social and 
environmental issues. Future hydropower 
developers need to closely consider the whole 
picture before they implement large structural 
changes.

217
 Chapter 13: A Whole New World of Energy
 
 Currents: Turbines are placed in flow regions of naturally occurring 
strong currents.
 
 Tides: At full tide, water is held back with gates. When the ocean 
reaches low tide, the gates are lifted and the water flows out forcefully, 
spinning turbines to generate electricity.
 
 Waves: Turbines are put in the areas of strong wave action, and each 
wave that hits the turbines spins them.
As with almost all renewable energy, tidal power sources have a high start-up 
cost, but the environmental benefits could be huge; tidal and ocean energy 
give off no emissions. For countries that have long coastlines, including 
Canada, the U.S., and Australia, ocean power holds huge potential. France 
and China are already using tidal power.
Tidal technologies are still being perfected, however. Ocean power develop-
ers are currently working on new pilot projects that use more efficient tech-
nology that does not involve damming bays or estuaries. These new projects 
employ turbines on the floor of coastal zones (previous projects worked on 
the surface of the waves).
From plants to energy
Any herbivore or vegetarian can tell you that plants are full of energy, but 
some plants can power more than just people and animals. When you fer-
ment plants that are high in sugar, such as corn and sugarcane, they form 
a kind of alcohol, known as ethanol, that you can use as a fuel (or bio-fuel, 
meaning it comes from living organisms).
 
Hypothetically, scientists consider bio-fuels to be zero-emission. Even though 
engines emit greenhouse gas when they burn the fuel, that process works in a 
closed-loop cycle: The carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere is the same 
carbon dioxide that the plant absorbed from the atmosphere when it was 
growing. Bio-fuels also release less carbon dioxide when burned than conven-
tional gasoline. Those bio-fuels that are not truly zero-emission are those that 
use a lot of fossil fuels in the growing process. That is why corn ethanol is less 
efficient than sugarcane.
Consternation over corn
Ethanol from corn is controversial because it uses a global staple food for 
fuel. Corn-based ethanol distorts the market because some farmers plant less 
of one crop (wheat, for example) to benefit from government subsidies for 
growing corn or grain for fuel. These subsidies are a real factor in the U.S. 
and Canada. (We talk about government subsidies in Chapter 10.)

218
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Almost everything people eat nowadays connects to corn somehow. You can 
break corn down into many forms, including corn flour, corn oil, and corn 
syrup. You can find it far beyond breakfast cereals — you munch on corn 
when you eat licorice, table syrup, ketchup, and beer. Behind the meat coun-
ter, the beef, pork, chicken, turkey, and even fish that you buy eat corn feed. 
Even your chicken nuggets are about 75-percent corn. Forget food — you can 
find corn products in your toothpaste and lipstick, and even in your drywall, 
cleaners, and paper products. . . . Need we say more?
The majority of people in the world — those living in developing countries — 
depend on corn as the basis of their diet. Consequently, energy experts agree 
that humanity shouldn’t make fuels from food crops, especially corn.
 
The developers behind corn ethanol say that they won’t use corn in the future 
after they find new sources for ethanol. They assert that corn is like a practice 
run, aiding them to determine which plant sources work most efficiently in 
developing fuel. The corn era of ethanol is comparable to the black-and-white 
era of television — with a technological breakthrough just around the corner.
Other sources for bio-fuel
In Brazil, they use sugarcane as the source of their ethanol production. 
Sugarcane is a much more effective source than corn, particularly because 
it produces about seven crops before you need to replant it. For this reason, 
you need to use less energy to produce it than you do to produce corn. 
Unlike when you grow corn, you don’t need tractors that run on gas or pesti-
cides to grow sugarcane. Sugarcane just grows. Another advantage of using 
sugarcane to produce ethanol is that sugarcane isn’t a staple food crop, so 
using it for ethanol doesn’t risk raising food prices.
#
#?
!
 
Brazil’s sugarcane farming is controversial, too, because farmers could clear 
rainforests to produce sugarcane. The removal of forests contributes 25 to 
30 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases. (We consider this conundrum in 
Chapter 12.)
Another possible solution to the bio-fuel problem is to forgo fresh plants 
entirely. In the following section, we look at how agricultural waste can 
make ethanol.
Nothing wasted
One person’s garbage is another person’s alternative energy source. 
Although our civilization produces a great deal of waste, it can turn some of 
that waste into fuel for energy. Solid waste (such as plant waste and animal 
waste, which would otherwise go to the compost or landfill), liquid waste 
(such as used frying oil), and gases (which our landfill sites emit) all offer 
power possibilities.

219
 Chapter 13: A Whole New World of Energy
Solid waste: Biomass
We can burn the plant and animal waste that currently packs landfills to pro-
duce energy — this material is called biomass. (Living organic matter burned 
for fuel is also considered biomass.) Humans have used the simplest form 
of biomass for thousands of years — wood for fires. People still use wood in 
fireplaces and woodstoves to this day, and many countries in the developing 
world depend on wood for both cooking and heating their homes.
Biomass has evolved beyond wood and fire, however. Today, possible bio-
mass sources include solid plant waste from
 
 Farms: Corn stalks, straw, manure
 
 Forestry and paper industry: Bark, wood scraps, sawdust, pulp, 
wood chips
 
 Home: Kitchen food scraps, yard and garden clippings, sewage sludge
 
 Vineyards: Grape waste after the grapes are processed and crushed
Burning garbage is different than burning biomass. Toxic chemicals released 
from burning garbage can be hazardous to human health.
Burning biomass emits carbon dioxide (and some nitrogen oxide and sulfur 
dioxide) when burned. Nevertheless, burning biomass releases fewer emis-
sions than burning coal does.
 
Burning waste is carbon-neutral only if it comes from plant materials because 
the carbon dioxide released is only what the plants absorbed when growing.
You can burn biomass along with coal. In this scenario, biomass replaces 
some — but not all — of the coal burned for energy, lowering the emissions 
produced. This technology is called co-firing. Coal plants can begin co-firing 
right away because you generally burn both coal and biomass by using boil-
ers that heat water to create steam, which then turns turbines to create 
Not your regular smokehouse
In some situations, using biomass as a renew-
able resource does more harm than good. Two 
and a half billion people in the world today use 
biomass — animal poop, farm crop waste, char-
coal, and wood — as fuel for daily cooking and 
heating needs. In many developing countries, 
people use fires to cook and to heat their small 
homes. This smoke creates major health prob-
lems for the children living in these homes.
International development organizations are 
currently working to promote solar cooking 
stoves as a clean alternative, which provides 
the added benefit of healthier lungs.

220
Part V: Solving the Problem 
electricity. Usually, a coal plant can’t replace more than 15 percent of its 
coal with biomass without losing efficiency. Someone would have to develop 
a new system designed for biomass to make a plant work efficiently using a 
higher percentage of biomass.
You can even use biomass right in your own home, never mind what the 
power plant is doing down the road. Zoë’s uncle was the first person she knew 
to install a wood-pellet-burning stove in his home. The wood pellets are made 
of wood scraps and burn much more efficiently than logs in a wood stove. 
Straw pellets are also extremely efficient heat sources. We talk more about 
energy-efficient changes you can make in your own home in Chapter 18.
You can also turn biomass into bio-fuel, which we talk about in the follow-
ing section.
Liquid waste
People use renewable sources to create bio-fuel, and bio-fuel can replace 
petroleum-based fuel in gas and diesel engines. The most common and devel-
oped types of bio-fuel are ethanol (technically called bioethanol) and biod-
iesel. The section “From plants to energy,” earlier in this chapter, discusses 
bio-fuel and ethanol in detail; in the following sections, we discuss how you 
can use waste products for these fuels.
Ethanol
Ethanol is alcohol based and can be derived from many different kinds of 
plant material — even plant waste. The plant only needs to contain sugars. 
This group includes corn, wheat, rice, sugarcane, sugar beets, yard clippings, 
and potato skins.
You can use straw and switch grass, wood chips, corn husks, and poplar 
trees as bio-fuel fodder, too. Because these plants aren’t high in sugar, they 
must undergo a special process involving an enzyme that digests their cel-
lulose and turns it into a sugar. This kind of ethanol is called cellulosic. 
Companies such as Iogen and Shell are now making it commercially available.
Cellulosic ethanol does carry a higher cost than corn and grain ethanol 
due to an additional stage required in processing, but it has considerable 
benefits. It makes use of agricultural waste, instead of using the crop itself 
(which can constrain food supplies). And because it comes from existing 
waste or a naturally growing source, like switch grass, rather than a culti-
vated agro-business crop, it requires far less energy to produce, resulting in 
fewer emissions.
 
Nothing in nature is really waste, so people need to consider the nutrient 
value of corn husks and straw going back to the soil versus using it as a bio-
mass for fuel.

221
 Chapter 13: A Whole New World of Energy
Biodiesel
Biodiesel is oil based, and people can make it from sources such as used 
frying oil. Aside from deriving energy from a waste product, you also get the 
extra benefit of smelling French fries from the tailpipe of any passing car. In 
Owen Sound, Ontario, a local biodiesel manufacturer uses stale-dated mar-
garine to make a very good fuel. It sells for ten cents less a liter than regular 
diesel. (I can’t believe it’s not diesel!)
Gas from garbage
Organic materials are composed largely of hydrocarbons, which are made 
up of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon atoms. When organic material decays, 
it releases gases, mainly carbon dioxide (carbon and oxygen) and methane 
(carbon and hydrogen), made from these atoms. Although it’s a potent green-
house gas (see Chapter 2), people such as farmers outside of Ottawa, Canada, 
are using methane as an energy source, processing their manure and food 
waste to power a generator; the waste becomes neutral (and a high-grade fer-
tilizer) and doesn’t poison the water supply. You can also capture methane 
from landfills, major composting facilities, or sewage treatment plants, and 
then burn it to produce energy. Methane does release carbon dioxide, but at 
a very low level, when you burn it.
 
Capturing methane gas from a landfill in Idaho powers 24,000 local homes. The 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Landfill Methane Outreach Program 
supports this project and hundreds of others.
Exploring Another Non-Renewable 
Energy Source: Nuclear Power
Nuclear technology produces electricity around the world. It’s also a hot 
topic of debate. Now that people recognize the climate change in the air, 
nuclear power has regained favor among some as a low-emission energy 
source. The International Energy Agency expects the use of nuclear energy to 
increase in some jurisdictions, but it also expects the overall share of nuclear 
energy versus all energy sources to actually decrease in the future.
Understanding nuclear power
Nuclear reactors produce electricity through nuclear fission (or splitting 
the atom). Current conventional reactors use uranium, a naturally occur-
ring radioactive mineral, as the fuel for the chain reaction of nuclear fission, 
when one molecule blasts off an electron to split another molecule. The heat 

222
Part V: Solving the Problem 
generated by the chain reaction boils water to create steam, which turns 
turbines to make electricity. Essentially, nuclear power is just a tea kettle on 
a very dangerous nuclear fire.
Nuclear power is a non-renewable resource because the Earth has a finite 
supply of uranium, although it has more uranium than fossil fuels. Uranium 
has its definite drawbacks as a material, which we discuss in the section 
“Weighing the negatives,” later in this chapter.
Looking at the positives
Nuclear energy’s supporters cite the following benefits:
 
 Less scarce than oil: Although the Earth doesn’t have an unlimited 
supply of uranium, compared to fossil fuels, uranium is a relatively plen-
tiful resource, available around the world.
 
 Low greenhouse gas emissions: Nuclear power plants produce only 
indirect emissions, relating to mining and transporting the uranium, 
building the plant, and (depending on the type of reactor) enriching the 
uranium.
 
 Mature technology: Unlike the other energy sources we discuss in this 
chapter, the infrastructure and systems to support nuclear power plants 
and related mining activities are already in place in some countries.
 
 Steady cost: The price of nuclear energy does not fluctuate as much as 
the price of energy generated from fossil fuels. (The cost of constructing 
nuclear generators, however, continues to rise.)
Weighing the negatives
Detractors of nuclear power voice major concerns, including the following:
 
 Health concerns: Long-term health studies vary, but a number of 
recent studies demonstrate higher cancer rates among populations 
that live near nuclear reactors. Uranium mining also endangers the 
health of miners.
 
 High capital and maintenance costs: Nuclear plants are expensive to 
start up and maintain.
 
 Non-renewable resource: Uranium is finite; when it’s gone, it’s gone.
 
 Reliability: Nations around the world have varying success with reac-
tor reliability. Some countries, such as Canada, have had persistent 
problems keeping reactors on line. Breakdowns and retrofits have cost 
taxpayers billions of dollars.

223
 Chapter 13: A Whole New World of Energy
 
 Risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons: People can use nuclear fuels 
in nuclear weapons. India made its first nuclear weapon by using spent 
fuel from a Canadian reactor.
 
 Safe storage of nuclear waste: Nuclear waste must be kept out of the 
biosphere for at least a quarter of a billion years before it’s no longer 
toxic. No current technology can contain nuclear waste for that length 
of time.
 
 Safety of nuclear plants themselves: Many people equate nuclear power 
with the Chernobyl disaster, the near-meltdown of a nuclear power 
plant in the Soviet Union in 1986. Fears exist that a major accident could 
happen again. Nuclear reactors do run an extremely small risk of experi-
encing a catastrophic accident.
 
 Security concerns: Some people worry that terrorists could target 
nuclear plants and materials because of the great and long-lasting 
damage such an attack could cause.
Negotiations for what technologies to accept under the Clean Development 
Mechanism (CDM — which is part of the Kyoto Protocol) ruled out nuclear 
technologies. (Refer to Chapter 11 for more about the Kyoto Protocol and 
see Chapter 12 to explore the CDM.) The member countries to the Kyoto 
Protocol officially decided that nuclear power isn’t clean enough for the 
Clean Development Mechanism. The European Union voiced a similar view of 
nuclear energy. Working toward a goal of getting 20 percent of energy from 
renewable sources by 2020, Germany, Spain, and Sweden are committed to 
shutting down their nuclear plants. France relies on nuclear energy in a big 
way, however, and so does Switzerland.

hen it comes to fighting climate change, one thing you may hear busi-
nesses tell you is that they can’t afford to reduce greenhouse gases 
and switch to sustainable energy. If people expect companies to spend a for-
tune on reducing greenhouse gases, business reps say, those businesses will 
be hobbled in today’s competitive marketplace.
In fact, many businesses are already on the greenhouse gas–reduction 
bandwagon. General Electric is the largest company in the United States. Its 
CEO, Jeff Immelt, has said that he’ll double General Electric’s investments 
in energy and environmental technologies to exploit what he sees as a huge 
global market for products that help other companies — and countries such 
as China and India — reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. BP, the 
former British Petroleum (which now goes only by its initials), talks openly 
today of going “Beyond Petroleum.” It used to be an oil company, but it 
now sees itself as being in the energy business, developing new sustainable 
alternative energy sources, such as hydrogen and bio-fuels, and working to 
reduce GHG emissions in other ways. Both companies are concerned, respon-
sible, corporate citizens; also, they understand that when it comes to climate 
change, corporate responsibility is good for both the planet and the bottom 
line. They know, too, that if they don’t take the lead, the government may — 
something we talk about in Chapter 10.

226
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Companies can improve how they manufacture products, using modern 
energy-efficient equipment and recycling. But more than just manufacturers 
and oil companies can get in on the game. Companies can also get involved 
in the creation of new green services, or they can get involved in the carbon 
market. They can change how they construct buildings or turn wood into 
paper. And you can help them by demanding new, greener products that 
don’t produce as much greenhouse gas, and by rewarding those companies 
that put sound greenhouse gas–fighting practices in place. You’re their 
customer — and the customer is always right.
Processing and Manufacturing 
Efficiently
Most manufacturing requires a great deal of energy, usually from fossil fuels 
that create a lot of carbon dioxide emissions. In many cases, much of this 
energy is actually wasted, thanks to old and inefficient equipment and weak 
regulations governing its use. The actual manufacturing process creates even 
more greenhouse gases.
Taking steps to conserve energy
Manufacturing doesn’t have to be wasteful; with some tweaks, industry 
can use less power, causing fewer greenhouse gas emissions. There are 
numerous environmental consulting firms all over the world, as well as non-
governmental organizations, that specialize in working with businesses, 
companies, and industry to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by low-
ering energy use.
Here are a few steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) recommends manufacturers take to help conserve energy:
 
 Measure how much energy the manufacturing process uses and how 
many emissions it creates. Use this information to set benchmarks 
and goals for reduction. The industry can measure its success from the 
changes it makes.
 
 Use the correct-size equipment properly and conservatively. Keep the 
equipment tuned up and fix malfunctions when they occur. Also, choose 
equipment such as the optimal size of piping to cut energy use.

227
 Chapter 14: Show Me the Money: Business and Industrial Solutions
 
 You’d be surprised how often mismatched pipes and over-sized motors 
waste large amounts of energy. Energy guru Amory Lovins, of the Rocky 
Mountain Institute, estimates that the U.S. could cut electricity use by 
40 percent simply by replacing the wrong-sized electrical motors with 
motors that are the correct size!
 
 Use more energy-efficient motors and equipment. Running motors 
accounts for over 60 percent of electricity use in European and U.S. 
industries, and businesses can run motors more effectively by changing 
materials and improving aerodynamics. Businesses need to improve the 
efficiency of all pieces of equipment — even fans and pumps — along 
the way.
 
 Insulate buildings and equipment sufficiently. Insulation keeps any 
building’s energy use low, whether you’re trying to keep the heat in or 
out. Likewise, insulating hot water pipes reduces the loss of heat and 
also lessens the energy needed to heat the water and compensate for 
the lost heat.
 
 Reduce leaks of any sort (such as air and steam). For example, when 
the pressure of the steam drives a turbine, escaping steam reduces 
efficiency. The boiler has to run that much harder to make up for lost 
steam. Air leaking into boilers and furnaces can have the same impact. 
Leaks mean that energy is being spent driving the air or steam into 
places it shouldn’t be.
 
 Recycle materials. Both the steel and aluminum industries have found 
recycling to be a major advantage. Recycling the steel from old furnaces, 
for example, makes up a whole third of global steel production and uses 
30 to 40 percent of what the process takes if started from raw materials.
Not only can these steps help companies cut back on their greenhouse gas 
emissions through lower energy use; they can also save companies money by 
no longer wasting pricey power.
Using energy efficiently
With the money saved through energy conservation, companies can adopt 
new, efficient technologies for applications such as electric equipment, heat-
ers, and boiler systems:
 
 Systems powered by sustainable energy: Industries can use their own 
biomass waste, such as wood, food, pulp, and paper scraps, as fuel. 
Some industries can power themselves by using methane from landfills 
to run boilers. Solar and wind power are other renewable options. (Refer 
to Chapter 13 for more about sustainable energy.)

228
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
 Not every industry can turn to sustainable energy; some manufacturers 
require a particular fuel, such as the iron industry, which uses coke. 
(Refer to Chapter 5 for more about the steel industry.)
 
 Combining heat and power: Businesses can use up to 90 percent of the 
excess heat given off by power production (or generated by machin-
ery) to replace regular heating within a building or buildings, instead of 
simply pumping that heat out of the building. Businesses in Germany 
and the Netherlands use this technology, known as co-generation.
Table 14-1 shows how much nations can reduce their emissions if their indus-
tries switch to more efficient technologies. (A metric megaton [Mt] is one mil-
lion metric tons, and a kiloton [Kt] is one thousand metric tons.)

High-efficiency, new technology can save companies money in the long run, 
reducing their energy consumption considerably, but the technology isn’t 
cheap to obtain. Companies in developing countries, especially, might balk at 
the expense of high-efficiency equipment, and understandably so — develop-
ing countries often simply don’t have the budgets and financial support for 
energy-effective technology.
 
Subsidies from national governments for energy-efficient practices can help 
industries make big changes in how they operate. The Kyoto Protocol offers 
two programs to help developing countries obtain these new technologies: 
The Clean Development Mechanism and joint implementation.

229
 Chapter 14: Show Me the Money: Business and Industrial Solutions
 
 The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): Under this program, indus-
trialized countries pay for clean energy projects in developing countries.
 
 Joint implementation: Through this program, industrialized countries 
and developing economies partner to implement projects such as cap-
turing methane from landfills and using it to produce energy, or shifting 
from coal to renewable energy sources.
Both programs help industries in the developing world introduce efficient 
technologies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (We cover the Kyoto 
Protocol in Chapter 11 and discuss these programs in Chapter 12.)
Considering individual industries
Although the steps laid out by the IPCC (which we discuss in “Taking steps 
to conserve energy”) are relevant to most manufacturers, specific industries 
face particular challenges.
Cement production, for instance, is a particularly carbon-intensive industry, 
making up a whopping 5 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions in the world. 
Parts of these processes are unavoidable, such as the carbon dioxide that the 
limestone of the cement naturally gives off when the cement forms. However, 
the industry could benefit from using energy from renewable resources or 
from systems that capture and store the carbon dioxide emissions under-
ground. (We talk about storing carbon dioxide in Chapter 13.)
Other greenhouse gas–intensive industries have found some innovative ways 
to reduce their emissions. Here are a couple:
 
 Pulp and paper: Canada’s forestry giant Tembec has managed to reduce 
its production of greenhouse gases directly and indirectly. It recycles 
wood chips and other waste as fuel, burning them in place of higher 
carbon-emitting fossil fuels. (This kind of fuel use is sometimes called 
a closed loop system, in which you don’t input to or output from the 
system — it’s a full cycle.) Tembec now dries its pulp by using more 
efficient hot air dryers, replacing earlier steam units that were fossil-fuel 
powered. Tembec even extracts sugar from the cooking liquor, the fluid 
left over after paper is manufactured, and turns it into ethanol, which it 
then sells as a product to be used in things like antiseptics and sanitiz-
ers. Flip over to Chapter 13 for more on using plants and waste as fuel.
 
 Thanks to steps such as the ones Tembec has taken, the Forest Products 
Association of Canada boasts that it has met and far exceeded the Kyoto 
target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions to 6 percent below 1990 
levels. They’ve actually reduced their emissions to 42 percent below 
1990 levels!

230
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
 Aluminum: Many aluminum companies are concentrating today on recy-
cling. To recycle aluminum, these companies need to use only 5 percent 
of the energy they would need to manufacture it from raw ore. One man-
ufacturer, Alcoa, plans to boost the percentage of recycled aluminum it 
uses in new production to 50 percent by 2050.
 
 Thanks to the introduction of newer technology, the aluminum industry 
has been able to reduce its production of perfluorocarbons, the particu-
larly nasty greenhouse gas that captures from 6,500 to 9,200 times more 
heat than carbon dioxide.
Trading Carbon between Manufacturers
Some manufacturers and producers can reduce their greenhouse gas emis-
sions more easily than others. To address that imbalance and enable indus-
tries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions across the board, some 
jurisdictions and commodity traders have created carbon markets. The 
carbon market isn’t like a flea market, the sort of place you drop by on a 
Saturday morning to pick up a bargain in chunks of coal.
Here’s how a private carbon market works:
 
1. Companies form a group and make a commitment to each other.
 
2. They agree on how they want to reduce their emissions over the year 
individually and collectively.
 
3. If the company reduces its emissions more than planned, it has carbon 
credits, which it can sell. If a company doesn’t make its goal, it can buy 
someone else’s credits. (Another name for this process is cap and trade.)
Companies can actually make money by reducing their output, creating 
carbon credits and selling them. The carbon market ensures that carbon diox-
ide levels are being reduced. It just doesn’t worry about where or by whom.
Although the majority of carbon markets around the world are government 
initiatives, businesses can and have implemented emissions trading them-
selves. (We discuss government-led carbon markets in Chapter 10.) The 
Chicago Climate Exchange is the world’s first voluntary carbon market. It 
goes beyond carbon dioxide to include almost all greenhouse gas emissions. 
The organizations involved in this exchange make a voluntary, yet legally 
binding, commitment to reducing emissions. Participants range from uni-
versities to retail businesses to power-generating companies — Rolls Royce, 
DuPont, and Sony Electronics are among the members that have committed 
to reductions. Internal committees regulate the system, and to make sure 
everyone’s living up to their commitments, a third party oversees the emis-
sion reductions.

231
 Chapter 14: Show Me the Money: Business and Industrial Solutions
Beyond do-gooding, businesses can make money in carbon trading. 
Goldman Sachs, a U.S. investment bank, owns shares in the Chicago Climate 
Exchange and the European Climate Exchange. (We talk more about how 
banks are getting involved in fighting climate change — and profiting, in the 
process — in the section “Support from the Professional Service Sector,” 
later in this chapter.)
Building Greener Buildings
Production and services aren’t the only ways that companies can fight the 
good greenhouse gas fight. They can make a difference by changing how 
they do business, but also where they do it — their offices and factories. 
These big buildings currently emit a lot of greenhouse gas, but that means 
they also present a big opportunity. In fact, the IPCC reports that improving 
the efficiency of commercial and industrial buildings is a more cost-effective 
way of reducing greenhouse gases than overhauling industry’s manufactur-
ing processes.
Adaptation for industry
Industry is as vulnerable to the effects of cli-
mate change as are communities and individu-
als. Businesses need to adapt to these changes, 
just like everyone else.
In part, they need to make mundane, obvious 
adaptations — renovating facilities to antici-
pate extreme weather, for example.
Mining companies are re-engineering tail-
ing ponds, the holding ponds for mine waste, 
to prepare for more extreme weather events. 
Diamond mines in the Arctic are adapting to the 
warming weather — the winter roads, relying 
on consistently frozen ice and snow, on which 
they used to rely are now available for less of 
the year, due to climate change. This is driving 
up their costs because they have to fly more 
goods in.
Industry can also make proactive adaptations, 
however, involving diversifying and thinking 
in new ways. BP is a prime example of smart 
adaptation. By broadening its mandate beyond 
oil, it can supply the market’s energy needs, 
whether the world depends on oil, ethanol, 
solar power, or wind energy.
Any major production or manufacturing com-
pany can take similar actions. Forestry and 
agriculture-based companies, for example, 
can diversify their resource base so that they 
harvest from numerous small locations, rather 
than one large location. This adaptation can 
allow them to continue supplying wood to the 
market, even if climate change and its effects 
impact one area, for example, with forest fires 
or droughts.

Part V: Solving the Problem 
Cutting back on heating and cooling
Businesses often use the most energy keeping an office or factory warm in 
the winter or cool in the summer. Those businesses can cut back on energy 
consumption by installing heating and cooling systems that don’t guzzle 
so much (or any) carbon-emitting fuels. In Chapter 18, we look at different 
heating and cooling options for houses, and these solutions also apply to 
companies. Companies can reduce their heating- and cooling-related energy 
consumption in some very simple and inexpensive ways:
 
 Insulation: A properly insulated building doesn’t require nearly as much 
energy to heat or cool. You lose about 60 percent of the heat pumped 
into a poorly insulated building through the roof and the walls alone.
 
 Air circulation: Buildings in moderate climates can benefit from using 
systems that either keep the outside air out or let it in, depending on 
whether you need to heat or cool the building on that day.
 
 A green roof: A rooftop that features layers of grass, soil, and water-
proof lining naturally cools a building, providing insulation and reflect-
ing the sun’s light (unlike black asphalt roofing, which absorbs it). In 
fact, a green roof reduces air-conditioning demand by 25 percent. The 
plants on these roofs have the added bonus of absorbing some extra 
carbon from the atmosphere.
 
 A white roof: For roofs that can’t support plant life, a simple lick of 
white paint can help cool buildings in hot climates because the white 
paint reflects light.
Good insulation coupled with good natural lighting can even heat a whole 
building. The Rocky Mountain Institute in Colorado is (as the name suggests) 
located in the Rockies and is under heavy snow much of the winter, yet the 
building has no furnace. It relies instead on the sun’s rays, which stream in 
through giant windows, and it holds that heat through maximum insulation. 
They even grow bananas indoors to show the building’s balmy conditions. 
Check out founder Amory Lovins’s Web site for more wonderful information 
on the enormous potential of energy efficiency: www.rmi.org.
Exploring energy alternatives
Business and industry can lead the charge in shifting buildings away from 
consuming fossil fuels and toward renewable resources. Because their build-
ings consume so much energy, when they make a change, it has a big effect. 
Wal-Mart launched a renewable energy initiative in 2007, committing to using 

233
 Chapter 14: Show Me the Money: Business and Industrial Solutions
solar power for 30 percent of the energy needs at 22 of its stores — a tiny 
fraction of the almost 6,500 Wal-Mart stores worldwide. This seemingly small 
initiative ranks among the ten largest solar installations in the world because 
of Wal-Mart’s multinational reach and number of buildings it controls. Wal-
Mart’s ultimate goal is to become 100-percent reliant on renewable fuels and 
produce no waste. (For an overview of the energy alternatives that busi-
nesses can investigate, check out Chapter 13.)
By creating its own energy from renewable sources, a building can remove 
itself from the electricity grid — or, at least, reduce its use of energy coming 
from the grid. The more energy a building can produce on its own, the more 
money the owner saves. In some jurisdictions, building owners can even sell 
their excess renewable energy back to the grid and make a profit.
Certifying new buildings
Improving efficiency and energy sources can cut back on the greenhouse 
gas emissions of existing business buildings, but when companies require 
new buildings, they have the opportunity to really go green. They can ensure 
that their new digs are as greenhouse gas–smart as possible by following 
environmental standards. Having a standard for buildings sets the bar for 
companies. And while companies improve and compete, they raise the bar 
by raising standards.
In North America, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) 
leads the way. The United States Green Building Council created and con-
stantly modifies the LEED to reflect new practices and materials. The LEED 
provides a set of standards that new or renovated buildings must achieve to 
be certified. LEED standards encompass all aspects of a building’s construc-
tion, including the following:
 
 The percentage of demolition material recycled (in the instances when a 
building was demolished to make way for new construction)
 
 How efficiently the building uses water
 
 The materials used and what percentage of those materials came from 
less than 500 miles away
LEED also has a certification program for architects and engineers to con-
firm their understanding of green building products and practices. To find 
out more about LEED in the United States, see www.usgbc.org. For LEED in 
Canada, check out www.cagbc.org.

234
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Other countries have programs similar to LEED:
 
 United Kingdom: The Building Research Establishment and 
Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is the first set of envi-
ronmental building standards established anywhere — developed even 
before LEED. BREEAM has specific requirements for the widest range of 
buildings — from schools to warehouses to theaters. They even have a 
ranking for prisons! (You can visit the BREEAM site at www.breeam.org.)
 
 Australia: Green Star is run by the Green Building Council of Australia. 
Green Star was inspired by BREEAM and LEED, but modified to better 
fit the Australian environment. Its particular focus is office buildings, 
from design, to construction, to retrofits. Green Star hands out stars (up 
to six) to buildings that meet its environmental standards. It plans to 
expand its standards to cover industrial, retail, and residential buildings. 
(For more info, visit www.gbca.org.au.)
 
 Australian toolmaker Bordo International’s new head office was awarded 
five stars; their project design is expected to reel in a 68-percent energy 
savings, thanks to effective insulation, windows, and blinds.
 
Corporate Success Stories
If you zone out whenever you hear the word “corporate” because it seems so 
big and heartless (or just plain boring), we want to change that. Corporations 
are using their big profiles (and big budgets) to help reduce emissions. Table

Part V: Solving the Problem 
Support from the Professional 
Service Sector
Although some people might say that bankers, insurers, and lawyers produce 
a lot of hot air, their businesses don’t immediately come to mind when you 
think of global warming. Nevertheless, companies in those sectors have seen 
the silver lining of profitability in the climate change cloud and have gotten 
involved with ventures that help others cut back on carbon.
Banking on the environment
Many banks are becoming involved with the fight against climate change by 
offering specialized services to clients committed to reducing greenhouse 
gases or providing renewable resources:
 
 Goldman Sachs: American investment bank Goldman Sachs has 
invested heavily in carbon markets, owning large shares in the Chicago 
Climate Exchange and the European Climate Exchange. (We talk 
about private carbon trading in the section “Trading Carbon between 
Manufacturers,” earlier in this chapter.) Goldman Sachs also founded 
the Center for Environmental Markets, which issues grants for research 
in market solutions for environmental issues. The company has invested 
over $1.5 billion in renewable energy sources.
 
 Bank of America: This second-largest U.S. bank has created an environ-
mental banking group dedicated to conservation and reducing global 
warming. The bank’s new headquarters in New York is housed in one of 
the greenest skyscrapers ever built.
 
 ABN AMRO: This Dutch banking giant, which refers to climate change 
on its Web site (www.abnamro.com) as “both a challenge and an oppor-
tunity,” offers risk management services to help its clients reduce their 
possible losses from climate change.
Insuring against climate change
The insurance industry has a vested interest in stopping climate change; the 
extreme weather it will bring (which we discuss in Chapter 7) will result in a 
huge surge in claims. Knowing that investing today can prevent giant payouts 
in the future, American International Group (AIG) offers financial support 
to projects that encourage greenhouse gas emission reductions. AIG says it 

237
 Chapter 14: Show Me the Money: Business and Industrial Solutions
may invest in forests, renewable energy resources, greenhouse gas mitigat-
ing technologies, and green real estate. The Zurich-based Swiss insurance 
company Swiss RE is also interested in working to reduce and profit from the 
danger of climate change, and in 2008, it was named “one of the world’s 100 
most sustainable companies” by Innovest Strategic Investment Advisors.
The insurance industry is actively funding research efforts. In Canada, 
insurance companies fund the Centre for Catastrophic Loss Reduction at 
the University of Western Ontario. In Bonn, Germany, the Munich Climate 
Insurance Initiative (MCII) is helping to develop alternative insurance prod-
ucts that can facilitate both spreading climate-related risks (ensuring that no 
one insurance company shoulders the burden of paying out for the aftermath 
of extreme weather events) and adaptation-response measures. Members 
of the MCII include the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, 
German Watch, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and indi-
viduals from the World Bank and Munich Reinsurance Company. The insur-
ance industry largely funds the effort.
Making it legal
Many law firms are actively engaged in making the fight against global warm-
ing a legal imperative. Firms such as the U.S.-based Baker & McKenzie offer to 
help government clients worldwide develop climate change laws and regula-
tions. Firms also offer services on carbon markets, carbon-offset projects, 
and trading emissions. The legal framework for such projects, even those 
outside government regulations, requires careful drafting.
 
But beyond the services they offer, law firms are businesses like any other. They 
have an impact through the energy they use and the paper waste that they pro-
duce when they work with clients on important issues. The U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency and the American Bar Association have partnered up to 
address climate change issues through a voluntary program. They created the 
Law Office Climate Challenge (www.abanet.org/environ/climatechallenge). 
The program has over 60 law firms signed on to one of three commitments:
 
 Buying renewable energy
 
 Lowering the amount of waste produced
 
 Cutting office energy use by at least 10 percent
All the actions in this simple and effective program can help reduce the law 
profession’s carbon footprint.

238
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Farming and Forestry
Farming and forestry are uniquely posed to make a difference in the fight to 
stop global warming. Like all industries, they can cut back on their green-
house gas emissions by improving their energy efficiency and moving to sus-
tainable energy sources. But what makes them truly exceptional is that they 
can actually increase how much carbon dioxide is absorbed from the natural 
greenery and soils under their management. Talk about a global warming 
one-two punch! How agriculture and forestry use the land has created a third 
of global greenhouse gas emissions — which means that these industries can 
become a huge part of the solution to climate change.
Supplying bio-fuels
The waste that forestry and farming produces, such as wood, crop waste, 
and manure, doesn’t have to be wasted (although leaving waste in the forest 
or the fields isn’t necessarily wasteful — this material can provide nutrition 
to the land). All that stuff is actually biomass, biological material that humans 
can use, either by burning it to create energy or turning it into bio-fuel, which 
transportation devices can use. Bio-fuel gives off fewer greenhouse gas emis-
sions than fossil fuels when burned. People are increasingly using bio-fuel 
as either an alternative to diesel fuel or as an additive to it, which creates a 
lower-emission fuel. (You can read up on bio-fuel in Chapter 13.)
Beyond providing the materials for bio-fuels, agricultural and forestry prac-
tices can benefit from using the bio-fuel themselves. Although companies 
would have to make an initial minimal investment to convert diesel engines 
to run on bio-fuel, this investment would likely offer long-term savings, par-
ticularly while oil costs continue to rise.
Improving land management
Land management includes many elements. For forestry, land management 
involves how and where companies grow the trees and what kind of harvest-
ing methods they use. For agriculture, it involves how farmers till the soil, 
what they add to the soil, and how they grow and harvest the crops. Land 
managers can engineer all aspects of their operations to be more environ-
mentally friendly, sucking extra carbon dioxide out of the air.
Forestry
The number-one, land-management solution recommended by the IPCC for 
forestry is to decrease the areas deforested.

239
 Chapter 14: Show Me the Money: Business and Industrial Solutions
 
The IPCC says that forestry practices must change quickly to counteract 
rapid, worldwide deforestation. The IPCC warns that forestry companies need 
to know how climate changes will affect their forests. These changes could 
include an increase in how fast wood decomposes, as well as more intense 
droughts and forest fires. (Climate change won’t be bad news for all forests 
initially, however. Because of temperature increases, some trees could grow 
faster and take in more carbon dioxide.)
Instead of deforesting entire areas, the forestry industry needs to adopt more 
sustainable methods, such as selective harvesting. This method involves 
removing small groups of trees, leaving behind a range of trees of different 
ages and sizes. Selective harvesting has many benefits:
 
 Helps land stability: The root systems of trees hold the soil together 
and assist in the prevention of landslides.
 
 Keeps the forest functioning as an ecosystem: This enables it to con-
tinue to serve as habitat for wildlife.
 
 Keeps the soil healthy and productive: Healthy soil, supported by 
trees, takes in rain — a lot of it. Trees also make the soil more drought 
resistant by shading it and giving it nutrients.
Ecologists encourage selective harvesting in temperate forests primarily 
to protect wildlife habitat and biodiversity. Temperate forests include the 
boreal region, a large band of forests, through Russia, Scandinavia, Alaska, 
and Canada, which makes up about one third of the planet’s remaining for-
ests. These forests have deep soils that can support new growth after clear-
cutting. The second-growth forest lacks the species diversity of the primary 
forest, but only very rarely does a clear-cut forest in a temperate region 
result in true deforestation.
Selective harvesting is essential to the survival of forests in the tropics, how-
ever. Tropical forests grow on very thin soils, which are unlikely to be able to 
support life after the forest canopy has been cut away. Clear-cutting a tropi-
cal forest results in true deforestation.
The forestry industry can implement the sustainable practice of lengthen-
ing the time between rotations (the time between logging the forest, allowing 
regrowth, and coming back to log it again), allowing a forest to grow for a 
longer period of time before returning to log that area again. This longer 
cutting cycle would increase the carbon uptake of the forests; although 
young forests absorb carbon more quickly than old trees, older trees can 
retain far more carbon.
 
Some in the forestry industry are already taking steps, through the Forest 
Stewardship Council (FSC), to ensure that forests are sustainably managed. If 
a forest complies with the FSC’s Principles of Responsible Forest Management, 
the FSC certifies that forest, enabling the operators to use the FSC logo. 

240
Part V: Solving the Problem 
According to the FSC, more than 95 million hectares have been certified — 
about 7 percent of the world’s industrial forests — and this number is growing 
rapidly. Large companies dedicated to helping forest management help make 
these kinds of programs a success — from FSC-certified chairs to eyeliner 
pencils. (Check out www.fsc.org for more about the Forest Stewardship 
Council.)
Governments and non-governmental organizations are taking steps to reduce 
deforestation in the tropics, where trees take in carbon dioxide all year 
round, making deforestation reduction in tropical regions most effective — 
and most urgently needed. (Boreal trees in the north don’t take in carbon 
dioxide in winter months.) The majority of the world’s rainforests are found 
in developing countries. The Clean Development Mechanism, a program 
under the Kyoto Protocol, encourages industrialized countries to fund sus-
tainable forestry practices in developing countries that can help those devel-
oping countries cut greenhouse gas emissions. (We talk about this program 
in Chapter 12.)
Farming
Farming isn’t an obvious culprit when it comes to carbon emissions, but it’s 
a considerable contributor. Humanity’s ever-growing food needs and desires 
have pushed the farming industry to deforest valuable land and use emission-
heavy methods of farming. Fortunately, greener options are possible.
Location, location, location
As we discuss in Chapter 5, farmers are clearing large portions of the Amazon 
rainforest to make way for more farmland. This deforestation is disastrous 
for the climate. The most climate-friendly farms are situated on land that 
doesn’t require cutting down rainforest. Meanwhile, both industrialized and 
developing countries are displacing land for agriculture in favor of develop-
ment. Paving over land already in use for local agriculture often forces people 
to clear forests to plant their crops.
The world needs large-scale solutions to address deforestation for farmland. 
Governments in countries where deforestation for farmland is a major issue, 
such as Brazil, need to firmly regulate land use so that they can begin to deal 
with this major climate issue. We discuss how Brazil’s dealing with deforesta-
tion in Chapter 12.
Dealing in dirty solutions
Sometimes, fighting climate change can be a dirty job. Healthy soil is a criti-
cal partner in absorbing carbon, but it can also be a major source of carbon 
dioxide emissions. If farmers modify farming practices to protect the health 
of the soil, they could cut back on 89 percent of agriculture’s carbon dioxide 
emissions.

241
 Chapter 14: Show Me the Money: Business and Industrial Solutions
The first step that farmers can take to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is 
to change how they manage weeds so that they don’t have to till the soil as 
often — if at all. In short, the less farmers disturb the soil, the better. No-till 
agriculture increases carbon sequestration (refer to Chapter 2) in the soil.
Farmers can also cut their greenhouse gas emissions by carefully using nitro-
gen fertilizer, which adds nitrogen dioxide into the atmosphere. Careful use 
of this fertilizer means simply figuring out how much nitrogen you need to 
add so that you don’t use more than necessary, which can help ensure that 
farming gives off fewer emissions.
Farmers can also move away from chemical fertilizers and explore greener 
alternatives, such as organic farming methods. Producing and transporting 
chemical fertilizers, which are generally made from fossil fuels, is extremely 
energy-intensive. Studies have shown that organic farming methods use 
about half of the energy of conventional farming, and also sequester more 
carbon dioxide in the soil.
Reducing rice farms’ emissions
Currently, land management among rice farmers is particularly poor and 
results in the emission of methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas. 
In flooded rice fields, organic material breaks down, and because the still 
waters form an anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment, that breakdown results 
in the release of methane. Rice farmers can reduce these emissions by keep-
ing the soil dry in the non-growing season, adding any organic materials the 
soil needs during that dry period, rather than leaving the fields flooded to 
supply nutrients. In a dry field, aerobic decomposition (decomposition that 
occurs in an environment with oxygen) can happen, which doesn’t produce 
methane.
Get a green belt by planting a tree
Nobel Peace Prize–winner Wangari Maathai 
created the Green Belt Movement, which is 
actively planting trees across mid-Africa. The 
problem in Wangari’s eyes was simple: Climate 
change and related environmental problems 
could be traced to deforestation. The solution 
was just as clear: Plant trees — a lot of them.
Starting in the 1970s, she engaged women in 
a grassroots effort that led to planting over 20 
million trees. Her Kenya Green Belt Movement 
has since gone international, drawing in other 
African countries, including Uganda and 
Zimbabwe.
Maathai’s new goal, which she announced at 
the UN Climate Change Conference in 2007, is 
to get Africans to plant 1 billion trees.
You can find out more about the initiative at

The global-warming beef with cows
One of agriculture’s major sources of green-
house gas emissions is livestock. With the 
global diet changing to include more meat, the 
world has an ever-increasing number of cows, 
which means an increase in methane. Cows 
are really gassy creatures.
Scientists around the world are currently explor-
ing different ways to help cows cut this socially 
impolite and environmentally unfriendly habit. 
In the United Kingdom, research is underway to 
see whether adding garlic to a cow’s diet can 
help cut back on the gas. German scientists 
are testing a pill that traps and eliminates the 
gas in a cow’s first stomach (they have four). 
In Australia, scientists are experimenting with 
transferring bacteria from kangaroos’ stomachs 
to cows’. (Kangaroos have a similar digestive 
system and diet to cows, but they don’t suffer 
from the same gastric unpleasantness.)

W
hen you hear the word activist, you might think of angry marchers 
shouting slogans and hoisting protest signs — and you wouldn’t be 
wrong. But you can be an activist in more than one way. Around the world, 
people have banded together into groups, determined to prevent a global 
warming disaster. Some of these groups do indeed hold rallies and stage sit-
ins, but others are far more comfortable in boardrooms.
One of the most powerful forces in the world arises from people working 
together to improve society. Organizations in pursuit of social goals have been 
around for nearly 200 years, fighting against slavery, campaigning for the right 
of women to vote, and protecting the natural environment. Today, groups of 
this kind are called non-governmental organizations, or simply NGOs.
The “non-governmental” part of NGO is critical. Because these groups aren’t 
tied to any government, they can be single-minded, focusing on one thing: 
for example, fighting global warming. In this chapter, we take a look at these 
organizations, how they’re working hard to realize their goals, and how you 
can get involved.

244
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Understanding What Non-Governmental 
Organizations Do
If you enter either global warming or climate change, and then non-governmental 
organization, into a search engine on the Web, you get thousands of hits, listing 
countless groups. The sheer quantity of NGOs might seem excessive; after all, 
aren’t they all working for the same goal?
The number of NGOs indicates the enormity of the problem of global warm-
ing and just how much work needs to be done. Every NGO represents a dif-
ferent segment of the world’s population affected by climate change, and 
each group tackles the problem differently. Some groups strive to increase 
awareness about the issues. Some stay on the periphery of society, aggres-
sively trying to provoke people into action, and others work from within both 
government and industry, attempting to prompt progress.
Educating people
The scientists doing research on global warming aren’t writing for a broad 
audience; they’re writing for their peers, to further scientific knowledge. 
This communication is very important because it ensures that science is 
constantly moving forward, building on new discoveries. Unfortunately, lay-
people — the public at large — don’t always hear about important research. 
That’s where NGOs come in.
NGOs take complicated technical scientific reports, which are available to 
the general public, and translate them into language that the average person 
can understand. These people working as “translators” between science and 
the public are very familiar with the science and also understand how to 
communicate it in non-science terms. Many NGOs, such as the World Wildlife 
Fund and Greenpeace, write climate change reports that take key pieces from 
scientific reports and make them digestible to the reader. NGOs communi-
cate via fact sheets, brochures, and Web sites, as well as at conferences and 
workshops, and even in material prepared for school curricula. These orga-
nizations hope that they can present the information in a way that motivates 
people to act.
As a result, NGOs fret over even the most essential terms to ensure that 
the words have the biggest possible impact. For instance, NGOs around the 
world struggled over what to call this human-made climate crisis. Global 
warming? Climate change? Most groups opted to call the threat “climate 
change” because some places will actually get colder when the global aver-
age temperature increases. U.S. groups went with the more popularized 
“global warming,” a term with more immediate impact.

 Chapter 15: Activists without Borders: Non-Governmental Organizations
When translating science to lay language, NGOs need to be careful not to 
distort the facts. That’s why, quite often, NGOs ask scientists to review their 
work to make sure it remains accurate. (Similarly, some of the leading scien-
tists in the world reviewed this book to make sure we properly presented the 
science!) Many of the larger international environmental groups even have 
scientists on staff. For example, an internationally respected scientist from 
the Potsdam Institute, Dr. Bill Hare, also works for Greenpeace.
Keeping watch
NGOs play a key role as watchdogs over government and industry. They keep 
a close eye on what impact government and industry are having on climate 
change, and they’re quick to point out when the powers that be don’t live up 
to their green commitments.
These organizations are a big part of the reason that climate change issues 
make so many stories in the media — journalists often depend on organiza-
tions to share the top-hitting climate news story and connect them with the 
right people to talk to. (See Chapter 16 for more about the media.) Watchdog 
groups strive to ensure that the general public is as well informed as pos-
sible on climate change issues and what industry, government, and busi-
nesses are — or aren’t — doing.
Organizations often publish “report cards” that score businesses or govern-
ments on their action on climate change — a clear way to communicate the 
state of the success of these actions, which the public might not otherwise 
know about.
World Wildlife Fund, for example, exposed Nike’s high-emission running 
shoes and raised so much awareness about it that Nike agreed to change the 
gas used in the shoe air pockets, greatly reducing its greenhouse gas emis-
sions. Sinks Watch, as another example, is a project of the World Rainforest 
Movement, whose goal is to track and critically assess Kyoto Protocol carbon 
sink projects. (Check out Chapter 11 for more about the Kyoto Protocol.)
Getting the word out
Some NGOs have a reputation as rabble-rousers, constantly raising a ruckus. 
Greenpeace, for example, is famous (or is that infamous?) for unfurling enor-
mous banners from high-rise buildings, off suspension bridges, or anywhere 
else their efforts can draw attention — even if it’s against the law.
These groups know that their banners won’t make an immediate difference. 
They’re doing it for the guaranteed media coverage of their dramatic actions, 
which ensures that people will address the issue in a public forum.

246
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
Whether hanging banners or organizing mass protests, these acts are most 
certainly attention grabbers. But not everyone loves these actions — not 
even everyone in the climate change awareness community is a fan. Some 
argue that the time these NGOs spend in these attention-drawing endeavors 
would be better spent working with industry or government to find solu-
tions, rather than slamming those industries and governments with banners. 
Advocates for the stunts point out that direct actions bring a visual element 
to global warming, a threat that looms like a slow motion tsunami which is 
hard for media to cover.
Working with industry and government
From much of the news coverage you see, you might think that all environ-
mental groups spend their time yelling at corporations and governments 
across barricades — and that industry and government spend their time 
trying to build bigger barricades. That’s not actually the case (although that 
tends to be the kind of conflict that makes news). A very large number of 
NGOs make progress by working with industry and government.
Corporate cooperation
Environmental group representatives are often asked to sit on advisory panels 
for industry and business. These panels are composed of people who offer 
companies outside perspectives on their plans and actions. For environmental 
activists, being on advisory panels presents opportunities to help companies 
develop a greater understanding of the ecological impact of their actions.
The benefits of NGO–corporate partnerships go beyond advisory panels, 
however. Businesses are a link for NGOs to create policy changes, and the 
support of an NGO can help endorse the climate-friendly practices of a

Following the money
Although most NGOs are working toward a 
common goal, they’re not all on the same page. 
Some organizations give voice to the very few 
scientific skeptics. In those cases, determining 
where a group’s funding comes from can be 
educational.
The American Association of Petroleum 
Geologists (AAPG), for instance, gave a “jour-
nalism” award to Michael Crichton for State of 
Fear, a science fiction novel that painted global 
warming as a huge conspiracy. (We take a 
closer look at this book in Chapter 16.) Not coin-
cidentally, the AAPG’s research is often funded 
by the oil industry. Another group, the American 
Enterprise Institute (AEI), famously offered 
$10,000 to scientists to challenge the findings 
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change. Oil giant ExxonMobil funds the AEI.

247
 Chapter 15: Activists without Borders: Non-Governmental Organizations
business. With their comprehensive understanding of the causes of climate 
change, NGOs can offer industries real insight into problematic practices that 
have been causing major emissions. And businesses can often find practical 
(and economical) ways to implement greenhouse gas-reducing technologies 
and strategies. By bringing these two specializations (so to speak) together, 
industries can get a more holistic perspective on best practices for business 
and industry operations.
 
Some partnerships between NGOs and businesses, such as the following, have 
really helped reduce greenhouse gases:
 
 The Climate Group is an international organization made up of compa-
nies and government representatives to advance leadership on climate 
change, work with partners such as HSBC Holdings and Intel to improve 
management systems, save energy, set targets for reducing emissions, 
and make a profit while they’re at it.
 
 Conservation International partnered with Ford Motors to create 
the Center for Environmental Leadership in Business. The Center is 
dedicated to bringing in large corporate partners, such as Marriott 
International (the hotel chain), to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
engage hotel guests in rainforest conservation projects. Another partner 
is Starbucks, now working on a five-year climate change adaptation proj-
ect to support coffee-growing countries to protect the agricultural land, 
water, and forests that sustain the countries.
 
 The Pembina Institute in Alberta, Canada, has worked with companies 
such as Suncor in the oil industry to reduce their emissions.
 
 World Wildlife Fund International leads a project entitled Climate Savers, 
engaging companies such as IBM and Lafarge to reduce their carbon 
dioxide emissions. The goal is to deliver emission cuts equal to taking 3 
million cars off the road every year by 2010.

An NGO risks its credibility when it puts its name beside that of a business. 
NGOs are rooted in value systems and the values of their members. The World 
Wildlife Fund faced criticism when it partnered with Nike in 2001 because of 
the company’s labor policies, even though WWF was linked to Nike on only 
environmental issues. Likewise, corporations can stand a risk of being linked 
with strong standpoints that a partner NGO might bring to the media.
Government action
On national and international levels, NGOs are working with governments to 
fight climate change. In individual countries, many governments recognize 
and often draw on the expertise of NGOs — despite the fact that such groups 
often disagree with government policy and are working to change it.

248
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Governments and non-governmental organizations are naturally complemen-
tary to one another. NGOs are generally created to fill a gap that people have 
identified in government. Both the government and NGOs have a mandate 
to act in the best interest of the public, but NGOs focus on particular issues. 
NGOs aim to bring the voice of the public to the government.
 
The U.K. government and The Climate Group collectively launched the 
Together campaign. Together is an aptly named campaign for convincing 
people and businesses to make changes in their lives and operations. The 
Together campaign is already a third of the way to its goal of saving a metric 
ton of carbon dioxide for every household in London.
Internationally, large NGOs are very active, participating in every climate 
negotiation since the first meetings toward a global treaty began in 1990. The 
United Nations (UN) recognizes credible and well-organized NGOs as observ-
ers to global negotiations. The role of observer isn’t nearly as passive as the 
name may suggest; observers can speak at meetings, but they can’t vote on 
negotiated text for treaties.
In their speeches at these conferences, NGOs can ensure that the grassroots 
are represented and that the issues aren’t lost in any political maneuvering. 
They also meet regularly with the delegations of governments to discuss 
policy and political stances. To bring awareness to the public, NGOs com-
municate with reporters and greatly help focus the attention of the media on 
key issues. The collective work of these NGOs helps move the negotiations 
forward and puts pressure on the politicians at the table.
Banding together
From the earliest stages, the non-governmental 
organization (NGO) community realized the cli-
mate crisis would require a global solution. So, 
the NGOs formed their own global network, 
the Climate Action Network (CAN), which com-
prises more than 350 NGOs from over 80 nations. 
Through CAN, NGOs share information and strat-
egies to push for progress internationally, nation-
ally, and regionally.
You can check out CAN’s Web site at www.
climatenetwork.org. Individual member 
countries have Web sites, too, with useful links

Meeting This Generation
People under 25 years of age make up almost half of the world’s popula-
tion. That’s a big share, and because many of the major climate changes are 
projected to hit 50 years from now, youth groups have a special role in the 
climate change NGO world. Youth organizations can make a difference by 
educating their parents and larger community, by greening university cam-
puses, by pressing governments for change, and by promoting a low-carbon 
lifestyle.
The voice of a child
Probably no one was as young or as effective 
in a major United Nations Summit as a 12-year-
old girl from Vancouver, Canada, in the 1992 Rio 
Earth Summit. Severn Cullis Suzuki spoke to the 
delegates and reminded them that they should 
let their actions match their words:
Coming up here today, I have no hidden agenda. 
I am fighting for my future. Losing my future is 
not like losing an election or a few points on the 
stock market. I am here to speak for all genera-
tions to come. I am here to speak on behalf of 
the starving children around the world whose 
cries go unheard. I am here to speak for the 
countless animals dying across this planet 
because they have nowhere left to go. I am 
afraid to go out in the sun now because of the 
holes in our ozone. I am afraid to breathe the air 
because I don’t know what chemicals are in it. I 
used to go fishing in Vancouver, my home, with 
my dad until just a few years ago we found the 
fish full of cancers. And now we hear of animals 
and plants going extinct every day — vanishing 
forever.
I’m only a child, yet I know we are all part of 
a family, 5 billion strong — in fact, 30 million 
species strong — and borders and govern-
ments will never change that. I’m only a child, 
yet I know we are all in this together and should 
act as one single world towards one single goal. 
In my anger, I am not blind, and in my fear, I am 
not afraid of telling the world how I feel.
I’m only a child, yet I know if all the money spent 
on war was spent on finding environmental 
answers, ending poverty and finding treatises, 
what a wonderful place this Earth would be!
You are deciding what kind of world we are 
growing up in. Parents should be able to com-
fort their children by saying, “Everything’s going 
to be alright,” “It’s not the end of the world,” 
and “We’re doing the best we can.” But I don’t 
think you can say that to us anymore. Are we 
even on your list of priorities? My dad always 
says, “You are what you do, not what you say.” 
Well, what you do makes me cry at night. You 
grownups say you love us, but I challenge you, 
please make your actions reflect your words. 
Thank you.

Part V: Solving the Problem 
The importance of youth
Youth play an important and unique role. They can add a real sense of 
urgency to climate talks by stressing that the future — which may seem 
abstract to policymakers, industry, and the public — is very real for them. 
When scientists say, “This is what the world is going to be like in the year 
2050,” this young generation will live through those major changes. The 
threats are very real, and so is the need to immediately implement solutions.
The most useful element that youth bring to the table is optimism and high 
energy. They also invoke a sense of moral obligation in their elders. The 
involvement is genuine and fresh, and the lack of years of experience means 
that most youth see climate change with a sense of simplicity. When youth 
speak about global warming, they do so without employing numbing jargon 
or invoking complex political issues. What matters to them is their future, 
and they say so purely and simply.
From the White House to green initiatives
After leaving the White House, President Bill 
Clinton’s vice president, Al Gore, has become 
one of the world’s most prominent leaders in 
the fight against climate change — but Clinton 
has been very active in the field, too. The 
William J. Clinton Foundation, which has many 
relationships in Africa because of the work it 
does to combat the spread of HIV-AIDS, is 
increasingly moving to climate change work. 
The Clinton Foundation founded the Clinton 
Climate Initiative in 2006. The project aims to 
make large-scale energy reductions in order to 
cut greenhouse gas emissions.
The first phase of the business-based project 
is to work with 40 cities around the world in an 
initiative called C40, or the Large Cities Climate 
Leadership Group. The Clinton Climate Initiative 
is helping these cities reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions by creating tools, programs, and 
products that these cities can use. Local gov-
ernment, companies, building owners, and 
banks are all part of the game plan, retrofitting 
300 municipal buildings around the world with 
new, more energy-efficient designs and tech-
nology. Even private buildings — such as the 
Sears Tower — and more than 20 colleges and 
universities in the United States are undergoing 
energy-saving retrofits by partnering with the 
Clinton Climate Initiative. Even further, over 25 
companies have agreed to offer lower prices 
for their energy-efficient materials, systems, 
and other products — making them more widely 
accessible to more than 1,100 cities around the 
world through the Clinton Climate Initiative.

 Chapter 15: Activists without Borders: Non-Governmental Organizations
Groups that speak up
In just the past handful of years, coalitions and networks of youth organi-
zations working on climate change issues have formed. They’re sharing 
resources, organizing networking meetings between youth climate groups, 
and bringing youth representatives to UN climate change conferences. Here 
are just a few of those groups:
 
 The Australian Youth Climate Coalition (www.youthclimatecoalition.
org): This group is gaining strength and members quickly. It offers an 
educational program called Switched on Schools that helps high school 
students become active in their schools and communities, and it ran a 
campaign called Adopt a Politician, which encouraged youth to lobby 
their representative to act on climate issues leading up to the 2007 fed-
eral election.
 
 The Energy Action Coalition (www.energyactioncoalition.org): 
This group, of which Zoë is a member, brings together almost 50 youth-
run organizations across the U.S. and Canada. Not restricted to climate 
issues, the coalition has an array of foci, ranging from environmental 
justice and politics to community and education. It runs the Campus 
Climate Challenge program, which implements clean energy policies and 
emission reduction strategies at colleges and universities while raising 
awareness among students. This program already has more than 570 
campus groups involved.
 
 The Coalition was the brainchild of Billy Parish, who dropped out of 
Yale to do more important things, like save the planet. In 2007, the 
program was featured in Vanity Fair’s green issue, which earned Zoë and 
her team of colleagues a spot in the magazine’s photo spread — on the 
page before Robert Redford!
 
 Solar Generation (www.solargeneration.org): The youth arm 
of Greenpeace operates in over 20 countries around the world. 
They’re working on more than 120 solar panel installation projects in 
Switzerland, convincing Australian and American universities to begin 
installing on-campus solar panels, organizing skill-share energy and cli-
mate conferences, and participating in peaceful climate protests.
Getting Involved
Because many non-governmental organizations rely on volunteers, they’re 
always looking for people to join the team. If you’re looking to get involved in 
climate change issues, participating in an NGO is one of the best things you 

252
Part V: Solving the Problem 
can do. You can make a difference, especially as part of a larger group. As a 
member of an organization, you can rely on a support network of people who 
have experience addressing climate change issues; they can help you find 
where you can best contribute.
Seeking out groups
 
As we show in the section “Understanding What Non-Governmental 
Organizations Do,” earlier in this chapter, a wide array of NGOs exist. One’s 
bound to match your interests. Here are some suggestions about how to find a 
group that’s right for you:
 
 Attend a conference or event. These hotspots for meeting representatives 
from NGOs can help you find out about each group’s projects and how you 
can get involved.
 
 Contact your area’s environment department. Often, your provincial, 
state, or federal government’s department of the environment has lists of 
organizations working on climate change. (We share some government 
Web sites that can point you in the right direction in Chapter 22.)
 
 Show up at Green Drinks. Starting off as a good idea by a small group of 
friends in 1989 in the U.K., the event Green Drinks now occurs monthly in 
over 30 countries around the world, and in more than 350 towns and cities. 
People from academia, business, government, and non-governmental 
organizations who are working or interested in the environmental field 
meet up. It’s a great place to meet the inner circle of climate change–savvy 
people in your area and get connected with groups acting on the prob-
lem. Green Drinks is widespread across the U.S., the U.K., Australia, and 
Canada. Check out www.greendrinks.org for more.
 
 Surf the Web. The sidebar “Joining the climate change team(s),” in this 
chapter, lists the Web site addresses of some of the major NGOs. Many of 
these larger organizations have local chapters or can at least direct you to 
groups in your area.
Helping out
Organizations often have multiple campaigns going on at the same time and 
always appreciate help at any level. You can get involved in many ways, 
depending on your skills and interest.

253
 Chapter 15: Activists without Borders: Non-Governmental Organizations
Most organizations have Get Involved or What You Can Do sections of their 
Web sites that link directly to current projects for which they need help. Here 
are some examples of volunteer positions:
 
 Fundraisers: Raising money for organizations working on climate change 
ensures that they have funding to keep fighting climate change.
 
 Organizers: If you have strong organizational skills, many groups will 
be more than happy to have you help organize (or even take on organiz-
ing) public awareness events or conferences on climate change in your 
community.
 
 Public speakers: Speaking at events, big or small, is a help to organiza-
tions. Often, organizations offer training, so that you know just what 
to say. (In Chapter 19, we look at how you can get involved with the 
Climate Project, a group that trains people to offer the same presenta-
tion that Al Gore gives in the documentary An Inconvenient Truth.)
 
 Writers: Organizations are always on the lookout for people to write let-
ters to government, business, and industry representatives. Writers are 
also a big help in creating press releases and articles to get issues into 
the public eye through the media.
Joining the climate change team(s)
Many great groups are working on climate 
change issues. Some focus only on how to make 
religious buildings more energy efficient, some 
concentrate on greening schools. Some are 
active on a local scale in their own community 
or region, and others are taking it global. Here’s 
a tiny snapshot of major NGOs in Australia, 
Canada, the U.K., and the U.S. that focus on cli-
mate change:
  American Solar Energy Society (www.
ases.org): Active since 1954, this organi-
zation promotes and implements the use of 
solar energy, energy efficiency, and other 
renewable energy technologies. You can 
join a local chapter and receive guidance on 
installing solar energy in your home.
  Clean Air — Cool Planet (www.clea
nair-coolplanet.org): This American 
organization works with companies, 
campuses, communities, and science cen-
ters to cut greenhouse gas emissions and 
engage people in implementing their own 
climate solutions. This organization can work 
with you to join local groups, find the main 
problems that your area needs to deal with, 
build a plan, and then implement it.
  David Suzuki Foundation (www.david
suzuki.org): A large Canadian organi-
zation led by icon environmentalist David 
Suzuki, this group offers a Nature Challenge 
to members to reduce their carbon footprint 
and work together to reduce our emissions.
  Friends of the Earth (www.foei.org/):This 
organization has over 2 million members and 
5,000 local chapters in 69 countries. Members 
volunteer locally with chapters to reduce the

greenhouse gas emissions of their communi-
ties, and many members also get involved by 
responding to requests from the Friends of 
the Earth headquarters — such as writing 
to their government representatives on an 
urgent climate-related issue.
  Green for All (www.greenforall.org): 
This organization’s main campaign is to 
create an economy for green collar jobs in 
the United States, enabling people to make 
a living making the Earth more livable. Green 
for All provides volunteers with resources to 
campaign in their own communities for more 
environmentally friendly job opportunities.
  Greenpeace (www.greenpeace.
org/~climate): Greenpeace is a major 
international organization with many cli-
mate change awareness programs: You can 
sign up for a seven-step climate change 
challenge, or you can become a Cyber 
Activist — receiving online alerts of when 
and how to take action. Greenpeace accepts 
all kinds of volunteers; they work with the 
skills you have and fit you where you can be 
most effective.
  Sierra Club (www.sierraclub.
org): What began in 1892 as a club dedi-
cated to bringing people into the great 
outdoors to experience the wonder of 
nature has grown into one of the strongest 
environmental groups and advocates for bat-
tling climate change. You can join in Canada 
and the U.S. and belong to a local chapter 
or youth branch, go on outdoor outings, and 
volunteer for campaigns. You can find Sierra 
Club Canada at www.sierraclub.ca.
  Union of Concerned Scientists (www.
ucsusa.org): This organization, founded 
and staffed by scientists, promotes a 
high level of public understanding and 
practical science-based solutions towards 
a better world. Anyone can join and 
contribute to the discussions and research 
that shape the group’s reports and policy 
recommendations. The UCS has been active 
for over 35 years throughout the United States, 
addressing critical issues, such as climate 
change.
  World Wildlife Fund (www.worldwild
life.org/climate): WWF is active 
all over the world. When you become a 
member, WWF continually updates you 
on WWF climate campaigns and how you 
can get involved in international climate 
conferences, gives tips for making green 
changes at home, and offers partnerships to 
green your business. If you live near a WWF 
office, you can volunteer on-site, too.

N
ot too long ago, global warming was the exclusive domain of climatolo-
gists and environmentalists. Now that its effects are undeniable, it’s 
on everyone’s lips and getting serious exposure in popular culture. This is 
good news, as far as we’re concerned — the more people know about climate 
change, the greater the momentum for change.
But is any publicity good publicity? In this chapter, we take a close look at 
how the news and entertainment industries cover global warming and show 
how the science that we cover in Part I sometimes gets lost in the push for a 
good story.
Growing News Coverage
Once relegated to articles in science journals and the back pages of the news-
paper, global warming now merits cover stories in mainstream magazines, 
front-page stories in the papers, and feature reports on news broadcasts.
Although the number of climate change stories is increasing worldwide, the 
rate of growth is different from nation to nation. An Oxford University study 
revealed that the British newspapers offer far more stories on global warming 
than their U.S. counterparts. Check out Figure 16-1 to compare the increase 
in newspaper coverage on climate change from 2003 to 2007 in the U.S. and 
the U.K.

Max Boykoff. “Flogging a Dead Norm?” Area 39:4.
Without this coverage, public awareness of global warming wouldn’t be 
where it is today. But, as we cover in the following sections, you need to read 
those feature stories and watch those reports carefully, no matter where 
they’re published or broadcast, to ensure you don’t get misinformed.
Bias and balance: Distorting the story
#
#?
!
 
Because journalists are supposed to give both sides of a story, sometimes 
they actually create a bias in their reporting. In 2004, academics Jules and 
Maxwell Boykoff published a study of more than 600 randomly selected arti-
cles on climate change that appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The New York 
Times, Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post. Just over half the articles 
gave roughly the same amount of attention to competing views: the idea that 
humans contribute to global warming and the opposite claim that climate 
change is exclusively the result of natural fluctuations. The academics found 
that television coverage was split more evenly between the two perspectives, 
with 70 percent of television news coverage giving both sides equal airtime.
Although this “balanced” reporting might seem fair, the likelihood that 
humans are contributing to climate change is 95 percent certain, accord-
ing to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Giving both 
sides equal coverage creates the inaccurate perception that it’s an equally 

257
 Chapter 16: Lights, Camera, Action: The Media and Global Warming
weighted debate. Similarly, the Boykoffs’ study found that 78 percent of the 
articles were balanced in reporting competing views about acting on the 
threat — either act now, or wait and see. Again, though, the science over-
whelmingly advises people to act now.
Consider the source: Being an informed 
media consumer
You sometimes have to really work to figure out when something you read or 
see in the media is 100-percent true. But by being a careful media consumer, 
you can tell the difference between credible information and inaccurate 
reporting. Watch out for these key issues when reading articles or watching 
features about global warming:
 
 Questionable experts: Television news reports need talking heads, and 
newspaper articles require people who can act as sources — and plenty 
of people are willing to offer themselves as experts, with or without the 
knowledge required. A handful of “experts” always support the climate 
denier side of the argument. These pundits like media coverage and 
appear to have good credentials, but they may not actually do research 
on climate, they may receive funding from fossil fuel companies, or they 
may distort the work of others. Media-friendly experts who stress imme-
diate action on global warming can be problematic, too. Although they 
feel passionately about the issue, these individuals may communicate 
the wrong information by oversimplifying complex science or exaggerat-
ing global warming’s effects.
 
 You can tell whether or not these people are experts by checking to 
see whether the news story references any scientific research that the 
expert has actually had published in a peer-reviewed journal.
 
 Old research or evidence: If the report doesn’t mention the date of 
the evidence it’s citing, that’s a red flag — the evidence could be an old 
theory that has since been refuted. The documentary The Great Global 
Warming Swindle, for example, focused on solar cycles as a cause of 
global warming, using evidence from the 1980s that has since been 
largely disproved. (See the following section for more about this 
documentary.)
 
 Source of information: If a report references the IPCC, you can trust 
that information — as long as the writer or producer hasn’t misunder-
stood the words of the IPCC. In his novel State of Fear (HarperCollins), 
Michael Crichton quoted IPCC out of context a fair bit! (See the section 
“Bestselling Books: Reading between the Lines,” later in this chapter, for 
more about this book.) A scientist who has published and peer-reviewed 
articles offers another good source of reliable information.

Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
 Blogs and Wikipedia, on the other hand, are generally the least cred-
ible sources of information about climate change. Anyone can create 
or contribute to these Web sites. (Nevertheless, we look at a few of the 
most popular blogs in the section “Worldwide Warming: Climate Change 
Blogs,” later in this chapter.)
 
 For reliable online information, try government, non-governmental orga-
nization, and university Web sites. (We recommend ten of our favorite 
resources in Chapter 22.)
 
 Oversimplification: News reporters often simplify information to a 
point where it’s actually incorrect or over-exaggerated. For example, if a 
scientist says sea levels could rise by 13 to 16 feet (4 to 5 meters) if the 
Western Antarctic Ice Sheet collapses, a reporter might say the scientist 
has predicted this will happen. (Predicting and projecting are two differ-
ent things. A prediction is an assertion that something will happen, but 
a projection is an extrapolation of future events if current trends hold 
true.) Change the trend lines and the projection will change.
 
 Complex scientific issues don’t fare well in the land of the sound byte. If 
the article you’re reading or the report you’re watching offers extreme 
outcomes, check for further background information to ensure you get 
the whole story.
 
 Surveys: Surveys are a great way to gauge public opinion — if they’re 
accurate. When reading about a poll, check how many people were sur-
veyed. A small number of people (say, 50) doesn’t necessarily mean that 
the information is wrong, but the poll or survey results probably don’t 
reflect the greater population.
Science on the Red Carpet
Climate change is so hot that Hollywood studios are taking notice. And their 
stars are acting, as well — not just on-screen, but in their personal lives. But 
what’s the real story? How much truth is there in The Day After Tomorrow? 
How green — really — are those jet-setting stars? And can George Clooney 
make a difference by tooling around Tinseltown in an electric car?
Movies: Facts and (science) fiction
Although global warming is constantly gaining public attention, it hasn’t 
served as the subject (or even the backdrop) for many films. Because 
global warming poses a complex problem that requires complex solutions, 
it doesn’t make for the stuff of Hollywood fodder. For the most part, when 

259
 Chapter 16: Lights, Camera, Action: The Media and Global Warming
climate change has turned up on the silver screen, its portrayal has been sen-
sationalistic, setting the scene for science-fiction dystopias. Happily, some 
documentaries set the story straight, and some of the best work that’s being 
done on the screen is explaining the problem to kids, who will be on the front 
lines of climate change impact while they grow up.
Silver screen stories
Perhaps the most prominent fictional film that addresses global warming, 
The Day After Tomorrow (2004), is a well-intentioned movie that’s scientifi-
cally credible . . . for the first 15 minutes. The movie opens promisingly — the 
film’s hero, a climate scientist played by Dennis Quaid, briefs a world confer-
ence on his theory: When Arctic ice melts, the fresh water released will inter-
fere with the oceans’ thermohaline currents, slowing them down and leading 
to climatic disasters. (Chapter 7 discusses the actual computer modeling of 
this possibility.) The fictional U.S. vice president reacts realistically, demand-
ing to know who would pay the costs of Kyoto (see Chapter 11).
But after this believable beginning, the plot becomes completely driven by 
special effects, and the real science is lost in the (literal) deluge. We can’t 
deny the coolness of watching freak tornadoes obliterate Los Angeles, snow 
pummel New Delhi, and killer hail devastate Tokyo — but by the time a deep 
freeze destroys the entire northern half of the planet, we’re no longer noting 
scientific accuracy. Although special effects dominate the movie, the produc-
ers acknowledge the liberties taken and include useful interviews with scien-
tists in the DVD’s special features.
Science fiction films dominate the list of fictional movies that deal with global 
warming. In terms of quality, they’re a mixed bag:
 
 A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001): This post-disaster film takes 
place after all the polar ice caps have melted and most coastal cities 
are entirely flooded, pushing civilization inland. Although humanity 
might never see a robot with feelings, which is the subject of Steven 
Spielberg’s film, flooding of low-lying cities is a realistic possibility. If 
people keep producing emissions at the current rate, coastal waters 
could rise 8 to 24 inches (20 to 60 centimeters) by the year 2100.
 
 The Arrival (1996): This little-seen movie is heavy on suspense but light 
on science. It turns out that global warming is the work of aliens, who 
have come to Earth and are working secretly to transform the planet to 
suit their own needs.
 
 Waterworld (1995): Kevin Costner starred in the ill-fated Waterworld 
as a mariner sailing the Earth after global warming triggered flooding, 
which has covered almost all land. The only ground still above water, 
called Dryland, turns out to be the summit of Mount Everest. Sadly for 

260
Part V: Solving the Problem 
the movie’s credibility, the world doesn’t have enough water to flood the 
whole thing. The highest estimates of how far sea levels could rise from 
global warming max out at about 650 feet (200 meters). That’s a lot, but 
the Waterworld scenario would need something like 30 times that depth.
One rare exception to the special-effects-driven Hollywood take on climate 
change is Rob Reiner’s The American President (1995). This romantic comedy 
uses the climate issue as an effective backdrop without hitting a single false 
note on the science. The film depicts the unfolding love story between the 
president (a dishy widower played by Michael Douglas) and an earnest lob-
byist (Annette Bening) for a big, mythical environmental group. The lobbyist 
isn’t satisfied with the president’s commitment to cutting energy use by 10 
percent, even back in the mid-1990s. With no special effects required, the 
script stays relatively error-free and helpful — for example, when the presi-
dent gives his lover his phone number, it’s the actual White House line.
Documentaries
The most influential full-length movie on global warming to date is the docu-
mentary An Inconvenient Truth (2006), featuring former U.S. Vice President 
Al Gore. Building momentum through word-of-mouth and low-scale advertis-
ing, it was one of the year’s most successful films — an unheard-of feat for 
a documentary. The buzz grew even louder when the film walked away with 
the Academy Award for best feature-length documentary.
An Inconvenient Truth is based on Gore’s lecture presentations that high-
light big, catastrophic events that global warming may cause. Called a true 
horror film by some for the impact it has on viewers, it makes the scale of 
the problem clear to audiences — that the situation is way beyond such easy 
fixes as switching light bulbs. However, it does outline what individuals can 
do, and it definitely motivated many viewers. The movie essentially changed 
global thinking, moving climate change to the forefront of many people’s 
minds. To follow it up, thousands of “mini-Gores” are being trained to give 
the same presentation across the United States. Gore himself, along with the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), was awarded the Nobel 
Peace Prize in 2007 for his climate change work.
Another strong documentary is Too Hot Not to Handle (2006). The program 
covers the effects of global warming on the United States. It was originally 
aired on the U.S. television channel HBO and, like An Inconvenient Truth, is 
now available on DVD.

The Great Global Warming Swindle, screened in 2007 in the U.K., presents 
a far more contentious view of global warming, arguing that civilization’s 
impact on climate change has been overstated. Martin Durkin, the docu-
mentarian, claims that natural trends, such as solar cycles, cause global 
warming. (We talk about solar cycles’ contribution to global warming in 

261
 Chapter 16: Lights, Camera, Action: The Media and Global Warming
Chapter 3.) Many critics note, however, that scientific research has con-
firmed the impact of human activity on global warming with greater cer-
tainty than the film acknowledges. In fact, recent research determined that 
the sun’s activity has actually been decreasing since 1985, making it all but 
impossible that solar cycles are causing the planet’s warming. Chapter 21 
dispels some of the myths that this film presents.
For the kids (and adults, too)
You might think that global warming is unlikely subject matter for children’s 
entertainment, but a couple of recent kids’ movies have tackled climate 
change:
 
 Ice Age 2: The Meltdown (2006): This movie makes good-humored 
references to the natural Ice Age and warming cycles while touching 
on such current threats as flooding. Roger Ebert noted, “If kids have 
been indifferent to global warming up until now, this Ice Age sequel will 
change that forever.”
 
 Happy Feet (2006): This environmentally minded movie features pen-
guins who are dealing with the consequences of civilization’s encroach-
ment on the natural world. Although the movie doesn’t expressly 
address global warming, it does get kids thinking about the impact of 
society’s actions on the greater environment.
Following the stars
“Well, if Leonardo DiCaprio is doing it . . .” Okay, maybe you need more moti-
vation than that to get involved, but the power of the stars is undeniable. 
Many celebrities are using their high profiles to advance green living and 
advocate action on climate change. DiCaprio and others are speaking out, 
getting involved with climate change organizations, and practicing what they 
preach by making smart choices about cars, travel, and home retrofits. Not 
everyone can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on high-tech good-
ies, but everyone can do his or her part, and these stars deserve credit for 
making these choices and encouraging others to do the same.
 
The organizations that stars work with get a lot of press coverage and free 
publicity. Concerns exist about turning an urgent issue such as climate change 
into a pet cause — after all, a celebrity could be ill-informed, and the media 
would print his or her words anyway — but the benefits far outweigh any con-
cerns. Most of the time, the stars know what they’re talking about, and they’re 
genuinely concerned about the issue. In this kind of situation, the ideals asso-
ciated with celebrities (as they are so often in the media limelight) can influ-
ence people — and leaders — for the better.

262
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Leading lights
Here are just a few of the stars putting their celebrity to work:
 
 George Clooney: Twice named the Sexiest Man Alive by People maga-
zine, he just got sexier. He drives the ultra-mini, one-seat-wide Commuter 
Car Tango, and the Tesla Roadster, a top-of-the-line electric beauty.
 
 Leonardo DiCaprio: Climate change is a passion for this actor, who 
co-wrote and produced an environmental documentary, The 11th Hour. 
He also created the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation in 1998 to support 
a variety of environmental causes. DiCaprio sits on the boards of the 
National Resources Defense Council and Global Green USA. In his per-
sonal life, he has installed solar panels on the roof of his house.
 
 Jack Johnson: This professional surfer turned musician hosts an 
annual music festival close to his home in Hawaii with all the proceeds 
going towards the Kokua Foundation, which promotes environmental 
education.
 
 Willie Nelson: Following up his foray into marketing “BioWillie,” a blend 
of 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent regular diesel, the veteran coun-
try singer has thrown his support behind the not-for-profit Sustainable 
Biodiesel Alliance.
 
 Brad Pitt: Another former Sexiest Man Alive, Pitt is working with the 
Home Depot Foundation to build the first totally self-powering house as 
part of rebuilding New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
 
 Julia Roberts: The Pretty Woman star uses environmentally friendly 
products (including her kids’ diapers), has solar panels on the roof of 
her home, and uses bio-fuel in tractors and equipment at the family 
ranch. She’s a spokesperson for Earth Biofuels, Inc., and chairs its 
Advisory Board. She’s also involved in a community project to protect 
100,000 acres of wildlife habitat in New Mexico’s Valle Vidal.
 
 Arnold Schwarzenegger: Famous for his role as The Terminator, 
Schwarzenegger quit his acting job to run successfully for governor of 
California. He’s been a tireless advocate for action on climate change. 
(Check out Chapter 10 for some of his successes.)
Perhaps the most inspiring star is Robert Redford. Redford created Sundance 
Village, a haven for environmental art and conservation, on land he bought 
in the late 1960s in the heart of the Utah mountains. This initiative gave birth 
to the annual Sundance Film Festival, where An Inconvenient Truth had its 
world premiere, and the Sundance Channel, which broadcasts a three-hour, 
prime-time programming block titled The Green, devoted entirely to the 
environment. Actively fighting for conservation for decades, Redford has 
been described as a steadfast, well-informed voice on environmental issues. 

263
 Chapter 16: Lights, Camera, Action: The Media and Global Warming
He founded the not-for-profit Institute for Resources Management to try to 
bridge the gap between environmentalists and industry, hosted a Sundance 
conference on global warming way back in 1989, and started the conservation 
initiative North Fork Preservation Alliance to promote land stewardship.
Carbon offsetting and green travel with the jet set
One area where celebrities don’t often set a great example, however, is in 
their jet-setting ways. Some environmentalists give performers a hard time 
for the amount they travel by plane (often private), and for the extensive 
energy and fuel needed for major press junkets, music tours, and personal 
trips. Fortunately, many celebrities are beginning to carbon offset their air 
and ground travels — and the list is long, ranging from Tom Cruise to Nicole 
Kidman to Steven Spielberg. (Check out Chapter 17 for information about 
carbon offsetting.)
Although performing artists still tour, many of them try to make up for it 
along the way by fuelling their buses with biodiesel blends, carbon offset-
ting, and providing information on environmental issues to their fans. The 
leaders in this movement include Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Jack Johnson, 
Alanis Morissette, the Barenaked Ladies, and the Dave Matthews Band. In 
fact, the Barenaked Ladies have their own carbon-offset organization, dubbed 
Barenaked Planet.
Worldwide Warming: 
Climate Change Blogs
Blogs are booming. A blog (short for Web log) is an unofficial article or opin-
ion piece posted by an individual on the World Wide Web. Anyone surfing 
online can access the blog and respond by posting a comment. Most blogs 
aim to spur back-and-forth discussion among readers and with the author.
Here are a few of the most-read, climate-centered blog sites:
 
 AccuWeather (http://global-warming.accuweather.com): This 
blog offers global warming news, science, myths, and articles. It’s run by 
a senior meteorologist — at the time we wrote this, it’s Brett Anderson, 
a meteorologist with more than 18 years experience.
 
 Celsias (www.celsias.com): This blog offers practical solutions and 
climate change projects you can take on — such as responsible tourism, 
creating off-grid engines, and green home construction. The site’s slogan 
is certainly inviting: “Climate change is not a spectator sport.”

264

 Climate Ark (www.climateark.org): This blog features a timely news 
feed and focused discussion topics. It also includes links to many other 
blogs and climate resources.
 
 Climate Feedback (http://blogs.nature.com/climatefeedback): 
Sponsored by Nature magazine, this blog aims to raise questions and 
debate about climate change issues.
 
 Climate Progress (www.climateprogress.org): This blog focuses on 
U.S. politics, climate science, and — as its name conveys — progressive 
solutions.
 
 Desmog Blog (http://desmogblog.com): This blog hits on a wide 
range of climate change issues, with the goal of removing the “smog” of 
media hype.
 
 It’s Getting Hot In Here — Dispatches from the Youth Climate Movement 
(www.itsgettinghotinhere.org): The posts on this relatively new 
blog come from young people, from students to activists to professionals, 
posting on climate issues (mostly in the U.S. and Canada). Zoë posts on 
this blog, which now hosts more than 60 regular contributors.
 
 Real Climate (www.realclimate.org): Although some of the language 
on this blog is science-based, the climate scientists who post here are 
writing for the public. They aim to stick to scientific discussion and stay 
out of politics and economic issues.
 
 World Climate Report — The Web’s Longest-Running Climate Change 
Blog (www.worldclimatereport.com): This blog aims to give both 
sides of any issue being discussed. Despite this, Nature magazine has 
referred to it as the “mainstream skeptic” point of view. Translation: 
Read with caution!
Although not strictly climate-change-focused, TreeHugger (http://tree
hugger.com) and Gristmill (http://gristmill.grist.org) thoroughly 
cover global warming issues. Check them out for a slew of well-written articles.

Bestselling Books: Reading 
between the Lines
The number of books on climate change has exploded in recent years. From 
science to fiction, fear to solutions, and children’s books to adult titles, you 
have plenty to pick from.
True stories
A number of extremely well-written, non-fiction books on climate change 
have appeared in recent years. Some are long on the problem and short on 
offering solutions, which can be . . . well, a little depressing. Among the 
better-known titles are
 
 Field Notes from a Catastrophe, by Elizabeth Kolbert (Bloomsbury): 
Based on Kolbert’s articles for The New Yorker, this is a first-person jour-
nalistic look at the science behind and the impacts of climate change. 
Kolbert offers a well-researched and clearly explained account of the 
urgency of climate change while linking this to real places and stories 
from around the world.
 
 Heat, by George Monbiot (South End Press): Monbiot, one of the U.K.’s 
most respected journalists, offers a truly radical approach to avoid-
ing atmospheric tipping points. His writing reflects the immediacy of 
the climate crisis by demanding changes such as rationing energy use. 
Monbiot doesn’t believe that the range of policy options we describe in 
Part IV can get greenhouse gas levels low enough fast enough. He could 
well be right. (See Chapter 20 for more about Monbiot.)
 
 An Inconvenient Truth, by Al Gore (Rodale Books): Tied to the film 
of the same name (which we discuss in the section “Science on the Red 
Carpet,” earlier in this chapter), this current affairs book is the most 
accessible title on climate change currently available. Gore conveys his 
message with minimal text, using easy-to-read graphs to show the sci-
ence behind climate change.
 
 The Weather Makers, by Tim Flannery (Atlantic Monthly Press): 
Beautifully written, this book covers environmental science and issues 
in detail and depth. Though the content is a little overwhelming, 
Flannery offers solutions and a vivid writing style that draws you in. This 
book is a little frightening, but offers solid and entirely correct scientific 
information. (We talk more about Tim Flannery in Chapter 20.)

266
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
 The Winds of Change, by Eugene Linden (Simon & Schuster): Based in 
science and history, this book covers such overarching topics as the Gulf 
Stream, El Niño, weather patterns, and temperature. It gives you a very 
good overview of the chronology of climate change science, politics, and 
debate. It provides little in the way of solutions; however, it is well writ-
ten, interlaced with personal, historical, and political anecdotes.
Fiction and fairytales
Global warming makes a good story, tempting writers to use it as a basis for 
fiction. Like with movies (see the section, “Science on the Red Carpet,” ear-
lier in this chapter), however, the underlying science isn’t always presented 
properly. First, here are a couple of solid efforts:
 
 Floodland, by Marcus Sedgwick (Yearling): This imaginative book 
geared towards young teens made Zoë a little nervous. It’s about a 
young girl named Zoe who’s stranded in a rowboat in a flooded world.
 
 A Scientific Romance, by Ronald Wright (Picador): Inspired in part by 
H. G. Wells’s classic The Time Machine, Wright’s hero travels 500 years 
into the future, to a Britain transformed into a depopulated tropical 
jungle thanks to global warming. The author’s beautiful prose and deft 
description make the situation seem all too plausible.
#

One novel we don’t recommend for satisfying your climate change curiosity 
is State of Fear (HarperCollins), a 2004 thriller by Michael Crichton. The book 
depicts global warming as a conspiracy concocted by conniving environ-
mentalists. The story would be amusing if some people didn’t take the book 
seriously. The chair of a U.S. Senate committee invited Crichton to testify on 
matters surrounding research being used for public policy, and Crichton vis-
ited the White House to chat with President George W. Bush, who had read the 
book. The American Association of Petroleum Geologists (which gets funding 
from the petroleum industry) even gave him their annual Journalism Award.
Crichton says that State of Fear is the product of three years of research, 
offering detailed footnotes and an appendix to support his claims. 
Unfortunately, he misinterprets and misrepresents much of the science. 
Crichton even attacks real scientists through his novel, with one character 
claiming that a prediction made by eminent U.S. scientist Dr. James Hansen 
1988 about rising temperatures was off by 300 percent. Hansen himself has 
refuted that claim, showing that his projection was in fact remarkably 
accurate — an “inconvenient truth” for Crichton. (Check out Chapter 20 for 
more about Dr. James Hansen.)

Chapter 17
Taking the High Road
In This Chapter
 Getting around without a car
 Driving your car with fewer emissions
 Flying green through the blue skies
T
he area in your own life in which you can best limit greenhouse gas 
production is transportation. Any means of transportation that relies 
on fossil fuels adds greenhouse gases to the atmosphere — and currently, 
that’s just about every means of transportation. No wonder transportation 
accounts for about a quarter of all human-produced greenhouse gases.
People can and should push governments to change transportation policies 
to move citizens away from car dependence. Investments in mass transit 
within cities and efficient rail systems between cities can help many people 
make a choice to leave the car at home — and so can pricing policies that 
create incentives for low-carbon travel (a carbon tax sends a message to all 
of society that wasting fossil fuels wastes money). (Check out Chapter 10 for 
more about what governments can do.)
But the decision to walk to the corner store instead of driving, to buy a low-
emissions car rather than a big SUV, or to take the train rather than a plane 
is yours and yours alone. In this chapter, we look at the travel options you 
have, whether you’re making a quick jaunt or taking a long haul, and we high-
light the greenest choices.
Opting Out of Automobiles
Modern industrialized society’s cars are such a part of life that some people 
living in these societies may have a hard time imagining making even the 
smallest trip, such as a jaunt to the corner store, without them. But those 
little trips add up and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

268
Part V: Solving the Problem 
For every mile that you drive, a conventional car powered by an internal 
combustion engine releases one pound of carbon dioxide into the atmo-
sphere from the tailpipe. So, how do you get from Point A to Point B without 
adding to global warming? You have a lot of options, which we explore in the 
following sections.
Choosing where you live
Living close to mass transit or within walking distance of where you work, 
shop, and send your kids to school can help reduce your transport-related 
emissions. According to the American Public Transportation Association, 
Americans who live closest to public transportation drive 4,400 miles (7,081 
km) less a year than those who don’t have easy access to buses or trains. 
That’s a lot less exhaust.
Stepping in the right direction
Walking is the easiest choice for short distances. Walking can take just about 
as much time as starting up the car, waiting at traffic lights, and searching for 
a parking space — especially if you’re going only a few blocks. And your brisk 
jaunt will be carbon-free!
 
Depending on where you live, work, or go to school, you can probably use 
your feet for short trips every day, instead of driving. Try walking when you
 
 Run errands between places downtown (instead of driving from shop to 
shop).
 
 Go to lunch or dinner.
 
 Shop for food (bring a backpack or personal shopping cart, as well as 
your reusable shopping bags).
 
 Go to work if you live within about a half-hour walk.
 
 Go to the gym (bonus — you can skip your warm-up!).
Putting the pedal to the metal 
(of your bike, that is)
The bicycle is the most efficient mode of human transportation ever 
invented, consuming the least energy per mile traveled. Bikes are about 
5 times more efficient than walking and 50 times more efficient than cars. 

269
 Chapter 17: Taking the High Road
Bicycles take up far less room on the roads, reduce traffic congestion and 
smog, and improve their riders’ health. Biking does have it’s challenges — it 
may not be an all-season option in many places, and some trips are too long 
for a bike ride. Despite these limitations, riding a bike when possible, rather 
than taking a car, is the environmentally friendly choice. If you want a little 
more speed, opt for a moped or scooter (see Table 17-1 for information about 
scooter fuel efficiency).
Taking mass transit
Mass transit was defined in one of Elizabeth’s university classes as “the con-
veyance of persons in bulk.” Like the name suggests, it’s most efficient when 
it carries a large number of passengers.
Tips for top biking
If you’re interested in giving carbon-dioxide-
free transport a spin but don’t know a unicycle 
from a tandem bike, these hints can help set 
you on the right path:
  Choose a bike that’s right for you. Select 
the kind of bike you want based on your 
needs, your fitness level, the kind of riding 
you plan to do, and even the local weather 
and landscape. You have many different 
styles and sizes to choose from. Visit a bike 
store near you and talk to an expert about 
your bike needs.
 
 If you have to navigate the heavily used 
streets of some cities’ downtown areas, 
you might also want to get tires that are 
lined with Kevlar to resist punctures from 
broken glass.
  Get the proper accessories. After you have 
the bike, you need a helmet, a lock, a bell 
or horn, and lights so that cars can see you 
after dark. (In many places, the law requires 
you to have these items.)
  Chart out bike-friendly routes. If your city 
hasn’t yet adopted separate bike lanes or 
bike trails through built-up areas, you can 
get around more safely by following less-
busy streets that run parallel to the major 
routes.
  Take your bike on the bus. Progressive 
policies in some cities include allow-
ing bike riders to take their bikes on the 
bus — usually on a rack along the front of 
the bus. By taking a bike on public transpor-
tation, a bike rider can use that bike on the 
parts of the route that buses don’t service. 
The cities that have bike racks available on 
the bus, or attached to the front of the bus, 
encourage this intermodal (involving more 
than one mode of transportation in a single 
trip) approach to transportation.
  Be a concerned cyclist. If your city or town 
doesn’t offer dedicated lanes or paths for 
bicyclists, contact your local government 
and encourage officials to consider adding 
them.

270
Part V: Solving the Problem 
If you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and can’t walk or bike to 
your destination, mass transit is the best way to travel. You take up a seat on 
a vehicle that’s running anyway — so your trip costs almost nothing in terms 
of additional fuel consumption, emissions, and pollution.
Riding the rails
Trains are the best option for long-distance travel: they’re safer than cars and 
more comfortable and more fuel efficient than planes (cheaper, too, in most 
cases). Traveling by train can be much more fuel efficient than driving by 
yourself in your car, and the efficiency rises when more people get on board.
Added bonuses of taking the train, especially on longer trips, are that you can 
sleep in comfort (even in your own room), get up and move around easily, 
and use the extra time to get things done without a lot of distractions. (In 
fact, we wrote over half of this book on a train!)
 
When calculating your carbon footprint, train travel may seem like a high-carbon 
option. A higher carbon footprint for riding trains reflects low passenger usage 
in some countries because nearly empty trains can’t be very efficient. Ridership 
is much lower in Canada and the United States, for example, than in the 
European Union or Japan. Take the train to help improve your country’s results! 
(Flip to Chapter 18 for information on where and how to calculate your carbon 
footprint.)
Go car free . . . for a day
The first car-free days were held in Switzerland 
in 1974 in response to the 1970s Oil Shock. 
Major car-free events in Reykjavik, Iceland, 
and La Rochelle, France, in the late 1990s led up 
to the official creation of Car Free Day in 1998. 
To coincide with European Mobility Week, Car 
Free Day was held on September 22, and still 
is in many cities around the world. This grass-
roots movement has spread around the world. 
In some cities, the streets are actually closed to 
all traffic for the day.
Rome was one of the 150 cities and towns 
across Italy that went car free for a day in 2000, 
bringing life and a thorough sense of enjoyment 
to the people-busy streets. In other cities, cer-
tain neighborhoods close to traffic in a more 
symbolic celebration. Athens, Paris, Madrid, 
and Hamburg see a significant drop in cars 
on Car Free Day. Dublin closes three streets. 
Toronto celebrates largely in the Kensington 
Market area by closing the area to cars and 
bringing vendors out into the street, creating a 
social market atmosphere. The city of Bogota in 
Columbia has the largest Car Free Day, during 
which the municipal government completely 
restricts the use of vehicles that run on fossil 
fuels. Over 500 cities participate in annual car-
free days held on Earth Day, April 22.

 Chapter 17: Taking the High Road
Going the distance on the bus
Buses are a very environmentally friendly way to travel. The good old 
Greyhound (the North American bus service) could change its slogan from 
“Go by bus and leave the driving to us!” to “Go by bus and reduce your eco-
logical footprint!” (Not as good, we know — there’s no rhyme, but plenty of 
reason.)
Traveling by bus emits five times fewer greenhouse gas emissions than trav-
eling by plane. It’s among the most environmentally friendly ways you can 
travel. Bus routes often reach the most remote of communities, whereas 
trains tend to follow a main city route, stopping at only whatever lies in 
between.
Greyhound is the main coach bus service provider in the U.S., Australia, 
and Canada. Greyhound Australia runs its buses on the lowest-emission 
diesel fuel available and has spent over $10.5 million U.S. in the past year on 
upgrading to a fuel-efficient fleet of buses.
National Express is the go-to bus provider in the U.K. This company offers 
passengers a carbon calculator and is a proud member of The Climate 
Group’s We Can Solve It campaign, a global initiative to bring organizations, 
businesses, and individuals together to fight climate change.
Taking public transit
Depending on where you live, you might have a decent public transporta-
tion system — and if you do, hop on board! Although taking the city transit 
has been stigmatized as crowded and unpleasant, we can’t think of anything 
more unpleasant than helping heap carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
On track with global train travel
The popularity of train travel varies around 
the world. In Europe and Japan, train technol-
ogy is much more advanced than in the rest of 
the world — their trains are fast, convenient, 
popular, and affordable. Rail Australia is also 
well developed and functions in almost every 
region of the country.
In North America, trains are far less popu-
lar — and therefore far less efficient — but 
their popularity is growing, thanks to high gas 
prices and airport security concerns. Amtrak, 
the national U.S. passenger train company, 
offers the only train service in North America 
that comes close to the high-speed trains of 
Europe, the Acela. Travelers can get from New 
York to Washington, D.C., in about two and a 
half hours, making it a popular alternative to air 
travel. In Canada, where ViaRail operates the 
national passenger rail system, ridership has 
been growing steadily.

272
Part V: Solving the Problem 
The two main forms of public transportation in most cities are the bus and 
subway. Most buses run on diesel fuel, but many have already been upgraded 
or replaced with biodiesel, fuel cells, or electric motors, so they’re even more 
greenhouse gas–friendly. The subway (called the Metro, Underground, Tube, 
and so on, depending on where you are) runs on electricity, so its emis-
sions depend on the source of the electricity. Efficiency-wise, it’s at its best 
when fully loaded, like any form of mass transit. Adding to the subway’s fuel 
efficiency is the lower friction of train wheels on metal tracks, compared to 
vehicles that have rubber tires that run on road surfaces. The less friction 
the wheels encounter, the less energy they need to turn.
 
In the United States, mass transit use has hit a 50-year high, thanks to rising 
gas prices, according to the American Public Transit Association. In the past, 
even when gas prices dipped, many people stayed on board their cities’ buses 
and subways.
What You Never Learned in Driver’s Ed
Although not owning a car is the best thing you can do for the atmosphere, 
we understand that many people do need their own vehicles because of the 
way that many modern cities and societies are designed. If you do need a car, 
don’t feel guilty — and don’t think that you can’t help fight global warming. 
You can ensure your vehicle is as green as possible in several ways, from 
what you drive, to how you drive it, to how many passengers you bring along. 
And cars are improving in climate-friendly design, too, with new technologies 
on the horizon that will leave gasoline-powered cars in the dust.
Choosing a climate-friendly car
After the Oil Shock in the early 1970s, when oil prices skyrocketed, new gov-
ernment standards required passenger cars to become more fuel efficient. 
Unfortunately, in North America, that trend stalled: by 2006, personal vehi-
cles were actually less fuel efficient than the fleet of 20 years earlier.
The decline was due in part to the rise of a new beast on the road: the sport 
utility vehicle (SUV). The SUV, whose market share has soared since its intro-
duction, is a huge, heavy gas-guzzler in comparison to your standard pas-
senger car. The Sightline Institute, a Seattle-based environmental think tank, 
has estimated that an SUV with only a driver (no additional passengers) pro-
duces about 60 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than the per-person 
contribution of the average air flight. Classified as a light truck (which is why 
it doesn’t fall under tougher U.S. and Canadian fuel-efficiency standards for 

273
 Chapter 17: Taking the High Road
passenger cars), the SUV and its gas-thirsty kin — pick-up trucks and multi-
passenger vans — accounted for about half of the new-car market in the U.S. 
through the 1990s, although this number is falling because consumers are 
reeling from high gas prices.
In contrast, in Europe, Japan, China, and even Australia, saving fuel is much 
more a way of life. In most cases, governments have legislated greater fuel 
efficiency (or likely will, if car manufacturers don’t meet voluntary stan-
dards). But lifestyle also plays a role: Drivers in Europe, in particular, favor 
small vehicles that can more easily maneuver narrow streets, park in tight 
spots, and save on gas (which is much more expensive than it is in North 
America).

Although choosing a car within one of the more efficient categories in Table 
17-1 can help ensure that you waste less gas, fuel efficiency can vary widely 
within a category. Checking online at one of the following Web sites can steer 
you to the most fuel efficient vehicles within a particular class:

275
 Chapter 17: Taking the High Road
 
 Australia: www.greenvehicleguide.gov.au
 
 Canada: http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca
 
 United Kingdom: www.dft.gov.uk/actonco2 (click the Best on CO2 
Rankings link)
 
 United States: www.fueleconomy.gov
 
The more fuel efficient the car, the lower its emissions and the better it is 
for the environment. Usually, smaller cars are more fuel efficient. Ninety 
percent of the gas in a car is used not to move people around, but to move 
the car itself. Because the weight of the car is such a big factor, carrying 
two passengers uses about the same amount of fuel as carrying just one. So, 
going from one passenger to two basically doubles the efficiency of a car on 
a per-person basis.
Helping out the environment with a hybrid
The most efficient category of car is the hybrid. A hybrid is any vehicle that 
relies on more than one form of power. Train locomotives, for example, are 
diesel-electric hybrids. Although hybrids have been around for more than a 
century, they’re just picking up steam again in the car market. The hybrid’s 
high fuel efficiency is based on the fact that gas-powered cars waste a lot 
of the energy that they produce (close to 80 percent, in fact). For example, 
when you apply the brakes in a regular car, you actually work against the 
power of the engine. That power gets turned into heat that just dissipates 
into the air. Similarly, when you coast, the engine runs but doesn’t actually 
help propel the car. (Think of pedaling your bike while you rocket down a 
very steep hill — your legs might be pumping like crazy, but gravity’s moving 
you forward, not your legs.)
A hybrid, which has both a regular combustion engine and an electric engine 
under its hood, converts the energy normally wasted during braking or coast-
ing into electricity. It then uses that electricity to help propel the car when 
the car needs power again. The electric motor works on its own in low-speed 
driving conditions (conditions in which gas engines are least efficient). The 
gas engine kicks in and helps out when the batteries alone can’t provide 
enough power. So, the vehicle uses a smaller gas engine than a non-hybrid of 
the same size, further boosting its fuel efficiency.
 
In addition to having two separate engines (gas and electric), hybrids differ 
from conventional cars in other ways. Hybrids

276
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
 Carry a bank of batteries to store electrical power, not just the single 
one in a conventional car. The hybrid’s electric motor can charge the 
batteries, as well as draw energy from them.
 
 Include a sophisticated onboard computer that directs the transfers of 
energy whenever it sees an opportunity to save gas.
 
 Feature innovative drive trains in some models that further increase 
their efficiency.
 
 Display in real time how much gas is used, as well as the average gas 
usage per mile. This information helps drivers avoid moments of rapid 
acceleration or speeding; the displays tell drivers just how much gas 
they’re wasting when they put the pedal to the metal.
 
If you want to know what it’s like to drive a hybrid, you can give it a shot 
through most rental companies. After you try a hybrid, you might want to 
buy one. (After not owning a car since 1980, Elizabeth just became the proud 
owner of a hybrid car.) Just be prepared for that first stop sign, when you 
think for a second that the engine has died. The gas engine turns off when you 
brake because the car doesn’t need it to slow down or sit still. As soon as you 
need power, press the gas. Depending on the decision that the onboard com-
puter makes, the car may move silently forward on battery power, or you may 
hear the sound of the car engine using gas.
Driving on a dime: Ways to use less gas
Even if you’re not in the market for a new car, you can increase your own 
vehicle’s fuel efficiency by up to 20 percent just by giving your car regular 
tune-ups and using fuel-efficient driving skills.
 
Here are some ways to drive more efficiently:
 
 Turn off your engine when you stop your car for ten seconds or 
longer, and avoid turning on your engine before you need to. An aver-
age newer car uses about the same amount of gas in ten seconds as it 
does to re-start the engine. If you turn off your vehicle whenever you’re 
stopped for ten seconds or longer (when you’re stuck in a traffic jam 
or pulled over — not when you’re at a stop sign or a red light), you can 
easily save money and reduce emissions. And you also help out your 
vehicle.
 
 Extensive idling actually damages modern engines, and (contrary to 
popular belief) you can best warm up a cold engine in winter by driving 
it, not letting it idle. You can save on gas costs, as well: For every two 
minutes a car idles, it uses about the same amount of fuel it takes to go 

277
 Chapter 17: Taking the High Road
1 mile. By idling, you’re really going nowhere fast — especially because 
medical studies have linked car exhaust to asthma, allergies, heart and 
lung disease, and cancer.
 
 Opt out of the drive-through. Often, it takes less time to park the car 
and walk in than use the drive-through. With the money you have to 
spend on the gas you use while sitting and waiting, you could buy two 
sundaes rather than one. You can even join the local movement in many 
towns and cities to ban drive-throughs.
 
 Keep tires fully inflated to the recommended pressure. Keeping your 
tires pumped up increases your car’s miles per gallon.
 
 Remove the roof rack during seasons in which you don’t use it and 
remove the mud flaps behind the wheels during the summer. Believe it 
or not, removing these add-ons improves the aerodynamics of your car 
and reduces drag when driving, which increases your miles per gallon.
 
 Don’t stomp on the brake or the accelerator unnecessarily. You really 
waste a lot of gas when you gun the engine, and when you immediately 
cut off the momentum you had. Try to avoid road rage moments!
 
 Drive at the speed limit, rather than over it. Fuel use, carbon dioxide 
emissions, and speed are directly related. According to a report by the 
European Transport Safety Council, simply enforcing the speed limit of 
70 mph (113 km/h) in the U.K. would cut emissions by 1 million metric 
tons each year, and lowering that speed limit to 60 mph (97 km/h) would 
cut emissions by another 0.9 tons each year.
 
 Take all that junk out of your trunk. Extra weight means your car uses 
more gas.
 
 Keep up with maintenance. The more smoothly your car runs, the less 
gas it uses.
 
 Run the air conditioning only when you need it. Most cars use engine 
heat to warm a car, but it takes extra engine power to cool it down — 
enough to lower the miles to the gallon you’re getting. (Of course, rolling 
down your windows significantly increases drag if you’re on the high-
way, so use this tip when on shorter or inner-city trips.)
 
 Drive in the highest gear possible. In a manual-shift vehicle, driving in 
a high gear reduces the need to step on the gas peddle, and it also takes 
stress off of your engine.
 
All the tips in the preceding list also apply to running your boat, motorbike, 
scooter, dirt bike, four-wheeler, jet-ski, snowmobile, golf cart, and so on. Even 
though cars and trucks produce most transportation-related emissions, get 
into the habit of driving everything more efficiently.

278
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Sharing a ride
According to many estimates, sharing a vehicle can do more to reduce 
carbon emissions than avoiding air travel (we talk about air travel in the sec-
tion “Joining the Real Mile-High Club,” later in this chapter). You can share 
a car by offering to drive other people (or hopping into someone else’s car) 
or by owning a piece of a fleet of vehicles. Either way, you’re driving less, 
which means you’re responsible for fewer greenhouse gases entering the 
atmosphere.
Carpooling
Carpooling, when individuals share a ride to the same destination, takes a 
load off you because you don’t have to drive every day. Office carpooling, 
when a group of people share a ride into work, is the most common kind, but 
countless other possibilities exist. You can carpool in almost any situation, 
such as driving kids to practices after school. Sharing driving duty with three 
other parents, dividing up who drives the children which days, can make 
your life three times easier. Even rock stars are helping their fans get into the 
act: The Dave Matthews Band sets up carpooling to and from its concerts via 
its Web site.
Many highways and major roads in and around cities have special lanes des-
ignated for cars that have more than one person in them — a huge benefit 
during rush-hour traffic. Some cities offer special parking lots where carpool 
members can meet up.
 
The Internet has made ride-sharing easy. A lot of regions have their own sites 
dedicated to connecting drivers with passengers (which you can find through 
a Web search), and some social networking sites offer ride-share applications. 
Through these online services, you can meet the people with whom you plan 
to share a ride and settle how you want to split the costs for the trip.
 
A car that has five riders is actually almost as efficient per person as a moped 
carrying one person or someone’s share of a commuter train trip.
Car sharing
You can also share wheels through a car-share program, in which a group of 
people collectively own a fleet of cars as a cooperative. Each person pays for 
a membership and schedules his or her use of a car. Joining a car-share pro-
gram can cost a lot less than renting a car, and you don’t have to worry about 
any of the maintenance hassle of individual ownership. Even better, you often 
drive low-emission cars in this kind of program. Car-share programs exist 
around the world. To find one near you, check out www.carsharing.net/
where.html.

 Chapter 17: Taking the High Road
Watching for upcoming car technologies
Auto shows used to be the domain of people interested in the power under-
neath a car’s hood, hungrily eyeing prototypes that promised more horse-
power in the engine. Now that manufacturers are flaunting greener models 
and exploring ways to get cars off oil entirely, auto shows attract more 
people simply looking for a practical, low-carbon car. At recent car shows, 
automakers featured hydrogen, electric, and even compressed-air cars — all 
potential alternatives to fossil-fuelled vehicles.
Using rocket science
Cars of the future may use the same technology that sends rockets into outer 
space — combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, with water 
vapor as the only emission.
Although the scientific breakthrough behind this idea of a fuel cell happened 
almost 200 years ago (Sir William Grove invented a gas voltaic battery in 
1845), it may take a few more decades before fuel cells can run the cars on 
the road. Several wrinkles need to be ironed out first:
 
 Cost: Current fuel-cell technology is very expensive — about three times 
the cost of conventional fuels.
 
 Electricity: Producing and compressing pure hydrogen for fuel-cell cars 
(and other applications for fuel cells) requires electricity. If that electric-
ity is produced by using fossil fuels, then you don’t significantly reduce 
the emissions tied to your car.
 
 Infrastructure: Companies argue that they need support from govern-
ments to widely build hydrogen fueling stations, which these cars need 
to stay running. One of the first fuel-cell infrastructures is the Hydrogen 
Highway linking Vancouver and Whistler, British Columbia, built for the 
2010 Olympics.
Cars that run a conventional internal-combustion engine by burning hydro-
gen, rather than (or in addition to) gas, face similar problems. Although man-
ufacturers are road-testing the first of these hydrogen cars, they admit that 
these cars are probably too expensive for the average driver and that fueling 
stations are too few and far between.
Because hydrogen doesn’t occur naturally in the pure form that these cars 
need, the fuel company has to produce it from a hydrogen-containing mol-
ecule, such as water, ethanol, or a fossil fuel. So, a whole wind farm could 
provide the energy for the process to separate the hydrogen from water (a 
carbon-free solution), or power from a coal-fired plant could separate the 
hydrogen from methane. Hydrogen isn’t necessarily a clean, green energy 
source — but it can be.

280
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Currently, hydrogen fuel cells aren’t employed on the road, although some 
forklifts use the technology. Public transit may take to the hydrogen high-
way first because those vehicles refuel in central locations. Many cities have 
already acquired hydrogen buses or are testing the technology. For private 
cars, hydrogen technologies await their commercial breakthrough and, in the 
meantime, remain controversial because of the amount of energy required to 
produce fuel cells in the first place. In the long term, civilization is likely to 
use fuel cells in a wide range of applications beyond vehicles, including pow-
ering buildings.
Electrifying vehicles
The electric car runs by using rechargeable batteries, so it doesn’t need any 
fuel on board at all. It was invented in the mid-1800s, and by the beginning 
of the 1900s, one-third of all cars were electric. However, they rapidly lost 
popularity after gas-powered cars adopted electric starters (no more hand-
cranking) and the motoring public started ranging farther afield — to places 
where you couldn’t recharge an electric car.
#

!
 
The 1973 Oil Shock renewed interest in the electric car, and so did growing 
concerns about air pollution and greenhouse gases. You may remember in 
the mid-1990s that everyone seemed to be talking about the electric car as 
the car of the future. So, what happened to those great plans? Many argue 
that car and oil companies purposely killed plans for electric cars because of 
the potential threat they represented to the booming oil industry. The docu-
mentary Who Killed the Electric Car? goes into this connection in great detail. 
Electric car technology still exists, but it needs to find its market.
Capturing hydrogen from water
Hydrogen has the potential to be an ideal fuel 
because people can find it in something the 
Earth has a lot of — water, which is composed 
of hydrogen and oxygen. To separate the hydro-
gen and oxygen atoms from each other, two 
electric currents are put through the water: one 
negative and one positive. The charges of these 
currents cause the chemical bonds between 
the hydrogen and oxygen atoms to separate.
Every atom in chemistry has a charge. Hydrogen 
is positive and oxygen is negative. They act just 
like two magnets that pull together because 
they’re attracted to the opposite electrical 
charges, which are stronger than the bond 
between each other. The hydrogen and oxygen 
each bubble up as a gas, allowing pipes to cap-
ture the hydrogen and compress it into a fuel 
cell. Many developments are underway to find 
more efficient ways to make hydrogen fuel cells. 
Currently, the process is too energy-intensive to 
be widely used.

281
 Chapter 17: Taking the High Road
 
Like with the hydrogen fuel-cell car, the electric car is only as green as its elec-
tricity. If the electricity originates from coal-fuelled generators, for example, 
these cars are still responsible for a great deal of greenhouse gas emissions.
Traveling on air
Air power could be the most revolutionary car technology if someone can 
bring it into mass production. Because the fuel is air, only air comes out of 
the tailpipe. Electricity pumps air into the car’s tanks until it reaches a level 
of pressure high enough to run the engine, instead of combusting gas. (So, 
the source of the electricity is important, just like for hydrogen and electric 
cars, which we discuss in the preceding sections.) The Mexican govern-
ment has already agreed to buy 40,000 compressed-air cars to use as taxis in 
Mexico City, in a bid to reduce its infamous air pollution.
Joining the Real Mile-High Club
Plane travel is extremely polluting: Scientists believe that greenhouse gases 
released by aircraft at higher elevations actually do more damage than emis-
sions released at the earth’s surface. Several factors — empty seats, numer-
ous connections (and therefore numerous take-offs and landings) in one 
flight, and even the weather — make air travel the most variable and carbon-
intensive means of transportation in terms of greenhouse gases produced 
per passenger, per mile. So, when you can’t avoid flying, make lower-carbon 
choices about how to do it.
Choosing when to fly
The most energy-intensive part of the flight is take-off, so a non-stop flight is 
best — only one take-off. For the same reason, short flights are less efficient 
than long flights. You get all the way up there only to hang out for half an 
hour before coming back down! You can most easily replace a short-haul 
plane trip with a bus or train ride. When you factor in airport check-in time 
and the fact that many train stations are in the heart of cities’ downtowns, 
you probably don’t save any time at all by flying.
Traveling guilt-free by using 
carbon offsets
Carbon offsetting is a way of sort of undoing the emissions from your air 
travel by financially sponsoring an activity that reduces emissions elsewhere 

282
Part V: Solving the Problem 
by the same amount. So many people have decided to carbon offset that a lot 
of organizations, both for-profit and non-profit, have sprung up to serve the 
market.
Some examples of offset projects that you can put money into include the 
following:
 
 Retrofitting homes in low-income communities with energy-efficient light 
bulbs
 
 Installing solar panels in a community that would otherwise get its elec-
tricity from a coal-fired plant
 
 Investing in a small wind-power company so that it can feed into the 
electricity grid
Carbon-offsetting organizations are usually Web-based. Most sites offer an 
online carbon calculator that helps you determine just how much carbon 
dioxide your trip will release into the atmosphere. Figure 17-1 shows you 
what a typical online carbon calculator looks like.

The carbon-offsetting option to plant trees is not as effective as most other 
offset projects. Planting trees is effective, but in terms of global warming, 
those trees won’t start to soak up significant amounts of carbon dioxide for 
25 to 30 years, and trees are vulnerable to carbon loss because of forest fires. 
For quick results — which you want to focus on because of the pressing 
urgency of climate change — choose energy projects that implement either 
efficient infrastructure or technology, or that involve a switch to a renewable 
energy source.
Although they tend to be based in the U.K. or the U.S., most carbon-offsetting 
programs serve people in any country and can calculate the price in vari-
ous currencies. The programs tend to calculate your emissions differently 
because each program gives differing weights to various factors. We list the 
most credible and reliable sites in Table 17-2.

You’ve probably heard the saying, “Think globally, act locally.” Well, it 
doesn’t get any more local than your home, where you can make plenty 
of changes that help reduce your carbon footprint. Don’t worry — we’re not 
going to suggest that you give up your worldly possessions and go live in a 
log cabin (although if you do, be sure that the logs are from sustainable for-
estry practices). In fact, some of the biggest changes you can make, environ-
mentally speaking, are some of the smallest.
In this chapter, we take a look at how you can give your life a green makeover.
Home, Carbon-Free Home
By making changes right at home, you can help do your part to cool down 
the planet. Reducing energy use is the name of the game because most 
energy (even electricity) involves greenhouse gas production, and a lot of 
great practices and technologies can help. (Check out Chapter 6 to see how 
homes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.)

286
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
To kick off your own adventure in greater energy efficiency, set up a home 
energy audit, in which a trained expert goes through your home to tailor 
advice to your needs. In some countries, the government supports energy 
audits with rebates or other incentives. Either way, the investment in expert 
advice is well worth it — if you follow the audit advice, you can save much 
more money than you paid for the audit in a short time.
 
You can best reduce home-related emissions immediately by using less 
energy. Not only does conserving energy cost you nothing, it actually saves 
you money on your utility bills while saving the planet. “Waste not” is the core 
principle: Don’t use it if you don’t need it. The following sections offer conser-
vation tips to help you cut back on your home’s energy consumption.
Heating and cooling
Taken together, heating and cooling constitute the two largest uses of energy 
in your home — so they’re also the places you can potentially save the most. 
Turning up your air conditioning and lowering your heat by just 3.5 degrees 
Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) saves more than a metric ton of carbon diox-
ide in one year.
 
Automated temperature control can make your home comfortable while 
reducing energy use. Programmable thermostats enable you to preset tem-
perature levels, and getting one for your home is about the best investment 
you can make to help save on cooling and heating costs. You set the tempera-
tures for various periods during the day and night, as well as for the week and 
weekends. Not only do you not need to remember to change the settings, the 
program can make sure the temperature is comfortable by the time you get up 
in the morning or return to the house at the end of the day.
Heating
You can start saving money and reducing greenhouse gas emissions right 
away by getting a more efficient heating unit. If you can access natural gas, a 
high efficiency gas furnace makes a good investment. If you’re stuck on home 
heating oil, you can still make a major leap forward in energy efficiency by 
investing in a modern and more efficient unit. Better yet, switch your system 
to propane, a heat pump, or even a high-efficiency, wood-pellet system. Have 
an evaluator come in to assess your current heating system and see what 
changes you can make to your home.
Day-to-day habits make a big difference, no matter what heating source you 
use. Keep the heat turned down when you’re not home. (But remember to keep 
your home warm enough to prevent frozen pipes.) In fact, even when you’re 
home, try a lower temperature than the standard 72 degrees Fahrenheit (20 
degrees Celsius). Just throw on some warm and cozy clothes — over your 
natural-fiber long underwear, natch — instead of hanging out in your skiv-
vies with the heat going full blast. That change drops your winter heating bill 

287
 Chapter 18: Making a Difference at Home and Work
instantly. At night, you can drop the temperature even more. Your body cools 
off by about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) when you’re sleeping. 
So, you can keep your house 3.5 degrees cooler at night, and you won’t even 
notice while you dream about sugarplums and wind turbines. For even greater 
savings, turn the heat way down at night, invest in flannel sheets, and pile on 
another blanket or two.
Cooling
Increasing reliance on air conditioning has completely changed the electric-
ity sector. Air conditioning runs on electrical power. It removes heat from 
the air in the house, dissipates the heat outside, and circulates the cooled air 
inside the house. Winter used to be the time of greatest demand for electric-
ity, but that’s now shifted to summer.
 
Cooling systems don’t have to run on electricity or consume it greedily, how-
ever. Here are a few low-tech and low-emission options that can help you keep 
your cool:
 
 Opt for natural ventilation. Natural ventilation involves the movement 
of air through and within a house. A well-designed home allows for cross 
breezes that keep air circulating. You can help the breeze out by using 
electric-powered fans, which require far less electricity than air condi-
tioners. By moving the air around, they make you feel cooler by about 7 
degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius). You can also use fans in the winter 
to recycle the warm air near the ceiling and keep the house more comfort-
able.
 
 Plant deciduous trees to provide shade. Trees can reduce air-conditioning 
needs by 25 percent. (And, as an added bonus, trees also absorb carbon 
dioxide.)
 
 Some state utilities in California actually plant trees around private homes 
for free to help reduce electricity demand. Many cities now have urban for-
estry programs to plant street trees at low or no cost to the homeowners, 
and some not-for-profit groups offer advice and low-cost trees for planting 
in back or side yards.
 
 Keep your curtains closed during the day and open at night. By following 
this curtain suggestion, you block out the day’s sunlight (while you are out 
of the house) and benefit from natural nighttime cooling.
 
 Consider a dehumidifier if you live in a humid climate. Dryer air feels 
much cooler.
 
 Plant a roof garden, if you can. The natural insulation that a roof garden 
provides offers another way to reduce air-conditioning use by 25 percent. 
You can even use that garden to grow your own veggies.
 
 Paint your roof white. White roofs substantially reduce the need for air 
conditioning because it reflects rather than absorbs the sunlight and 
heat.

288
Part V: Solving the Problem 
If you feel like you can’t get by without air conditioning, avoid central sys-
tems, which cool your entire home. Opt for room units and buy the most effi-
cient ones possible. By using room units, you can cool just the room you’re 
in, instead of needlessly cooling every room, regardless of whether anyone’s 
in them. And you don’t need to cool an empty house. Leave your air condi-
tioner off, or on a warmer setting, if you’re not home.
Drafts
Any cracks and crevices in your home increase its greenhouse gas emissions 
by reducing its efficiency. If hot air is streaming from your home in the winter 
and cool air is escaping in the summer, your heating and cooling systems 
have to work overtime.
 
Check for air leaks in your home on a windy day by lighting an incense stick 
(any scent will do) and holding it up to any spot that’s a possible air path to 
the outside, such as an air duct, window, electrical outlet, or plumbing fixture. 
If the sweet-smelling smoke blows horizontally, you have a leak that you need 
to seal.
Sealing up your home
Here are a few tips to keep your home from losing any warm or cool air:
 
 Look for entrance doors, cat doors, and even mail slots that don’t close 
all the way or that don’t totally seal. Getting those fixed up is cost-efficient 
and can really help conserve energy.
Pump it up: Heating and cooling from the ground
Ground source heat pumps are an effective way 
to help heat and cool your home while seriously 
reducing your carbon footprint. Geothermal 
heating and cooling uses the steady tempera-
ture of the ground to heat and cool your house. 
These pumps draw their heat (or cold) from 
under the earth, which holds a steady tempera-
ture year-round below 8 feet. The air that a heat 
pump pulls from the ground isn’t that warm, but 
it is warmer than the outside air in the winter 
and cooler in the summer. The steady tempera-
ture of the ground is used as a source to pump 
heat either into or out of your home, working 
the same way that your refrigerator works. The 
technology is called a compression cycle, but 
only the refrigerant, not air, is compressed. You 
can even capture and redirect the excess hot 
air produced from heating and cooling to help 
heat your water.
Ground source heat pumps aren’t cheap, unfor-
tunately, often costing about twice the price of 
a comparable furnace. That initial cost pays 
off in the long run, however; you get energy 
savings of anywhere from 30 to 60 percent. 
Because heat pump technology is complex, 
these systems need to be installed by qualified 
contractors.

289
 Chapter 18: Making a Difference at Home and Work
 
 Open and close the door right away when you’re going into and out of 
the building.
 
 Invest in good curtains and keep them snugly closed at night in the 
winter to keep in the warmth.
 
 Check the weather stripping around doors and other openings every fall, 
replacing or upgrading it, as needed.
 
 Check the chimney. If you have a fireplace in your home, the chimney 
is a great escape route for heat. Seal off the chimney completely if you 
don’t use the fireplace. If you do use it, be sure to close the damper 
when it’s not in use. Even better, install a fireplace insert or wood stove 
in the opening. Either option gives you a dramatic improvement in 
energy efficiency because most of the heat that a conventional fireplace 
produces goes straight up the chimney.
Getting the most from your windows
Many homes lose efficiency through their windows. Replacing old windows 
with new and more efficient ones may be worth doing, but if you need to pri-
oritize, you’re probably better off improving your home’s insulation and the 
efficiency of your furnace first. (An audit is so important because it informs 
you where your efforts can make the biggest difference.)
 
When shopping for energy-efficient windows, look for these characteristics:
 
 Double paned: Two panes of glass, separated by a gap, increases a win-
dow’s insulation value while providing the same clarity.
 
 Gas-filled: Gas between the panes of glass acts as extra insulation.
 
 Self-sealing: Soft rubber, which runs along the edges of the window, 
acts as a seal when the window is shut so that absolutely no air sneaks 
through.
 
 Energy label: Often, windows are marked with an Energy Star or Energy 
Saving label to show that they meet efficiency standards. (Check out 
the “Appliances and electronics” section, later in this chapter, for more 
about these labels.)
You don’t have to replace your windows to make them more efficient. You 
can seal drafty windows simply by caulking them. Another winter sealing 
option for cold climates involves covering the inside of the window with 
clear plastic. You can pick a kit up at any hardware store, and all you need is 
a hair-dryer (hopefully, an energy-efficient one) to finish off the application. 
Or, for a higher cost (that’s still less than replacing the window), you can use 
removable indoor or outdoor storm windows.

290
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Insulation
You can conserve energy by improving your home’s insulation. Insulation is 
material that slows the escape of heat from your house in winter and keeps 
the heat out of your house in summer. It comes in many different forms — 
the most common include fiberglass batts (sheets), foam board, and cellulose 
or fiberglass loose fill. Insulation is usually installed during construction. 
Traditionally, it went only into the attic, but more modern houses are insu-
lated between the walls when they’re built. Insulation can especially make an 
energy difference if you live in a climate that has extreme temperatures, hot 
or cold. With enough insulation, a building may not even need a furnace.
The U.S. Home Energy Guide suggests that you check the following spots to 
ensure they’re insulated, listed in order of importance:
 
 Attic
 
 Ceilings under unheated spaces
 
 Exterior and basement walls
 
 Floors over unheated spaces
 
 Crawl spaces
Insulation is measured in R-values (called RSI-values in Canada), such as R-40 
or R-25. R-values go up to 60, with better insulating ability the higher the 
number. The R-value recommended for your house depends on what kind of 
climate you live in. You can probably best determine your insulation needs 
by having an energy audit, but in the United States, you can use the Zip-Code 
Insulation Program (www.ornl.gov/~roofs/Zip/ZipHome.html). This 
Web site determines the most practical level of insulation for your home, 
based on where you live and your type of heating.
 
Depending on where you need it, adding or upgrading insulation can be a 
complicated job requiring specialized equipment and skills. You need to take 
into account vapor barriers and other considerations. Gaps reduce the overall 
effectiveness of the insulation, and so does packing insulation in too tightly. 
Also, you need to make sure that your home is properly air sealed before you 
insulate — ensuring there are no cracks or spaces in your exterior walls for 
drafts to get through. Finally, some types of insulation in older houses contain 
materials that are potentially toxic if disturbed. If you decide to tackle the 
work yourself, be sure to do the required research and take the necessary 
precautions.

Appliances and electronics
Out with the old, in with the new — new, energy-efficient wonders, that is. 
Household appliances and other products have become incredibly energy 
efficient over the last several years. In many cases, the newer an appliance is, 
the less fossil-fuel consumption it triggers. Making the right decisions today 
doesn’t just lead to immediate savings, it can save energy for the next 10 or 
20 years. Many national governments have set up national energy standards 
for appliances. For many other products, federal standards don’t exist, but 
ENERGY STAR can help.
ENERGY STAR was introduced by the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) in 1992 as a voluntary, market-based partnership to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions through superior energy efficiency. Today the ENERGY STAR 
label is on more than 50 different kinds of products, on new homes, and on 
commercial and industrial buildings. Products, homes, and buildings earn the 
right to display the ENERGY STAR by meeting strict energy-efficiency criteria 
set by the EPA.
The savings have been tremendous. In 2007 alone, Americans, with the help 
of ENERGY STAR, saved more than $16 billion on their utility bills while 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those from 27 million vehi-
cles. For more information on ENERGY STAR, go to energystar.gov.
Figure 18-1 shows the label to look for in the U.S. when shopping for energy-
efficient appliances. Hunt for ENERGY STAR in the U.S., Australia, and 
Canada, and for Energy Saving (of the Energy Saving Trust) for the U.K. Both 
labels are bright blue and both detail their energy-use in relation to a regular, 
non-energy-efficient appliance, making it easy to see the savings before you 
even make a purchase.

Part V: Solving the Problem 
Making the right choices when replacing major appliances can make your 
energy bill drop immediately.
 
Always check the energy rating. Just because an appliance is new doesn’t 
mean it’s energy efficient; some new appliances are still energy hogs.
Fridge and freezer
Refrigerators can be true energy hogs. Happily, Energy Star and Energy 
Savings fridges use about 40 percent less energy than any model made before 
2001. Here are a few suggestions for making your fridge even more efficient:
 
 Locate it away from warm appliances, such as the oven, stove, and 
dishwasher.
 
 Make sure you open the fridge door only when needed and seal it tight 
when you close it. (You can test your fridge’s seal by closing the door on 
a piece of paper — if the paper stays, the door is sealed.)
 
 Set the temperature in your freezer at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (–17 degrees 
Celsius) and the fridge at about 35.5 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 
degrees Celsius) to keep things cool.
 
When you buy your new energy-efficient fridge, don’t keep the old one in the 
basement. Get it properly recycled, which safely removes its cooling liquids to 
avoid releasing ozone-depleting substances.
Dishwasher
You may be thinking that a dishwasher is a wasteful extravagance, but 
believe it or not, you can use a dishwasher without guilt. A study by the 
University of Bonn, in Germany, found that washing a full load in the most 
energy-efficient dishwasher, such as those with the Energy Star and Energy 
Savings labels, uses half the energy (from hot water use) and one-sixth the 
water that washing the dishes by hand does. Ensure that you choose the air-
dry option, avoid the pre-rinse or rinse-hold options, and sit back while the 
machine does your work, confident that you’re doing the atmosphere a favor!
Still, we include a lot of caveats before endorsing a dishwasher! Overall, if 
you wash a sink full of dishes by plugging and filling the sink (so that you 
don’t waste water), hand-washing saves energy. If you must have a dish-
washer, buy the most energy-efficient model and don’t run it until it’s full. 
Remember not to run your dishwasher until after peak energy demand — 
wait until the last thing at night to switch it on. Peak times are when the elec-
trical generating units in your area are straining to meet demand. Shifting use 
to off-peak times allows the generating station to run more efficiently and, if 
coal-burning, burn less.

293
 Chapter 18: Making a Difference at Home and Work
Washing machine and dryer
The most common washing machine model is the top-loader. Unfortunately, 
these models aren’t that efficient, using more water to wash your clothes 
than front-loading washers. Top-loading machines are also less efficient at 
spinning, meaning that they make your dryer work harder. Although front-
loading machines are more expensive, the investment can pay off in energy 
savings, not to mention the reduced environmental impact.
 
To be truly sure your washer is green, buy ENERGY STAR or Energy Savings 
washers, which use about 50 percent less energy than other models, and up to 
22 fewer gallons of water per full load.
Unfortunately, you can find very few eco-savvy dryers. Most dryers use about 
the same amount of energy. You can save some energy by buying a model 
that has a moisture sensor option; the dryer automatically turns off after the 
clothes have dried. The best option, however, is low-tech: Try a clothesline, 
which is quite “eco-chic” these days.
#
#?
!
 
Clotheslines are banned in some communities because people think they’re 
unsightly. If you can’t hang your clothes out to dry in your community, you 
can call your elected representatives to complain.
Multimedia electronics
These days, just about any electronic device comes in an energy-efficient 
version. Here are some bigger electronics that are available with low-energy 
ratings:
 
 Televisions: LCD screens are the most energy efficient; the least are the 
plasma screens larger than 50 inches. (Plus flat-screen TVs use nitrogen 
trifluoride [NF3], a greenhouse gas with warming properties 17,000 times 
more powerful than carbon dioxide. The popularity of flat screens has 
created a new climate risk. NF3 was not covered in the Kyoto Protocol.)
Turn off “instant on”
Many appliances, such as televisions, video 
game systems, and portable stereos, offer an 
“instant on” feature, coming to life the moment 
you press the power button. What “instant on” 
really means, however, is “never off.” These 
devices drain a constant stream of electricity 
so that they can leap into action when you need 
them. Although the trickle of power that they 
use may seem trivial, an average household 
can reduce electricity consumption by as much 
as 15 percent by sidestepping this feature. Plug 
your “instant on” appliances into a power strip, 
and when they’re not in use, turn the power 
strip off. (An even simpler option? Just unplug 
the appliances when you’re not using them.)

294
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
 Computers: You can find energy-efficient models in desktops and lap-
tops, but laptops take far less power, using only a tenth of the electricity 
drawn by a desktop.
 
 Sound systems: Including amps, speakers, and large stereo systems.
 
More careful computer use can save a huge amount of energy at home or at 
the office. First, turn your computer off — much of the energy that comput-
ers use is wasted because you leave them on at night, over weekends, and 
even for extended periods of inactivity during the day. If you must leave your 
computer on, at least turn off the monitor, which consumes a big chunk of the 
energy it uses.
Lighting
The light bulb you grew up with, the incandescent bulb, is soon to be a thing 
of the past. This energy-inefficient artifact is being phased out all over the 
world, in favor of energy-saving alternatives. The U.S. government has com-
mitted to phasing out incandescents over the next 12 years; the Australian 
government plans to phase out the bulbs by 2010.
The most common energy-saving light source is the compact fluorescent 
light bulb. It uses one-quarter of the energy that a regular bulb does to pro-
duce the same amount of light and can last up to ten years. Over its lifetime, 
assuming the electricity it uses comes from a coal-fired plant, one bulb pre-
vents (literally) a metric ton of carbon from entering the atmosphere.
#
#?
!
 
These compact fluorescent bulbs contain a trace amount of mercury. At the 
end of their useful life, you can’t just throw them in the garbage, you have to 
handle them as hazardous waste to avoid the minute amount of mercury in 
the bulb escaping into the landfill. (Each region has different regulations on 
how to handle hazardous waste — check with your local government for more 
information.)
The next generation of energy-efficient lighting will be LEDs (light-emitting 
diodes). These lights draw very low power and also last a long time, without 
the disposal problems of compact fluorescents. The technology is advanc-
ing rapidly, and when prices fall, people can start using them to light their 
homes. Many homeowners have already invested in LEDs in the form of low-
energy-consuming Christmas lights.
Keep an incandescent light bulb in a box in the attic so that you can show 
your grandchildren what a light bulb used to look like.

 Chapter 18: Making a Difference at Home and Work
Warm waters
According to Australia’s Department of Energy, an average house using an 
electric water heater produces about 4 metric tons of greenhouse gas annu-
ally; a natural gas heater produces 1.5 metric tons. You can cut back on how 
much energy your water heater uses by making some simple fixes:
 
 Wash laundry in cold water. More and more detergent brands come in 
a “cold water” version.
 
 Turn your water heater thermostat down. Set the thermostat on your 
water heater a little lower; you don’t really need your taps to go to 
“scalding,” do you?
 
 Insulate your water heater. Invest in an insulating jacket for your hot 
water tank to save on heating costs; the jacket prevents heat intended 
to heat your water from escaping. Check with the equipment or fuel sup-
plier for options.
 
 Install a low-flow showerhead. Many areas offer showerhead exchange 
programs.
If you want to make bigger changes, consider a solar water heater. You, as 
an average homeowner, can get this technology, and although it’s expensive 
initially, it saves you money over the lifetime of the unit. The sun’s warmth 
preheats your water and vastly reduces the amount of fossil fuel energy you 
need to use to take a steamy shower. In fact, depending on your hot water 
consumption and the local climate, solar water heaters can provide about 60 
percent of your annual water heating needs. Most solar water heaters need 
an auxiliary heater (natural gas or electric) to ensure that you can meet your 
hot water needs when it’s very cloudy or the days are very short.

Tankless (also known as on-demand) water heaters are another energy-
efficient option. Instead of storing hot water (and wasting energy keeping it 
hot until it’s needed), a tankless heater works only when you turn on the hot 
water. This kind of water heater is much more energy efficient than the con-
ventional storage heater and can provide savings of up to 75 percent on your 
water heating bill. They work well in tandem with a solar system, acting as a 
back-up for situations when your solar-powered heater doesn’t have enough 
juice stored to heat up your home’s water.
Green Developments: Building 
or Renovating
Whether you’re starting from scratch or renovating, major construction 
offers you the chance to really make your home energy efficient and carbon 
friendly. Keep the following elements in mind when working towards a 
low-energy and climate-friendly home (and check out Green Building & 
Remodeling For Dummies, by Eric Corey Freed [Wiley] for a whole book’s 
worth of information on this subject):
 
 Hire an eco-friendly architect. If you’re planning to use an architect, 
look for one who’s LEED accredited. LEED stands for Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental Design, and is a system launched by the U.S. 
Green Building Council, which sets standards for buildings’ energy effi-
ciency and environmental stewardship.
 
 Install automated systems. Many new technologies help you to reduce 
your energy use. We rave about programmable thermostats in the sec-
tion “Home, Carbon-Free Home,” earlier in this chapter. Another system 
allows you to turn off every light in the house with the push of one 
button on your way out the door.
 
 Be sun-smart. Build the longest side of your house facing south (or 
north, if you’re down under), and include well-insulated walls on the 
opposite side to capture and store heat in the winter when the sun is 
low in the sky. Having a lot of windows on the south side of your house 
helps, too. In the summer, this orientation actually helps keep your 
house cool because walls facing east and west are less exposed to the 
strong heat of the rising and setting sun. But for summer protection, you 
need a roof overhang on the south exposure, and the south windows 
need shades. (We talk about using the sun’s energy to heat your home in 
Chapter 13.)
 
 Plant trees. Keep or plant as many trees as possible on your property. 
Trees transpire (release water into the atmosphere), which has a cooling 
effect, adding to the benefits of their shade.

297
 Chapter 18: Making a Difference at Home and Work
 
 Landscape smartly. Manicured, green-carpet lawns are among the most 
wasteful practices of modern civilization. The water that is used to keep 
it growing and green, and the mowers that are used to cut it back down, 
both require a lot of energy. Consider alternatives, such as a clover 
lawn; it grows only an inch high and stays green all year. You can also 
reduce your lawn’s energy consumption by relying on the rain or collect-
ing rainwater from rain troughs on your roof.
 
 If you want your lawn to be extra environmentally friendly, keep it trim 
with a push mower, rather than the electrical or gas-powered alterna-
tives. You can also avoid using fertilizers on your lawn — the production 
of fertilizers releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas over 300 times as 
heat-trapping as carbon dioxide.
 
 Go underground. Build part of your house underground. Whether it’s 
for a multi-use basement or the main floor, the ground can help moder-
ate temperatures.
 
 Investigate alternative building materials. People are discovering new 
ways of building or going back to old ways that are far friendlier to the 
environment. Forests are one of the world’s key carbon sinks, so instead 
of using wood to frame your house, think about insulated concrete 
forms (ICFs). They make a house 30 to 50 percent more energy efficient 
and save hundreds of trees. But if you’re worried about the impact of 
concrete, which takes huge amounts of energy to produce, you might go 
even further and consider building with walls of straw bale or (in hot, 
dry climates) rammed earth.
 
 Lighten up on materials. Kitchen “must-haves” such as granite counter-
tops come at a huge energy cost to quarry, cut, and haul. But newly fash-
ionable concrete countertops might be even worse because concrete is 
an energy hog, taking lots of power to be made. Look instead for funky 
alternatives, such as recycled glass or sorghum-fiber laminate. Rather 
than using hardwood for floors, people are rediscovering old materials 
such as cork, linoleum, and natural-fiber carpeting, as well as cool new 
floor materials such as bamboo.
 
 If you do use wood, ensure that it’s Forest Stewardship Council certified, 
which means the forests are grown and harvested without soil damage 
or clear-cutting. (Refer to Chapter 14 for more about sustainable forestry 
practices.) And keep in mind that a veneer (thin layer) of hardwood over 
environmentally-friendly plywood is a much greener option than a solid 
piece.
 
 Recycle and reuse. Most home building materials are recyclable or 
reusable. When renovating, be sure to save salvageable materials. If you 
can’t reuse them, you can often find collection programs in cities that 
take materials such as doors and windows. Building with recycled or 
reused materials prevents energy from being used to produce the same 
thing new from raw materials. You can even buy recycled paint now.

298
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
 If your city has a Habitat for Humanity chapter, they probably run a 
salvaged materials resale store. One clever architect managed to build 
a fabulous little “scrap yard” house in Kansas for only $50,000, using all 
recycled and reused materials.
If you’re really committed to building a home that isn’t a drain on energy 
systems, you might want to consider building a zero-energy home — one that 
isn’t just highly energy efficient, but produces energy to feed into the grid. 
The goal of these homes is to produce as much power as they use, or even 
more. Governments in Canada, the U.K., and the U.S. are providing support 
for new techniques to create zero-energy homes, which are already a reality. 
One house built in Colorado by Habitat for Humanity has already met the 
zero-energy standard over a year of operation.
Powerful Changes: Renewable Energy
Cutting back on energy consumption in your home is great, but chances are 
very good that the energy you’re still using isn’t renewable and is producing 
greenhouse gases. Although people need to encourage their governments to 
explore sustainable energy sources (which we discuss in Chapter 13), you 
don’t need to wait to use cleaner power.
You can benefit from renewable energy in your home today:
 
 Generate the energy yourself. How much generating your own energy 
costs depends on where you live and whether your government offers 
incentives for retrofitting your home. Solar, wind, and geothermal heat-
ing and cooling technologies are becoming more widely available for 
home use. Currently, these costly units take a long time to realize any 
energy savings, but their prices may drop with higher production and 
technological advances.
 
 Buy renewable energy directly. You can bring energy straight to your 
home from an independent power generator, as opposed to the general 
service provider for your region. Your energy is still delivered through 
the same electricity grid, but you’re bringing renewable energy into the 
grid to replace non-renewable energy sources. You get total indepen-
dence from fossil fuels, but you can use this option only if you have a 
clean energy services provider in your area.

299
 Chapter 18: Making a Difference at Home and Work
 
 Buy renewable energy indirectly. Renewable energy from clean, emissions-
free sources (such as wind power and low-impact water power) often costs 
more to produce than other alternatives (see Chapter 13). You can opt to 
pay a premium for your power to cover the cost of that sustainable energy. 
Your household energy consumption is still metered, but your payment 
goes to supporting renewable projects only, rather than the mix of genera-
tion sources that feeds into the grid. It’s essentially the same as carbon off-
setting (which we discuss in Chapter 17), but for your home.
Here’s a list of Web sites where you can find information about green power 
in your area and how to purchase it, either directly or indirectly:
 
 GreenPower (Australia): This site links you to renewable energy pro-
ducers near you. (www.greenpower.gov.au)
 
 UKGreenPower (United Kingdom): This program allows you to type in 
your postcode and see what options are available in your area. (www.
ukgreenpower.co.uk)
 
 The Green Power Network (United States): This U.S. Department of 
Energy Web site outlines what’s available for your state. (www.eere.
energy.gov/greenpower)
 
 Pollution Probe (Canada): This non-governmental organization has a 
consumer guide to the green energy market in Canada that gives options 
by province and territory. (www.pollutionprobe.org)
Home, home in the hill
Fewer houses are greener — literally — than Dr. 
Bill Lishman’s. His home outside of Blackstock, 
Ontario, Canada, is a grassy hill, covered with 
lush gardens. Dr. Lishman designed his home 
to be underground, using the earth as insula-
tion. This alone makes the house just about as 
energy-efficient as you can get, but Dr. Lishman 
didn’t stop there. The entire house is a testa-
ment to efficiency, using as little energy as 
possible.
Although underground, the house’s interior is 
remarkably bright. Large sky lights in every room 
and white curved walls allow the light to reflect 
throughout the house, eliminating the need for 
artificial lighting (until nighttime, that is). Two 
sunrooms peak out of the hill and act like green-
houses during the day, growing warm in the sun. 
Air ducts carry the warm air from the sunrooms 
into the rest of the house.

report of its construction, visit www.william

Part V: Solving the Problem 
Cutting Back on Waste
Modern civilization throws out too much stuff, and that waste is affecting the 
climate. The U.S. produces the equivalent of 4.6 pounds (2.1 kilograms) of 
waste per person every day. That number is a little lower in the U.K. — about 
3.1 pounds (1.4 kilograms) per day — but it’s risen 9 percent in nine years. 
That garbage sits in landfill sites, producing methane gas, one of the most 
serious greenhouse gases. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more about methane.) 
Add to that the fuel burned in transporting trash to the site and the energy 
exhausted to create that unwanted stuff, and humanity has a real problem on 
its hands. Happily, people have the power to remedy the situation by making 
some adjustments to their lives.
 
Some communities offer limited recycling or composting options. If yours is 
one of those, try calling your local government and asking if they have any 
plans to expand these programs. Write a letter to your mayor or the editor of 
your local paper. If you don’t demand action, who will?
Producing less garbage
Aim to produce zero garbage. It shouldn’t be too hard: You can recycle or 
compost about 90 percent of what normally gets tossed in the trash. And 
sadly, a lot of what people do throw out they didn’t need in the first place. Did 
you know 25 percent of all food that U.S. households buy gets thrown out?
 
You can cut back on non-recyclable, non-organic waste in the following ways:
 
 Plan meals. When you know exactly what you’re going to eat for the 
week, you’re unlikely to buy more than you need. Avoiding food-related 
excess cuts down on both food waste and garbage, reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions.
 
 Reuse containers. Avoid disposable plastic bags for your lunches and 
leftovers, opting instead for sealable containers that you can use over 
and over. (Be careful, though, to use non-plastic containers so you don’t 
get nasty chemicals leaching into your food.) Not using disposable bags 
cuts back on fossil fuels used to make that plastic, saves the energy used 
(and emissions created) from making the bags, and reduces emissions 
by producing less waste. As an added bonus, you save money.
 
 Avoid individually packaged products. A lot of products now come 
prepackaged for individual use. Sure, they’re convenient, but they’re 
not worth it in the long run. You pay more and create a whole lot more 
waste. Instead of going for the individual packages, buy in larger quanti-
ties and create your own individual portions in reusable containers.

301
 Chapter 18: Making a Difference at Home and Work
 
 Buy in bulk. At many natural food stores, you can buy not only food but 
washing detergents and shampoos in bulk. Save and reuse the contain-
ers for bulk purchases.
 
 Avoid disposable bottles and cans. When possible, buy products in 
refillable containers — but be sure to get them refilled! (Check out 
Chapter 5 to see how much energy goes into making aluminum cans.)
 
 Avoid ordering take-out. Driving your meal to your home, the waste 
from the disposable containers, and so on — the problems with take-out 
are many. If you do order take-out, ask what kind of packaging the res-
taurant uses to find out whether you can recycle that packaging.
 
 Try not to buy on impulse. All it takes is a pause to think about why 
you’re buying something — more often than not, you don’t really need 
the product, and it just ends up in the garbage, contributing to the 
global warming problem.
Recycling
Recycling saves energy: It takes much less energy to melt down an aluminum 
can to make another can than to process the raw materials to make a can 
from scratch.
Most materials are recyclable, but what you can recycle depends on where 
you live. You can call your city or town, or visit its Web site, to find out what 
you can recycle in your area, as well as what gets picked up on the curb 
versus what you have to drive to the depot yourself. Here are the materials 
most commonly recycled in city centers:
 
 Aluminum: Rinse aluminum cans and foil that you want to recycle.
 
 Glass: You often have to sort the glass by color (green, brown, and 
clear). Wash jars and remove their labels. Many countries give money 
for certain glass containers, such as beer, wine, and soda bottles.
 
 Paper: Separate newspapers, magazines, and cardboard from regular 
paper and flatten boxes. If grease-stained, pizza boxes go in the garbage.
 
 Plastics: Plastics are generally categorized by numbers — including plas-
tic bags. You can usually find these different numbers on the bottom of 
the containers. Check which numbers your city or town collects. Many 
cities and towns don’t yet recycle plastic bags.
 
 Tetra-packs: You can recycle juice boxes and cartons used for milk, 
juice, and even wine. Just rinse and flatten them.

302
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
Throw only recyclables into the recycling bin. If your city takes only number 
1 to 5 plastics, don’t put in number 6 hoping it’ll just get mashed in with the 
others. Workers at the plant see that misplaced item and often toss your 
whole bag in the garbage — which is more efficient than sorting through your 
mistake.
Where you can recycle these things depends on your area. If you have curb-
side recycling, you can recycle as easily as you can toss something in the 
garbage. Unfortunately, not all cities collect recycling yet. You may have to 
bring your recyclable products to recycling bins, which you can usually find 
at your local dump.
Composting
When you put food waste in a garbage bag, you create the perfect condi-
tions for methane to form because when organic material decomposes in the 
absence of oxygen, it generates that potent greenhouse gas. If you compost 
that material — enabling it to break down into nutrient-rich material that 
you can use as fertilizer — you stop methane production, keep bags out of 
rapidly-filling landfill sites, and (best of all) create a wonderful substance that 
nurtures plants. What’s not to love about composting?
Home gardeners have been composting their vegetable peels, plant trim-
mings, leaves, and grass clippings for ages. Now, many municipalities are 
providing compost curbside pick-up or central drop-off locations. Municipal 
programs typically accept a wider range of compostable materials than a 
home compost pile, including meat and fish products, bones, bread, pasta, 
paper towels and tissues, pet wastes, and disposable diapers. These addi-
tions can go a long way to making yours a zero-waste home, and the munici-
pality can use (sometimes even sell) the compost they produce.
If you live in an apartment, or if your city doesn’t pick up your compost 
on the curb yet, you can opt for vermicomposting. If the name makes you 
squirm (like it still does for Zoë), it’s fitting — vermicomposting literally 
means composting with worms. A little creepy, but, with fans like Martha 
Stewart, it’s a good thing. The little guys simply live in a bin, munch on your 
food scraps, and send those scraps out the other end as compost. They’re 
quite happy to compost your scraps, and they break down your food rather 
quickly. You just need a bin with air holes, soil, and the worms. Or you could 
opt for a worm condo, like the one that Oprah has — a fancy stacked and 
aerated bin.

303
 Chapter 18: Making a Difference at Home and Work
Chewing on Food Choices
It’s time to choose a low-carb — low-carbon, that is — diet. Your food 
choices have a surprisingly large impact on greenhouse gas emissions. 
Researchers have estimated that the average American creates 2.5 metric 
tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year by eating, which is actually more 
than the 2 metric tons each U.S. citizen generates by driving.
Avoiding the big chill
The fewer cooled or frozen foods you buy, the less you contribute to the 
energy needed to keep all those fridges, freezers, and refrigerated trucks run-
ning. When it comes to prepared foods — ready-made meals, pizza, bread 
dough, pastries, and so on — simply avoid the frozen option. Frozen foods 
just add to the energy bill.
Sometimes, you need to chill food to prevent spoilage, reduce waste, and 
avoid extra trips to the store. And in the middle of winter, you may have 
trouble deciding whether to choose the fresh vegetable trucked from Texas 
or the local one that was frozen in September. The best option may be to go 
without your spinach or broccoli in winter, and instead get some local root 
crops stored without freezing.
Opting for unprocessed
Think of the extra energy it takes to turn apples into applesauce or soybeans 
into veggie sausages. Processed foods also need much more packaging, 
which uses energy and adds to solid waste streams. And the processed food 
you’re buying probably isn’t locally produced, which means that it had to be 
transported to you from afar, creating even more emissions.
Buying the raw ingredients for food and making it yourself cuts back on 
greenhouse gases. As Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore’s Dilemma 
(Penguin), recommends, “Shop at the edges of the grocery store [where they 
keep the natural food], not the middle.”
 
Fresh and unprocessed foods are healthier for you, containing less salt, sugar, 
and mysterious chemical ingredients that no one can pronounce.

304
Part V: Solving the Problem 
Minimizing meat
If everyone in the developed world gave up meat from cud-chewing animals, 
such as beef and sheep, they would do more to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions than giving up their cars, some research says. No wonder experts 
recommend eating less meat to help reduce greenhouse gases.
Even without going vegetarian, reducing intake can help. The average person 
needs only between 50 and 100 grams of protein a day, depending on his or 
her weight and activity level. You can get that from a range of foods, includ-
ing fish and chicken (both easier on the environment than beef), eggs, tofu, 
beans, and nuts.
 
When choosing fish, do careful research to ensure it was harvested by using 
practices that support sustainability.
Here are a couple tips to help you move to a greenhouse gas–reduced diet:
 
 Take a day or more each week off from meat. Some of the world’s tasti-
est cuisines use little or no meat. Explore vegetarian cookbooks (we rec-
ommend Vegetarian Cooking For Dummies, by Suzanne Havala [Wiley]) 
and vegetarian-cooking Web sites for ideas.
 
 Choose wild or pastured meat over meat from animals in feedlots. In 
feedlots, the animals are forced to consume huge quantities of grain. 
Raising organic beef on grass rather than feed involves 40 percent fewer 
greenhouse gas emissions and consumes 85 percent less energy. You 
can find grass-fed beef, as well as bison, in some markets (renowned cli-
mate advisor Louise Comeau makes a mean bison chili). Get game such 
as venison, moose, and caribou if you can find them available locally.
Bottled water: All wet
Bottled water is an environmental disaster. It’s 
taken from sources hundreds and often thou-
sands of miles away from where people will 
consume it, requiring enormous energy expen-
ditures for shipping and removing the resource 
from its natural setting. It adds billions of bottles 
to the solid waste stream every year — 40 mil-
lion a day, for example, in the U.S. alone. And 
its health benefits are questionable, to say the 
least: The water coming out of the tap in your 
municipality has been treated to meet far higher 
standards.
If you don’t like the taste of chlorine in treated 
water, use a filter system. Also, if you live in an 
older part of your community, ask local water 
officials about testing your supply for lead, 
which was used in older supply pipes. You may 
need to have those pipes replaced.

305
 Chapter 18: Making a Difference at Home and Work
Buying local produce
You’re probably used to finding fresh vegetables and fruits all year long, 
shipped from around the globe. But food that comes from close to home is so 
much better — it doesn’t need to be transported, it helps local food produc-
ers, and it’s higher in nutrients.
When you’re grocery shopping, find out where the produce was grown and 
try to stick to nearby suppliers. Better yet, get your food directly from the 
source: Many cities and towns have farmers’ markets, often on weekends, 
where you can get locally grown food that’s guaranteed to knock your 
taste buds away. Check out great resources online for The 100 Mile Diet 
(www.100milediet.org) — all about the benefits of eating locally grown 
and produced foods.
Food isn’t the only thing you can buy from a local source to cut back on 
greenhouse gas emissions. Out-of-season flowers are shipped by air or grown 
in greenhouses. Stick to what’s in season and field-grown locally (you can 
find plenty at farmers’ markets). During the winter, consider using dried 
plants and flowers, and other decorations from local sources. In spring and 
summer, opt for potted flowers.
#

!
 
Of course, eating locally is carbon-low only if you buy in season. Local food 
grown out of season in energy-intensive greenhouses may be worse for the 
environment than food that’s shipped from elsewhere, recent research has 
found.
Choosing organic
The big O: Organic foods. Because they’re grown without pesticides or artifi-
cial fertilizers, they’re arguably better for the stability and health of the land 
than non-organic foods.
 
Healthy soil is especially important because earth is a major carbon sink. 
(Refer to Chapter 2 for more about carbon sinks.)
Organic practices are spreading, but getting certified takes time and money 
that can present a barrier to smaller local farmers. You may face an uncertain 
choice between shipped organic food and local non-organic food. Overall, a 
local and non-organic product will usually have less of an impact on green-
house gas emissions than a non-local and organic one.

306
Part V: Solving the Problem 
You also may be able to go to a comprehensive, sustainable local food chain. 
In Canada, for example, the Local Food Plus (LFP) initiative brings together 
economic, social, and environmental considerations, and rewards local 
farmers (both conventional and organic) who use ecological practices. Local 
food networks exist in many places on a much more . . . well, local level. 
Often, communities and regions have their own local food network that can 
help you figure out where to buy local foods.
Cooking up fewer greenhouse gases
Energy-wasteful kitchen practices can undo even the most carbon-friendly 
food choices. A major food-services company has estimated that people can 
correct energy losses of up to 30 percent in home or commercial kitchens for 
very low cost.
 
To run a more energy-efficient kitchen, do the following:
 
 Keep a lid on it! Research has shown that the simple act of using a 
saucepan lid reduces energy used for simmering by a factor of five.
 
 Less is more. Use the smallest pot and least amount of water needed for 
what you’re boiling.
 
 Size your appliances to your lifestyle. If you’re on your own, you don’t 
need a huge oven to heat a single-serving meal.
 
 Use a toaster oven or a microwave. They take a fraction of the energy 
of a conventional stove or oven to get the same results. And in the 
summer, not having to turn the stove or oven on helps keep the kitchen 
from heating up.
Wine over the waves
Not all products from afar need to arrive with 
a high carbon price tag. For example, bottles 
with a Sail Wine logo may soon be coming to 
a liquor store near you. For the first time in 150 
years, French wines are being shipped under 
sail. Ireland is the first market for these wines, 
but at the time we wrote, the Compagnie de 
Transport Maritime à la Voile plans to add 
England, Belgium, Canada, and Sweden as 
destinations. Shipping on a sailboat has almost 
zero emissions, and the shippers claim that 
the wine only gets better the longer it’s at sea! 
Eventually, this fleet of sailboats plans to trans-
port other goods, as well, in addition to offering 
a few luxurious berths for merchants who want 
to travel with their wares.

307
 Chapter 18: Making a Difference at Home and Work
Eco-Shopping
In this chapter, we talk about better choices in electronics, appliances, and 
home finishing materials. But green shopping goes far beyond that — you can 
find low-carbon products in stores of every kind. Better choices are in the 
bag (a reusable cloth one, that is).
“No thanks, I don’t need a bag.”
Many countries and communities are moving to get rid of plastic bags, which 
are made from petroleum (a fossil-fuel product) and take up valuable landfill 
room. Grocery stores in Germany voluntarily started charging customers for 
plastic bags years ago. They set the price high enough (it’s currently over a 
dollar) that consumers remember to bring a cloth one or find it more eco-
nomical to buy a new cloth one if they forget theirs. Many stores in Canada, 
the U.S., the U.K., New Zealand, and Australia now sell and promote reusable 
bags. Some jurisdictions, such as Greece and Ireland, charge a tax on plastic 
bags, and others have imposed a ban or are planning to.
Canvas totes aren’t a fashion faux pas anymore. In fact, handbag designer 
Anya Hindmarch created a bag emblazoned with the logo, “I’m not a plastic 
bag,” which originally sold for five British pounds but went for hundreds of 
dollars on eBay after it was spotted in the hands of celebrities such as Keira 
Knightley.
Clothes make an environmental statement
What are the most energy-efficient clothes? The ones you already own, of 
course. Even though new processes and fabrics are reducing the energy 
needed to create clothing, every new item still comes with an energy price 
tag attached. So, avoid new purchases whenever possible. Treat your cloth-
ing with care and remember that patches and repairs add real character to 
your casual wardrobe.
Caring for your clothes
 
Because 75 percent of the energy consumption associated with clothing 
comes from laundering it, stick to cold-water washes and line-drying as much 
as possible. Never buy anything that needs dry-cleaning (but remember that 
you can wash some “dry-clean only” fabrics by hand, if you’re careful). Shake 
clothes out before hanging them to dry and then again after to reduce the 
amount of ironing they need.

308
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
If you have to get rid of an item, be sure to recycle it. Old t-shirts, sweats, and 
flannel pajamas make great cleaning rags, and you use fewer paper towels. 
(Nothing beats old cloth diapers for cleaning up spills and dusting!) At the end 
of their useful lives, they can go into your compost pile, along with anything 
made of wool or hemp. Also, not-for-profit organizations in most communities 
collect, reuse, and resell old clothing, as well as household items.
Making smart shopping choices
If you really have to add an item to your wardrobe, you can still make choices 
that have less of an impact on the environment:
 
 Shop for vintage clothes. Scouring second-hand boutiques is fun and 
creative. Many leading-edge new designers haunt vintage shops for finds 
that they deconstruct and recombine into great new fashion.
 
 Look for organic fabrics. Manufacturers can grow cotton, wool, linen, 
and hemp organically — so look for that on the label. Raising conven-
tional cotton alone uses 10 percent of all agricultural chemicals in the U.S. 
Generally, if it’s organic, it’s also been manufactured as energy-efficiently 
as possible.
 
 Go for classic, as opposed to trend-of-the-moment. No matter how it was 
made, a garment that lasts 20 years before it needs replacing is a better 
bet than one you want to toss out a year from now.
Choosing man-made fibers
Even man-made and synthetic fibers can have their place in your climate-
friendly wardrobe, as long as their production and use is environmentally 
sustainable. Man-made fibers come from wood pulp, bamboo, soy, or corn 
through processes that are almost the same as those used to make polyester 
or nylon. The fiber equivalent of biodiesel and ethanol fuel, they’re better 
than virgin synthetics because the raw materials come from renewable 
resources, and when garments made from these fibers need to be thrown 
out, you can compost them.
Synthetics can add durability when blended with natural fibers or provide 
lightweight fleece garments that allow you to more easily turn down your 
thermostat in winter. The longevity of synthetics can help conserve fossil 
fuels, lessening the need for reproduction. Also, plastic bottles are regularly 
recycled into fiber for clothing.
 
Of course, you need to return man-made fiber materials to the recycling 
stream when you can no longer use them so that they can feed into the pro-
cess all over again. Municipal recycling lags in this area, but many innovative 
companies, such as Mountain Equipment Co-op in Canada and U.S.-based 
Patagonia, are developing programs to recycle their own and even other 

309
 Chapter 18: Making a Difference at Home and Work
companies’ brands. Check the Web for criteria and to look for other recy-
clers by using search terms such as “ethically produced,” “environmentally 
friendly,” “organic,” or “recycled fabrics.”
Home furnishings
 
If your home is energy efficient, don’t you want the furnishings to match? 
Consider these ideas when shopping to keep your furnishings from clashing 
with your home, environmentally speaking:
 
 Go organic. Buy towels, sheets, and other linens made from organic fibers.
 
 Consider gently used goods. Look for stores and online outlets sell-
ing vintage table linens, quilts, and bed coverings. You have even more 
possibilities for reusing and recycling furniture. Older furniture is more 
solidly made than the modern stuff, and the energy and carbon costs 
associated with the wood and other materials were paid for long ago. 
Often, an older piece just needs reupholstering (maybe in organic linen!) 
to look fabulous and gain decades of renewed life. If you have a home 
office, look for salvaged or refurbished office furniture.
 
 Look for new pieces made with old materials. Just like in the cloth-
ing business, savvy designers are creating “new” furniture by recycling 
wood that would otherwise be trashed or burned.
Creating a Green Workplace
Most of the changes that you can make at home you can make at work, 
too. Your boss or manager may be more receptive than you think to your 
thoughts about energy-saving changes. Be sure you know your stuff (you’re 
already one step ahead by picking up this book). Explain that taking these 
kinds of measures can be great for the company’s environmental stewardship 
and can help save money.
 
Here are a few extra ideas that can help reduce the energy impact of your 
workplace:
 
 Go for energy-efficient equipment. Purchase the most energy-efficient 
models available when ordering new office equipment, such as photo-
copiers, printers, and computers.
 
 Install a motion-sensor that activates your office’s lighting. It can help 
cut down on emissions, automatically shutting down when no one is left 
in the office.

310
Part V: Solving the Problem 
 
 Use paper conservatively. Print double-sided and on 100-percent post-
consumer recycled, Forest Stewardship Certified paper. One company 
that made the switch to fully recycled paper calculated that they would 
prevent 14.2 metric tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted into the 
atmosphere every year. Imagine if every company and organization did 
the same!
 
 Get the windows in on the action. If your workplace is one of the few 
remaining with windows that open, use them wisely. In the summer, 
leave them open overnight if you can, which can help keep the work-
place cool. But when the nights are chilly, make sure someone shuts 
those windows before you go home. If your business is considering ren-
ovations, suggest an upgrade to more efficient windows, such as double-
paned ones.
Relaxed dress code, reduced greenhouse gases
Toyota Motor, Japan’s biggest company, had 
more in mind than happy employees when it told 
workers to forget about wearing jackets and ties 
to work for the entire summer. Office buildings 
were able to turn their air conditioning up a few 
degrees because people were dressed a little 
lighter. This idea has now caught on around 
the world. Don’t be surprised if the sweater 
Grandma knit you becomes office dress code 
come December.

Driving Smart
Fuel emissions from transportation account for about 16 percent of global 
greenhouse gas emissions (or 24 percent of emissions from energy use, not 
including deforestation). Transportation also accounts for almost two-thirds 
of oil use in the U.S. As painful as it sounds, you can best cut down your car 
emissions by not owning a car at all (although without significant changes in 
land-use planning and access to mass transportation, this will be more diffi-
cult for some than others!).

If you must drive, then drive smart. Efficient driving is climate-friendly driving. 
A lot of little changes can substantially cut your car’s emissions:
 
 Carpool when you can.
 
 Turn off your car when you stop for ten or more seconds. This applies 
when you’re pulled over to stop, or delayed by traffic construction that 
brings everyone to a standstill — not if you are in the middle of traffic at 
a stoplight.
 
 Do all your errands at the same time, instead of spreading them through-
out the day.
 
 Keep your car’s engine clean, up-to-date, and running efficiently by 
taking your car in for regular checkups (or doing it yourself).
 
 Fill your tires to their ideal pressure point (which you can find written 
right on the tire) to use less fuel.
  
 If you have a ski rack mounted on the roof of your car, remove the rack 
in the summer to reduce drag, which helps reduce fuel use.
For more tips on reducing your auto emissions, see Chapter 17.
Supporting Clean, Renewable Energy
You can support the development of clean, renewable energy in a number of 
ways, depending on where you live.
 
Here are the two most common ways to make a significant impact:
 
 Make the energy. You can make energy yourself by using options such 
as solar energy to produce hot water and generate electricity. Chapter 
13 covers other options that you can use to make energy.
 
 Buy the energy. You can purchase energy from a company that uses 
low-emission energy sources. Green power can be purchased in most 
provinces in Canada. Companies also cover 30 states in the U.S., with 
similar companies across the U.K., and in every state in Australia (see 
Chapter 18 for Web site resources on green energy providers).

 Chapter 19: Ten Things You Can Do Today to Slow Global Warming
Buttoning Up Your House
The key to creating an energy-efficient house (whether you want to keep the 
heat in or out) is insulation, insulation, insulation. Heating and cooling costs 
make up a whopping 80 percent of your energy bill, so seal up your door-
ways and windows, and make sure that you have the proper insulation for 
your crawl space, attic, and walls. Some of these changes might take a bit of 
time and effort, but they last for decades and save you significantly in energy 
costs, all while cutting back on greenhouse gas emissions.
 
Start with an energy audit so that you know where your dollars can give you 
the best results. Chapter 18 shows you how to perform an energy audit.
Bringing Climate Change to Work
The changes you make at home are important, no question. But most folks 
spend the majority of their waking hours at work. Your employer’s build-
ing and transportation fleet (if your company has one) presents two major 
projects that are just waiting to be tackled. If you nose around, you may 
find that your colleagues also want to turn your office green.
 
Here are a few suggestions that you can make to your boss, building manager, 
or other decision-makers at work to get started:
 
 Establish an energy policy that cuts down on the company’s or organi-
zation’s energy use and sets a target for reducing emissions. See www.
theclimategroup.com for a case study that might relate to your 
workplace.
 
 Put a recycling and composting system in place.
 
 Post signs or notices that remind people to turn off their computers, 
lights, and other office equipment when they leave.
 
 Organize monthly lunch programs and have a speaker come in to talk 
about solutions to climate change.
Many of these tasks mean taking an issue to a project manager or a boss, 
or even to the director of maintenance or facilities management. Forming a 
committee or advisory team with your colleagues can make you more effec-
tive and successful — you can find strength and support in numbers.

When a company stands for more than profits, employees show greater cor-
porate loyalty and improved morale, which results in better job performance 
and a drop in absenteeism.
Going Vegetarian or Vegan (Sort Of)
Eating fewer meat products can really help reduce your carbon footprint. 
Over the course of one year, the impact of going vegetarian is similar to 
trading in your regular car for a hybrid car. Taking that a step further, going 
vegan is like trading in your regular car for . . . well, no car at all.
 
You don’t need to go full-out vegetarian. Try starting with going one or two 
days per week without meat. The next best solution is to try to buy locally 
raised or wild meat, which usually comes from smaller, less energy-intensive 
operations. Chapter 18 covers more options for reducing your carbon foot-
print through your food choices.
Buying Energy-Efficient 
Electronics and Appliances
Be conservative with your purchasing choices. When you buy electronics 
and appliances, don’t buy what you don’t need. If you get a bunch of gadgets 
that you’re lured into purchasing, you end up consuming more electricity 
than you intend.
But you can’t cut every corner, and sometimes you just need a new appli-
ance or electronic. The good news is that almost every kind of electronic and 
appliance, from dishwashers to computer monitors, comes in energy-efficient 
models. Start the habit of looking for energy-efficiency labels, such as Energy 
Star. Chapter 18 shows you how to sniff out the most energy-efficient prod-
ucts in your country.
 
The energy habits that you have in your daily life make a difference, as well. 
Here are a few energy-saving changes that you can make to your daily routine:
 
 Use a drying rack or a clothesline, rather than the clothes dryer. If you 
do use the dryer, fill it up and don’t run it longer than necessary.
 
 Switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs or light-emitting diode (LED) 
bulbs, and turn on the lights only when you need them.

317
 Chapter 19: Ten Things You Can Do Today to Slow Global Warming
 
 Shut down your computer when you’re not using it.
 
 Buy products that are recyclable or that include recycled content.
 
 Choose energy-efficient forms of travel, such as the train or bus, for 
short-haul trips. To get to work, take your bike, the bus, or the subway. 
Avoid unnecessary trips altogether. (For more about reducing your 
transportation-related carbon dioxide emissions, check out Chapter 17.)
 
Any choice you make, whether you’re at the checkout counter or adjusting 
your thermostat at home, can help reduce your emissions.
Launching a Local Campaign
By launching a local campaign, you can help raise awareness and work with 
others to create positive change in your community. You don’t have to orga-
nize a protest or stage a sit-in; you simply have to come up with a plan that’s 
tailored to your community’s and campaign’s needs.
Here are some steps you can follow to help you get started:
 
1. Choose an issue relevant to your community that’s linked directly to 
climate change.
 
 For example, perhaps your town doesn’t have anti-idling bylaws, and 
you think it should. By taking on this issue, you can help fight climate 
change and protect kids who have asthma.
 
2. Contact local organizations that are connected to or working on your 
issue, and ask them for resources and advice.
 
 Toss a wide net — check out community service groups, youth groups, 
environmental groups, and so on.
 
3. Find a meeting space.
 
 Look for somewhere free or inexpensive, such as a public library or a 
community hall.
 
4. Select a date for your meeting.
 
 Choose a time that you think works with most people’s schedules. Also, 
you may want to offer child care. And think about accessibility for the 
physically challenged.
 
 Give people advanced notice so that they can make arrangements to 
attend the meeting.

318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
5. Reach out to the community to get as many people as possible to 
attend the meeting.
 
 Send event information to radio stations and newspapers. Have friends 
put up signs and send out invitations. Send mass e-mails. Set up a group 
on a social networking site such as Facebook. Don’t be shy about getting 
the word out.
 
6. Speak your piece at the meeting, and then ask everyone else to talk.
 
 Decide on your concrete goal, determine an action plan, and make sure 
that everyone has something to do when they leave.
Good luck, and let us know how it goes!
Writing to Your Leaders
Believe it or not, letters to your elected representatives make a difference. 
Postcards might catch someone’s attention, and petitions sometimes get 
noticed, but letters are by far the most effective. Politicians are eager to know 
what the people think.
Don’t worry about composing a long or deeply profound letter. Use the letter 
to express your concerns and ideas as simply as possible, then send it in. To 
get more bang for your letter-writing buck, copy the letter and mail it to other 
local, regional, and national politicians. You can even request to meet with a 
politician to discuss what the government is doing about climate change.
 
You can expand your outreach beyond political leaders. Writing to people 
within your industry, your business, or your children’s school, or even writing 
to your own boss, can lead to profound change.
Spreading the Word
Whether you love to talk (which we do!) or hate to, you can spread the word. 
Formal presentations can effectively get the message on climate change 
across to your family, friends, co-workers, and community.
You can either give a presentation yourself or ask someone to come in and 
give it for you. Al Gore’s campaign and non-governmental organization called 
The Climate Project can show you how to present the same slide-show pre-
sentation that Gore gives in An Inconvenient Truth. So far, they’ve trained 
1,000 presenters in the United States, 250 in Canada, and another 400 across 

319
 Chapter 19: Ten Things You Can Do Today to Slow Global Warming
the United Kingdom and Australia. The Project’s always planning more train-
ing sessions, so check their Web site (www.theclimateproject.org) for 
updates. From the site, you can request a presentation for your community 
or group.
You can also contact any local organization that’s working on climate change 
to request a presentation. Who knows — maybe, after you get some pointers 
from the local organization, you can give the presentation yourself.
Getting (Or Making) a Green Collar Job
Many jobs offer the opportunity to contribute directly to climate change solutions. 
And you’re not limited to working within an environmental non-governmental 
organization (NGO) — though we highly recommend this option! The following list 
gives you a glance at the kind of climate-friendly jobs that are out there today, for 
a range of qualifications, skills, and interests:
 
 Architecture and design: The world needs green building construction 
and design, and this field is looking for architects and designers with 
vision. You can help make everything within a building — from materi-
als to energy systems — green. (We talk about greener buildings in 
Chapter 14.)
 
 Building/contracting: You can offer your clients Forest Stewardship 
Council certified wood (see Chapter 14), materials (such as plastic, 
stone, wood, insulation) made with recycled content, and environmen-
tally sound materials (that are biodegradable or able to be recycled at 
the end of their lifecycle) to help them make informed choices and help 
reduce emissions adding to climate change.
 
 Education: As a teacher at any level, you have many opportunities to 
integrate climate change issues and solutions into your curriculum. You 
can even join one of the many organizations of educators who work 
together to have environmental issues put into standardized public 
education.
 
 Engineering: Engineers who want to work in climate-related fields are 
in high demand. The long list of fields includes environmental assess-
ments, water resource management, carbon capture and storage, and 
greenhouse gas assessments.
 
 Government: With more government programs starting up in various 
countries, new positions are created regularly. Look for posts within the 
departments that deal with climate change, the environment, energy, 
sustainable development, agriculture, and forestry. (Chapter 10 outlines 
some of the actions governments can take to help fight global warming.)

320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 Higher education: Being a student isn’t exactly a job (although you can 
find many climate-related research grants available), but it presents 
a way to take your knowledge about climate change to a higher level. 
Many universities and colleges around the world now offer programs 
that focus on energy, the environment, climate change, environmental 
management, climate law, and more.
 
 Music: When you’re a musician, you have people listening to you 
all the time (or, at least, that’s your goal). You can heighten climate 
change awareness through your lyrics or by speaking to your audience 
between songs.
 
 Non-governmental organizations (NGOs): The campaigns and projects 
available through NGOs allow you to work directly on an issue and advo-
cate for change. Whether you lead the campaign or assist in the office, 
your job contributes to the overall effort of effective projects. (Check 
out Chapter 15 for more about NGOs.)
 
 Visual art: Being a visual artist gives you a unique opportunity to 
express anything and everything about climate change. Photos, film, and 
all kinds of visual works of art can effectively communicate the urgency 
of global warming.
 
 Writing/journalism: If you write professionally, people read what you 
have to say. You have a wonderful opportunity to introduce your read-
ers to climate change issues. (Chapter 16 explores how the media covers 
global warming.)
 
You can find endless opportunities, whether you’re an entrepreneur or a 
job seeker, if you go looking for a green collar job. Making a difference is a 
terrific feeling.

Against Global Warming
In This Chapter
 Leading the way in government
 Writing the climate change story
 Demonstrating the difference activists can make

 Leading the corporate fight against global warming
T
housands of people around the world are working on climate change 
issues and making a difference. The ten we profile in this chapter are the 
cream of the crop. But, hey, remember — there’s always room for one more!
The Politicians
Around the world, politicians are struggling to decide how to address global 
warming. Despite facing budgetary challenges, resistance from industry, 
and a public concerned with countless other pressing issues, some leaders 
have managed to keep the climate crisis atop their agendas and are making 
positive changes. At the top of the heap are Angela Merkel and Arnold 
Schwarzenegger.
Angela Merkel
The first female Chancellor (or Chancelloress, as the German federal govern-
ment officially notes) of Germany and the leader of the world’s third-largest 
economy, Merkel played a key role in putting climate change at the top of the 

322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
agenda at the 2007 G8 meetings, where she acted as president. She also held 
the position of president of the European Union in 2007 and used that posi-
tion to push for the adoption of the European Union target of a 20-percent 
increase in energy efficiency by 2020. Merkel served as Germany’s minister 
of the environment in the 1990s, during which time she played a key role in 
convincing developed countries to join the Berlin Mandate of 1995, which led 
to the creation of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. Kyoto may not have happened 
without her work.
Speaking on climate change to the United Nations General Assembly in 2007, 
Merkel said, “It’s not only the dry facts and numbers that call us to negoti-
ate, but also the question of in what future we want to live. For me, this is not 
only an economic imperative, but also a moral one.”
Arnold Schwarzenegger
Known worldwide as an action hero in such movies as The Terminator, 
Commando, and Predator, Arnold Schwarzenegger took on a new role in 
2003: governor of California. He has since been at the forefront of sweeping 
political change, making the state of California a leader on climate change. 
He introduced green, climate-friendly innovations such as the Hydrogen 
Highway (putting the infrastructure in place to allow people to use hydro-
gen fuel-cell cars across the state) and the Million Solar Roofs Plan (a state-
wide solar rebate program helping to make possible 1 million solar roof 
installations). You can see his dedication to dealing with climate change in 
legislation that ensures cost-effective greenhouse gas reductions by using 
principles of business and economic policy. (Check out Chapter 10 to read 
about some of California’s success stories.)
The Wordsmiths
When it comes to fighting climate change, the pen is definitely mightier than 
the sword. The works of the two writers discussed in the following sections 
have topped bestseller lists worldwide and affected everyone who’s read them.
Tim Flannery
An internationally recognized scientist, writer, and explorer, Tim Flannery’s 
most recent book, The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and 
What It Means for Life on Earth (Atlantic Monthly Press), received international 

323
 Chapter 20: Ten Inspiring Leaders in the Fight Against Global Warming
acclaim for its in-depth look at climate change. His skill at clearly communicat-
ing the importance of the climate change problem has increased the worldwide 
feeling of urgency to address climate change. The Weather Makers was the first 
book to address the major questions on so many people’s minds: How serious 
is climate change? How much do we know? What’s going to happen? What can 
we do?
The book publicized the full story of climate change around the world by 
making the issues of climate change accessible to everyone. His dedicated 
work earned him the Australian of the Year award in 2007.
George Monbiot
U.K.-based writer George Monbiot is best known for his columns in The 
Guardian newspaper and his recent best-selling book, Heat: How to Stop the 
Planet from Burning (South End Press). George Monbiot’s clear and compel-
ling writings have brought attention to the perils of climate change. Monbiot 
has been praised for his forthright and demanding ideas for greenhouse gas 
reductions, developing what appears to be a feasible plan for a 90-percent 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2030. Monbiot demands 
the attention of anyone interested in climate change.
The Activists
People worldwide recognize global warming as a major issue thanks to the 
efforts of activists around the globe who are constantly reminding the media, 
the government, and the public about the climate crisis. The four individu-
als in the following sections, from very different backgrounds, demonstrate 
the many ways we can all fight global warming, and how just one person can 
truly make a difference.
Al Gore
Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore has been an advocate for environmental 
issues for most, if not all, of his life, and he has actually done more for the 
fight against climate change as an activist than as a politician. He, along with 
the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scientists, was 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for that activism.

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Today, Gore is probably best known for the documentary (and following 
book) An Inconvenient Truth, based on the presentation he gives world-
wide on the urgency of climate change. This film led to the creation of The 
Climate Project, a group that trains individuals around the world to give the 
acclaimed presentation seen in the documentary. Gore also organized the 
international Live Earth benefit concerts, which raised the climate change 
awareness of the more than 1 billion people who tuned in.
He has built on this momentum by spearheading the We Can Solve It cam-
paign, aimed at further educating, engaging, and mobilizing people around 
the world to take immediate action on climate change. This campaign is a 
project of The Alliance for Climate Protection, a non-profit and non-partisan 
organization. Gore continues to tell the world that climate change is an 
urgent problem, requiring an urgent and inspired response.
Wangari Maathai
Wangari Maathai is best known for founding and building the Green Belt 
Movement, a group whose main focus is to plant trees to restore the natural 
environment. Starting in Kenya, the movement has since become international.
A pragmatic and effective organizer, Maathai was often on the wrong side 
of the Moi government, serving time in jail and under threat for her work. 
Her amazing life of achievements includes being the first woman in East and 
Central Africa to complete her doctorate, receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, 
and serving on the Kenyan Cabinet. Most importantly, she has effectively 
mobilized millions of individuals to be a part of the solution. At the top of her 
current to-do list is to plant a billion trees in Africa, helping African countries 
adapt to the effects of climate change.
Sheila Watt-Cloutier
A long-time advocate for Inuit rights, Sheila Watt-Cloutier speaks out today 
on climate change. She and her community, in fact, are already feeling its 
effects. Originally an advocate against contaminants in Arctic wildlife that the 
Inuit depend on, her focus expanded to climate change advocacy when she 
became the chair of the international Inuit Circumpolar Conference. Watt-
Cloutier has made the world understand that climate change is inextricably 
linked with the survival of Inuit culture and spirit. In 2007, Watt-Cloutier was 
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and garnered the Canadian Lifetime 
Achievement Award for this work.

325
 Chapter 20: Ten Inspiring Leaders in the Fight Against Global Warming
While she was president of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, Watt-Cloutier 
brought a lawsuit — that continues to this day — against the United States 
to the Inter-American Commission (“Court”) on Human Rights, alleging that 
the U.S. government’s rejection of the Kyoto Protocol is threatening the Inuit 
with cultural genocide.
The Scientists
The scientists got the ball rolling with regard to climate change awareness, 
and their research continues to lay the groundwork for the world’s under-
standing of climate change. Without the dedicated work of researchers, the 
world wouldn’t know about the effects that our actions have on the planet.
James Hansen
People around the world, who value courage in telling the truth, despite 
extraordinary pressure and threats, applauded James Hansen, scientist 
and advocate for urgent solutions to climate change, for speaking up when 
the U.S. federal government tried to censor his work with NASA on climate 
change. This censorship is the subject of Mark Bowen’s book Censoring 
Science: Inside the Political Attack on Dr. James Hansen and the Truth of Global 
Warming (Dutton).
Although Hansen works as a physicist on major climate change modeling, 
his work outside the office has had the greatest impact on the fight against 
global warming. He has made it a personal mission to communicate climate 
change to the public in the most clear-cut way possible.
Rajendra Pachauri
Pachauri is the current chair of the IPCC, the volunteer-based group that 
shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore for work on climate change. 
The pressure has been on Pachauri since 2002 because his position as chair 
has never been more important.
Pachauri, along with many other leading IPCC scientists, attends all the UN 
Climate Change Conferences and delivers presentations explaining the latest 
science to negotiating bureaucrats. He also writes IPCC reports about the sci-
ence of climate change for politicians and the public.

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The Business Leader
As one of the crusaders in environmental business leadership, Ray Anderson 
has brought his role as founder and former CEO of Interface Flooring to a 
new level. His vision, and now his company’s commitment, is to eliminate any 
impact it has on the environment. And it’s already halfway there. As he puts 
it, he’s climbing Mount Sustainability.
Starting from a midlife, late-career revelation after reading Paul Hawken’s The 
Ecology of Commerce (Collins), Anderson set out to leave the world a better 
place — not just leave a lot of money and a big corporation. He shifted his 
company’s annual statement to “what we take, what we make, and what we 
waste” accounts.
His central discovery was that every time Interface closed off a smokestack 
or a wastepipe, the company saved money. Every energy-saving effort, 
including tapping into landfills for the energy to run Interface’s plant, 
improved the corporate bottom line.
In his personal life, Anderson drives a hybrid car and lives in an off-the-grid 
home (the house doesn’t draw energy from local power supplies but gener-
ates its own renewable energy). Professionally, he continues to share his best 
practices with businesses around the world that are looking to become more 
sustainable and lower their impact on climate change.

G
lobal warming has been a topic of discussion for years, but the discus-
sion only recently has permeated all countries and cultures. In some 
cases, the fossil-fuel industry has financed major public relations campaigns 
to promote doubt about the level of risk and degree of scientific consensus 
concerning global warming. Because of their efforts, a great deal of misunder-
standing exists. In fact, if you ask some folks, they’ll tell you that the whole 
“climate change thing” is nonsense. In this chapter, we tackle the ten most 
common myths — and offer arguments that refute them.
A Big Scientific Debate Exists
The idea that a big scientific disagreement exists regarding global warming is 
one of the most persistent and erroneous claims used to delay taking action. 
For more than a decade, the overwhelming majority of scientists have agreed 
on the key elements of the problem:

328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 The planet is and has been warming, and it will continue to warm for the 
foreseeable future.
 
 The warming isn’t happening because of natural factors alone; it’s 
largely due to human activity — burning oil, coal, and gas, and destroy-
ing forests.
 
 The impacts of the climate changes that are happening because of rising 
temperature are serious and represent a significant threat, requiring 
global action.
The media spotlights many scientists who claim that doubt exists within the 
scientific community regarding global warming. Very few scientists foster 
that appearance of debate, and those who do are by and large not active in 
the field of climate research. Cigarette companies used similar tactics, finding 
doctors to dispute that smoking caused lung cancer. Al Gore even uses an 
old cigarette ad that shows doctors recommending a particular brand of ciga-
rette in the documentary An Inconvenient Truth.
 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the most credible 
source of climate-related information; their reports reflect consensus among 
the scientific community. If anything, the IPCC underestimates the severity of 
the risk of the coming climate crisis.
The Warming Weather Is Natural
You may hear global warming skeptics say that weather goes in cycles and 
the recent warming trend is just that: a trend that will correct itself. Natural 
climate variation does exist — that much is true. Scientists have records of 
wide temperature variations over time, ranging from the temperature lows of 
the Ice Ages to many millions of years ago when the Arctic was a swampland. 
A combination of temperature, greenhouse gas emissions, plate tectonics, 
and the sun affect the climate.
But all those things considered, scientists have reached a consensus that 
natural cycles can explain only a part of the current warming. Today’s 
quickly rising temperatures are unlike any recorded changes. Warmth isn’t 
inherently a bad thing, but because the shifts in temperature and regional 
climates are happening so suddenly, plants and animals probably won’t be 
able to adapt.
Some people use what seems like a commonsense approach to explain away 
global warming. They point out that humans didn’t keep good temperature 
records thousands or even hundreds of years ago. True. But the data extends 
further back than the approximately 140 years that people have been keeping 

329
 Chapter 21: Top Ten Myths about Global Warming
temperature records. Scientists can make reliable estimates about the base-
line temperature trends by using indirect measurements from sources such 
as ice cores from glaciers and tree rings from ancient forests.
Science that bases its conclusions on concrete evidence — from ice core 
samples to melting glaciers — makes a clear case that the warming of the 
modern world is well beyond natural variation. The atmospheric concentra-
tions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide are now about 35 percent above 
the highest levels in the last 800,000 years (based on direct measurements 
from ice cores), and have likely never been this high for over 20 million years.
Carbon Dioxide Isn’t a Big Factor
Carbon and temperature are not always linked in their historical records. But 
it doesn’t make sense to take a bit of the truth, such as this fact, and use it to 
create the impression that no link has been proved between human-caused 
emissions of carbon dioxide and changes to global temperature (and hence 
the climate). Sure, over a geologically long period of time, carbon dioxide 
levels and temperature aren’t always in lockstep. Carbon dioxide is only 
one of many greenhouse gases and only one part of the climate equation. 
However, carbon dioxide is the greenhouse gas that’s playing a lead role now.
Carbon dioxide is a powerful warming gas. About 280 parts per million 
of carbon dioxide kept the planet livable for millennia. That many parts 
per million is like a drop in a swimming pool. When the concentration of 
carbon dioxide increases, the atmosphere heats up significantly. That said, 
an increase in carbon dioxide isn’t the only thing that’s ever heated up the 
atmosphere.
 
Carbon dioxide is just one of many factors that influence the world’s tem-
perature. Overall, however, the more carbon dioxide you emit into the atmo-
sphere, the warmer the Earth gets.
Global Warming Is Caused 
by Changes in the Sun
A number of factors influence the temperature on the planet, including solar 
flaring (or sun spots) and radiative forcing (the impact of the sun’s activity, 
which varies, on the climate). The IPCC scientists reviewed the literature 
about the possibility of sunspots and changes in the sun’s activity affecting 

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
the planet’s climate. They estimate that the warming effect from increases of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is more than eight times greater than 
the effect of solar irradiance changes.
Scientists Exaggerate 
to Get More Funding
Cynics charge that scientists overstate the urgency of global warming in 
order to obtain more grants. The notion that the world’s leading scientists 
and scientific academies fudge the evidence and put themselves at odds with 
the most powerful corporations on Earth for money is pretty far-fetched. If 
anything, the environmental community and scientists have been too cau-
tious in expressing concerns.
The anticipated changes documented in the early IPCC reports, starting in 
1990, were all based on what would happen if the carbon dioxide emissions 
doubled, which led some to think that the only risk was if the concentration 
of greenhouse gases doubled to 550 parts per million (ppm). Now, scientists 
increasingly understand that the risk to societies and ecosystems is unac-
ceptably high at levels far below 550 ppm. Increasingly, scientists are calling 
for stabilization of carbon dioxide emission below 425 to 450 ppm — the 
atmosphere is at 387 ppm already, and rising at approximately 2 ppm per 
year. They say that industrialized countries need to cut greenhouse gas 
emissions by 30 percent by 2020, leading to 80-percent reductions by 2050. 
Globally (including developing countries), humanity needs to cut greenhouse 
gas emissions by 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
Science and Technology Will Fix It
You may hear people talking about new technologies that can save the 
world — clean coal, a hydrogen economy, or carbon capture and storage. 
Stick around long enough, and you even hear really wild sci-fi solutions, 
such as adding iron oxide to the ocean or putting mirrors in outer space. 
Studies show that many of these technologies, especially forms of planetary 
engineering — in other words, large-scale re-engineering of the planet — 
would make things worse.
Still, high-tech solutions are available, and you’re bound to have seen new 
breakthroughs well before this book made its way to your local bookstore. 
Each potential solution, especially the proposed use of hydrogen and fuel 
cells, may play an important role in the future, but none of them justify wait-
ing and postponing the actions people can take right now.

331
 Chapter 21: Top Ten Myths about Global Warming
Solutions that sound too good to be true are probably just that — too good 
to be true. No solution allows humanity to have its cake and eat it, too. 
People need to reduce emissions fast. Really, everyone needed to reduce 
those emissions yesterday.
Developing Countries Will Only 
Make Matters Worse
It doesn’t matter what developed nations do, critics of the Kyoto Protocol 
say, because the developing nations are totally unregulated. Look at China — 
they’re already the world’s biggest polluter.
To make an accurate assessment, you must consider greenhouse gas emis-
sions per person. Sure, China is the now a slightly higher emitter than the 
U.S., but at 4 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per person, it produces 
less per person than 72 other countries. India is even lower at 1.1 tons per 
person, says the World Resources Institute. In 2004, Australia and Canada, on 
the other hand, produced 17.9 and 17.3 metric tons per person. The United 
States was even worse at 20.5 tons per person.
“Rich guys go first” is the name of the game. Industrialized countries have the 
resources available to reduce emissions and are responsible for the majority 
of emissions. Requiring developing countries to reduce emissions without 
the support of industrialized countries would saddle those countries with a 
financial burden they can’t bear and without the tools to meet the challenge. 
Industrialized countries must lead the way on emission reductions so that 
developing countries don’t follow the same development path that the indus-
trialized countries took — one based on fossil fuels.
Vanishing Arctic Ice Will 
Help the Economy
Many people see at least two benefits of the vanishing Arctic ice. First, the 
legendary Northwest Passage could be seasonally open — when the ice 
melts — any summer now. Folks in shipping like the look of this shortcut 
between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The Northwest Passage can cut 
thousands of miles off the route now followed through the Panama Canal. 
The loss of ice also invites the idea that fossil-fuel companies can tap oil and 
gas reserves lying under the Arctic Ocean. Yes, companies want to extract 
and burn the very fossil fuels whose emissions caused the ice to melt — 
causing more ice to melt.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Human-induced climate change has already caused the loss of 1.2 million 
square miles (2 million sq km) of ice — a 10 to 20 percent decline of summer 
sea ice cover, as compared to what was present 30 years ago. The remain-
ing ice is also thinner than it was 30 years ago. These trends of thinning and 
melting accelerate the rate of warming in what scientists describe as a posi-
tive feedback loop: While the ice melts, the albedo effect (ice reflecting the 
sun’s radiation away from the surface) is reduced, and the open dark waters 
absorb the sun’s heat, leading to faster ocean warming and more melting ice.
The resulting changes in ocean temperatures have global impacts. Without 
question, melting Arctic ice threatens the world as we know it. Surprisingly, 
rising sea levels aren’t the threat. Rising sea levels occur when the ice of 
Antarctica and Greenland, where ice doesn’t lie over open ocean, melts and 
runs into the ocean.
The Arctic ice melting is like the ice cube melting in your drink on a hot day. 
The melting ice takes almost the same space as the frozen ice. Because Arctic 
ice is made of fresh water, it stays above the saline waters of the ocean when 
it melts, depressing the current. The Gulf Stream has already slowed by 30 
percent in the last few decades.
While more Arctic ice melts, the Gulf Stream is at greater and greater risk. 
If the Gulf Stream stalls, the world will experience a massive and abrupt cli-
mate shift. The resulting changes would move like a row of dominos, causing 
sudden changes in precipitation patterns, drought in major food-growing 
regions, and shifts that increase severe extreme weather events. The U.K., for 
example, would find itself in a much colder climate, more like that of Canada.
People Can Adapt
That humanity can adapt isn’t really a myth. People can adapt. But human-
ity’s adaptability doesn’t mean people can ignore the demands to reduce 
greenhouse gases.
People can adapt to the impacts of climate change at the lower end of 
impacts. In other words, scientists know that the climate is changing because 
of human activity. But humanity doesn’t know where the new concentrations 
of greenhouse gases will level off. What will be the new normal?
If the world can reduce greenhouse gases quickly enough, humanity could 
hold that new normal to 400 to 425 ppm. Many scientists are arguing that we 
must keep carbon at no more than 350 ppm. But if people adopt the “Who, 
me? Worry?” philosophy, the new greenhouse gas concentrations could level 
off at 550 ppm, 650 ppm, 700 ppm, or higher.

333
 Chapter 21: Top Ten Myths about Global Warming
By 450 ppm, most scientists anticipate levels of climate crisis so severe that 
humanity won’t be able to adapt. These predictions paint a picture of a very 
grim future. Humanity would have to deal with natural disasters, rising sea 
levels, and social and political disruption; millions of environmental refugees; 
and food shortages and famines. No one can adapt to that.
So, humanity needs to reduce emissions, but people also must adapt.
Scientific Models Don’t Accurately 
Project the Future
No one can perform traditional science on the entire atmosphere. You can’t, 
for example, manipulate one variable, observe how all the others change, and 
then jump in a time machine and re-run the experiment a few times. Instead, 
scientists use computer simulations that rely on well-established scientific 
equations that describe the atmosphere and oceans.
Some critics claim that people don’t and can’t ever fully understand the com-
plexity of the climate. Of course humanity won’t fully understand. As it turns 
out, however, the present understanding is more than adequate to act.
Some folks expect scientists to invent a functional crystal ball. Of course, no 
crystal ball can tell your fortune, but it’s amazing how close scientists have 
come to projecting the future. The models they use are incredibly intricate 
and require super-computers to crunch through the data. Those computers 
give highly effective models.

lthough global warming has just recently caught the world’s attention, 
you can already find a lot of information about it online. But you might 
find sorting through it all challenging. In this chapter, we point you to the 
best sites, whether you want to explain to your kids about global warming, 
need a place to start for your own research, or want to know as much as you 
can about the issue.
Never Too Young: EcoKids
You can help the kids in your life understand the environment and climate 
change by pointing your computer’s Web browser to the EcoKids site (www.
ecokidsonline.com). “Teach a child, and you teach the world” is the site’s 
slogan. Although EcoKids is based in Canada, everyone can find it useful, 
regardless of where you live. The site boasts more than enough content to 
keep any kid happy and discovering interesting facts about climate change 
for hours. EcoKids includes the following content:
 
 Games: Each game shows kids how to make the best choices about cli-
mate change and the environment.

336

water, among other topics.
 
 Content for teachers: With resources for in-class curriculum, book 
lists, and resources for starting an EcoKids club, teachers find the site 
a dream.
Sticking with the Science
The amount of scientific research on global warming is constantly growing, 
and scientists are always updating their findings. To get in-depth information 
and the latest research on an ongoing basis, we recommend the following 
Web sites:
 
 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (www.ipcc.ch): Created 
in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United 
Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) is a team of scientific experts who, among other 
duties, writes reports for the United Nations. These experts look at all 
the peer-reviewed science in the world relating to global climate change 
and synthesize it into assessment reports. On their site, you can access 
their numerous reports, which cover the science behind climate change, 
its effects, and potential solutions to it.
 
 If you want the detailed scientific background to climate change, check 
out the IPCC’s full reports; if you’re just looking for the big picture, we 
recommend the reports for policymakers.
 
 Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (http://cait.wri.org): This site, 
offered by the World Resources Institute, enables you to create graphs 
that compare greenhouse gas emissions by country, by source of emis-
sions, by carbon dioxide per person by country — or by pretty much 
any other combination you can think of, actually. You need to sign up in 
order to use the tool, but it’s free.
 
 You may find the site a little intimidating at first glance because it’s not 
geared to the general public. Just dive in and use the tool, however, to 
become more comfortable.
Going Governmental
Your own government’s official Web site often has current information on cli-
mate change projects and initiatives underway, how this information affects 
your life, and what you can do to become involved. But don’t feel bound by 
borders — check them all out!

337
 Chapter 22: Ten Online Global Warming Resources
Australia
The Australian government has an official Greenhouse Office. (Bet they get to 
wear shorts to work all year round.) On their site (www.greenhouse.gov.
au), you can explore
 
 The connections between climate change and Australia’s natural 
resources, industry, and agriculture
 
 Global warming’s impacts on Australia and how the government plans to 
deal with the problem
 
 How to shop for or build a climate-friendly home
This Web site is the most comprehensive of the bunch listed in this and the 
following sections, and it’s a great resource for anyone. Nothing is missing! 
(Not even, since the recent change of government, a Kyoto Protocol target.)
Canada
Environment Canada’s simple climate change Web site, www.ec.gc.ca/
climate, offers a brief overview of climate change, suggests actions for you 
to take at home, and provides access to speeches about climate change made 
by government officials. By digging around the site a bit, you can also find the 
following information:
 
 Reports on Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions and commitments to the 
Kyoto Protocol
 
 How to apply for incentives and rebates that apply to activities such as 
renovating your home, upgrading your car, or doing pretty much any-
thing else that improves your personal energy efficiency
 
 Examinations of climate change and its relation to agriculture, energy, 
and transportation in Canada
The Canadian government also hosts a site dedicated to greenhouse gases at 
www.ec.gc.ca/pdb/ghg. For a more general environmental site run by the 
government, visit www.ecoaction.gc.ca.
United Kingdom
The British government’s climate change site (www.climatechallenge.
gov.uk) is our personal favorite because it’s clear, direct, and to the point. 
At this comprehensive Web site, you can

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 Bone up on the basics of global warming
 
 Calculate your own carbon dioxide emissions
 
 Look into the climate change projects, initiatives, and policies of the fed-
eral government
 
 Get involved in local projects
United States
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s site offers a bunch of useful 
information. By browsing around www.epa.gov/climatechange, you can 
find the following:
 
 The government’s climate policy
 
 The effects of climate change on health and the environment
 
 Links to your state and local governments, as well as their action plans
We’ve Got the Power: International 
Energy Agency
If you get energized thinking about the possibilities for power that exist 
beyond fossil fuel, check out the Web site for the International Energy Agency 
(IEA), www.iea.org. The IEA acts as an energy consultant for its 27 member 
countries, which include the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United 
Kingdom. Originally created during the energy crisis of the mid-1970s to deal 
with oil supply emergencies, the IEA’s focus has changed with the times, and 
it now deals with all sources of energy.
The IEA’s Web site is for the ambitious. If you want to know the ins and outs 
of the global energy world, this is the place to find it. Throughout the entire 
site, you can find information on the following:
 
 All forms of energy: The IEA offers a wealth of reports about energy 
sources such as renewable sources, natural gas, and oil. Select the 
energy of your choice from a list of links under the Topics tab, and the 
site displays information on publications, programs, workshops, and 
even contact information if you have questions.
 
 Specific energy issues: The IEA provides information about how energy 
is relevant to many different subject areas, such as sustainable develop-
ment, emissions trading, and the Clean Development Mechanism of the 
Kyoto Protocol.

339
 Chapter 22: Ten Online Global Warming Resources
 
 Country-by-country data: The IEA Web site indicates how much energy 
each country uses, where this energy goes, and the source it comes 
from. You can select a country name from a list or click a region on the 
site’s map. Each country’s page contains links to the amount of oil and 
type of renewable energy used by that country, as well as the country’s 
energy policies.
 
 How the IEA works: The site explains how the IEA works with energy 
producers, industrialized countries with high energy demands, and 
developing countries (such as India and China) to try to make energy 
supplies available and sustainable in the face of climate change.
The IEA also operates a separate site about carbon capture and storage, a 
topic that we cover in Chapter 13. You can get into the nitty gritty on that 
topic at www.co2captureandstorage.info.
Thinking Globally
Although climate change is truly a global problem (which is probably why it’s 
also called global warming), much of this book focuses on the United States, 
the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. If you’re looking for a bigger pic-
ture, we recommend a visit to the sites in the following sections.
Gateway to the UN System’s 
Work on Climate Change
The United Nations is a giant organization, with an array of sub-organiza-
tions, many of which are working on global warming issues. Point your 
browser to www.un.org/climatechange to explore the goings-on of these 
organizations.
The organizations that appear on the left menu bar are UN departments that 
have climate change projects — it’s not a short list! Click one of these links 
to open the climate change Web site of that department. These UN sites dem-
onstrate the connections between climate and other important international 
issues, such as food, human settlements, and economics.
Beyond the links to these programs and organizations, this site offers the 
following:
 
 International climate change projects: A list of incredible climate change 
projects, categorized by country and led by various UN departments

 Resources for children and youth: Games, programs, and event listings 
relevant to young people
 
 General climate change information: Fact sheets that contain informa-
tion regarding climate science, politics, and actions to take
The Pew Center on Global Climate Change
Although based in Arlington, Virginia, the Pew Center on Global Climate 
Change (www.pewclimate.org) has a truly international perspective, as its 
name makes clear. The center produces highly acclaimed research on almost 
every topic you can think of related to climate change, develops policy rec-
ommendations, and works with businesses on solutions to climate change. 
Their Web site offers a wealth of information, including a Global Warming 
Basics section, which can give you a great refresher on the essentials.
If you’re really interested in digging more deeply into global warming issues, 
explore the Pew Center’s reports. They investigate just about every aspect of 
the topic:
 
 Business involvement: Reports cover effective governance strategies, 
the effectiveness of emissions trading, and the market consequences of 
climate change.
 
 International issues: You can read about mitigation measures in China, 
transportation solutions in the developing world, the thorny issue of 
global fairness, and much more.
 
 Science and impacts: This section of the site houses reports that track 
the causes of global warming and examine the effects it’s had on the 
planet.
 
 Technology solutions: These reports cover everything from long-range 
energy solutions to fixes people can implement right now, such as using 
efficient appliances and cleaner transportation options.
International Institute on 
Sustainable Development
This site (www.iisd.org/climate) offers a look into major connections 
between climate change and development (in both developing countries and 
industrialized countries) on a global level. It’s pretty serious stuff and sort of 
heavy reading, but it’s also very interesting, useful, and reliable information. 

341

Scroll down the main page until you reach the Contents section (near the 
bottom). This section includes the following links (and more):
 
 After Kyoto: This page provides a glance into progress on Kyoto 
Protocol talks. After Kyoto refers to the next phase because Kyoto tech-
nically ends in 2012. This page provides breaking news, reports, and 
links to find out more about international work and foreign policy cli-
mate issues.
 
 Vulnerability and adaptation: This page gives an overview of the dan-
gers that climate change puts countries in and what people can do in 
response. You can find a wealth of projects in and reports on countries 
around the world that are working to adapt to climate change.
 
 Energy: Development revolves around energy. This page gives a back-
ground on exactly how energy fits into sustainable development chal-
lenges and what it means in the context of climate change.
