WebEx Web Meetings For Dummies

Introduction
W
ebEx is part of a quiet revolution. This revolution affects the way you
connect with other people, the way you share information, and the
way you interact with your employees, customers, and partners. That’s
because WebEx provides a cadre of Web meeting applications that enable
your organization to enter the brave new world of on-demand business.
By using WebEx, you tap into the power of a comprehensive suite of special-
ized multimedia applications that help you do everything from supporting
customers to launching a worldwide marketing event. With WebEx, you can
train employees and customers or tap into the power of your sales organiza-
tion in ways you never dreamed of.
This book helps you understand just what WebEx services are, what you can
do with them, and how you can empower your organization and its communi-
cations by taking your interactions online.
About This Book
For Dummies books are here to make your exploration of a new topic easier.
In this book, I point out the benefits of the WebEx Web meeting services and
tell you how to use specific features. Of course, some features may be more
relevant to your organization than others. I haven’t written this book assum-
ing you’d read it from beginning to end, so feel free to find the topics that are
of most interest to you and jump around to get yourself up to speed.
If you’re new to the whole concept of Web-meetings, read over the first few
parts first. If you know which service of WebEx is of most interest to your
organization, you can go directly to the relevant chapters. This is a flexible
introduction to WebEx, its services, technology, and features. Take what you
need today, and come back if you need more tomorrow.
Foolish Assumptions
I haven’t assumed much in writing this book, except that you have heard of
the Internet, that you or your organization holds meetings, and that you have
an interest in holding meetings and other events on the Web. 

You may have an interest in Web meetings because you want to save all those
travel bills that result when you send employees around the world for sales
calls. Or perhaps you want to keep your customers happy in a more efficient
way. Perhaps your training budget could be trimmed if you had prerecorded
online sessions that could form the basis of a self-paced tutorial library.
Whatever your online communications need, WebEx has a solution for you.
You may be an on-the-go professional who’d like to hold a pay-as-you-go Web
meeting with a client. Or you may be an organization with its own network
that wants to find an enterprise-wide solution to communications and collab-
oration. Whether you are a lone professional or a company with global pres-
ence and thousands of employees — or something in between — this book is
for you.
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve organized this book into parts for a few reasons. First, that’s what my
publisher told me to do. Second, organizing information into bite-sized
chunks helps you understand new concepts and facts more easily. Finally,
each part starts out with a cartoon, and I know you love cartoons.
Here, then, are the parts I’ve broken this book into.
Part I: Meet Me on the Web
Discover just what WebEx Meeting Center is, and what solutions it offers to
you, in this part. I provide a broad overview of the benefits of meeting online,
the technology that underlies WebEx and keeps your meetings secure, and
the various purchasing options available to you. In addition, this is the part
where I share some of the essential setup options for your WebEx services,
and some of the ways you can get support from WebEx as you get going.
Part II: Always Be Prepared 
Before you can start a meeting, you have to schedule a meeting, choose
your audio options, invite people, set meeting options, and assign privileges.
That’s what Chapter 4 is all about. If you need to access information on a
remote computer from within your meeting, now is the time to set up your
remote computer with this ability so it’s available to you when your meeting
starts. I show you how in Chapter 5. Finally, in Chapter 6 you explore the ins
and outs of preparing for a marketing event using Event Center.

Part III: Let the Meetings Begin
In this part, you finally jump into running your own multimedia Web meet-
ings. You discover how to start and run a meeting in Meeting Center. I show
you how to share things during a meeting, such as documents, applications,
Web content, and a remote desktop. You also explore the features of the
Web meeting space, such as chat, the whiteboard, polls, notes, and session
recordings.
In Chapter 8 you jump to the other side of the fence, experiencing what it’s
like to attend a WebEx meeting.
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, 
and Training with WebEx
Three other great uses of WebEx are holding sales meetings, supporting
customers, and training anybody you want to train. This is the part where I
take you through the ins and outs of using Sales Center, Support Center, and
Training Center. Each has its own unique features and benefits, and each
offers brand new ways to connect with people to sell, support, and train.
Part V: Taking WebEx Further
When you have mastered how to set up and hold various Web meetings and
events, it’s time to explore more advanced WebEx topics. In this part, you look
at all the reporting capabilities of WebEx that help you monitor your online
meeting activity and maximize your use of WebEx. I also provide a chapter
that gives you an overview of what’s involved in administering your WebEx
site, should you opt for an enterprise-level solution.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
What would a For Dummies book be without this section? Here’s where you

WebEx Web Meetings For Dummies 

Part I
Meet Me on 
the Web

In this part . . .
You’ve got to start somewhere, right? In this part, you
get an overview of what WebEx is and how you can
begin to familiarize yourself with its features through
online demos and training. You take a peek at the online
meeting environment and cozy up to various support
options available to you. Finally, you hear about the bene-
fits of meeting online, from cost savings to security and
everything in between.

 What, exactly, is WebEx?
 Understanding the Web-based nature of WebEx
 Running through the various WebEx meeting applications
 Discovering how people use WebEx applications
 Taking a first look at what WebEx has to offer
W
e’ve come a long way from the first meeting, which probably occurred
when a few cavemen sat around a fire discussing the pros and cons of
hunting saber-toothed tigers. We’ve replaced their grunts with sophisticated
language (sometimes several languages in a single meeting). We’ve found
ways to visualize our ideas with whiteboards and bullet point presentations.
Companies have utilized all sorts of technologies, from conference phones to
video conferencing, in search of the perfect meeting.
Yet for most of us, there are still a few obstacles to effective meetings.
Organizing a meeting can be a nightmare in itself, with a wide variety of
schedules and locations to accommodate. The cost of getting to and from a
meeting, both in terms of time and travel expenses, can be prohibitive. If a
meeting is held on the phone or even online, concerns about security and
reliability (“Hey, Johnson just got disconnected . . . again!”) abound.
Enter WebEx. WebEx offers a comprehensive suite of Web meeting applica-
tions designed to improve collaboration and increase your productivity.
Simply put, WebEx has found solutions to many of the problems you face in
setting up and hosting meetings. The solutions work for any meeting, from a
handful of people holding a spontaneous problem-solving conference across
the corporate campus, to a CEO delivering a report on corporate profits to
3,000 employees located around the world.

Look, Ma, No Software!
The first thing you need to understand about WebEx solutions is that there is
no box to open. Customers simply access WebEx applications with a common
Internet browser. WebEx offers a set of applications, and those applications
are Web-based. That means you access your meeting online. So if you’re on
the road, you can tap into the meeting as easily as the nearest Internet con-
nection. It also means that you don’t have to do much of anything to set up
and maintain your WebEx applications, and you don’t have to fool around
with hardware to deliver a presentation (which beats having to fool around
with connecting your laptop and that darn overhead display thing like you
did at the last Dallas sales conference, huh?). 
It’s Not Software . . . So What Is It?
WebEx has developed a comprehensive suite of Web meeting applications
because not all meetings are alike. It offers you a very flexible approach to
purchasing one or more meeting applications that make sense for your busi-
ness. WebEx’s Web meeting applications are designed to fit a specific meeting
need, such as running a medium-sized project meeting, launching a global
marketing event for thousands of people, or holding a one-on-one customer
support session. You can mix and match the applications you need, and add
new ones at any time. You can even customize your meeting applications to,
for example, sport your own company logo in every meeting.
You can take the plunge and get a whole slew of these applications by buying
WebEx Enterprise Edition. This includes Meeting Center, Sales Center, Training
Center, Event Center, and Support Center in a single, easy-to-deploy interface
for the company with a broad range of meeting needs.
Taking a look at all WebEx has to offer
Using WebEx, you can expand the reach of everybody in your company,
from Jack the CEO to Jill the sales manager, to tap the potential of real-time
collaboration.
WebEx currently offers the following Web meeting applications (what you
have available depends on what your company buys):
 WebEx Meeting Center™: This is for those garden-variety meetings that
make up so much of our work days. From project or team meetings to
impromptu brainstorming or troubleshooting meetings, this is where
you’ll conduct your business on a day-to-day basis. You can see a
Meeting Center meeting in progress in Figure 1-1.

Part I: Meet Me on the Web 

 WebEx Event Center™: This is specifically designed for larger scale
events, which can easily involve thousands of people in diverse loca-
tions. New product introductions, strategic business announcements —
anything that requires that you really make a splash — work great in
Event Center.
 WebEx Training Center (see Figure 1-2): Do you want to supercharge
your training programs with an online component? Does your training
require you to set up hands-on computer labs, register students for a
training session, hold interactive discussions, or demonstrate how a
software product works? If so, you need Training Center.
 WebEx Sales Center: Looking to get an edge over the competition?
Using Sales Center, salespeople can improve their win rates by holding
sales calls online.. Here you can demonstrate applications, share presen-
tations, bring in experts on the fly, and discreetly view the whole meet-
ing from your sales prospect’s point of view.
 WebEx Support Center: With desktop control, remotely resolving tech-
nical problems is a snap. Hold one-on-one meetings (or one-on-one plus
experts you call in to help out) with customers or employees to trouble-
shoot problems and provide personalized assistance.

Chapter 1: What’s a WebEx?

One thing you’ll get used to as you get familiar with the service is that WebEx
calls different meetings different things. You hold meetings in Meeting Center
and Sales Center, run events in Event Center, and hold sessions in Training
Center and Support Center. I may refer generically to meetings in some places
in this book, but when I get into the meat of a particular application, you’ll
discover the appropriate lingo.
Do you have to buy a bunch of services to simply meet online? No. You can
get your feet wet with the WebEx Pay-Per-Use service, which allows you to
hold meetings as you need to and be charged one at a time. See Chapter 2 for
more about Pay-Per-Use.
What do you get?
Each meeting application offers different features. But, on a broad level,
here’s what the various WebEx solutions provide:
 Tools for scheduling meetings, including Instant Meetings and One-Click
Meetings for initiating meetings on the fly. You’ll learn more about these
in Chapter 4.
Figure 1-2:
Training via
WebEx.
10
Part I: Meet Me on the Web 

 An online meeting environment (see Figure 1-3) with features for sharing
files, giving sophisticated multimedia presentations, interacting with
attendees, annotating presentations, incorporating video, recording
meetings, and even sharing Web pages and applications. Chapter 7 gives
you specifics about many of these features.
 A secure, reliable network based on a platform called WebEx MediaTone™,
which supports a full range of real-time data, audio, and video communi-
cations in several languages. You discover more about this technology
and how it does what it does in Chapter 2.
 Tools to help run a meeting (there’s even an eject feature to get rid of
that uncooperative attendee — there’s one in every bunch), poll atten-
dees to check their understanding of material or get their input (see
Figure 1-4), and generally ensure that everybody has a productive, pleas-
ant meeting experience.
 A centralized command center called My WebEx™(see Figure 1-5) where
you can configure settings, view all the meetings you have scheduled
and their status, and generate reports about your meeting activities.

What do you have to do?
Though you can add some bells and whistles, here’s essentially what you
need to make use of most WebEx meeting features:

Part I: Meet Me on the Web 

 A computer (desktop or laptop) or wireless device with an Internet 
connection.
 The WebEx client downloaded to your computer (this takes seconds to
do and is pretty much automatic; I take you through it in Chapter 4).
 A connection, which can be either through a WebEx teleconference (see
Figure 1-6) or an Internet Phone connection using something called VoIP
(which you’ll hear more about in Chapter 4).
A Plethora of Multimedia
Communications Options
Great. So WebEx provides all these tools for online interaction and communi-
cation. But just what are people out there doing with the service?
Just about anything you can imagine, actually . . .
Putting meetings in their proper places
WebEx began with a focus on online meetings, so meetings are a lot of what
people use WebEx for. But meetings can mean different things to different
people.
With the WebEx solution, you can
 Hold events with up to 5,000 attendees in Event Center. Think annual
meetings. Think new product announcements to a global customer base.
Think of informing your employees that you’ve just been taken over by a
huge conglomerate. WebEx Event Center supports this type of enterprise-
wide event.
 Call impromptu meetings on the fly with the Instant Meeting feature.
Meeting Center, and Training Center offer this instant option, and all 
centers offer a One-Click Meeting option you can run to enable you to
launch meetings quickly from your desktop or even Office software. This
quick access to meetings or sessions is great for brainstorming, solving
problems across time zones, or announcing a shift in project priorities
that requires quick action.
 Use integrated audio to keep conversations flowing. Take advantage
of integrated audio services to monitor and control audio activity from
within the WebEx meeting environment. All WebEx Web meeting applica-
tions are available with your choice of audio services. Choose toll or
toll-free global teleconferencing (see Figure 1-6) with call-in or call-back
options or VoIP.
13
Chapter 1: What’s a WebEx?

 Run meetings that involve people in geographically diverse locales.
These may be training sessions for employees in three or four countries,
for example. You can easily share files and document your ideas on a
whiteboard during a sales meeting with international customers. In fact,
anything you can do in a face-to-face meeting can be done in a WebEx
meeting or session (except passing around the coffee and donuts).
Presentations with an attitude
Meetings may get lots of people talking, but for those times when your meet-
ing is more of a presentation, you’ll be glad to hear that making presentations
is easy with WebEx Meeting Center, Training Center, Sales Center, and Event
Center.
With WebEx presentations, you can create multimedia-rich presentations
with PowerPoint animation and transition features with high-speed streaming
of multimedia. This simply means that you can fly slides in from the right or
left, twirl bullet points around in space, and add neat special effects without
painful glitches and delays on the user’s computer. Figure 1-7 shows such a
presentation in progress. (By the way, Chapter 6 provides some wonderful
tips for building great online presentations.)

Sharing things
One of the great strengths of the WebEx experience is the ability to share
things, from single documents to your whole desktop. This makes an online
meeting truly interactive.
Here are a few ways that you can share in a meeting (but remember this will
vary depending on which WebEx Center you are using):
 Allow attendees to browse the Web with you and explore Web sites
you direct them to. You might acquaint your customer service people
with the online ordering process on your own Web site, or have your
Web design and marketing people explore the competition’s Web sites
together to get ideas about how to differentiate your site, for example.
 Enable attendees to share an application without having it installed
on their computers. What a great way to demonstrate your new soft-
ware product to customers or train employees on a new data-processing
system!
 Share your customer’s desktop so you can troubleshoot a setup prob-
lem in a support session.

See Chapter 7 for information about both shared browsing and shared 
applications.
Getting Started
I could describe a football game to you all day, but unless you’ve seen one,
you don’t really know what the experience is like. In the same way, now that
you have an idea of what WebEx’s suite of applications is and what you can do
with it, it would probably help you to jump right in and play around with it.
WebEx offers an amazing array of ways to get into the WebEx experience and
lay the groundwork for using the service. These guys practically hold your
hand through the entire experience of learning about their services and set-
ting up your first meeting.
Attending a demo
One of the best ways to experience WebEx is to go through its online demo
(see Figure 1-8). Go to www.webex.com and click the Join the Live Demo link.
You’ll be greeted by a real live host who demonstrates just what a WebEx
meeting is all about. Ask questions or just sit and watch — it’s a low-stress,
user-friendly process, and you can duck out whenever you need to.
Experiencing the free trial
Are you the type who thinks nothing worthwhile is free? Well, in this case,
you’re wrong. If you want more time one-on-one with WebEx, you can try the
free, 14-day trial. You get unlimited online meetings for up to three people for
two whole weeks.
You can also use various support and training features, as well as the Meeting
Assist feature. Meeting Assist gives you the services of a WebEx support
person for 20 minutes as you run your first online meeting. You can use this
help during a live meeting, or, if you want to do a dry run instead, your
WebEx helper will spend time one-on-one to get you up to speed on the
WebEx meeting environment.
Just follow these steps to sign up for the free trial (did I mention that it’s
absolutely free?):
16

S
ecurity, savings, superior reliability — these are a large part of WebEx’s
benefits picture. But WebEx can also help you proactively build your
business and increase your revenue. So what’s the first step to getting on
board with WebEx?
Whether you need to convince a board of directors to sign up or just want
to feel comfortable as you use WebEx for your meetings, it’s useful to first
understand how the technology behind WebEx makes it secure and reliable
and scalable to your individual needs.
In this chapter, I tell you about WebEx’s exclusive underlying technology
(called MediaTone), help you understand how WebEx keeps your meetings
secure, introduce you to the key components of Meeting Center, and give you
an overview of the various WebEx services and costs.
Consider this your briefing on just what makes WebEx tick.
The Technology behind the Scenes
There’s no reason for you to go under the hood and take apart the technol-
ogy that makes WebEx work, so I won’t go there. But it is helpful to have a
basic understanding of the technical foundation of WebEx so you can appre-
ciate its unique features and reliability.

There are essentially two parts to the MediaTone technology: the network
and the platform.
The underlying architecture:
The MediaTone Network
Just as a building is built on a foundation, WebEx meeting technology is built
on a worldwide network architecture called the MediaTone Network. WebEx
has set up network switches around the globe to provide access points that
allow you to have secure online meetings, from Timbuktu to Tallahassee.
Furthermore, there’s an automatic fail-safe capability built within the network
architecture so your WebEx services are always there for you. This private
network is the most reliable available, and it’s unique to WebEx.
One important thing about the MediaTone Network is the security it offers.
Some other meeting services use a database-centered model, in which meet-
ing data is stored and retrieved, but MediaTone relies on carrier-switching
20
Part I: Meet Me on the Web 
If you really care . . .
If you’re the techie type, you’ll want all the
techie specifics. Here they are:
The MediaTone Network leverages the T.120
standard, which supports platform-independent,
multipoint data communications. T.120 was orig-
inally developed by leading telecommunications
providers to promote Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) service. T.120 is the first well-
defined switched architecture for real-time data
communications. This standard addresses multi-
media technology issues with attention to both
voice and data requirements.
WebEx has built upon the T.120 standard by
adapting it to a Web-native infrastructure
and enhancing the T.120 Presentation and
Application Layers. WebEx has also extended
the T.120 protocols for scalability, fault tolerance,
security, and manageability, while assuring
PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network)
integration. By basing the MediaTone Platform
on an enhanced version of the T.120 standard
and by creating a set of integration toolkits,
WebEx has created a highly scalable and open
information-switched network.
The T.120 protocol that MediaTone uses for
switched real-time data communications
focuses on a portion of the OSI (Open Systems
Interconnection) communication model (Layers
5–7, if you must know). Why should you care?
Because the OSI model is a standard that
defines how messages should be transmitted
between any two points in a telecommunication
network. (Now that you know what it is, you can
forget the OSI acronym entirely. . . .)
Okay? Moving on . . .

technology — the same thing your phone company uses to switch phone
communications instantly around the world. Although you can connect to
WebEx from anywhere, at any time, your meeting contents are never stored in
somebody else’s database. Instead, they are immediately switched through
the MediaTone Network.
You’ll hear more about security in the section titled “But Is It Secure?,” later
in this chapter.
Communicating in real time with
the MediaTone Network
MediaTone provides the suite of meeting applications that WebEx offers with
many features and a rich set of multimedia communications goodies that
make online meetings and events happen. The technology offers fast perfor-
mance, while being reliable, scaleable (meaning you can invite a few people
to attend or invite a few thousand) and secure.
The MediaTone Network gives you the following perks:
 Whiteboarding
 Application sharing
 File transfer
 Support for HTTP
 Vector-based graphic format for sharing documents and formatting
 Sharing and synchronizing rich media
 A set of APIs (application program interfaces) and other programmer-
type tools that allow Meeting Center to be integrated with Web and desk-
top applications
I explain how all of these capabilities, made possible by the MediaTone
Network, translate into Meeting Center features in the section titled
“Exploring a WebEx Site,” later in this chapter.
Mac or PC? No problem!
Do you love your Apple? Or does the Windows opening music make your feet
tap and put a smile on your face? Wherever your loyalties lie, you’ll be happy
to know that the MediaTone Network plays well with other platforms. No
matter what kind of computer you use, from Windows or Linux-based PCs to
21
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Meeting Online

Macs, WebEx provides a cross-platform solution. MediaTone even allows you
to use many wireless devices, such as PDAs, to access your online meetings.
Sharing presentations with UCF
Universal Communications Format (UCF) is the part of the MediaTone technol-
ogy that makes interactivity possible, so it’s worth a special mention.
UCF includes a portable document format (Adobe Acrobat’s .pdf format is
an example of this that you may have used before) that allows you to share
and annotate any kind of document, whether it’s created in a software that
meeting attendees have available on their computers or not. UCF is what
makes it possible to share PowerPoint presentations (see Figure 2-1) that
include animations and transitions, Flash animations, video, audio, and even
Web pages with others in your meeting.
Figure 2-1:

22
Part I: Meet Me on the Web 

But Is It Secure?
In a word, yes. The MediaTone Network keeps private data private by
encrypting all the contents of your meetings with 128-bit Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) technology. This protocol, created by Netscape, uses a private
key to encrypt data before you send it over a secure SSL connection in the
course of running a meeting.
And most importantly, none of your data is ever stored automatically on a
WebEx server, so you can rest assured that what’s yours is yours. Although
the attendees can save shared documents from a presentation if the host has
granted them that privilege, those documents are saved to the attendees’
local computers. Another important part of the WebEx architecture is that it’s
entirely owned by WebEx. Your data never goes through some third-party
facility run by a guy named Archie in Lower Slovenia. All communications go
through WebEx hubs located around the world.
Exploring a WebEx Site
WebEx offers a whole suite of Web meeting applications, including Meeting
Center, Training Center, Sales Center, Support Center, and Event Center. Each
has its own unique features and tools. You access them all from your WebEx
enabled site.
Welcome!
The services you purchase from WebEx dictate what you see when you go to
your WebEx site. For example, if you purchase Meeting Center and Training
Center, you have tools for accessing those applications on your site. However,
a WebEx site always contains a Welcome Page and a My WebEx page plus
whatever meeting applications you’ve purchased. The Welcome Page shown
in Figure 2-2 is for a company that has purchased the Enterprise Edition of
WebEx, which pretty much provides the full suite of bells and whistles.
23
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Meeting Online

On the Welcome page, you find the following:
 A search feature to search for meetings by host name, topic, or any text
included in the meeting agenda.
 A text box in which you can enter a meeting number and click the Join
Now button to join instantly.
 Items for each center you have access to. Click the name of the center
and that page is displayed. Or, click the various links to join, register for,
or schedule a meeting, session, or event you will host.
 A Navigation bar you can use to move to individual centers, to the
Welcome page, or to your My WebEx pages.
Pick your center
The various centers offer different things on their pages. Because it’s the
backbone WebEx meeting application, I’ll start with Meeting Center. Think of
Meeting Center as a virtual version of that conference room down the hall,
but without the long walk, the funny spider-shaped conference call device, or
the hot popcorn.
On the Meeting Center page shown in Figure 2-3, you can see a set of tabs
that you can click to display scheduled meetings for the current day weekor
month. This listing includes the Starting Time, Topic, Host, Duration, and
Figure 2-2:

Part I: Meet Me on the Web 

Status of each meeting. Use the links in the Status column to join the meeting.
To see more detail about any meeting, just click its topic.
You also find a set of menus along the left side of the screen, including
 Attend a Meeting: This includes commands to find and register for a
meeting.
 Host a Meeting: Here you can schedule a meeting, see a list of all the
meetings you’ve scheduled, and access the Instant Meeting feature to
set up a meeting on the fly with only a few steps.
 Set Up: These tools allow you to install Meeting Manager (a simple soft-
ware client you download to your computer so you can utilize WebEx
meeting features). There are also Set Up features for Preferences such as
your time zone and home page, as well as My Profile, which contains
your name and contact information.
 Assistance: This gives you access to help, training, and support.
Event Center, Sales Center, and Training Center have a similar look and feel as
Meeting Center; however, there are features unique to each (which you learn
about in detail in Chapters 6, 9, and 11). Support Center, which you can see in
Figure 2-4, looks a bit different because there aren’t a bunch of prescheduled
sessions to list. Instead, you see two buttons you can click: one to join a sup-
port session and one to start a session. You can also use the links on the left
side of the screen to start or join a session, to control setup and preferences,
or to get assistance, as with the other centers.

You discover more about using Support Center features in Chapter 10.
Getting productive with My WebEx
My WebEx Meetings page (shown in Figure 2-5) is actually your WebEx
Meetings page because it contains your user profile, your address book, a list
of your meetings, your contacts, and more. It’s your personal user account
control room, from which you can manage all your account settings.
The My WebEx Meetings page contains a list of all the meetings you have
scheduled and all meetings you’ve been invited to. It also has a tab you can
use to set up One-Click Meetings; this feature places a shortcut on your desk-
top or in certain applications so you can instantly start a meeting even when
you’re not on your WebEx site. There’s also a menu bar along the left side of
the page.
Collaborating with Meeting Manager
WebEx itself isn’t a software product; it’s an online meeting environment.
However, you do have to download some software to use WebEx. These are
simple clients that take a minute or two for you and your attendees to down-
load. (Clients are software programs that run on your desktop computer but
that have to interact with a server to perform a particular function.) Don’t
worry: It’s all pretty much automated and painless.
Figure 2-4:
The Support
Center
page.
26
Part I: Meet Me on the Web 

A few clients are available: Meeting Manager, Training Manager, Sales Manager,
and Event Manager. The one you need to download will vary based on the type
of session you want to run or attend.
Each client has a similar look and feel but provides features specific to the
center it’s used with. But to give you an idea of the type of features that the
software provides, here are the capabilities that Meeting Manager provides:
 A participant list to help you keep track of who is attending
 Document and presentation sharing
 Multimedia presentation and rich media sharing
 Automatic presentation and document sharing
 Application sharing
 Desktop sharing
 Web browser sharing
 Remote computer sharing
 Web content sharing
 Video
 Audio

Integrating WebEx with other applications
There’s a reason that superstores that stock it all are so popular: Life is easier if
you don’t have to run in and out of different buildings to do what you need to
do. In the world of business, the equivalent inconvenience would be having to
go in and out of numerous software programs to get your work done. WebEx
thinks that’s a bad idea, so it was designed to integrate seamlessly into your
existing business processes and software programs you may already have run-
ning on your machine. WebEx has provided integration to some of the most
commonly used scheduling programs, including
 Microsoft Outlook: You’re in and out of your e-mail and scheduling pro-
gram all day long, right? By installing an add-in program for Outlook, you
can schedule, start, and join a WebEx meeting from within Outlook. To
install this program from the My WebEx Meetings page, click the Support
menu item, display the Downloads page, and click the My WebEx
Integration to Outlook link. 
 iCalendar-based calendar programs: With any calendar program based
on the iCalendar standard, such as Lotus Notes, you can add a meeting
that you’ve scheduled through Meeting Center to your calendar.
In addition to setting up calendar programs such as Outlook, you can use the
One-Click Meeting feature to place a shortcut button that starts an Instant
Meeting in the applications you hang out in everyday:
 Microsoft Office: The One-Click Meeting feature supports integration
with Office. This means that from within any Office application, you can
instantly start a meeting and share the application you’re in at the time
with others.
 Desktop: Hop from your desktop (whether it’s Windows- or Mac-based)
into a One-Click Meeting (see Figure 2-6). Then share any application on
your desktop just by right-clicking it and choosing a sharing option.
 Web Browser: You can place the One-Click Meeting button in your Web
browser to instantly start a meeting while browsing the Web.

 Right-click menu: When you right-click an application or file icon on
your desktop, if you run One-Click setup and choose this setting, you
see a One-Click Meeting command you can use to get a meeting going
Use the Set Up One Click tab on the My WebEx Meetings page (see Figure 2-7)
to customize all the settings for One-Click Meetings, including where you
want to place shortcuts for One-Click Meetings. The setup process includes
these five steps:
1. Enter a topic, provide a password, and choose the meeting application
service (such as Meeting Center or Training Center) that you want to
start with the One-Click shortcut.
2. Set Voice Conference options, such as whether to use Internet Phone, the
WebEx teleconferencing system, or another teleconferencing service. (You
hear more about these options in Chapter 4.)
3. Choose Meeting Options, including whether to use chat, video, file trans-
fer, or other features for your online meeting, event, or session.
4. Adjust Attendee Privileges, such as whether attendees can save, print,
or annotate shared documents.
5. Choose where you want the One-Click button to appear (see a previous
bullet list in this section for possible locations).

Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Meeting Online

The Economy of Meeting Online
You have a few ways to go when signing up for WebEx services, from buying a
single session to getting a customized subscription. Choose the right one and
you’ll save money for your organization in a variety of ways.
Pay-Per-Use
Are you the kind who dreads commitment? No problem. Just pay for meet-
ings as they come up with a Pay-Per-Use arrangement. You can schedule a
single meeting at a cost of 33 cents per minute per person attending. So, for 3
people to attend a 20-minute online meeting, you’ll pay about $19.80. Not bad
if that meeting closes a huge sale, huh? And if you need only teleconferencing
services (voice only), you’ll pay only 20 cents a minute per user.
As with any service or product, prices do change occasionally. Go to www.
webex.com and click the How to Buy WebEx link (see Figure 2-8), or call
1-866-863-3910 to speak with a customer care person and check out the cur-
rent pricing.

Buy a package
Don’t you just love packages? They usually hold happy surprises. WebEx
thought so, too, so it created two prepackaged subscriptions for Meeting
Center Online:
 WebEx Express is the economy package. You get 5 meeting “seats” with
unlimited usage and 200 total minutes of audio conferencing for $375 a
month.
 WebEx Meeting Center Pro is the next stepup. For $995 a month, you
get unlimited use for 5 seats and a total of 500 minutes of audio confer-
encing along with support for rich media communications.
Table 2-1 compares the features you get with each package in more detail.

packages and support packages. See Chapter 3 for more about buying pack-
ages and what they contain.
Note that some of these features are optional; check with your site adminis-
trator to be sure which are available to you.
32
Part I: Meet Me on the Web 

Customize!
If your meeting needs are huge (or just unique), you need a huge solution. A
customized subscription is the way to go. With the custom approach, you work
with a WebEx representative to determine which packages and services are
best for you. By using the Enterprise Edition of WebEx, you can fashion an inte-
grated, organization-wide Web communications and online meeting service.
The kinds of special bells and whistles you can get with a customized solu-
tion include a localized Meeting Center available in any of seven languages,
unlimited Training Center access with self-paced training, a personalized
interface, and a dedicated 1-800 support line.
You can call a Solution Specialist at 877-509-3239 and have a heart-to-heart
about your needs to set up a custom subscription.
Bottom line: WebEx saves you money
and increases your productivity
Now that you know what WebEx costs, it’s worth reflecting on how it saves
you time and money. With an online meeting service in place, you
 Don’t have to travel to meetings. Sure, some meetings just have to be
face-to-face, but for those that don’t, do you really want to spend hours
in a car or airport to attend them?
 Have the potential to close more sales faster, and get online with One-Click
Meetings to instantly respond to a question or solve a customer problem.
 Experience less costly document sharing and distribution, along the way
sparing the copier some wear and tear.
 Access lower-cost training and support options, again saving time and
money by not sending people to a remote site or having to support the
cost of a computer lab — just share applications online or even set up a
virtual hands-on lab through Training Center!
 Get the convenience of letting people access recorded sessions or run
through self-paced training any time they like.
 Have the ability to use a single meeting service enterprise-wide instead
of bouncing around through a hodge-podge of separate conferencing
and meeting systems.
 Avoid burdening your IT folks with another layer of software inside your
walls because WebEx is a completely hosted service.

Chapter 3
Getting Started with Meetings
In This Chapter
 Logging in to your WebEx site
 Setting up your preferences and profile
 Downloading Meeting Manager software
 Getting support from WebEx
O
kay, you’ve been through the demonstration on webex.com and the
WebEx 14-day trial, you’ve learned a bit about the ins and outs of meet-
ing online, and you’re psyched. You’re ready to sign on the dotted line and
start meeting 21st-century style. That’s what this chapter is all about.
Here’s where you discover how to get started: I’ll show you how to log in to
your WebEx account and set all your personal preferences. I’ll tell you about
downloading the Meeting Manager software (yes, it’s a Web-based service,
but there is a little software involved) and explore the many different options
for support so you’re not all alone out there.
It’s time to enter the brave new world of online meetings. Trust me, this won’t
hurt a bit . . .
Logging In: Beam Me Up, Scotty!
After signing up with WebEx, you will be provided with a Meeting Center Web
site address (usually in the format your_company.webex.com). This is where
you go to schedule and start meetings and to manage various user settings.
Follow these steps to log in to Meeting Center:
1. Enter your Meeting Center URL into the address box of your browser
and press Enter.
2. When your WebEx site appears (see Figure 3-1) click the Log In button
on the Navigation bar.
3. Enter your username and password and click Log In.

Want instant login? Click the Remember User Name and Password check box
on the page and you’ll never have to log in again. However, remember that
any joker who can get his hands on your computer can also log in and run
meetings. (I grant you, roving meeting thieves are not rampant, but there is
a security issue you should consider when setting up an automatic login.)
To log out (I bet you can guess this one), just click the Log Out button.
Setting Up WebEx to Suit You
WebEx offers several ways to customize your WebEx experience. On the
WebEx Meeting Center Welcome page (an Enterprise Edition Meeting Center
is shown in Figure 3-1), notice that there are four items that you can use to
instantly join or host an Event, Sales meeting, Support session, or Training
session: The applications that you see in your WebEx site will vary depending
on which applications you’ve purchased. There’s also a My WebEx button:
Click it to go to My WebEx to begin setting up your personal control center. 
Click the My WebEx button, and you’ll see the options offered in Figure 3-2.
Log In button

Part I: Meet Me on the Web 

Editing preferences
Preferences aren’t rocket science; in fact, if your company hasn’t purchased
localized versions of WebEx for use in different countries, the only setting
here will be your home page when you enter Meeting Center. But if you have
a localized solution in place, there are some settings here that are important
to take a look at before you start meeting. For example, simply changing your
locale setting will affect all your listed meeting times, dates, currency used,
and numbers.
When you click the Preferences button in My WebEx, you see the four simple
settings shown in Figure 3-3 (remember, if you haven’t purchased localized
versions, you will only see the home page item).
The four settings you can adjust here are as follows:
 Home Page: You can set one home page for your WebEx site; this is the
page you will go to when you open the site. You can choose from five
items by choosing from the Home Page drop-down list; then make a selec-
tion from the drop-down list to the right of your choice to specify exactly
what will be displayed on that page. For example, you can choose to make
Sales Center your home page with the Browse Meetings Monthly view dis-
played, rather than the default Browse Meetings Today view.

The items
along the

37
Chapter 3: Getting Started with Meetings

 Time Zone: This one’s pretty self-explanatory: from this drop-down list
choose the time zone from which you’re hosting the meeting
 Language: WebEx has several localized versions. If they are available to
your account, you can choose the appropriate one from this drop-down
list.
 Locale: Choose your country. This choice will have an impact on how
information about your scheduled meetings is displayed.
When you’ve finished adjusting your settings, click OK to save them and
return to the My WebEx page.
Modifying My Profile
You and WebEx are meant to be good buddies, but you can’t cozy up to a
new friend without knowing something about him or her, right? The My Profile
settings in My WebEx allow you to tell WebEx all about yourself (no, WebEx
doesn’t need to know your favorite color or most embarrassing moment).
What you enter in My Profile is basic contact information such as name,
address, and phone numbers; and the default type of session you’d like to set.
If you own the My WebEx Pro solution you can also set any welcome message
or image you want to display on your Personal Meeting Room page here.
Figure 3-3:
Set up your
preferences
quickly from
this page. 
38
Part I: Meet Me on the Web 

To modify My Profile, follow these steps:
1. Choose My Profile from the My WebEx Navigation bar along the left
side of the page. The form shown in Figure 3-4 appears.
2. Enter your personal information, including name, address, phone,
e-mail address, and so on.
3. In the second section of the form, enter any welcome greeting you’d
like to appear when people enter your Personal Meeting Room.
Remember this is only available if you have purchased the WebEx Pro
version.
4. If you’d like to post an image on your Personal Meeting Room page,
you can do that here.
To do this, enter the location of the image in the Upload Image text box,
or click the Browse button to locate the image and click OK to select it.
Click the Upload button to complete the upload. There may be a slight
delay while the image is uploaded.
5. In the Session Options section, select the radio button for the type of
session you’d like to be your default.

Chapter 3: Getting Started with Meetings

6. If you’d like to give others who have a user account on your WebEx
site permission to set up meetings for you, click the Select from Host
List button and select the name of the person you want to include. (If
you haven’t yet set the person up on your Host List, enter his or her
e-mail address in the Scheduling Permission box.)
7. Click Update to save your settings.
If you have purchased Support Center and you want to rearrange the order
of tabs in the support dashboard, click an item in the Order of Tabs area and
click an up or down arrow key to move it up or down in the order. Discover
more about Support Center in Chapter 10.
Downloading Meeting Manager
Remember those prerequisites you had to deal with when you signed up for
classes in college, like when you couldn’t take the Advanced Chemistry Lab
until you took First Aid 101? Well, a WebEx meeting has an important prereq-
uisite as well: You must download the manager software client before you can
host a meeting, and all attendees must download the client before attending
as well. Don’t worry: They’ll be asked to do so and given an easy link to do it
in the e-mail that invites them to your meeting. 
To download this client yourself, follow these steps:
1. Click the appropriate button in your WebEx site for the kind of ses-
sion you want to run.
2. Click the right-pointing arrow next to the Set Up menu in the left-hand
pane. Setup items are displayed.
3. Click the software link (Event Manager, Training Manager, or Meeting
Manager, depending on the page you’ve displayed).
4. Click the Set Up button. A dialog box appears (shown in Figure 3-5)
telling you to wait while the file is set up.
5. Wait a minute or so: That’s really all you have to do.
Figure 3-5:
Download-
ing WebEx
software.

Part I: Meet Me on the Web 

Note that Meeting Center installs Meeting Manager automatically the first time
you start or join a meeting, but it can take a couple of minutes; you and your
attendees would be wise to follow the steps above to preinstall it so you’re not
late to the meeting. You may also notice Meeting Manager downloads occur-
ring from time to time even after you’ve installed it. These are just small auto-
matic updates being made to your software.
You Are Not Alone: Getting Assistance
WebEx isn’t hard to learn or use, but it does exist in the unpredictable world
of technology, and that means unexpected problems can come up when using
your WebEx applications. People have different network configurations, dif-
ferent operating systems, different peripheral models. You could need help
from time to time.
All of the pages for Centers (Meeting, Event, Sales, Support, and Training) in
the Meeting Center include an Assistance menu on the left side of the screen.
When you click the right-pointing triangle next to Assistance, three links
appear: Help, Support, and Training (Sales Center lists Support, Training, and
Sales Assists).
Here, then, is the lowdown on WebEx Assistance, starting with Support.
How supportive they are!
The Support link takes you to a Support page (see Figure 3-6). Here you’ll find
a few different items:
 Information about the version of the center (each application is updated
separately).
 Contact information for self-service support, live support, and training,
as well as a feedback form to help WebEx continually improve services
based on your experience.
 Documentation for using WebEx and the specific center you’re in at the
time.
 Downloads for essentials, such as Meeting Manager, or add-ons you
might like to try, such as the Access Anywhere Agent for accessing a
remote computer.

Chapter 3: Getting Started with Meetings

Going for technical support
If you want a WebEx expert (in database or human form) at your beck and
call, try the two technical support options:
 You can e-mail self-service technical support, an automated support
system, by clicking the support@webex.com link.
 Find live technical support by clicking the http://support.webex.com
link, or by calling the support phone number, 1-866-229-3239. You can
also click the International Toll Free Phone Number link to look up toll-
free support numbers in any country.
Grabbing documentation
The Documentation section of the Support page is made up of brief descrip-
tions and links to documentation. Find the document that looks helpful and
click its link. The document opens in Adobe Reader (see Figure 3-7). 
If you don’t have Adobe Reader, you can download it by going to www.
adobe.com.

If you click the Help link under Assistance in any of the Centers, the Help
page shown in Figure 3-8 appears. Here you can do three things: 
 Click on an item on the Contents tab to see a listing of major topics; click
on any of these to display help information on the right side of the page,
often containing links you can click to display additional details.
 Click the Index tab to display an alphabetical list of topics and sub-
topics. Click any of these to display help information.
 Click the Search tab and enter a search term and click the Go button to
find what you need. A list of topic links appears. Click on to display help
on that topic.
You can also access help at anytime while running an online meeting or 
session.

The third item under Assistance in the Meeting Center is Training. When you
click this link, you see the following:
 Attend Training: Here’s a link to allow you to quickly register for online
training sessions. Clicking that link takes you to the Web University
Login page. (Read more about Web University in the next section.)
 Take Advantage of All Our Training Services: This section includes
links to the Training and Education section of the WebEx Support Site,
Web Service Assist and Consulting for personalized hand-holding type
help, and Specialized Training Programs.
 Contact Us: There is both a link to e-mail WebEx Training and a list of
support phone numbers.
Links provided here will get you started, but WebEx has lots to offer in the
training area, so in the next section I go into the various offerings in more
detail.
Gaining Training
There are several ways to get training on WebEx, some of which don’t even
require that you have a WebEx account.

from the menu that appears (see Figure 3-9). In the page that is displayed,
click the Quick Tour link to view information about that specific WebEx ser-
vice. You can click the screen images to enlarge them in order to help you get
a feel for the environment and features of each WebEx application.
Get your seminars free!
WebEx also offers ongoing free online seminars, which go beyond basic
WebEx training (though you pick up something about meeting features by
osmosis as you participate in the online event). They cover topics such as
Increasing Customer Satisfaction, Selling Online, and Marketing Online.
Follow these steps to sign up for a seminar:
1. Go to https://webexevents.webex.com/webexevents for a listing of
upcoming seminars (see Figure 3-10).
2. Click the Enroll link for a seminar you’d like to attend.
3. Enter information in the enrollment form that appears.
4. Click the Submit button. An e-mail confirmation will arrive shortly
with instructions for attending the event.

Nervous about running that first online meeting? WebEx gives you 20 free
minutes of coaching to help you run your first meeting after you sign up for
a WebEx account or 14-day free trial. You have to give 48 hours’ notice, and
WebEx recommends that you limit attendance to 25 people. Go to http://
try.webex.com/mk/get/WEB_MEETINGASSIST to sign up. (This is in the
Customer Care➪Assist Services area of the WebEx site.)
Going back to school: WebEx University
If you want the full treatment, try exploring WebEx University at http://
university.webex.com/training/student/index.jsp. Here you can
take advantage of self-paced training and instructor-led training. You have to
be a registered user of WebEx to attend. Check with your site administrator
to see if your company has access to WebEx University based on the package
you’ve purchased.
To sign up for a course
 Click the Self-Paced Training tab, choose a course, and click the Begin
Training button; or
 Click the Live Instructor Training tab. Click the button in the Select Day/
Time column for the course you want to take and you’ll be asked to log
in with your WebEx username and password. Then proceed to choose a
day and time and fill out the registration form for the course.

There’s also a How Do I? function you can use to learn about any single fea-
ture. From the WebEx University page, under the Self-Paced Training click the
link labeled “How Do I...?” A How Do I...? page appears organized with tabs for
the various centers such as Training Center and Meeting Center. Click on a
tab to display a center, click on a topic, and a self-paced training module
launches.
Generally speaking, WebEx University offers courses on how to actually use
WebEx services and tools; whereas public seminars provide ideas and infor-
mation about more general topics, such as how to get the most out of online
training or what makes a good online presentation. Check out the online cata-
log for the university (see Figure 3-11) for current courses. You’ll find a link
for the catalog on the Training page of Webex.com.
If you will be the one training others in your organization on how to run meet-
ings, consider taking the Train the Trainer session. If you’re the IT person
supporting users, try the Technical Support/IT Program.

S
omebody said look before you leap, right? So, heeding
those words from the wise, you can’t just leap into
your first online meeting. First, you have to discover the
ins and outs of scheduling an online meeting. Here’s
where you tap into advice for customizing your meeting
settings, inviting attendees, and assigning attendee privi-
leges. This is also the part where you explore the possibil-
ities of working with remote computers to support, share,
or inform your employees or customers. Finally, here you
learn the best way to prepare for marketing events.

M
eetings happen when people come together with some common pur-
pose. (I know, sometimes you have to work a while to find that common
purpose, but it’s there!) Meetings are where we communicate, commiserate,
come up with solutions, and collectively brainstorm. WebEx is first and fore-
most about meetings.
But you can’t host a meeting until you schedule a meeting. With WebEx meet-
ings, that could be as simple as filling in a meeting name and password; or it
could involve designing a custom registration form, setting up attendee privi-
leges and meeting options, and sending out a slew of reminder e-mails. The
process of scheduling a WebEx meeting is flexible according to your meeting
needs. There are even shortcuts to get meetings going: Instant meetings and
one-click meetings.
In this chapter, I explain all about setting up a meeting by using the various
options that WebEx makes available to you in Meeting Center.
Scheduling a Meeting
Before you can hold that staff meeting in Conference Room D, you might have
to make sure you have enough chairs, set up the flip chart, order donuts —
well, you get the idea. For an online meeting, you do have to set some things
up, but the process is (thankfully) way less painful than organizing an offline
conference.

When you set up a WebEx meeting, you simply have to fill out a series of
forms. They are easy to complete, probably taking you only about five min-
utes. I walk you through filling them out so you know what to expect.
Let the scheduling begin!
You start scheduling a meeting by clicking the Host a Meeting menu on the
Meeting Center page and then clicking the Schedule a Meeting link. The first
page that appears offers the following nine sections on which you can enter
information to schedule a meeting: Required Information, Date & Time,
Teleconference, Invite Attendees, Registration, Agenda & Welcome, Meeting
Options, Attendee Privileges, and Review.
Here’s a shortcut: You can also start scheduling a meeting by clicking the
Host a Meeting link on the WebEx Welcome page, which appears by default
every time you go to your WebEx site.
At a minimum, you have to enter the Required Information (see Figure 4-1).
After you enter that information, you can either go on to the other sections
and fill them in or click the Start button at any time to begin the meeting.
Figure 4-1:
The
Required
Information
for starting
a meeting
52
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

On the Required Information page, enter the following information:
 Enter a topic in the Meeting Topic field. (This is a required field.)
 Select the Listed on Calendar check box if you want to list the meeting
on your calendar of meetings at your WebEx site.
 If you want to erase the meeting from your My Meetings page when the
meeting is done, select the Delete from My Meetings When Completed
check box.
 Enter and confirm a meeting password that attendees must use to enter
the meeting (these might be required fields, depending on how your site
administrator has set you up) and click Next.
You might see additional fields, such as Tracking Codes, Schedule For, and
Meeting Type, again depending on what settings your WebEx site administra-
tor has made. See Chapter 13 for more about these settings.
What date, what time?
Your next stop is the Date & Time page, as shown in Figure 4-2. Here’s where
you indicate the temporal parameters for your virtual meeting (beam me up,
Scotty!).
Figure 4-2:
Set the date
for your
meeting
here.
53
Chapter 4: Setting Up Your Very First Meeting

Use the various fields in this section to specify the following:
 Meeting Date: You can choose this from the month, date, and year drop-
down lists, or click the Calendar icon and choose a date in a calendar
format.
 Meeting Time: If you want to change the time zone for the scheduled
meeting, click the time zone link (which shows your site’s default time
zone) to open a list of available time zones. Note that you can use the
settings in this area to allow attendees to join the meeting a set number
of minutes before the actual meeting time. You can then start a Universal
Communications Format (UCF) presentation before the meeting is offi-
cially started if you wish, which will play when early birds show up.
 Estimated Duration: You set this in two fields: hours and minutes.
 E-mail Reminder: This sends out automatic reminders at a certain inter-
val of time before the meeting. The default is 15 minutes. I recommend
you determine how much time your attendees need to join the meeting
and modify the default if necessary.
 Recurrence: This is the recurring interval for the meeting (if any). If you
choose to schedule a meeting to occur weekly, for example, additional
settings appear, such as the day of the week for the meeting, and the end
date.
When you finish adjusting these settings, click Next.
After you fill in the required information, you can click any of the section but-
tons to jump to another section of the form in any sequence that you like
instead of clicking Next to proceed through the sections in order.
Shall I call you?
Although you might take a plane, car, or taxi to get to a land-bound meeting,
you use your Internet connection and some form of voice connection through
a phone line or the Internet to attend an online meeting. This part of the form
lets you give attendees voice-access to your meeting.
People who attend your meeting can use an Internet Phone connection, the
WebEx teleconferencing service, or another teleconferencing service to con-
nect. But participants are not required to use a phone connection at all; this
makes sense if they don’t need to interact with you but just want to view
your presentation online.
54
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

When you go to the Teleconference Settings page, as shown in Figure 4-3, you
can configure the following settings:
 Whether to use an Internet Phone connection. This is VoIP (Voice over
Internet Protocol) technology that lets you make phone calls from your
computer over a broadband Internet connection with no phone line 
present.
 Which (if any) teleconference service to use — WebEx’s own or a third
party’s. If you choose a third party, you have to enter various access
numbers, pass codes, and other instructions to connect.
 If using WebEx’s teleconference service, whether to allow international
call-in numbers.
 If using WebEx’s teleconference service, whether attendees should call
in or receive a call back
Note that you can offer both VoIP and teleconference options for your 
meeting — they aren’t mutually exclusive. Customize these settings to your
liking and then click Next to proceed to the next section.
It might interest your accounting department to know that VoIP can save you
lots of money because you don’t incur standard phone line long distance
charges. When you won’t much interaction between attendees and presenter,
consider using VoIP as your connection method of choice.

Chapter 4: Setting Up Your Very First Meeting

You’re invited!
To invite people, you can select their names from an address book or enter
them as new contacts. Note that the company Address Book is typically cre-
ated and maintained by your Site Administrator, as I describe in Chapter 13.
People whom you invite to meetings receive an e-mail notification that con-
tains a link that they click to join the meeting. The notification also advises
them to download the Meeting Manager client software before the meeting
and also tells them how to go about doing that.
Note that you don’t actually have to invite anybody to a meeting to schedule
it. Instead, you can start the meeting and send out invitations to folks from
within the meeting itself. Of course, this assumes that you’ve told these folks
that an invitation is in the offing, to wait for it at their computers, and to join
the meeting promptly when they receive the invitation.
To add invitees to your meeting, in the Invite Attendees page shown in Fig-
ure 4-4, do the following:
1. Click the Select Attendees button.
The Select Attendees page appears (see Figure 4-5).
Figure 4-4:
The Invite

56
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

2. Click the arrow on the Address Book field and choose a different
address book, if you wish.
3. Select names from the list in the left-hand box and then click the
Attendee button to invite folks to the meeting.
The invited attendees are listed in the right-hand box.
4. After you select all the invitees, click OK to close the Select Attendees
window.
5. On the Invite Attendees pages, select any of the three check boxes to
designate the following:
• If a request to verify that invitees have the appropriate rich media
players to view your presentation (as required if you’re using any
UCF objects) should be included in the invitation. Meetings go
much more smoothly when everybody is set up with these players
ahead of time.
• Whether to include or exclude the password information in the
e-mail invitation.
• Whether attendees must have their own account on your business’
WebEx account to attend.
Figure 4-5:
The Select
Attendees

Chapter 4: Setting Up Your Very First Meeting

Note that the last two items in the list above are a great way to enhance your
meeting’s security. Also, if you don’t include password information in the
e-mail invitation and you’re using a password, you have to contact all the
attendees yourself to provide the password.
Once again (say it with me now!), click Next to go to the next page.
If you want to invite somebody as an alternate host, instead of clicking the
Attendee button in Step 3, click the Alternate Host button. An alternate host
takes on all host privileges. You might do this if somebody joins the meeting
who you want to run a portion of the meeting.
Getting folks registered
In some cases, you want to have people register for your meeting. It’s a case
of knowledge being power: Registration not only helps you get a handle on
how many folks will attend, but it also provides you with certain information
about the attendees that might prove useful in planning your meeting and fol-
lowing up after it’s over.
If you leave the default of None selected on the Registration page, as shown
in Figure 4-6, you choose not to register anyone. From here, you might as well
move on to the next page of the scheduling form. If, on the other hand, you
want folks to register, here are the steps to customize your registration form:
1. Select the Require Attendee Registration radio button.
Figure 4-6:

Part II: Always Be Prepared 

2. Select the various check boxes in the columns labeled Obtain Detailed
Attendee Information to choose what items will be included in your
registration form.
3. If you want to have the right to authorize registration, skip to Step 4;
if you want to allow anybody who registers to attend, select the
Automatically Accept All Registration Requests check box.
4. Click Next to proceed.
Welcome. Our agenda today . . .
When you move to the Agenda & Customizable Welcome page (see Figure 4-7),
you can enter agenda items in the Agenda field. What you enter here appears
on the Info page displayed in the meeting. Those invited to the meeting can
review the agenda by clicking the meeting topic on the Browse meeting page.
At that point, they will be asked for the meeting password — if the meeting is
password-protected.
In addition to entering an agenda, you can configure the following settings on
the Agenda & Customizable Welcome page:
 By using the Browse button in the Automatically Share Presentation or
Document Once a Participant Joins the Meeting item and selecting a file,
you can play the file automatically when a person joins the meeting. The
file must be stored in your personal My Files folder on your WebEx site,
and be a UCF file. By using the Browse button here, you can pick a file
that you’ve already stored in My Files or upload one to that folder and
convert it at this time. You can also control the automatic playback by
choosing either the Start Automatically or Continuous Play box. You can

To register or not to register . . .
When would you not accept a registration to a
meeting? Perhaps you are inviting people from
an industry association list but you don’t want
people from a competing company to attend
because you’re discussing a new product line.
Or perhaps it’s not appropriate to have people
from a certain locale attend because their site
won’t be involved in the project under discus-
sion. When excluding attendees this way, be
sure to include the necessary information in the
registration form, such as Company Name or
State, that rules out your excluded attendees.
Keep in mind that if you specify that registration
requests are automatically approved and you’ve
set up a password, you just undermined your
own security. That’s because after registrants
are approved, they don’t have to enter a pass-
word to join the meeting after it’s started.

also choose the interval of time before your presentation advances or
allow participants to control the playback themselves.
 Specify whether you want Meeting Center to display a Quick Start page
for the host and any presenters. This is a page that helps people making
presentations quickly access common commands such as sharing a 
document.
Note that when you use the Browse button to specify a file to display, you can
select a file that you already uploaded to the My Files area of your WebEx
site, or you can upload one from another source. However, remember that
any file you choose must be in the WebEx Universal Communication Format
(UCF) format.
After you finish entering your agenda and adjusting settings for what appears
when somebody joins the meeting, click Next.
We’ve always got options
Not every meeting requires the same bells and whistles. For example, you
might not want to make the chat feature available if you’re giving a one-way
presentation and don’t want to deal with a lot of questions. Or, you might not
want your presenter to be able to record the meeting. The Meeting Options
page is where you make those choices.
Figure 4-7:
The Agenda
& Customiz-
able
Welcome
page.
60
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

The first category that you deal with on this page is the Meeting Options (see
Figure 4-8). Here’s a rundown of the options that you can choose:
 Chat: Allows people to use the text-messaging feature to communicate
during the meeting. Attendees can chat with the presenter and other
attendees.
 Video: Controls use of either a single-point or multi-point video stream,
which appears on the Video panel. Single-point allows only the presenter
to send live video. Multi-point allows the presenter and up to three other
participants to send live video during the meeting. Multi-point is an option
that your company might or might not have bought into, so check with
your system administrator.
 Notes: Lets a single person or all attendees take notes in the Notes
panel. You can control this and switch between the two options during
the meeting itself. Notes can be printed out at the end of the meeting
(use the Meeting menu, Options command) and could form the basis of
meeting minutes.
 Enable Closed Captioning: Allows one participant to enter closed cap-
tioning comments during the meeting. Closed captions are then pub-
lished to all participants each time that the transcriber presses Enter.
 File Transfer: Specifies that the presenter can publish files that atten-
dees can then download during the meeting.
 Recording: Makes recording features available during the meeting. The
host and presenter can record the meeting, and participants can use the
recording feature if they have recording privileges (set by your trusty
site administrator).
 Send Feedback Form to Host Email: Just what it says. When the meet-
ing ends, a feedback form appears on which attendees can tell you about
their meeting experience. This setting directs those forms to the host’s
e-mail address.
 Enable UCF Rich Media for Attendees: Allows attendees to share rich
media files in the WebEx UCF format (if they have the Share Documents
privilege).
Note the two additional settings on this page:
 Entry and Exit Tone: Choose from this drop-down list whether you wish
a signal — a beep or an announcement of the person’s name — to sound
when somebody joins the meeting. This is sounded through the phone
line only if you use the WebEx integrated teleconferencing option. You
also can choose None, which means that you won’t hear a thing when
somebody joins your meeting. Note that the new attendee’s name appears
on the participants’ list, so you’ll know when somebody’s joined.
61
Chapter 4: Setting Up Your Very First Meeting

 Mirror Options: If you want to let attendees explore the meeting envi-
ronment, displaying different panels (such as chat or video) as they
wish, select the second option: Attendees Can Independently Control
Panels and Views. If you want to force attendees to follow along with you
and see what you choose to display, remove their free will by selecting
the first option, All Attendees Mirror the Presenter’s Panels and View.
Click Next when you’re done with these settings.
It’s a privilege
On the Attendee Privileges page that appears, as shown in Figure 4-9, you
have a whole bunch of check boxes to choose from. These endow certain
privileges on attendees, such as whether they can print, annotate, or save
documents that you share in meetings; whether they can control shared
applications or Web browsers; and whether they can participate in chat.
Some of these are selected by default; others aren’t. Click the ones that are
preselected that you want to deselect, and mark the ones that aren’t selected
if you want to select them.
Those are all the choices available to you, but note that you can change privi-
leges after the meeting gets underway. Choose the Participant menu and then
the Assign Privileges command to do so.
Now it’s time to make sure you got things right, and to get the meeting going.

The final page in the meeting scheduling sequence is the Review page. This
shows you all the choices you just made (see Figure 4-10). If you see that
something’s amiss, just click one of the numbered items on the right and go
back and make changes.
When you’re happy with your meeting settings, you have three options:
 If you didn’t specify a date and time, click the Start button to start the
meeting immediately.
 If you specified a date and time for the meeting, click the Schedule
button. A page appears, as shown in Figure 4-11, confirming that you
have successfully scheduled your meeting. Click the MyWebEx link here.
Or, when you are ready to meet, just go back to the Meeting Center area
of WebEx, locate the meeting through the Attend a Meeting menu, and
click the meeting link. When the meeting overview appears, click the
Start Now button.

your meeting begins. You can then invite attendees using the Participants
menu in the meeting itself.
You can click on the One-Click Meeting tab in the My WebEx My Meetings

Taking Advantage of
Remote Computers
In This Chapter
 Downloading and setting up Access Anywhere
 Connecting to a remote computer
 Working remotely
 Disconnecting when you’re done
You can choose to take advantage of a WebEx feature called Access
Anywhere™.  This is an apt name because this program allows you to
access any computer, from anywhere. You install and set up Access Anywhere
on one computer (the remote computer), and then you can access that com-
puter from any other computer (the local computer, the one you’re working on
when you access the remote computer).
This simple process makes amazing things possible. For instance
 You can access your PC remotely. If, say, you’re at a customer site in
New York and you forgot a very important file that is stored on your
computer at your home office in San Francisco, this comes in pretty
handy. (And no one has to know. You can turn the remote computer’s
screen blank so no one can see the data you are accessing if they walk
by your cube.)
 You can show an application or transfer any document stored on your
computer back at the office while you’re on the road.
In this chapter, I explain how to download and set up Access Anywhere so
you’re all ready to go. Then I get into the mechanics of running a computer
remotely outside of/during a meeting or session.

Setting Up a Remote Computer
You scheduled your meeting and prepared attendees. There’s one more thing
that you might need to do before the meeting starts: Set up access to a remote
computer.
Imagine you’re in Tallahassee for a convention, and you have to run a project
team meeting. You’d like the team to see something in your project manage-
ment application, which is saved on the desktop of your computer back at
the office. No problem. If you want other people attending a meeting to view
applications or a desktop located on a remote computer, you can. All you
need is the WebEx Access Anywhere Agent installed on the remote computer.
Your minimum requirements
Before you go to the trouble of downloading Access Anywhere, you should
verify that both your computer and the computer that you want to hook up
to meet the minimum requirements for using it. Here they are:
 Microsoft Windows 95, 98, Millennium Edition (Me), XP, NT, or 2000
 Intel Pentium 166 MHz or faster processor
 32MB (64MB recommended) of RAM
 Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x or later, Netscape Navigator 4.x or later,
or AOL 5.0 or later
 JavaScript and cookies enabled on the Web browser, and ActiveX
enabled if you are using Internet Explorer
 A dedicated broadband Internet connection, such as digital subscriber
line (DSL), cable modem, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), or
a T1 connection
If you want to install Access Anywhere on a computer running Windows NT
or 2000, you must have administrator privileges on the computer/network.
Downloading Access Anywhere
Follow these steps to download the Access Anywhere Agent:
1. Click the My Computer link on the left side of the My WebEx screen.
2. Click the Set Up Computer button.
The Setting Up WebEx Access Anywhere window displays a progress bar
as Access Anywhere downloads to your computer. (This could take as
long as 10 minutes.)
68
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

Setting up Access Anywhere
After the download in the previous section is complete, a WebEx Access
Anywhere Setup Wizard window appears. Click Next to begin the wizard, and
then follow these steps to set up Access Anywhere:
1. Enter a name for the computer, as well as WebEx account information
including the URL for your WebEx account, User Name, and Password
in the form shown in Figure 5-1. Then click Next.
2. Select the various check boxes to adjust the settings for your remote
session (especially the settings for how the remote computer will per-
form when it is being accessed) on the Options page that appears, as
shown in Figure 5-2, and then click Next.
You can also make changes to these options while running an Access
Anywhere session.
I strongly recommend that you leave the Disable This Computer’s
Keyboard and Mouse option selected in the Session Options. This
ensures that nobody at the remote computer can start to play around
with it while you’re in control. It’s also a good idea to enable the Disable
Pop-up Messages option because if a pop-up appears while you’re work-
ing, you can’t control it (that is, close it) from a distance.
3. In the Applications window that appears, select the radio button for
either the Entire Desktop or for Specific Applications. Then click Next.
If you choose Specific Applications, click the Add button, and choose
the application that you want to be able to access from the list that
appears. Then click Select to place it on the list before clicking Next.

4. In the Authentication window, choose the authentication method:
Access Code or Phone.
• If you choose Phone, the settings shown in Figure 5-3 appear.
Making this choice causes the remote computer to call you when-
ever you try to access it remotely.
• Choosing Access Code displays the settings shown in Figure 5-4, in
which you can enter an Access Code that you supply whenever
you want to access the computer remotely.
5. Set your phone number and pass code or your access code and then
click Next.
The final dialog box appears confirming that the computer has been set
up for remote access.

Working Remotely
After you install Access Anywhere on the remote computer, you’re ready to
tap into it from across town or around the world through the magic of the
Internet. This section shows you how.
Making the connection
To remotely access the computer that you set up with Access Anywhere, it
must be connected to the Internet, and the Access Anywhere Agent has to be
running. (Ask the department assistant to do it for you while you’re in Florida.)
First, here’s how to connect to a remote computer if you’re not in a WebEx
session or meeting:
1. Display the My WebEx page on your WebEx site.
2. Click the My Computers link.
The My WebEx Computers list, as shown in Figure 5-6, appears.
3. Click the Connect link for the computer that you wish to connect to.
If you choose Applications when you set up Access Anywhere, a list of
applications appears. Click the Connect button for the one that you want
to use. If you chose the Entire Desktop option, you won’t see this list.
Figure 5-6:
The remote
computer(s)

72
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

If you chose phone authentication, the remote computer calls you.
Provide your pass code, following the voice instructions that you hear.
If you are accessing a computer that runs Windows NT or 2000, a window
appears for you to log in as administrator.
The Access Anywhere in Progress page appears in a window. Leave this
window open, or you’ll end your connection. Finally, the Access Anywhere
window opens, revealing either the application that you selected or the
remote computer’s desktop.
You can connect to a remote computer while running a meeting, and all meet-
ing members can view the remote desktop. You do this by choosing Share➪
Remote Computer from the Meeting window. Note that the commands avail-
able on the Access Anywhere menu differ somewhat when you share a
remote computer during a meeting.
Remotely working
After you connect to a remote computer, you can work with it almost as if
you were sitting in front of it. In addition to working on the computer, you
have some Access Anywhere commands to help you out. Notice the little
Access Anywhere button in the upper-right corner. Click this button to dis-
play a menu of choices (see Figure 5-7).
The items on this menu are
 Transfer File: This option allows you to send files to and from the
remote computer. This command opens the File Transfer window (see
Figure 5-8). Browse to find the file that you want on either computer, and
then use the right- or left-pointing arrow buttons to transfer files from
one computer to the other.
 View: This opens a submenu with various settings for zooming in or out
of the remote screen at various settings (such as 75% or 200%). 
 Remote Computer: This option includes a submenu of commands:
• Make Screen Blank
• Disable Keyboard and Mouse
Figure 5-7:
The Access
Anywhere
menu
options.
73
Chapter 5: Taking Advantage of Remote Computers

• Reduce Screen Resolution to Match This Computer
• Send Ctrl+Alt+Del
The first three of these commands are settings that you chose when
you set up the remote computer; choosing one of them from this menu
changes that setting for this one session but not for the computer con-
nection as a whole. So, for example, if you did not choose to disable the
keyboard and mouse when setting up the computer but you choose to
disable them here, the next time you connect, they will be enabled
according to the overall remote computer settings.
The last command allows you to initiate a Ctrl+Alt+Del action on any
Windows NT or 2000 computer.
 End Access Anywhere Session: Choose this command to end this ses-
sion and disconnect from the remote computer.
If you’re accessing a remote computer application, the Remote Computer
menu includes the command Bring Shared Application to Front. This is a
shortcut to restore a shared application that you minimized or to bring it to
the front of other application windows that you might have opened.
If you disable the remote computer’s keyboard and mouse, when you end the
Access Anywhere session, they are automatically enabled again.

Preparing for a Dynamic
Marketing Event
In This Chapter
 Planning a presentation that works online
 Managing the enrollment process
 Avoiding technical difficulties
 Creating an event strategy
 Promoting your event
 Following a pre-event checklist
 Making your event interesting
I
n the previous chapters of this book, I introduce you to WebEx Meeting
Center and help you with the ins and outs of scheduling your first meet-
ing. But before I let you loose in an actual meeting, I have a few things to say
about preparing for a successful presentation.
Most of the advice in this chapter deals with preparing for a big time market-
ing event through Event Center. Many organizations derive a substantial per-
centage of their sales leads from informative online events. But don’t think
for a minute that this advice applies only to splashy marketing launches.
Except for the most compulsory staff meeting, to get people into your com-
pany meeting, training session, product announcement, or sales event, you
have to give them a compelling reason to come. Then, it’s up to you to be pre-
pared by creating an exciting presentation, practicing it, and planning all the
technical details so there are no glitches.
Pushing the Marketing Envelope
Many companies spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on advertising
agencies and product launch event consultants, but neglect to put all but the
most basic planning efforts into online events. Why? Maybe it’s because they

are relatively inexpensive to produce. Who knows? But before you produce
your first big online event, I want to give you some sound marketing advice,
WebEx style.
Event strategy
Strategy begins at the top, where you target your highest-level goal. Ask your-
self specific questions about your event, such as
 Who do you want to reach?
 What response do you want from them at the end of the event?
 How many responses are you expecting?
 Do you have a specific budget number to work with, or do you have to
request your budget after you’ve assessed your needs and likely return
on investment (ROI)?
 What topic is relevant and interesting to your target audience?
Picking just the right date
Picking the right date for an important event is something of an art. Some
guidelines seem obvious, such as avoiding holidays, and the days immedi-
ately preceding them. Other maxims of veteran date pickers are less obvious.
For example, consider that
 Mondays and Fridays average lower attendance than Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, and Thursdays.
 You should avoid times when your target audience is generally unavail-
able (for example, at the end of month for Finance, or in August for acad-
emic types).
 Events held in the last two weeks of your quarter typically receive less
sales support, because those folks are usually busy closing business
rather than prospecting.
 Events held early in the quarter have a better chance of raising sales in
that quarter.
 Event times between 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time generally get
the best national attendance.
How many people is enough?
Should you hold an intimate event with just your most golden prospects or
clients? Would a huge meeting with global presence make more of a splash?
And even if you decide that a mere 100 people would be the perfect number
76
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

for your event, how do you guarantee that you’ll get 100 people to attend?
(Remember that party you threw in high school when you invited 35 people
and 5 came? I still shudder at the thought of all that leftover Cheez Whiz and
punch).
The bottom line for planning attendance is to calculate how many invitations
to send and determine how targeted your invitation list is. There are some
common assumptions about response rates, enrollment rates, attendance
rates and lead ratios you want to consider when deciding how many invita-
tions to send to reach a certain audience size goal. Your response rate will
vary depending on a variety of factors including the
 Richness of your purchased or owned e-mail list
 Use of unsolicited lists versus known leads
 Resonance of your event title and description to your target audience
 Quality of your invitation copy
 Ability of your invitation to get past spam filters
 Appeal of your brand and any guest speakers
 Amount of advance notice you provide your invitees
 Time and day of the week your event is scheduled for
 Ease of the registration process
The rule of thumb is that you get a better response rate from lists of people
who already know your organization than from “cold” lists you buy or rent
from some third party. But for the sake of argument, take a look at the num-
bers when using a relatively cold invitation list.
If you do a pretty good job of planning and promoting your event, on average
you can assume you need to send 100 invitations for each enrollee. Typically
40–60 percent of enrollees will attend. These statistics, of course, change dra-
matically for the better if you are holding an event for employees who are
required to attend or with whom you have an existing relationship, such as
your customer base.
E-mail campaigns are frequently used to promote Web seminars, which makes
sense because those who communicate online often are probably more com-
fortable learning online.
Strategizing for sales
If your event is meant to generate sales, you should be aware before you start
your meeting what you can expect to gain from it.
77
Chapter 6: Preparing for a Dynamic Marketing Event

Here’s how online events typically relate to follow-on sales:
 Typically 5–15 percent of attendees will qualify as “A” (likely to buy
soon) leads.
 A similar fraction will also qualify as “B” (interested but with a less
urgent need) leads.
 A lesser percentage of those who enroll but do not attend are likely to
qualify as “A” and “B” leads, as well.
Your sales conversion rate is highly dependent on what you have to offer;
even the snappiest online meeting can’t sell bad merchandise or out-of-date
materials. That said, 15 percent is a common sales conversion rate. A gross
assumption suggests you’ll close 1–5 sales per 10,000 e-mail invitations.
You are also likely to benefit if you get prospects who are already in the sales
pipeline to come to your event. Even if they don’t attend because they are
familiar with your offering, they may refer others to it.
Planning the numbers
So what’s all this going to cost? WebEx offers a calculator to help you estimate
the cost and likely ROI for your event, and your account rep will be happy to
make suggestions about how to enhance your ROI. The key is to increase your
total effect (gain) and efficiently manage your expenses (costs), thereby
improving your ROI.
Here are some items to consider when creating an event budget:
 Determine your target audience, the desired response you want from
attendees, and the number of attendees you hope to reach.
 Decide on the most interesting and relevant topic and speaker(s) to
attract enrollment and get attendees to give you the desired response.
 Design an event promotion campaign to reach your ideal target audience.
 Determine the amount of time you’ll need to define, promote, design,
and prepare the event (six weeks is a good start with larger events).
 Select the best event date.
 Calculate the promotion, content creation, Web seminar, and telephony
costs, as well as the cost of inducements and follow-ups.
Don’t neglect techniques for leveraging other programs’ budgets. If you have
an ad campaign under way, request a mention, a bullet, an extra insert, or
anything else that provides exposure for your event at little or no extra cost.
If your company is involved in PR activities, make sure it also touts this
event. If you are co-presenting with a partner or industry expert, consider
what promotional activities and mailing lists that person can contribute.
78
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

Are there public interest groups, online forums, or professional associations
that might be willing to mention your event, if it’s related to a topic its mem-
bership would find interesting?
If you are sending invitations using rented or purchased unsolicited lists,
you’ll face some challenges in getting your money’s worth. List brokers are
adding restrictions because of new liability laws that may affect the terms and
conditions of your purchase. Also, be aware that spam filters increasingly
block e-mails, including those with a lot of HTML, a lot of text, and key words
such as free, promotion, special offer, and sale. Always test your invitation
using several spam filters to see if your message is getting through. (On the
bright side, some lists are coming down in price and may offer more value).
Letters, direct mail, brochures, and other related marcom (marketing commu-
nications) pieces should all make note of the event. If they don’t, consider
paying for a sticker to add to existing materials. A sticker is typically cheaper
than a whole new promotional piece, after all, and you can piggyback on in-
place postage or distribution budgets.
Don’t forget to let your employees and sales force know what’s going on.
They should be promoting the session in every appropriate interaction.
Asking attendees all the right questions
The registration process is your first point of contact with enrollees, and you
can use it to strategize about who will join your meeting and whether they
will pay off in future sales or repeat business.
When you design your enrollment form, consider the objective of the event:
Several of your qualifying questions could be very important in establishing
the quality of each lead.
You have the option of assigning a score to each possible enrollment answer
at the time you create your enrollment page. These scores can then be auto-
matically tallied and ranked in reports to help you quickly route the hottest
leads to your Sales team.
Think about how you want to use the description page. From a marketing
point of view, you want the prospective attendee to be intrigued with the con-
tent and have a compelling reason to attend. Include either a logo or a photo
of the presenter to post together with your written description. Consider
adding eye-catching fonts and active HTML links within the body of the
description itself (see Figure 6-1). Don’t forget that you have the ability to
send your enrollee to a URL of your choice when the enrollment form is sub-
mitted. Use this feature to reinforce your message and branding.
79
Chapter 6: Preparing for a Dynamic Marketing Event

You can set up the enrollment to allow for either instant approval or a pre-
approval review. WebEx Event Center lets you establish criteria for automatic
approval (for example all those for whom Plan to Buy = “In the next 30 days”)
or automatic rejection (when an e-mail address contains @competitor.com,
give them the boot, for example). This automated feature can reduce your
labor and turn-around time on approvals.
Don’t forget: Reminders
It’s essential to map out a reminder campaign to keep the event foremost in
the attendees’ minds and get them into your event.
When you schedule an event, you can customize any of the e-mail messages
that Event Center sends to event invitees, enrollees, and attendees. 
Follow these steps to set up reminders:
1. On the Schedule an Event page, in the E-mail Options section (see
Figure 6-2), select the check box for the e-mail messages that you
want to send to confirm enrollment or send updates on the event:
• Enrollment Pending 
• Enrollment Accepted 
• Enrollment Rejected 
• Event Updated
Figure 6-1:
A catchy

80
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

2. Select checkboxes in the following two categories: 
• Reminder: You can send up to two reminders and choose the date
and time to send them.
• Follow-up: You can send a thank you to attendees after the event,
and a follow-up message to those who enrolled but did not attend.
Again, you choose the date and time for delivery of these messages.
3. Click the link for any e-mail message to open the Edit Email Message
window; click Save to save any changes.
When you customize the content of an e-mail message, you can use sev-
eral variables that Event Center automatically replaces with information
about the event when sending the message. For example, you can use
the variable %Topic%, which Event Center automatically replaces with
the event name specified on the Schedule an Event page. You can also
restore an e-mail template by clicking the Restore to Default button.
4. Click the Schedule button to save all the event schedule settings.
The Event Information is displayed.
5. In the Emails Messages section of this form, select checkboxes to
choose those you wish to e-mail an invitation: Host, Panelists,
Participants, or Vendors.
6. Click the Send Emails button at the bottom of the Event Information
form.
Your invitation e-mails are sent, and all reminder e-mails you scheduled
on the previous form will be sent when you scheduled them to be.
Figure 6-2:
Here you set
various
e-mail
options.
81
Chapter 6: Preparing for a Dynamic Marketing Event

Here are some things you can do in the WebEx Event Center that can help
you drive such reminders:
 Design and post the event description and information on your Web site
to get visitors excited.
 Generate enrollment reports so you can map your progress.
 Use host-controlled, automated, customizable e-mails to provide connec-
tion information and reminders to attendees.
 Use something called viral marketing tools (for example, automated links
in attendee e-mails that they can use to forward invitations to others) to
encourage attendees to spread the word (like a virus, hence the term
viral) and invite other interested friends to the event. Invitees can
submit names of interested parties or forward information to them.
 Add visually appealing elements to your Event Center site including
graphics, text, and enrollment information.
 Come up with a compelling event title and description.
 Consider creating a program of related events to promote at the same
time. (This can provide additional perceived value, increased mind-
share, and cost savings.)
 Review reports leading up to the session to be prepared for the probable
number of attendees (remember, typically 40–60 percent of enrollees
attend).
 Schedule and draft automated thank-you-for-attending messages, and
sorry-you-couldn’t-make-it e-mails (see Figure 6-3).

cally

82
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

Statistically, sending two reminders e-mailed 24 hours and 1 hour in advance
of the event, has the greatest benefit.
For some event topics and audiences, it may make financial sense to leave tele-
phone reminders a day or two in advance of the event. Yes, this involves extra
cost and time; the benefit is that this contact often adds an extra psychological
dimension, which can cause a noticeable increase in attendance rates.
An offer they can’t refuse
Don’t you just love special offers? Today only . . . 15 percent off . . . buy one,
get one free! If the purpose of your Web event is to gather qualified leads and
increase sales, be sure to plan a little something special for attendees. Your
offer can be discounted products or services, a free demo or consultation, or
simply an incentive to speak with a sales rep. Mention your special offer at
the beginning and end of your event, as well as during the presentation, if
appropriate.
One great way to make responding to an offer instantaneous is to use a Web
push. This WebEx feature enables you to deliver a Web page to attendees’
computer screens that they can control and navigate. This really cool tool
allows your attendees to register an incentive offer, provide information, and
offer feedback about the event on the spot. Ask your system administrator
about how to go about this for your service.
You can also set up a drop-off URL that displays a Web page when each
attendee leaves the event or when the event ends. Use this feature to send
your attendees to a special offer form. Then pass those forms on to your
sales folks.
Promote, promote, promote
Old-time carnivals had quick-talking folks called barkers standing outside
tents, convincing people to step inside and see the show. You have to become
a 21st-century virtual barker for your event. Luckily, technology puts a lot
more promotion tools at your disposal than our sideshow friends had.
Leave no stone unturned in your efforts to spread the word about your Web
event and drive prospects and customers to your enrollment page. Some of
the media successfully used to promote Web events include
 E-mail
 Direct Mail
 Newsletters
83
Chapter 6: Preparing for a Dynamic Marketing Event

 Advertising on your Web site
 Online advertising at sites where potential attendees visit
 Links to your event from related sites
 Telephone
 Home page placements
 Banner ads
 Personal sales rep invitations
 Public relations
 Ad tie-ins
 Viral marketing
Invite your prospect base, customers, and partners using the medium that
most effectively gets to your audience. For example, many companies adver-
tise Web seminars in a customer newsletter, which is sent to each new cus-
tomer. Always be careful about respecting those who want to opt-out and
make sure that your e-mails include the necessary opt-out links and company
information.
In your e-mail, newsletter items, and direct mail, make the Web seminar your
main call to action and the focus of the creation/design. Emphasize the title,
date, and time and make sure that any URL you provide easily directs visitors
to the enrollment page.
You can use your internal mailing lists or purchase lists. Be sure you adver-
tise the event on your Web site, customer/partner information sites, and
industry portals.
Look for third-party sponsors that will send an e-mail to its mailing list for a
fee or in exchange for being listed as a sponsor in your promotional materials.
E-mails and newsletters sent by a third party to its opt-in lists can generate
more interest if the third party is a key player in the industry or is a trusted
association or name. This approach also avoids the list rental process.
Making the announcement
If you send out your event announcement the day before the event, I guaran-
tee you’ll be disappointed with the attendance. They say timing is everything,
so time your promotional messages appropriately. Promotion should begin
three to four weeks before the scheduled date. Send out reminders and
announcements for both prospects and enrollees one week, one day, and one
hour before the event. Also include “tell a friend” links so that your target
84
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

audience can invite others who might be interested. If you’ve got the people
power, call enrollees the day before to personally remind them of the event.
Specify lead-source tracking ID’s on your promotional materials to measure
which sources are getting people to follow through and enroll. You may double
your efforts with the winning sources even before the event to boost atten-
dance. As you continue to market to this target audience for future events, this
information can be invaluable for fine-tuning your promotional strategy.
85
Chapter 6: Preparing for a Dynamic Marketing Event
When you’re in a hurry
When is the last time you had more than enough
time? It’s inevitable: There will be times when
you need to plan and set up a large event in less
than the optimum six weeks.
In general, the more experienced you are at
conducting online events, the faster you can
determine your strategy, set up your event, and
promote it. But even if you’re new to online
events, here are some short cuts and excep-
tions to help you out:
 If you are repeating an event you have con-
ducted before, you can essentially skip
many of the planning steps and jump to
designing your promotion and initiating your
promotional campaign. This can reduce
lead-time to about three weeks.
 If you are promoting an event to a “friendly”
audience (for example, customers, part-
ners, association members who know you,
and so on), you may get by on less than
three weeks promotion time. Keep in mind
though, that most people book their calen-
dars one or more weeks ahead, so the less
lead-time you give them, the less chance
that they’ll be available.
 If you are planning a series of related
events as a single program, those events
can share a single strategy phase, design,
setup, and event promotion phase. The
events themselves can be days or even
hours apart.
 Use promotional media where you have
more control over how soon your message
is delivered. For example, don’t send an
announcement by regular mail — the speed
at which regular mail arrives at its destina-
tion varies according to the how far it has
to travel and the time of year it is sent.
Instead, use media such as newspaper ads
with a specific insertion dates, or e-mailed
announcements that will arrive at most
inboxes within 24 hours. This minimizes lag
time between creating the event and pro-
moting it.
 Be realistic about your resources. If you
don’t have the time or resources to optimize
every part of the event process, focus on
your areas of greatest strength that will get
you the highest attendance.
 If you can recruit creative or logistical talent
from any group in your organization that
stands to gain from a successful event, you
may be able to divvy up the workload and
race through the strategy and setup phases
more quickly.
 If all else fails, consider bringing in a hired
gun. WebEx Production Services may be
able to help you out on a short lead-time
and ensure a smoother experience for your
speakers and attendees.

Follow up
Promotion doesn’t end with your event. Here are some things to consider
after the meeting ends:
 Schedule a calling campaign by your sales force for one to three days
after the event to qualified attendees and enrollees.
 Create a PDF version of the final presentation and send it out to attendees.
 Assemble event-specific sales scripts for follow-up calls and sales collat-
eral materials, such as informational press kits that you can mail out to
assist sales reps in converting attendees into purchasers.
 Schedule a marketing special-offer e-mail one week after the event.
 Organize event attendee data and quickly distribute it to appropriate
people for action.
Being Prepared
You wouldn’t want to plan a terrific promotional campaign for your event and
then lay an egg, would you? Make sure your event presentation delivers on
your promotional promise by planning the content and logistics carefully.
Planning your presentation to work online
Chances are, you’ve stood up before a group of people before spouting words
of wisdom as you clicked through a bullet point presentation. You used ges-
tures, facial expressions, and your powers of observation to pick up on how
your audience was reacting to you. With an online presentation, you may have
quite a large group of people, but they will only hear your voice and see your
slide presentation. This means that in an online event, your slides become
even more important than in an in-person presentation.
You may already know these presentation guidelines:
 Use no more than four to six bullet points per slide
 Use clean, simple fonts and not too many colors
 Include transitions and animation to drive home points and emphasize
key messages.
86
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

But online presentations have their own set of rules, including:
 Keep slides moving briskly because they’re all the audience has to look
at (except a Minesweeper game they can bring up on screen if your pre-
sentation gets dull); allow about one minute per slide.
 People are used to getting up-to-the-minute information online: The
information you present should be timely and target what your audience
needs today. The best online seminars are about new trends or current
changes in the relevant industry.
 Be sure to include relevant examples and case studies; bring in customer
success stories and experts from your organization to add value. This
might be information you would normally include in your patter, but with
an online presentation, consider preparing a video of a customer testimo-
nial or sharing an application or Web site to give a product demonstration.
 Consider how polling and chat will blend into the flow of the meeting.
Also, think about Q & A: Will questions be interspersed or come all at
the end (at the end is easier)?
 Storyboard the presentation using all these elements to ensure a tight
Webinar (a “Web seminar”) that keeps the audience’s attention.
Making your event engaging
Businesspeople today are exposed to a lot of presentations, from those they
encounter in their own company meetings to training sessions and industry
conferences (not to mention the in-mirror TV screen in the airport bathroom).
They can be pretty jaded about what makes for an interesting presentation, so
you have your work cut out for you.
One way to grab attention is to design your theme as a question, for which
the logical answer is your call to action. The call to action is the next step
you want attendees to take, to walk down the path towards making a pur-
chase, putting a new job skill to work, or using a service. You are alerting
your audience to a problem or opportunity. Think of it this way: If you inspire
them to want to act on this information, what is the obvious action you
would take if you were a member of the audience?
Sample calls to action are
 Request a one-to-one consultation with one of our experts today!
 Contact an account rep to see how others in your industry have suc-
ceeded with our product or service!
87
Chapter 6: Preparing for a Dynamic Marketing Event

 Use our online cost-savings calculator to see how much you can save!
 Order by the end of the month and save 30 percent!
 Call today for a free trial/demo/sample!
Right at the outset, you should outline the valuable, interesting, and com-
pelling benefits of sitting through the entire seminar to the audience. Include
some tempting nuggets and some specific examples of the valuable informa-
tion they will gain to establish that your seminar is worthwhile. Remember,
these folks can “walk out” of your meeting at any time if they don’t see the
value in staying.
Conduct polls early and intermittently. A popular technique is to poll the
audience after the second or third slide to find out what area is of the great-
est interest. This has many benefits. It hints at the multiple ways that the pre-
sentation is of value. It lets audience members see what others are interested
in. Most importantly, it prompts them to interact and lets you assure them
that you will tailor your comments to their needs. This can be a very power-
ful way to engage them through an online medium. Additional polls through-
out the session continue to keep them engaged and add value by making the
live audience part of the show.
Real-world examples are particularly valuable for helping audience members
absorb and assimilate abstract concepts. The more credible and concrete
you can make your case, the fewer audience members will duck out the back
during your presentation.
In general, a 30- to 35-minute presentation is your best bet for marketing sem-
inars. If the seminar is too short, attendees may not feel they’ve received sub-
stantial value. If the presentation is too long, a lot of the audience won’t hang
around for your call to action at the end. Or, the audience may be so satu-
rated and fatigued that they feel less vigorous about responding to your call
to action. It’s also a good idea to leave at least ten minutes for Q&A after the
presentation.
Use more than one speaker if possible. A male and a female speaker subcon-
sciously attract extra attention so if, like Noah, you have one of each avail-
able, pick them as your speaker duo.
Making enrolling easy and rewarding
Admit it: If you didn’t absolutely have to file your taxes every year, you’d take
one look at that 1040 form and skip the whole thing, right? A bad form can
stop a potential attendee in his or her tracks in the same way. Conversely, a
simple enrollment form can maximize registrations for your event.
88
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

When you schedule an event, you can save yourself a little time by using the
Copy From link next to the Event name field in the Schedule an Event form.
This copies any customized enrollment form you’ve used in other events,
saving you the effort necessary to recustomize it every time.
Designing the form
In the Schedule an Event form there’s a section for Enrollment. In this section
you can set requirements for enrollment ID and password requirements, and
designate whether approval of the enrollment form is required before some-
one can attend. There’s also a Customize Enrollment Form button. To make
your form just the way you want it, click that button, and then follow these
steps:
1. Use the first column of checkboxes next to the items lists (such First
Name, Last Name, Address, and so on) to include or exclude those
fields from the form (see Figure 6-4).
2. Use the second column of checkboxes (the one labeled with an “R” at
the top) to indicate the items that are required to complete the form.
3. Depending on what you’d like to add, click on any of these five buttons
at the bottom of the form: Text Box, Check Boxes, Option Buttons, Drop-
Down List.
Figure 6-4:
Customizing
fields. Many
of these
items are
preselected
for you.
89
Chapter 6: Preparing for a Dynamic Marketing Event

In the form that appears fill out the appropriate information. For a
checkbox, for example, enter a label for the set of checkboxes, and
labels for each individual box. If you like, add a score to each item; you
can use this score to automatically approve or reject an enrollment. For
a drop-down list, you enter the label for the list, and a label for each item
that appears in the list.
4. When you’ve finished entering labels, click the Save button.
5. To add questions you’ve created for other events, click the My Saved
Questions button, click on the checkbox for the question(s) you want
to include, and then click the Add button.
6. When you’ve finished adding questions to the form, click the Save
button.
Providing a clear, to-the-point overview
When creating an enrollment form, you get a chance to enter an event
description. This is your hook to get people to want to attend, to want to fill
out the enrollment form and submit it.
Consider these pointers about writing a dynamic description:
 Stress the value for those who attend, not the sales pitch.
 Include bullet points for easy scanning.
 Include speaker bios so attendees get to know the expert(s)/speaker(s).
 Make the topic and goal of the session clear.
 Point out anything that will go beyond an online bullet point presenta-
tion, such as sharing of documents, applications, or Web content; video;
or interaction.
Showing them an event face
Online events can often have a faceless quality (making people feel they have
to talk to the technology, so to speak). Try to make the event seem more per-
sonal by branding the enrollment form with company logos and including pic-
tures of the people who will be presenting.
Making it easy for them
Your enrollment form is a place for enrollees to do a last check that this is the
right event for them before they sign up. List fees, if any, technical require-
ments, or a link to an FAQ where questions can be answered.
Your enrollment page is also an excellent place to qualify attendees, but don’t
bombard them with questions. A few questions — no more than 15 — help
you better understand your audience and you can actually shape your pre-
sentation to match their needs (see Figure 6-5).
90
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

Using an auto-populated registration form, which pre-populates the answer
fields on the enrollment form, makes the registration process for your cus-
tomers and prospects a snap!
Practice, practice, practice
You know the old joke about how to get to Carnegie Hall: Practice, practice,
practice! The same is true for online meetings. At least one week before the
Web event
 All speakers should meet online to do a complete “dry run.”
 Review slides, practice transitions, test any rich media being used, and
practice using the online tools and features.
 It’s important to use the same computer equipment you’ll be using in
the actual event and to make sure that the speakers know how and when
they need to join the actual event.
 Make sure speakers actually go through their spoken presentations,
including the use of their slides. Participating in an online event is a
unique experience, and practice makes perfect.
 Practice verbal transitions if there are multiple speakers (you can’t look at
each other to get visual cues). The host/moderator should be prepared to
pass Presenter control from one speaker to another when needed.
Figure 6-5:

91
Chapter 6: Preparing for a Dynamic Marketing Event

The most common feedback from first-time online presenters, including those
who have a lot of public speaking experience, is how difficult it is to speak to
a computer. With no visual or audio feedback from the audience, even a sea-
soned public speaker can become uneasy. But with a little practice, even the
novice presenter can become an effective online speaker.
Schedule another dry run the day before the event just to make sure every-
thing will run smoothly when you go live.
Start your Web event 30 minutes ahead of the scheduled start time to give
attendees a chance to sign on and the presenters a chance to get prepared.
Plan to keep attendees occupied with a video or details about a special offer
until the actual start of the meeting.
Avoiding technical glitches
When was the last time you made a live presentation and didn’t have a tech-
nical glitch? The technical requirements for holding a Web event are minimal,
but they are important, so don’t neglect them.
Be prepared by checking well in advance that you have the right equipment
and make sure it’s adjusted correctly by using the following checklist:
 Check your computer. You need a PC with a minimum of 128MB RAM, a
Pentium III or better, and a sound card if you are using VoIP or any rich
media with audio.
 Check your Internet connection. All presenters should have DSL or T1
connections so they can share media at an acceptable speed.
 Check your headsets. Hand-free headsets offer better audio quality than
handsets or speakerphones.
 Check your location. Broadcast your Web event from a quiet office loca-
tion (not the one next door to the fire station) and use your phone’s
mute feature when you’re not speaking.
 Check audio quality. Make sure all speakers are at the same volume
level. Many folks underestimate the importance of having very high
quality audio. In an online presentation, you can’t lip-read (as most of us
unconsciously do with a live speaker), so make sure it’s clear and crisp.
 Check the recording setup. Do a test recording before the event begins
to make sure the audio is actually being recorded.
92
Part II: Always Be Prepared 

If you need to use a lower screen resolution, let your attendees know that
they can scale a presentation to fit their event windows by using Zoom tools
and the Full Screen view. If you’re sharing an application, they can also scale
the view of the application window.
Enough Preparation Already!
Perhaps there is such a thing as being too prepared. At some point, you have
to jump in and run a meeting or host an event. The next part of this book is
where you get going running meetings with Meeting Center, which will make
you hands-on types happy!

In this part . . .
You have watched a demo and scheduled your first
meeting. You’re finally ready to run your first meeting
and discover all the tools and features that WebEx makes
available to you. Here’s where you begin to share docu-
ments, applications, Web content, and even your very
own desktop. You take a poll of attendees, show folks a
video of your own smiling face, and brainstorm like crazy
using the whiteboard feature.
The flip side of the coin is always interesting, too, so in
this part I talk about what it’s like to attend a meeting:
how you dial in, get the presenter’s attention, and save
various items from your meeting.

But even the simplest task can seem daunting the first time you do it — 
especially with lots of other people watching what you do. This chapter pro-
vides all the steps for starting, running, and ending that first meeting. By the
time you’ve read this chapter, you’ll feel like an old pro.
Starting Your Scheduled Meeting
First things first: Get your meeting started. If you already have a meeting
scheduled (see Chapter 4 for all the details of scheduling one, if you haven’t),
you can access it via your WebEx Meeting Service Web site. Here’s how:

1. Go to your WebEx Meeting site.
Enter your WebEx URL in your browser. When your WebEx meeting
site appears, click the Log In button and sign in with your user ID and
password.
2. Click the My WebEx tab.
3. In the list of meetings that appears, click the Start link under the
Status column, as shown in Figure 7-1.
Starting an Instant Meeting
The Web server just crashed, and customers can’t get into their accounts to
check their balances. A quick, high-level meeting is definitely called for, but
you don’t have time to fill out a scheduling form and have people register.
You need a meeting, and you need it now! If this is your situation, don’t
worry. Just use WebEx’s Instant Meeting feature.
The following steps show you how to start a One-Click Meeting:
1. On the Meeting Center tab, click the Instant Meeting link under the
Host a Meeting menu.
The Instant Meeting page, as shown in Figure 7-2, appears.
Click here to start the meeting.

2. Enter the meeting topic, password, password confirmation, and tele-
conferencing options that you prefer.
3. Click the Start button.
A dialog box appears telling you that Meeting Manager is being prepared;
when that’s done, your meeting opens.

Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting
Making sure your attendees are ready to go
In order to participate in a WebEx meeting, all
participants must have installed WebEx
Meeting Manager (the plug-in that makes
WebEx work). I also recommend asking atten-
dees to take part in a 20-minute WebEx tutorial
to ensure two things:
 Basic training. Attendees find out how
WebEx works and are ready to use the
annotation, mute, and other basic features
that the demo discusses. Even ten minutes
of wandering around the demo meeting will
get them comfortable with these features if
they’re short on time.
 Meeting Manager is installed. In order to
participate in the live demo, attendees need
to quickly install the Meeting Manager
plug-in. By having them participate in the
live demo prior to their meeting with you,
you can be sure that everyone is ready to
jump into the meeting right away.
Keep in mind that Meeting Manager has some
options that you can specify as the meeting
host. Check out the Meeting Center Help pages
at http://webex.com/customercare/
downloads-webex.html for more on these
options.

After you start your instant meeting, you can invite attendees by choosing
Participant➪Invite and then choosing a delivery method (by E-mail, by
Phone, or by Messenger). Each invited attendee receives an invitation that
includes information about the meeting and either a link that the attendee
can click to join the meeting or a phone call to hook them into the meeting,
depending on what invitation method you choose.
Getting People to Join Your Meeting
After you have a great topic for your meeting and you schedule the meeting
in WebEx (as I explain in Chapter 4), you need to publicize that meeting and
allow people to join in. The following sections show you how.
Sending a link in e-mail
When you schedule a meeting, anyone whose e-mail address you include in
the list of attendees receives an e-mail with the meeting details and a link to
the meeting. Figure 7-3 shows an example of an e-mail invitation to a sched-
uled meeting.
When the attendee clicks the link, she gets a dialog box asking for a password.
After that is entered, she goes directly to the Meeting Information page in a
Web browser, as shown in Figure 7-4.

Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

Sending people to your personal
WebEx site
As Virginia Wolff said, there’s nothing like a room of one’s own. That could be
why WebEx provides an online meeting room called your Personal Meeting
Room, a customizable space from which you control all your meeting activi-
ties. One simple way to get people to join your meetings is to send them a
link to your Personal Meeting Room site, which shows information about all
the upcoming meetings that you’re hosting. Your site can even include files
that you want to share with people who attend your meetings.
To customize your Personal Meeting Room, click the My Profile link at My
WebEx and make changes in the Personal Meeting Room section, uploading
an image and a welcome message to display.
You can customize your Personal Meeting Room page. Figure 7-5 shows one
example.
To get someone to join a meeting via your Personal Meeting Room site, follow
these steps:
1. In your normal e-mail program, start a new e-mail message addressed
to all the people whom you want to participate in your meeting.
Figure 7-4:
The meeting
information
page (from
the
attendees’
view).
101
Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting

2. In the body of the e-mail, paste a link to your Personal Meeting Room
site.
When attendees arrive, the list of scheduled meetings that you are host-
ing appears.
3. Instruct everyone to click the Join Now link in the Status column, as
shown in Figure 7-5, to join a specific meeting.
As the host, you can turn on the “join before host” feature when scheduling a
meeting to allow your attendees to join up to 15 minutes in advance. This fea-
ture is very useful if your attendees arrive to the meeting early.
As I explain in Chapter 4, you can create a custom welcome message for your
meetings in the Agenda and Customizable Welcome window that appears as
you go through the steps of scheduling your meeting. If you plan to send
people to your WebEx site to have them join your meetings, you might want
to include a special welcome message that lets them know that the meeting
will start very soon — and to sit tight until it does.
Let Me Share This with You
Your parents taught you all about the value of sharing, right? With WebEx,
you can share any document or application on your computer. Whether you
share a word processing document, a Web site, or a proprietary application,
all your attendees can see it just as if they were sitting at your computer. You
can even share applications, your desktop, a Web browser, or Web content.
Figure 7-5:

Meeting

102
Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

Attendees can also view any animation and transition effects on shared
Microsoft PowerPoint slides. Media files (such as movies or audio) embed-
ded in a PowerPoint presentation require conversion, so WebEx enables
you to easily convert such files with something called UCF (Universal
Communications Format). See Chapter 4 to read more about UCF files and
how to create them.
Let the sharing begin!
Sharing a presentation or a document
Okay, so just what kinds of things can you share? Sharable documents and
presentations include
 Documents created by a word processor
 Presentations (for example, those created in PowerPoint)
 Graphics and videos 
As soon as your meeting is underway, you can open a document or presenta-
tion to share it. Here are the steps for sharing a document or presentation:
1. In the Meeting window, click the Share Document button. You can also
choose Share➪Presentation or Document instead.
The Share Presentation or Document dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 7-6.
2. Use the Look in field to locate the folder and file for the presentation
or document, select it, and click the Open button.
Meeting Manager first opens the document or presentation in your con-
tent viewer. Attendees can then view the document or presentation in
their content viewers.
Figure 7-6:

file to share.
103
Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting

3. To display the next page or slide, click the Next button. If you want to
display the previous page or slide, click the Previous button (see
Figure 7-7).
4. If you are sharing Microsoft PowerPoint slides that include animations,
do the following to display different slides and their animations:
• To display the next slide or animation, press the right arrow on
your computer’s keyboard.
• To display the previous slide or animation, press the left arrow on
your computer’s keyboard.
If you open another document or presentation, Meeting Manager adds
another tab to the top of the content viewer. You can display different docu-
ments or presentations by clicking the tabs.
To stop sharing a PowerPoint presentation or other document, click the X in
the presentation or document tab in the content viewer.

Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

You can use various annotation tools that appear on each document panel in
the content viewer to mark up documents or presentations during a meeting.
These are the same annotation tools that appear on the WebEx Whiteboard
view. The use of each of these tools is explained in the upcoming section,
“Working with the whiteboard.”
Sharing an application
Sharing an application gives control of that application to an attendee. An
attendee can request to control an application, and a host can hand over that
control. Sharing a document within the application sharing mode allows meet-
ing attendees to both see the document and annotate it by using the WebEx
annotation tools.
You can also simply share a document without sharing an application. See
the preceding section, “Sharing a presentation or a document,” for more
about that.
This method of sharing can be “quicker to the punch” in a training setting.
While a student is trying a procedure, you can jump in and control an
attendee’s application remotely to show him or her what to do, which can
really save time: Rather than describe a process, you just demonstrate it
while students watch, and then you’re on to other topics.
Sharing an application also enables you to show software that an attendee
doesn’t have or might not understand how to use. For example, if you are a
software manufacturer and you want to demonstrate a proprietary applica-
tion, you can share the application and show it off to potential customers.
Starting application sharing
Here’s how you go about sharing an application:
1. In the Meeting window, choose Share➪Application.
The Share Application dialog box appears showing a list of all applica-
tions currently running on your computer.
Any running applications appear in the Share Application dialog box.
Although you can share applications that are not yet running (by click-
ing New Application), I suggest starting the application before your
meeting begins and then minimizing it. That way, you don’t need to keep
your meeting attendees waiting while you start the software.
2. In the list of applications, select the application that you want to share.
105
Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting

3. Click Share.
The Meeting window minimizes on your computer. If the application is
not already running, it starts automatically.
Your application appears in a sharing window on attendees’ screens.
Taking sharing further
The application-sharing feature of WebEx is very flexible. If necessary, you
can return to the meeting window, causing all attendees to return to the
meeting window as well. You can also
 Share additional applications.
 Make the shared application appear full-screen on attendees’ screens.
 Temporarily pause application sharing at any time to freeze attendees’
views of the shared application.
When you share an application, a small green button labeled Sharing appears
on the application window (see Figure 7-8). Click this button, and a menu
appears with the following choices:
Sharing button

Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

 Select Application: This takes you back to the Share Application dialog
box so you can choose a different or additional application to share.
 Share: This choice switches you to Document Sharing; from this window
you can select a document or presentation to share).
 Allow to Annotate and Allow to Control Remotely: These are com-
mands that a presenter can use to control what attendees can do in the
shared application.
 Start Annotation: This choice displays a set of annotation tools (see
Figure 7-9) that you can use to annotate what’s displayed in the shared
application.
 View: This choice allows you to view the shared application full screen
or reduced in size.
 Pause Sharing and Stop Sharing Application: These are used to freeze
the application or to close it, respectively.
A set of tools called a Floating Icon tray displays when you share an applica-
tion (see Figure 7-10) that includes the following features (from left to right):
 Move tray: Click this and hold down your mouse button to drag the tray
of tools around your screen.
 Return to Main Window: Use this to go back to the meeting environment.
 Participant Panel, Chat Panel, Video Panel, Notes Panel, Polling Panel:
Each of these choices displays a floating version of the appropriate panel.

Stopping application sharing
When you want to stop sharing an application, you can use either of the fol-
lowing series of steps:
1. In the Meeting window, choose Share➪Application.
2. In the list of applications, highlight the application that you no longer
want to share.
3. Click Stop Sharing.
Or
1. Click the Sharing button in the title bar of the application that you are
sharing.
The Sharing menu appears.
2. Click Exit Application Sharing. 
Touring the Web together
Today, it seems like the whole world is on the Web. Sometimes, all you need
to share is a Web site to get your point across. With this type of sharing, you
can display your company Web site, your corporate intranet, or a special
Web site that you built just for the meeting, for example. You do this kind of
sharing in one of two ways: by sharing your Web browser or by sharing Web
content.
When you share your Web browser, you call the shots. Any page or file that
you browse is displayed on attendees’ screens, including HTML pages stored
on your computer or pages in your corporate intranet. You can annotate
these Web pages or let attendees annotate them. Any links that you follow are
displayed on attendees’ screens as well. Note that when you share a Web
browser, attendees might not see all animations or other multimedia content
(such as movies) or hear streaming audio. They also can’t wander off to
other pages or sites unless you take them there.
Comparatively, when you share Web content, you basically take attendees’
browsers to the URL of your choice. Sharing Web content is a good idea if you
want attendees to fully experience a Web site — Flash animations and any
other multimedia content (like the ever-popular Hamster Dance) are fully
available, and attendees can interact independently with the Web site.
You can also grant attendees control of your Web browser by choosing
Share➪Web Browser from within your meeting.
108
Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

Sharing a Web browser
When you share your Web browser, attendees can essentially come along for
the ride as you surf around the Web.
To share your Web browser with others, follow these steps:
1. In the Meeting window, choose Share➪Web Browser.
The Meeting window minimizes on your computer and your default Web
browser opens, as shown in Figure 7-11.
Your Web browser (and any content that it’s displaying) appears in a
sharing window on attendees’ screens.
2. Browse to any Web page or HTML file that you want to display on
your Web browser.
The file then is also displayed to attendees.
When you want to quit sharing your Web browser, do the following:
1. On the title bar of the Web browser that you are currently sharing,
click the Sharing button.
2. On the menu that appears, choose Exit Web Browser Sharing.
Figure 7-11:
Sharing a
Web
browser.
109
Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting

Sharing Web content
Sharing Web content provides some advantages over sharing a Web browser
because users can enjoy the full functionality of a Web page, including anima-
tions. However, sharing content can be a mixed blessing because you can’t
fully control what attendees see; they can act independently on the sites that
you take them to.
The following steps explain how to share Web content:
1. In the Meeting window, choose Share➪Web Content.
The Share Web Contents dialog box appears (see Figure 7-12).
2. In the Address box, specify the Web address (URL) of the content that
you want to display.
You can copy a URL from any source — such as another browser
window — and then paste it in the Address box, if you prefer.

Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 
Special effects for Web browser sharing
While sharing a Web browser in a WebEx meet-
ing, keep the following factors in mind:
 You can return to the Meeting window,
causing all attendees to return to their
Meeting windows, by choosing click the
Return to Main Window icon on the floating
icon tray. 
 Attendees can view any new Web browser
windows that you open. Thus, attendees can
view several Web pages simultaneously.
 You can display your Web browser in a full-
screen view on attendees’ screens.
 You can temporarily pause Web browser
sharing at any time to freeze attendees’
views of the shared Web browser.
Use the tools on the Sharing menu to control
your shared Web browser.

3. Click OK.
The Web page opens on each participant’s screen within the content
viewer.
Participants can navigate to other Web pages within the content viewer in the
Meeting window. Attendees can navigate to other pages by clicking links on
the shared page.
Sharing your desktop
Don’t worry if your desktop is a clutter of paper, pens, and old donuts. I
wouldn’t ask you to invite anybody to browse around that desk. However, you
can share your Windows desktop, and it comes in handy for several uses.
Desktop sharing is great for showing how you switch among applications or
use other operating system features, or for sharing multiple applications
when you don’t want to share them all individually. When you share your
desktop, attendees can see everything on your desktop and everything you
do on your desktop, including any applications that you run. Here’s how to
share your desktop:
1. In the Meeting window, choose Share➪Desktop.
2. Click OK.
The Meeting window minimizes on your computer, and your entire desk-
top appears in a full-screen view on attendees’ screens.
When you want to stop sharing your desktop, follow these steps:
1. On the title bar of any window that is open on your computer’s desk-
top, click the Sharing button.
2. On the menu that appears, choose Exit Desktop Sharing.
If you click the Close and Exit Desktop Sharing icon on the Floating Icon tray,
you stop desktop sharing and return to the meeting window — but you can’t
switch between desktop sharing and the Meeting window as you can with
other types of sharing.
Managing a Meeting
When you are in charge of a WebEx meeting, you have a whole rainbow of fea-
tures to pick from to help you communicate, instruct, inform, and otherwise
connect to the attendees. You can also let attendees take over now and then
111
Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting

by allowing them to annotate information you present on a virtual whiteboard,
or by passing them the WebEx ball and letting them run things for a while.
Using chat
If you’ve used chat features on other Web sites, you know just how this works.
Participants can type in a question and send it to the person running the meet-
ing, a presenter, or to everybody in attendance. The person who receives the
chat comment or question can then type in a reply, and send that reply to the
sender, or others in the meeting.
Figure 7-13 shows a chat in progress. The area where the messages appear
after they’re sent is the chat panel. Enter a message in the area just below the
chat panel, and then choose who should receive your message from the Send
To drop-down list. Click the Send button next to it to send your message,
which then appears in the chat panel.

Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

Taking a poll
Political polls might not be much fun, but polls in a WebEx meeting can
be a great way to learn about your attendees, gauge how well they’re grasp-
ing the information you’re presenting, and keep them involved in the 
meeting.
It’s ideal in the typical meeting to run a poll shortly after the meeting starts,
one around midway, and one near the end, but don’t overdo it: No more than
five polls an hour, please!
Here are the steps involved in running a poll:
1. With a meeting open, if the Polling panel isn’t displayed, display it by
clicking the Panels button and choosing Polling (see Figure 7-14).
2. Select a question type: Short Answer or Multiple Choice.
3. Click the New button.
Your cursor becomes active in the Polling viewer area.
Figure 7-14:
The Polling
panel.
113
Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting

4. Type your poll question and press Enter.
Your cursor moves to the next line. If you chose Multiple Choice, when
you enter a choice and press Enter, it is formatted with a radio button
and labeled alphabetically, as in Figure 7-15. If you chose Short Answer,
a small text box in which attendees can enter an answer appears.
5. Create as many questions as you wish by repeating Steps 2–4.
6. To start the poll, click the Open Poll button.
You will see the posted questions and Polling status information, letting
you know how many people have completed the poll.
7. To end the poll, click the Close Poll button.
The results are shown to you.
8. To share results with others, select the Poll Results check box and
then the Apply button.
The Options button on the Polling panel allows you to display a timer that
alerts people to the amount of time they have left to finish the poll. You can
change the amount of time to allow for the poll in the Options dialog box that
appears when you click the Options button.
Figure 7-15:

Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

Taking notes
The Notes feature is a window in which meeting participants can enter notes
about the meeting and save them. This is a good place to write down ideas
that you want to communicate so they don’t get lost, as shown in Figure 7-16.
To designate a single note taker for the meeting while it’s in progress, choose
Meeting➪Options and change the setting from Allow all participants to take
notes to Single notes taker.
You can select one person to be a note taker and publish notes for everyone
in the meeting, or you can allow participants to each take their own notes
and save them. You cannot have all the participants take notes and have
them visible to everyone in the meeting.
Working with the whiteboard
One of the old standbys of great brainstorming sessions is the low-tech
whiteboard (also know as a blackboard or flipchart). In a WebEx meeting, the
old whiteboard has gone high-tech, with tools for entering and annotating
information. Everybody can grab a virtual pen and start adding their ideas,
thoughts, and scribbles to the mix.
You display the whiteboard by choosing Share➪Whiteboard. Here’s a run-
down of whiteboard features (see Figure 7-17):
Figure 7-16:

115
Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting

 The Pointer tool is used to display an arrow with the user’s name in it.
Move this arrow around the whiteboard to point out something, and
everybody will know who is doing the pointing.
 The Text tool is the one you use to type on the whiteboard. Click the
Text Tool, click anywhere on the whiteboard, and then begin typing.
 The Line and Rectangle tools actually offer more tools than you can
see in Figure 7-17. Click the arrow on either tool, and additional shapes
are displayed. When you choose one of those shapes, the tool name
changes to that shape (for example, Check Mark or Double-Headed
Arrow). Choose one of these tools, and then click and drag on the white-
board to draw the shape.
 The Highlighter tool also changes its name if you click the arrow and
choose the Pencil tool. These two tools are used to emphasize or anno-
tate information or to draw on the whiteboard area.
 The Annotation Color tool displays a color palette for the virtual ink
that is used by the highlighter tool.
 We all make mistakes! That’s why there’s an Eraser tool. You can either
click the arrow on this tool and choose different items to clear; or click
the tool and then with the little eraser cursor that appears, click individ-
ual shapes, annotations, or text to clear items one by one.

The Edit menu has several useful commands for whiteboarders:
 Choose Edit➪Add Page to create a new, blank whiteboard page.
 Choose Edit➪Annotate On and choose either light background or dark
background to change the whiteboard to a whiteboard with a dark 
background.
 Choose Edit➪Clear and choose My Pointers, All Pointers, or All
Annotations to wipe out what’s been done and start again.
 Choose Edit➪Font to display a Font dialog box that allows you to format
the text that you enter on the whiteboard and use different fonts and
font styles.
You can also copy and paste text and objects onto the whiteboard. When you
are sharing a whiteboard, you choose Edit➪Paste as New Page command to
paste the contents of the Windows Clipboard to the current whiteboard.
Passing the ball
The little WebEx globe icon that appears next to one name in the list of par-
ticipants in a WebEx meeting indicates the individual who has the floor: This
is the head honcho, the designated presenter.
As nice as it is to be the star player, there are times when you’ll want to pass
the ball to let somebody else take it to the hoop. Here’s how you do that:
1. Right-click a person’s name in the Participant panel.
2. Choose Participant➪Change Role To➪Presenter.
The little globe icon jumps to the left of that person’s name.
3. When the person wants to hand back the reins to you (or you want to
ask them to hand them back), he can click your name and choose
Participant➪Change Role To➪Presenter.
Using the same Change Role To menu, you can also change a person’s role to
Host (the host has control of various aspects of the meeting, which I outline
in more detail in Chapter 2), Note Taker (the only person allowed to enter
notes), or Close Captionist (someone who can type in commentary and then
display it as a close caption for all participants, which is useful for meetings
using audio where some folks either don’t have speakers or are hearing
impaired).
117
Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting

Ejecting the unruly
The Expel feature of your WebEx meeting is to be used cautiously. It abruptly
and completely disconnects the person from your meeting. If you’re sure
that’s what you want to do — because the person doesn’t belong in your
meeting or is acting inappropriately — go for it. Here’s how:
1. Click the person’s name in the Participant’s panel.
2. Choose Participant➪Expel.
A dialog box appears, confirming that you want to cut this person off.
118
Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 
Keeping attendees’ attention
Just as sports announcers use snappy patter to
keep you planted on your couch and following
the action, you can use these tips to avoid
viewer burnout:
 Start a chat session. Chat isn’t just for the
socially dysfunctional anymore. You can
use it to keep meeting participants involved
in your meeting by conducting ongoing chat
sessions. Chat is a great way to conduct
brainstorming exercises within a meeting or
to voice opinions on key decisions.
 Take a poll. WebEx’s polling feature is a
quick way to take the temperature of a
group of meeting participants on a particu-
lar issue. For example, how many prefer
Coke to Pepsi? You can also use a poll to
quickly find out who is snoozing.
 Share a whiteboard and use annotation. If
you are sharing a document and you’re not
sure people are paying attention, ask
people to point out the part they most like or
dislike and then see who starts scribbling
on the whiteboard.
 Pass the ball. Pass presentation rights (“the
ball”) to the person you suspect of dozing
off. If nothing happens, you’ll have your
answer.
 Throw out some non sequiturs. If partici-
pants seem like they’re not listening, say
something really strange. Nothing gets
people’s attention like, “In order to boost
third quarter profits, we will be asking
employees to contribute a month’s salary.”
 Push an unexpected Web page. With
WebEx’s push feature, you can send out any
Web page you want. I can think of several
that would get people’s attention, and sev-
eral more that could cost you your job. (So
be careful how you use this idea!)
 Run a short mid-meeting contest. At one
place where I worked, we used to add short
trivia contests to the middle of agendas.
Usually, the prize was very small, but the
trivia questions could be pretty good. This
technique woke people up again in the
middle of the meeting. It was a way to take
a break, exercise the mind, and yet quickly
return to the task at hand.
 If all else fails, eject. Remember that you
have the power of the Expel feature. If you
are faced with meeting participants who
are not paying attention, you can always
eject them. After all, they might not even
notice!

3. Click Yes.
Bye-bye, participant!
Wrapping Up
Even if you often spend the last minutes of a meeting checking your watch
and thinking about that candy bar in your desk drawer, you know deep in
your heart that a good wrap-up is important to any meeting.
To get some closure for your meeting, you should do the following things:
 Document what was discussed at the meeting (for example, meeting
minutes).
 Identify action items for participants.
 List documents that need to be exchanged.
 Set a date, time, and initial agenda for the next meeting.
WebEx enables you to wrap up a meeting and perform all these tasks practi-
cally on autopilot. Many WebEx features enable exactly these kinds of wrap-
up activities in ways that are sometimes more efficient than the standard
face-to-face meeting. WebEx can document chat and create a transcript on
the fly, and then you can easily distribute this transcript to all the meeting
participants.
Transferring files
You can transfer files, such as spreadsheets, word processing documents,
drawings, and so on while you meet. I especially like this feature because file
exchange is taken care of on the spot, not put off until after the meeting (“I’ll
e-mail those files to you as soon as I get back to my desk. I promise!”) and
then forgotten.
Starting file transfer
Here’s how to start a file transfer:
1. Choose File➪Transfer.
The File Transfer window appears, as shown in Figure 7-18.
2. Click Share File.
A standard Open File dialog box appears.
119
Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting

3. Select the file that you want to share.
4. Click Open.
The File Transfer window automatically appears in each attendee’s
Meeting window.
The number of attendee Meeting windows in which the File Transfer
window is open, including your own, appears in the lower-right corner of
the File Transfer window.
When you want to stop file transfer, just close the File Transfer window by
clicking the X button as you would to close any other window.
Saving the transferred file
After you transfer a file to meeting participants, each participant must save
the file to his or her hard drive, as follows:
1. From the File Transfer window, select the file to save.
2. Click Save to save the file.
Saving stuff
One of the great things about WebEx is that it constantly keeps track of your
chat and notes during your meetings. All you need to do to have a permanent
record of your meeting is to save a transcript of those communications. The
following sections explain how.
Figure 7-18:

Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

Saving notes
After you have a really full notes window from a productive meeting, you
probably should save them, right? Here’s how:
1. Click the Save button in the Notes area or choose File➪Save in the
Meeting window.
The Save Notes As window appears, as shown in Figure 7-19.
2. Browse to a location where you want to save your notes.
3. Type a name for your notes file in the File Name text box.
4. Click Save.
Meeting Manager saves the file as a text file (.txt). You can open it in
any word processing program.
You can now use the File Transfer feature to distribute the notes to other par-
ticipants, or you can use the Send Transcript feature and include the notes in
an e-mail attachment. To do so, follow the steps in the section, “Transferring
files,” and select the notes file you just saved as the file to transfer.
Saving chat
Chat can sometimes be meaningless chatter, but sometimes it’s the place
where the neatest ideas of your whole meeting surface. In that case, you’d
better save it for posterity. To save a new chat, follow these steps:
1. In the Meeting window, choose File➪Save.
2. In the menu that appears, choose Chat.
The Save Chat As dialog box appears.
3. Choose a location where you want to save the file.
Figure 7-19:

121
Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting

4. Type a name for the file in the File Name text box.
5. Click Save.
Meeting Manager saves the file as a text file (.txt) at the location you
chose. You can open the file in any word processing program.
Saving everything
If you have generated chat, polling results, notes, and so on, you might find it
easier to just save the whole shebang at once. To do so, follow these steps:
1. In the Meeting window, choose File➪Save All.
2. In the dialog box that appears (see Figure 7-20), select the options that
you want to save.
When you choose Save All, a folder name is provided for you, but you
can browse to find or enter a different folder destination. Notes and chat
are saved in .txt format.
3. Accept the suggested folder or choose a location where you want to
save the file.
4. Type a name for the file.
5. Click OK.
Meeting Manager saves everything you specify as a text file (.txt) at
the location you designate. You can open the file in any word processing
program.

Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

Sending a Meeting Transcript
to Participants
Sometimes people get lost in a meeting, or join late and need to be brought
up to speed. One great way to accomplish this is to publish a transcript. A
transcript is an e-mail message that contains the following information:
 Meeting topic
 Meeting number
 Meeting starting and ending times
 The URL for the Meeting Information page on your meeting service
Web site
 The list of all participants
 The meeting agenda
You can also attach any of the following files to the transcript if you saved
them during the meeting:
 Shared documents
 Poll questionnaire
 Poll results
 Chat
 Public notes or closed captions that you took or that the note taker or
closed captionist published during the meeting
If you want to send a meeting transcript to participants, follow these steps:
1. In the Meeting window, choose File➪Send Transcript.
If you have saved any files during the meeting, the Send Transcript
dialog box appears, allowing you to attach the files to the transcript
e-mail message.
If you have not saved any files during the meeting, a transcript e-mail
message opens.
2. If the Send Transcript dialog box appears, select the check box for
each file that you want to attach to the transcript, and then click OK.
The transcript e-mail message opens.
123
Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting

3. Review the e-mail message and make any changes that you want.
4. Send the e-mail message.
You should keep several important things in mind when you send a transcript:
 You have to save notes, polling, and chat in order to include them in
your transcript. 
 The transcript is sent to all participants who provided their e-mail
addresses when joining the meeting, regardless of whether they are still
attending the meeting.
 Participants who receive a transcript e-mail message cannot see the
other participants’ e-mail addresses.
The transcript contains notes only if you are the meeting host, the public
note taker, or the closed-captionist, and you have saved the notes to a file.
The notes that are sent in the transcript are the latest version of notes that
you saved, so if new notes are in the notes window since the last time you
saved them, they will not be included unless you save the notes again.
Recording and Playing Back Meetings
It’s often useful to make a recording of a meeting. You can record everything
that goes on screen including chat, whiteboard annotations, and sound. Such
a recording can act as a self-paced tutorial or let those who couldn’t make the
meeting know what went on. Recording and playing back meetings is simple
to do.
Recording for posterity
If you’ve used any of the common media players such as Windows Media
Player, a lot of the features used to record, pause, and playback your meeting
recording will be a piece of cake for you. If you’ve never used a media player —
well, it’s still a piece of cake.
Note that to capture all audio in your teleconference you need to set up a
phone recording adapter. If you don’t set this up, the only audio the Recorder
captures is through your computer’s microphone, if one is attached.
Follow these steps to record a meeting:
1. Choose Meeting➪Start Recording.
The Save Recorded Meeting As dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-21,
appears.
124
Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

2. Enter a name for your recording in the File Name text box, and click
Save.
The Recorder Panel shown in Figure 7-22 appears.
3. Click the Record button (a bright red circle).
The recording begins. You can now use the Pause, Stop, Insert Marker
(this divides what preceded from what follows as separate segments), or
Annotation buttons to control the recording.
4. When you’re done recording, click the Stop button.
If you want to control your audio settings, choose Meeting➪Recorder
Settings➪Audio Panel. In the dialog box that appears, you can control the
compression scheme and sampling rate. The compression scheme deals
with the method used to handle how the recording is streamed across the
Internet. The sampling rate controls the audio quality: Higher numbers here
give better quality because more tiny bits of sound are recorded, but a high
sampling setting makes for a larger recording file as well.

Chapter 7: Hosting a Meeting

Watching meeting reruns
Playing a recorded file is simplicity itself. Just locate the file on your com-
puter and double-click it. It opens and begins playing, and the WebEx Player
shown in Figure 7-23 appears.
The tools allow you to (from left to right) Open, Play, Pause, Stop, Go to the
Previous Segment, Rewind, Fast Forward, and Go to the Next Segment. The
last tool button on the right toggles you to and from a Full Screen display. You
can also use the two sliders to adjust audio volume and jump to any point in
the playback, respectively.
You can also use the File and Controls menus to initiate these actions. The
Controls menu also offers both a Loop and Mute command to allow you to
keep the recording playing back again and again (looping) or to mute the
audio.
You can play back a recorded meeting on your own desktop, play it back from
within a WebEx meeting by sharing the file or your own desktop, or allow
people to access it on your Web site.
To stop the playback, click the Close button in the top-right corner of the
WebEx Player.
(Finally) Ending the Meeting
No matter how great your meeting was, I know this is the moment you’ve
been waiting for — The End of the Meeting!
To end a meeting, follow these steps:
1. In the Meeting window, choose File➪End Meeting.
A confirmation message appears, in which you verify that you want to
end the meeting, as shown in Figure 7-24.
Figure 7-23:
The tools

126
Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

2. Click Yes.
The Meeting window closes, and you are free!
When you end a meeting as the host, the Meeting window closes for all atten-
dees. If the meeting includes an integrated voice teleconference, the confer-
ence also ends.
If you’re the host and want to leave the meeting but not end it, first choose
Participant➪Change Role To➪>Host to designate a presenter or attendee as
the host. Now you can head off to your next meeting!
If there is any meeting information that you have not yet saved (such as
shared documents, chat, a poll questionnaire, poll results, or notes), Meeting
Manager asks you whether you want to save them before ending the meeting.
If you choose to save a file, Meeting Manager uses the default filename for
the file. So, if you have already saved the file under another name, Meeting
Manager does not overwrite that file. Meeting Manager also automatically
prompts you to send a transcript when you end a meeting.

In This Chapter
 Registering for a meeting

 Chatting up a storm
 Working together on the whiteboard
 Participating in polls
 Saving notes
A
great portion of this book is written from the perspective of somebody
who holds the reins, so to speak. That is, some chapters address you as
the person who will make the choice to purchase a WebEx solution for your
company. Others put you in the role of a meeting host who has to set up and
run a meeting or other online event. One chapter even puts the hat of the site
administrator squarely on your head to show you some of the tasks involved
in administering a WebEx site. But this chapter is a little different.
Here’s where you get the perspective of somebody attending a WebEx meet-
ing. Somebody else is in charge; somebody else is making the decisions. All
you have to do is appreciate how incredibly easy it is to interact with folks as
an attendee in an online meeting.
So sit back and relax: I’ll run this meeting. You just have to show up!
You’re Invited!
You know that you’re invited to a WebEx meeting when you get an e-mail invi-
tation that looks a lot like the one shown in Figure 8-1. When you get such an
invitation, there are a few things you might do to get ready for the meeting
(but you might not have to do anything!). The possibilities are

 Register for the meeting (sometimes this is mandatory, sometimes you
don’t have to register at all).
 Download software (the Meeting Manager or rich media players).
 Add the meeting to your calendar.
I give you the steps for each of these options in this section.
Registering for a meeting
When a host sets up a meeting, he or she may require folks to register for the
meeting. If that’s the case, the e-mail invitation you receive includes a link
you can follow to see a summary of information about the meeting and regis-
ter. Just click this link and you go to the WebEx site, where you see a sum-
mary of meeting information such as the date, time, duration, agenda, and
so on.
At the bottom of this summary is a Register button. Click it and you see a
form resembling the one shown in Figure 8-2.
Figure 8-1:
Your e-mail
invitation to
a meeting.
130
Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

Fill out the form and click the Register button. That’s all you have to do!
In some cases, a host has the ability to approve registration; this means your
registration may or may not be accepted. In either case, you will receive an
e-mail verifying that you are registered or that you have not been accepted to
attend the event.
Getting ready to attend
You can do a couple of things as an attendee to prepare to deal with the tech-
nology involved in an online meeting:
 You can download the Meeting Manager software client ahead of time.
Although this software is downloaded automatically when you join a
meeting, it can take a few minutes. Downloading ahead of time helps you
get to the meeting on time.
 The e-mail invitation you receive may include a link that you use to
verify that you have the versions of rich media players (Flash and
Windows Media Player) that you need to view presentations in online
meetings. Better to get these all installed ahead of time to save you the
embarrassment of missing half the presentation.

Chapter 8: Attending Meetings

Getting Meeting Manager software ahead of the curve
Though WebEx is an online service, you must install one piece of technology
on your computer to interact with it. Meeting Manager is a small software
program that allows you to attend WebEx events. It takes only minutes to
download.
To download the Meeting Manager client, follow these steps:
1. Click the link in your e-mail invitation that takes you to the WebEx
site for more information.
2. Click the New User link on the Navigation bar.
The Setup for New Users page appears (see Figure 8-3).
3. Click the Setup button.
A dialog box appears, telling you to wait while the file is set up.
4. Wait a minute or so. A window appears, telling you that the download
is complete. Click OK.
That’s really all you have to do.
You may also notice Meeting Manager downloads occurring from time to
time even after you’ve installed the software. These are just small automatic
updates WebEx makes to your software.
Figure 8-3:

Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

Downloading rich media players
When the meeting host schedules the meeting, he or she can indicate that
attendees should verify rich media players. If that’s the case, your e-mail invita-
tion contains a link for determining which rich media players you already pos-
sess and whether they are compatible with WebEx’s Universal Communications
Format.
Click the link and you speed over to the page shown in Figure 8-4. Here you
can simply click the Check Now links (there’s one for Flash and one for
Windows Media Player) to verify your software.
When you click one of these links, a window appears and an animation (for
Flash) or video (for Windows Media Player) should play, as shown in Figure 8-5.
If it doesn’t, click the link provided to update your player. If the media files do
play, just click the Close button — your system passed the test.
Depending on your computer, it can take a few moments for these presenta-
tions to play. Use the time to water your desktop plant — it will thank you
for it.

Chapter 8: Attending Meetings

Adding a meeting to your calendar
If a meeting occurs but it’s not on your calendar, is it real? Of course not!
WebEx provides a couple of mechanisms for adding meetings to your calen-
dar program (such as Outlook or Lotus Notes).
The easiest way to do this is one click away: Just click the link provided in
your e-mail invitation to see meeting information (you may be required to
enter a password to complete the link); when you see the meeting informa-
tion, click the Add to My Calendar button to add the meeting to Microsoft
Outlook. When you click this link, you see the dialog box shown in Figure 8-6.
Just select the Open This File with Microsoft Office Outlook option and then
click OK.
The e-mail also includes instructions for adding the meeting to Lotus Notes.
Here’s how you do that:
1. Right-click the iCalendar format (*.ics) file that is attached to the
e-mail invitation and then choose View.
2. Click Import All.
A new broadcast e-mail message is added to your Lotus Notes Inbox.
3. Open the new message.

4. Click the Respond button.
A menu appears.
5. Click Accept.
Joining a Meeting
It’s meeting time! Grab your pad, a pen, your cup of coffee, and dash off to —
nowhere. You can sit tight right at your desk, or lean back on the couch in
your hotel room with your laptop on the coffee table. That’s the beauty of a
WebEx meeting.
After you’re all cozy, read the next few sections to see how you join a meeting.
Follow the links
The e-mail invitation you receive provides a link that you click to get more
information or to join the meeting. Click that link and you go to a page in
WebEx showing you the meeting information.
Click the Join Now button to join the meeting. You may be required to enter
your name, e-mail address, and a password that has been provided to you.
After you’ve entered this information, click the OK button.
Depending on whether you’ve already downloaded Meeting Manager, you may
have to wait a few minutes while WebEx sets you up. After that, Meeting Center,
which looks something like Figure 8-7, appears on your computer screen.

Chapter 8: Attending Meetings

The message that appears on-screen when you’re waiting to join the meeting
says it eloquently, but I’ll repeat it here for you: Do not refresh your browser,
or navigate away by clicking the Back arrow in your browser, or you could get
disconnected. If you are disconnected, you can always join again, but why
bother with the hassle? If you absolutely have to go to your e-mail or some
other site while the meeting is being set up, just open another browser
window so that your meeting will stay intact.
Dialing in
Is this the quietest meeting you’ve ever been to, or what? Well, that’s because
at this point you’re hooked up only to the visual portion — not the audio 
portion — of your meeting. You can connect to the audio portion by making
a phone call or by using Internet Phone with Voice over Internet Protocol
(VoIP) technology.
If your host has set up the meeting to use teleconferencing, the dialog box in
Figure 8-8 appears shortly after you enter the meeting environment. It tells
you what number to call to connect to the meeting, and what meeting
number to enter when you make the call.
The host may have set things up so that you get a call rather than make a call
to join the audio portion of the meeting. If this is the case, you see the Join
Teleconference dialog box shown in Figure 8-9. Just enter your phone number
and, in the blink of an eye (honestly, your phone rings almost immediately —
it’s spooky!), you get called in.
Figure 8-7:

Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

When is the Internet a phone?
VoIP isn’t a new kind of robot kit. VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) is a
technology that enables you to make phone calls over the Internet. VoIP
turns analog voice signals into little digital packets of information that get
sent over the Internet, sort of like sending a file of data. Based on something
called the Internet Protocol (IP), you can hold two-way conversations using
VoIP. And believe me, that’s all the techie stuff you need to know (and more)
to use Internet Phone.
Here is how to get on board with an Internet Phone meeting. Be sure you
have speakers and a microphone hooked up to your computer. Then, join the
meeting. After you join, you should see a pop-up window asking you to partic-
ipate in the Internet Phone conference. At this point you can click the Yes
button. Or, if you wait a minute or so and the pop-up window doesn’t appear,
choose Tools➪Internet Phone➪Join Conference.
Getting Heard
Are you sitting at your desk, connected to a WebEx meeting, but haven’t a
clue how to jump in and participate? No wonder. This is a brand new world.

We’ll call
you; just

Chapter 8: Attending Meetings

There are buttons and panels here you’ve never used. You don’t know which
panels you control and which are controlled by others.
So, in this section, I go over the ways attendees can interact in WebEx
Meeting Center.
You should be aware that what you’re able to do will vary based on what
privileges the host of the meeting has granted to attendees. See Chapter 4 for
a rundown of the various privileges that a host can dole out.
Chatting away
Call it chat. Call it instant messaging. It’s essentially a pretty straightforward
way for participants in an online event to communicate by typing their com-
ments to each other. The comments appear in a chat panel, and you can
scroll up and down to review the conversation.
The Chat panel in Meeting Center, shown in Figure 8-10, is simplicity itself.
Here’s how it works:
1. Enter a message by clicking in the box to the left of the Send button
and typing your words of wisdom.
2. Choose the person to whom you want to send your comment by click-
ing the arrow on the Send To field and choosing your recipient: Host,
Presenter, Host & Presenter, All Participants (which includes host,
presenters, and attendees), or All Attendees (only those who are nei-
ther hosts nor presenters).
Note that your host controls with whom you can communicate when he
or she sets up the meeting, so you might not see all these options.
3. Click Send to send your message.
4. View your message and any replies in the main chat window.
Sharing your thoughts on the whiteboard
You are obviously a creative person. (I just have a sense about these things.)
You love to brainstorm and add your two cents to anything from a snappy
company slogan to a clever product logo. The WebEx whiteboard was meant
for you.
138
Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

WebEx’s whiteboard is much like any whiteboard in a typical conference
room, in which a person can get up in turn, grab the marker (try shaking it if
it’s running dry — they’re always running dry!), and add a word, phrase, or
drawing to the current brainstorming session. But with an online whiteboard,
nobody has to worry about whether the markers are going dry, if you’re run-
ning out of paper, or where the masking tape that you use to stick the darn
things on the wall went to. You just click the annotation tool, choose pencil
or highlighter (see Figure 8-11), and have at it.
The host must grant you annotation privileges, either when setting up the
meeting or during the meeting, or you can’t annotate on the whiteboard.
Sorry!
Being part of a poll
Remember the last time you were in the shopping mall and a guy with a clip-
board and a tie spotted with gravy stains asked you to fill out a poll about
your favorite flavor of frozen yogurt? Well, an online poll is similar, but much
faster and less painful. The presenter designs some questions and posts
them, and you respond. The results from all attendees are compiled quickly,
and the next thing you know, you’re moving on to the next item of business.
Figure 8-10:
Chatting
away!
139
Chapter 8: Attending Meetings

If a presenter in your meeting runs a poll, it’s a piece of cake to participate.
The question, which may be in the form of a multiple choice or short answer
question, appears in the Polling panel. Select your choice or enter your
answer and click the Submit button. The results appear only on the screen
of the person running the poll, and he or she chooses whether to share the
results with everybody.
Changing the view
Once again, depending on what settings the host made when scheduling the
meeting, you may or may not have control over your view. One option the
host may choose is to have you constantly follow whatever it is he or she is
showing you on screen. But another choice gives you free will: You can dis-
play whatever panels and views you wish while the meeting is going on.
Panels are displayed along the right side of the Meeting Center window (see
Figure 8-12).

Part III: Let the Meetings Begin 

Here are the ways you can control panels (assuming you have been granted
control):
 Click the arrow on the Panels button at the top right of the panel area to
choose which panels to display from a drop-down menu.
 Click the Minimize button in the top-right corner of any individual panel
to close it.
 Click the arrow to the left of the panel name; if the panel is expanded, this
is the Collapse Panel button and does just that; if the panel is collapsed,
this is labeled the Expand Panel button and . . . well, you get the idea.
 Place your mouse near the bottom of a panel and the cursor becomes
two lines with arrows pointing up and down. Click and drag to change
the size of the panel.
 If you close a panel, it appears as a button in the Panels title bar. Just
click that button to display the panel.
In addition to panels, you may see some tabs in the Meeting Center. The Info
tab will always be there. Depending on what the presenter has opened, these
may also be tabs labeled Whiteboard or with the name of a document being
presented to all attendees (see Figure 8-13). Click one of these tabs to view its
contents.

Chapter 8: Attending Meetings

Saving Things and Wrapping It Up
After you’ve had your fun and chatted, drawn annotations on the whiteboard,
and generally interacted in a productive way, your meeting will, eventually,
come to an end. When it does, your host has the ability to send a meeting
transcript to everybody. If he or she does, you’ll receive the transcript via
e-mail.
You have some ability to save things from your meeting yourself (again, if the
host has allowed you the privilege of saving). You can save shared docu-
ments, polls, or the contents of chat or closed captioning.
Leaving a meeting and saving it all
Gotta move on to that next meeting? You can leave a meeting at any time by
choosing File➪Leave Meeting. A dialog box appears, asking you to confirm
that you want to leave the meeting. Click Yes. The Save Meeting Files dialog
box shown in Figure 8-14 appears.

Your host will have set various privileges for the meeting, so what you can
save will differ, but the options may include
 Shared Documents
 Poll Questionnaires
 Poll Results
 Chat
 Closed Captions
Select the items you want to save; if you like, you can click the Browse button
and choose another location to save your file to. When you’ve made your
selections, click Yes.
Don’t forget to thank the host!
When you leave a meeting, a feedback form appears (see Figure 8-15) asking
about your meeting experience. It’s a polite gesture to fill in the form to let
the host know what you thought of the meeting. This feedback helps the host
and the host company to discover how to provide more effective online meet-
ing experiences. When you’ve filled out the feedback form, click the Submit
button to send in the form.

R
emember the last time you set up a sales meeting with a customer? You
had to catch a plane from Indianapolis to Detroit (routed through Salt
Lake City), grab a cab to the customer’s office, sign in, get a little plastic
badge with your name misspelled on it, and sit for twenty minutes, only to
have your customer’s assistant come down to the lobby and tell you that her
boss had to rush off that morning to the plant in Des Moines to fix a huge
problem on the production line and that she sends her regrets. . . .
Sales meetings can be the lifeblood of your organization. They can help you
land a new client, close a sale, or keep a current customer happy. But meeting
in person can be costly and time-consuming, and meeting by phone is clumsy
and doesn’t allow you to share the information and documents that help you
make your point. That’s where a Sales Center online sales call comes in. In this
intimate online meeting room, you can sit and chat with your customer, share
applications on your desktop, get personal by showing yourself on video, and
invite sales teams members, subject matter experts and prospects to join in
on the fly. You can display presentations or even browse the Web together to
demonstrate how you compare with the competition.
In this chapter, you discover the unique features of a sales meeting, how to
set one up, and how to generate a sales meeting report when the meeting is
over.

Understanding Roles in Sales Meetings
In WebEx Sales Center, the roles are slightly different than they are in WebEx
Meeting Center. Here’s the rundown on who’s who:
 Host: Just as in Meeting Center, Sales Center meetings have a host who
has a WebEx Sales Center user account. The host is normally the sales
representative or the admin for the sales representative who schedules,
starts, and controls the meeting. The host is also the person who
assigns roles to others. At the outset, the host is the presenter, but the
role of presenter can be handed to any other sales team member during
the course of the meeting.
 Presenter: There’s only one presenter at any given time; this is the
person who holds the meeting floor, so to speak. The presenter shares
and annotates presentations, documents, and the whiteboard. This
person can also share software, and allow participants to take control of
shared software applications. Presenters also can turn meeting options
on and off, run polls, transfer files, and control live video feeds. The
WebEx globe icon appears next to the current presenter’s name in the
Participants window in a sales meeting (see Figure 9-1).
Figure 9-1:

meeting in
progress.

Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

 Sales Team Member: This is a two-pronged type of role. A sales team
member can be a sales manager, sales team colleague or a subject
matter expert. By default, the host and the presenter are Sales team
members. Invited sales team members typically observe the meeting
rather than make presentations, although a subject matter expert may
be called on to chip in his or her two cents. A sales team member may
also take on the task of taking notes.
 Expert: The meeting host can invite an expert to join any meeting in
progress by choosing Participant➪Invite as Expert. The Participants List
will designate anyone invited as an expert, and list his or her area of
expertise. This is a quick way to get somebody “in the know” in the loop.
 Prospect: Ah, the golden prospect, the potential customer. Prospects
can listen, chat, and share a desktop or document. This person can also
share information if the current presenter hands over the reins, and he
or she can also transfer files using the File Transfer feature. Sales Center
provides a simpler, easy to use interface for the prospects that there is
no learning needed to attend and experience the sales calls.
Setting Up and Using Portals
A communications portal is essentially a uniquely branded place on the Web
where your prospects go to access documents, missed sales calls recordings,
videos, or links to documents on the Website related to their account and
even join the next sales call. You can post materials on the portal, and your
prospects can direct others to the portal to view information about your
company, in effect helping to sell your product or service for you. You can
also include information about you, the sales rep and your sales team in the
portal, such as your phone numbers or e-mail addresses.
Each portal is built around a specific account and opportunity. An opportu-
nity is simply a word or phrase you designate that describes what kind of
sales interaction you might have with this account; for example, if you are
introducing a new product line to a large customer the opportunity might be
New Product Line. When you create a portal, you can choose an existing
account or create a new one, and specify an opportunity, either from those
you’ve created in the past (such as a consulting opportunity or product sales
opportunity), or by creating a new opportunity. Figure 9-2 shows a portal for
my company. Notice that you can even personalize the portal with an image
or logo.

Scheduling a Sales Meeting
If you’re like most salespeople, you live to connect with your prospects and
close that sale. Sales meetings in Sales Center provide a great way to hook up
with prospects or existing accounts to share information or presentations. The
process of scheduling a sales meeting is quick and painless, which is lucky for
you because you’re too busy to spend a lot of time scheduling meetings.
The process of scheduling a sales meeting is actually very similar to that
of scheduling a meeting with Meeting Center, which is covered in detail in
Chapter 4. But you’ll be glad to hear that it’s quicker: There are actually a
few steps in scheduling a Meeting Center meeting that you don’t have to go
through for a sales meeting, such as entering registration information and
setting attendee privileges and meeting options. I hit the highlights for Sales
Center here, but if you need a little more step-by-step help, flip to Chapter 4.
Let the scheduling begin!
Start by clicking the Host a Meeting menu on the Sales Center page. As you
can see in the first page that appears, shown in Figure 9-8, there are seven sec-
tions of information you can enter to start a meeting: Required Information,
Date & Time, Teleconference, Invite Attendees, Agenda & Welcome, Emails,
and Review. At a minimum, you have to enter the Required Information. After
you have entered that information, you can go on to the other sections and fill
them in, or click the Start button at any time and begin the meeting.
You can also start scheduling a meeting by clicking the Host a Meeting link on
the WebEx Welcome page.
On the Required Information page, you can use the Select Account and Select
Opportunity links to choose these items from drop-down lists on the pages
that appear. The Select Account page is shown in Figure 9-4. If you haven’t
created any accounts or opportunities by creating portals, you can create
one now within this dialog box. (See the earlier section, “Setting Up and Using
Portals,” for instructions on how to do this.)
After you return to the Required Information page, enter and confirm a meet-
ing password (note that this may or may not be mandatory, depending on
how your site administrator has set things up) and click Next. The Date &
Time page shown in Figure 9-9 appears. Use the various fields to specify the
date, time, duration, e-mail reminders you’d like to send, and recurrence for
the meeting (if any). Click Next.
You can also click the button for each of the sections to go to them in any
sequence you like, rather than clicking Next.
154
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

The Teleconference page shown in Figure 9-10 appears. On this page, you
set up which (if any) teleconference service to use (WebEx’s own or a third
party’s). If you use WebEx’s teleconferencing service, you can also designate
whether attendees should call in or receive a call back; and what sound (if
any) is heard when somebody enters or exits the meeting. Adjust these set-
tings and then click Next.

Chapter 9: Closing More Deals Faster with Sales Center

On the Invite Attendees page shown in Figure 9-11, you can click the Select
Prospects and Select Sales Team buttons, and in the page that appears
(Figure 9-6 shows the Select Prospects page), invite folks to the meeting.
When a dialog box opens, select a name and click the Invite button to invite
that person to the meeting. When you’ve selected all invitees, click OK to
close the dialog box.

When you click Next to move to the Agenda & Welcome page (see Figure 9-12),
you can enter agenda items in the Agenda field and upload a file that will
appear when you start the meeting. You can also control playback by choos-
ing either the Start Automatically or Continuous Play button. Click Next when
you finish.
On the Emails page shown in Figure 9-13, you can leave the default messages
or enter personalized messages for both prospects and your sales team.
Those are all the choices available to you. Now it’s time to make sure you got
things right and get the meeting going. Click Next.
Reviewing your settings and 
starting the meeting
The final page in the sales meeting scheduling sequence is the Review page
(see Figure 9-16). This shows you all the choices you just made (see Fig-
ure 9-14). If you see that something’s amiss, just click one of the numbered
items to the right and go back and make corrections.

When you’re happy with your meeting settings, you have three options:
 If you have not specified a date and time, click the Start button to start
the meeting immediately.
 If you specified a date and time for the meeting, click the Schedule button.
A page appears giving you the option of starting the meeting immediately.
If you’re not ready to start right now, that’s fine; when you are ready to
meet, just go to the Sales Center area of WebEx, locate the meeting on the
Attend a Meeting menu, and click the meeting link. When the meeting
overview shown in Figure 9-14 appears, click the Start Now button.
 Click the link in the confirmation e-mail. WebEx sends you to the page
shown in Figure 9-14. Click the Start Now button.
Though there’s no Instant Meeting option on the Sales Center page, you can
set up an Instant Meeting for Sales Center by following these steps:
1. Go to My WebEx.
2. Select My WebEx Meetings.
3. Click the One-Click Meeting tab.
4. Under Service Type, select Sales Center Sales Session to set up a Sales
Center meeting.
Seeing and Monitoring Sales Meetings
from Different Perspectives
If you’re the sales manager, you can make use of a unique feature that allows
you to observe your sales reps in action with accounts. Because nobody will
know you’re attending, this is called silent monitoring. Using this feature helps
you to coach your sales reps. This ability is usually restricted to managers by
your site administrator.
Another handy feature allows a meeting host to see your meeting from your
prospect’s perspective. Being able to see the meeting from the participant’s
perspective helps you get another look at your own presentation so that you
can fine-tune it. During a meeting, the host opens another browser window
and goes to My Meeting on his or her WebEx site. Click the Prospect View link
there, and you’ll join the meeting, seeing what the participants see.
159
Chapter 9: Closing More Deals Faster with Sales Center

Finally, there’s another monitoring feature called the Participant Attention
indicator. This icon tells you a couple of things about the prospect’s desktop
that allows you to know whether he or she is paying attention or playing
Minesweeper: The indicator appears next to a name in the Participant’s panel
if that participant has either minimized the meeting client window or opened
another window on top of the meeting client window.
If your prospect joined the meeting as a group huddled around a single PC
and they entered the name of each person in the group, you’ll only see a
group icon in the Participants List (see Figure 9-15). Click the group icon to
see a list of all the folks attending.
What do you do if you find your meeting looks dull from the participant’s per-
spective, or if she keeps opening other windows on her desktop? Time to
spice things up. Ask some interesting questions in chat, or have the current
presenter ask the prospect to share a document or application with others in
the meeting.
Another great way to know how your prospects experience your meeting is
to encourage them to fill out the feedback form that appears automatically
when the meeting ends.

Using the Sales Meeting Report
The Sales Meeting Report provides usage information about Sales Center
meetings for a specified time period. If you’re the manager of a group of sales-
people, you can use this report to keep track of your group’s communica-
tions with customers and prospects. If you are a salesperson with lots of
accounts to juggle, review your own sales meeting activity to spot accounts
or prospects that haven’t had a meeting in a while so you can set one up.
To generate a Sales Meeting Report, follow these steps:
1. Go to the My WebEx page and click My Reports.
2. Click the Sales Center Reports link.
3. On the Sales Center Reports page that appears, click the Sales Meeting
Report link.
The Sales Meeting Report page shown in Figure 9-16 appears.
4. Select dates from the drop-down lists in the From and To fields to
specify the starting and ending dates of the range you want the report
to cover.
Figure 9-16:
Specify the
range of
dates the

161
Chapter 9: Closing More Deals Faster with Sales Center

5. If you want to see information for every meeting, leave the All Meetings
radio button selected; if you want to see reports for only certain
accounts, click the Select Accounts radio button and then select any
accounts you want to include from the list that appears (hold down the
Ctrl key to select more than one account).
6. Choose an option in the Sort Results By drop-down list.
7. Click the Display Report button.
The report appears, looking a lot like the example shown in Figure 9-17.
The report shows activity on all accounts you selected in Step 5. If you want
more detail about a particular item, click the link in the Topic column for that
session and it is displayed (see Figure 9-18), including the start and end time
of the meeting, and the prospects and sales team members who attended.
Note that you can click the Export Report button in this detailed report to
save it in Excel’s comma-separated-value format.
Sales Managers can also generate reports that provide an overview of the
sales meetings hosted by those who report to them. Choose the Sales
Manager Report from the My Reports area to generate this report.
Want to quickly review all administrative activity on a WebEx account? Click
the Manage Portals link in the Portals menu in Sales Center, select the check
box for an account, and then click the Run Report link. You’ll see a record
of all kinds of activities, from creating a portal to adding documents. (See
Figure 9-19.)

Managing Presentations with
Presentation STUDIO™
Being able to run sales sessions is one thing, but bringing dynamic presenta-
tion content to each session is another. Presentation STUDIO is an add-on
product you can purchase from WebEx that allows you to play, manage, and
Figure 9-19:
The Portal
Report.
Figure 9-18:
Details

particular
sales
meeting.
163
Chapter 9: Closing More Deals Faster with Sales Center

deliver dynamic presentations. These presentations can include PowerPoint
slides, narration, video, Web pages, surveys, and quizzes.
Many WebEx customers rave about Presentation STUDIO, so it’s worth a
quick overview here. If it intrigues you, talk to your WebEx account manager
about purchasing it.
You must have purchased Presentation STUDIO for your WebEx account to
use it, and you must log in to use the STUDIO. Your site administrator will
designate which areas of the site each person can visit and use, so features
available to you may differ. 
Managing presentations by category
With Presentation STUDIO you get an easy-to-use interface (see Figure 9-20)
where all your presentations are listed by category. Use the Search feature on
this page to enter a keyword to find your presentation, or simply click on a
category to display a list of presentations within it. This list shows you infor-
mation about presentations, such as the duration and date created, and to
playback presentations on demand (see Figure 9-21).
You can also click the Presentations All link shown in Figure 9-20 to display
all presentations for your account rather than presentation categories.

tions tab of

tion STUDIO

tions you

164
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

When you click on the More Options link for any presentation in the list
shown in Figure 9-21, you get tools to manage playback settings and to down-
load the file to your computer or PocketPC. 
Playing back presentations
In the More Options window for any presentation, you can click the Audio/
Slides Playback or Slides Only Playback icons and use the media player that
appears (see Figure 9-22) to review your presentation. You can click the Change
the Player Setting button (it looks like a little bulleted list) to set which media
player you want to use from those you have installed on your computer.
Use the Search tab in the media player to look for a particular slide, and the
Notes tab to enter notes about the presentation.

In This Chapter
 Understanding the possibilities of WebEx Support Center
 Starting a support session
 Joining a session
 Assisting in a session
 Exploring session options
You used an online support service yourself when you contacted that
major software manufacturer last year to find out why the four-hundred-
dollar piece of software you just installed crashed your computer. Little did
you suspect that someday you might have to create your own means of
online support for your customers.
WebEx’s Support Center is a like a virtual cubicle that you and your supportee
(whether a customer or an employee) can slide into to chat about problems,
walk through a process on a shared application or desktop, and generally dis-
cover solutions.
In this chapter, I explore the time- and money-saving possibilities of support-
ing your customers or employees online.
Understanding How Support
Center Works
If you’re in a technical business that provides computer or software solutions
to customers, you might find that WebEx’s Support Center is an off-the-shelf
solution that works right from the get-go. It’s economical and easy to use —
and best of all, you don’t have to install or maintain a thing.

It’s tech support . . .
Support Center provides a virtual meeting place where you can provide one-
on-one support. The ideal application of Support Center is troubleshooting
technical problems that occur within a software application, operating
system, or network environment. In this scenario, your support staff can
 Take a look at what is going on with the customer’s or employee’s
system by sharing the application or desktop.
 Use the System Info feature to see key system information instantly. 
 Transfer necessary patches and log files to and from a customer’s or an
employee’s computer.
 Take remote control of your user’s system or give him control of yours.
Here’s a technical word to the wise: WebEx’s Support Center is easy to imple-
ment because it works through virtually all firewalls. It’s secure, but you
don’t run into barriers every time you try to connect to your customers.
. . . but it’s more than tech support
What if you sell grapefruit online instead of computer software? Maybe you
simply want an environment where you can meet with your Web site’s cus-
tomers to discuss issues related to your products or services. You might also
consider Support Center as a place to go to share files, chat, demonstrate
processes or procedures), or transfer documents.
Support Center can be a useful tool for your business because it

A word about SMARTtech
SMARTtech is a Web-based technology that
enables you to create a remote-access and
remote-management network of computers. If
you’re in the IT department, using SMARTtech
allows you to resolve support issues without
ever stepping foot out of the information tech-
nology (IT) department. (This should appeal to
shy IT types.)
With SMARTtech, you can securely access any
systems on your network from a Web browser,
even if you’re on the road to Morocco. You can
also work with other experts to resolve prob-
lems live online. If your company gets set up
with a WebEx site, have your site administrator
check out all the advantages of SMARTtech
with your WebEx account manager.

 Provides instant support sessions to solve trouble on the spot.
 Allows support staff to add a face and a voice to the interaction with
video and chat.
 Gives you a place to share documentation or demos.
 Offers access from virtually anyplace in the world that has a Web 
connection.
Starting Up: Getting a Support
Session Going
Starting a support session is about as easy as falling off a log (and a lot less
painful). Simply go to your WebEx site; on the Welcome page, click the Start
Session link under Support Center. (You can also go to the Support Center
page and click the Start link located there; see Figure 10-1.)
You can also set up One Click Meeting so that you can start sessions from
your desktop, browser, or even Microsoft Office applications. See Chapter 6
for more about how to do this.

The choices

Join a

page.
169
Chapter 10: Delivering Virtual Support with Support Center

When you start a session, WebEx takes a few moments to prepare the session
and download or update Support Manager. Then you see your support window
page, looking just like the one shown in Figure 10-2 (except that you don’t have
any customer in the session — yet!).
When you start a session, you can do darn little until a customer joins. So, it’s
time to get somebody into your session. You can invite people to your ses-
sion by following these steps:
1. Click the Send E-mail Invitation button.
The Invite Users dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-3, appears.
2. Select one of the two radio buttons to indicate whether the invitee is a
Customer or a Support Representative.
3. Enter the invitee’s e-mail address and name and then click OK.
The invitation is on its way.
Your customer can also go to your WebEx site and click the Join button on
the Support Center or Welcome page to join the session.
If for some reason you don’t want to invite people over the Internet, you can
always invite them over sneakernet. Simply note the Support Session Number
of your session, walk over to the person whom you want to invite (or phone
her up), let her know about the session, and give her the Support Session
Number.
Now just sit tight until your customer joins in.

Jumping on the Support Bandwagon
Anybody with access to a WebEx site that includes the Support Center fea-
ture can start a support session and have others join. The person who starts
a session is called the support technician.
Whoever started the thing, if somebody else starts the session and you want
to get in on it, you can do so by joining or by assisting in a session.
Joining a session
When you’re invited to a support session, you can get into the session in a
couple of ways:
 If you receive an e-mail invitation, just click the link in the e-mail.
 If you’re invited in some other fashion (by phone, or on-the-fly in the
hallway, for example), you can join through your WebEx site. Go to the
Welcome page and click the Join link for Support Center or go to the
Support Center page and click the Join link there.
Either of these methods takes you to the Pre-Session form, as shown in Fig-
ure 10-4. If you didn’t follow an e-mail link, you must enter the Support Session
Number, which you have to get from the person who is running the session.
Enter your first name, last name, e-mail address, and company name, and then
click Submit.
After you click Submit, the screen shown in Figure 10-5 appears. Here you can
either click the Chat button to initiate a chat or click the Leave Session button
to exit (but hey, you just got here!). Note the Video button, which you can read
about more about in the later section, “Using video.”

Users dialog
box. 
171
Chapter 10: Delivering Virtual Support with Support Center

Assisting the support effort
Sometimes you want somebody who isn’t a customer or a support represen-
tative to join a support. For example, wouldn’t it be nice to have an engineer
join in a support session to review the problem the customer is having with
the latest and greatest version of your product? That involves joining through

this is what

the Assist Session link. When you join a support session in an assisting
capacity, you see the same tools and options the session initiator sees (see
Figure 10-2). The person running the session can turn over control of the ses-
sion to you by clicking the Transfer Session button on the Session tab.
To join a support session in an assisting capacity, follow these steps:
1. From the Support Center page, click the Assist Session link in the
Provide Support menu.
The Assist Support Session in Progress page, as shown in Figure 10-6,
appears.
2. Enter the Support Session Number and then click Join.
Getting Supportive
It’s time to sit down in a support session and see just what goes on. In a nut-
shell, here’s what you can do:
 Share a desktop or applications, or transfer files.
 Take a look at your customer’s system information; log in to, or reboot
the customer’s computer.
 Chat in an instant messaging format.

Chapter 10: Delivering Virtual Support with Support Center

 Share a video feed with your customer.
 Record your support session.
Whether you’re supporting a network or software application user or per-
haps answering questions about a new procedure or product, you’ll find that
the tools offered in a support session are easy to use and effective.
Many of the features covered as an overview here are the same as those used
in the Meeting Center although they are accessed in the support session envi-
ronment. For more information about sharing and using other tools in an
online WebEx environment, see Chapter 7.
Taking control
How often have you called a technical support person about a problem with
your computer, only to spend many minutes explaining what you’re seeing
on your screen and trying to enact commands that this faceless phone voice
provides? Wouldn’t the easiest thing be to just let the person take control of
your computer and do the troubleshooting firsthand? Of course it would.
In this section, I tell you the simple steps to gaining or giving such control.
Taking control of someone’s desktop
Here are the two ways that you can share a desktop: View somebody’s desk-
top (or let them view yours), or take control of somebody’s desktop (or let
them control yours).
When you control somebody’s desktop, you can
 Work in the desktop as if you were sitting right in front of their computer.
 Annotate on the desktop by using a highlighter tool.
 Troubleshoot software problems without ever having to stir from your
comfy chair.
To view or control a customer’s desktop, in the support session window, per-
form the following steps:
1. Click the Desktop tab to display it (see Figure 10-7).
2. Click Request View to view the customer’s desktop, or click Request
Control to view and control the customer’s desktop.
No matter which button you click, a dialog box will tell the customer
either that the support rep (you) would like to view her desktop or that
174
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

you would like to control her desktop (see Figure 10-8). In either case,
the customer simply either clicks OK to allow the sharing or clicks
Cancel to deny the request.
3. The customer should click OK to accept.
The shared desktop appears. A little green button labeled Sharing
appears in the upper-right corner (see Figure 10-9).
To end sharing, click the Stop Sharing icon from the floating icon tray.

window.
175
Chapter 10: Delivering Virtual Support with Support Center

To switch control back and forth between you and the customer, just click
the desktop, and control is given to the other person.
If your customer is a bit shy about giving you control of his desktop, you can
request to view-only and use annotation tools to guide the customer through
fixing the problem.
Sharing applications
Sharing applications is very handy for helping people understand how to use
software features or supporting customers who are not comfortable sharing
their entire desktops. You might also share an application to run a demo of a
procedure or product to help a support-needy customer understand the fea-
tures better.
Sharing applications is simple and very similar to the process for sharing a
desktop. To share an application, follow these steps:

1. Click the Application tab to display it (see Figure 10-10).
2. Click Request View to view the customer’s application, or click Share
View to provide a view of an application on your computer for the
customer.
No matter which button you click, a dialog box appears to the customer
that says you would like to view his application or that you would like to
show him an application of yours (see Figure 10-11).
3. The customer should click OK to accept.
The Application View or Application Control dialog box appears,
depending on the button that you choose in Step 2.
4. Choose an application from the Share a Currently Running Application
list and then click the Share button.

177
Chapter 10: Delivering Virtual Support with Support Center

If you want to share an application that’s not currently running, click the
New Application button in the Application View or the Application
Control dialog box.
When sharing an application, you have access to a Sharing menu and WebEx
tools, just as you do when sharing a desktop. Use these to annotate, change
the view to full screen, change the color mode to higher resolution, or stop
sharing.
Taking control of a customer’s computer
Sometimes you need to delve deeper into a customer’s computer system to
troubleshoot a problem. Luckily, the support session window has a Customer
Information section with three little tools, as shown in Figure 10-12. The little
buttons in this section come in mighty handy. Here’s what they do:
 The System Information tool on the far left displays information about
the customer’s computer system (see Figure 10-13), including hardware,
installed software, browser, and running software.
 The Log On as a Different User button allows you to log on to the cus-
tomer’s system as a different user. For example, a network administrator
might log on with her own account information to be able to use certain
access rights to make a change to the customers system.
Figure 10-12:
The session
window

Information.
178
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

 The Reboot Computer button does just what it says: It requests that the
customer give you permission to reboot his or her computer. This action
might be required to put new settings on the customer’s system into
effect, for example.
The Log On as a Different User and Reboot Computer buttons both present a
dialog box to the customer, requesting permission for the action. The cus-
tomer clicks OK, and the action is allowed.
You can also access network and mapped drives on yours and customer’s
computer if you need network information to solve a problem.
Transferring files
Error code #154-J? Ah . . . one of my favorites. I just happen to have a white
paper on that error you should read. . . .
When it’s time to share a file or document with a customer to show the steps
necessary to meet a support need, just transfer the file to him while in a sup-
port session so he can be empowered to fix it himself in case the same prob-
lem happens again. Here’s how:
1. On the Tools area of the session window, click the Transfer Files button.
A dialog box appears, allowing you to choose between File Transfer
Advanced and File Transfer Basic. File Transfer Advanced gives you a
full view of all the file directories on your and customer’s computer. File
Transfer Basic allows you to select the files to transfer, keeping your file
Figure 10-13:
Your
customer’s
computer
system
information.
179
Chapter 10: Delivering Virtual Support with Support Center

directories to yourself. You can also deliver files directly to a specific file
directory or folder on your customer’s computer, which is a really secure
way to transfer files.
2. Leaving the default Advanced setting, click OK to proceed.
An Allow File Transfers dialog box appears on the customer’s screen.
3. The customer should click OK to allow the transfer to proceed.
The WebEx File Transfer window, as shown in Figure 10-14, appears.
4. If you are set up with advanced options, you can now go to the folder
on the Remote Computer where you want to upload the file by click-
ing the Up One Level button or by double-clicking folders to open
them.
5. Select the file that you want to transfer from in the Local Computer
area and then click the right-pointing arrow to upload a copy of the
file to the location on the remote computer that you select in Step 4.
6. To get a file from the remote computer and send it to your local com-
puter, select the file from the Remote Computer area and click the
left-pointing arrow.
When you finish transferring files, click the Close button in the top-right
corner of the window.
Note the Create New Folder button for both the local and remote computer,
which you can use to place files in a folder that you create just for your files.
You can also delete folders, delete files, and rename files.
Figure 10-14:
Choosing
files to
transfer.
180
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

You can also access network and mapped drives on your computer and the
customer’s computer.
Chatting
Chatting in a support session works just like chatting in any online meeting.
(See Chapter 7 for more about chatting.) Both you and your customer have
a chat button on your session page. When you or your customer clicks the
Chat button, the floating Chat window appears (see Figure 10-15). Enter a
comment and then click Send, and the window appears in the Chat window.
The customer can then enter a comment, click Send, and so on, allowing you
to happily chat back and forth.
Chat in a support session can also be invoked from a shared application or
shared desktop environment, so you can compare notes on what you’re both
looking at or make suggestions or provide information to each other. Use the
Chat tool in the Floating Icon tray to do this.
To quickly save a chat, click the Save icon (it looks like a little computer disk)
in the upper-left corner of the Chat window.
Getting personal with video
Nothing gets you up close and personal with a customer in need like a smile
and a nod of encouragement. But how do you do that online? One word: video.
With a simple Webcam setup, you can help your customer place a face with
your words of support. Session Manager software automatically detects any
Webcam connected to a participant’s computer.
Note that the customer doesn’t have to have a Webcam set up to watch you
on video. Also, consider using video to show more than just yourself: Show
products, procedures, or whatever you want!
Figure 10-15:
The support
session chat
window.
181
Chapter 10: Delivering Virtual Support with Support Center

Both you and your customer have a Video button on your session window
page (although, at first, your customer’s is inaccessible). You initiate the
video process by clicking your Video button, and two things happen: The
Video window (see Figure 10-16) appears, and the Video button on your cus-
tomer’s window becomes available. In this way, you can share video of each
other as long as you each have some sort of Webcam set up at your desks.
If you want the focus to be on your own talking head, click the Full Screen
tool right under the video display. Click the View Session Window button to
return to the floating window view.
Recording your session
A great support session can form the basis for training or helping other users
or can simply be a useful archive in a frequently asked-questions (FAQ) library.
Figure 10-16:

182
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 
Fine-tuning video
In the video window, you can find an Options
button. Click it, and a dialog box offering several
options appears. You can increase the video
frame rate, which makes it feed faster but can
degrade the quality. The Video Resolution set-
ting allows for low, medium, and high resolution.
This setting can also have an impact on how
smoothly the video appears to the viewer. An
Advanced Options button opens a dialog box in
which you can more finely control settings for
your specific camera, such as brightness. 

Recording a support session records all on-screen activity — such as video,
shared applications or desktops, or chat — and is simplicity itself. The site
administrator has to set up auto recording as an option for support sessions,
so if the feature isn’t working, give this guy or gal a jingle or ping.
If you want to capture audio, alas, it’s not quite so simple. You have to attach
a phone-recording adapter to your computer and phone. No network-based
recording is available for Support Center.
Follow these steps to record a session:
1. From the Tools tab on the session window, click Record Session.
2. An Allow Record message appears to the customer, asking for permis-
sion to record the session. Have the customer click OK.
The Save Record dialog box appears.
3. Enter a filename for the session and click Save.
The Recorder Panel shown in Figure 10-17 appears. Use the tools here to
begin, stop, or pause the recording.
If the Recorder Panel disappears from view as your session proceeds, go
back to the Session tab of the session window and click the Stop Record
Session button to end recording.
Playing back a recorded session
To play back a recorded session, locate it with Windows Explorer and double-
click it. The WebEx Recorder opens and begins playing the session back on
your screen.

It’s Been Swell . . .
Even the most productive support session must come to an end — hopefully,
happily with a problem resolution. To end a session at any time, click the End
Session button on the Tools tab of your session window. Your customer can
also leave a session that’s still in progress by clicking the Leave Session
button on the customer’s session page. When you end a session or a cus-
tomer leaves a session and if your site administrator has set up the feedback
feature, the feedback form shown in Figure 10-18 appears. Try to encourage
your customers to fill out the feedback form to help you improve your sup-
port services in the future.

O
nline training is available in many forms on the Internet. From full-blown,
interactive university courses to simple bullet-point presentations
viewed at a student’s leisure, the Internet allows individuals and organizations
to cut training costs anddeliver a rich and engaging classroom experience over
a Web browser.
With WebEx, training isn’t simply another kind of online meeting. With WebEx
Training Center and presentation applications such as Microsoft PowerPoint
(see Chapter 6 for some tips on making great online presentations), you can
design presentations, course materials, and tests as well as create a rich inter-
active environment for student learning. You can even record training sessions
so that others can access the content in the future. Finally, you’ll find it useful
to generate reports that tell you how effective your training efforts are.
And the best part of it all: You can deliver this training to your own employees,
customers at home or abroad, or salespeople on the road. WebEx offers a
secure and reliable online classroom that these folks can access from virtually
anywhere. In this chapter, you discover the ins and outs of online training.

Getting Set Up for Training
Ever have one of those anxiety dreams in which you walk into a classroom full
of people and begin teaching the class (perhaps naked) without a smidgen of
preparation? Scary, huh?
It’s the same in a virtual classroom: Preparation is key (although, oddly, you
could attend naked if turn off your QuickCam). Before you run a training ses-
sion using WebEx, you need to take care of one technical task, which is to
download the Training Manager (a small client program that takes only a
minute or two to download). In addition, you should tend to the task of prepar-
ing class materials and tests, just as you would for a physical classroom.
Downloading Training Manager
If you’ve used WebEx’s Meeting Center to run or attend a meeting, you have
already downloaded the software client called Meeting Manager. (It’s down-
loaded automatically for you the first time you host or attend a meeting, as
you can read about in Chapter 3.) Training Manager is a similar piece of soft-
ware. These two client programs both enable your computer to connect to
WebEx meetings or training sessions.
Training Manager is a small program and takes only moments to download by
following these steps:
1. Log in to your WebEx site and click the Training Center tab. If you
don’t have the Enterprise Edition, log in to your Training Center site.
2. Click the arrow to the left of the Set Up menu and then click the
Training Manager link.
The screen in Figure 11-1 appears.
3. Click the Set Up button.
A progress screen appears, followed by the screen shown in Figure 11-2
telling you that Training Manager has been installed.
Training Manager also automatically downloads when you first start or attend
a training session. Also, even if you’ve preinstalled it (not a bad idea — you
can get to your training without the delay), when you enter a session, a quick
update installation might occur.
186
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

Designing online training for success
WebEx provides a great interactive virtual classroom with all sorts of valu-
able tools for delivering information and working with students. However, a
classroom won’t do you a heck of a lot of good if you don’t have anything to
say. Creating course materials and tests prior to walking into the WebEx vir-
tual classroom is your first step.

Chapter 11: Creating Virtual Classrooms with Training Center

Does every training session require that you prepare course materials ahead
of time? No. If you are a self-assured presenter, you can use Training Center
to present a live video feed of yourself giving a lecture without prepackaged
slides or other materials. You can also use Training Center to have an interac-
tive brainstorming or discussion session with students via the whiteboard
and Chat features. But for most sessions, you need to prepare audio, video,
or slides, and you should get them done well ahead of time.
Creating course materials
A WebEx training session might consist of one or more live presenters, inter-
active chats, software demonstrations, delivery of student polls or tests, and
presentation of course materials.
What form might course materials take? Well, as with offline classes, it varies.
For example, you can use any and all of these items as course materials:
 Prerecorded video files
 PowerPoint slide presentations, including transitions, animations,
sounds and narration, if you like
 Documents you can share, such as Excel worksheets or PDF brochures
 Graphics, such as an Excel chart or a CAD drawing
 Web content you can share by using the Sharing a Web Browser feature
of WebEx
 Prerecorded events, such as a previously delivered live training lecture
You can also make hands-on labs available, in which you set up students with
remote computers so that they can practice a software application or view
self-paced tutorials on their own. See the section, “Reserving a hands-on lab,”
later in this chapter.
To prepare these materials, you first have to create them in whatever applica-
tion you choose. For video, for example, you can set up a Webcam and use
programs such as Adobe Premiere to record and edit your video. PowerPoint
is the program of choice for bullet-point presentations and works seamlessly
within a WebEx online session.
After you create these files, you should upload them to the My Files section
of My WebEx. Follow these steps to do so:
1. Log in to your WebEx site or Training Center and display the My
WebEx tab.
2. Click the My Files menu.
The page shown in Figure 11-3 appears.
188
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

3. To create a new folder, click the Create Folder icon (located in the
Root Folder Actions column and shaped like a little manila folder),
enter a folder name, and click OK in the dialog box that appears.
4. To add a file to the Root or other folder, click the Upload Files icon in
the Action column for that folder.
The Upload File dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-4, appears.
5. Click one of the Browse buttons; the Choose File dialog box appears.
Locate the file you wish to upload and click Open.
6. Repeat Step 5 for up to three files. When you’re done, click the
Upload button in the Upload File dialog box.
7. Click the Close button to close the My WebEx Files page when you’re
done.
With the files you want to use uploaded, you can now use them as course
materials when scheduling a training session. Links to those materials then
appear on the Session Information page where students can go to download
them before the session begins.
Chapter 6 gives you the lowdown on creating great presentation materials.

Creating tests
If you’re like me, there is no doubt a special place in your heart for tests. In
school, you lived in fear of them for days beforehand, sweated as you tried
to understand what the heck x and y had to do with the circumference of a
swimming pool, and anxiously awaited your scores.
If you’ve ever been on the other side of the fence, as you are when you pro-
vide training using WebEx, you know that tests are simply one way to make
sure that students are keeping up with the information that you provide.
Tests help you gauge how effective your training is, pointing out where you
might need to provide more coverage of a particular concept or skill.
You can deliver a test within a training session, or you can arrange for students
to take a test outside of a training session. All tests that you create are saved in
your Test Library, available on your WebEx site (if you have Enterprise Edition)
or Training Center site.
To create a test, follow these steps:
1. From the Training Center tab of Meeting Center, click the Test Library
link under the Host a Session menu.
The Test Library page, as shown in Figure 11-5, appears.

Polls can provide another tool for judging how students are following the
course. Generally, you use polls to gather attendee opinions or facts about
them, such as previous training in the topic at hand. Tests are used to test
understanding of information that you provide. Chapter 7 covers taking a poll
in more detail.
Hosting a Training Session
At this point in the training planning process, you have all your course mate-
rials created and saved to your My WebEx Files; you’ve designed and saved
tests to determine how learners are progressing; you might have created
some notes for yourself for a live video presentation and perhaps even have
lined up some guest presenters. What’s next? The next step is to schedule the
training and invite attendees.
WebEx has devised a form in which you personalize all the settings and enter
all the information about your training session, including the when, where,
and who. In this section, I go through that form so you know what’s needed.
To access the form, from the Training Center tab of Meeting Center, open the
Host a Session menu by clicking the arrow to the right of it. Then click the
Schedule Training link. The form in Figure 11-12 appears, ready for you to
begin entering information.
Figure 11-12:

195
Chapter 11: Creating Virtual Classrooms with Training Center

Scheduling the training session
The first three sections of this form deal with details such as the session title
and password, teleconferencing options, and the date and time for the train-
ing. Here’s what you enter:
 Session and Access Information: Choose a session type from the drop-
down list and enter a topic for your training. (Your site administrator
has the option of creating session types for your organization. These are
predefined sets of features and options available for sessions. For exam-
ple, a site administrator might create a session type that doesn’t include
video as an option. If you create that session type when scheduling a
session, video will not be available. Setting a session password is
required, so enter one and then confirm it by entering it again. Select a
radio button to choose whether your meeting will be private, listed in
your calendar of meetings on your WebEx site or unlisted. An unlisted
session requires that attendees provide a session number to attend; you
have to communicate the training session number to them, and they
have to type it into a login form to join a session.
 Teleconference: Select one of these choices depending on whether
you want to use WebEx’s teleconferencing service, another service, or
Internet Phone. Note that the None option can be used if you prefer that
attendees merely view a presentation online rather than call into it. Also,
note that the Internet Phone option requires attendees to have head-
phones or speakers connected to their computers. If they want to speak
as well as listen, they also need a microphone.
 Date and Time: Enter information about the date, time, time zone, and
duration of your training. If this course requires multiple sessions, select
the Recurring Session or Multiple Session choice under Occurrence, and
an additional section for setting multiple sessions appears, as shown in
Figure 11-13.
Reserving a hands-on lab
A hands-on lab is essentially a remote computer set up with preloaded docu-
ments or tutorials for students to access. When you’re setting up a training
session, you can also set up students’ access to a hands-on lab. Hands-on
labs first have to be created by somebody with hands-on lab privileges before
you can make them available to users when scheduling a session.
To schedule a lab, simply select the Reserve Computers check box, choose
the lab from the adjacent drop-down list, and enter a number in the Number of
Computers box. If you click the Check Availability button, you are told what
hours are available for the day on which you’re scheduling your session.
196
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

When you click either the Schedule or Start Session buttons at the bottom of
the scheduling form, your computers are reserved.
You can use hands-on labs outside of a training session. Use the Hands-On
Lab link in the Host a Session menu of Training Center to do so.
Customizing the registration form
In the next section of the form, you can choose whether people are required
to register for the class. I highly recommend that you register people for
training, for several reasons:
 Registering people makes them feel they have a more sincere commit-
ment to attend.
 A registration form is a valuable source of information about attendees
that you can use to follow up after the session or to solicit attendance at
future training.
 By using specific questions about student knowledge or experience, you
can better prepare for your class by tailoring material to your students’
needs.
If you select the Require Attendee Registration check box in this section of
the scheduling form, you then follow these steps to customize the registra-
tion form:

include various fields on the Registration Form, such as First Name,
Last Name, Phone Number, and so on.
3. Select check boxes in the column labeled R to require that certain
fields be completed in order to submit the form.
4. To create a custom question, click one of the buttons along the bottom
of the page:
• Text Box: Clicking this option brings up the form shown in Figure
11-15, on which you can enter a label or prompt and size parame-
ters for the text box.
• Check Boxes: Here you enter a label for the group of check boxes
as well as labels for each individual check box (see Figure 11-16).
• Radio Buttons: Note that what appears when you click the Radio
Buttons button is the same form that you see in Figure 11-16 for
Check Boxes. The only difference is that the selection in the Type
field is Radio Buttons. Radio buttons allow attendees to select only
one choice; check boxes allow multiple choices.

• Drop-Down List: Again, from the form shown in Figure 11-16, you
can create a label for the list, entering as many items as you like in
the Choice boxes. These appear when the arrow on the drop-down
box is clicked.

5. When you finish adding questions, you can use the two columns of
check boxes to specify whether a question should be included on your
registration form and whether an answer is required, as you did with
the contact information check boxes in Steps 3 and 4.
6. Click OK on the Customize Registration form to save your changes.
Inviting folks
If you set up a training session and nobody comes, is there any point? No.
That’s your next step: Getting students into your virtual classroom. You can
invite both attendees and presenters to your class by using the next two sec-
tions of the Schedule Training Session form.
Note that you can also invite attendees on the fly to a meeting in progress
by choosing Participant➪Invite, entering an e-mail address, and clicking the
Send Invitation button.
Scroll down to the Attendees section of the Schedule Training Session form.
From there, to create a list of folks to invite to your training event, just follow
these steps:
1. Click the List Attendees button.
The Invite Attendees page, as shown in Figure 11-17, appears.
Figure 11-17:
Enter

200
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

2. Enter a New Attendee’s name, e-mail address, and phone number in
the appropriate boxes and then click the Add Attendee button. (Note
that if you want to add this person to your Address Book, you should
select the Add New Attendee in My Address Book check box before
clicking this button.)
3. To choose an attendee from your Address Book, click the Select
Contacts button.
Your Address Book is displayed (see Figure 11-18).
4. Select the check boxes for all the people you want to invite, and then
click the Add Attendees button.
They are all added to your invitation list with one click.
5. Click the Invite button to finalize your invitation list.
The next section in the form allows you to invite presenters. Frankly, it involves
exactly the same steps given above to invite attendees, so feel free to give this
one a try all by yourself.
Choosing your particular session options
Few things in life are under your control, but you’ll be glad to hear that some
of the settings for your WebEx training session are among them. In the next
Figure 11-18:
The WebEx
Address
Book.
201
Chapter 11: Creating Virtual Classrooms with Training Center

section of the Schedule Training Session form, you can take control of options,
such as the privileges that your attendees have during your training session,
security settings, the message that greets attendees, and a URL to send folks
to after your session ends.
To adjust these settings, scroll to the Session Options section of the Schedule
Training Session form and follow these steps:
1. Click the Edit Options button.
The form shown in Figure 11-19 appears.
2. In the Session Options dialog box, you can tweak the following set-
tings and then click Save:
• Attendee Privileges: Select the check boxes for the things that you
want attendees to be able to do during a session, such as saving,
printing, and chatting.
• Security: You have two options here: You can keep the password
from being included in the e-mail sent to invite attendees to the
session, and you can require that attendees have an account on
your WebEx site to attend. You might exclude a password from the
e-mail if you’d rather provide the password in some other fashion,
Figure 11-19:
The Session
Options
form is
where you

attendee
privileges.
202
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

such as by phone or carrier pigeon. If any attendees are likely to
be outside of your organization, be sure that you don’t select the
Attendees Must Have an Account check box, or they might not be
able to get in. (There is a feature that allows you to turn on attendee
accounts for folks outside of your organization so they can join your
session even if this option is selected — but only if you purchase
this option.)
• Universal Communications Format (UCF): This is the format that
WebEx uses for sharing multimedia files. If you want attendees to
be able to share their own UCF files, select this check box.
• Preventing interruptions: If you want to mute attendees when
they enter the meeting so they won’t interrupt, select the check
box in this section. This option is available only if you use inte-
grated WebEx teleconferencing and not a third-party service.
3. Back in the Session Options section, if you like, enter a URL that you
want attendees to be directed to at the end of the session. This can be
your organization’s Web site or a site where you’ve set up a hands-on
lab, for example. This way your students can keep on working even
after your live session is over. 
4. In the Entry and Exit Tone field, choose Beep, Announce Name, or No
Tone from the drop-down list.
5. To set a customized greeting to your training session, click the
Customize Greeting Message When Attendee Joins link, enter your
message, and click OK.
E-mailing automatic reminders
In the Email Options section of the scheduling form, you can customize cer-
tain settings for the messages that will be sent to attendees and presenters,
including Invitations, Updates, Registrations, and Reminders. In each of these
sections, you can choose the types of automatic e-mails that you’d like to
send (such as a notification sent out if the session is rescheduled or can-
celled) and the timing schedule for those e-mails (see Figure 11-20).
Use the check boxes and drop-down lists to select the e-mail items that you
want to send as well as when you want them to go.
By default, the e-mails are sent from the address associated with your WebEx
user account; if you want your e-mails to be sent from another unique e-mail
account, just enter that address in the Via E-mail Address text box.
203
Chapter 11: Creating Virtual Classrooms with Training Center

Adding an agenda to keep things on track
The information page for your course appears when people first try to join
your session. The information that you can add here includes an agenda, a
description, and a graphic (your organization logo, a photo of the main pre-
senter, or an ice-breaking cartoon relevant to the topic come to mind).
In the Session Information section of the Schedule Training Session form (see
Figure 11-21), you can choose to display information in Plain Text or HTML,
and then enter your agenda and description in the appropriate boxes. You
can cut and paste these from elsewhere, if you like.
The benefit of using HTML text is that it’s nicer looking, but some browsers
don’t read it very well. Plain text can be read by one and all. 
To add a graphic to the information page, follow these steps:
1. Click the Import Picture button.
The Upload Your Picture dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-22, appears.
2. Click the Browse button; in the Choose File dialog box that opens,
select the file you want to upload and then click Open.
3. Click the Import button to upload it to WebEx.
Figure 11-20:

204
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

The final option in the Session Information section is whether you will dis-
play the Quick Start panel during the session. You can display it for the host
and presenters only or also for attendees. (You can’t display it only for atten-
dees.) The Quick Start panel contains a set of shortcuts that you can click to
access features, such as the whiteboard.
Uploading course materials and tests
Earlier in this chapter, in the section “Creating course materials,” I tell you
how to place files in your WebEx Files. I had a reason to suggest you do that
Figure 11-22:
Upload a
picture from
your hard
drive or a

205
Chapter 11: Creating Virtual Classrooms with Training Center

before I had you start scheduling a session: When you hit the Course Materials
portion of this form, you simply click Add Course Material and the Add Course
Material page shown in Figure 11-23 appears, with all the files in My Folders dis-
played. Select the check boxes of the various files and then click the Select
button to include them as course material.
Did you skip the section in this chapter on creating course materials? Did you
forget one teensy file when you added course materials? Not to worry; you
can add materials for your class while you fill out the scheduling form simply
by clicking the My Files link on the page shown in Figure 11-23. This takes you
to My Files, where you can upload additional files; then go back to the course
materials dialog box and select them.
You can add tests after you click the Schedule button at the bottom of the
scheduling form. You can create a new test on the confirmation screen that
appears (see the earlier section, “Creating tests,” to find out how to do this)
or copy a test that you already created. You can also set options for starting
the test with a live session or delivering it via a Web site.
Final steps — all set up!
Scroll to the bottom of the Scheduling form, and you find three buttons. One is
labeled Cancel, which would be a shame given all the input that you just made
(but things change, so if you must, you must). The other two are much more
productive choices. Click Start Session, and your session begins instantly.
Click Schedule, and a Session Scheduled page appears (see Figure 11-24).

To add tests to your course from the page in Figure 11-24, follow these steps:
1. Click the Add a Test link.
The Add Test page, as shown in Figure 11-25, appears.

2. Select one of the three options presented:
• Create a New Test: This option takes you to the page discussed in
the earlier section of this chapter, “Creating tests.” Follow the
steps in that section to create a new test.
• Copy an Existing Test from the Test Library: This option takes
you to the page shown in Figure 11-26, where you can select a test
and then click Next. You’re given an opportunity to edit the test;
then you click Save to save the test for this session.
• Import Test Questions: Choose this option if you used a Test and
Poll questionnaire during a previous session and saved it; it will be
converted into test format.
3. After you make your choice in Step 2, you return to the Session
Scheduled page. Click OK, and you are returned to the Training
Center Live Sessions view with all scheduled courses displayed.
Your course now appears on the list of training sessions in WebEx
(assuming you didn’t make it private), and appropriate e-mail invitations
are on their way.
You can now start your session by going to your My Meetings page in My
WebEx and clicking the Start link in the Status column for the meeting that
you want to begin.
Turning Training into an 
E-Commerce Machine
What if you’re in the business of providing training for a fee, or you want to
have each division in your company pay for their own training? Good news:
Training Center allows your customers to pay you for their training conve-
niently by using credit cards. 
Training Center E-commerce includes the following two features:
 Fee-based training (for attendees). With this feature attendees pay a fee
for attending your sessions. (For details, see the next section, “Setting
up fee-based training.”)
 Pay-per-use training (for hosts). This feature requires hosts to pay
before they can start each training session. (See the section, “Setting up
pay-per-use training,” for more about this.)
208
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

Setting up fee-based training
When you use fee-based training, attendees pay a fee to attend your sessions.
A fee-based training session requires that attendees register and provide
credit card information.
To require a session fee for a training session, type a U.S. dollar amount in
the Session Fee text box on the Schedule Training Session page.
Setting up pay-per-use training
Pay-per-use requires that hosts pay up front, before they can start each train-
ing session. Pay-per-use is designed for organizations that do not want to
deal with billing for every training session conducted on their Training
Center Web sites.
For example, an organization that allocates a training budget for each divi-
sion can now ask individual divisions to cover their own expenses for con-
ducting training on the organization’s Training Center Web site. Then the
organization can reimburse the costs. To turn on this E-commerce feature,
just contact your WebEx account manager.
To set up a pay-per-use training session:
1. Click Start Session or Schedule on the Schedule Training Session page
after you finish specifying options.
The Estimated Session Cost page appears. This page displays the esti-
mated cost of the session based on the number of people minutes, tele-
conferencing minutes, and the rate per minute. The number of people
minutes is the meeting duration multiplied by the number of computers
connected in the session. The number of teleconferencing minutes is the
session duration multiplied by the number of computers connected in
the teleconference.
2. Modify session settings (this is optional), and then click Change.
3. To return to the Estimated Session Cost page, click Start Session or
Schedule.
4. Enter your credit card information as instructed.
Setting Up an Instant Session
Although the Schedule Training Session form covered in the previous sec-
tions of this chapter is easy to complete, it does take some time. If you’re the
209
Chapter 11: Creating Virtual Classrooms with Training Center

instant coffee, instant ramen, instant gratification kind of person, you might
want a shortcut to starting a training session. That’s where Instant Sessions
come in.
From the Training Center tab of your WebEx site, follow these simple steps to
start an Instant Session:
1. In the Host a Session menu on the left, click the Instant Session link.
The Start an Instant Training Session form, as shown in Figure 11-26,
appears.
2. Enter the session topic and a password with confirmation.
3. Choose whether to make this an unlisted meeting and whether to use
teleconferencing.
4. Click the Start Session button.
The Teleconference page, as shown in Figure 11-27, appears.
5. If you chose to use teleconferencing in Step 3, on the screen that
appears choose None, the WebEx teleconference service, another 
service, or Internet Phone, and then click OK.
That’s it. The session begins. Now you can invite attendees from within the
training session by choosing Participant➪Invite and choosing either voice or
e-mail as your method.

For advice about participating in distance learning (learning via your com-
puter), I recommend that you buy Distance Learning Online For Dummies
(Wiley). Why, you ask? It helps you understand the world of online learning
and how to get the most out of it. Oh, and I wrote it. . . .
Using Training Tools
Many of the tools available in a training session are identical to the ones that
you use in any meeting. I cover these in Chapter 8, so I won’t repeat myself
here. However, I do want to provide a few tips about how to use these tools
specifically in a training environment as well as how to administer course
materials and tests.
Maximizing WebEx for training
Some of the WebEx meeting features discussed in the earlier chapters of this
book are also available within WebEx Training Center. The features that you
use in one way to meet with a client or project team can be used in other
ways for teaching in a training environment.
Figure 11-27:

Chapter 11: Creating Virtual Classrooms with Training Center

In WebEx Training Center, you can
 Train people on computer applications via the shared applications 
feature.
 Demonstrate how to set up a computer operating system or make set-
tings for your network by sharing your desktop with students.
 Use the whiteboard to sketch out concepts and processes and have stu-
dents try their own hands at making refinements.
 Administer tests to check on student progress.
 Generate reports on everything from attendance to test scores.
 Use the Chat feature to hold lively online discussions about course
material that students have read prior to the session.
 Offer prepackaged, self-paced training modules by recording training
sessions for later playback.
 Set up hands-on computer labs that can be accessed remotely at any
time, even during a training session.
In short, just about any bell or whistle that an online distance-learning
designer can create, you can mimic in a WebEx training session.
WebEx’s unique trainer’s dashboard
The Training Center environment offers several tools adapted specifically to
classroom needs that trainers and students can use to interact. Several feed-
back tools are located on the Participants panel, as shown in Figure 11-28.
Use these tools to do the following:
 Raise Hand allows a participant to alert the trainer that he or she has a
question or wants to stop the proceedings.
 Yes and No buttons allow students to reply instantly to an instructor’s
question, such as “Did everybody get that?”
 The Go Faster and Go Slower buttons are a way for students to give an
instructor an instant signal that things are lagging behind or rushing way
too fast for them. If one of these buttons is clicked, the corresponding
symbol appears next to the name of that student, but only on the
trainer’s dashboard.
 The Emoticon drop-down list allows attendees to click on their name
in the Participants panel and add an emoticon (such as Surprise!, or
Satisfied, or Have a Break) next to their name in the participant list.
212
Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

 The Feedback Results drop-down list lets an instructor instantly see how
many people have responded to a question that requires the Yes and No
buttons.
 The Clear tool lets you clear all icons (Yes, No, Go Faster, Go Slower, and
Emoticons) from participants’ Feedback columns.
Don’t forget the Pointer tool that appears on the Training Session toolbar
when you’re sharing a page, slide, or the whiteboard. Click it (it’s a big right-
facing arrow icon) and then move your mouse around a document or presen-
tation to cause an arrow with your name in it to appear on your students’
computer screens. This helps you draw attention to important information
on the topic at hand.

Sharing course materials
When people register for your test, the course materials that you assign
during the scheduling process appear as links. The attendee can click those
links to download the files.
When you’re actually running the session, the course material that you add
when scheduling the session is displayed automatically when the session
starts. If you uploaded several course material files, there will be a tab for
each file (see Figure 11-29); click the tab to display that file.
If you are running an Instant Session and want to show materials, choose
Share➪Presentation or Document, select the document that you want to
share, and click the Open button. The document or presentation is displayed.
Using Hands-on Lab
Starting a hands-on lab from within a training session is simplicity itself.
Choose Lab➪Start Hands-on Lab. If you want to record what students do
during the lab, choose Lab➪Hands-on Lab Options, select the Record Remote
Computers Automatically When Participants Connect check box, and click OK.

Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

If you start your meeting outside of the time when you originally scheduled it
and you try to start a hands-on lab, you get a message that tells you that you
reserved the lab for a different time. You have to access the lab at the origi-
nally scheduled time, or end your meeting, and schedule a new one with the
lab starting right now, then start the meeting again.
Time for a test!
When you enter a training session, one of the panels is labeled Testing. To
start a test, open this panel (see Figure 11-30), click a test that you want to
start, and click the Launch for All button.
The instructor sees the screen shown in Figure 11-31, with various control
options. The student sees the test (see Figure 11-32).

When a student finishes, he clicks the Save Answers button and then the
Submit Test button. The instructor can select a student and then click the
View and Score Answers button to view submitted tests (see Figure 11-33).
The instructor can also enter overall comments in a text box provided at the
top of the test.

Part IV: Selling, Supporting, and Training with WebEx 

Don’t forget to use WebEx’s reporting capabilities to put your training on
target. Reports can help you track attendance, results of tests, and registra-
tion information to spot trends and help you modify to your promotion or
content accordingly. You can also integrate data from reports with learning
management systems that you might have in place. See Chapter 12 for all the
details about reporting with WebEx.
Recording Sessions for Posterity
Chapter 8 (a hotbed of information) covers the process of recording a ses-
sion. This is an especially good idea for training. Recorded training sessions
become self-paced training for those who weren’t around for the live session.
You can add recorded sessions to the recorded sessions library by using My
Files. Over time, you can build up a library of prerecorded training sessions.
These can be accessed through the Training Center by clicking the Recorded
Sessions link on the Attend a Session menu.
Self-paced training can become out of date, so keep track of when sessions
were recorded. If the information presented gets slightly out of date, you can
always supplement the recording with a page of printed updates. When it
gets too out of date, just record a more recent session and ditch the old one
by going to My Files from My WebEx, selecting the file, and deleting it.

Part V
Taking WebEx
Further

In this part . . .
T
hey say that one’s reach should always exceed one’s
grasp. So why should you stop at the basic ins and
outs of using WebEx? Once you have the knack for sched-
uling and holding meetings and events online with WebEx,
you might want to consider a few advanced topics. 
This part is about two topics: generating and using reports
about your WebEx activities; and administering your
WebEx site, including setting up user accounts, handling
security issues, and configuring general site settings.

Chapter 12
Making the Most of Reports
In This Chapter
 Exploring reporting options
 Generating reports
 Introducing GlobalWatch
 Making use of reports
S
o your department has jumped on the WebEx bandwagon in a big way
and been happily using it to meet and support customers for several
months. Your boss pulls you aside after a long, boring offline meeting and
asks how productive WebEx is for your team. You promise to get back to him
with specific information the next day.
You now have three choices:
1. Run around to everybody in your department and ask them whether
they remember exactly how many WebEx meetings they attended in the
last few months, how many people attended, what kind of feedback they
got from support sessions, and on and on. (This will produce a lot of
pained looks from your staff, I guarantee you.)
2. Have your assistant tell your boss you were abducted by aliens and
therefore can’t get back to him about this.
3. Run a few WebEx reports.
Call me crazy, but I vote for Number 3. Here, then, are the ins and outs of the
WebEx report feature.

Who’s Reporting Whom?
Reports in WebEx come in two flavors: the reports that any meeting host 
can generate through My WebEx, and the more sophisticated performance
reports that a WebEx site administrator can generate to monitor enterprise-
wide use of WebEx through an add-on product called GlobalWatch.
This chapter covers both types of reporting. The first two sections deal with
host-level reports; the section “Meet GlobalWatch” gives you the lowdown on
administrator-level reporting.
Eyeing the Reporting Landscape
Depending on which WebEx applications your company is using, you have
different reports available to you as someone who hosts WebEx meetings. If,
for example, you use Sales Center and Meeting Center, you have sales reports
and some usage and attendance reports available. If you use the Support
Center, you can generate a log of support sessions, and so on.
Generally speaking, whatever WebEx applications you bought, reports avail-
able in your WebEx site cover certain key information at varying levels of
detail:
 Usage: How many meetings you have run of a certain type, how long
they were, and so on.
 Enrollment and Attendance: How many people registered, and how
many attended? You can also get details about attendees in this type of
report.
 Access Anywhere: If you use Access Anywhere to connect with remote
computers (see Chapter 5 for details), you can get some information
about that activity through reports.
 Details: A few reports also show details about online meetings or 
sessions, such as attendee details or archived files accessed.
Often, when a report is displayed, some items in it are formatted as links.
Click these links to see more details. For example, in a report listing meetings
that you ran in a certain timeframe, click a particular meeting’s link, and
details about that meeting appear.
222
Part V: Taking WebEx Further 

Let’s Make a Report!
If you’re the type who hosts meetings, generating a report in WebEx is sim-
plicity itself. The information is all in there, and you don’t have much control
over the report design. You just pick the report that you want to run, specify
information such as attendee name or a date range, and that’s it.
Where you find meeting host reports
Reports live in the My WebEx area of your WebEx site if your site administra-
tor has turned this option on for your account. Go to the My WebEx page and
click My Reports to display a list of available reports, similar to the one
shown in Figure 12-1.
What is available to you differs depending on the WebEx services that you
purchased. But if you went for the full enchilada (WebEx Enterprise Edition
with all the available services), you have the following report features avail-
able to you:
Figure 12-1:

223
Chapter 12: Making the Most of Reports

 All Services, Usage Report shows you the usage across any services
that you purchased.
 WebEx Access Anywhere provides reports on access of remote 
computers. (See Chapter 5 for the lowdown on Access Anywhere.)
 Event Center includes four types of reports about marketing events:
Enrollment and Attendee Report, Attendee Details Report, Archived
Files Access Report, and Actual Attendee Report.
 The link to Sales Center Reports accesses a Sales Meeting Report.
 Support Center provides a Customer Service Representative (CSR)
Activity Log Query.
 The Training Center offers both the Live Training Usage Report and
Recorded Training Access Report.
Running a report
If you haven’t done anything with your WebEx account since you signed up,
reports won’t do you much good because they provide information about
your WebEx activity. But, assuming that you’ve been working with WebEx
even a bit, you’ve unknowingly (and from this point on, knowingly) generated
information about your meetings, events, and sessions that could come in
very handy.
Creating most reports requires similar steps: You find the report by going to
the My Reports page, clicking the report, identifying a date range or other
information, and then running the report. I’ll step you through one so you get
the feel for it. A Usage Report for all services that you have available is a
good candidate for a dry run because it will be available no matter what com-
bination of services you have chosen.
To run a Usage Report for all the services your company has access to, follow
these steps:
1. Go to the My WebEx page of your WebEx site.
2. Choose the My Reports menu.
3. Under All Services, click the Usage Report link.
The Usage Report page, as shown in Figure 12-2, appears.

Some typical reports
The preceding section was like an appetizer: It showed you how to generate
one report, but left you wanting more. Generating any WebEx report is equally
simple. But so I don’t leave you hungry, I’ll give you a taste of some of the
other reports that you might have at your disposal.
Figure 12-4 shows a Live Training Usage Summary, and Figure 12-5 shows a
CSR Activity Log Query. Here’s the type of information that you find in these
reports:
 The Live Training Usage Summary appropriately summarizes live train-
ing through Training Center versus activity involving playback of
recorded training sessions for self-paced training. You generate this
report by entering a date range. The report contains information on ses-
sion topics; start time; duration; and attendees, including how many
were invited, how many registered, the total number who attended, and
the number who were absent. If you click any specific meeting’s link, you
get a more detailed report for that meeting, with each participant listed
so you can see exactly who registered, attended, and so on.
 The CSR Activity Log Query gives you information on support sessions
that you ran using Support Center. You generate this report by entering
some criteria such as Support Session Number, company name, or satis-
faction rating, as well as a date range. If you prefer, you can search by
date only or by criteria only. The report shows the date and time of each

Meet WebEx GlobalWatch
™
GlobalWatch takes reporting into the realm of your system administrator.
GlobalWatch is an add-on service to WebEx that gives your site administrator
a comprehensive view of the performance of your WebEx meeting service.
GlobalWatch provides your site administrator with real-time and historical
performance information (which networking-inclined types refer to as latency)
for each meeting and each individual attendee who came to your meeting.
(See Figure 12-7.) GlobalWatch provides the following detailed meeting 
information: 
 User information, including the type of WebEx client that each person
used (Java or Active-X).
 The type of browser that each person used (Internet Explorer, Netscape,
or Firefox).
 The operating system on each user’s computer (Windows, Mac OS,
Linux, Unix).
 The IP address that each user connected from.
 A timestamp that tells you when each user joined and left the meeting.

 An overview of all the services that were used during your WebEx ses-
sion. These services might have included presentation sharing, applica-
tion or desktop sharing, WebEx audio conferencing, or WebEx video
conferencing.
 The average delay, measured in five-minute intervals, between the
WebEx meeting switch and the individual attendee’s computer.
GlobalWatch also provides your site administrators with
 An overview of all pending and resolved trouble tickets. Trouble tickets
are records of support calls customers make.
 Detailed reports of usage across your company and by department. This
includes statistical information about the total number of meetings,
attendees, and duration. Your site administrator can also run an excep-
tion report that includes all meetings that experienced a high latency
(more than 1,000 milliseconds).
 The ability to proactively monitor the availability of the WebEx meeting
service and to measure the performance from specific locations on the
customer’s network back to WebEx.
GlobalWatch empowers your site administrator by providing many proactive
tools that can be used to better manage and control your WebEx meeting site.
Now I Have a Report: 
What Do I Do With It?
The whole point of putting all this information at your fingertips is for you to
make use of it (and show your boss how much money you’re saving by using
online meetings). Here are some of the ways how you might use the reporting
features of WebEx and GlobalWatch:
 Examine or calculate ROI of online meetings by generating regular
reports of usage (see Figure 12-8).
 Review attendance figures to ensure that regular sessions or meetings
you’re running are being promoted adequately.
 Compare those who enroll for events with those who attend to see
whether you should generate more meeting reminders to draw people in.
 Identify departments that are not taking advantage of more frequent
online communications by scanning usage reports for underutilization.
229
Chapter 12: Making the Most of Reports

 Look at the archived files that are being most often accessed to 
identify areas of training that many people need help with.
 Use department coding features in GlobalWatch to charge costs of 
meetings to departments or customers.
 Review meeting and attendee performance information in GlobalWatch
so that you can better support your end-user base and shorten the time
to resolution of problems reported by your end users.
As with any report data, the significance is directly related to your needs and
business strategies. But if you think that you could use some data about your
WebEx account activity, odds are that WebEx has anticipated that need either
in its built-in reporting or through GlobalWatch.
The specific reports available are likely to be changed or added to over time.
Check the My Reports menu on your My WebEx site to explore all the reports
available to you.

 Understanding what an administrator does
 Logging in as an administrator
 Viewing information about your site
 Working with user accounts
 Modifying e-mail templates
 Managing company contacts
 Controlling security settings
T
he comprehensive suite of on-demand applications that WebEx offers for
functions such as online meetings, marketing events, customer support,
training, and sales is a boon to your business, it’s true. But just who is going
to manage this thing? (All eyes slowly turn toward the IT guy/gal, knowing
that he/she will take care of everything.) Well, overworked IT guy/gal: This
chapter’s for you.
Just what is your company letting itself in for if it sets up a WebEx account? If
you’ve bought into more than a pay-per-use solution from WebEx, you need
to designate a site administrator who can set up user accounts, track your
WebEx activity, manage security settings, and set up and maintain a company
list of contacts. If your company is small and holds only a few meetings, an
administrative assistant might be a good choice for your site administrator. If
your company is larger or more meeting-active, the role probably ought to
belong to somebody in the IT department.
In this chapter, I take a look at some of the common practices that site adminis
trators must perform. Many other options and configurations in site adminis-
tration are not covered here. But don’t worry: As usual, WebEx documentation
and support resources take you by the hand and give you training and docu-
mentation of specific procedures and practices when you sign up. And, thank-
fully, online help is available to guide you through all the options. Just click
the Help link in the navigation bar on your administration site.

What Do WebEx Administrators Do?
WebEx Site Administration (see Figure 13-1) provides tools that help you
easily manage your organization’s WebEx service site.
You can use Site Administration to
 View information about your organization’s WebEx service, including its
configuration and features.
 Add, modify, or deactivate user accounts.
 Maintain a company address book that includes contact information
that all users can use when inviting attendees to meetings.
 Process requests to sign up for an account on your WebEx service site
(if your site includes the signup option).
 Customize templates for e-mail messages that your WebEx service sends
to users (if your site has the e-mail templates option).
 Manage Access Anywhere (if your site includes the Access Anywhere
option).

 Manage security options for your WebEx service, including password
requirements.
 Set up tracking codes that let you track usage of your WebEx service.
 Customize the Navigation bars on your WebEx service site.
 Specify configuration preferences for your organization’s WebEx 
service site.
 Manage options for the specific services that your WebEx site includes.
 View a list of meetings, training sessions, support sessions, events, or
Access Anywhere sessions in progress on your WebEx service site.
 View a list of remote computers that users have set up for Access
Anywhere, and determine which computers users are currently 
accessing remotely.
 View detailed usage reports.
First Things First: Logging In and Out
To log in to Site Administration, you must first have an administrator account.
WebEx creates an initial administrator account for your organization when
you sign up.
Confused about your account? If you have any questions about administrator
accounts, just contact your WebEx account manager.
Follow these steps to log in to Site Administration:
1. Enter your Site Administration URL in your browser address bar.
The URL for Site Administration is in this format:
http://your_company.webex.com/your_company/admin.php
where your_company is the brand name for your WebEx service.
2. On the page that appears (see Figure 13-2), type your user name in the
User Name box.
3. Type your password in the Password box.
4. Click the Log In button.
The Home page appears (refer to Figure 13-1), showing information
about your organization’s WebEx service.
233
Chapter 13: Administering WebEx Made Easy

To log out of Site Administration, click Log Out on the Navigation bar.
If your company has the Enterprise Edition of WebEx, after you log into your
WebEx site, you can see a button in the horizontal navigation bar that takes
you to the Site Administration page. If there is no room on the navigation bar,
this button appears in the More Services menu.
To use Site Administration, your WebEx user account must have the Site
Administrator privilege. If your account has full administrative privileges, you
can go to town and change any settings in Site Administration you like. If
your account has read-only administrative privileges, you can view all infor-
mation and settings in Site Administration, but you can’t change any settings.
Taking a Look at Your Site’s Information
Information is any administrator’s lifeblood. You need to be able to quickly
review your site’s settings to know who your users are and what WebEx 
features your organization is taking advantage of.
You can view the following information about your organization’s WebEx 
service site on your site administration home page:

 The brand name for your WebEx service Web site
 The type of WebEx service for which your organization has an account
 The user names of the administrators for your site
 The number of users who have accounts on your organization’s WebEx
service site
 The version of your WebEx service
 The types of meetings that users can host using your organization’s
WebEx service site
 The features that are available with your organization’s WebEx service
site (as shown in Figure 13-3)
This information appears when you first log on to the site. To view the infor-
mation at any time, click the Home button on the Navigation bar. The Home
page appears, showing you all the bells and whistles of your WebEx service.
You can also take a peek at who’s doing what by viewing a list of meetings,
training sessions, support sessions, events, or Access Anywhere sessions
that are currently in progress on your WebEx service site.

support sessions, events, or Access Anywhere sessions that are currently 
in progress.
Working with User Accounts
Users come in all shapes and sizes, from your IT manager and the CEO to 
the company receptionist and field sales person. Each of these folks needs
different things from your WebEx service. The roles that they play in meet-
ings typically determine what kind of user accounts they should get as well
as what sorts of privileges.
Figure 13-4:

236
Part V: Taking WebEx Further 

Who’s who?
You can add any number of user accounts, but your organization’s contract
with WebEx usually limits the number of users who can actually host or
attend meetings, training sessions, support sessions, or events, or access
remote computers at any one time.
Users don’t have to have user accounts to attend meetings, training sessions,
support sessions, or events unless a host selects the option that a user
account is required to attend when setting the meeting up.
Here’s a rundown of the various types of user accounts:
 Host only: This specifies that the user can use your organization’s WebEx
service site to host meetings, training sessions, support sessions, or
events, depending on your site type.
 Site Admin: This is the user who can use your organization’s WebEx 
service as a host and use Site Administration to administer your 
WebEx service. In other words, this is probably you.
Because a Site Administrator can manage user accounts, handle regis-
tration requests, and specify preferences for your organization’s WebEx
service, WebEx recommends that you have only one or two Site Admin-
istrator accounts to avoid confusion.
 Site Admin - View Only: This is like Site Admin Lite. If you specify this
option when setting up an account, the user can use your organization’s
WebEx service as a host and use Site Administration to view user account
information, registration requests, and WebEx configuration and prefer-
ences. However, a site administrator with view-only privileges can’t make
changes to user account information or change settings for your organi-
zation’s site.
 Attendee only: If the Attendee accounts option is enabled on your site,
this user can log in to your WebEx service Web site to attend meetings,
but that’s it. The user can use My WebEx to maintain his or her profile
and to view a list of meetings to which he or she is invited but can’t
actually host meetings on your site.
Adding a user account
You can either add user accounts one at a time or add multiple user accounts
simultaneously, using a batch process.
237
Chapter 13: Administering WebEx Made Easy

If your organization’s WebEx service site includes the account signup option,
you can also add users by accepting requests to signup for an account on your
site. This feature is available for both Host accounts and Attendee accounts.
Usually, attendees just set up their own Attendee account through the account
signup option.
Follow these steps to add a user account:
1. On the Navigation bar, under Manage Users, click Add User.
The Add User page appears (see Figure 13-5).
2. Specify account information as follows:
a. Select an option at the top of the page to designate the account
type.
b. Specify the user’s first name, last name, user name, password, and
e-mail address.
c. To automatically notify a user that an account has been created,
select the Send “Welcome” Email to This Host When Account Is
Created check box.
d. Set the appropriate privileges, such as the services for which the
user is allowed to host meetings and the session types for each

238
Part V: Taking WebEx Further 

WebEx service. Set the account’s privileges for WebEx Telephony
options, such as Call-in, Call-back third-party teleconferencing, and
Internet Phone (VoIP). You can enable General tools, such as the
Recording Editor, as well as service-specific options, such as the
Hands-on Lab Admin for Training Center, or Sales Rep for Sales
Center.
e. In the My WebEx section of the form, you can allocate additional
storage space on your WebEx site for a user by entering a value in
MB in the Additional Storage field.
f. Other information — such as the user’s phone number, address,
language, and time zone — is optional.
3. Click Add.
Site Administration adds the user account to the list of accounts on the
Edit User List.
Specifying privileges for user accounts
We’re not all born with the same privileges. Some people come complete 
with silver spoons dangling from their mouths; others aren’t so lucky. But in
the world of WebEx, it’s the Site Administrator who decides who gets what 
privileges.
You can change the privilege assignments for a user account at any time by
specifying the following:
 The types of meetings that a user can host on your WebEx site. Session
types determine which services and features a user can use.
 Whether a user can use My WebEx Standard or My WebEx Pro features.
To see the features available for each type, click the link at the head of
the STD or PRO columns in the Edit User List page, which you can display
by scrolling to the right from the screen you can see in Figure 13-6)
 Which teleconferencing services a user can take advantage of during a
meeting or training session, such as toll-free call-in or call-back.
 You can temporarily deactivate a user account at any time. While a
user account is deactivated, the user cannot host meetings using your
organization’s WebEx service site. You can reactivate a deactivated user
account at any time. This can be useful when you want to set up new
users but not activate their accounts until they are approved by 
management.
239
Chapter 13: Administering WebEx Made Easy

Part V: Taking WebEx Further 
You can change the privileges for either all user accounts simultaneously 
or only specific user accounts. However, if you change privileges for all
accounts, you can still modify those privileges for specific accounts.
1. On the Navigation bar, under Manage Users, click Edit User List.
The Edit User List page, as shown in Figure 13-6, appears.
2. Locate the user account in the list.
To quickly locate a user account, do one of the following:
• Type the user’s user name in the User Name box and click Search.
• Type the user’s e-mail address in the Email box and click Search.
• In the Index, click the letter that corresponds to the first character
in the user name.
• In the Index, click # to list any user names that begin with a
number.
3. To make a user account active or inactive, select or clear (respec-
tively) the Active check box for the account; then click Submit.
4. To change the session types that a user can host, or the features of
MyWebEx (Standard or Pro) the user has access to, select or clear the
check boxes in the Session Types and My WebEx columns. Then click
Submit.

5. To edit details about a user account, click the link for the account
under Name.
The Edit User page, as shown in Figure 13-7, appears.
6. Specify new account information.
7. Click Update to save your changes.
To make it easier to find an individual user, you can sort the list of users by
selecting an option in the Sort List By drop-down list. You can sort the list in
ascending order according to user first names or last names, e-mail domains
(that is, the text that follows the @ symbol in an e-mail address), or the time
when you created the account.
Finally, note that you cannot remove a user account from your WebEx service
site by using Site Administration. However, you can make an account inactive
(see the previous steps), change the information about the account, or assign
it to another user.

Chapter 13: Administering WebEx Made Easy

242
Part V: Taking WebEx Further 
Managing E-Mail Templates
Your WebEx service is designed to save you time and effort. One of the ways
how it does this is to automatically send e-mail messages to meeting or ses-
sion attendees, invitees, and hosts when certain events happen. For example,
if a host invites attendees when she schedules a meeting, your WebEx service
automatically sends a nice little invitation e-mail message to each invited
attendee. If she also chooses to, she can specify that a reminder e-mail should
go out a day before the meeting, and so on.
Site Administration holds the key to the template for each e-mail message that
your WebEx service sends out. If the option to edit e-mail templates is
enabled on your site, you can change the default messages to customize
them for your specific needs by editing, rearranging, or deleting the text and
variables (code text that your WebEx service recognizes and substitutes with
your specific user or site information). But don’t worry if you decide later
that you want to be more generic: You can also revert any e-mail template to
its default version at any time.
You can modify the template for any e-mail messages that your WebEx service
automatically sends to users, but keep in mind that Site Administration might
include e-mail templates that are not applicable to your WebEx service.
To modify an e-mail template, follow these steps:
1. On the Navigation bar, under Manage Site, click Email Templates.
The E-mail Templates page appears, showing a list of all e-mail templates
that are available for your WebEx service.
2. If your WebEx site has multiple services, under Existing Email
Templates For, select the service for which you want to modify 
e-mail templates.
3. Under Email Name, click the link for the template that you want to
modify.
The Edit Email Message page appears, showing the content and variables
in the e-mail message.
4. Modify the text and remove or rearrange variables as necessary.
Be sure that you don’t modify the text code for variables and that a 
percent sign (%) precedes and follows all variables.
5. Click Update.

Maintaining Company Contacts
When folks set up meetings, sessions, and events via WebEx, they have to
designate who will attend. This can include attendees, presenters, or 
in-support-sessions people to assist in the session. The host can choose these
folks from a company address book when the meeting is being set up. Guess
who gets to set up the company address book and populate it with contacts?
(Yup. You.)
Importing contacts
I just know that for years, your company has been storing contact informa-
tion somewhere on your network, and you groan at the thought of having
to reenter all that information into yet another online Address Book. Never
fear: You can import lists of contacts from Microsoft Outlook or any comma-
delimited file. A comma-separated-values files (CSV) is a kind of data file in
which commas are used to separate fields of data. You might save an Excel
spreadsheet of contact information as a comma-delimited file and import that
file into WebEx’s Address Book, for example.
Note that you control the company address book, but individual users can
also create personal contact lists from their My WebEx pages.
Follow these steps to import a list of contacts from Outlook:
1. In the Navigation bar of the Site Administration site, click the
Company Addresses link.
The Company Address Book page, as shown in Figure 13-8, appears.
2. Click the Import button.
3. In the Batch Import Contacts page that appears (see Figure 13-9)
choose Microsoft Outlook in the Method 1 drop-down list.
The other options in this list are Exchange, which offers more advanced
options only for those who feel expert at importing data tasks, and .csv
file import. (See the upcoming Tip for more about this option.)
4. Click the Import button.
A message appears: Importing Outlook Address Book. Just relax and
chant your mantra while your computer does its thing — it could take a
few moments, depending on just how many contacts you’ve stuffed into
Outlook.

If your company doesn’t use Outlook, you can use the comma-delimited file
option. To import a comma-delimited file of contacts (such as an Excel spread-
sheet saved as a comma-delimited file), enter a filename in the Method 2 field
shown in Figure 13-9 and proceed with your import.
Adding contacts one by one
After you get the bulk of your contacts into WebEx, from time to time, you’ll
want to add a new contact. You can easily add a contact to WebEx from the
Company Address Book page (refer to Figure 13-8) by following these steps:
1. Click the Add button.
The form shown in Figure 13-10 appears.
2. Fill in whatever fields you want to include; the required Full Name
and Email Address fields are enough to invite somebody to a meeting,
but everything else is optional.
3. Click the Add button. That’s it!

Editing contacts
Charlie used to work at Apex Toys but moved to Toys Is We; Mary got mar-
ried, and now her last name is Dipplewithe; Claude changed his cellphone
provider. . . .
You get the idea: Nothing is forever. In our hurly-burly world, contact infor-
mation for people is often as changeable as the weather in spring. Here, then,
are the simple steps involved in editing a contact to get his or her information
up to date.
1. With the Company Address Book page displayed, click the name of
the contact that you want to edit.
The person’s contact information is displayed. (This is the page shown
in Figure 13-10.)
2. Change the contents of any field you wish to change and then click
the Update button.
Exporting contacts
After you spend all this time getting contacts into your WebEx Address Book,
you shouldn’t have to duplicate the effort to get that data in Excel. Well, good
news. You don’t have to. Here’s how to export your WebEx contact list to Excel:
1. From the Company Address Book page, click the Export button.
2. In the File Download dialog box that appears (see Figure 13-11), 
click Save.
The Save As dialog box appears.

The file is saved in the comma-separated-value format in the specified
location.
Now use the Import feature in Excel to import this file of contacts.
Deleting contacts
Time for something easy. To delete a contact, select the check box in front 
of it on the Company Address Book page and click the Delete link. Bye-bye,
contact!
It’s All about Security
Security is a hot topic these days, near and dear to any administrator’s heart.
You’ll be happy to hear that you can use Site Administration to provide secu-
rity for your WebEx service site.
What’s in your control
By adjusting various settings, you can require any of the following:
 Users have to specify a password for any meetings that they host. 
No password, no meeting.
 All meeting passwords must be in a strict password format that you
specify and cannot contain any specified text strings or words.
 All user account passwords must be in a strict password format that 
you specify.
 All meetings must be unlisted — that is, they must not appear on your
site’s public calendar. This provides additional security for your meetings
because meeting information is not displayed publicly. To join an unlisted
meeting, attendees have to provide a unique meeting number that they
get from the host.
 All attendees must provide their e-mail addresses to join a meeting.
 All requests to send a forgotten user password must be approved.
 All users must log in to your WebEx service site. If you choose this
option, all users must have a user account and log in to view anything
on your site. This effectively makes your site a private meeting site.

 With Site Administration, you can provide security for your WebEx 
service site by requiring restrictions for the following:
• Access to your WebEx service site
• Access to meetings on your WebEx service site
• User names and passwords for accounts
• The length and format in which users can specify passwords
• Access to a user’s shared folders or Personal Meeting Room page
• The access code for access to remote computers through Access
Anywhere
Specifying security options
Site Administration provides you with several options for preventing unau-
thorized folks from accessing or using your WebEx service site. These
options let you choose the ideal level of security for your service.
To specify security options:
1. On the Navigation bar, under Manage Site, click Site Preferences.
The Site Preferences page, as shown in Figure 13-12, appears.

3. Click Update to save your changes.
A word about password protection
The All Meetings Must Have a Password item

ommends that you activate this option if it’s not
already to help ensure the security of meetings
on your site. If you also select the Apply Strict
Password check box, you can use additional
settings in the Strict Password Criteria section
that follows to control passwords more tightly.
Here are some of the criteria that you can
manage in the Strict Password Criteria section:
 The password length; by default this must
be at least six characters, but you can
specify a different minimum length.
 The password cannot contain any text that
appears on the Meeting Calendar page,
such as the host’s name or the meeting
topic.
 The password cannot be an easy-to-guess
word, such as meeting or password. You
include such words in the Do Not Allow
Meeting Passwords from This List section.
Note that these criteria apply only to the
Meeting Center, Training Center, Event Center,
and Sales Center sites. Support Center is the
odd man out here.

W
hen does a company become an enterprise? The day you don’t get to
say good morning to everybody in the company because some of
them are a five-minute walk or five-hour flight away might just be the day
you’ve crossed into the realm of an enterprise. That’s the day you’re big
enough to have to make a special effort to ensure that everybody is on the
same page about things like company goals and policies, order status, new
product announcements, and so on.
When you cross that enterprise line, you need extra help facilitating state-of-
the-art communications to prevent chaos. WebEx can be a big part of your
enterprise communications strategy, and the Enterprise Edition will become
your new best friend.
In this chapter, you discover some of the features that make WebEx a perfect
fit for any enterprise. Some of the features that help your enterprise come
with your garden-variety WebEx account, and some are strictly available in
the Enterprise Edition. Talk to your WebEx account manager to figure out
how to get set up to take advantage of the ones you need.

Security, Security, Security
Security is of special concern to enterprises, which typically have to share
information between geographically diverse departments, offices, vendors,
and customers in safe ways.
The MediaTone Network, owned by WebEx, doesn’t involve any third-party
folks in transmitting data, so you don’t have to worry about information going
astray. And what goes on in your meeting is never stored, only transmitted.
Finally, you can experience media-rich presentations both inside and outside
your own corporate firewall and you can define and enforce your own security
policies for online meetings.
Things Change: Scalability
Because WebEx is a Web service, it grows or shrinks along with your needs.
You don’t have to invest in server and software maintenance, so if more
employees need to participate in online meetings, there’s no new IT invest-
ment.
Tailored packages can offer savings with unlimited product training services,
including access to self-paced modules, unlimited Service Assist sessions,
and cost-effective meeting access packages.
Through My WebEx, users in your enterprise can access whatever WebEx 
services they need from a single place with a single login.
We Just Opened Our 
500th Branch Office 
If your enterprise is located all over the map, WebEx is a perfect solution for
your communication needs. As long as people have a computer with Internet
access they can access meetings, files, support, and training. Whether you
want to provide consistent training to thousands of employees around the
world, or effective support to customers from Tangiers to Tallahassee, this
centralized online service helps you keep your many offices, people in the
field, vendors, and customers connected.

Chapter 14: Ten Things WebEx Can Do For Your Enterprise
Getting Decision Makers 
What They Need
The ability to initiate One-Click Meetings and share documents and applica-
tions means that people who make decisions can get together instantly and
access the information they need.
If you’re a bean counter who must make decisions about your online meeting
solution, use WebEx usage history and recorded access history to see just
how much your people are getting out of the service.
Enterprise-Powered Collaboration
Everybody, from project teams to department workgroups, can use WebEx to
enhance collaboration. Being able to pull the team together wherever they
are through an online meeting can be a powerful tool for efficiency. In addi-
tion, the ability to share applications, such as a project management software
package with up-to-the minute project data, and files, such as a spreadsheet
with budget data, enables teams and workgroups to stay on the same page.
Supporting protocols
MediaTone technology, which underlies all of
WebEx’s offerings, is built to deliver rich-media
content to a huge number of customer devices,
so your CEO can get into a meeting via his cell
phone, and your CFO can dial in via Internet
Phone. (If what follows is geek to you, just hand
this page to your IT team — they’ll thank you 
for it.)
Supported standards include
 H.323, the leading protocol for Voice over
Internet Protocol (VoIP)
 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), used for
conferencing via Internet Protocol (IP)
phone or instant messenger devices
 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP), a vendor-independent network
directory protocol that provides directory
server integration for WebEx services
 Extensible Markup Language (XML)
 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
 Aviation Industry CBT Committee (AICC)
protocol
 Sharable Content Object Reference Model
(SCORM)

WebEx meeting features, such as the Whiteboard for group brainstorming
and annotation tools to mark up shared documents, offer the possibility of an
interactive environment that goes far beyond sketching ideas on paper.
As reported in Fortune magazine’s November 29, 2004 issue, many large com-
panies like ChevronTexaco, Sun Life Financial and Georgia-Pacific are taking
advantage of the Internet to run brainstorming sessions that allow people in
far-flung locations to meet and brainstorm online.
Speaking the Language: 
Localized Versions
Today, business is not confined to any geographical borders. Increasingly,
companies must broaden their borders to encompass employees, vendors,
and customers around the world.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do, right? Well, what if you’re French,
German, Swedish, Chinese, Japanese, or Korean? No problem. Enterprise
Edition has localized Meeting Center versions in all those languages. Instant
Global Village!
Teleconferencing Your Way
You say you’re already set up with your own teleconferencing system and
don’t want to rock the boat by switching to WebEx for teleconferencing serv
ices? No problem. WebEx lets you use either its teleconferencing services or
your existing teleconferencing solution. It’s up to you.
Lowering Your Costs
Using WebEx can save you money in more ways than I have time to explore
here. But if you’ve got an enterprise, consider these typical ways you can
save money. With WebEx you can
 Accelerate and streamline processes used to deliver and support prod-
ucts and services.
 Reduce costs associated with lost cycles, deferred decisions, and unnec-
essary travel and facility expenses.
 Have control over online meeting costs because of usage-based cost
allocations that enterprise subscription pricing offers.
256
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Provide ongoing training at a much reduced cost. Bottom line: A better-
trained workforce means more profits.
 Purchase subscription minutes that you can use for any WebEx service.
That means you just pick and choose the right tool for any job without
worrying about the costs.
 Give your accounting folks a way to manage costs and control account-
ability by using integrated tracking numbers.
 Experience rapid deployment of WebEx, made possible because you
don’t have to install hardware or software on site. You usually don’t
have to configure or integrate enterprise software or firewalls, either.
Getting Dedicated Support
If your enterprise is large, you could have employees meeting 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, in various parts of the world. You can’t afford to lose your
online meeting support for even an hour. That’s why WebEx provides premium
support services for enterprises.
Enterprise Edition users get
 A dedicated 800 number for anytime access
 A single Service Level Agreement (SLA)
 Unlimited Service Assist sessions
Integration Rules!
Enterprise. . . the word conjures up images of Star Trek. . . I mean, Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP), right? So if you are utilizing enterprise solutions in
your organization, you’ll be glad to hear that your enterprise can easily inte-
grate WebEx services within existing corporate applications for accounting,
CRM (Customer Resource Management), ERP, human resources, and others.
WebEx fits within your business processes that you already know and love.
This means that you can run any enterprise software application to share
data with employees, provide demos to customers, or offer training to
employees without ever leaving the original application.
Beam me up, Scotty!
One more feature enterprise types will like: You can configure WebEx services
to reflect your corporate look, extending branding across your enterprise.

Top Nine Frequently Asked
Questions from WebEx Tech
Support
In This Chapter
 Getting advice about scheduling and running meetings
 Discovering tips for participating in meetings
 Getting help and support
W
hen you want advice about something, I say go right to the source. So
I tapped into WebEx’s own customer support reps, and they shared
their most frequently asked customer questions (and answers) with me. And
because I like you, I’m going to share those answers with you.
Many of these questions relate to procedures I’ve covered in more detail else-
where in this book, but because the questions come up so frequently on the
tech support lines, this chapter provides a handy common-problem solution
list. Perhaps one of these items will help you in your learning curve as you
explore all WebEx has to offer.
You can connect with these nice folks yourself by going to www.webex.com
and choosing Customer Care➪Technical Support.
How Do I Share a Presentation 
or Document?
First things first: You have to have started a meeting or session of some sort
(such as a training session) to do this. Then, from within your meeting
window, choose Share➪Presentation or Document. An Open dialog box is 
displayed; select the file you want to share and click Open.

See Chapter 8 for more about sharing things with others during a meeting.
Where Can I Locate WebEx 
Security Information?
Enter this URL in your browser to go to the WebEx Knowledge Base: http://
kb.webex.com. Enter the term “security” in the search box and click the
Search button. Then just click the link for the topic you’re interested in to 
display information about that topic.
If you need help with security questions, call Technical Support at
1-866-229-3239 and choose Option 4. To find international support numbers,
go to www.webex.com/customercare/phone-numbers.html.
How Do I Join a Meeting?
You can join two types of WebEx meetings: listed and unlisted. A listed meeting
appears on the public meeting calendar. An unlisted meeting (logically enough)
doesn’t.
To join a listed meeting, follow these steps:
1. Go to the WebEx URL provided by the meeting host (usually 
company_name.webex.com).
2. Click the Join link next to the meeting you want to join.
3. Enter your name, e-mail address, and password, if the host 
assigned one.
4. Click OK.
You’ll now be connected.
If there is no Join link next to your meeting, it could be because you’re too
early and the meeting hasn’t started. Click the Refresh button on your browser
to check again in a minute or two. Be sure you’ve got the time zone for the
meeting time right; there is time zone information near the top of the meeting
listing page. Finally, if you’ve been clicking Refresh for what seems like hours,
you might just want to call the meeting host and make sure the meeting
hasn’t been cancelled.
260
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

To join an unlisted meeting, follow these steps:
1. Go to the WebEx URL provided by the host.
2. On the left side of the Navigation bar, click the Unlisted link.
3. Enter the meeting number, which is required to join an unlisted 
meeting. (Your host should provide this to you.)
4. Enter your name, e-mail address, and password, if any.
5. Click OK.
You are now connected.
Read more about joining and participating in meetings in Chapter 8.
How Do I Share Remote 
Control of My Desktop?
Sharing control of your desktop is a great way to provide technical support
for a software product or to let your customer view a graphic, animated
demo, or document on your computer.
First you have to start a meeting, session, or event. Then follow these steps
to share your desktop:
1. Choose Share➪Desktop.
2. Select a user you want to share control with.
3. Click OK.
You can read more details about working within a shared desktop in Chapter 7.
How Do I Distribute a 
WebEx Recording File?
When you record a WebEx meeting or presentation, it’s saved in WebEx
Recording File (.wrf) format. You have a few options for saving or sending
these files to others. You can save the file, along with the WebEx Player, which
is required in order to play .wrf files, on a CD, or send the file by e-mail.
261
Chapter 15: Top Nine Frequently Asked Questions from WebEx Tech Support

To send a .wrf file to CD, first download the WebEx Player from your WebEx
site by choosing Support and scrolling to the Record/Playback section of the
page. Add the .wrf files and player executable file to your CD.
To send a .wrf file by e-mail, follow these steps:
1. Create a new e-mail and include in the body the message that recipi-
ents will have to install the WebEx Player to view the files.
2. Include a link to the WebEx Player on your company’s WebEx site so
the recipients can go there to download it.
3. Using the Attach feature of your e-mail program, attach the .wrf files.
The link to download the WebEx Player typically looks something like this:
company_name.webex.com/client/latest/atplay.exe.
How Do I Invite Attendees from 
within a WebEx Meeting?
Sometimes you’re in the middle of a meeting and you realize Bob
Whatshisname from Accounting really should have been invited. What 
to do? Invite him. You can do it during a meeting easily by following 
these steps:
1. Choose Participant➪Invite.
2. Select the By E-mail option.
3. Enter the invitee’s e-mail address in the dialog box that appears and
click the Send Invitation button.
Can I Start a Meeting before the
Scheduled Start Time?
This one’s easy, but apparently the question occurs to folks frequently
enough that technical support would like you to know the answer. Yes, a host
can start a meeting at any time before the scheduled start time. There are
two possibilities here:
262
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 If starting the meeting a significant amount of time before the scheduled
start time, for example the day before or an hour before, once the host
starts the meeting, only then will attendees have the option to join it.
Basically it’s like the host unlocking the meeting room door prior to the
meeting for attendees to enter on their own accord.
 If the host has allowed people to join, say, 15 minutes ahead of the
scheduled start time in setting the meeting up, people can join early, 
but no earlier than the time increment the host has designated (in this
example, 15 minutes before schedule start time).
Why Did My Connection Get Interrupted?
WebEx provides a really reliable connection thanks to the WebEx MediaTone
network, so you might have to take the blame if you lost a connection. Doing
any of these things could interrupt your connection:
 Refreshing the Web page
 Typing in another URL
 Clicking the Back or Forward buttons
The bad news: If you do one of these actions and your connection is lost,
you’ll have to close all open browser windows and join the meeting all over
again. The good news: This only takes a minute or so to do.
What Is the Difference between a Call 
In and Call Out Teleconference?
Essentially, getting involved in a teleconference can happen in a couple of
ways. A participant can call a number to access an online meeting, or the
WebEx service can call out to attendees to hook them up with the meeting.
The host makes this choice when scheduling a meeting. (Chapter 8 covers
the various ways to get connected to a meeting.)

Ten Ideas for Small Businesses
to Maximize Success
In This Chapter
 Exploring how to become more productive with WebEx
 Growing your business with WebEx’s help
 Maximizing your resources with WebEx
S
ome would say that small businesses are the backbone of our economy.
Mom and pop stores of yesteryear have become Joe and Charlene start-
ups. Startups have a way of growing and changing all the time. (Think Bill
Gates in his garage, or Mary Kay at her kitchen table.)
If you’re running a small business, you have your own unique needs. What
kinds of needs? Well, for one thing, everybody who works for you wears so
many hats you probably have a ten-tiered hat stand in every office. Money is
not exactly growing on trees in your reception area. And you can’t wait years
for sales to close. (Stop me if this sounds familiar.)
In this chapter, I take a look at some of the ways that any small business can
take advantage of WebEx to raise productivity, become more efficient, and
save money.
Start Sharing!
If you work for a small business, you have to share things. You share the 
stapler, the coffee-making duties, and the three phone lines. So the sharing
capabilities of WebEx are a natural fit for you.

Here are just a few ways WebEx can help you share things to help you save
money:
 Maximize software spending with shared applications. For example, if
you want to see what your staff thinks of an application you’re consider-
ing buying, let them play around with it in an online environment before
you buy multiple copies.
 Save on overnight charges by finding other ways to share documents.
You don’t have to make ten copies of your budget before the meeting.
Share the budget document file during the online meeting and save the
copy costs.
 Share your desktop to demonstrate a new process. It’s quick and easy
training that saves you from having to go to each person’s desk and
teach him or her the latest scheduler or e-mail client.
Grow Beyond Your Office
Three cubicles, a reception area, and two manager’s offices in an industrial
park in Oshkosh may be a fine place to work, but to grow beyond your own
office walls you need a way to connect with the world at large. Here’s how
WebEx helps you do that:
 Global reach: Even a small business can land a client with an office in
England or Rome. To communicate with international offices via tradi-
tional phone services is cost prohibitive. To connect via e-mail is too
impersonal. Use WebEx video playback or video conferencing features to
make more direct connections and stay competitive with the big guys
who have in-house video-conferencing facilities or huge travel budgets.
 Collaborate more powerfully than you can with a conference call:
Let’s face it: There are limitations to conference calls. You can’t dazzle
customers with multimedia presentations, share documents, or even see
their reactions to your presentation. Using WebEx, you can incorporate
rich media presentations, file sharing, and even inexpensive video into
your meetings.
David and Goliath: You 
versus the Competition
Your greatest competitor is three times bigger than you. You’re sick of walk-
ing away from sales pitch meetings with the sinking feeling that you’ve been
266
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

sideswiped by that competitor because it is able to offer a glitzier sales pre-
sentation, even though you know you can beat its pants off when it comes to
your product or service. What to do?
In a word, WebEx. With WebEx, you can
 Meet with customers more often, ensuring that they never forget who
you are, what you can offer, and how service-oriented you are
 Solve problems instantly to retain hard-won customers
 Provide world-class support and training with a small investment
Start Where You Want, 
Grow When You’re Ready
What you do with WebEx is up to you. The ability to start with a few Pay-
Per-Use meetings, then move to a simple WebEx Express package or a small
business package, and then finally to grow into a tailored solution is a power-
ful tool. If you land a huge contract and experience astronomical growth
leaps, WebEx will be there to help you make those leaps successfully.
As a Web-based service, WebEx saves you the investment in hardware or 
software that other options require.
IT Guy . . . What IT Guy?
Large companies have IT staffs. Small businesses often don’t have much
more than an assistant who is pretty good with computers (mostly because
he lives on computer games when he’s not at work). If this sounds like you,
you’ll be glad to hear that WebEx comes with a staff of people who are there
to ensure you have productive online meetings. Meeting Center Assists,
which provide a live helper to get you through your learning curve, help you
get comfortable right off the bat.
And WebEx’s easy-to-use interface and online documentation and training
provide your folks with all they need to be successful with WebEx.
267
Chapter 16: Ten Ideas for Small Businesses to Maximize Success

Small Business Packages 
for Added Value
WebEx recognizes that small businesses are a large part of its customer base.
That’s why it offers specially tailored small-business packages that help you
succeed. Here are the two small business packages offered as of this writing
(but be sure to check the latest offerings when you’re ready to shop WebEx):
 The Small Business Value Package: This package was designed to help
you increase the number of leads you get and to help you grow your
business. It includes
• WebEx Meeting Center for interactive meetings
• WebEx Event Center
• WebEx Meeting Assist to provide hand-holding support while
you’re learning your way around online meetings
• Production Services to monitor your online event and provide real-
time assistance
• Integrated Audio Conferencing
 The Small Business Premium Package: This includes everything in the
Value Package, plus
• The WebEx Sales Center for high-quality sales demos and presenta-
tions
• WebEx Training Center, which offers a dynamic virtual training
classroom
• WebEx Support Center for remote online support service
Travel Budget? Ha!
Your competition has a dedicated phone line to its travel agency, as well as
massive corporate discounts. You access an online discount travel service
that you pray will give you an airfare to Detroit under $10,000 when you have
to get to your customer’s site with only a day’s notice.
If the words “travel budget” cause your accountant to react with a serious
twitch, relax. Using WebEx means that you can save on travel costs for sales
calls, product demos, customer training, problem solving, and just about any-
thing else you can think of. Just do them all online!
268
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Looking Like the Big Guys
Napoleon didn’t let size hold him back; neither should you. If you’re currently
small, but think big, you can use WebEx to do things that make your company
look bigger and totally professional, such as
 Professional-looking seminars to boost sales: Give potential customers
information and training to educate them about why your service or
product is useful and you’ve won half the sales battle.
 Customer training and support: You may not have a huge customer 
support or training organization, but does your customer have to know
that? Of course not! Deliver training and support via WebEx and you’ve
got all the tools the huge competitors have, at a fraction of the cost.
 Snazzy presentations: You could e-mail a PowerPoint presentation to
your customer, but how much more effective would it be to host an
online presentation, annotating the presentation as you go, allowing
your customer to ask questions and get answers right then, and sharing
documents? Cool, huh?
 Product demos: Why limit yourself to simple canned demos? Let your
customers play around with your desktop or applications. And you don’t
even have to travel to their offices — just set up a session through Sales
Center, and that’s it!
Many Hats, Many Training Dollars
When your business is small, everyone wears a lot of hats, so you have to
train each employee in more than one role. Trust me, this can get expensive.
Ease the cost of this training by using WebEx. You can provide self-paced or
instructor-led training to help new employees get up to speed on company
procedures, or train folks to use new software you’ve adopted or learn how
to use a new selling system that will help you defeat the competition.
Oops . . . We Slowed Down
It happens: You lose a big contract, your industry or the economy slows
down, and a small business sometimes can’t support all its costs in lean
times as a large business is able to.
269
Chapter 16: Ten Ideas for Small Businesses to Maximize Success

WebEx gives you the flexibility to move to a smaller package when you need
to, and then shift to one with more features when things get going again. Just
keep in mind that most packages have a three-month minimum, but if you ful-
fill that, WebEx can help you make changes to accommodate both your growth
and the lean times.

ebEx doesn’t offer a one size fits all approach to Web-based interac-
tion. In fact, WebEx provides a pretty customizable suite of Web-based
meeting solutions, which means that the combination of applications you
purchase and the way you use them in your business can vary. Some compa-
nies go for every bell and whistle, some get big results from implementing
just a meeting and training solution, or a support or sales solution. (Of course
the beauty of all this flexibility is that whatever combination you choose, it’s
easy and fast to deploy because all your people need is a browser and Internet
connection).
In this chapter I give you a glimpse of the many ways that real world compa-
nies (small and large) are using WebEx applications. I hope that these case
studies give you ideas for how best to implement WebEx in your organization.
Then you can take those ideas and talk to your WebEx account manager to
discuss the best options for your needs.

StratX Jumps on the Remote 
Learning Bandwagon
StratX is a global marketing and strategy development consultancy that helps
Fortune 500 companies design and deploy simulation based, interactive semi-
nars. Two years ago the business decided to expand its use of computerized
conferencing systems, specifically to enhance it’s e-learning offerings.
However they had clients who were cautious about allowing them to install
applications on their computer systems.
They took a look at WebEx and liked what they saw. “It’s a light program on
the client side, it takes minutes to set up, and it’s very firewall friendly,” says
StratX’s director of e-learning solutions, Delphone Parmenter. StatX takes
advantage of the capacity to share documents, software applications, and a
whiteboard in real time to teach market-focused strategies to classes of indi-
viduals in remote locations. They use various WebEx tools such as polling to
interact with and keep the attention of attendees. They even customized
their online classroom to provide access to their computerized business
games and to make the environment more intuitive for their users.
The results? The total number of StratX customer being taught online has
moved up from 200 to 600 in the last year. And, the percentage of people who
complete the courses has soared from only 70 percent, to an impressive 92.5
percent.
Iowa Foundation for Medical 
Care Increases Productivity
With over 500 employees, the IFMC works with government agencies and
healthcare providers in all 50 states to improve the quality of medical care.
With seven offices of their own and three major divisions, they were chal-
lenged to provide their contingency with quality support for processing of
Medicare and Medicaid benefits.
An important part of the foundation’s requirements was the need to comply
with security requirements of federal reporting agencies. WebEx’s offerings
supported SSL encryption, support for all firewalls, and security features 
that were important in a medical reporting setting. Now IFMC uses WebEx
Training Center to deliver training, Meeting Center to hold online meetings,
and assist their Help Desk staff via Support Center. Using Support Center, for
example, they can observe clients entering information into their software
and see where mistakes are occurring.

Epicor Beefs Up Customer Support
Epicor is in the business of delivering integrated enterprise software for mid-
sized companies. They needed a way to share and use the users’ screens and
use remote control to diagnose, troubleshoot, and resolve issues with their
software at client sites from a distance.
Epicor had already implemented WebEx Meeting Center in their sales organi-
zation. When they added Support Center to their operations, they found that
they reduced customer call resolution times by 50% or more. In certain cases
issues that were taking 4 hours to resolve were now resolved in 30 minutes or
less. In just one support center they experienced savings of 100 call time
hours a month.
Epicor also uses WebEx to remotely implement customized software solutions
for customers, saving time and money in travel costs. 
CHT R. Beitlich Gets Technical 
Support Going
This German textile manufacturer has operations in approximately 50 coun-
tries. Their challenge was to provide their satellite offices with technical 
support and maintenance. Support Center allows them to provide real time
diagnoses and resolution of problems over the Internet. Instant sessions,
remote patch downloads, and interactive desktop sharing have proved to 
be most valuable tools in supporting their offices. They can even do entire
systems installations at remote sites without ever traveling there.
DSM Cuts Travel Costs 
and Time to Market
No stranger to international operations, DSM is a global leader in the chemi-
cals industry with 200 offices and 40 production sites worldwide. The cost
and time involved with collaborating via physical meetings was taking its toll
on DSM.
As part of the chemical/pharmaceutical industry, DSM was especially con-
cerned with security. The security features offered by SSL and the WebEx
Mediatone Network, where a client’s information is never stored but switched
in real time, were very attractive to this kind of company. Also, interactive
features such as sharing documents and applications proved useful. 
273
Chapter 17: Ten Ways That Companies Get the Most Out of WebEx

DSM has even integrated the WebEx Meeting Center service with its calendar-
ing program, allowing users to schedule and attend meetings from within
their calendars.
The result of this improved collaboration has been savings in time, money,
and faster cycles to get product to market.
Emory University Saves 
Busy Students Time
Emory University serves some 11,000+ students. To help these students be
the most productive they implemented WebEx Training Center, creating vir-
tual classrooms students could log into from their home PC. 
The Whiteboard feature provided handy for discussions of case studies and
strategies. PowerPoint presentations with annotation capabilities enhances
teacher-student interaction. Student study teams also use WebEx features to
collaborate on projects. 
Faculty have even instituted virtual office hours, where students can stop by
and talk without having to hike across campus or across town. An added ben-
efit is the ability of faculty to network with colleagues around the world, even
inviting other academic experts to participate in virtual classroom sessions.
InfoGenesis Gets Smart with SMARTtech
When your focus is on hospital information technology, your efficiency can
be a matter of life and death. InfoGenesis provides software, hardware, instal-
lation, and training to the hospital and food services industries. Providing
great customer support is a key concern of the company. They need to con-
stantly provide updates, patches, and refinements to their customers.
InfoGenesis also had a need to make connections between its data center and
customers over Virtual Private Networks. With other online remote access
solutions direct network connections were required that were impossible to
achieve with VPNs. The seamless connection provided by WebEx through
any firewall was an elegant answer to this challenge.
WebEx’s SMARTtech remote access technology was the solution InfoGenesis
needed. They use a third party software to manage downloads of patches 
274

and updates to customers. Technicians can use WebEx sessions to access a
remote system and take remote control to view log files and use SMARTtech
technology to transfer files between systems.
Mindspeed Lowers the 
Cost of Sales Training
Mindspeed provides semiconductor networking solutions, which they work
with some of the movers and shakers in the wireless industry as well as
others. Mindspeed’s sales reps and channel partners are located around the
globe. When new products launch they have to provide rapid, cost-effective
training on semiconductor-related issues, which, trust me, is pretty complex
technology.
Videoconferencing services just cost too much to make them practical. Enter
WebEx. Mindspeed’s strategy is now to hold weekly updates, rather than
inundating salespeople and channel partners with a day or two of training
every few months. This has worked well, because people get the information
in smaller chunks, and are not overwhelmed by the technology. This small
chunk of training model also means salespeople spend less time off the road,
and more time out there selling. The result is that Mindspeed has reduced its
training delivery costs by 96 percent.
But training isn’t the only use MindSpeed has for WebEx applications. Their
product designers in diversely located design centers brainstorm and collab-
orate on shared designs online. Because of WebEx, sharing large-scale
schematics has become easy to do.
Fidelity Trains over 5,000 People
Fidelity Information Services is a division of Fidelity National Financial. They
have clients in more than 50 countries to whom they provide application soft-
ware, information processing management, and outsourcing services for the
financial services industry. 
With over 5,000 staff members to train worldwide, Fidelity’s training group
needed a cost-effective solution to training. Though they had used various
online training solutions in the past, they found that WebEx Training Center
worked better with their Learning Content Management System (LCMS). They
got the flexibility to use all the training content tools they had in place, and
the bandwidth to deliver them through WebEx.

Chapter 17: Ten Ways That Companies Get the Most Out of WebEx

Air Liquide Keeps Employees 
Off the Road
Air Liquide leads the pack when it comes to industrial and medical gases.
Next time you get oxygen when you’re in the hospital, there’s a good chance
these folks supplied it. 
So, what were their meeting challenges? With 30,800 employees located in
more than 65 countries you can imagine the communication challenges. Add
to that a decentralized model that allows each subsidiary a certain amount 
of autonomy, a proliferation of collaboration tools resulted. As this became
more and more unwieldy, Air Liquide management looked for a more unified
solution.
What tipped the balance in this situation were the incidents of September 11,
2001. International travel now became more than an inconvenience, it became
fraught with difficulties and actual danger. The company made the leap to
meeting with WebEx. The result was increased interaction among teams, 
savings of travel time and costs, and added safety for employees who no
longer had to be on the road to physical meetings.
And, because all a user needs is a Web browser to access WebEx meetings,
they could extend the communication channel to individuals outside the
company, including suppliers, customers, and consultants.

I see that you support Mozilla; can I use Mozilla’s Firefox browser?
Although not officially supported by WebEx at this time, Mozilla users can
use Firefox to join and host an event. 
How come I can’t join a meeting with Mozilla browser, when it’s supposed
to be supported?
279
Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions

If you are using Mozilla as your browser on a UNIX based operating system
such as Solaris or Linux or Apple’s Mac OS X platform, you have to make sure
that the Java plug-in is installed on your workstation. Mozilla does not ship
with the Java Plug-In by default on these platforms. The following Web sites
provide instructions for their individual operating systems:
 Linux: http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/linux.html#Java
 Solaris: http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/solaris.html#Java
 Mac OS X: http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/OSX.html#Java
On UNIX-based systems, you have to use a symbolic link (if you don’t know
what this is, ask your administrator). The example below is based on a Red
Hat Linux environment: 
$ cd /usr/local/mozilla/plugins
$ ln –s /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_04/plugin/i386/ns610-gcc32/libjavaplugin_oji.so
libjavaplugin_oji.so 
I really like the new look and features of WebEx, how come I don’t have
any of the new floating panels and new color themes from my Mac, Linux
or Solaris machine?
The new user interface you see on a Windows platform contains WebEx’s
newest set of improvements based on user experience. Currently, the new
look and feel, as well as new features, is not available on any other operating
system. However, users on non-Windows operating systems can still host and
attend the same events as their Windows counterparts. The new look and 
features are being planned for Mac, Solaris and Linux operating systems in a
future release. (If you buy this book a year or so after the lastest WebEx inter-
face is released, these products may all be available and you won’t even have
to ask this question!).
Is branding available for Event Center Web sites?
Yes, if you purchase a Subscription service. Talk to your account manager to
discover more about this.
What does the Event Center Production Services offer?
The Event Center Production Services is a team of experts who help you pro-
duce your Web-based events — from start to finish. Production Services 
provides the following:
 Design and setup for your event
 Management of all technical aspects of your event
 Event rehearsals and dry-runs 
 Training and coaching to presenters 
280
WebEx Web Meetings For Dummies 

 Consultation on preparing presentations and conducting effective events 
 Technical support before and during an event 
 Event recordings 
 Recorded event archives for up to 90 days 
 Coordination and set up of teleconferencing services 
 Generation of follow-up reports after an event 
What are public, private, and unlisted events?
When scheduling an event, you can specify the event to be public, private, or
unlisted. Here’s how these break down:
 Public event — Appears on the Upcoming Events page and the
Recorded Events page, if the event host makes the recording public. 
On the Upcoming Events page, an Enroll button appears for the event
until the host starts the event. 
 Private event — Appears on the Upcoming Events page and the
Recorded Events page, if the event host makes the recording public. 
On the Upcoming Events page, the text Private appears instead of an
Enroll button. Once you’re within 15 minutes of the event’s scheduled
starting time, and the host starts the event, a Join button appears. 
 Unlisted event — Does not appear on the Upcoming Events page.
However, it appears on the Recorded Events page if the event host
makes the recording public. 
How do I customize email messages for event invitees, enrollees and 
attendees?
When you schedule an event, you can customize any of the email messages
that Event Center sends to event invitees, enrollees and attendees. First, on
the Schedule an Event page, select the check box for the email messages that
you want to send:
 Enrollment Pending 
 Enrollment Approved 
 Enrollment Rejected 
 Reminder 
 Thank You for Attending 
 Absentee Follow-up 
Next, click the link for the email message to open the Edit Email Message
window.
281
Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions

When customizing the content of an email message, you can use several vari-
ables, which Event Center automatically replaces with information about the
event when sending the message. For example, you can use the variable
%Topic%, which Event Center automatically replaces with the event name
specified on the Schedule an Event page. You can also restore an email tem-
plate by clicking the Restore to Default button.
I already started the event, but attendees do not see the Join button on the
Upcoming Events page. Why?
If you haven’t enabled the join-before-host feature for an event, then the Join
button appears on the Upcoming Event page only if both of the following 
are true:
 The event host has already started the event. 
 The current time is within 15 minutes of the event’s scheduled 
starting time. 
How many attendees can Event Center accommodate?
Event Center is developed based on a highly scalable platform. Event Center
can accommodate up to 3,000 concurrent attendees in a single event for 
document sharing. When application sharing is used in an event, the recom-
mended event size is 1,000 concurrent attendees.
Can an event be recorded?
Yes. Using WebEx Recorder, subscription customers can record their own
events, or the Event Center Production Team can record events for customers.
Recorded events can be published on an Event Center Web site, where others
can play them. 
What is the recommended size for a VoIP event?
WebEx recommends keeping a VoIP event to less than 500 attendees with the
following activities: document sharing, chat, and Q&A. You should minimize
application-sharing usage when you’re running a VoIP event.
What are WebEx teleconferencing offerings?
WebEx offers several types of teleconferencing services: Toll, and toll-free
reservation-less or operator-assisted.
What is WebEx reservation-less teleconferencing, and when should I use it?
Reservation-less teleconferencing is on-demand teleconferencing, which you
can schedule using the Schedule an Event page. With reservation-less, you
282
WebEx Web Meetings For Dummies 

can optionally choose to prompt attendees for their phone number and the
system will call them back. This option is appropriate for events with fewer
than 125 participants for which you don’t need:
 Operator assistance 
 *0 option for question-and-answer (Q & A) sessions 
 Side conferences or sub-conferencing to allow the presentation team
preparation or technical support time 
WebEx recommends reservation-less teleconferencing for:
 Dry runs 
 Practice sessions 
 Smaller, less formal events for which you do don’t need 
the help of an operator
How do I get WebEx reservation-less teleconferencing?
You can contact your Client Service manager to enable this service on 
your site.
What is WebEx operator-assisted teleconferencing, and when should I use it?
You must schedule a WebEx operator-assisted teleconference before the
event’s starting time. An operator-assisted teleconference provides the 
following features:
 Operator-assisted audio 
 A *0 option, which participants can dial to speak to an operator 
 Support for side conferences for presentation team preparation or 
technical support 
 Support for online question-and-answer (Q & A) sessions 
I recommend operator-assisted teleconferencing for events with more than
125 participants when you need formal and personalized service.
How do I schedule a WebEx operator-assisted teleconference?
To schedule a WebEx operator-assisted teleconference, dial 1-866-389-3239 (toll-
free) or 1-916-851-8501.You can also schedule a teleconference by sending an
email message to the following address: ecproductionservices@webex.com.
Can I use my own teleconferencing vendor?
Yes, you can always use your own teleconferencing service provider for 
your events.

What does WebEx Sales Center do for my sales management?
WebEx Sales Center has the following benefits:
For sales managers, moving from the traditional sales process to the tech-
driven sales process:
284
WebEx Web Meetings For Dummies 

 Makes the sales pipeline more transparent to management
 Allows sales management to have a greater impact 
 Creates an environment that encourages teamwork 
 Reduces the overall cost of the average sale
 Increases average revenue and profit per sale
How does WebEx Sales Center reduce selling costs?
Two of the biggest expenses in sales are prospecting for qualified leads and
making sales calls at customer sites. Fortunately, these are the exact two
areas where WebEx Sales Center can have the most positive financial impact.
 Saving Money on Prospecting: Prospecting gets more expensive every
year. In many sales environments, a successful lead developed from tele-
marketing can cost $15 or more. Magazine advertising can be even more
expensive. Unless advertising is highly targeted to a particular audience,
it’s not unusual for companies to spend up to $100 per qualified lead.
Special sales events can be even pricier. It’s not unusual for a company
to spend $10,000 on a special event, only to end up with ten real
prospects. That’s $1,000 per lead!
With WebEx Sales Center, a sales organization can use online events to
prospect for qualified leads. Such events typically cost a small fraction of
special events at hotels and trade shows, and can be even more effective. 
 Saving Money on Sales Calls: Because WebEx Sales Center reduces the
need for sales-oriented business travel, WebEx Sales Center radically
reduces the cost of closing business. Even without counting travel, it
cost a company an average of $1,000 per sales call to have a sales rep
conduct needs analysis, present a solution, and conduct follow-up activi-
ties. If the customer is located remotely, it can cost an addition $1,000
(on average) in travel expenses per sales call. Since it takes, on average,
four sales call to close a sale, that’s $8,000 that must be spent before a
sale is even made! And that doesn’t count the lost opportunity cost of
business travel. If the average sales rep spends a day every week travel-
ing, it’s the equivalent of paying a “tax” of 20 percent on all sales activities!
WebEx Sales Center completely changes that equation. While the intellec-
tual effort of moving the sale forward remains constant, travel expenses
and lost opportunity costs are minimized. This can have an enormous
impact. If a sales force of 100, for example, uses WebEx Sales Center to
avoid a day of travel per week, that’s the equivalent of adding 20 more
sales reps to the staff – at no extra expense. In addition, at $1,000 a trip,
WebEx Sales Center would be saving a whopping $5 million in travel
expenses (50 weeks*100 reps* $1,000).
Furthermore, conducting online sales calls can give you and your
prospects the flexibility to meet more often, which can significantly
reduce the sales cycle.

How do I schedule meetings using Microsoft Outlook?
You can download the installer from the Support page, and install it. You will
need administrative privileges to install it on Windows NT, 2000, and XP. You
can then use Outlook to schedule WebEx meetings, invite attendees, and start
WebEx meetings. Your invited attendees can easily join the meeting from
their Outlook Calendars.
What happens if I invite people who are not using Outlook or are not in
my organization?
These invitees receive a normal invitation email message, which contains a
link that they can click to join the meeting.
Do I have to download software to host a meeting?
To use all of the interactive features in a meeting, you must run Meeting
Manager on your computer. Meeting Manager lets you or anyone in the meet-
ing share most types of documents or applications. Unlike installing software
from a disk or downloading it over the Internet and installing it manually,
your meeting service automatically downloads and sets up Meeting Manager
for you. Each time you participate in a meeting, Meeting Manager maintains
itself by checking for the latest version and automatically updating itself, as
necessary. 
For first-time users, the Meeting Manager for Windows download is approxi-
mately 1.0 MB. Meeting Manager then downloads updates as appropriate.
Can I use Meeting Manager for Windows if I am a restricted user running
Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Windows XP?
Yes, administrator privileges are not required to install Meeting Manager.
287
Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions

How do I install the fully interactive Meeting Manager manually?

How do I uninstall Meeting Manager?
To uninstall Meeting Manager for Windows, use Add/Remove Programs in the
Control Panel. 
To uninstall Meeting Manager for Mac OS, double-click the installer, then, on
the Easy Install menu, choose Uninstall. 
To uninstall Meeting Manager, run wbxsetup, as described on the WebEx
Support page. Then follow the instructions on your screen to uninstall the
software. 
To uninstall Meeting Manager for Palm, refer to your WebEx site’s Palm
Support page. 
What affects the performance of my online sales calls?
Because WebEx online sales calls provide real-time collaboration and sharing
over the Internet, performance depends on both the Internet itself and the
WebEx service. WebEx constantly monitors service and network performance,
and continually enhances its infrastructure to keep WebEx meeting services
available and reliable.
Some of the factors that affect performance are the following: 
 The speed of your computer’s connection to the Internet 
 The performance of your Internet service provider 
 Overall Internet traffic on your routed connection to the WebEx server 
 Performance of firewall and proxy servers, if your computer is behind a
company firewall 
I have a high-speed Internet connection. Does that help my sales call 
performance?
Although you may have a high-speed connection to the Internet, there can
often be congestion or packet loss (data that is dropped during transmission)
on the Internet, between you and the WebEx servers on the WebEx Interactive
Network. You usually can’t do much about this, other than to inform your net-
work administrator or Internet service provider. Problems are often of short
288
WebEx Web Meetings For Dummies 

duration and resolve themselves over time. However, you should report seri-
ous, persistent problems. Of course, more bandwidth usually allows more
throughput — but not always. For example, a clear 56K modem connection
can perform well, while a congested “high speed” T1 connection can cause
you sleepless nights and significant hair loss. 
Furthermore, a good connection won’t help you if you’re an attendee in a
meeting and the presenter has a poor connection. Thus, it’s most critical 
that the presenter have a connection that’s up to snuff.
What can I do to speed things up?
First, get the fastest connection that you can. ISPs are rapidly deploying DSL,
cable modem, and T1 connections. Dial-up modems can do the job, but any-
thing less than 56K is probably too slow. Even with a 56K modem, your actual
connection speed may vary.
Next, try using document and presentation sharing instead of application or
desktop sharing, because document and presentation sharing uses less band-
width. Also, sharing documents or presentations that contain fewer graphics
can improve the performance.
Also make sure the presenter has a fast connection. It doesn’t help the 
attendees to all have T1 connections if the presenter is on a slow modem
connection.
How can I test performance?
The Trace Route utility on your Windows computer can help you to determine
where problems are occurring between your computer and the WebEx server.
On Windows’ Accessories menu, open a DOS prompt or a Command prompt
window, then type
tracert your_siteURL 
where your_site_URL is the address for your WebEx meeting service Web
site. Be sure that you include a space after tracert. 
When running Trace Route, your computer sends packets of information
across your connection to measure the amount of time it takes to for the pack-
ets to reach the meeting server. Ideally, packets should take between 1-60 ms
to reach the server. If packets take between 60-100 ms to reach the server,
your connection is slow and you’ll feel the consequences in a WebEx meeting.
Times longer than 100 ms are likely to seem unacceptably slow. If you continue
to experience poor performance, ping your network administrator.
289
Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions

What’s the difference between document sharing and application sharing?
Document sharing uses a printer driver (the WebEx Document Loader) to
create an image of your document, which is then presented for review and
markup in the Meeting Manager content viewer. This image is a lot like a
printed document or fax — that is , you can’t edit it, you can just admire it.
This image requires relatively little bandwidth and so it works well at slower
connection speeds.
On the other hand, application sharing sends images of the application in
real-time, allowing you to edit documents as well as show all of an applica-
tion’s features, such as menus and tools. This type of sharing is much more
powerful and requires more bandwidth. 
What types of files or applications can I share?
You can share virtually any document or application. However, applications
with streaming content may not work well, because this kind of content is not
streaming directly from the source to attendees. However, if you want to
share a Web page with streaming content, you can use Web content sharing,
which opens a window on each attendee’s computer and streams the content
directly from its source.
Does everyone in a meeting need the file or application that I want to share?
No. Only the presenter in the meeting must have the file or application on his
or her computer. 
How can I modify documents that I’m sharing?
In document sharing, you can annotate documents, but not edit them,
because the content is an image like you view in a PDF document or fax.
However, you can use application sharing to edit documents as you share
them in a meeting, and save the final version in the native application format
(the format the document was originally created in). Application sharing lets
all the attendees see the changes that you make, or edit the document them-
selves, if you grant them remote control.
Can I share more than one document or presentation at a time?
Yes, you can share as many documents or presentations as you like in the
content viewer. Each document or presentation that you open appears on 
its own tab in the content viewer. Because Meeting Manager automatically
labels each tab with the title or name of the document or presentation, you
can quickly locate the document or presentation that you want to share with
attendees.
290
WebEx Web Meetings For Dummies 

Can I save annotated documents or presentations and view them offline?
In a word, yes. To save any document or presentation in a file on your com-
puter, choose Save on the File menu. To view the saved file offline, simply
double-click it. The document or presentation appears in the WebEx Document
Viewer, which is part of Meeting Manager.
Can I save annotations made during application sharing or desktop sharing?
Yes. To do this, you can record your meeting. A recording captures all annota-
tions and other actions that you make during application or desktop sharing.
Can I show animations and slide transitions in presentations?
Sure. If you share a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation, attendees can see ani-
mations and slide transitions in their content viewers. Alternatively, you can
show animations and slide transitions by using application sharing to share
your slide-authoring application, then open the slides in that application.
What happens if people in a meeting have displays of different sizes or 
resolutions?
In a WebEx meeting, all of the attendees’ views automatically display the
meeting content, even if they have different display resolutions. No matter
which resolution attendees’ monitors are set to, attendees’ views automati-
cally follow the presenter’s mouse pointer. Thus, the presenter should always
keep the mouse pointer near the content under discussion. For best results,
the presenter should set his or her monitor to 800 x 600 pixels, because this
resolution is the most common. To change your monitor’s display resolution
for Windows, use the Settings tab in the Display Control Panel. For Mac OS,
use the Monitors Control Panel.
Why do attendees sometimes see a yellow crosshatched pattern during
application sharing?
The crosshatched pattern is the shadow of a dialog box or window that is in
front of the shared application on the presenter’s screen. Once the presenter
closes this dialog box or window, the pattern disappears.
Can I use my keyboard keys to remotely control an application that is 
running on a different platform?
Yes. If you are remotely controlling a presenter’s application, desktop, or Web
browser and your computer’s operating system is not the same as the pre-
senter’s, Meeting Manager automatically maps your keyboard keys to the 
presenter’s keys. For details, look up “keyboard shortcuts, using to remotely
control software” in the Index in the online Help for your WebEx meeting 
service Web site.

Why can’t I bookmark some pages on my WebEx meeting service Web site?
Your meeting service Web site dynamically generates many of its pages, which
you cannot bookmark. Therefore, you can only bookmark your home page.
How can I prevent uninvited attendees from joining my meeting?
The following are several ways that you can prevent uninvited attendees
from joining your meeting: 
292
WebEx Web Meetings For Dummies 

 Specify a password for your meeting. Your meeting service automatically
includes the password for your meeting in an invitation email message
to each invited attendee. 
 Schedule an unlisted meeting. On the Schedule a Meeting page, you can
select the Unlisted meeting check box to prevent your meeting from
appearing on the meeting calendar. Only attendees who have the meeting
number can join the meeting.
 Restrict access to your meeting. Once all invited attendees have joined
the meeting, you can choose Restrict Access on the Meeting menu to
prevent others from joining the meeting.
 Expel any uninvited attendee from your meeting, by choosing Expel on
the Participant menu.
Why don’t email notifications show the meeting time in the attendee’s 
time zone?
In email notifications, Meeting times automatically appear in the host’s time
zone. A host can change his or her time zone on the Preferences page.
Although your meeting service can’t figure out each attendee’s time zone and
adjust it automatically for each email notification, attendees can easily view
meeting times in their time zones on your meeting service Web site by select-
ing a different time zone on the Preferences page.

Citrix include:
 Platforms supported: Windows XP SP1 and Windows 2000 SP4 
 Browsers supported: Internet Explorer 5 or higher, Mozilla 1.4.1 or
higher, Netscape 4.7 or higher 
How come I can’t join a Support Session with Mozilla browser, when it’s
supposed to be supported? 
If you are using Mozilla as your browser on a UNIX based operating system
such as Solaris or Linux or Apple’s Mac OS X platform, you will need to 
make sure that the Java plug-in is installed on your workstation. Mozilla 
does not ship with the Java Plug-In by default on these platforms. The follow-
ing web sites provide instructions for the associated operating system: 
 Linux: http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/linux.html#Java
 Solaris: http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/solaris.html#Java
 Mac OS X: http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/OSX.html#Java
On UNIX based systems, there is a symbolic link that is required. The example
below is based on a Red Hat Linux environment: 
$ cd /usr/local/mozilla/plugins
$ ln –s /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_04/plugin/i386/ns610-gcc32/libjavaplugin_oji.so
libjavaplugin_oji.so
How come I don’t have any of the floating panels and new color themes
from my Mac, Linux or Solaris machine? 
The latest WebEx user interface you see on a Windows platform contains
WebEx’s newest set of user experience improvements. As of this writing, the
new look and feel as well as new features, is not available on any other oper-
ating system. However, users on non-Windows operating systems can still
host and attend the same meetings as their Windows counterparts. The new
look and features are being planned for Mac, Solaris, and Linux operating sys-
tems in a future release.
295
Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions

Do I have to download software to start a support session?
WebEx Support Center service automatically downloads and sets up Support
Manager for you. In fact, each time you start a support session, Support Man-
ager saves you the trouble and maintains itself by checking for the latest ver-
sion and automatically updating itself, as necessary. 
For first-time users, the Support Manager for Windows download is approxi-
mately 2.5 MB. Support Manager subsequently downloads only updated com-
ponents as needed.
Can I use Support Manager for Windows if I am a non-administrative
Windows NT, Windows 2000 or Windows XP user?
Yes, administrator privileges are not required to install Support Manager.
How do I uninstall Support Manager?
To uninstall Support Manager for Windows, use Add/Remove Programs in the
Control Panel. 
As a customer attending the Support session are there any cool hot keys
available to me?
Hot keys available to you are as follows:
 Ctrl + F10 = leave session
 Ctrl + F8 = start Chat session
 Ctrl + F3 = close chat window
 Ctrl + F7 = close file transfer
 Ctrl + F9 = close Application/Desktop sharing window
 Ctrl+Shift+F3 = focus on chat window
What affects the performance of support sessions?
Because WebEx support sessions provide real-time collaboration over the
Internet, performance depends on both the Internet itself and the WebEx 
service. WebEx constantly monitors service and network performance, and
continually enhances its infrastructure to keep WebEx meeting services 
available and reliable.
Some of the factors that affect performance are the following: 
296
WebEx Web Meetings For Dummies 

 the speed of your computer’s connection to the Internet 
 the performance of your Internet service provider 
 overall Internet traffic on your routed connection to the WebEx server 
 performance of firewall and proxy servers, if your computer is behind a
company firewall 
I have a high-speed Internet connection. Does that help?
Although you may have a high-speed connection to the Internet, there can
often be congestion or packet loss on the Internet, between you and the
WebEx servers on the WebEx Interactive Network. Much as you’d like to, you
usually can’t do much about this, other than to inform your network adminis-
trator or Internet service provider. Problems are often temporary and work
themselves out over time. However, you should report serious, persistent
problems. Of course, more bandwidth usually allows more throughput — but
not always. For example, a clear 56K modem connection can perform well,
while a congested “high speed” T1 connection can ruin your whole day.
How can I test performance?
The Trace Route utility on your computer can help you to determine where
problems are occurring between your computer and the WebEx server. On
the Windows Accessories menu, open a DOS prompt or a Command prompt
window, then type
tracert your_site_URL 
where your_site_URL is the address for your meeting service Web site.
Ensure that you include a space after tracert. 
When running Trace Route, your computer sends packets of information
across your connection to measure the amount of time it takes to for the
packets to reach the meeting server. Ideally, packets should take between
1-60 ms to reach the server. If packets take between 60-100 ms to reach 
the server, your connection is slow and may be noticeable in a WebEx meet-
ing. Times longer than 100 ms are likely to seem unacceptably slow. If you
continue to experience poor performance, give a shout to your network
administrator.
What types of applications can I view or control?
You can view or control virtually any application running on a customer’s
computer.
297
Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions

Do I need to have the application that I want to view or control?
No, the application that you want to view or control does not need to be
installed on your computer.
Sometimes images of a customer’s desktop or application don’t look so
good. Why?
You may see degradation in the quality of some images as the WebEx com-
pression algorithm scurries to automatically compensate for slow connections.
What happens if a customer has a display of a different size or resolution?
In a support session, Support Manager automatically displays the customer’s
desktop or application, even if the customer’s monitor is set to a different dis-
play resolution. For best results, however, you should set your monitor to 800
x 600 pixels, because this resolution is the most common. To change your
monitor’s display resolution for Windows, use the Settings tab in the Display
Control Panel.
Why do I sometimes see a yellow crosshatched pattern when viewing or
controlling a customer’s application?
The crosshatched pattern is the shadow of a dialog box or window that is in
front of the shared application on the customer’s screen. Once the customer
closes this dialog box or window, the pattern goes away.
Which video cameras are supported?
You can generally use any video camera, or webcam, that connects to either
a USB or parallel port on your computer. 
WebEx has tested the following video cameras for Windows and found them
to be compatible with Support Manager for Windows:
 3Com Home Connect 
 Creative Lab PD0040 
 Creative webcam plus 
 D-Link WebCam 
 Epson type SW 
 EZonics EZCam USB 
 IBM PC Camera ( Black) 
 IBM PC Camera Pro (White) 
 iBOT FireWire Desktop

 Logitech QuickCam VC (Parallel) 
 Omiga CD370 Camera 
 Video Camera (1394) 
 Vista Imaging Vi Cam LPT 
 Vista Imaging Vi Cam USB 
Why can’t I bookmark some pages on my Support Center Web site?
Your Support Center Web site dynamically generates many of its pages, which
you cannot bookmark. You can therefore bookmark only the home page.
