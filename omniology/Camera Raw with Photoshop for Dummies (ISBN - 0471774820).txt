Dedication
For my wonderful wife, Amy, who has supported me all along in my new endeav-
ors, and our children Amanda, Emily, and David. You have all supported me
through this project, and helped me make it happen. Thanks for taking such
good care of me while I spent all those days and evenings writing, taking naps,
taking photos, and messing around with Photoshop. I love you all!
Author’s Acknowledgments
Putting a book together is a large effort, and the author isn’t the only one who
spends a lot of time and dedication moving it toward completion. I have many
people to thank for their hard work and dedication to this project. I especially
want to thank Laura Lewin from Studio B and Bob Woerner at Wiley for giving
me this opportunity. You are both a pleasure to work with, and I especially
appreciate your professionalism.
I would like to personally acknowledge my Project Editor Nicole Sholly, who
gave me tremendous support on a daily basis to help me through all the intri-
cacies of writing a technical manuscript, plus helping me keep on schedule
and always being available at any time when I needed some help.
I would like to acknowledge the copyediting work of Barry Childs-Helton.
Barry’s eloquent suggestions for tweaks to my otherwise-plain language have
helped me take my writing to a new level. Barry worked extremely hard making
sure words weren’t a tangled mess, explanations were understandable, and
humor was on--target. I think Barry worked as hard on this book as I did, and
I am very grateful for the effort.
Any technical book, especially one written about complex software
like Photoshop, needs a great technical editor. My special thanks to Ron
Rockwell — whom I rely on to advise me about technical issues, offer great
alternatives, and help keep my techniques correct. It’s professionals like
Nicole, Barry, and Ron that make the editing process fun and productive.
I would also like to acknowledge the rest of the team at Wiley who get things
done behind the scenes, including Kevin Kirschner and Amanda Foxworth.
Thank you all for your efforts to make sure my writing, images, and ﬁgures
are all formatted, arranged correctly, and understandable.

Camera Raw with Photoshop For Dummies 

Introduction
D
igital photography has come a long way in the last few years. When digi-
tal cameras broke the 3-megapixel barrier, I strongly considered jumping
in and retiring my film gear. By the time 5-megapixel digital cameras hit the
street, I was hooked. Then, just a few years ago, the raw file format started
being offered, and Adobe Camera Raw was born. To me, this was digital
heaven — to have full control over how digital images are processed, from
camera all the way to print.
If you’re shooting raw now, you’ve probably figured out the advantages of
working in that format. Being able to correct image exposure and white bal-
ance is enough to sell me, but you can also make overall adjustments in color
and tone without the danger of destroying valuable image data — and that’s
the biggest gift the format gives us. Camera Raw ties the process together, let-
ting photographers bypass using third-party software so we can process raw
files within the same software we use to edit our photos.
This book gives you a detailed explanation of the entire end-to-end process —
from capturing raw images with your digital camera to organizing your files in
Bridge, converting your images in Adobe Camera Raw, and then processing
them in Photoshop. I explain each individual procedure as a workflow — a set
of useful habits to develop in sequence. Okay, sure, the term has been a buzz-
word in photography trade rags over the past few years, but truly this concept
is the path toward more consistent processes for getting your images from
camera to print — resulting in more consistent quality. Your photography will
improve just by following the steps provided in this book as you develop your
workflows.
About This Book
I’ve spent the past few years perfecting my processes with Photoshop —
which can be a very intimidating software program. The last few versions
offered even more capability to master — the File Browser, the new Bridge pro-
gram, and Camera Raw, now in its third or fourth version. This book gives me
the opportunity to share that knowledge with photographers who shoot in raw
format and want to get up to speed with these new Photoshop capabilities.

2
Camera Raw with Photoshop For Dummies 
I’ve selected the content of this book based on what’s most important to us
as photographers. The chapters are also organized in a manner in which we
use parts of Photoshop according to order, or in an overall workflow. Some of
these topics include
 The importance of and implementing color management.
 The importance of and implementing workflows. 
 Using Bridge and managing digital images.
 Understanding color.
 Using Camera Raw.
 Making overall color and tonal corrections in Photoshop.
 Making edits in Photoshop.
Mastering the skills in these areas of Photoshop and digital photography will
help you organize and streamline your digital photography processes,
making digital photography even more fun and gratifying.
Foolish Assumptions
This book is intended as a Camera Raw and Photoshop CS2 reference for
those digital photographers who want to develop efficient workflows for pro-
cessing raw images, organizing files, and making corrections and edits in
Photoshop. If you have an advanced digital camera or digital SLR that can cap-
ture images in raw format, a computer (with a lot of memory and storage
space!), Photoshop CS2, and even a photo-quality printer, you probably have
all you need to get started!
Here is a list of things I assume you already have (or will be adding to your
collection shortly):
 Digital SLR or advanced compact digital camera: For digital photogra-
phers who want to shoot in raw format, having a digital camera that can
produce raw files is a pretty good idea. Most of the newer (and more
advanced) compact digital cameras — and to my knowledge, all recent-
model digital SLRs — offer the raw format. If your digital camera is a
brand-spanking-new model (if so, congratulations!), it may take Adobe a
few months to come out with an update to Camera Raw that includes
your new model. One thing is certain: You’re going to need some big-
honkin’ memory cards for your digital camera. Raw files can get pretty
big — from 5 megabytes each on up — depending on how many mega-
pixels your digital camera can handle. So I’d also suggest a dedicated

card reader to transfer those big files to your computer. Transferring
files to your computer by attaching a USB cable from your camera can
be a slow and tedious process; getting a card reader is a great invest-
ment, and they don’t cost much (especially when you consider that your
time is valuable).
 Computer: To work with Photoshop, you need a computer with enough
memory and a decent monitor. Photoshop CS2 requires that your com-
puter have at least 384 megabytes of memory. (And remember: As a rule,
minimum requirements barely get the job done; try to exceed those
specs whenever possible.) If you are shooting and processing raw files,
I’d recommend at least 1 gigabyte of memory for your computer. Digital
photo files, especially raw, gobble up disk space (I’d recommend at least
100 gigabytes for starters). You’ll be surprised at how fast disk space
gets used up.
 Colorimeter: Color management is a super-important part of your over-
all workflow. If you’re not using color-management tools, I strongly sug-
gest you look into purchasing a colorimeter and a software package that
will allow you to calibrate your monitor. If you can ensure that what you
see on your computer is what prints on your printer, you’re better off;
calibration makes it possible.
 Photoshop CS2: Photoshop CS2 is the central part of your digital dark-
room. Just as Windows or Mac OS functions as your computer’s operating
system, Photoshop CS2 is your digital-photography operating system.
New features in CS2 include Adobe Bridge for image management — and
Camera Raw is included.
If you’re still using Photoshop CS, don’t fret! For the most part, the work-
flows in this book apply to you as well; the version of Camera Raw is
very similar, and the File Browser concept of managing files is the same.
 Photo-quality printer: I’m assuming you’re using Photoshop to process
files for printing, but lots of folks use it for publishing in different media
as well. Still, it’s nice to have one of those superior new photo printers
our manufactures have blessed us with. These days, for under $100, you
can find a printer that will more than meet your needs. If you’re making
photos primarily for use on the Web, having a printer on hand helps if
you want an actual photo you can hold, frame, or keep in your wallet.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into parts that address general areas such as organizing
photos, converting raw files, or working with Photoshop. I even include some
fun chapters in The Part of Tens. Feel free to skip around, and if you have the
time, read the book from beginning to end!

Introduction

4
Camera Raw with Photoshop For Dummies 
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet
Okay, not all of us plunge right into digital photography (underwater or other-
wise). So Part I offers an overview for the Photoshop and Camera Raw con-
cepts covered in the rest of the book. It’s a quick-start for shooting in raw
format and getting your images into your computer. Chapter 1 briefly intro-
duces shooting raw, using Bridge, and then using Camera Raw and Photoshop
to process your images. Chapter 2 goes into more detail about the benefits of
raw format, and takes a look at Adobe’s new DNG file format. Chapter 3 speaks
to a topic near and dear to my heart — color management. Chapter 4 explains
the workflows covered throughout the book, and why they can improve your
overall photography and your Photoshop skills.
Part II: Image-Management Workflow
with Adobe Bridge
Adobe Bridge is what ties together all the Photoshop processes, your habits
of image management, and the tweaks you make in Camera Raw and
Photoshop. Image management, in essence, is keeping your digital files orga-
nized and backed up for safekeeping. After all, before you can use ’em, you
have to be able to find ’em, and they have to be where you put ’em. So
Chapter 5 shows you how to get around Bridge and take advantage of its file-
management functions. Chapter 6 shows you how to add information to digi-
tal images to organize and reference them even better for future usage.
Part III: Working with Raw Images
Camera Raw is the program you’ll use to process all your raw images, and
Part III shows you how to do just that, in a smooth raw-image–processing
workflow. Chapter 7 starts you out with understanding color, the basis of pro-
cessing raw images. Chapter 8 gives you a tour of Camera Raw, while Chapter
9 shows you how to use all the tools and controls Camera Raw has to offer.
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows
All aspects of processing images in this book are presented in separate work-
flows that make up your overall image-processing activities. This part explains
the workflows needed to process images in Photoshop after you’ve converted
them in Camera Raw. Chapter 10 shows you workflows for correcting color
and tone in Photoshop. Chapter 11 explains image editing as a workflow —
you know, removing red eye, blemishes, and miscellaneous unwanted parts
of your image (use your imagination). Chapter 12 is dedicated toward prepar-
ing images for output by correctly sizing them, applying color profiles, and
routing them through an efficient printing workflow. 

Part V: The Part of Tens
Always the favorite part of any For Dummies book, The Part of Tens provides
you with a few chapters that add to your growing technical knowledge (and
might enhance your reputation as a guru). Chapter 13 provides you with 10
cool things to do with your photos — such as creating abstracts, creating a
photo Web site, and stitching panoramas. Chapter 14 shows you 10 cool
Photoshop filters to use when you want to add special effects to your images.
You know. The fun stuff. (Always my favorite subjects to show!)
Icons Used in This Book
What’s a For Dummies book without icons pointing you in the right direction?
This section shows and describes the five icons I use in this book.
This icon alerts you to some of the great new features available in CS2. If
you’re still using CS, you get a peek at the features that are waiting for you
when you upgrade.
Use the text next to this icon as a guide for doing something better with your
images. Often I add tips to the step-by-step instructions to give you some good
ideas on the spot as you work with Bridge, Camera Raw, and Photoshop. 
This icon is used to alert you to a topic that’s important for you not to forget.
Commit these to memory.
What you find next to this icon often helps explain technical topics in clearer
terms. The information provided may not be critical, but the odd nice-to-know
technical facts will make you look real smart in front of your friends.
When you see one of these, don’t run; the sky is not falling! (Not yet, anyway.)
It’s simply a way to stay out of the way of potential trouble when hassles and
glitches are lurking around the corner.
Where to Go from Here
This book isn’t intended to be read from beginning to end like a mystery; it’s
a reference. Drop into it whenever you need a hand getting some pesky tech-
nique to work right. This book is organized to reflect the overall order in which
you’d normally be working with digital images; feel free to look up any topic in
the index and go right to that chapter to find out what you want to know.

To make things even easier, processes are broken down into step-by-step
workflows (gotta love that word), with a bunch of actual Photoshop screen-
shots and photos to provide visual cues. If you want to skip right to the part
on using Bridge (Part II), go ahead! Want to see how to process images in
Camera Raw (Part III)? You can skip to that step, too. I’ve also offered
detailed workflows for making overall corrections, edits, and preparing
images for output in Photoshop (Part IV). Consider this book an end-to-end
guide for using Photoshop and Camera Raw to transform your raw images
into exactly what you want to see.

D
igital photography has offered old-school ﬁlm
photographers more tools and capabilities
than you can shake a stick at! You have some great
digital cameras, powerful computers that are afford-
able, and some rockin’ software like Photoshop CS2
that you can use to tweak, retouch, and even morph
your photos. One rule remains true whether you
shoot ﬁlm or digital: Better photographs start
with the photographer. True, software utilities and
techniques help make a normal blah photo a little
better, but images well exposed, composed, and
focused make much better prints.
After you’ve taken some great photos, there’s
more fun to be had! Well, some folks have fun orga-
nizing and downloading images, converting the raw
ones, and making further corrections and edits in
Photoshop. Okay, it’s an acquired taste — a bit
more complex than driving a roll of ﬁlm down to the
corner drugstore for processing! But think of the
control you now have over how your images turn
out. That’s where some real creativity with digital
photography begins — in the “digital darkroom” —
and that’s what this book is all about. The chapters
in this part help get you started working with the
tools and established processes of the digital
darkroom: Bridge, Camera Raw, Photoshop, and
the workﬂows that give you consistently impres-
sive results.

emember the days (just a few years ago!) when digital photography con-
sisted of having fun shooting photos, transferring them to your com-
puter, and enhancing them using Photoshop? The choices were
simple: shoot in JPEG or TIFF format. JPEG format is pretty
good, but TIFF was supposed to be better (even though the
resulting image files were huge). Before long, we figured
out that JPEG quality was pretty close to TIFF quality;
for the most part, shooting images in TIFF really
didn’t offer much advantage.
Discerning digital photographers have always wanted
a file format that works like a digital equivalent of a
traditional negative — giving the photographer total
control over processing the image data captured by a
digital camera. (Sure, you could skip the tweaking and
leave it all up to the camera’s internal processing soft-
ware — but why settle for blah results?) In the past few
years, new digital camera models have delivered just that —
the raw image format. The software that gives you control of
those raw images is called (logically enough) Camera Raw.

Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
Shooting in the Raw
Well, no, you don’t have to walk around wearing only your camera when you
take photographs. I’m referring to shooting photos in the raw format with
your digital camera. Today’s digital SLR and advanced compact cameras
(also called prosumer because their features are in-between “pro” and “con-
sumer”) can capture images in raw format, leaving the enhancements up to
the digital photographer. That unprocessed image file — a digital negative —
provides more artistic control. An example is the image shown in Figure 1-1.
Figure 1-1: Raw format gives photographers more creative control in processing images.
Why raw?
As a photographer, I shoot in raw format because it gives me better creative
control over the image data captured by my digital camera. Raw format gives
me an image file created exactly as the digital camera’s sensor captured it. I
can adjust white balance, tint, brightness/contrast, and hue/saturation
exactly the way I want. I don’t have to settle for what my digital camera’s
firmware (built-in internal software) does to the image.
As an added bonus, shooting images in raw format gives me a huge advan-
tage over JPEG: I can correct nearly any incorrect exposure or off-kilter white
balance I may have made while shooting. Don’t get me wrong, getting the cor-
rect exposure and white balance is still just good photographic practice and
well worth the effort — you have less tweaking to do later — but sometimes,
when you’re out in the field taking photos and (say) that bright green UFO
lands right over there, you may have to shoot first and ask questions later.
Also, getting an accurate reading of the exposure is tricky if you’re simply
squinting at the images you’ve just taken (and their tiny histograms) on your
digital camera’s LCD screen — especially if you’re shooting outdoors on a
Unprocessed raw image

bright, sunny day. When you download those images to your computer and
view them in Photoshop, you may discover that your image is either under-
or overexposed. (It happens!) Raw format lets you use the capabilities of
Photoshop to compensate for under- or overexposed photos without degrad-
ing the quality of the image. It’s a nice backup if you ever need it.
Not all raw files are the same
Contrary to popular belief, not all raw images are the same; after all not all
images — and not all cameras — are the same. The actual image data col-
lected by a digital camera’s image sensor can vary noticeably from one manu-
facturer to another; the electronics are different from model to model. For
that reason, camera manufacturers offer their own proprietary software to
process the raw images produced by their cameras.
If you purchase (for example) a
Nikon digital camera such as the
model shown in Figure 1-2, and that
model offers the ability to capture
raw images, you can process those
raw files with a proprietary pro-
gram, either Nikon Picture Project
or Nikon Capture (advanced raw-
conversion software available at an
additional cost). If you also own a
Canon digital camera that produces
raw images, however, you won’t be
able to use Nikon’s software to
process them. For those images, you
have to use Canon’s proprietary soft-
ware, Digital Photo Professional —
but you can’t process Nikon images
using Canon’s software. And if (like the pros) you also have other cameras 
by other makers . . . you get the idea. So did Adobe. That’s why Camera Raw
exists.
I detail the advantages and disadvantages (yes, there are some) of shooting
raw images in Chapter 2.
Though different camera manufactures have their own versions of “the” raw
format, Photoshop CS2 provides a standard platform you can use to process
just about any raw image, regardless of all that proprietary fuss. As an added
bonus, Camera Raw can handle the whole process of adjusting and editing
your raw images (called workflow) with no need to add other software pro-
grams. (Imagine that — something about photography has actually become
simpler!) Adobe provides a list of the digital cameras with which Camera Raw
is compatible at http://adobe.com. (For more about workflow concepts,
spin through Part IV.)

Transferring Image Files to Your Computer
If you’re already well versed in transferring images to your computer, feel free
to skip to the next section. (I won’t even be offended. Honest.) If you’re still
wrestling with transferring images from your camera to your computer, you
can use any of several methods, but these two are the most common:
 Connecting your digital camera directly to your computer. When you
first get your digital camera home from the camera store, you have to
unpack all those manuals, CDs, and cables that come in the box. The
CDs include a software utility
used to transfer images to your
computer; one of the cables is
for plugging your digital camera
into your computer so you can
transfer the images. (Refer to
your camera’s owner’s manual
to figure out which connection
on the camera to plug the cable
into. The other end of the cable
connects to your computer’s
FireWire or USB port.)
 Using a card reader. The fastest
way to download images to
your computer is to use a card
reader. Card readers (such as
the one shown in Figure 1-3) are devices that plug into your computer’s
USB port or (with some models) the faster FireWire port, providing an
efficient way to transfer images — often from various cards with differ-
ent formats such as Compact Flash, SD (secure digital), or memory stick.
Using a card reader to download images to your computer also offers added
security. With a direct connection, there’s often the worry that your digital
camera’s battery might go dead while the image transfer is going on. A card
reader can be especially reassuring if you have a large batch of images to
transfer, and want it to happen correctly the first time.
To download images to your computer, follow these steps:
1. Determine where you want the downloaded images to go on your
computer.
If you’re a Windows user, the easiest place to put your downloaded
images is in the My Pictures folder (opened by choosing My Computer➪
My Pictures). You can also create a new folder to hold your images.
(More information on image management and creating image folders can
be found in Chapter 4.) On a Mac running OS X, the Pictures folder is a
convenient location for downloading your images to. 
Figure 1-3: Card readers are the fastest, safest
way to download images to your computer.

2. Plug your digital camera into the computer, using the supplied USB or
FireWire cable.
Before you connect, make sure your digital camera is turned off. If you
are using a card reader, make sure it’s plugged into an available USB or
FireWire port on you computer.
3. Turn on your digital camera or
insert a card into your card
reader. 
Turning on your digital camera
will automatically start the
downloading process on your
computer. If you’re using a card
reader, inserting a memory card
into the card reader starts the
downloading process automati-
cally. Your computer recognizes
the digital camera or card
reader as an external device
and displays the window shown
in Figure 1-4. 
4. Copy images to your computer.
Choose to open your folder,
using Windows Explorer as
shown in Figure 1-4. As your
computer recognizes your digital camera or card reader as an external
device (or drive), choose to open Windows Explorer to view your images.
Copy all the images shown to a folder of your choice on your hard drive.
To better organize image folders on your computer, create a new folder to
download each memory card to. Give each folder a name such as “Grand
Canyon photos” to describe what’s inside. It’s a lot better than copying all of
your images to the same folder every time (trust me on this one), and it helps
you organize and find your original images later.
Never move images directly from your memory card to a folder. If you use the
Move command, the images will be removed from the memory card as they are
copied to the folder you chose to copy to. If the copying process is interrupted
during copying, you can potentially lose images! Additionally, it’s better to
format your memory cards in your camera to remove old images, rather than
erase them with your computer. By using your digital camera to format your
cards, you’ll ensure you are using the correct formatting algorithm your digital
camera uses. 
To help ensure regret-free image transfer, make it a habit to format your
memory cards only after you’ve downloaded the images to your computer —
and have made a backup to CD or DVD. (I cover backing up images in 
Chapter 4.)

Working with Images in Bridge
When you’ve successfully transferred that batch of raw images to a folder
where they just wait for a good tweaking, they’re in Adobe territory. Here’s
where some handy new Photoshop CS2 and Camera Raw capabilities come
into play — in particular Bridge.
New to Photoshop CS2 is Adobe Bridge. Bridge is an upgrade to the File
Browser we came to love in previous versions of Photoshop — but it’s better!
Bridge is now a standalone application that can be launched independent of
the Creative Suite programs, or from within Photoshop CS2, Illustrator CS2,
GoLive CS2, and InDesign CS2. Bridge provides better integration between
the Creative Suite programs, but if you use only Photoshop CS2, it works
great as your standalone or integrated program to organize, browse, or
locate photos. Bridge also serves as the launching point to process raw
images in Camera Raw. 
Starting Bridge
Bridge can be started independent of Photoshop CS2. It’s set up as any other
program in Windows or on the Mac. The other way to start Bridge is through
Photoshop CS2:
1. Start Photoshop CS2 by either double-clicking the icon on your desk-
top or by choosing Start➪Photoshop CS2. 
You can also press Alt+Ctrl+O (Option+Ô+O on a Mac).
2. From Photoshop, choose File➪Browse or just click the Go to Bridge
button. 
The Go to Bridge button is located on the right side of the Photoshop
CS2 Option bar shown in Figure 1-5. On a Mac, double-click the Bridge
icon (located in the Applications/Adobe Bridge folder).
Figure 1-5: To start Bridge, simply click the Go To Bridge button located on the CS2 Option bar.

Browsing folders and opening images
Okay, file management is always an issue when you’re dealing with applica-
tions that generate scads of files and copies-of-files (as Photoshop does).
Chapters 5 and 6 plunge into the details of file management and reveal the
wonders using all the major features of Adobe Bridge. For the moment, I
show you how to do a quick browse through the folders — and when you find
an image you want, how to open it in Camera Raw and Photoshop CS2. So
here’s Square One: Figure 1-6 shows how the Bridge window looks right after
you open Bridge.

Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
To browse image folders located on your computer with Bridge:
1. Click the Folders tab. 
Clicking the Folders tab shows
you your computer’s drives and
folders (as shown in Figure 1-7),
enabling you to navigate your
computer’s folders to locate the
folder you want to view — say, a
folder you recently downloaded
new images to. 
2. Choose the image folder you
wish to view. 
Figure 1-8 shows a series of 
folders I created to hold my
images. Click a folder to view 
its contents in the Bridge
Content area.
Creating your image folders and
downloading images to the
same area on your computer
makes it easier for you to locate
images in Bridge. 
3. Select an image.
Single-clicking an image in the
Bridge Content area shows you
an image’s metadata (informa-
tion such as the camera settings
you used when you shot the
photo), in the Metadata tab,
along with a thumbnail of the
image in the Preview area.
When you’ve selected a photo,
slide the Resize Thumbnails
slider all the way to the right to
enlarge the thumbnail to get a
better view of the image. You’ll
be able to see more detail of the image to better judge whether or not
the image is sharp enough or focused correctly. Images can look great
when they are viewed as smaller thumbnails, but when you view them at
larger sizes, you can better judge whether the images are good enough

to locate your image files.

to use. Figure 1-9 shows a photo
of little duckies. (Actually, these
are baby swans, but I like duck-
ies. Humor me.)
Those (ahem) duckies looked
good in the thumbnail, but
enlarging the thumbnail view
gives me a closer look: Is the
photo focused properly and is
its overall detail sharp?
By the way, the reason I know
they’re swans is because the
mother swan was only a few feet
away and she would actually
growl at me if I got too close to
her babies. Lucky I was toting a
70-300mm lens for my Nikon D70 that day, so I could shoot the photo
from a swan-safe distance.
4. Open the image. 
After you’ve browsed images in Bridge and have chosen an image to edit,
double-click the thumbnail. If the image is a raw file, it opens automati-
cally in Camera Raw. If the image is in another format (such as JPEG, TIFF,
or PSD), it opens automatically in Photoshop. You can also right-click
(Control+click a Mac) and choose Open from the menu to open the image.
Using Camera Raw
Adobe first introduced Camera Raw with Photoshop version 7 and has consis-
tently improved this tool with the next versions, CS and CS2. Improvements
such as clipping warnings (when Camera Raw indicates part of an image where
over-/underexposure occurs, thus eliminating otherwise good image informa-
tion), curves, and the addition of auto-adjustments have made Camera Raw a
powerful tool to process your raw images. Camera Raw’s seamless integration
with Adobe Bridge and Photoshop makes it the tool of choice for many pho-
tographers who shoot raw and use Photoshop. No surprise there.
For me, Camera Raw is a powerful enough tool that I ignore the raw-image-
conversion software from the manufacturers of the digital cameras I use.
(Sure, I keep the discs — that’s just a good practice — but I don’t use them.) 
I like the idea of using one program that allows me to use raw files from differ-
ent manufacturers’ cameras and to work directly with Bridge and Photoshop
CS2, so my choice is simple: I use Camera Raw.

Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
I recently had the opportunity to photograph many historic sites and spec-
tacular gardens in England and Wales. Figure 1-10 shows one of those photos,
opened in the Camera Raw window — a scene photographed in a difficult
lighting situation: bright, late-morning sun. Adjusting some exposure and
color for this image in Camera Raw enables me to make overall color adjust-
ments without degrading the information contained in the image.
Figure 1-10: The Camera Raw window. 
One advantage of making overall adjustments (also referred to as tonal adjust-
ments) in Camera Raw is that doing so keeps the overall quality of the image
intact. Whenever you adjust the exposure, brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation
in Photoshop, you actually destroy information in the image file. The more adjust-
ments you make to the image, the more information you potentially destroy,
degrading the overall quality of the image. Making as many of these overall
adjustments as you can in Camera Raw will guarantee that you retain the data
that makes up the image file. Consider it a route to a higher-quality end product.

Becoming familiar with Camera Raw
The Camera Raw window is laid out simply. Commands aren’t buried in a
series of menus, and the Adjustment tabs are visible (refer to Figure 1-10)
when you first open an image in Camera Raw. Commonly used tools are easily
available to you on the Camera Raw Option bar, and the Image window is
simple to operate (with zoom controls laid out at the bottom of the image).
The Camera Raw window is made up of these sections:
 Option bar: The Option bar provides tools to help you move around,
select a white point of the image (to correct white balance), crop,
straighten, and rotate an image. The Option bar also includes check
boxes you can use to toggle the image preview on and off — an easy way
to switch between the original (unadjusted) image and the image as it
appears while you’re making adjustments.
 Image window: The area where you can view, zoom, crop, straighten,
and rotate your image, using the tools in the Option bar. 
 Workflow options: The area at the bottom of the Camera Raw window
where you can modify the color space, size, and resolution of an image.
(Chapter 8 provides more detail on workflow options.)
 Histogram: The histogram is the graph displayed in the upper-right part
of the Camera Raw menu: a graphical view of how much red, green, and
blue make up the image, and how each color is distributed.
 Adjustment tabs: The area to the right of the Camera Raw window contains
tabs where Adjust, Detail, Lens, Curve, and Calibrate controls are located.
Adjusting images in Camera Raw
Camera Raw is a powerful enough tool that it’s a good idea to get a handle on
some of its new features before you go on a tweaking rampage. Here’s the
quick tour — followed by a small rampage.
One of the new convenient features of Photoshop CS2 is the addition of auto
adjustments in Camera Raw. When you open a raw image in Camera Raw,
auto adjustments for Exposure, Shadows, Brightness, and Contrast are auto-
matically made. For some images, auto settings for these adjustments may be
sufficient; however, I encourage you to look at each one and move the sliders
to the left or right to see whether you can get a better result. 
The steps to make overall adjustments in Camera Raw include these:
1. Adjust White Balance and Tint.
White balance can be adjusted using either the White Balance selection
box or the Temperature control. Both will adjust the white balance of the
image if needed. Changing the settings in the White Balance selection 
box will adjust both the Temperature and Tint to match the Camera Raw
19
Chapter 1: Getting to Know Bridge, Camera Raw, and Photoshop

20
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
pre-determined color conditions for that particular setting. As an exam-
ple, the Daylight white balance setting changes the (virtual) Temperature
to 5500K and the Tint to a setting of +10. For finer tuning of the white bal-
ance, you can adjust the Temperature and Tint separately by using the
adjustment sliders for both of those adjustments. 
This adjustment is best used on photos that used the wrong white bal-
ance setting when they were shot — say, a photo shot in bright sunlight
while the digital camera’s white balance was set to Florescent. (Yikes.)
The wrong white balance setting results in odd color shifts, as in the
photo shown in Figure 1-11. For this photo, I actually like the result I got
as shot, where the Cloudy and Florescent settings show incorrect color
for the photo. But strictly realistic it isn’t.
Figure 1-11: Adjusting the white balance. 
2. Adjust Exposure.
The Exposure control is a digital camera user’s best friend. I’m not one to
abdicate the fact that all of your photos have to be properly exposed when
you click that camera shutter. (Hey, we all know that doesn’t happen in the
real world! At least nowhere near often enough.) The biggest challenge for
photographers is capturing images that are correctly exposed and sharp.
You can’t really correct unfocused images, but the Exposure adjustment
allows you to correct an image that’s under- or overexposed. As with other
adjustments in Camera Raw, increasing or decreasing the exposure to
obtain the results you want doesn’t degrade the quality of the image file.
Click the Auto check box to let Camera Raw automatically adjust your
exposure. Camera Raw will choose the optimum setting to the point at
which the image isn’t under- or overexposed, just shy of the point at
which the shadows and highlights start to lose definition (called clipping).
As shot
Cloudy
Fluorescent

Changing any of the control settings in Camera Raw can cause clipping.
Clipping occurs when too much of an adjustment — such as adding too
much brightness or contrast — renders parts of an image unusable by
creating areas that are (for example) too light or too dark. Areas that are
too bright and contain no detail are called blown out.
You can monitor if your changes
are causing clipping by clicking
the Shadows and Highlights
check boxes located on the
Camera Raw palette. Clicking
these boxes will show you areas
of the image that are too light or
too dark. Shadow areas that are
clipped appear in blue; highlight
areas that experience clipping
show up in red, as Figure 1-12
shows in an enlarged portion of
the image.
3. Adjust Shadows.
Camera Raw lets you adjust
shadow areas (the very
dark parts) of your image by
increasing or decreasing the
brightness in these areas
while not affecting the highlight
areas. Try the Auto setting for
Shadows first, or you can move the slider to the left or right to get the
effect you want. Make sure you keep the Shadows check box checked to
limit and monitor clipping. If clipping occurs while you’re making a
Shadows adjustment, move the slider until the clipping in the shadowed
areas disappears. 
4. Adjust Brightness. 
The Brightness control allows you to increase or decrease how bright
your image appears independent of the Exposure setting. The
Brightness setting is best used in conjunction with other Camera Raw
adjustments, such as Contrast and Saturation. Changing the contrast
and saturation may require you to increase or decrease the brightness
of the image slightly to compensate for the harsher changes.
5. Adjust Contrast. 
The Contrast control simply allows you to darken the dark areas of an
image while brightening the lighter areas of an image. The Auto setting
for Contrast may be the optimum setting for Contrast, but feel free to
move the slider to the right to increase contrast in the image until you
get the result you want.

Chapter 1: Getting to Know Bridge, Camera Raw, and Photoshop
Figure 1-12: Clipping in the highlight areas
appears in red if the Highlights check box is
checked. 

22
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
6. Adjust Saturation. 
Before you adjust a raw photo, it may appear
dull and lacking in contrast. Don’t worry! The
color information is still in the file — all you
have to do is increase the Saturation control to
bring out the color. (Personally, the Saturation
control is my favorite! I can’t wait to get into
Camera Raw, tweak my Exposure, Shadows,
Brightness, Contrast, and then increase the sat-
uration and watch my photos “come alive”.) 
There isn’t an Auto setting for saturation. You
have to do it by hand, increasing color satura-
tion by moving the Saturation slider to the
right. Figure 1-13 shows the original image and
the image adjusted in Camera Raw.
7. Click Open. 
Clicking the Open button will then open your
converted raw image into the Photoshop
window, where you can make further adjust-
ments and edits to your heart’s content. You
can also click the Done button to save your
Camera Raw settings for the image and return to
Bridge without opening the image in Photoshop. 
At this point, Camera Raw saves your changes, but
not to the original raw file. Camera Raw leaves the
original alone, but it does add your changes to a
sidecar file, a file created to contain changes you’ve
added to the original raw image. These files are
small, and are given an XMP file extension. 
Hello Photoshop CS2!
I bet you were wondering when I’d get to Photoshop
CS2! (Well, back to it anyway.) Thanks for being patient, but in this chapter, it’s
first things first; Bridge and Camera Raw are, after all, the first steps you take
as you get into processing raw images. When you’re familiar with browsing
images, opening them, and then converting them in Camera Raw, you’re ready
to poke around in Photoshop CS2, check out the new features, and dive back
into processing your images with a slew of new tools to use. 
What’s new?
The Photoshop version CS2 hasn’t changed much from the past few versions
(CS2 is actually version 9!), but a whole slew of new features have appeared
under the hood. 
As shot
Adjusted in Camera Raw
Figure 1-13: Original image,
and the image adjusted in
Camera Raw.

I cover these features in Part III, but here are a few popular new ones: 
 New Exposure control: Photoshop now includes a new control that lets
you adjust exposure outside of Camera Raw that can be used for JPEG
or TIFF images. 
 New Blur and Sharpen filters: CS2 provides us with more Blur and
Sharpen tools, I cover both in more detail in Chapters 11 and 12.
Figure 1-14 shows the new Smart Sharpen filter — bound to be the
new photographer’s favorite CS2 sharpening tool for photos.
Figure 1-14: The new Smart Sharpen tool provides the photographer 
with more options for sharpening photos.
 Vanishing Point filter: This feature is tailored to advanced users who
seek to edit images in perfect perspective.
 Smart Objects: Using these, you can make edits to an image file while
linking the image to the original. Linking to the original lets you maintain
the quality of an image; your photos remain sharp even after extensive
edits because the linked original remains unchanged. I’ve found that
even some older, low-resolution digital images can benefit from this fea-
ture, especially those I’ve edited extensively. 
 Lens Correction filter: The new Lens Correction filter provides the 
capability to correct lens shortcomings such as barrel distortion and
vignetting. Those of you who are familiar with those problems probably
feel like cheering. Here’s the gist: Some lenses at extreme settings create
slight darkened borders around an image, called vignetting. Also, you can
see visible distortion at extreme zoom settings, especially wide angle.
 Red Eye tool: The new Red Eye tool lets you easily correct the red eye
effect that plagues so many snapshots of family and friends who really
don’t want to look like insomniacs or vampires.

 Spot Healing Brush tool: I use this tool a lot to correct blemishes on
skin or get rid of stray gum wrappers on the floors of architectural
images (such as the example shown in Figure 1-15). Nothing can ruin a
photographer’s mood like traveling a few thousand miles, taking photos
of historic sites, and then viewing images littered with garbage on the
floor! The Spot Healing Brush comes in handy for just those situations.
(Too bad there isn’t a real-life equivalent.)
Figure 1-15: The Spot Healing Brush is a great tool to help clean up 
parts of a photo.

 WYSIWYG fonts: Great acronym, but what does it mean? (Just kidding.
What You See Is What You Get has been around for a few years.)
Photoshop now shows you exactly what the font will look like when 
you add text to a Photoshop document using the Text tool.
Getting around Photoshop CS2
Getting around Photoshop can seem a little intimidating at first, but after
you get used to working with menus, palettes, and the Toolbox, you’ll get
comfortable pretty quickly. The trick is knowing what features are available
and where to find them. So, by way of a little exploration, Figure 1-16 shows
the Photoshop window and these essential areas:
 Menus: In the menu bar you’ll find a whole slew of utilities, commands,
filters, and settings. Familiar menus such as File, Edit, View, Window,
and Help are there, and if you’re used to working in Windows or the 
Mac, you’ll be instantly comfortable with these. 
 Option bar: The Option bar resides just below the menu bar and is
reserved for settings related to tools chosen from the Toolbox.
 Toolbox: The Toolbox is (well, yeah) a collection of tools you use to
edit images. Many of those tools are like camping knives; they have
multiple tools inside them. Just right-click a tool and you’ll see a flyout
menu that shows you more tools. 
I sometimes refer to these tools as “my little friends” — they don’t
talk to me, but I can talk to them. No, really: You can use one of
these tools — the Audio Annotation tool — to record audio
messages and attach the recordings to an image. Talking pictures,
anyone?
 Image window: The Image window is where the image you opened
in Bridge or from Camera Raw resides.
 Palettes: Palettes are control panels that provide information to
you or enable you to perform specific editing processes to your
image. For instance, the Info palette provides color information
regarding specific areas of an image, where the Layers palette
enables you to view, edit, and create the needed fill and adjustment
layers.

Making adjustments
Though the goal with making overall adjustments in Camera Raw is to reduce
the sheer number of overall adjustments needed in Photoshop, there is still
much creative work to do! Photoshop is actually where you take the steps to
complete the adjusting and editing of your image. The following overview of
this process (known as “workflow”) summarizes the steps for making quick
tonal adjustments and edits to an image:

1. Open an image in Photoshop. 
Using Bridge, open an image in Camera Raw, make adjustments, and
then click the Open button. The image opens in Photoshop. 
2. Save the image as a PSD file. 
After opening an image in Photoshop from Camera Raw, the file is still
in the digital format native to the camera that took the picture — for
example, NEF for a Nikon digital camera or CRW for a Canon model.
Additionally, you don’t want to adjust or edit the original file; that
process destroys some of the
original data, and you should
only do that with a copy. Saving
the image to another folder in
Photoshop format is the best
method of keeping your images
organized and your original
image preserved.
Select File➪Save As, or press
Shift+Ctrl+S (Shift+Ô+S on a
Mac). The Save As window
shown in Figure 1-17 gives 
you the choices to select a
folder, change the filename if
you choose, and most impor-
tantly change the file format.
Select the folder you want to
save your working file to, and
then click the Format selection 
box to select Photoshop
(*.PSD,*.PDD) as the file 
format. Click the Save button
to save your working file.
3. Duplicate the background layer. 
As you’ll discover, I’m a stickler for making backups and protecting origi-
nal files — and layers. In Photoshop, images are adjusted and edited in
separate layers. When you open an image, all the image information is
contained in the background layer. Each adjustment you make should be
made in its own layer. That way, if you need to correct an adjustment,
27
Chapter 1: Getting to Know Bridge, Camera Raw, and Photoshop
Figure 1-17: The Save As window. 

28
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
you can always go back to that
particular layer and make
changes without affecting the
other layers. You can also delete
a layer if you don’t like an
adjustment you made — and
keep the original image intact!
When you’ve finished making
changes to your image, you’ll
have a number of layers, each
with its own adjustment or
edit. (Working in layers gets
the detailed treatment in
Chapter 10.) 
To back up and protect the orig-
inal “background” layer, choose
Layer➪Duplicate. 
4. Adjust Color Levels.
Create a Levels adjustment layer
by clicking the Create Layer
button located on the bottom
of the Layers palette (see
Figure 1-18).
Shown in Figure 1-19, the Levels
adjustment window shows you
a graphical representation of
the color (red, green, and blue
channels) distribution of the
image, also referred to as the
histogram. Under the histogram
are three sliders. The slider 
on the left controls the shadow portions of the image, the middle slider
the midtones (also called gamma) of the image, and the slider on the
right controls the amount of color in the highlight areas of the image.
With the default Channel set to RGB, move the left and right sliders to the
point of the histogram where pixels begin to show up clearly. Moving the
middle slider to the right increases contrast in the image by darkening
the highlight areas. Experiment with moving the sliders until you get the
result you want.
Figure 1-18: Creating a new Levels adjustment
layer. 

Figure 1-19: Adjusting Levels.
5. Adjust Saturation.
My favorite adjustment can be found in the Saturation layer. Saturation
allows you to increase color in your image. To make your images “pop”
with some color, click the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer button on
the Layers palette and choose Hue/Saturation. In the Hue/Saturation
window (shown in Figure 1-20), move the Saturation slider to the right to
increase color in your image. Be careful not to add too much color; if
you do, clipping can occur. Sometimes a little goes a long way!
6. Save the image. 
After making adjustments, save
the image by choosing File➪
Save or by clicking the Save
button on the Option bar.

L
uckily for shutterbugs, the technology of digital photography is always
evolving. Earlier compact digital cameras were pretty advanced; their 
3-to-5-megapixel capability produced pretty good JPEG images. But these
cameras have now evolved to 7-to-9-megapixel sensors, bigger lenses (with
vibration reduction), and greater ease of use. You can even shoot in auto-
matic mode or set aperture priority or shutter priority to whet your creative
shooting tastes. As a bonus, the macro capabilities of these cameras are
phenomenal!
These advances mean you have more choices in equip-
ment and capabilities. Today’s affordable digital SLRs
(and advanced compact “prosumer” cameras) boast
capabilities we only dreamed of a few years ago —
but their biggest advantage is that the latest models
can shoot in raw format.
Raw format provides the photographer with more
options for bringing out the best in digital images.
You get more control over color, exposure, and
sharpness — and if you’re like me, the more control,
the better. If you give a painter a greater selection of
better paints, more brushes, and a bigger canvas to work
with, you’ll notice the difference in the paintings. Raw gives
the photographer exactly that — a wider range of creative
choices, more detailed control over color and tones, and a bigger canvas
to work with.

Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
What’s Raw?
Quite simply, a raw file can be described in the same terms as a film negative
that hasn’t been processed yet — only without the chemical stink. The image
data is there, but it needs to be developed. In effect, Camera Raw is the vir-
tual equivalent of the film-development chemicals that were the only way to
develop color images before digital cameras. You could say that shooting in
raw is environmentally friendly, too! No toxic gunk to bite your fingers or pol-
lute the environment — just you, your computer, and Photoshop CS2.
When you shoot a raw image, your digital camera collects data. The raw
image file is just a recording of what the image sensor has collected. In raw
mode, your digital camera doesn’t do anything with the data, it just saves it
to a file. No processing is performed like when you shoot in TIFF or JPEG
format. The file doesn’t become an image until the photographer processes
it. Figure 2-1 shows just what a raw file looks like without being processed.
It’s dull, lifeless, and without vibrant color. 
Figure 2-1: An unprocessed raw file, just waiting for you to develop it.
Because I brought up the topic of film, there is a huge difference between the
chemical processing of film and the digital processing of raw-format files.
With film, you get only one chance at processing the file. If the temperature 
of the chemicals are wrong, or the length of time in processing is wrong, the
negatives get ruined. You can’t go back and do anything to fix that. You only

get one shot at developing film. If you make a mistake, your film — and the
photos you shot on it — are (technically speaking) hosed . . . wasted . . . toast . . .
destroyed. With digital raw files, you can process your images many times! Go
ahead and make some mistakes, it doesn’t matter! You can always go back to
the original digital raw image and process the image again.
Being an old film guy who’s developed many rolls of film in my old chemical
darkroom, I think raw is a beautiful thing.
One of the reasons the raw photos first appear dull and lifeless is because
raw files are for the most part captured in grayscale. Don’t get me wrong —
there is color information in a raw file, you can see some in the photo in
Figure 2-1, which shows how the image looks when first opened in Camera
Raw. Color characteristics are recorded for each pixel as red, green, or blue; a
raw-converter program such as Camera Raw will interpret the color during
conversion. That’s why more color becomes visible as you make adjustments
in Camera Raw.
Camera Raw converts a raw file by interpolating color information: The 
raw converter knows the color associated with a particular pixel, but 
“borrows” color from neighboring pixels to create the needed color.
Additionally, Camera Raw opens a raw image with some automatic tonal
adjustments made for you, however, saturation is not automatically added.
Figure 2-2 shows the same image as in Figure 2-1, after color is extracted in
Camera Raw. 
Figure 2-2: The processed raw file shows the true color of the original image.

Raw versus Other Formats
Okay, raw format may not be ideal
for every photographic situation. I
shot thousands of images in JPEG
format before the raw format made it
into advanced compact digital SLR
cameras. Many of those photos are
permanent staples in my portfolio.
And yes, I admit it: I still shoot JPEGs
sometimes. I carry around a compact
digital camera that produces great 7
megapixel images (Figure 2-3, for
example). My compact camera is
convenient for snapshots or interest-
ing subjects I come across while dri-
ving around town — and it serves as
a backup while I’m shooting nature
photos. But for those images (as for
all my more serious shooting), I use
my digital SLR — in raw format, of
course!
Though I have a nice collection of
images from earlier digital cameras
(and I still carry a compact around
in my pocket), I often run into
the limitations of shooting in
JPEG or TIFF format — these,
for instance:
 Loss of image data while making adjustments in Photoshop: Shooting
JPEG, you can run into this problem a lot. Without the lossless overall
color and tonal adjustments that you’d get in Camera Raw, you have
to make those adjustments in Photoshop — and they’d better be
right the first time. You lose image data every time you save, reopen,
and readjust a JPEG in Photoshop. In essence, every adjustment
affects the tonal range of the image; you’re throwing away bits of
information, leaving less data available for creating the image (a
destructive effect).
Figure 2-3: Shooting in JPEG can produce
great images, but you can’t do as much to
them.

When shooting in raw format, you have the advantage of making adjust-
ments in Camera Raw to white balance, tint, exposure, shadows, curves,
brightness, contrast, and color saturation — without the risk of losing
image data (and some image quality along with it).
 Limited white-balance adjustment: When I’m out in the field shooting
(with my digital camera, always!), I’ll often set the white balance on the
camera to best match the lighting conditions I’m faced with. I’ll use the
auto-white balance setting in some situations as well. If I’m shooting
JPEG or TIFF and discover later when editing those images in Photoshop
that the white balance needs adjustment, it will take a lot of work to
make those corrections. If I’m shooting raw, I can easily adjust the white
balance any way I need to.
 Limited exposure adjustment: I hear this argument all the time; “Good
photographers should always get the right exposure when they shoot
photos so they don’t have to make adjustments in software later.” That’s
good advice and should always be suggested as a goal — but in the real
world, sometimes a perfect exposure just doesn’t happen. Even the best
photographers shoot photos that need some exposure adjustment in
software. If I’m shooting in JPEG or TIFF format and I need to adjust
exposure after the fact, I have to use Photoshop CS2 Exposure adjust-
ment to do the job — and although this feature is a welcome addition for
JPEGs, it can still degrade image quality.
Shooting in raw format means you don’t have to settle for the exposure
you get with the shot; you can fix under- or overexposed photos in
Camera Raw, using its Exposure adjustment. Even better, you can do that
without losing image data (which is what happens if you shoot in JPEG
and use the Photoshop Exposure feature to tweak exposure later).
 Limited image quality due to compression: JPEG is a compressed file
format. When you shoot a JPEG image, your digital camera processes
the image, and then compresses it. One of the side effects of compres-
sion is the fact that you lose image data in the process. It’s really not
noticeable, but when you’re using an 8-bit file format such as JPEG, you
need all the image data you can get. 
When you open JPEG images in Photoshop to begin adjusting and edit-
ing, make sure you save them as a file format other than JPEG when you
import them into Photoshop. Converting the images to PSD or TIFF
format will help avoid the image degradation that happens every
time you save a JPEG file. Figure 2-4 shows the effects of resaving
JPEG images while editing them in Photoshop: More artifacts creep
into the image after it’s been resaved a few times.

Advantages and Disadvantages to Raw
Okay, even though this book is about shooting images in raw format and follow-
ing the steps to completing your images for display by using Bridge, Camera
Raw, and Photoshop, let’s keep it real: There are both advantages and disad-
vantages to shooting and processing raw images. Many pro-level photogra-
phers don’t mind taking the few extra steps that raw format entails — generally
they get higher-quality images that way — but JPEG images are often faster to
take if the opportunity to get a shot is fleeting. Bottom line: It’s a three-way
tradeoff. The individual photographer has to balance the speed and conve-
nience of JPEG against the greater control and image quality that are possible
in raw format.

Taking advantage of raw format
Of all the advantages that shooting raw offers compared to JPEG, the biggest is
control. When shooting photos for my fine-art portfolio or for portraits, I want
complete control over the tonal adjustments to my images. Even though the
latest digital cameras are pretty handy at processing images, almost all need
post-processing help in Photoshop. Shooting in raw format lets me judge and
adjust color and exposure for each individual photo if I choose. I don’t have to
trust blindly that my digital camera automatically produces images that match
my taste; I have the data I need to make them look right.
In addition to giving you control over the processing of your images in raw
format, Camera Raw provides other advantages over JPEGs or TIFFs:
 Full use of all the information captured: Shooting in raw format gives
the photographer all the data the digital camera’s image sensor cap-
tures, thus providing the photographer with more data to work with to
make adjustments, edits, and sizing later in Photoshop. You’re not lim-
ited to the reduced data in a compressed 8-bit JPEG file (as detailed in
the next section).
 Easy exposure adjustment without losing image data: Figure 2-5 shows
a photo I shot at dusk (a difficult lighting situation) to capture the reflec-
tion of the sky on a pond. It was a tough task to get the right exposure
for the image in a neutral part of the image. As it turned out, I was off a
little in my exposure setting, but no problem: I used the Camera Raw
Exposure control to increase the exposure by 1 1/2 f-stops.
Figure 2-5: Adjusting exposure “after the fact” is one advantage to shooting raw.
37
Chapter 2: Enlightened by Raw

38
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
Some digital SLRs underexpose photos by about one f-stop when shoot-
ing in raw mode. That’s by design; it prevents you from blowing out parts
of the image (that is, overexposing certain parts of the image so no
usable image data emerges). Such underexposure saves you from ending
up with (say) unusable pure white as part of a sky. You could deal with
extremes of exposure by using exposure compensation (if your camera
has that feature) — or you could use Camera Raw to adjust the exposure
after you shoot — and probably get better results. Keep in mind that it’s
often easier to compensate for underexposed areas than overexposed
areas.
 Easy adjustment of white balance: White balance (or color temperature
and tint, if you want to get real technical) is sometimes difficult to get
right when you’re out shooting with your digital camera. You can use the
auto adjustment, but sometimes the color and tint of the images are
slightly off when you view them in Bridge or Camera Raw. If I’m shooting
raw, I’m not going to sweat too much; I can easily make a change in the
white balance of the image later in Camera Raw. Figure 2-6 shows three
versions of the same image displayed in Camera Raw, as shot in the digi-
tal camera using three settings (from left to right): Auto, Cloudy, and
Shade. If I were shooting JPEG, I’d have to jump through hoops to make
the same adjustments in Photoshop.
 Non-destructive adjustment of tone and color: This is the real kicker:
By shooting raw — and converting the images later in Camera Raw —
the photographer can make changes to brightness, contrast, curve tab,
and color saturation without the risk of losing valuable bits of image
data.

A few potential drawbacks
Even with all the great capabilities the raw image format provides, it
actually does have a few disadvantages — not many — but a few are worth
mentioning:
 File size: Raw images aren’t compressed like JPEGs. The file sizes are
much larger — and they take longer to download to your computer. A typ-
ical 8-megapixel raw image will be saved at a size of about 7 megabytes.
The same 8-megapixel image shot in JPEG format will create a file less
than half that size, around 3 megabytes. If you’re cramped for memory-
card space, you’ll be able to fit at least twice as many JPEGs as raw files
on your memory card. Just remember: JPEG compression loses some
quality.
 Extra step in processing: Unlike JPEGs (which you can view immediately
in Photoshop), raw images require an extra step: Opening them in Camera
Raw and processing them. If your workflow is pretty close to the one
explained in Chapter 4 — and you process raw images as shown in
Chapter 9 — then the extra step will be worth the effort; the timesaving
batch processes offered in Bridge can help you make up for lost time.
39
Chapter 2: Enlightened by Raw
The 16-bit advantage
When you’re shooting in raw format, you are
essentially capturing all the data that your
sensor can capture — and today’s digital cam-
eras can capture at least 12 bits per channel
(that is, per each red, green, and blue channel)
for each pixel. When you shoot JPEGs, you cap-
ture images at only 8 bits per channel for each
pixel — you’re already working with less data,
and your digital camera had better process
those 8-bit images correctly. Don’t get me
wrong, you can still get great photos working in
the 8-bit world of JPEGs, but after you get them
into Photoshop, you can do only a limited
amount of processing before image quality
starts to degrade.
When quality counts more than speed, shooting
in raw format — and then editing the photos in
Photoshop, in 16 bit-mode — gives you a large
advantage over JPEGs. That’s because JPEG
quality is no more than what you get via your
digital camera’s software algorithms — results
that are automatic and fast, but maybe not quite
what you want. With raw format, you can make
more accurate adjustments to the image, and
have a lot of image data left over to give you
more options. You can do more extensive edits,
crop, or enlarge — while maintaining image
quality throughout your image. 

40
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
 Slower processing in your digital camera: Some older camera models
that feature the raw format may take a few seconds to process the raw
image before you’re able to shoot another. Too, if you’re shooting raw
and JPEG (some digital cameras can produce two images for one shot),
your digital camera will have additional work to do to produce both the
raw and JPEG files.
 Lack of raw-format standards: Each digital camera manufacturer has
its own version of raw format; proprietary formats reign right now.
So far, those who shoot in raw have only one option that offers some
versatility — Camera Raw, along with a new digital negative (DNG)
format (see the next section) — currently endorsed by Adobe. It’s not
a big issue now, but some photographers worry about what might
happen years down the road: Will future software be able to recognize
current raw images? Adobe seems to be the only company addressing
this issue right now.
The present drawbacks to shooting and processing raw-format images may
not outweigh the advantages for many photographers. And why not?
Cheaper, large-capacity memory cards can handle the extra card space
needed to handle larger files. The extra step in processing really doesn’t cost
you much time — in fact, processing images in Camera Raw can save you
from having to perform similar adjustments in Photoshop — and you can
make adjustments without throwing away valuable bits of data. The final
drawback to raw format (lack of firm industry standards) will most likely be
overcome as technology develops and as more and more photographers use
the raw format.
Introducing the Digital Negative (DNG)
Up to this point in the digital-photography era, raw file formats haven’t been
uniform. Each digital camera manufacturer that offers raw in its digital cam-
eras maintains a proprietary format. (Imagine what it would have been like if
all camera makers designed their cameras only to work with their own pro-
prietary film. Or how about driving cars that only run on one brand of fuel?
You get the idea.) Unfortunately, due to a lack of industry standards, camera
manufacturers are forced to offer their own versions of raw images.
As if to add confusion for photographers, manufacturers package software
with their digital cameras — and it only converts raw images shot in their
version of raw format. Some of these programs work very well, but if you also
shoot raw images using other digital cameras from other manufacturers, you
can’t use the software to convert those images. Camera Raw, at least, works
with raw images from most makers’ digital cameras — a step in the right
direction.

Adobe has recently announced and released its attempt at coming up with
one standard file format for raw images — digital negative (DNG). The intro-
duction of DNG recognizes the need for an industry-standard format for raw
images — and it is indeed a major step forward. But a true industry standard
hasn’t arrived yet; camera manufacturers as a whole have yet to buy in on
DNG. But don’t be too harsh on the industry. The technology is evolving
rapidly, and leading manufacturers have done a terrific job delivering prod-
ucts that photographers want, and rather quickly. Until a raw-image stan-
dard is developed, Adobe’s DNG format and the Digital Negative Converter
software utility (shown in Figure 2-7) make a great first step. You can get a
copy of the Adobe Digital Negative Converter at Adobe’s Web site (go to
www.adobe.com).
Figure 2-7: The Adobe Digital Negative Converter utility. 
41
Chapter 2: Enlightened by Raw

42
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
The potential advantages of using DNG include the following:
 Common raw format: If you’re shooting professionally and need to submit
images to publishers (or other clients who require raw images), DNG pro-
vides a common format for these images. DNG is a non-proprietary format,
and it’s publicly documented.
 Changes and additions to the raw image are embedded within the
DNG: With other raw formats, when you make adjustments or add meta-
data to the raw files, those changes aren’t saved to the actual raw file.
Instead, they’re saved to additional files called sidecar files. With DNG
raw format, all changes and metadata additions are stored within the
DNG file. This reduces the chance of the sidecar files not being copied or
backed up with the original raw files when you move files around during
image management.
 Longer-term compatibility: If it were easy to predict the future, we
would all be millionaires! It seems likely, though, that software and com-
puters will be able to read standard file formats (such as JPEG, TIFF, and
possibly the new DNG) 10 or 15 years from now — maybe not so likely
they’ll be able to read the obscure (and proprietary) raw formats pro-
duced by some digital cameras.
One vital capability — available now — is software that’s compatible
across all digital camera platforms, with no delays between updates for
your digital camera equipment and software.

igital photography costs a lot of money for one that wants to get serious
with the craft. There’s always the latest digital camera to buy, the next
lens in your collection, memory cards, gadgets, and other gizmos. Ah, but
there’s more to contend with that will draw resources from your wallet! 
If you do a lot of printing like I do, you’re constantly running to the
computer store or getting on to the Web to purchase inkjet car-
tridges and photo paper. I figure I’m spending at least a
dollar per 8×10 print, plus a lot more when I’m printing
up to 13×19 inch prints. Printing one series of prints
can get quite expensive — and if you’re not using a
color-managed workflow, your costs can skyrocket.
When adjusting and editing images in Photoshop,
you want to make sure that the images you print on
your printer match exactly the image you’ve been
viewing on your computer’s display. Otherwise,
you’ll be throwing money out the window every time
you make a “test” print that doesn’t match, not to men-
tion the level of aggravation you have to put up with
during the neverending trial-and-error method of printing.
To guarantee your sanity, you need to implement color man-
agement, and forever say goodbye to the expensive trial-and-error
method of printing. As a bonus, you can buy some more of those gizmos with
the money you’ll save in ink and paper.

Coloring Your World
If you talk to digital photographers who have lots of experience shooting
photos, working with Photoshop, and printing their images, you’ll find one
consensus among them: The hardest thing to accomplish in digital photogra-
phy is managing color. When you think about all the steps involved — first
shooting an image with particular light in mind, converting the raw file,
making further adjustments and edits in Photoshop, and then sending the
image to a printer — it’s a miracle that the final print even resembles what
was first envisioned!
One of the most difficult types of images to color manage is portraits. Let’s
face it (sorry about that), we human beings know the color range of skin
tones — and if they’re off just a little, we notice. Figure 3-1 shows a portrait
as seen on a computer monitor and then shown as printed. Managing color
helps you create prints that closely match what the colors should look like.
Figure 3-1: Maintaining the correct skin tone in portraits reinforces the need for color
management.
As seen on the monitor
As printed

Color management is the process of producing images with the correct color,
where color is predictable throughout the image capture, editing, and print-
ing processes:
1. Image capture. This is a fancy way of saying “shooting photos.” Making
color space settings in your digital camera is the first step in your color-
management workflow. Digital cameras actually have settings that deter-
mine the type of color they produce. This setting is known as color
space. Many digital cameras operate in one color space: sRGB. sRGB is a
color space intended for images to be viewed on your computer, not
prints. This doesn’t mean that images from most digital cameras won’t
make good prints; Photoshop will convert the images to any color space
you choose. If your digital camera offers only sRGB as its color space,
don’t worry — you can always convert your files to another color space
such as Adobe RGB (1998) when you open them in Photoshop.
If your camera has the option of setting its color space to something
other than sRGB, set your digital camera to Adobe RGB (1998). Doing so
will ensure that you’re shooting images in the same color space used for
working with photos in Photoshop that are intended for printing.
2. Applying color settings in Photoshop. After you install Photoshop CS2
on your computer, it isn’t exactly “ready to rock.” You’ll have a little
work to do to make sure color settings are applied correctly.
3. Viewing images on your computer monitor. Most of your time is spent
in the digital darkroom, working with images in Photoshop. The most
critical element in implementing color management is calibrating your
monitor. (I discuss that issue further in the “Getting Calibrated” section,
a bit later in this chapter.)
4. Printing. In effect, it’s the final destination for all your efforts — and
printing can be considered an art in itself! During the printing process
(explained in more detail in Chapter 12), color settings need to be pre-
cisely applied by you Photoshoppers (another one of my original techni-
cal terms) out there so that Photoshop is able to properly convert color
that will correctly be applied by the printer when producing prints. 
By applying the color-management processes described in this chapter,
you get your images closer to digital-photography nirvana. Your prints will
look more like what you originally envisioned while shooting your images
and working with them in Photoshop. You’ll save a bunch of time, money,
and sedatives in the process! Color management is your guiding light (no
pun intended) toward total inner peace and visual tranquility. About images,
anyway.

Making Photoshop Color Settings
In addition to making monitor calibration part of your color management
workflow, it’s equally as important to make sure the Photoshop color settings
are correct for the type of images you normally process. If you work with
photographs that are meant for a variety of output methods, you need the
custom color settings in Photoshop. 
You don’t want to expend a lot of energy shooting photos only to have them
turn out wrong when you output your images to print or screen. Managing
color properly can save you the hassle by getting your colors right — so
make color settings the very first stop in your image-editing workflow.
Exploring (color and working) space
Color space is the range of colors available to you for editing your images.
It’s like the colors you used in your old paint-by-numbers set — only instead
of 12 colors, you have millions! Working space is a Photoshop term used
to describe which color space is assigned to an image. You’ll find these
two terms — working space and color space — used interchangeably in
Photoshop. 
CMYK (a working space for press-type printing) and grayscale (used for edit-
ing black-and-white images) are working spaces targeted toward specific pur-
poses. CMYK is defined as a full-color representation of a printing press; the
acronym CMYK defines cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks for the printing
press.
For photographers, the most important working space you use is RGB. Most
of the photographer’s work is geared toward printing on ink jet printers first,
and going to press for magazine, book, or other types of publications (or 
to the Web) second. Digital photographers who incorporate a color-
management workflow opt to use Adobe RGB (1998) first to edit images, 
and then convert to different color spaces if a particular output requires it.
The list that follows explains the differences and different uses of the working
spaces available in Photoshop, while Figure 3-2 shows how using different
color spaces for a photo affect how they look.
 Adobe RGB (1998): This color space is designed to match the color
gamut of inkjet printers. Highly recommended for use with images to be
printed on (well, yeah) inkjet printers.

 sRGB: This color space is designed for displaying photos on computer
monitors, such as Web graphics and Web photos.
 Colormatch RGB: This color space is designed for a color gamut
between sRGB and Adobe RGB (1998). Use for images with multiple pur-
poses and output.
Figure 3-2: Different color spaces affect how color is rendered in an image.
As part of your overall color-management workflow, I recommend always
editing your photographs in the Adobe RGB (1998) color space and saving
that image as a master file. Adobe RGB (1998) provides the widest color
gamut available when it’s time to edit your images. For output destined for
the Web or for special printing, save a copy of your master to an sRGB or
CMYK version of the file for output later. Even while outputting your images
in black and white, I recommend using an RGB color space for your master
image.
Applying Photoshop color settings
In this section, I explain how to specify each setting in the Photoshop Color
Settings window. This is one of the most overlooked steps in color manage-
ment — and it makes a huge difference when used properly. Additionally, I
explain when and how to assign a color profile to an image.
If most of your work involves preparing images for the Web, for printing, or
for publishing, each of those tasks will need a different monitor setting. The
first step after calibrating your monitor (which I show you how to do in the
later section, “Getting Calibrated”) is to set up your default color settings in
Photoshop. Here’s how:

Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
1. Choose Edit➪Color Settings or
press Ctrl+Shift+K (Ô+Shift+K
on the Mac) to bring up the
Color Settings dialog box.
2. Click the More Options button. 
This expands the Color Settings
dialog box so that you can see
all the options, as shown in
Figure 3-3.
3. From the Settings drop-down
list at the top, choose North
America Prepress 2.
The default for Settings is
the North America General
Purpose 2, which isn’t very
good for photographers.
Select North America 
Prepress 2 (as shown in
Figure 3-4); this setting works
best for photographers. 
4. Set the Working Spaces.
Change the Photoshop default
for the RGB working space to
Adobe RGB (1998), as shown
in Figure 3-5. Adobe RGB (1998)
is the best working space for
photographers, providing the
widest color gamut for color sat-
uration. Make sure to leave the
CMYK, Gray, and Spot selections
set at the defaults. 
For most of your image editing,
use Adobe RGB (1998) to edit
your master images. If you need
to, you can convert to the sRGB
working space for the final
output of Web images.
Figure 3-3: The Photoshop Color Settings
dialog box.
Figure 3-4: Changing the Settings to North
America Prepress 2. 

5. Set Color Management Policies.
Make sure to leave RGB, CMYK,
and Gray set to Preserve
Embedded Profiles. This
ensures that color settings are
maintained in images that you
open in Photoshop. 
Leave the three Profile
Mismatches and Missing
Profiles check boxes selected.
These settings ensure that
you’re prompted to choose a
color space to apply when you
open an image in Photoshop
that doesn’t match your default
working space.
6. Set Conversion Options 
settings.
I recommend leaving the
defaults for these settings to
Adobe (Ace) for the Engine
and Relative Colorimetric for
the Intent.
The Engine setting controls Photoshop methods used for converting
colors from one profile to another. The Intent setting specifies what you
want the rendering to accomplish for conversions from one profile to
another. The bottom line? Adobe (ACE) and Relative Colorimetric are
optimal conversion settings for photographs.
For editing photographs in Photoshop, you get the best results by leav-
ing the defaults (Use Black Point Compensation, and Use Dither)
selected. This option ensures the black point of your image matches the 
black point of your print (or output). I normally leave the advanced con-
trols set to their default settings of not selected.
7. Click OK to save your color settings.
In the next section, I show you how to ensure that your color settings
are properly applied to your workflow.

Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
Assigning color profiles
The final step to ensuring a proper
color workflow is to make sure that
the images you open in Photoshop
contain the correct color profile
you’ve set up in the Color Settings
dialog box (see the steps in the 
preceding section). When you
open an image that doesn’t match
that default color space, you’re
prompted with the Embedded
Profile Mismatch dialog box shown
in Figure 3-6.
In this dialog box, you can choose one of three options:
 Use the Embedded Profile: Select this option if you want to leave the
image’s working space as is. 
Remember that if you leave this option selected, you won’t be working
in the default color space you indicated in the Color Settings window.
 Convert Document’s Colors to the Working Space: Select this option if
you want to use your default color space. This is recommended for most
images.
 Discard the Embedded Profile: Select this option if you don’t want to
use a color profile for the image.
Sometimes, when you’re working on an image in Photoshop, you need to con-
vert the image to another working space to get a task done. To get the best
color workflow in a situation like this, first edit your images in Adobe RGB
(1998) and then convert them later to meet your specific output needs. The
combination of using monitor profiles (explained in the next section on cali-
brating your monitor) and assigning color profiles will help ensure an efficient
color-management workflow.
The process to assign color profiles to an image is as follows:
1. Choose Edit➪Assign Profile.
The Assign Profile window
appears.
2. Select the Working RGB option.
Figure 3-7 shows the Working
RGB set to Adobe RGB (1998). 
(Use the Don’t Color Manage
This Document selection only if you might want to submit your images to a
third party, and you don’t know how your images will be color managed.)
Figure 3-6: Setting an image that has the RGB
Working space to Adobe RGB (1998).
Figure 3-7: Assigning a color profile to a
photograph.

3. Select another profile from the
drop-down list provided by the
third option (see Figure 3-8) if
you desire.
This choice is rare for most pho-
tographers, but you can use this
option to assign a specific pro-
file. For example, a printing
company for press services may
have supplied you with a
required profile. You may also
want to convert an existing
image to sRGB if you are going
to save a version of the image
for viewing on the Web, but I
usually use the File➪Save for
Web command for that. 
For most photographs, you want to select the Working RGB option, the
same option I recommend you choose in the Color Settings dialog box as
your default working space. (See the steps in the earlier section,
“Applying Photoshop color settings.”)

The PhotoDisc target image
The PhotoDisc Target image (also called the PDI
test image) comes with a number of color-
management products such as the ColorVision
Spyder 2. It’s also included in the Mac OS. It’s
an industry-standard test image used to give
you a direct view of how accurately the colors
displayed on your monitor match what you
print or prepare for the Web. 
Try using this image as a visual test to compare
what’s on your monitor and what’s actually
coming out of your printer. The image is royalty-
free and can be easily obtained.

Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
Getting Calibrated
As a photographer, you have to visualize the changes you’re making to your
images — and the key component that allows you to do that is your com-
puter monitor. It’s also the only device that stands between the digital
camera and your final print; displaying your images accurately on your moni-
tor is critical. Properly profiling and adjusting — calibrating — your monitor
ensures that what you see is what you’re going to get in your final output of
the image.
The most important step of implementing color management into your work-
flow is to calibrate your monitor. Calibrating on a regular basis is important
because the colors, brightness, and contrast of your monitor change over
time. Whether you use one of those big clunky computer monitors (called
CRTs), one of those sleek new LCD monitors, or a laptop computer, the rule
remains the same: Calibrate on a regular basis.
Most laptop (and some LCD) monitors won’t let you adjust color balance and
contrast; with some of them, only brightness can be adjusted. If you have an
LCD monitor, you should still calibrate to ensure optimal brightness settings.
Calibrating is important to ensure that colors are completely accurate; do as
much of it as you can on your machine.
When you calibrate your monitor, you make adjustments to the brightness,
contrast, and color balance to match what your calibration software uses as
its standard. These adjustments are actual physical changes to the operation
of the monitor (but not to the image files you are viewing). They’re necessary
to produce an accurate profile that your computer then uses to determine
what prints out. 
By calibrating your monitor, you are effectively setting the stage for a suc-
cessful color-managed workflow. If you skip this step, you end up making
adjustments to your digital files on the basis of false information. The result-
ing prints won’t match what you see on your monitor.
Calibrating with Adobe Gamma
Adobe Gamma is a Windows software utility (included with Photoshop CS2)
that you can use to calibrate your monitor and to create a profile that your
computer will use. The Mac version of Adobe Gamma was available with pre-
vious versions of Photoshop and is no longer included with Photoshop CS2.
Instead, Mac users can use the Apple Display Calibrator Assistant found in
the System Preferences folder.

For best results, let your monitor warm up for 30 minutes before you start
any calibration procedure.
To calibrate your monitor using Adobe Gamma, follow these steps:
1. Open the Windows Control
Panel by clicking
Start➪Control Panel.
2. Open the Adobe Gamma
Wizard.
Double-click the Adobe Gamma
icon located in the Windows
Control Panel (shown in
Figure 3-9) to start Gamma.
3. Choose the Step-by-Step (Wizard) version (see Figure 3-10) and then
click Next.
You are asked to choose either the Step By Step (Wizard) method or the
Control Panel method. I recommend choosing the Step By Step method,
as in Figure 3-10; it’s a lot easier.
Figure 3-10: Choose the Step By Step (Wizard) version.
4. Click Load (see Figure 3-11) to choose your monitor type, and then
click Next.

Figure 3-11: Click Load to choose your monitor type instead 
of the default setting.
You are presented with the Open Monitor Profile window.
5. Choose a profile that matches your monitor or one that is similar to it
(see Figure 3-12), and then click Open.
This selection is used only as a starting point for the process. After click-
ing Open, you’re sent back to the Adobe Gamma window shown in
Figure 3-11.
Figure 3-12: Select a Monitor Profile that matches your display
or is a close match. 

Select a profile that best matches the monitor you are using on your
computer by clicking the display type name in the list of profiles shown
in Figure 3-12. If your computer monitor is not listed in the profile list,
you can always choose the default setting provided in the list of profiles.
After your selection, click the Open button and you are sent back to the
Adobe Gamma window shown in Figure 3-11.
6. Type a unique description with a date and then click Next to proceed
to the next window.
The profile you chose in Step 5 doesn’t appear in the Description field.
Don’t worry: The monitor you chose in Step 5 is still associated with the
process. Just type a unique name with a date, such as the name shown
in Figure 3-13.
Figure 3-13: Include a date reference for your description.
7. Adjust brightness and contrast and click Next to continue.
The Adobe Gamma window shown in Figure 3-14 instructs you to use the
contrast adjustment on your monitor and set the contrast to maximum. 
Next, adjust the brightness control until the inside gray square is barely
visible against the black surround. (Keep the lighting in the room as dark
as possible.)
Note that you can click Back at any time to make changes to a previous
screen.

8. Choose the phosphor type for your monitor and then click Next.
If (in Step 5) you chose the type of monitor you’re using, leave this set-
ting as it appears. If you chose the default setting in Step 5, you can
choose Trinitron, as shown in Figure 3-15. If you know the actual phos-
phor values of your monitor, choose Custom and enter those values.
(You can look them up in your monitor’s manual.)

profiles that appear in this step.

9. Adjust gamma settings, and then click Next.
Keeping View Single Gamma Only selected (as shown in Figure 3-16),
move the adjustment slider to the right or left until the center gray box
begins fading into the outer box. This adjustment sets the relative
brightness of your monitor. Make sure to choose Macintosh Default or
Windows Default in the Gamma field. Before clicking Next, deselect the
View Single Gamma Only check box.
10. Adjust red, green, and blue gamma, and then click Next.
In this step, eliminate color imbalances by adjusting each RGB (red,
blue, and green) slider, shown in Figure 3-17, until the color box in the
middle blends in with the outer box.

11. Set the hardware white point (see Figure 3-18) to 6500°K and then
click Next to continue.
Most monitors are set with a native white point of 9300°K. For photogra-
phers, 6500°K provides the cleanest and brightest white point that
matches daylight the closest. 
12. Set the adjusted white point (see Figure 3-19) the same as the hard-
ware white point, and again click Next to continue.
I recommend that you set the adjusted white point to match the hardware
white point. Choosing another setting can result in unpredictable results.
For most applications, you can just leave this set as Same as Hardware.

to 6500°K.

13. View your changes by clicking the Before and After radio buttons;
click Finish.
You have adjusted the brightness, contrast, and color settings of your
monitor to the optimum values. Clicking the Before and After options
shown in Figure 3-20 shows you the difference.
Figure 3-20: Use these options to view how the new adjustments 
look on your monitor.
14. Save your new profile by typing a new profile name in the File Name
field (shown in Figure 3-21), leaving the file type as ICC Profiles; then
click Save to complete the calibration.
This is an important step because — now that you’ve calibrated your
monitor with Adobe Gamma — saving the information into a new moni-
tor profile ensures that your computer and Photoshop CS2 can later use
the profile correctly. 
Keep the existing profiles intact by using a unique profile name you
can easily identify. Make sure you include the date of the profile in
the filename, as shown in Figure 3-21. This identifies your unique
profile with a date so you know the last time you calibrated your 
monitor.

Figure 3-21: Saving the new monitor profile.
Adobe Gamma is a decent tool for calibrating your monitor if you’re a casual
Photoshop user and don’t print a lot of photographs. If you’re more serious
about digital photography and regularly produce prints on a photo-quality
printer, you should strongly consider purchasing a more advanced colorime-
ter and the software to go with it. You’ll get significantly better results with
this equipment, saving time, money, paper, and ink cartridges. The next sec-
tion covers colorimeters and other such advanced calibration tools.
When you calibrate your monitor with Adobe Gamma, a color profile is auto-
matically loaded into your Windows Startup Menu every time you turn on
your computer. If you graduate to a more sophisticated colorimeter and use
it to create a monitor profile for your computer, make sure you delete Adobe
Gamma from your computer’s Startup Menu to prevent Adobe Gamma from
interfering with your new monitor-profile setup.
Calibrating with a colorimeter
The best solution for calibrating your monitor is specialized software used in
conjunction with a colorimeter that reads the actual color values produced by
your monitor. Today’s top monitor-calibration systems include the ColorVision
Spyder2, the ColorVision Color Plus, Monaco Systems MonacoOPTIX, and
Gretag Macbeth Eye-One Display.

Prices for these products vary, but if you are on a
budget, consider the ColorVision Color Plus. This
software-and-colorimeter system offers good 
value for the money for most home systems; Color
Plus provides much more accurate calibration
than Gamma or Colorsync for the Mac. Professional
or serious photographers may opt for the
more high-end ColorVision (shown in Figure 3-22),
Gretag Macbeth, or Monaco products.
Here are some important points to keep in mind
when using a monitor-calibration package to cali-
brate your monitor:
 Colorimeters read color from your monitor
much more accurately than you can when you
look at your monitor; they provide a precise
color profile.
 All the monitor-calibration products mentioned include colorimeters
that attach to LCD monitors as well as to CRTs.
 The software programs are easy to use and provide step-by-step instruc-
tions while performing the calibration of your monitor. Usually the steps
to calibrate your monitor with any of these products aren’t any more dif-
ficult than using Gamma or Colorsync on the Mac.
 Most monitor-calibration solutions automatically remind you to cali-
brate your monitor every few weeks. This is important because monitor
characteristics change over time; if you don’t recalibrate on a regular
basis, your settings start to look like bad science fiction.
 Calibrating your monitor every two to four weeks is recommended.
 Make sure the lights in the room you’re working in are dimmed and the
blinds are closed when you calibrate your monitor. (Lighting candles
and incense can be cool, but keep ’em far enough away from the com-
puter so the particles they give off don’t gum up the works.)
Proofing
After making sure your color settings are correct in Photoshop — and that
you’ve at least calibrated your monitor to give your computer a good profile
to set your display to — you’re ready to get into your color-managed work-
flow. (Part IV provides details of working with images in Photoshop.) While
working with images, it’s important to proof your images to make sure that
what you’re viewing on your monitor closely matches the type of output you
intend for the image.

Proofing in Photoshop is actually a pretty simple process. First, you need to
set up your proofing profile to match the exact output your image is intended
for. When I use the term output, I’m referring to a printer, a specific type of
paper you’re using in the printer, or even output intended for viewing on the
Web or a PDF presentation. Turn on proofing in Photoshop so the image
you’re working in is simulated as viewed on your monitor — and what you’re
seeing closely matches what should be printed. Here’s how:
1. Choose View➪Proof Setup➪Custom. 
2. In the Customize Proof
Condition dialog box that
appears, select the output pro-
file that best simulates the
color on your computer’s dis-
play, and then click OK.
Figure 3-23 shows the
Customized Proof Condition
with the Epson R1800 Printer
Premium Luster paper profile
selected. I chose that selection
because that is the particular
printer and paper combination I
actually use. Your printer and
paper combination will proba-
bly be different. 
3. Toggle Proof Colors on by
choosing View➪Proof Colors or
press Ctrl+Y (Ô+Y on the Mac). 
Selecting the profile doesn’t change your monitor display, which is why
you must perform this step to get the right results. To view the differ-
ence between how your image looks on-screen and how it should look
when printed (or saved as a Web image if you chose sRGB as a profile),
toggle Proof Colors on and off (press Ctrl+Y [Windows] or Ô+Y [Mac] 
to toggle). When Proof Colors is on, the image you’re viewing on the
monitor will closely match what should be printed.

atural-born talent has always been an asset to the best
artists, including photographers. Now that photogra-
phy has transitioned to the technical realm of computers
and software, however, talent alone won’t get photogra-
phers through image management — or reveal how
best to use Camera Raw and Photoshop. What will
get you consistently good results, however, is a little
practice with some of the techniques covered in
the chapters of this book — and repeating them 
till they’re second nature. Doing the same processes
the same way every time reduces the effort 
required; the result is a consistent set of efficient
habits called a workflow.
Workflow is the approach I take to every technique in this
book. It works equally well whether you’re managing images,
using Camera Raw, or making adjustments and editing images in
Photoshop. Okay, a step-by-step approach isn’t rocket science, but if you
stick to the steps that create each workflow — consistently — you’ll notice
improvements in your productivity and in the quality to your photographic
work. Best of all, it isn’t a gadget — workflow doesn’t require you to spend
more money!

64
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
Image Management as a Workflow
It’s a familiar scenario: You go out and shoot some stunning photos and itch
to get back to the digital darkroom so you can work ’em up. You can’t wait to
open Bridge, view what you’ve shot, and process the best ones. Before you
know it, you’ve run a few images through Photoshop, made a few prints, and
then maybe moved on to cruising the Web to check up on your fantasy foot-
ball team, tomorrow’s weather, or your bid on that Elvis coffee mug on eBay.
The downloaded image is forgotten; it sits there . . .
If you’ve been using a digital camera for a while now and take photos fre-
quently, you’ve probably noticed how quickly images pile up on your hard
drive. Every time you download photos from a memory card to your hard
drive, you can be adding hundreds of digital images to an already-crowded
storage space. And they sit there . . . and pile up . . . 
You’ve got potential trouble there. One of the biggest challenges digital pho-
tographers face is coming up with a system to manage all these files. It may
sound about as exciting as watching reruns on TV, but image management
should be exciting to the digital photographer — it means you can actually
find your best work. Read on for helpful tips and a painless workflow that get
you to this worry-free, image-organized state.
Organizing images
The image-management workflow isn’t some industry-standard step-by-step
requirement; it’s yours to create. But don’t panic. As a photographer, you’ll
have your own specific needs for managing images, and each reflects your
work: categories, topics, clients, file formats, and so on, so that’s where you
start. How you organize your images depends (at least in part) on the type of
photography you’re into. A professional portrait photographer, for instance,
may want to organize images by client; a fine-art nature photographer might
organize pictures by topic.
You can — and should — tailor your image management to accommodate the
specific work you do. The best tool for this purpose is a system of organizing
images — creating one, following it consistently, and setting up a standard
workflow for the images moving through it.
Creating an image-management system
Don’t let that pile of miscellaneous images throw you. Implementing an
image-management system starts with two straightforward tasks:
 Planning how you want to organize your images: Here’s where your
knowledge of your photographic work comes into play. A nature photog-
rapher might separate images into categories (say, plants, animals, and
geographic features) or by region (American Southwest, Arctic tundra,
tropical islands . . . ).

 Creating folders to hold the categorized images: Whether you’re using
a Windows computer or a Mac, first create a master folder to contain all
your original, working, and final output images. (I call mine Digital
Images, but you can name it anything you want.) Then create subfolders
within your main images folder — for example, classified by where they
are in their development (working and output images).
Trust me — the shots will keep
coming, so they’d better have a place
to go. I shoot raw images — a lot of
raw images — and I save every one
that’s downloaded to my computer
from my memory card. I’ve planned
my image folders in three basic areas
(shown in Figure 4-1): Original
Images, Working Images, and Output.
I load each memory card into its own
folder. Each “download” is given a
sequential name, such as IMG0001
lake michigan, IMG0002 fall
color, and so on. This system helps
me organize original raw images by
download, in a sequential order,
while noting what’s in the folder. See
Figure 4-2 for an example of setting
up and naming image folders.
Keep your original images original! I
create a Working Images folder that
contains all the images I’m working
on in Photoshop. Whenever I open
an image in Camera Raw, process it,
and then open it in Photoshop, I
immediately save the file as a
Photoshop image (in PSD format) to
one of my Working Images folders. You really can’t mistakenly change a raw
file, but you can a JPEG or TIFF, so by using this practice, you won’t risk alter-
ing an original in any way.
Finding lost treasures while reorganizing
Recently, while using the new Photoshop Bridge feature to migrate images to
new computers and external hard drives (for backups and offline image stor-
age), I decided to go back to my old image files and reorganize them. I had
stored CD after CD of older digital images, along with some of my favorite
35mm slides that I had scanned to digital files. I spent a few evenings viewing
them, printing a few oldies-but-goodies of the family, and adding a few to my
portfolio folder.

Just by viewing and organizing my old images, I discovered some great
photos that I’d never had a chance to process or print — for instance, the
photo of the creek during autumn a few years ago (shown in Figure 4-3).
Figure 4-3: Organize your older images and rediscover good photos.

When organizing your digital photos, don’t forget to include all of the images
you’ve downloaded to your computer in the past. If you had already archived
these files to CD or DVD, take some time to view each disc, and copy the
images that you never worked with before to your working images folder. If
you take the time to review all of your older work, you’ll be surprised how
many gems you’ll find.
Backing up images
One advantage to keeping all your original, working, and output images in a
folder structure (also called a directory tree) is that they’re easy to back up
that way. Yes, you heard me right — back up your images! Digital photogra-
phers work in a digital world, and digital data is vulnerable. We rely on our
computers and hard drives for the well-being of our images — and computers
crash. As manmade things, machines are practically guaranteed to fail at a
certain point. Computer techies like to say, “There are two kinds of people:
Those who have lost all their data, and those that will.”
To protect your images, back them up. The best
method is to copy your image folder directly to a
backup device such as an external hard drive (the
device shown on the left in Figure 4-4). These
devices are becoming very affordable, and easily
attach to your computer via a USB or FireWire
cable. 
Backing up your images to an external hard drive is
a good short-term solution — but you still need to
archive your images to make sure you can access
them over the longer term. Computers today come
standard with CD-writable optical drives (known
casually as burners) that can write to blank CDs easily, storing more than 500
megabytes of data. DVD-writable drives (refer to Figure 4-4) are becoming
popular. Now, a standard compact disc (CD) can store 700MB, but storing one
512-megabyte memory card per CD may be convenient. If archive CDs start to
proliferate, remember: One DVD can store more than 4.5 gigabytes of files.
Whatever type of optical drive you have at your disposal, I strongly recom-
mend that you copy all your original images to a CD or DVD immediately after
you download those images to your computer.
Don’t stop at one copy; make two. One copy should be kept close by, the
other taken to your safety-deposit box (if you have one) or stored in a fire
safe in your home or office. Making two copies of your original images will
help guarantee that you can recover all that work in case your hard drive
crashes, your computer fails, or a meteor lands on the office.

Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
Managing images with Bridge
Bridge serves as your virtual light table, but also allows you to do much more
with your images than view thumbnails. Bridge gives you the tools to get con-
trol of image management before you wind up with a mess on your hard
drive. Integrating Bridge to view and retrieve photos (as shown in Figure 4-5)
makes them a lot easier to keep tidy — especially down the road when you
have accumulated thousands of images on your computer.
As a software program, Bridge doesn’t just sit there showing you row after
row of images, it gives you the tools to manage images by
 Navigating image folders: Use Bridge to view photos that you download.
Use Bridge as your digital light table. You can even create folders — and
copy images between folders — using the Edit menu in Bridge.
 Loading photos into Camera Raw or Photoshop: You can load raw
images directly into Camera Raw just by double-clicking the thumbnails
of the photos in Bridge. If your original images were in TIFF or JPEG
format, your images will load directly into Photoshop.
 Adding information with Metadata: View technical information pro-
vided by your digital camera, and add additional information for each
photo. 
This is your cataloging step in the image-management workflow.
 Applying labels and ratings: Color-code and/or apply ratings to your
photos for easy retrieval later. The idea is to come up with a system of
categorizing your images that makes them easy to find and evaluate.
 Sorting and renaming photos: By adding keywords, labels, and ratings
to your photos, you can easily sort files at a later time.
Protecting your images with quality media
You can purchase blank CDs or DVDs inexpen-
sively now, and great bargains are available at
your local computer or office supply stores.
Whether you’re using CDs or DVDs to archive
your images, be aware that optical discs are not
all alike. CDs and DVDs, like many things, are
available in different levels of quality. 
There are some cheap discs on the market, but
they may be cheap for a reason: They may
scratch easily, or may be susceptible to quicker
chemical deterioration than other discs. When
buying blank CDs
or DVDs to use
for archiving your
images, buy a
name-brand pre-
mium disc (such
as Delkin Archival
Gold or Verbatim
Datalife). These discs are said to hold up for
many years, even decades if they’re carefully
handled and stored.

Figure 4-5: Bridge is your virtual light table.
Managing images with a workflow
Okay, suppose the basics are in place: You keep your images in organized
folders, you back up all your originals, and you’re using Bridge to further
view and organize your files. What keeps all that working well is force of
habit: Following the same procedure — every time you add images to your
collection — is the best way to maintain your images efficiently. So here,
without further ado, is the image-management workflow:
1. Organize your files for image management.
The earlier section, “Organizing images,” shows you how I set up one
folder to store images in my Original, Working, and Output folders. Your
work may dictate different needs for setting up working and output fold-
ers. For instance, if you’re a portrait photographer or shoot commer-
cially, you’ll be setting up separate folders for each of your clients, and
subfolders for the jobs you do for each client.
However you decide to set up your folder tree, always keep your original
files separate from files that you work on in Photoshop. You don’t want to
make a mistake and then save that mistake to your original file.
2. Copy images to your computer.
Using a card reader (or directly connecting your digital camera to your
computer), download your images to your Original Images folder. Get in
69
Chapter 4: Using Workflows to Process Images

70
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
the habit of creating separate folders for each download; create folder
names that follow a numerical order in addition to providing a bit of
information about the images you’re downloading.
3. Back up your files to a backup device and to optical media.
You can never have enough backups. I use external hard drives as both
backup devices and offline storage, but the first thing I do after down-
loading my original images from memory cards is to copy them immedi-
ately to CD or DVD. Use premium optical media so your discs are usable
(as something other than coasters) in the foreseeable future.
Using a laptop in my travels puts a practical limit on how much disk
space I have available. Using an external disk to back up images (and to
store large image libraries) adds extra insurance for my images while
providing convenient offline storage capacity.
4. (Optional) Convert raw images to DNG format.
I’ve recently begun converting my original raw files to Adobe DNG
format as part of my image-management workflow. Though the DNG
format is new and has yet to become a de-facto standard as a raw-image
file format, it’s the best we have right now. 
I’ve also found that converting these raw images to DNG format and copy-
ing the resulting files to CD or DVD gives me a little more protection, a
little better chance that my images will be compatible with image-editing
software in the distant future.
5. Add metadata to the files.
Adding descriptions to your files helps you identify them and provide
practical information about your images for later use. I can look at an
image that’s a couple of years old and still know where I took it, the time
of day, and what camera I used. If I view images that are 5 or 10 years old
(before I developed the metadata habit), I may recognize where I took
the photo, but probably not much else about it. Use Bridge to add
descriptive information to your images. You’ll be glad you did.
6. Apply labels and ratings.
Though you may have hundreds or thousands of images stored and
archived offline, you can still have hundreds or thousands of photos on
your computer that need managing. Bridge’s color coding and rating
functions can help you tell winners from losers in your image collection,
applying color tags or numerical ratings to your images’ metadata.
By following this workflow or modifying it to fit your particular needs, you’ll
be taking a huge step toward making your digital photography better orga-
nized and protected — while saving yourself time in the long run because
your organizing system will prevent unsightly file buildup as your image
library grows. You’ll be able to keep track of those old treasures, and have an
easy way of finding images that you’ve taken, stored, and backed up.

When it comes to managing digital images, I don’t really want to throw a
cheesy cliché at you, but (ack! here it comes) “an ounce of prevention is
worth more than a pound of cure (or, for that matter, cheese).”
Raw Conversion as a Workflow
Okay, suppose you’ve just downloaded and organized a slew of raw images —
either in the native format from your digital camera or converted to the DNG
format. You’ve beaten back the chaos with your image-management work-
flow, all right, but chaos never sleeps. So the next step is to transform the
process of raw conversion into a workflow. Details of using Camera Raw
appear in Chapters 8 and 9; here, however, is the raw-conversion workflow:
1. Open a raw image using Bridge.
Start Bridge by choosing File➪Browse or by clicking the Go to Bridge
button on the Photoshop Option bar. Choose a raw image you want to
process by double-clicking the thumbnail of the image (or you can right-
click the image and choose Open with Camera Raw from the flyout
menu). Figure 4-6 shows the image loaded in the Camera Raw window. 
Figure 4-6: The Camera Raw window.
The red indicates highlight clipping.
71
Chapter 4: Using Workflows to Process Images

72
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
2. Click the Shadows and Highlights check boxes (next to the Preview
check box) to turn on the clipping warnings.
Keeping these two check boxes checked is a good habit to develop:
They call your attention to the parts of your image where shadow and
highlight areas of the image are being clipped — that is, losing usable
image data due to under- or overadjustment to exposure, shadows, or
brightness. Such warnings help you adjust the image in Camera Raw.
When the Shadows and Highlights check boxes are checked, clipped
shadow areas of the image show up in blue; highlight clipping is indi-
cated in red, as shown in the portion of the sky in Figure 4-6. 
3. Turn on Auto Adjustments.
CS2 brings us a new feature, Auto Adjustments in Camera Raw. If you use
it, Camera Raw automatically adjusts color and tone to what it considers
optimum for the image. Honestly, Auto Adjustments works pretty well.
You just press Ctrl+U on a Windows computer or Ô+U on a Mac, and
you’ve got a good start in making adjustments. I use it when I first open
raw images in Camera Raw.
4. Make overall tonal and color
adjustments in the Adjust tab
(see Figure 4-7).
When you open an image in
Camera Raw, the Adjust tab is
automatically selected. The
Adjust tab contains all the con-
trols you’ll use to adjust White
Balance, Temperature, Tint,
Exposure, Shadows, Brightness,
Contrast, and Saturation. Using
Auto Adjustments in Step 3 will
automatically assign values to
Exposure, Shadows, Brightness,
and Contrast — but you don’t
have to settle for the automatic
settings. You can tweak till you
get the result you want. (You’ll
have to set White Balance, Tint,
and Saturation on your own;
Camera Raw leaves those adjust-
ments to the photographer.)
Figure 4-7: The Adjust tab contains controls
for overall adjustments.

5. Apply sharpness and 
luminance/color noise 
adjustments (see Figure 4-8).
The Camera Raw Detail tab
(shown in Figure 4-8) offers
three controls for applying
sharpness and noise reduction
to both the luminance and the
color of the image. Okay, what
does that techno-babble really
mean? Simply that you can
sharpen the outlines of the
image, and reduce those tiny
messy bits in the grayscale
areas, and get rid of the color-
speckle thingies that show up in
the color areas of the image.
Both are referred to as noise.
The Luminance Smoothing
slider is sheer death to
grayscale noise, while the Color
Noise Reduction slider is a hefty
weapon against the color noise
that can plague images shot in
high-ISO settings or long expo-
sures.
Reducing luminance and color noise during the raw conversion work-
flow should be your preferred method for handling noise. Though
Photoshop CS2 offers the new Reduce Noise filter, the goal is to be able
to make as many adjustments as possible before you open images in
Photoshop.
Save the sharpening of any image for the very last steps in your image-
processing workflow. Use the Sharpness adjustment only for previewing
images in Camera Raw. (There’s more about sharpening images in
Chapter 12; you might want to review it when preparing images for
output.)
You can set Camera Raw Preferences to limit the application of sharpen-
ing to Preview Only. (I show you how to set Camera Raw Preferences in
Chapter 9.)
73
Chapter 4: Using Workflows to Process Images
Figure 4-8: The Detail tab contains controls for
sharpness and noise reduction.

74
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
6. Fine-tune the tonality and con-
trast, using the Curve tab.
The Curve tab (shown in Figure
4-9) lets you fine-tune an image’s
color characteristics (tonality).
Unlike the Curves adjustment in
Photoshop, the Camera Raw
Curves adjustment works on
top of the adjustments made in
the Adjust tab; it works like an
adjustment’s own “fine-tuning.” I
find that making careful changes
in the Adjust tab reduces any
need to make changes in the
Curve tab.
Though most of your tonal
adjustments should be made
using the Adjust tab, try using
the Curve tab’s Tone Curve
selection box to view your
image using the Medium
Contrast and Strong Contrast
preset adjustment. If you don’t
like the results of either, you can always leave the Curve adjustment set
to its default (Linear).
7. Click Open to open the image in Photoshop CS2. 
You can also click Done, but that will just save the Camera Raw settings
for that image you’ve just made, and then take you back to Bridge.
Clicking the Save button will allow you to save the raw file (and its side-
car file with your adjustments) to a folder of your choosing. You can also
specify another format for the file — raw, DNG, TIFF, JPEG, or PSD — but
for the most part, you’ll be opening the image in Photoshop for overall
correction and image editing.
You may have noticed I didn’t include the Lens or Calibrate tabs in the
Camera Raw workflow described here. That’s because normally these con-
trols are used sparingly; you won’t need them for most of your images. (Even
so, I cover those tabs and their controls in Chapter 9.)
Correcting Images in Photoshop as a Workflow
I’ve found that the more practice I got making adjustments in Camera Raw,
the fewer corrections I had to make in Photoshop. Better still, accurately
adjusting white balance, exposure, shadows, brightness, contrast, and color
Figure 4-9: The Curve tab.

saturation in Camera Raw isn’t destructive. Making those same adjustments
in Photoshop can destroy valuable image data that might affect the quality of
my images, especially if I print them larger than 8×10 inches.
Unfortunately, not all images can be adjusted in Camera Raw — only (well,
yeah) the raw ones! Let’s not forget all those JPEGs and TIFFs that we shot in
our misspent youth, or perhaps are even still producing. (Okay, I admit it: My
everyday compact camera doesn’t have raw as an option — only JPEG — and
I take photos with that Nikon 7900 almost every day!)
But we can still make the best of the
images we have. Behold: For fine-
tuning images processed in Camera
Raw — or photos shot originally in
JPEG or TIFF format (such as the one
in Figure 4-10) — I offer the
Photoshop image-correction workflow
(applause, please!):
1. Open the image in Photoshop
and evaluate the image to
determine your plan of attack. 
Does the image show an overall
color cast (too blue, magenta,
yellow, and so on)? Is the image
too light or too dark? Do you
want to increase the contrast?
Do you want to add color satu-
ration? Take a few moments to
visualize how you want your
image to appear; it’ll help you
determine which adjustments
belong in the workflow.
2. Create a Levels adjustment
layer to correct color. 
Use this layer to adjust the amount of color in each of the Red, Green,
and Blue channels, using these levels to compensate for incorrect color.
You can change the saturation or lightness for individual colors, or the
entire color range at once (RGB). If you’re just getting used to adjusting
levels, simply make an overall correction in the combined RGB channel.
I show you how to create adjustment layers in Chapter 10.
3. Create a Curves adjustment layer to make finer color level adjustments.
Experiment with slight adjustments across the tonal range of the image.
You can, for example, use the Curves adjustment layer to adjust the con-
trast of the image — avoiding the Brightness/Contrast adjustment
(which is a more destructive way to adjust contrast).
75
Chapter 4: Using Workflows to Process Images

waiting to be adjusted!

76
Part I: Getting Your Feet Wet 
4. Punch up the color in your image using the Hue/Saturation adjust-
ment layer. 
As with Saturation adjustment in Camera Raw, you can move the
Saturation slider to the right to increase the amount of color in your
image. Figure 4-11 shows the adjusted image; the Layers palette shows
adjustment layers created for Levels, Curves, and Hue/Saturation.
Figure 4-11: The adjusted image (and its adjustment layers) after image 
correction.

Consistently following the same steps — turning them into a familiar work-
flow — as you make overall adjustments to images in Photoshop can vastly
increase your efficiency — especially when you make those corrections in
separate layers. Down the road, you can go in and change individual adjust-
ments as needed instead of having to redo the entire image.
When you’re making overall adjustments to your image, less is more. For
many images, slight adjustments do the trick. Overdoing it can make your
photos look fake and unrealistic.
Editing Images as a Workflow
Making adjustments to your images is a start, but editing images can involve
a lot of small, specific changes to certain pixels — for example, removing red-
eye, erasing chewing-gum wrappers or soda cans from the grass in a nature
photo, or even making somebody’s nose look twice as big (which can be fun,
but be careful not to insult anyone!). Nailing down one procedure to handle
image editing can seem as complex as mapping out an entire step-by-step
process for life — it may sound impossible. Not so. Here are some basic steps
to help you reinforce best practices; they make up your image-editing work-
flow, and they look like this:
1. After you finish your overall adjustments in Photoshop, create a new
layer and combine the previous layers into the new layer by pressing
Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E (Ô+Shift+Option+E on the Mac).
2. For each edit you make, create a separate layer.
Creating separate layers for each edit enables you to go back to just that
edit and remove or change it.
3. Name each layer.
Click the layer name in the Layers palette and type the new name for the
layer. Name the layer to indicate the type of edit made using that layer,
(for example, Healing Brush, Dodge, Burn, Black-and-White, or Red-
Eye Removal).
4. Save the file in your Working Images folder.
After the overall adjustments and image edits are made to the file,
you’ve created many layers. Save the image by choosing File➪Save As
and save the file in PSD (Photoshop) format. Saving the file in Photoshop
format preserves the adjustments and edits you’ve made in layers.
Saving the file in your Working Images folder is a good standard image-
management practice.
77

By practicing these five basic steps for each edit, you’ll find that your files
will be more organized, making it easier to track changes for editing at a later
time. (Handy if you get the itch to change your changes.)
Figure 4-12 shows the same image used to illustrate the image-correction
workflow, with some new edits (courtesy of the image-editing workflow): I’ve
added layers to provide selective blur (one of my favorite effects), and to
clean up some spots using the Spot Healing Brush.
Figure 4-12: Create layers to add edits to an image.

Reviewing Workflows
As you use this book as a reference for converting raw images and using
many Photoshop features to adjust and edit your images, use the workflows
described in this chapter as your roadmap. Repetitive processes that use
best practices create good habits, make you more efficient, and consistently
boost the quality of your photos.

Workﬂow with

In this part . . .
A
s you know, digital cameras offer photogra-
phers a huge advantage over ﬁlm: You can
shoot and shoot while reusing the same memory
cards. You don’t have to buy ﬁlm anymore, just
carry enough memory cards to do the job. On
the ﬂipside of all that uninhibited shooting at a
greatly reduced cost, what are you to do with all
those digital image ﬁles? The answer (drum roll,
please): Organize your best practices into an
image-management workﬂow with Adobe Bridge.
This part shows you how.
If you want to avoid the nightmare of shooting
more images than you can handle in Photoshop,
Chapters 6 and 7 can help you make sense of it all.
I show you how to set up folders to store your
original images, and how to keep them separate
from the images you’re working on. Next, I show
you around Bridge, introduce you to all its most
useful functions, and apply those to managing
your growing number of images. Organizing your
images (and knowing how to take advantage of
all the features Bridge offers the photographer)
enables you to manage your images like a pro!

efore digital photography, I would view my 35mm slides on a light table.
I’d carefully take them out of their protective sleeves and view them a
few at a time with a loupe (a little magnifying glass). Keepers went
in one slide file, the rest were relegated to the other file. If it
sounds archaic, it is, but that’s how we viewed photos and
organized them back then — with a light table and a file
cabinet.
The timing couldn’t have been more perfect when
Adobe first offered the file browser in Photoshop 7,
which has evolved into Bridge with the release of
CS2. Now, working with thousands of digital files, I
can use Bridge for almost all of my image manage-
ment — including viewing my images on my virtual
light table, the computer monitor. Many of my best
practices from pre-digital days were easy to adapt. This
book stresses the need for an image-management work-
flow, and Bridge is your tool for managing your increasing
horde of digital images.

84
Part II: Image-Management Workflow with Adobe Bridge 
Introducing Bridge
Bridge is a standalone application that can be started in Windows or on the
Mac independently of Photoshop. If you’re running other software in the
Adobe Creative Suite such as Illustrator or GoLive, you can use Bridge to
manage files for all of them, including Photoshop — so it serves (aha!) as a
bridge between them. You can use Bridge to perform quite a range of tasks as
you organize your photos — including these:
 Browse your computer for images: First and foremost, Bridge is a great
image-browsing program. You can easily navigate all the hard drives and
folders in your system for images. Figure 5-1 shows the Bridge window
with a thumbnail selected.
Figure 5-1: The Bridge window. 
 Open images directly into Camera Raw or Photoshop: Bridge serves as
file menu for both Camera Raw and Photoshop. Double-clicking raw-
image thumbnails in Bridge will automatically open images in Camera
Raw. If the image selected is another file format (such as JPEG, TIFF, or
PSD), the image will be loaded directly into Photoshop.
If you have other raw converters loaded on your computer, double-
clicking raw-image thumbnails might open your images in one of those
other raw converters instead of Camera Raw. You can always click an
image and then press Ctrl+R (Ô+R on a Mac) to open an image in
Camera Raw.

 Add metadata to images: For my commercial work, one of the first things
I do when first viewing a fresh download of images is to add metadata to
each image — data about data (in this case, about images) that helps me
organize the files. Your digital camera provides some metadata — for
example, the date and shooting information such as shutter speed, aper-
ture, and ISO setting. You can add more metadata in Bridge (say, copyright
information and a text description of the photo).
Metadata information is stored in a sidecar file kept with your images.
Whether you’re viewing thumbnails in Bridge or editing photos in
Photoshop, that metadata is retained. If you’re using DNG format (which
I discuss further in Chapter 2), metadata is stored directly in the image
file (no sidecar file).
 Add ratings and color labels to images: One cool feature of Bridge is
the convenient way to rate, rank, and label your images. You can indi-
cate a rating to an image of one to five stars and even apply a color code
to an image. Both ratings and color labels are good tools to use in con-
junction with Bridge’s image search features, which allows you to search
for images based on ratings and labels.
 Rename a bunch of images at once: Bridge offers the ability to batch
and rename images, giving you the choice to both rename those images
and then store the renamed images in a folder of your choosing. This
feature comes in handy when you have a number of images you’ll want
to send to a client (or a friend for that matter), but don’t want to use the
same filename for the images that your digital camera provides. 
 Choose workspaces: Depending on what you’re doing with your images,
you can use Bridge to switch between workspaces — different working
views of Bridge. If, for example, you’re creating a filmstrip-style presenta-
tion, you can use the Filmstrip workspace shown in Figure 5-2. For other
tasks, you can change workspaces easily by choosing Window➪
Workspace (or by clicking the Workspace icons in the lower-right corner
of the Bridge window).
 Run Photoshop automation features from Bridge: These automatic fea-
tures that can be run directly from Bridge include creating a PDF presen-
tation, creating a Web photo gallery, and stitching together panoramas
(using Photomerge). But the crown jewel of these features is the power-
ful and time-saving Image Processor, where you can batch-convert any
number of images from one format to another while choosing a separate
destination folder for those files.
With all the image-management functions that Bridge offers the photogra-
pher, it’s worth taking some time to get to know. If you read up on using its
features, play around with it some, and fit it into your workflow; you’ll save a
lot of time in the long run, and your images will be a lot better managed and
organized. Just as Windows or Mac OS is the operating system for your com-
puter, consider Bridge the operating system for your images and Photoshop.

Getting Acquainted with Bridge
The Bridge window is the gateway to where all the goodies are, but there’s
one immediate piece of business to take care of: How do you start Bridge?
(Oh yeah, that . . . ) There are actually three ways to fire it up:
 Start Bridge from your computer. 
Bridge is an independent software program just like Word, Excel, or
Photoshop. From a computer running Windows, choose Start➪Adobe
Bridge. From the Mac Desktop, double-click the Bridge icon
(Applications➪Adobe Bridge).
You can start Bridge by pressing Ctrl+Alt+O (Windows) or Ô+Option+O
(on the Mac).
 Start Bridge from the Photoshop File menu.
From Photoshop CS2, simply choose File➪Browse shown in Figure 5-3.
 Start Bridge from the Go to Bridge button.
From Photoshop, just click the Go to Bridge button on the Option bar
shown in Figure 5-3.

Figure 5-3: Starting Bridge from the File menu or the Go to Bridge button. 
Getting the lay of the land
Bridge is indeed a powerful standalone program — complete with menus,
tabs, work areas, and a range of specialized views to fit your work. Before you
jump into the details of how to manage images, however, take a look at the
components of the Bridge work area shown in Figure 5-4:
 Menu bar: Contains Bridge commands within the File, Edit, Tools, Label,
View, Window, and Help menus. Just about everything you want to do in
Bridge is found in these menus; I sum up those commands in the next
section.
 Option bar: Contains the Look In menu, Go Up a Folder, the

Would you like to see a menu?
As with any typical Windows or Mac program, Bridge comes equipped with a
full set of menus — offering just about every function you’ll want to perform
(except maybe brewing coffee). For example, if you want to open an image,
click the thumbnail, choose File➪Open, and voilà!
You could also just double-click the thumbnail to open the document. Often
you have many ways to perform the same or similar functions in Bridge —
and, for that matter, in Photoshop. The functions you choose from other
parts of Bridge can also be found in the menus:
 File menu: If you’re used to
working with Windows or Mac
programs, the File menu should
be familiar to you. Shown in
Figure 5-5, the File menu is
where you can open a new
Bridge window, create a folder,
open a file or choose which pro-
gram to open it in, close Bridge,
or send a file to the Recycle
Bin/Trash. You can also add
information about the file (meta-
data) to an image via the File
Info command.
 Edit menu: I’m a frequent visi-
tor to the Edit menu (see Figure
5-6), mainly because that’s
where the Undo command is.
Sure, the Bridge menus show
you the keyboard shortcuts, but
for casual users, using the
menus is easier than memoriz-
ing all those keyboard com-
mands, such as Undo Ctrl+Z
(Ô+Z on the Mac). You’ll also
find the familiar Cut, Copy, and
Paste commands here in the
Edit menu. 
One command I use frequently
is Apply Camera Raw Settings.
It copies the exact Camera Raw
settings made to one image
and applies them to multiple images — a great timesaver! (There’s more
about that technique in Chapter 6.)

Chapter 5: Getting Around, Across, Under, and Over Adobe Bridge 
Figure 5-5: The Bridge File menu. 
Figure 5-6: The Edit menu. 

90
Part II: Image-Management Workflow with Adobe Bridge 
An especially nifty Edit menu command that I use often is Duplicate
(Ctrl+D [Windows] or Ô+D [Mac]). Using it, you can easily make an
exact copy of an image — handy for creating more than one version to
work on at the same time. The Duplicate command is also the very thing
when you want to create a “working” version of an image while leaving
the original in pristine, untouched condition. Bridge automatically adds
copy to the filename of the newly created duplicate.
 Tools menu: The Tools menu
(shown in Figure 5-7) is home to
many of the Bridge and
Photoshop automation features.
Batch Rename (for example) is a
huge timesaver — you can reuse
it to rename any number of files
you’ve selected in the Content
area, and save those files to
another folder. And the
Photoshop Services command
links you to Web resources
where you can upload your
images to have them printed —
as proofs, or in book, calendar, or greeting-card format.
Choosing the Photoshop command will take you to Photoshop’s automa-
tion features, including:
• Batch: Run Photoshop Actions on any number of images selected
in the Content area.
• Contact Sheet II: I’m sure you’re curious to what happened to
Contact Sheet I, but I’m sure II is better! Here’s where you can
select any number of images in the Content area, and almost
instantly create contact sheets from those images.
• Image Processor: Yet another great timesaver! If you want to con-
vert a number of images from one format to another (say, PSD to
JPEG), the Image Processor is the Photoshop automation tool for
you.
• Merge to HDR: Using this new feature in Photoshop CS2, you can
merge a number of images into one HDR (high dynamic range)
image. It’s an advanced command that can be a powerful tech-
nique. Combining different versions of a same image, taken at dif-
ferent exposures, can help you compensate for difficult lighting
situations. Merging underexposed and overexposed versions of an
image together (using Merge to HDR) would give you a single image
from two or three — maybe with striking results!
Figure 5-7: The Tools menu. 

• PDF Presentation: After selecting images in the Content area, use
PDF Presentation to create presentations of those images that you
can post to a Web site or e-mail to friends, family, or clients.
• Photomerge: Stitching together images to create panoramas is
easy using Photomerge. I show you that feature in more detail in
Chapter 13.
• Picture Package: If you remember school pictures from back in the
day, or currently have your own kids in school, Picture Package is
where you can create your own 8×10-inch print; it includes various
sizes of your chosen photos.
• Web Photo Gallery: This is one of my favorite automation features
of Photoshop. Quickly and easily create your own photo Web site.
As a guy who’s developed many Web sites over the years, I can tell
you this utility really works well! You can choose a Web site tem-
plate, select photos to display by selecting thumbnails in Bridge, and
there’s your gallery. Hey, it’s so easy — and this Web site doesn’t
even have to send development offshore to be completed! Using
Web Photo Gallery is a no-brainer way to share, admire, or just
show off your photos.
 Label menu (see Figure 5-8): The Label menu
provides all the options for applying ratings
and labels to images. (I show you how to use
these features in Chapter 6.)
 The View menu: The View menu is where you
find the options that control how Bridge dis-
plays itself on-screen. The commands to dis-
play your thumbnails in Thumbnail, Filmstrip,
or Details mode are in this menu as well. You
can also sort your thumbnails or show only
certain types of images (such as all files,
graphic files, or Camera Raw files only) by
using this menu. 
One neat feature I recently discovered while
playing with the View menu is Slide Show
(Ctrl+L, Ô+L on a Mac). Starting Slide Show
allows you to view your thumbnails in full-
screen mode (as in Figure 5-9). Slide Show can
be another way to view and evaluate images
in Bridge, or simply to show off some cool
photos on your computer.

Figure 5-9: The Label menu and Slide Show. 
 Window menu: The Window menu contains all the different workspaces
(different views of Bridge; see Figure 5-10) that you can choose while
working in Bridge. Let’s face it — digital photographers have different
personal tastes when it comes to working in Bridge and Photoshop; the
Window menu accommodates them by letting you specify different
working conditions:
• Default (Ctrl+F1, Ô+F1 on a Mac): The Default workspace provides
the best of everything Bridge has to provide. The Favorites,
Folders, Preview, Metadata, and Keywords panels are displayed
along with thumbnails.
• Lightbox (Ctrl+F2, Ô+F2 on a Mac): The Lightbox workspace
changes your Bridge view to Thumbnails only. You still have
access to all Bridge menus, but the panels are gone.
• File Navigator (Ctrl+F3, Ô+F3 on a Mac): The File Navigator work-
space shows you thumbnails in the Content area and the Favorites
and Folders panel. This view allows you to view thumbnails in fold-
ers that you can navigate in the Folders panel. 
• Metadata Focus (Ctrl+F4, Ô+F4 on a Mac): The Metadata Focus
workspace presents Bridge with a smaller thumbnail view with the
Favorites, Metadata, and Keyword panels displayed.
• Filmstrip Focus (Ctrl+F5, Ô+F5 on a Mac): The Filmstrip Focus
workspace provides a thumbnail view of your images, with a larger
preview of a selected image in the main portion of the Content
area. No panels are displayed.

Figure 5-10: The Window menu. 
 Help menu: The Bridge Help
menu gives you links to
Photoshop’s updated Help 
program, and the convenient
Updates command. Bridge
doesn’t really have its own
help section, but Bridge Help
(F1) does link you directly to 
the Bridge section of the
Photoshop Help application
(shown in Figure 5-11).
The Updates command in the Bridge
Help menu links you directly to the
Adobe Photoshop updates area of
adobe.com. This useful feature makes getting software updates for
Photoshop, Bridge, and Camera Raw easy. I recommend checking for updates
every month.

Part II: Image-Management Workflow with Adobe Bridge 
Using Bridge panels
Located below the menus and Option bar is the panel area. The default work-
space of Bridge will show the Favorites, Folders, Preview, Metadata, and
Keywords panels. Each panel has a specific function:
 The Favorites panel: The Favorites panel
shares the same space in Bridge as the
Folders panel. Shown in Figure 5-12, Favorites
is an “area” browser. Instead of rummaging
around in one folder at a time, you can
browse specific areas — say, your computer,
Adobe Stock Photos (Adobe’s new stock-
photo service), Version Cue, and Collections.
(I show you how to customize Favorites in the
next section, “Customizing Bridge.”)
The Favorites panel saves you time by letting
you just drag a folder in from the Content area
when you want to create a Favorites shortcut.
If you work mainly from a few image folders,
you simply click My Computer, find the folder
you want to drag to the Favorites panel, and
drag it. Finding that folder becomes a lot
easier as you work in Bridge (or when you
first start it up) — not a drag at all.
 The Folders panel (see Figure 5-13): As a user
of multiple image folders, I rely on the Folders
panel to navigate — and it’s where I manage
the folders on my computer. Similar to
Windows Explorer, the Folders panel lets you
click through drives and folders or move them
around by or dragging them to other folders
or drives.
You can make just as many mistakes in the Folders panel as you can in
Windows Explorer. Be careful when you move folders around, or send
folders or files to the Recycle Bin or Trash. You can inadvertently
delete folders and files you want to keep.
 The Preview panel: The Preview panel displays an image that is
selected in the work area. Right-click (Ô+click a Mac) to show the pre-
view image (and all the options shown in Figure 5-14) on-screen, much
the same as when you preview an image in the work area.
Figure 5-12: Favorites panel. 
Figure 5-13: Folders panel. 

Figure 5-14: Preview panel. 
 The Metadata panel: You can
view information about a select-
ed image in the Metadata panel.
Figure 5-15 shows basic image
metadata, but you can also add
EXIF information (data your dig-
ital camera saves with the image
— aperture, shutter speed, ISO,
and such) and other important
professional tidbits such as
copyright.
The IPTC section is the place to
add copyright and other infor-
mation (for instance, more
about the photographer and
the images) following IPTC stan-
dards. If you’re wondering who
the heck the IPTC is, it’s a
London-based press-and-telecommunications organization that sets
standards for news-media data. You can check out this organization at
www.iptc.org.

Figure 5-15: Metadata panel.

96
Part II: Image-Management Workflow with Adobe Bridge 
 The Keywords panel: A good
image management process that
I recommend in Chapter 6 is
adding keywords to your images
using the Keywords panel. (I
guess I’m recommending it here,
too.) Adding keywords to your
images makes all the difference
when you’re organizing them (or
searching for them later).
Getting in the habit of associat-
ing keywords with images 
gives you a powerful image-
management tool; you’ll thank
yourself in the future.
Figure 5-16 shows a keyword
I’ve added to indicate where the
selected image was taken.
Customizing Bridge
One of my favorite things about Photoshop and Bridge is that they let me
easily customize my view of the software. Sure, a lot of computer programs
let you add toolbars, change fonts, or fluff the cosmetics, but when you’re
crafting an image, you may want to change the look of Bridge entirely to fit
the work in hand.
Bridge gives you power over how it’s displayed when you choose and tweak
your workspaces. Many programs don’t let you customize panels and work
areas, but Adobe has gone out of its way to make Bridge customizable to fit
your tastes or needs. Changing the background color of the work area is kind
of cool (your only choices are black, white, and grayscale); you can put a lot
of detailed information in metadata — and manage it with Bridge — or even
specify which metadata fields are viewable. Bridge is a tweaker’s paradise;
you may not use even a fraction of the options, but you have ’em if you need
’em. If the designers and developers at Adobe wanted to ease the artist’s
mind, well — congratulations on a job well done!
Changing workspaces and views
Photographers can be picky; I guess it’s the nature of an artist who demands
perfection down to the slightest detail. Bridge workspaces and views offer
enough options to reasonably satisfy the most discerning taste. (Okay, maybe
most digital photographers don’t really get that finicky about Bridge work-
spaces, but having options sure is nice!)
Figure 5-16: Keywords panel.

This list highlights some of the ways you can change the way Bridge and its
sections appear:
 Change your workspace: The Window menu offers a useful range of
workspaces, but the one I use most is the default, shown in Figure 5-17.
It includes the Favorites/Folders section, a small preview, Metadata, and
Keywords panels — everything I need for my work.

Part II: Image-Management Workflow with Adobe Bridge 
 Resize panels and the Content area: You can
easily resize your panels and the size of the
Content area by dragging the borders (refer to
Figure 5-17).
 Resize the Bridge window: In the bottom-
right area of the Bridge window, you can drag
the corner to resize the entire Bridge window
(unless you’ve maximized it already by click-
ing the Maximize button in the upper-right
corner of the window).
 Change to Filmstrip view: If you like the default
workspace (the way I do) but you’d rather look
at your thumbnails in Filmstrip view shown in
Figure 5-18, click the Filmstrip view button at
the bottom-right of the Bridge window.
 Change to Details view: If you’re comparing
and analyzing your images, you’ll want to view
them with more image data displayed. The
Details view provides a view of each image in
the work area, showing more file properties
than are displayed in the other views.
 Change to the Versions and Alternates view.
If you’re working with images in Version Cue,
you can use this view to compare the different
versions or alternatives that were created.
Changing Bridge preferences
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to
your computer, there’s more customization to do!
Bridge gives you some detailed options for changing
window colors and specifying which metadata fields
to display with thumbnails. To change Bridge preferences, follow these steps:
1. Start Preferences by choosing
Edit➪Preferences, or press
Ctrl+K (Ô+K on a Mac).
The Preferences window gives
you various ways (in the left
column) to modify your prefer-
ence settings: General,
Metadata, Labels, File Type
Associations, Advanced, and
Adobe Stock Photos. The default
choice is General Preferences,
shown in Figure 5-19.
Figure 5-18: Filmstrip, Details,
and Versions and Alternates
views. 
Figure 5-19: The General Preferences window.

2. Change the Content area background to black, white, or gray.
One cosmetic change you can make to Bridge is to change the back-
ground of the Content area. You can’t specify a color, but you can use
the Background slider in the Thumbnails section to adjust from black
(at left) all the way to the right for white.
A neutral gray background is actually best for viewing image 
thumbnails — and that’s true whether you’re viewing images in
Photoshop, Bridge, or even prints on your desk. Your eyes can
best judge colors without the interference of a white, black, or color
background. For most images, leave the background of the Content
area gray.
3. Modify information to be displayed under thumbnails.
By default, thumbnails appear with the filename, date/time the image
was taken, image dimensions, and keywords. Figure 5-20 shows a fourth
line change to show copyright information, which I specified using
Additional Lines of Thumbnail Metadata in the third selection box.
Figure 5-20: Changing thumbnail-image information
in Preferences.
4. Customize Favorites.
Remember the Favorites Panel? You can specify the areas of your com-
puter that appear in Favorites by selecting what you want in the Favorite
Items area of Preferences. Figure 5-21 shows how selected Favorite Items
appear on-screen in the Favorites panel.
99
Chapter 5: Getting Around, Across, Under, and Over Adobe Bridge 

100
Part II: Image-Management Workflow with Adobe Bridge 
Figure 5-21: Changing what’s displayed in the Favorites panel.
5. Customize Metadata Preferences.
Click Metadata in the Preferences window to show the available meta-
data selections. There you can select and deselect the metadata fields
you want to appear in the Metadata panel.
Review that slew of metadata default fields carefully. Decide which fields
you will and won’t be using — and then select or deselect them accord-
ingly in Metadata Preferences (shown in Figure 5-22).
Figure 5-22: Changing what’s displayed in the Metadata panel.

6. Modify Label definitions.
Chapter 6 shows you how to apply color labels to your images, but you
can customize the descriptions of your color labels in the Labels section
of Preferences (shown in Figure 5-23). The default for each color label is
simply the color name, but you can customize these names any time you
want to fit your own labeling system. Knock yourself out!
Figure 5-23: Changing what’s displayed in the Metadata panel.
7. Modify File Type associations.
You may want to leave this section of Preferences as is. Though you can
change the software programs associated with file types, why do that if
you’re happy with the way things are working on your computer? You’re
unlikely to need this section unless something unusual is going on. For
example, if your JPEGs are opening automatically in Word instead of
Photoshop, you can change that setting here.
8. Change miscellaneous settings.
The Advanced preferences are further ways to customize how Bridge
works. You can set the largest file you’ll let Bridge open, how many
recently viewed folders the Look In pop-up shows you, and whether to
use double-clicking to edit Camera Raw settings. I tend to leave these
settings alone, but some are like parachutes: When you need them, noth-
ing else does the job. For example, if you work with Bridge in a language
other than English, you can select from many languages by clicking the
Language selection box shown in Figure 5-24.

I
f you went through Chapter 5, you got a look at how powerful Bridge is for
working with images. I’ve been using only Bridge — ever since it was in
beta — to manage my images, until now it’s my primary tool for keeping my
ever-growing image library under control. Windows Explorer used to be my
tool of choice for organizing and managing my images; for one who’s
been using Windows for more than a dozen years, it took a 
program like Bridge to get me to break old habits.
If you’re new to digital cameras and Photoshop, you may
have only a few hundred photos to manage. So far. But if
you take a few weeks’ vacation to that exotic island
you’ve always dreamed about (and if you do, congrat-
ulations!), you could come home with hundreds more
digital images. Those images add up quick — and can
fill up your hard drive in a hurry. Solution: Manage
your images with Bridge. Then go take a vacation! 
Managing Images with Bridge
In Chapter 5, I show you just about every menu, command,
panel, and change to workspaces and preferences to Bridge, now it’s
time to put this software to work managing images. As with every process
covered in this book, I take the same approach: setting up and using a work-
flow (in fact, the same one mentioned in Chapter 4) for image management.
Here’s the image-management workflow you can implement with Bridge, step
by step:

104
Part II: Image-Management Workflow with Adobe Bridge 
1. Navigate and create image folders.
You can view photos that you download directly from your digital
camera or card reader. This is a lot better than the old light tables that
used to be used to view those little negatives and slides.
2. Organize images.
Organize your images into Original, Working, and Output folders. Use the
Folders panel and the Edit menu (Copy and Paste commands) to move
images into their designated folders — or drag and drop images from
folder to folder.
3. Add information with the Metadata panel.
You can view the information provided by your digital camera — in par-
ticular, technical data for each photo — and add information about each
image in the Metadata panel.
4. Apply labels and ratings.
You can color-code your photos for easier retrieval later — and rate
your photos (from one to five stars) and save the ratings so you can get
to the best ones quickly.
5. Sort and rename photos.
By adding keywords, labels, and ratings to your photos, you can easily
sort files later. Renaming files is a snap using Bridge: Double-click the file-
name and then type a new name.
6. Load images to Camera Raw or Photoshop.
After you’ve properly organized
your image files (and viewed
their thumbnails in the Content
area) is the time to load your
raw images into Camera Raw or
your other images directly into
Photoshop. 
Navigating and creating
image folders
Using the Bridge Folders panel is just
like navigating folders via Windows
Explorer, My Computer, or the Mac
Finder. The Folders panel gives you
an Explorer-like view of your com-
puter and your storage devices (such
as a CD-ROM drive or an external
hard drive). Figure 6-1 shows how
you can view folders using the
Folders panel.
Figure 6-1: Viewing folders in the Folders panel.

Another way to view folders and their contents through Bridge is to use the
Look In menu on the Option bar, as shown in Figure 6-2.
Figure 6-2: The Look In menu.
The Look In menu gives you a hierarchical view of the folders contained in
your Desktop, Favorites, and most Recent folders. Click a folder in the Look
In menu, and the contents of that folder are displayed in the viewing area.
Creating folders
If you haven’t yet created your Original, Working, and Output folders, here
are the steps that create these folders using Bridge:
1. Using the Folders panel, select the drive where you want to create the
new folder. 
2. Create a new images folder.
Choose File➪New Folder or press Ctrl+Shift+N (Ô+Shift+N on a Mac).
You can also click the Create New Folder icon on the Bridge Option bar.
Look In menu
105
Chapter 6: Managing Images

106
Part II: Image-Management Workflow with Adobe Bridge 
3. Name the folder.
Figure 6-3 shows you the newly created folder
in the Content area. Type a folder name over
the highlighted text New Folder. This is
where your creativity comes into play; you
can name the images folder anything you
want. Just don’t get too silly. (Personally, I call
my main images folder by the boring but prac-
tical name “Images.”)
4. Create working and output folders.
Click the new Images folder just created and
repeat Steps 2 and 3, creating subfolders
within this folder. You’ve just taken a huge
step toward getting control of that unruly
horde of images!
Digging for lost treasures
While you’re busy implementing a workflow to
manage your images, take time to organize
some of your older images as well. If you’re like
me, you have years of valuable photos that need
to be organized and archived. Not only is going
back and viewing older images fun, it can be
productive.
Currently, I’m in the process of scanning my
older 35mm slides. Some of those photos match
or exceed my quality expectations today, but
were never processed and printed for a variety
of reasons (but none of them very good
excuses!). The same story goes for some of my
early digital photos. It’s a long process, but with
a solid image-management strategy, you can
probably identify many of your older images to
add to your portfolio. 
Go ahead and start digging for lost treasures;
Bridge makes it fun and easy!
Figure 6-3: Naming a new
folder.

Organizing images in folders
After setting up folders for storing your digital images, you can get down to
business organizing your images into those folders. You may have many fold-
ers already, in various areas of your hard drive, but take this opportunity to
move those folders into the new structure you’ve set up for image manage-
ment. Organized folders are great for peace of mind. As I’ve demonstrated, I
set up three basic areas to store my images. Here’s how:
1. Copy your original images to your Original Image folders. 
I always leave my original images as originals. I don’t like to make
changes to these files; I want to keep them intact, as you would a film
negative. I simply download images from memory cards, each one into
its own subfolder in my Original Images folder, and then back up the new
image folder to DVD.
Give each folder a name that
combines chronological
sequence with a few descriptive
words so you have a clue to its
contents (as with the folders
shown in Figure 6-4). Such
folder names make it easier to
recognize folder contents later
when you view them in Bridge.
When your number of original
image folders grows to the hun-
dreds, the chronology and
descriptions included in folder
names will come in handy.
2. If you have some unfinished
“images in progress,” save
them to your “working” image
folders.
Create your working image fold-
ers to match the targeted pur-
pose of your images. If (for
example) you do mostly personal work such as pictures of family,
nature, or pets, then create a working folder for each category. If you’re
taking photos professionally, create a separate folder for each client or
job you’re working on. 
When first you open images in Camera Raw and Photoshop, get into the
habit of immediately saving the image file to a working image folder, in
Photoshop’s PSD format. That way the saved image becomes the one
you’re working on, and resides in the working folder. The original stays
intact, and you eliminate the risk of altering the original accidentally.
107
Chapter 6: Managing Images

descriptive folder names to your original image
folders.

108
Part II: Image-Management Workflow with Adobe Bridge 
3. If you have images you want to print or publish, save them to “output”
image folders.
When you’ve finished adjusting and editing your images, you’ll want to
save specialized versions of them to specific output folders — say, for
print, Web, or publication — with each version sized differently and
quite possibly assigned a different color space. (I cover creating output
images in more detail in Chapter 12.)
Adding Information to Images’ Metadata
Metadata is information that describes an image file — and it can encompass
not only the information provided by your digital camera, but also such tid-
bits as author information, your copyright, and keywords. Normally metadata
isn’t stored inside your image file, but instead in a standard Extensible
Metadata Platform (XMP) format, in a separate sidecar file — unless you’re
using DNG files (which store metadata along with the image).
You can use metadata information you add to an image later to organize and
keep track of files and versions, as well as search and sort images. The more
images you have, the more valuable this information becomes as a tool to
help manage your image library. This is one of the features that makes Bridge
so powerful.
You add metadata information to
images by typing the information in
the Metadata panel in Bridge, as
shown in Figure 6-5.
File Info offers you an easier and
more efficient method for adding
metadata information. You can
access File Info by choosing File➪File
Info or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I
(Ô+Shift+Option+I on the Mac). The
File Info window (the Pictures–Adobe
Bridge window on the Mac) appears,
as shown in Figure 6-6.
The Description window is the first
to show up on-screen. On its left
side, you’ll see a number of pages in
which you can view or add metadata.
Figure 6-5: The Metadata panel in Bridge.

Figure 6-6: Entering data into the File Info window.
As you click through each page of the File Info window, adding or viewing
data, you can always click OK to save your added information (or click
Cancel to quit).
The different File Info metadata pages include these:
 Description: You can add general information about your image here.
 Camera Data 1: Displays information provided by your digital camera.
 Camera Data 2: Displays more information provided by your digital
camera (some models are just pickier about details).
 Categories: You can enter information based on Associated Press 
categories.
 History: Displays Photoshop history information if the image was previ-
ously edited in Photoshop.
 IPTC Information Pages: You can enter information about the photo-
grapher and images per IPTC standards.
 Adobe Stock Photos: Provides information for images obtained through
Adobe Stock Photos.

 Origin: Here you can enter additional information for images targeted to
the news media.
 Advanced: Here you can view EXIF data about the image you’re working
with. The camera information includes zoom setting, shutter speed,
aperture, white balance, and even the type of lens you used. 
For the most part, the File Info and Metadata fields were built around IPTC
standards, which cater to the international press community. (Hey, why not —
they’re one of the largest groups of professional photographers around the
world!) Take advantage of the standards that IPTC has put forth and increase
the manageability of your growing image library. You can visit the IPTC
(International Press Telecommunications Council) site at www.iptc.org.
Applying Labels and Ratings
Organizing and searching a large number of digital photos in a detailed
manner can be a daunting task. Thankfully, Bridge provides some simple
methods of applying tags to images — which easily categorizes them for later
viewing.
Make a habit of applying ratings or labels to your photos when you first trans-
fer the images to your computer. View these new images with Bridge and apply
your labels and ratings at the same time you apply any metadata information.
You’ll be thankful, in later months and years, that you took a little time to add
this information. (Think of the savings on aspirin alone.)
Applying color labels
In previous versions of Photoshop, you could flag an image (toggle a special
indicator on or off) to determine which images were keepers. Bridge now
offers more advanced ways to organize and search images by applying color
labels — which helps you develop a system of organizing images to reflect
your priorities and choices with more options.
Figure 6-7 shows where to apply color labels to images in Bridge. For the
example shown, I applied color labels to the images in the Bridge Content
area (not hard — you just choose the Label menu and then select the color
label for the image). Here I use green to mean “go” (that is, use the image and
print it), red is a “no-go” (don’t use the image), and yellow as a “maybe” (con-
sider using this image later).
Applying color labels makes photos much easier to view and organize later.
When you want to view only the images in a folder labeled with a particular
color, you just click the Unfiltered button on the Bridge Option bar and then
choose that color, as shown in Figure 6-8.

Figure 6-8: Applying a filter to view images only with a certain color label.
111
Chapter 6: Managing Images

112
Part II: Image-Management Workflow with Adobe Bridge 
If you want, you can change the labels to descriptive names, such as “flowers,
landscapes, keepers, possible, or print.” Just choose Edit➪Preferences in
Bridge, and choose the Labels category to change the default names. 
Applying ratings to images
Another way to organize and view
images is to apply a rating to your
images. You can apply ratings to
your images from one star to five
stars, as shown in Figure 6-9. I apply
high ratings — four or five stars — to
images I intend to process, print, or
post to the Web. Images that I rate at
three stars or fewer may never get
processed. (Feel free to come up
with your own system of rating
images.)
Two quick steps apply ratings to
your images:
1. Select images that you want to rate with the same rating.
Click the images while holding down the Ctrl key on a PC or the Ô key
on a Mac.
2. Choose Label➪Rating. 
You can apply ratings from one star to five stars. You can also choose
color labels.
Sorting and searching photos
Applying labels and ratings to your photos is a great method to sort and
search for photos later. To sort photos in Bridge, choose View➪Sort. Select
the sort method you want from the Sort menu. (I chose to sort by rating in
Figure 6-10.)
You have various ways to sort images in a folder, using the sort methods
available in the Sort menu — including by rating and by label.
Toggle your sorts by selecting and deselecting Ascending Order in the Sort
menu. In Bridge, the default setting is Ascending; your highest-rated images
appear at the bottom.
Figure 6-9: Applying ratings to selected images.

Figure 6-10: Sorting photos by rating.
Loading Photos to Camera Raw and Photoshop
Some digital photographers like to load their photos into Photoshop the old-
fashioned way: by using the File➪Open command in Photoshop. Many others,
however, prefer the visual displays and search methods offered in Bridge.
Bridge is so versatile, it can accommodate many personal preferences.
To load photos into Photoshop using Bridge, follow these steps:
1. Use the Bridge Folders panel (or the Look In menu) to find the folder
where the desired image files are stored. 
2. View the images stored in the Content area of Bridge.
You can use the scrollbar to view the images that do not appear in the
Content area.
113
Chapter 6: Managing Images

114
Part II: Image-Management Workflow with Adobe Bridge 
3. Double-click the image you
want to load in Photoshop or
click the file, and then press
Ctrl+O (Ô+O on a Mac).
The image loads into a
Photoshop image window. If
you haven’t already started
Photoshop, it starts automati-
cally and displays the selected
image, ready to edit.
There is no steadfast rule for how
to browse and open images in
Photoshop. It’s totally up to personal
preference. Play around with Bridge
to find out the best way for you to
browse and open images. Figure 6-11
shows another way of opening
images in Bridge, which is to right-
click the image thumbnail in Bridge
and choose Open in Camera Raw.

Working with 
Raw Images

In this part . . .
W
hen I ﬁrst switched from ﬁlm to shoot-
ing digital, I was amazed at the quality of
the photos I was getting from those older 3- and 
5-megapixel sensors. The JPEGs I produced are
still staples in my portfolio today. When I gradu-
ated to more advanced digital cameras and started
shooting photos in raw format, however, I felt that
my photographic capabilities had suddenly shot
through the roof!
I played and experimented with other raw convert-
ers when I started, but always used Camera Raw
for my more serious work. Why bother mastering
another software program when I could just use
Camera Raw? After all, I was perfectly happy with
the results I was getting from converting my raw
images with Camera Raw.
I’ve reached the point where I can open a raw ﬁle
in Camera Raw, make color and tonal adjustments,
and then open the image in Photoshop to make
any necessary edits and apply ﬁnishing touches.
Often the color and tonal values I worked up in
Camera Raw are right on — and those adjustments
are a lot quicker to make than the same adjust-
ments in Photoshop. After you get some practice
with the steps in this part’s chapters, I suspect
you’ll come to the same conclusion!

 Understanding white balance and saturation
 Making tonal adjustments
 Evaluating images
A
s you can probably tell by now, I’m a huge fan of Camera Raw and
Photoshop. It rates right up there with football, big lenses, ice cream,
and good science fiction on TV. (Live long and prosper!) Though you can do
some amazing things with Camera Raw and Photoshop, the key to really get-
ting the most out of your images is — first — to understand exposure, color,
and tonality. After you get those down, the rest becomes easier, and a
lot more fun!
The purpose of this chapter isn’t to dazzle you with 
technical terms and the scientific background of image
sensors, light, and color. Instead, I explain the different
color adjustments and then get into what the tools
are for adjusting tonality. Understanding both color
and tonality sorts out what tasks need to be done
when processing images in Camera Raw, and fine-
tuning your images in Photoshop.
Getting to Know Color and Tonality
Camera Raw gives you control of a lot of important adjust-
ments in your photos, but before you dive into your raw images, I
explain what you need to look for and evaluate in your images before you
start making adjustments to white balance, tint, exposure, shadows, bright-
ness, contrast, and saturation. Collectively, those adjustments are referred to
as overall adjustments. (Gotta love those fancy technical terms.)

118
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
It’s important to understand each of
these areas so you’ll know what to
do to an image to “make it look right”
when you print it or prepare it for
viewing. If you’re into photos of
people, you need to pay special
attention to the skin tones of the
people you’re photographing.
Whether your subjects are Asian,
Caucasian, or even Martian, the last
thing you want is to process a photo
that makes your subjects’ skin look
too yellow or red (or too green or
blue, depending on where their
ancestors lived on this planet, or
another). You want to make sure
the “skin tone,” the right amount of
color in the skin, looks the way it’s
supposed to, as in the portrait in
Figure 7-1. 
Color is everything
Often you’ll see the terms color and tone used in the same sentence to describe
color — which isn’t exactly accurate. Color adjustments refer to making changes
to a particular color in the entire image. Changing white balance, adjusting tint,
and increasing color saturation are examples of changing color in an image.
(When you adjust tone, you’re changing the way those colors are distributed
across different parts of the image. See the next section, “Understanding tone,”
for more details.)
When you first open a raw image in Camera Raw, chances are you’ll need to
adjust color in the image. Your digital camera collects color information for
each pixel, but doesn’t process the image to adjust the color to any known
standard. It’s up to you to adjust the amount of color in your image. The con-
trols you use in Camera Raw to change and adjust color include
 White Balance: White balance is first adjusted in your digital camera so
you can properly set up your camera for the type of lighting conditions
you’re shooting in.
The white balance setting in your digital camera (or the equivalent adjust-
ment in Camera Raw) is actually a combination of color temperature and
tint. In Camera Raw, you can actually set those two adjustments separately.
Digital cameras today usually do a great job when you set them to do the
white balance setting automatically; the camera adjusts both the color
temperature and tint for the image. For instance, a room illuminated with
Figure 7-1: It’s important to properly evaluate
skin tones for portraits.

fluorescent lighting gives a particular look to the color of the images shot
there — and it’s different from what you’d get in the same room illuminated
with ambient lighting. Same goes for the great outdoors: Your digital
camera automatically adjusts color temperature and tint differently for
direct sunlight, shade, or cloudy conditions.
 Temperature: Temperature is the precise measurement of light using the
Kelvin scale (that’s Kelvin, not Kevin!). For instance, daylight is measured
at 5500° and fluorescent light is measured at 3800°. An outdoor photo
taken with a “fluorescent” color temperature of 3800° will have a blue cast
to it, as shown in Figure 7-2. If your image appears blue in Camera Raw,
you can adjust the color temperature to compensate for the blue cast.
Figure 7-2: An outdoor photo with different color temperature settings.
 Tint: Tint is another control you can use to tweak the look of a color in
an image. The Camera Raw tint adjustment allows you to fine-tune white
balance by increasing or decreasing the amount of green or magenta.
 Saturation: Saturation is simply the degree of intensity applied to a color in
an image. Increasing or decreasing overall color (equal red, blue, and green
channels) in an image is accomplished by using the Saturation slider in
Camera Raw. In Photoshop, you can increase the Red, Green, or Blue (RGB)
colors in the image individually, or by using the combined RGB adjustment.
In addition to the Saturation control in Camera Raw, the Calibration tab
(shown in detail in Chapters 8 and 9) lets you fine-tune Red, Green, and
Blue hues and saturation — as well as adjust for any color cast in the
shadows.

Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Understanding tone
After you’ve adjusted the white balance, tint, and saturation of your image’s
colors in Camera Raw, you can make tonal adjustments to distribute those
colors across different parts of the image. You’re not changing any color:
you’re changing the way it appears in the light tone, dark tone, and midtone
(in-between) areas of the image, as shown in Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-3: Light, dark, and midtone areas of an image.
Light
Dark
Midtones

Think of tone as not changing color within an image, but how you dis-
tribute color across it. When you adjust exposure, shadows, brightness, 
contrast, and curves in Camera Raw, you are making tonal changes to the
image. 
Tonal adjustments to your images are made by using these controls in
Camera Raw and Photoshop:
 Exposure: Worth the price of Photoshop CS2 all by itself, the Camera
Raw Exposure control allows you to increase or decrease the actual
exposure of an image. Getting a good exposure with your digital camera
is important, but it’s nice to be able to increase or decrease the amount
of exposure digitally. That capability helps prevent processing an image
that’s overexposed (too dark) or underexposed (too light). Check out
the examples in Figure 7-4 to see what I mean.
Figure 7-4: Underexposed, overexposed, and just right!
A new feature in CS2 is the Exposure adjustment. It’s a nice addition to
Photoshop, similar to a feature used in Camera Raw for non-raw images
such as JPEGs or TIFFs. The drawback to using the Photoshop Exposure
adjustment is that it’s considered destructive; you’re potentially throw-
ing away pixels. 
If you’re shooting raw, always adjust exposure using Camera Raw;
reserve the Photoshop Exposure adjustment for other file formats.

Chapter 7: Understanding Exposure and Color

Part III: Working with Raw Images 
 Shadows: Camera Raw gives us the ability to increase or decrease areas
of the image that are mapped (assigned as black). Increasing Shadows in
Camera Raw has a benefit of making the image appear as if it has more
contrast. I recommend that you increase Shadows only until clipping
(loss of detail) occurs. I explain more about the Shadows adjustment
and clipping in Chapter 9.
 Brightness: In Photoshop, brightness is combined with the Brightness/
Contrast adjustment. In Camera Raw, the Brightness adjustment is a
standalone control. 
 Contrast: The Contrast control allows you to increase or decrease con-
trast in the midtones of the image; you can make your light areas lighter
and your dark areas darker. Another advantage to shooting raw is that
you can adjust contrast in Camera Raw without throwing away any
image data. Like the other color and tonal controls in Camera Raw, the
Contrast control changes your images non-destructively. 
As with the Shadows adjustment, be sure you monitor any clipping that
may occur when you increase or decrease the contrast in an image.
Evaluating Color and Tonality
When you’ve got a good handle on what color and tonality means as applied
to Camera Raw and Photoshop, the next skill to master is evaluating images.
Thankfully, Camera Raw and Photoshop offer the photographer such tools as
histograms (which I get to in Chapter 8), and clipping warnings to help you
evaluate color and tonality. But don’t forget the best judge of all — yourself!
Yes, it’s true that Camera Raw and Photoshop enable you to make precise
overall adjustments, but sometimes the dominant factor in adjusting color
and tone must be the artistic taste of the photographer. Camera Raw and
Photoshop are artistic tools, after all; the completed image should reflect
your personal interpretation. Sometimes that means adding a touch more
color, saturation, or contrast to an image to get a specific effect.
Personally, I tend to enhance shadows and color saturation a tad more than
the norm in some of my nature and abstract images (such as the one shown in
Figure 7-5). Hey, I like color! For my portraits, skin tones are far less forgiving;
I tend to make my overall adjustments exactly as the portrait dictates — to
match the photo I viewed through the lens of my digital camera. Skin tones
need to be exact, or the portrait just won’t look right.

Figure 7-5: Color and tonality can be a matter of the photographer’s personal vision of the image.
Doing the evaluation
Before beginning any adjustments in Camera Raw or Photoshop, take these
steps to evaluate your image:
1. Open the image in Camera Raw.
To do that, find the thumbnail in Bridge of the image you want to evalu-
ate, and click it. Then you can choose File➪Open In Camera Raw or
press Ctrl+R (Ô+R on a Mac).
2. View the image in the Camera Raw window and evaluate white balance.
You’ll get more proficient at judging white balance of an image with 
practice. Taking this step for every image you process will get you
there quicker. Look for a portion of the image that is supposed to be
white. Does that area have a blue or orange/yellow tint to it? If so,
your white balance needs to be adjusted.
123
Chapter 7: Understanding Exposure and Color

124
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Color temperature will become more blue when decreased and more
orange/yellow in cast when increased. If your image has a blue color
cast, increase the color temperature in Camera Raw. If the image
appears too yellow in cast, decrease the color temperature.
3. Evaluate the image for correct exposure. 
Judging whether an image looks too dark or too light seems an easy way
to judge exposure. For some photographs, I’m sure that’s fine — but
Camera Raw offers features that really let you fine-tune exposure. I show
you those foolproof techniques in Chapter 9.
4. Evaluate shadows.
As explained earlier in this chapter, evaluating shadows is judging
whether the midtones of the image should be lighter or darker. Camera
Raw lets you adjust this to your personal taste, but it also shows you
when your adjustment is causing clipping (loss of detail) in the shadow
areas of your image.
5. Evaluate Brightness.
Though I often adjust exposure just up to where clipping is introduced, I
may want to make an image lighter or darker, depending on what I want
to convey. I use the Camera Raw Brightness control to increase or decrease
brightness to my taste.
6. Evaluate Contrast.
For my scenic photos, whether they be cityscapes or landscapes, I tend
to lean more toward higher contrast. For portraits, I’ll only increase con-
trast if there is not enough contrast in the image, making the skin tones
unrealistic.
7. Determine how much color you want to add or subtract to the image. 
The last evaluation I make to an image is saturation. With raw images,
often the way to reveal the color in the image as you had envisioned
while taking the photo is to move the Saturation slider higher.
The breakfast-by-the-lake example
I have a great shooting arrangement with Bambi, one of my favorite models.
I show up every Saturday morning at 7:30 a.m. at the park with my digital
camera, tripod, and backpack, and hike over to the part of the lake where she
has breakfast. On cue, she then hides behind some trees and I take photos of
her. Strictly professional! 

Figure 7-6 shows an original image of Bambi, and the same image adjusted for
color and tonality in Camera Raw. I first evaluated the white balance of the
image, and decided to increase the temperature slightly to add a little “warmth”
(a little more orange and yellow). I then actually decreased exposure, not to
correct the image, but to make it slightly darker. I decided to increase shad-
ows a bit (remember, I like my dark areas to be a little darker than normal
sometimes), and then increased the saturation to bring out some color.
Figure 7-6: Original image, and the same image after evaluating 
and making adjustments.
Except for an out-of-focus branch or two, I liked the way Bambi turned out!
(Of course, I can always get rid of some of the branches covering her face
with the nifty Healing Brush tool, which I further explain in Chapter 11.) I’m
going to bring her a print next Saturday. (I hope she doesn’t think I’m bring-
ing her breakfast.)

Part III: Working with Raw Images 
It’s easy to go bonkers with color and tonal adjustments in both Camera Raw
and Photoshop. In Figure 7-5, for example, the background color is slightly
exaggerated, but that’s an effect I wanted for that particular photo. For other
photos, I may not exaggerate saturation or contrast at all, it depends on how
I want my image to be viewed. Be careful you don’t make adjustments so
extreme that your photos start to appear unrealistic — unless, of course,
some of you Surrealists want them to be like that!

f you shoot raw images (or are planning on doing so in the
near future), you’re going to find Camera Raw as your
best friend. As a photographer, I’ve used Camera Raw
exclusively to make my color and tonal adjustments
since I switched to the raw format some time ago.
The more proficient you become at making adjust-
ments in Camera Raw, the less you’ll depend on
Photoshop to make those corrections. You’ll reach
that level of “enlightenment” the moment you dis-
cover that after getting a raw image into Photoshop,
you don’t need to adjust any levels, curves, brightness,
contrast, or saturation. All of your Camera Raw adjust-
ments were right on . . . You have arrived! 
Looking at Camera Raw
When you first load Camera Raw by opening a raw image, the first thing you’ll
notice is a large image preview (unobstructed by toolbars and palettes).
Controls for adjusting images surround the image preview on the top,
bottom, and right, as shown in Figure 8-1. 

128
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Figure 8-1: The Camera Raw tools and controls.
On top of the image preview is the Camera Raw Tool palette and Option bar.
The Tool palette contains controls for zooming, moving, white balance, color
sampling, cropping, straightening, and rotating. To the bottom of the image,
you’ll find workflow settings that let you set the color space to work in, image
size, and bit depth. At the right of the image are the histogram, settings,
Camera Raw menus, and Camera Raw control tabs.
Working with the Toolbar Controls
The Camera Raw toolbar, shown in Figure 8-2, consists of the basic tools
needed to edit an image. Here’s a rundown:

Image Preview
Preview check boxes

Figure 8-2: Tool palette and Option bar in Camera Raw.
 Zoom tool (press Z): Use this tool to enlarge your view of the image
shown in the Image Preview. 
 Hand tool (press H): If you zoom in to the image, you can move the
image around by dragging it with the Hand tool. (Wouldn’t it be nice to
have one of these in real life when somebody nabs your parking spot?)
 White Balance tool (press I): Use this tool to select a neutral gray area
of the image to use in improving the white balance.
 Color Sampler tool (press S): Use this one to select pixels whose RGB
values you want displayed on-screen.
 Crop tool (press C): You can use this new tool to crop images in Camera
Raw instead of waiting until the image is loaded into Photoshop.
 Straighten tool (press A): Cool tool alert! This is a great addition to
Camera Raw — you can use it to straighten images without the hassle of
straightening in Photoshop. Now making that horizon straight is easier
than ever.
 Rotate buttons (press L for left, R for right): Rotate your image clockwise
or counterclockwise with one click of the left or right Rotate buttons.
 Preview check box: Preview is a fun feature to use. If you want to com-
pare what your image looks like with and without adjustments made in
Camera Raw, you can toggle the image between those views by checking
and unchecking the Preview check box.
 Shadows check box: I recommend this a few times in the next chapter,
but I’ll say it now: Make sure this check box is checked before you adjust
images in Raw. When it’s checked, Camera Raw shows you the clipped
shadow areas of the image (pixels that contain no detail, due to under-
or overexposure in that part of the image). 
 Highlights check box: As with the Shadows check box, make sure this
one is checked before you tweak an image in Raw; that way you can view
clippings in the highlight areas of the image.

Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Reading the Histogram and RGB Values
The histogram and the RGB readout
give you information about the color
and exposure values of the image as
it appears in the Camera Raw Image
Preview. The RGB readout displays
the Red, Green, and Blue color values
when you point to a selection in the
Image Preview with any of four tools
(Zoom, Hand, White Balance, or
Color Sampler). The histogram, as
shown in Figure 8-3, shows the cur-
rent exposure setting of the image.
Reading the RGB values and viewing
the histogram is cool, but what does
it all mean to the photographer
who’s processing images in Camera Raw? In essence, they are both visual
tools you can use to evaluate the adjustments you’re making to the image. 
The histogram shows you the current individual Red-, Green-, and Blue-channel
histograms; you use it to evaluate exposure. White and colored spikes at either
the left or right of the histogram indicate clipping. With that information, you
can better judge where to adjust the tonal values of the image.
Image Settings
The Image Settings selection box
(see Figure 8-4) lets you view differ-
ent versions of the image as you
make adjustments. Choosing Image
Settings, for example, shows you the
image as it was before you made
adjustments. Choosing Camera Raw
Defaults restores the default image
settings in Camera Raw. And choos-
ing Previous Conversion applies the
Camera Raw settings from the last
image you worked on in Camera Raw.
The Custom selection shows how the
image looks after applying the
adjustments you’ve made.

Camera Raw Menu
For some reason, they almost hid the
Camera Raw menu! If you look hard
enough, next to the Image Settings
selection, there’s that little triangle
thingie button, that’s the Camera
Raw menu shown in Figure 8-5. The
menu includes commands to load,
save, or delete settings or subsets of
settings. 
It’s an impressive list of alternatives
for applying settings, including some
really helpful timesaving commands
to use on your raw images. I describe
each Camera Raw menu setting in
this list:
 Load Settings: This command
makes a lot more sense when
you’ve reviewed the other menu options in this list. When you choose
Load Settings, you can choose from saved Camera Raw settings you
made in previous images. 
If you have a slew of images to convert and not much time, saving the
settings from one image and loading them into another can not only
save you time but also give the converted raw images some overall
visual consistency.
 Save Settings: This command saves the settings you’ve made to an
image in Camera Raw with the intention of reusing those settings in
other (similar) images. When you’ve finished making the Camera Raw
adjustments, choose the Save Settings command and name the settings,
or leave their default name (that of the image filename) in place.
 Save Settings Subset: If you don’t want to save all of an image’s settings,
you can save subsets of the adjustments you make in Camera Raw. You
choose those adjustments in the Subset window (see Figure 8-6) when
you choose Save Settings Subset.
131

Part III: Working with Raw Images 
 Export Settings: This is an espe-
cially useful command when
you’re copying images to a CD
or sending a batch of images via
e-mail to an agency (or to others
to work on your images), and
you want to retain the adjust-
ments you’ve made in Camera
Raw. The Export Settings com-
mand lets you create a sidecar
XMP file  that can be copied with
the image so it can be loaded
with the image later. Export
Settings will create sidecar files
only if none exists, as in the
case of the raw file being in 
DNG format.
 Use Auto Adjustments: With the improvements in CS2 including a new
Camera Raw, one of the nice additions is Auto Adjustments. By default,
Camera Raw applies auto adjustments to an image when it’s first loaded.
Auto adjustments works pretty well; sometimes I don’t even have to do
any tweaking at all!
I suggest leaving Use Auto Adjustments turned on, but if you want, you
can turn Auto Adjustments off by pressing Ctrl+U (Ô+U on a Mac), or
toggling it on or off in the Camera Raw menu.
 Save New Camera Raw Defaults: Camera Raw bases its default settings
on the model of digital camera that’s producing your raw images. For each
different digital camera that Camera Raw supports, it uses a specific set
of adjustments tailored for each. When you open a raw file produced by
a Canon EOS 350D, for example (or a Nikon N70s, or any other digital
camera supported), Camera Raw applies the corresponding adjustments.
If you want to use your own set of defaults, just make whatever adjust-
ments you want in your new default set, and then choose Save New
Camera Raw Defaults from the Camera Raw menu.
 Reset Camera Raw Defaults: Although you can save new Camera Raw
default settings for your specific model of digital camera, you can always
switch back to the original defaults by choosing Reset Camera Raw
Defaults from the Camera Raw menu.
 Preferences: Thankfully, there aren’t a lot of settings to change in the
Camera Raw Preferences window (shown in Figure 8-7), but some of the
changes you can make in Preferences are very important. 
Figure 8-6: Using Save Settings Subset to save
selected adjustments.

Preferences lets you specify
where to save Camera Raw
adjustments (to a sidecar file or
a database) and apply sharpen-
ing adjustments made in Camera
Raw (to the raw image or for
preview only), as well as tweak
the Camera Raw cache and
choose how sidecar files are
stored. Here’s the list:
• Save Image Settings In:
In this selection, you can
indicate whether you want to save Camera Raw settings for images
in the Camera Raw database or sidecar (XMP) files. The default set-
ting is XMP, which allows you to copy raw settings along with files. 
Camera Raw doesn’t make any physical changes to your raw images,
it saves any adjustments you make to sidecar files (which can later
be copied with the raw images). If you change Save Image Settings
In so your changes are saved to the Camera Raw database, you can
still view your changes but you can’t copy those changes to other
computers, CDs, or DVDs later on.
• Apply Sharpening To: This is actually the only change to preferences
I make. I make sure that I set this preference to apply sharpening
to preview images only. If you set sharpening to preview images
only, you can preview in Camera Raw what the image will look like
sharpened, but not apply sharpening before opening the image in
Photoshop. 
Sharpening images is a workflow step best saved for last. To maxi-
mize the quality of a final image, do your sharpening after you’ve
done your editing and re-sizing in Photoshop. (I cover sharpening
in Chapter 12.)
• Camera Raw Cache: Cache is a term used to describe storage
space (in this case, storage on your hard drive) where image data
for recently viewed and adjusted images is stored for fast retrieval.
The default cache is 1GB — and one gigabyte is sufficient for most
image processing needs — but if you work with hundreds of raw
files at one time, you may want to increase the Camera Raw Cache
setting.
• DNG File Handling: Settings for ignoring XMP sidecar files and
updating image previews can be turned on in this section by click-
ing on the respective selection boxes. If you’re working with DNG
files, there really isn’t any advantage to ignoring previous XMP
sidecar files, so I’d leave that defaulted to not selected. I also leave
the Update Embedded JPEG Previews option unchecked, as I usu-
ally don’t have a need to update raw file JPEG preview images
(after all, they are just previews!).

Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Camera Raw Workflow Settings
At the lower-left corner of the Camera
Raw window is a set of Workflow
options (see Figure 8-8). Unlike other
settings that are image-specific, you
can change or retain the Workflow
settings for all the images you’ve worked on in Camera Raw. These settings
include the color space you want your images to be converted to when they’re
opened in Photoshop, as well as the bit depth of the files, the image size, and
the resolution in which to open the image. Here’s the lineup:
 Space: Choose one of four color spaces to use when converting the
image: Adobe RGB (1998), Colormatch RGB, ProPhoto RGB, or SRGB.
I always leave this setting at Adobe RGB (1998), as most of my work is
prepared for printing or press. If your photographs are being prepared
exclusively for the Web, you may want to choose the sRGB option.
 Depth: Raw images are typically set to 16-bits per channel, which gives
you 128 times the tonal range of 8-bit images. That’s a lot more informa-
tion (hence more detail) to work with in Photoshop. Because most of
your images will be further adjusted in Photoshop, I recommend leaving
this set to 16-bits per channel.
 Size: Camera Raw will set the size to the default resolution of your digital
camera. If you know you’re going to be producing large prints or smaller
images for your image, you can set the resolution higher or lower, and
let Camera Raw do the resampling (which is quicker than resizing the
image later in Photoshop). This feature can come in handy when you
have to process multiple images in Camera Raw. For individual images,
some photographers save resizing for later, as a step in their output-
preparation workflow.
 Resolution: If you have determined the final resolution you want for your
image, you can make that change in the Resolution setting. (I usually pre-
pare my images for printing, so I set the resolution to 360 pixels per inch.)
Camera Raw Controls
The Camera Raw control panels, also known as tabs (see Figure 8-9), are
where most of your work will happen when you process images. Color, tone,
detail, lens, curve, and calibration adjustments are available in each tab. 
Figure 8-8: Camera Raw Workflow options.

Figure 8-9: Camera Raw controls.
I show you the details of how to use them in Chapter 9; for now, here’s a
summary of what they do:
 Adjust tab (Ctrl+Alt+1, Ô+Option+1 on a Mac): This tab contains all
the controls that adjust color and tonal values in an image: White
Balance, Temperature, Tint, Exposure, Shadows, Brightness, Contrast,
and Saturation.
 Detail tab (Ctrl+Alt+2, Ô+Option+2 on a Mac): This tab is home to the
Sharpness, Luminance Smoothing, and Color Noise Reduction controls.
Though I recommend that you use Camera Raw sharpening only for
viewing images (save the real sharpening for later, in Photoshop), you
can use this tab to reduce grayscale noise (with Luminance Smoothing)
and turn down the color noise (with the Color Noise control) — a very
welcome feature!
 Lens tab (Ctrl+Alt+3, Ô+Option+3 on a Mac): The Lens Tab includes
some advanced controls that let you make corrections to images that
contain chromatic aberrations (also called lens artifacts) and vignetting
(dark or light borders around an image).
Vignetting can actually become an artistic effect you can add to images,
especially portraits. Sometimes I use the Vignetting control to actually
introduce vignetting into an image.
135
Chapter 8: Getting Acquainted with Camera Raw

136
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
 Curve tab (Ctrl+Alt+4, Ô+Option+4 on a Mac): I find this control invalu-
able. The curve adjustment is a tool used to fine-tune the tonality of an
image. You still need to make tonal adjustments in the Adjust tab, but
the Curve tab is where you finish it off. Three preset curve adjustments
are available: Linear (default), Medium Contrast, and Strong Contrast.
You can also customize the curve by dragging different points on the
graph.
Use the Curve tab to make your final brightness and contrast adjustments
instead of using the Photoshop Brightness/Contrast control (which actu-
ally causes the image to lose detail in the form of valuable data). 
 Calibrate tab (Ctrl+Alt+5, Ô+Option+5 on a Mac): The controls in the
Calibrate tab let you adjust the Camera Raw camera model (as recog-
nized by the image you’ve loaded in Camera Raw) so you get the best
shadow tint plus red, green, and blue hues and saturation.
Control Buttons
All these wonderful controls, prefer-
ences, and settings really won’t help
you unless you have a way of saving,
opening, canceling (which you’ll find
you can do a lot of), and closing
adjusted images — without having
to open them in Photoshop. To the
rescue come the Camera Raw control buttons, located to the lower right of
the Camera Raw window, as shown in Figure 8-10. 
Each control button has a specific function:
 Save (Ctrl+Alt+S, Ô+Option+S on a Mac): This button saves the adjust-
ments to the image while leaving the Camera Raw window open.
 Open (Ctrl+O, Ô+O on a Mac): Use this one only when you want to open
the image in Photoshop, because that’s what it does — and then it closes
the Camera Raw window.
 Cancel (Esc): Click this button when you want to exit from adjusting the
opened image without saving any changes you’ve made.
 Done (Enter): This button saves the adjustments and returns you to
Bridge without opening the converted image in Photoshop.

n to the raw workflow! In Chapter 8, I show you all the neat tools and con-
trols Camera Raw has to offer. Here’s where those tools go to
work processing raw images. Developing and using a consistent
workflow to process your raw images (while taking advan-
tage of Bridge automation features) will help you become
more efficient.
Camera Raw gives the photographer some serious
tools for correcting color and tone. If you take the
time to get some practice at using them properly,
you’ll find these corrections are actually easier to
make in Camera Raw than in Photoshop. I’ve gotten
to the point that many of the images I process in
Camera Raw are pretty much ready for prime time
when I open them in Photoshop. As you’ll find, the
better you get at making these adjustments in Camera
Raw, the less you have to do later.

138
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Using a Step-by-Step Raw Process
I’ve gone over workflows in Chapter 4, but here is where we really dive into the
“raw” details of Camera Raw. As with all the processes I show you throughout
this book, processing images in raw requires its own step-by-step progression
of tasks:
1. Evaluate your image.
Take a look at your image as opened in Camera Raw. Be sure to take
advantage of the histogram, the shadows and highlights, and the 
clipping warnings. 
2. Correct the white balance.
White balance (the combination of temperature and tint) takes a little
getting used to adjusting. The best way to become proficient is to 
experiment using the different white balance choices Camera Raw 
provides.
3. Adjust exposure using the Exposure control.
It bears repeating: This control is extremely valuable. That’s because it’s
hard to get dead-on exposures with your digital camera in some lighting
conditions. The Exposure control lets you fine-tune the exposure of the
image as you’ve envisioned it. 
4. Adjust shadows using the
Shadows control.
Those dark areas of the image
can use some tender loving
adjustment once in a while —
and the Shadows control helps
you control clipping in those
dark areas of an image.
5. Adjust brightness using the
Brightness control.
There are going to be images
where you’ll adjust the expo-
sure exactly where you want it
to minimize clipping in the high-
lights like the example shown in
Figure 9-1. The Brightness con-
trol gives you the option of
lightening up the image a bit
without re-introducing those
pesky “clips.”
Figure 9-1: Clipped highlights show up in red.

About that technical term, “pesky clips” — it’s a word I use to describe
chunks of pixels that have no image definition, a condition known as
clipping. (“Pesky” is a technical term for “colorful rude word we can’t
print here.”)
6. Adjust contrast using the Contrast control.
If the Camera Raw default contrast setting isn’t “doing it” for you, use
the Contrast control to increase or decrease the contrast in the image.
In addition to the Contrast control, you can use the Curves control to
increase or decrease contrast in an image.
7. Adjust saturation using the Saturation control.
Increase the amount of color in your image using the Saturation control.
As with other adjustments that apply color or tone in Camera Raw,
increasing saturation helps bring out the color in your image.
8. Apply the Curves adjustment.
Fine-tune the dark, light, and midtone areas of your image using the
Curve control (located in the Curve tab).
9. Reduce noise, using the Luminance Smoothing and Color Noise
Reduction controls.
If your images were shot at a high ISO, a slower shutter speed, or both,
you could wind up with a color-speckled effect called noise. The Detail
tab contains two controls: Luminance Smoothing (which reduces gray-
scale “grain”) and the Color Noise Reduction control (which reduces
those speckled artifacts found in some images).
10. Correct lens aberrations and vignetting.
If you have noticeable lens shortcomings such as aberrations and
vignetting, you can easily correct these by using the Aberrations and
Vignetting controls in the Lens tab.
139
Chapter 9: Processing Raw Images
Incorporating DNG into your raw workflow
Adobe’s new DNG format (described in Chapter 2)
is an attempt to standardize a raw file format that
stands a pretty decent chance of being com-
patible with computer software 10 or 15 years
from now. Many photographers who shoot with
cameras from multiple makers (hey, it happens!)
want to use one standardized raw format for all
their cameras — but also want some assurance
that photo editors and raw converters will recog-
nize their raw-format originals in the foreseeable
future. DNG is the option that comes closest to
filling the bill. 
(continued)

140
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
If you want to convert raw images to DNG format,
the steps are simple:
1. Open the DNG Converter from the shortcut
on your desktop.
2. Select the folder that contains the original
raw images you want to convert.
3. Select a folder destination to which you
want to copy the converted DNG files. 
You can also create a new folder by click-
ing the Make New Folder button. 
4. Click the Convert button.
(continued)
In my workflow, I always copy my original raw
files first — to two quality DVD discs (one for on-
site storage, one for off-site storage). These days
I’ve also started converting my raw files to DNG,
using Adobe’s DNG converter. Those converted
DNG files get backed up to separate DVDs as
well (yes, two copies!). Incorporating DNG into
your raw workflow would involve only three extra
steps: converting your raw images to DNG, back-
ing up the converted images to CD or DVD, and
then opening these converted files in Camera
Raw at the beginning of your raw workflow.
The jury is still out on whether DNG will become
the favorite raw archiving format of the future,
but just now it’s the only option available that
allows photographers and studios the ability to
convert all disparate raw images to a common
format for image archives.

Evaluating Images
The first step in processing raw images is to evaluate your image. Chances are,
the first time you really view an image other than the thumbnails in Bridge is
through the Camera Raw preview. When you first open an image in Camera
Raw, Auto Adjustments are automatically applied. (That would explain why
your raw images actually look pretty good!) 
If you want to see what your image looks like without Auto Adjustments, press
Ctrl+U (Ô+U on a Mac) to toggle Auto Adjustments on and off.
The image shown in Figure 9-2 represents an unprocessed image loaded in
Camera Raw — with and without Auto Adjustments applied.
Figure 9-2: Raw image with (on left) and without Auto Adjustments.
For the most part, Auto Adjustments work pretty well to get me started for
many of my images, and I view images with Auto Adjustments applied when
evaluating for further adjustments. To evaluate images:
1. Open an image in Camera Raw.
141
Chapter 9: Processing Raw Images

142
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
2. Make sure Auto Adjustments
are turned on.
You can either press Ctrl+U
(Ô+U on a Mac) or click the
Camera Raw menu and choose
Use Auto Adjustments (see
Figure 9-3).
3. Check the Preview, Shadows,
and Highlights check boxes
(which are located along the top of the window, above your image).
To make sure your adjustments will be view-
able later, make sure the Preview button shown
in Figure 9-4 is checked. Also make sure the
Shadows and Highlights check boxes are
checked; you’ll want to know if any clipping
is present when you evaluate the image.
4. Evaluate white balance.
Look at the image and evaluate whether or not there is a blue or yellow
cast to it. If so, you’ll need to
adjust the white balance of the
image.
5. Evaluate exposure and shadows.
Check to see not only whether
the image appears underex-
posed or overexposed, but also
whether there’s clipping in the
shadow or highlight areas. This
is where adjustments can get
tricky. You’ll want to use a com-
bination of the Exposure and
Brightness controls to adjust
your image to gain the correct
exposure and minimize clipping
(as in the shadow area shown in
Figure 9-5). 
When evaluating an image,
enlarge the Image Preview so
you can check more closely for
clipping. Use the Zoom tool to
enlarge the image from 100 to
200 percent, and then check the
shadow and highlight areas. 
Figure 9-3: Using Auto Adjustments.
Figure 9-4: Checking the
Preview, Shadows, and
Highlights check boxes.
Figure 9-5: Clipping in the shadow areas of an
image.

6. Evaluate brightness and contrast.
Almost all raw images will have a need to have the contrast increased.
Auto Adjustments will make these adjustments to an optimum setting. 
7. Evaluate saturation.
Auto Adjustments don’t affect saturation; when it comes to judging how
much color you’d like to introduce into the image with the Saturation
control, you’re on your own. Often you can saturate to taste (so to speak),
but be careful; oversaturation “blows out” parts of your image with too
much color intensity. Pay special attention to the red and yellow areas;
these colors are often the first to become oversaturated.
8. Check for sharpness and noise.
When you’re working with raw images, it’s easy to overlook the controls
that aren’t in the other control tabs. Same goes for evaluating your image: 
a. Click the Details tab.
b. Slide the Sharpness control slider all the way to the left. 
c. Enlarge the image in the Image Preview by clicking the Zoom tool,
or by pressing Ctrl++ (that’s the plus-sign key on your keyboard).
You press Ô++ on a Mac.
d. View your image enlarged and check it for sharpness and image
noise.
I often view an image in Bridge, but until I open it in Camera Raw and
zoom in, I won’t know whether the image is sharp enough for me to even
want to proceed!
Adjusting the Image with the Adjust Tab
Finally we’re ready to edit some images in Camera Raw! I start by taking care
of the major business first — making color and tonal corrections (including
curves) to my image in the Adjust tab (Ctrl+Alt+1, or Ô+Option+1 on a Mac).
When you first open an image in Camera Raw, the default tab shown is the
Adjust tab shown in Figure 9-6. The Adjust tab is where you’ll make all of your
color and tonal adjustments that were described in Chapter 7, white 
balance (or color and tint), exposure, shadows, brightness, contrast, and 
saturation. I take you through each of these in order.
143
Chapter 9: Processing Raw Images

144
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Figure 9-6: The Adjust tab with Auto Adjustments applied.
Adjusting white balance
White balance, temperature, and tint all relate to each other. White balance is
actually a combination of color temperature and tint; in Camera Raw, you can
set it quickly by choosing any of the predefined temperature-and-tint settings.
Setting the white balance can be accomplished in two ways, choosing one of
the settings in the White Balance selection, or using the Temperature and Tint
controls. If you choose one of the preset White Balance selections, you’ll notice
that doing so adjusts the temperature and tint for you, as shown in Figure 9-7.
Each White Balance selection will dynamically change the Temperature and
Tint controls, displaying color temperature in degrees Kelvin.
On most digital cameras, you can set the white balance manually (and quickly)
by choosing preset White Balance selections — but if you happen to choose
one that doesn’t produce an image with correct temperature and tint, now’s
your chance to make it right! The Camera Raw White Balance, Temperature,
and Tint controls give the photographer the power to improve these values
in images that didn’t quite get photographed correctly.

Figure 9-7: The Adjust tab with Auto Adjustments applied.
Fluorescent, temperature 3800°, tint +21
Flash, temperature 5500°, tint 0
Shade, temperature 7500°, tint +10
Tungsten, temperature 2850°, tint 0
Daylight, temperature 5500°, tint +10
Cloudy, temperature 6500°, tint +10
As shot, temperature 4950°, tint -3
Auto, temperature 7500°, tint +1
145
Chapter 9: Processing Raw Images

146
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Here’s how to change the white balance of an image:
1. Click the White Balance selection (see Figure 9-8).
Choose one of the predefined White Balance selections that best repre-
sent lighting conditions for the image when you photographed it.
Figure 9-8: Selecting from pre-defined White Balance selections.
2. Fine-tune temperature.
If the White Balance setting still doesn’t give you the adjustment needed
to eliminate any blue or yellow cast, move the Temperature slider to the
right to remove any blue cast or to the left to remove any yellow cast to
the image.
3. Fine-tune tint.
You probably won’t need to adjust tint in many of your images, but if
you see a visible green or magenta cast to your image, move the Tint
slider to the right (to reduce green and increase magenta) or to the left
(to reduce magenta). 
Correcting indecent exposure
(Well, sometimes that happens when you shoot raw, right?) I think the Exposure
control in Camera Raw is worth the price of Photoshop itself! Okay, serious

photographers always strive to achieve the best exposures possible for their
images, but difficult lighting conditions can sometimes throw a digital camera’s
exposure off by a few f-stops.
Figure 9-9 shows an example of difficult lighting conditions: backlighting. I
was taking a photo of this troublemaker (he always gets into the bird feeders
in the garden), but the sun was coming in behind the subject, resulting in
underexposure. Backlit conditions are great for silhouettes, but not when you
want to capture detail of the main subject, as in my case here, Rocky the
squirrel. The Camera Raw Exposure control was the very thing I needed to
expose the main subject of the image correctly.
Figure 9-9: Rocky the “bird-feed-stealing-backlit-underexposed” squirrel.
To show you how to adjust exposure using the Camera Raw Exposure con-
trol, I’m switching topics from “pesky bird-feed-stealing squirrels of the
Midwest” to “photos taken in London.” The Camera Raw Exposure control
lets you increase or decrease exposure of an image that’s under- or overex-
posed. Unless you’re already an old hand, evaluating the exposure you get
from your digital camera can be tricky at first — but with some practice,
you’ll be comfortable in no time. Figure 9-10 shows the photo after the White
Balance Daylight setting was selected (in the previous step), but with the
Auto setting turned off in the Exposure setting so you can see the original
exposure.

Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Figure 9-10: Image with the original exposure shown.
It’s clear that the image is too dark — a common type of underexposure when
a photo is taken in bright light and the digital camera meters its exposure from
the bright sky. Fear not: The Camera Raw Exposure control can get that expo-
sure to where you want it. Here’s how:
1. Click the Auto button.
Make sure Auto Exposure is turned on, and re-evaluate your image expo-
sure with the Auto Exposure adjustment applied by Camera Raw. The
Auto adjustment for Exposure will approach where you want the image
to be corrected. For the image shown in Figure 9-11, the Auto adjustment
adds +1.35 (about one-and-a-third f-stops) to the exposure of the image. 
2. Increase or decrease exposure to avoid clipping.
Moving the Exposure control slider to the right increases exposure;
moving the slider to the left decreases exposure.

Figure 9-11: Camera Raw Auto set for the Exposure control.
Make sure the Shadows and
Highlights check boxes are checked
so you can view any clipping that
might occur as you adjust your
images in Camera Raw. Clipping in
the highlighted areas of the image
will show as red; clipping in the
shadow areas will show as blue.
(Figure 9-12 shows an example of
clipping in highlight areas of the sky,
a result of overexposure.) When
you start to see clipped areas in an
image, you’ll need to move the slid-
ers back until no clipping occurs.
You can also hold down the Alt key (Option on a Mac) while moving the slider
to check for clipping. Holding down the Alt/Option key turns the image black
and displays clipped pixels as they appear when you move the Exposure con-
trol slider. See Figure 9-13.
Avoidance of clipping isn’t the only goal of adjusting exposure. First you want
to adjust till you get the best exposure for the image. You can minimize clipping
with other controls (such as Shadows, Brightness, and the Contrast), but don’t
sacrifice the overall exposure of an image just to kill off a few clipped pixels.

Figure 9-13: Checking exposure while pressing the Alt (Option) key.
Using the histogram
Histograms can be very useful when evaluating images, but are an often-
overlooked or confusing tool used in Photoshop, Camera Raw, or even on
your digital camera. The reason histograms are confusing and overlooked?
Because nobody ever explains how to use them! When I first started using
digital cameras, my owner manuals always showed how to view the his-
togram, but not how to read it. As an avid reader, I also haven’t seen a lot
written about reading histograms or using them to correct images either. 
For the most part, a histogram is a chart that shows you the distribution of
pixels from the dark areas (indicated on the left side) to the light (on the right
side). While you’re shooting photos out in the field, your digital camera
shows you a histogram on its LCD to indicate the exposure of an image. When
you’re evaluating and adjusting images in Camera Raw, the histogram shows
you how red, green, and blue pixels are distributed in the current image,
using colored channels to represent red, green, and blue portions of the
chart. You’ll also see colors such as cyan, yellow, and magenta, too — but
those are specific combinations of red, green, and blue.

Figure 9-14 shows three histograms: one without clipping, one with clipping
in the image’s shadow areas (black end of the histogram), and one with clip-
ping in the highlight areas (white end of the histogram).
Figure 9-14: Reading the Camera Raw histogram.
One really useful feature of the Camera Raw histogram is its indication of clip-
ping. Spikes at the left end of the chart mean there is some clipping in the dark
areas of the image; spikes at the right end indicate clipping in the light areas.
You’ll see the histogram change as you adjust color and tone.
Lurking in the shadows
With white balance and exposure adjusted, the next step is adjusting the image
for the shadow tonal values. The Shadows control is located just under the
Exposure control, which is a pretty clear hint about what to do next: Move
the Shadows slider to the right (to darken the shadow areas of the image)
or left (to lighten up the shadow areas). 
Figure 9-15 shows the image with the shadow adjustment at a value of 9.
That value may be a little too high; clipping will be highlighted in blue as
it’s introduced in the dark areas of the image. To reduce clipping, move the
Shadows slider to the left until the blue highlight areas are minimized.
A couple of keyboard techniques come in handy here: 
 Pressing Alt (Option key on the Mac) while dragging the Exposure slider
shows you the areas of the image affected by clipping.
 Holding down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) while clicking and drag-
ging the Shadows slider will turn the Image Preview white — while show-
ing the shadow areas of the image where clipping is occurring. Figure
9-16 shows the shadows clipping display.

Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Figure 9-15: Here blue highlighting shows clipping while adjusting shadows.
Figure 9-16: Clipping shown while adjusting Shadows.

The trick to adjusting Shadows is to attempt to achieve a “true black” in your
image while minimizing any clipping in the shadow areas. Depending on the
image and exposure, you may have only limited latitude for your adjustments.
If you want an appearance of increased contrast in your image, you can always
rely on the Contrast control or the Curves control to introduce more contrast.
Use the Shadows slider to adjust the dark areas of your image to your prefer-
ence, while minimizing clipping.
Adjusting brightness
The Brightness control can be mistaken for an exposure control; actually, all
it adjusts is how bright the colors (in particular, the midtone values) are in
your image. Moving the Brightness slider to the right lightens the midtones;
moving it leftward darkens the midtone areas.
Figure 9-17 shows the Brightness adjusted to a value of 43. The Auto Adjustment
for this image actually set the Brightness value at 53, but because I like my
skies a little dark (especially blue skies!), I turned the Brightness slider down
to the left to give me that darker sky without sacrificing too much highlight in
the buildings.
Figure 9-17: Adjusting brightness.
153
Chapter 9: Processing Raw Images

154
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Increasing and decreasing contrast
Located just below the Brightness control, the Contrast control increases
the dark and light areas of your image when you move its slider to the right.
Moving the slider to the left decreases contrast in the dark and light areas of
the image. 
I often use the Contrast and Brightness controls as tools to fine-tune the
appearance of an image without affecting the overall exposure and shadows. 
For the image shown in Figure 9-18, the Auto setting was set to 21, but I
wanted to increase the contrast to darken the blue sky and lighten up the
clouds a bit. A value of 31 gave me the effect I wanted without introducing
clipping — and also without sacrificing detail in other areas of the image.
Figure 9-18: Adjusting contrast.
Adding color with the Saturation control
The Saturation control simply adds color to the image. That’s possible
because raw images don’t actually contain visible color; instead they

store color information (RGB values) for each pixel — which Camera Raw
interpolates. The result may not match what you saw (or wanted to see)
when you shot the image; when you view a raw image in Camera Raw, color
almost always needs to be increased. You can do that by using the Saturation
control to bring out the color values stored for every pixel in the image.
There isn’t an Auto check box for the Saturation control; adding color is totally
up to you. For most of my photos, a saturation setting of 20 to 30 usually gives
me the amount of color I want in my photos. Experiment with the Saturation
control to get closer to the results you want in your photos. Figure 9-19 shows
the photo I’ve been working on with the Saturation control set to a value of 30.
Increasing saturation can affect the overall white balance of an image. When
adjusting saturation, re-evaluate the color of the image and don’t be afraid to
tweak the white balance again using the Temperature control. After adding
color to the image using the Saturation control, I went back to the Temperature
slider and changed the setting from 5500 to 5350 to reduce the “warmth” in
the image (which became exaggerated when I increased the saturation).

It’s All in the Details
The controls in the Detail tab (Ctrl+Alt+2, Ô+Option+2 on a Mac) contain a
few little goodies that could easily be overlooked. Global adjustments include
the Sharpness control, Luminance Smoothing, and the Color Noise Reduction
control. 
I find the Luminance Smoothing and Color Noise Reduction controls extremely
valuable for cleaning up my images before getting them into Photoshop. 
Figure 9-20 shows the Detail tab — and yes, a new raw image! To illustrate
the controls in the Detail tab, I needed an image that needed a little help, 
so I decided to come back home from across the pond, back to the beloved
Midwest. I chose this difficult image because it’s hard to illustrate luminance
and color noise in an image — this sunset was shot at a higher ISO of 400, so
I was sure I could muster up some noise in the sky portions. (It’s an Author’s
Prerogative.)
Figure 9-20: The Detail tab, ready to “improve” a sunset.

Sharpening things up
The Sharpness control lets you apply sharpening to the preview image, the
converted image, or both. My recommendation is to apply sharpening only to
the preview, just to check for the sharpness of the image. Actual sharpening
should be applied to the actual image only after adjustments, edits, and sizing
is made to the image in Photoshop. 
The quality you get when you sharpen an image depends on its final size. If
you sharpen an image before you resize it, you could do more damage than
good, winding up with an extremely oversharpened appearance in the final
output version. If you use the Sharpness control in Camera Raw, use it only
temporarily — to add sharpness to preview images.
Here’s how to set Camera Raw’s Sharpness control to sharpen preview
images only:
1. Open Camera Raw Preferences.
Press Ctrl+K (Ô+K on a Mac) or click the Camera Raw Menu button and
select Preferences.
2. Set the Apply sharpening to
selection to “preview only.”
In the Camera Raw Preferences
window (shown in Figure 9-21),
choose Preview Images Only
from the Apply Sharpening To
drop-down list. When you make
this selection, Camera Raw
applies sharpening to preview
images only. 
Getting smooth with Luminance Smoothing
I don’t know about you, but I think the Luminance Smoothing control wins
the Photoshop “Cool Name” award for adjustments. Luminance is an interest-
ing word to begin with, but when you combine it with smoothing, you sound
impressively technical and artistic to your friends. What it does is even better.
Luminance smoothing reduces one of the two types of noise that can appear
in an image: noise contained in the grayscale areas. 
All digital camera sensors produce some sort of noise. It’s not noise like some-
one yelling at you to take out the garbage, but electrical noise: graininess
caused by an electrical field affecting the image sensor while it’s collecting
157
Chapter 9: Processing Raw Images

images only.

Part III: Working with Raw Images 
light. In most photos, you wouldn’t even notice the noise, but for those taken
at high ISO settings (400 to 1600) or long exposures, you can see the graininess
when you zoom in on your image at 100 or 200 percent (as in the area shown
in Figure 9-22). Visible noise. What a concept! And you won’t even see noise
in your viewfinder; it sneaks up on you later, like the boogie man.
Figure 9-22: Grainlike noise visible at 200-percent zoom.
The Luminance Smoothing control reduces that grainy-looking noise lurking
in the shadow parts of an image. Here’s how to use it for that purpose:
1. Zoom in 100 to 200 percent by using the Zoom tool or by pressing
Ctrl+ (Ô+ on a Mac).
2. Use the Hand tool to move the Image Preview around until you can
see a good sample of luminance noise that would usually be found
in the dark areas of the image.
3. Move the Luminance Smoothing slider to the right to reduce lumi-
nance noise (as in Figure 9-23).
For this image, I moved the Luminance Smoothing slider rightward to a
setting of 30, which reduced image noise to an acceptable level.

Figure 9-23: Reducing luminance noise.
Reducing color noise
Color noise visible in an image appears like little colored speckles in the
shadow or sky areas of certain images. 
If you’re having a tough time figuring out the difference between color noise
and luminance noise, experiment a little. Enlarge the image preview to 100 to
200 percent, and be sure to set both the Luminance Smoothing and Color
Noise Reduction sliders to 0. Move the Luminance Smoothing slider to the
right until you see the grainy-looking noise start to go away. If there is color
noise in the image, you can still see it as those pesky colored speckly thingies
(a seldom used technical term for color noise).
To reduce color noise, you don’t have to move the slider to a value of 30 or
40; sometimes only slight adjustments to a value of 3 to 7 will do the trick. 
Working with the Lens Tab
The Lens tab (press Ctrl+Alt+3 or Ô+Option+3 on a Mac) gives the pho-
tographer the power to correct imperfections that can occur due to lens
shortcomings. (Ack, wait! Don’t go throwing away your digital camera or the
lenses you bought for your digital SLR! The fact of the matter is that almost
all lenses display chromatic aberrations or vignetting from time to time.)
159
Chapter 9: Processing Raw Images

160
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
As a rule, lens shortcomings appear when you adjust your zoom to either the
extreme wide-angle or telephoto settings — or when the lens aperture is
either wide open or closed down. Today’s compact and prosumer model 
digital cameras come equipped with lenses of excellent quality, and they
only keep getting better.
If you’re going to be making large prints from your digital images or cropping
to extremes, the controls in the Lens tab (shown in Figure 9-24) may come in
handy. These are the controls for those ever-so-slight adjustments that make
your images that much closer to perfect.
Figure 9-24: The Lens tab and its controls.
Those chromatic aberrations
Chromatic aberrations occur in areas where your lens can’t focus red, green,
and blue light along edges of the image to the necessary degree of precision.
The Lens tab gives you two controls to counteract those aberrations: the Fix
Red/Cyan Fringe slider and the Fix Blue/Yellow Fringe slider.
Here’s how to use them to correct chromatic aberrations:

1. Zoom in on your image to 100 to 200 percent.
2. Using the Hand tool, move around the image to determine whether
color fringing exists.
3. If you detect red or cyan fringing on edges of the image (as illustrated
in Figure 9-24), use the Fix Red/Cyan Fringe slider to minimize it.
4. If you detect blue or yellow fringing on edges of the image, use the
Fix Blue/Yellow Fringe slider to minimize it.
Reducing vignetting
Vignetting occurs when the outer edges of the image aren’t properly exposed,
often leaving a dark circular edge around an image. Vignetting will often occur
when you shoot images with your lens set to a wide-open aperture setting.
Using a lens hood can also affect an image where the lens actually captures
the outer edges of the attachment. 
The Vignetting Amount slider is an easy way to eliminate this condition. The
photo shown in Figure 9-25 shows vignetting that occurred when this land-
scape was shot with a wide-angle lens. 
Figure 9-25: Image with some visible vignetting.
161
Chapter 9: Processing Raw Images

162
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Want to minimize the effect of vignetting on an image? Go for it:
1. Move the Vignetting Amount slider to the right to reduce the dark-
ened edges of the image.
Be careful not to overcompensate for vignetting so as to not affect any
other tonal values of the image. Overcompensating (usually by moving
the slider too far to the right) can produce light edges around the image!
To reduce the lighter-edge vignetting effect, just back off your adjust-
ment slightly by moving the slider to the left.
2. Adjust the midpoint.
The Midpoint slider helps you adjust the area in which the vignetting
effect is reduced. Move the slider to the left to shrink the area; move the
slider to the right to increase the area of your adjustment. Figure 9-26
shows vignetting reduced by adding a Vignetting Amount value of 25
and a Midpoint value of 21.
Using vignetting as 
a special effect
Though the Vignetting and Midpoint controls were
designed to reduce vignetting effects, I’ll often
take them the opposite direction — and not just
to be contrary. For years, portrait photographers
have used vignetting as a portrait effect; here I
can do that digitally: Adding a dark, graduated
border around a portrait can have a pleasing
effect on the total image, drawing attention to the
area of the photo that is most important — the
person you’ve photographed.
The Vignetting control in the Lens tab can be a
quick, easy, no-fuss way to add this effect to your
image.

Figure 9-26: Vignetting reduced.
Love Them Curves
The Curve tab (Ctrl+Alt+4, Ô+Option+4 on a Mac) provides an excellent addi-
tion for fine-tuning the distribution of tonality throughout an image. (I often
use the Curve control to add a little extra contrast.)
The Curve chart resembles a histogram: The left of the chart represents the
tonal distribution in the shadow areas of the image; the right of the chart rep-
resents the highlights areas. (See Figure 9-27.)
To adjust your images using the Curve control:
1. Select a Tone Curve setting.
I usually start out either selecting the Medium Contrast or the Strong
Contrast setting, depending on how much contrast I want to add to an
image. If I want to reduce contrast, I’ll choose the Linear setting, which is
a straight line in the curve that doesn’t change the tonality of the image.
2. Fine-tune the curve.
163
Chapter 9: Processing Raw Images

164
Part III: Working with Raw Images 
Figure 9-27: The Curve tab.
For fine-tuning the curve, either you can drag the existing curve points
or add curve points on the curve by using the Ctrl+Click technique
(Ô+Click a Mac). To fine-tune your adjustments, you can just drag a
selected curve point. You can also move a curve point by clicking it and
then clicking the up, down, right, or left arrow keys on the keyboard. 
If you really want to get precise, you can enter numeric numbers for the
selected curve points in the Input or Output fields.
Getting used to fine-tuning the tonal adjustments in the Curve tab can
take a while. If you want to make some quick curve adjustments right
away, you’ll find that the Tone Curve pre-selected settings should do the
trick for most of your photos. Experiment with the Curve tab before
messing around with the curve too much. You’ll find that subtle adjust-
ments will give you the best results.
Caught Calibrating Again!
The Calibrate tab (Ctrl+Alt+5, Ô+Option+5 on a Mac) wasn’t meant for you to
apply color correction to your images, but to fine-tune the camera profiles
that are built into Camera Raw. When updates to Camera Raw are available
(at http://adobe.com) for you to load onto your computer, typically those
updates include profiles for new models of digital camera.

When Adobe adds a new digital camera model to Camera Raw, they program
in specific color profiles for that particular model digital camera. The controls
in the Calibrate tab (see Figure 9-28) are intended to be used to fine-tune the
camera profile in Camera Raw with what your own digital camera is producing. 
Most photographers wouldn’t go through the hassle of calibrating their digital
camera to the profiles available in Camera Raw, after all, the profiles provided
work very well as they are set up now. Another reason, it’s a real hassle to
calibrate your digital camera!
To actually recalibrate the Camera Raw built-in profiles, you would have to
purchase or download a calibration target image, take a photo of it in neutral
daylight balanced lighting, then compare the image converted to ProPhoto
RGB working space with the same image in Camera Raw. You would then
have to match the colors of the text image with the photo in Camera Raw in
order to adjust the colors in the Calibrate tab — with both windows visible
on your computer monitor. If you understand all that, I think you’ll appreciate
why most of us just use the Camera Raw built-in profiles!
Although the Calibrate controls aren’t meant for applying color corrections
to photos, you can still use ’em to get some really cool color effects! The
photo shown in Figure 9-29 (for example) was first adjusted normally, using
the controls in the Adjust and Curve tab. Then I messed with it in the
Calibrate tab and added some kinky colors.

I
n those dark days before digital photographers
could shoot in raw format and take advantage
of the enlightened features of Camera Raw, we
had to make all our color and tonal adjustments
in Photoshop. (Uphill in the snow. Both ways.)
Of course, just because you’re now able to do
most of your correction work in Camera Raw 
doesn’t mean you’re exempt from tweaking color
and tone in Photoshop before you do your edits.
But okay, things are better.
One reason to know how to make levels, curves,
color balance, and saturation adjustments in
Photoshop is to accommodate the changes
you sometimes have to make in your color-
management settings, or your targeted output
media (say, a particular type of inkjet paper).
This Photoshop adjustment know-how comes in
especially handy when you want to adjust only
certain parts of an image — and (hah!) that’s some-
thing you can’t do in Camera Raw. Yet, anyway.
In this part, you get a handle on making overall cor-
rections and edits to your images — to ﬁnish what
you started in Camera Raw. I also show you how
to use adjustment layers and Layer Masks to make
even ﬁner adjustments and edits. Don’t forget:
Sometimes you still have some nagging “red eye,”
blemishes, and errant branches you need to edit
in your photos. So hang on to your hat — it’s time
to shift Photoshop into high gear!

A
djusting color and tone in Camera Raw might leave you with the feel-
ing that most of your work on an image is done — and
sometimes it is. What you’re actually accomplishing in
Camera Raw is applying basic adjustments to an image
that wasn’t processed in the digital camera, preparing
it for Photoshop (where you can go wild with it).
Chances are the photo still needs some minor color
and tonal tweaks — which is what this chapter is all
about.
Organizing those tweaks into an efficient routine is
what I call the overall-adjustments workflow: a fine-
tuning of the color and tonal corrections made in
Camera Raw, tailored to get the photos ready for
output that has a specific profile — say, a Web site or
that photo-quality glossy paper you’re loading into your
inkjet printer. 

170
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
Overall Adjustments as a Workflow
As with any other process explained in this book, this chapter explains the
overall adjustment of an image’s color and tones in Photoshop step by step —
a workflow approach. Although that process is similar for both Photoshop
and Camera Raw, making adjustments in Photoshop is more of a strictly
linear process. In particular, watch for these differences when you adjust
color and tone in Photoshop:
 Make color settings and proof before you make color and tonal cor-
rections: Yep, here it comes again: color management. In Photoshop,
you can work with images that have specific color spaces, such as
Adobe RGB (1998), and you can proof your images as you work on 
them — simulating targeted output such as an image for the Web — or 
a printed image, on a specific paper, on your inkjet printer.
After making color and tonal adjustments in Camera Raw, you’ll notice
that the actual color and tones may change in appearance when you apply
different color profiles or turn on proofing in Photoshop (check out the
example shown in Figure 10-1). In Photoshop, you’ll need to make fur-
ther overall adjustments to match your intended output. (If the building
looks familiar, it’s where The Beatles recorded “Get Back” on the rooftop
and the rest of Let It Be in the studio below. (Offhand, I think they passed
the audition.)
Figure 10-1: Proofing images changes appearance.
 Make color and tonal adjustments in layers: In Camera Raw, you make
color and tonal adjustments with the Adjust and Curve tabs. In Photoshop,
you make these corrections in individual adjustment layers (which I
explain in the “Just Layering Around” section, later in this chapter).
Default color profile
Epson premium glossy
paper profile

 Consider more options: In Camera Raw, you can adjust white balance,
exposure, shadow, brightness, contrast, saturation, and curves. You have
the same options in Photoshop (except for those great White Balance
controls in Camera Raw), plus a few more I show you in this chapter. 
Implementing color management first
Before diving into making overall corrections to your images, you’ll need to
make sure your color settings are made, and that you’re proofing your image
for the intended type of output. Working in the correct color space and proof-
ing your images as you’re making adjustments will ensure that what you’re
looking at on your computer monitor will be as close as possible to what you
will print. (I cover color management in Chapter 3; here’s where you put some
of those color-management concepts into action.)
171
Chapter 10: Adjusting Color and Tone in Photoshop
Selective color
The Selective Color adjustment (Image➪
Adjustments➪Selective Color) is supposed to be
used for CMYK color processes, but you can still
use it to adjust individual colors in a photo. Though
it’s not included in the typical overall-correction
process, it’s still useful for further tweaks when
you want to enhance (or experiment with) your
images.
I occasionally use Selective Color to adjust spe-
cific colors — enhance, lighten, darken, or
change them, without affecting the other colors
or tones in the image. I also use this adjustment
to darken a blue sky when other methods might
throw the sky color out of gamut.

Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
Here are the steps toward an overall-corrections workflow in a color-managed
environment:
1. Make sure the correct color profiles are applied.
Part of your color-management workflow, make sure that you’ll be work-
ing in the correction color space. To check which color space you’re
working in, choose Edit➪Assign
Profile. 
Figure 10-2 shows the Assign
Profile window with Working
RGB: Adobe RGB (1998) chosen.
This is a typical working space
you’ll be working in for most of
your photos. 
If the color settings made in
Camera Raw differ from those
you specified in the Camera Raw
Workflow settings to match the
color space in Photoshop, you
get a Color Settings Mismatch
message like the one shown
in Figure 10-3. At least the
Embedded Profile Mismatch
window lets you choose the pro-
file embedded with the image
(here, the Space setting chosen
in Camera Raw) or the color
space setting made in the
Photoshop Color Settings.
2. Set up proofing and proof your
colors.
If you’re processing an image
and know its final destination
(such as a particular printer,
paper, or the Web), make sure
you set up and turn on proofing.
Choose View➪Proof Setup➪
Custom. Choose the target 
profile that matches your
output destination from the
Device to Simulate drop-down
list (in the Customize Proof
Condition window shown in
Figure 10-4). 
Figure 10-4: Selecting an output profile to
simulate on your monitor.
Figure 10-2: Making sure the correct color
profile is chosen.
Figure 10-3: The Embedded Profile Mismatch
window.

If your color management is set up correctly, then choosing the correct
color space and device to simulate on your monitor should give you an
accurate view of the image as it will appear on your printer or the Web.
Any adjustments you make from here should give you results that match
what’s finally printed or displayed on the Web.
3. Turn on Gamut Warning.
Pressing Shift+Ctrl+Y (Shift+Ô+Y on a Mac) turns on Gamut Warning,
allowing you to preview areas of your image that are considered out of
gamut for the device selected in the Customize Proof Condition window.
Areas out of gamut will be highlighted in gray, as shown in the photo in
Figure 10-5.
Figure 10-5: Gamut Warning shows the out-of-gamut areas in 
an image.
When areas of your image are out of gamut, it means they’re beyond the
range of colors that the selected output device can produce. Results may
be disappointing because your printer driver translates any out-of-gamut
areas as the closest color match it can produce. If you print an image
with areas out of gamut, the colors may not match, or may appear too
dark, or too light.
Developing an overall corrections workflow
As in Camera Raw, the most efficient approach is to do your global color and
tonal corrections as a consistent, step-by-step workflow. After you get used to
making any necessary corrections in a particular order every time, you can
whip through those images, making corrections like a black-belt Photoshop
master.
173
Chapter 10: Adjusting Color and Tone in Photoshop

174
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
Now for a bird’s-eye view of an overall-correction workflow. Note the various
layers at which the procedures take place; there’s more about them in the
“Just Layering Around” section later in the chapter. Here’s the sequence:
1. Open a file from Camera Raw or Bridge.
(Okay, sometimes the obvious still has to be stated!) You can open PSD
files directly from Bridge, or open raw files from Camera Raw directly
into Photoshop. (Bridge handles the rest.)
2. Save your image in PSD format.
After opening your image from Camera Raw into Photoshop, save your
file in PSD (Photoshop) format — first into a working folder. (For more
about file management, see Chapters 4 and 5.)
3. Evaluate the image.
Instead of diving right in to make color and tonal changes in Photoshop,
take a minute to look at the open image and plan the steps necessary to
make corrections.
4. Adjust Levels.
The Levels adjustment layer is where you adjust tonal ranges and color
throughout an image’s shadows, midtones, and highlights. Photographers
find this level a useful tool for setting the white and black points of an
image, adjusting color, and removing color cast.
5. Adjust Curves.
As with the Curves control in Camera Raw, the Curves adjustment layer
is where you fine-tune how tonal values are distributed across the tonal
range of the image. This adjustment is a great way to increase or decrease
contrast — without having to adjust brightness or contrast directly.
6. Tweak Color Balance.
Adjusting color balance is another way you can fine-tune the color in an
image. Unlike the generalized color adjustments made in Camera Raw,
Photoshop Levels, and Photoshop Curves, the Color Balance adjustment
layer lets you add and subtract red, green, and blue color while main-
taining luminosity (tonal values) in an image. You’ll use the Color
Balance adjustment layer occasionally to fine-tune specific colors.
If you’ve processed your image in Camera Raw — and used the Levels
adjustment to remove any color cast — you may not need to use the
Color Balance adjustment for many of your photos. Okay, that particular
adjustment may not always add value to your workflow — but it gives
you a great secret weapon if you ever need to fine-tune the colors in
photos with finicky color balances.
Figure 10-6 shows an image with too much magenta, and the same image
corrected using the Color Balance adjustment.

Figure 10-6: Using the Color Balance adjustment to correct color in an image.
7. Adjust Brightness/Contrast.
When I first started using Photoshop, I used this adjustment a lot to
increase contrast in dull photos and adjust overall brightness if needed.
Over time, I’ve found the Brightness/Contrast adjustment to be highly
destructive. It degrades the quality of your images — especially notice-
able if you’re making prints 5×7 or larger — so I recommend only sparing
use of Brightness/Contrast in Photoshop.
If you need to adjust either brightness or contrast in your image, get in
the habit of using Curves instead of the Brightness/Contrast adjustment.
(Sneaky, sure, but it works.)
8. Adjust Hue/Saturation.
My favorite adjustment to make in Photoshop is increasing the color. I
love adding color to my photos (no melted crayons!). Now that I use the
Saturation control in my raw images when I convert them in Camera Raw,
I rely a lot less on the Photoshop version of Saturation. When processing
JPEGs from my image library (or from one of my compact digital cameras),
I rely on the Camera Raw Hue/Saturation adjustment to get me closer to
the colors I envisioned when I took the photo.
Just Layering Around
Making overall adjustments in Photoshop is different from making adjustments
in Camera Raw. In Camera Raw, adjustments are made in linear increments,
each adjustment is added to the metadata of the image, leaving the original
file intact. In Photoshop, however, these adjustments are pictured and pre-
sented in layers — you do each one as if it were on a transparent overlay
Magenta cast

Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
stacked on top of the image. Each layer represents a separate adjustment to
the original image, or background layer.
It’s kind of like making a sandwich. You start off with a piece of bread —
your original layer — and then you lay some bologna on top (another layer),
a piece of cheese (another one), some mustard (ditto), and then finally
another piece of bread, that’s the
final layer. Substitute specific adjust-
ments for those layers, and you have
the Photoshop approach to images.
(I don’t know about you, but I’m get-
ting hungry!)
Think of each layer as a transparency
that contains a specific addition. When
you open an image file in Photoshop,
the original image is used as a back-
ground layer. Add a layer to make an
adjustment; that layer is placed on top
of the background layer. Each new edit
is contained in a new layer, stacked
from the bottom on up. When the
adjustments are done, the stack is
complete — a composite image —
maybe not edible, but a finished
product.
Getting around the
Layers palette
The Layers palette is the part of
Photoshop that contains all the
layers that make up an image. It’s
where you go to create and control
all layers; you can create new ones,
hide some, and work with them indi-
vidually or in groups. Clicking the
palette’s menu button displays the
Layers menu. Figure 10-7 shows the
Layers palette and the Layers menu.
By default, the Layers palette is visi-
ble when you start Photoshop. If you
inadvertently close the Layers
palette while you’re working in
Photoshop, you can always start it
up again by choosing Windows➪
Layers or by pressing the F7 key.
Figure 10-7: The Layers palette with the Layers
menu.

Here’s a fast list of what you can do with the layers in Photoshop:
 Understanding the background layer: When you open an image file,
Photoshop creates the bottommost Background layer. Because it’s basic
to the other layers, it doesn’t allow you to make certain changes to it:
You cannot delete it, re-order it,
or change its opacity or blend-
ing mode.
Before you edit your image,
always make a duplicate of the
Background layer. It’s a best
practice to avoid editing the
Background layer altogether.
Reserve that layer as the origi-
nal to base all your edits on: It’s
your backup — your parachute
in case anything goes wrong.
Right-click (or Ô+click on a
Mac) the Background layer, and
then choose Duplicate Layer
from the menu.
 Showing or hiding a layer’s
contents: You toggle between
Show and Hide by clicking the
Eye icon (aye-aye, sir, that’s
what it looks like). If the Eye
icon is visible, the contents of
the layer are visible. If the Eye
icon is not visible, the contents
of the layer are hidden.
 Creating new layers: Click the
Create a New Layer button (see
Figure 10-8), and then choose
the layer type in the flyout
menu.
 Renaming layers: Simply double-click the layer name and type the new
name.
 Changing layer order: To change the order of your layers, click a layer
and drag it to where you want it to appear in the stack.
You can also create a new layer by dragging an existing layer to the
New Layer button, which is located on the bottom of the Layers 
palette.
177
Chapter 10: Adjusting Color and Tone in Photoshop

178
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
 Deleting layers: Click the layer
and drag it to the Trashcan icon
at the bottom-right of the Layers
palette. You can also right-click
the layer and choose Delete
Layer from the menu, as shown
in Figure 10-9.
 Flattening layers: When you flat-
ten layers, you combine them all
into one layer. When you flatten
an image, you can make no fur-
ther changes to any of the old
layers. In effect, they disappear
as layers, leaving only their
effects in the flattened version
of the image. Flattening layers is
a normal step to do right before
you print out an image or submit
it for publishing. Three things to
keep in mind here:
• If no layers are selected,
the entire image is flat-
tened into one layer that
takes the top layer’s name.
• If two or more layers are selected, only those layers are combined
into one layer — again taking the top layer’s name.
• To maintain your image edits, save your image before you flatten it —
and be sure to give the flattened version of your image a different
filename when you save it.
Creating adjustment and fill layers
Photoshop provides two sets of layers you can use to complete your image:
adjustment layers and fill layers. Though they work the same (that is, as stacks
of transparent overlays), each type of layer has its own purpose. This section
shows you how to use — and make — both types.
Laying on the adjustments
Adjustment layers are reserved for specific adjustments, and only those. They
allow you to change color or tonal values of an image and lay those changes
over your original (background) image without affecting it; you can try out
your changes till you get the ones you want. When you create an adjustment
layer, changes made in that layer are viewable along with all the adjustments
you made in the layers underneath it. You can use adjustment layers to enhance
Figure 10-9: Deleting a layer using the Layers
menu.

color balance, brightness, contrast, and saturation — and create new layers if
you need them (more about that in a minute).
An adjustment layer affects all layers beneath it in the Layers palette. The
advantage is that a change made to one adjustment layer doesn’t have to
affect the layers stacked beneath it. For example, if you want to change the
brightness of an image, you make that change only once — in one layer —
and it affects the overall image.
Filling in with fill layers
I’ve reviewed adjustment layers as the ones you create to make changes
to levels, curves, color balance, hue, and saturation. The other group of
layers, called fill layers, allow you to lay on solid colors, gradients, or pat-
terns. As with an adjustment layer, a fill layer does not affect the layers
underneath it.
Some fill layers also allow you to adjust them; here are the types of fill layers
you can use in your image-editing workflow:
 Solid color: A solid color layer is considered a fill layer. Create a solid
color layer to fill an image with
a color. You can use it to create
a colored background for an
image.
 Gradient fill layer: You can use
gradients to apply a color in a
transition from light to dark. It’s
useful for creating a dark-edged
vignette for some images or a
transitioned color background.
Figure 10-10 shows different
types of gradients. 
Gradients are used to create
some cool special effects. You
can (for example) experiment
with how your images look by
increasing or reducing the opac-
ity of a fill layer.
 Pattern fill layer: When you
create this type of layer, it con-
tains a pattern from the Pattern
menu shown in Figure 10-11.
Adjust the layer’s opacity to
strengthen or weaken the pat-
tern effect.

Making Overall Adjustments
Overall adjustments (which are introduced in Chapter 4) to an image are just
as amenable to becoming a workflow as the other processes in this book.
Here’s a look at the first five general steps of an overall-adjustment workflow:
1. Double-check your color settings before you open any image for over-
all adjustment.
2. Open an image from Camera Raw in Photoshop.
3. Save the image to PSD format in your Working folder.
4. Proof for a specific output device.
5. Evaluate your image.
• Does the image look good straight out of Camera Raw? 
• Is it too dark, too light, too flat (lack of contrast and color satura-
tion), or does it have a color cast? 
Sometimes getting an image into Photoshop and then proofing the image for
a specific device, printer, or paper will make it look different.
Evaluating images 
using Variations
One quick way to evaluate an
image is to view the image using
Variations — multiple thumbnails
of an image that open different 
versions of the image, showing 
different color balance, contrast,
and saturation. To view Variations,
choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Variations. Figure 10-12 shows
the different thumbnail choices
offered.
The Variations command is available
only for images in 8-bit-per-channel
mode. Though you can choose thumb-
nails to make adjustments, I recom-
mend using only the adjustment
layers to apply actual adjustments.
I use variations just for evaluation
purposes.
Figure 10-12: Using Variations to evaluate
images.

Adjusting levels
In my overall-adjustment workflow,
the first actual fix I make is adjusting
levels — making exact corrections 
to the tonal values of an image by
fine-tuning the colors in the high-
lights, midtones, and shadows.
To adjust colors and tone using 
the Levels command, follow these
steps:
1. Create a duplicate of the
Background layer by choosing
Layers➪Duplicate, typing a
new name into the As field 
(for example, Duplicate), and
clicking OK.
The Duplicate Layer field
appears for the purpose, as
shown in Figure 10-13.
Okay, this step really doesn’t 
fit any particular niche in my
overall-adjustments workflow —
but it is a best practice. Always
make a duplicate of the back-
ground layer before you create
any new layers.
2. Create a Levels adjustment
layer by clicking the Create
New Adjustment or Fill Layer
button from the Layer palette
(shown in Figure 10-14).
The Levels dialog box appears.
181
Chapter 10: Adjusting Color and Tone in Photoshop
Figure 10-13: Duplicating the Background layer.
Figure 10-14: Creating a Levels adjustment layer. 

182
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
3. Make sure the Preview box is
checked.
Keep the Channel selection
RGB, as shown in Figure 10-15.
You’ll be correcting levels for
the entire image — all three
color channels (Red, Green, and
Blue) at the same time.
As you become more familiar
with adjusting levels in
Photoshop, experiment with
changing the Channel selection
to the Red, Green, or Blue chan-
nels and adjusting them individ-
ually. If you are a new user of
Photoshop, keep the RGB
Channel selected.
4. View the histogram and slide
the Shadows input slider to the
right, till it gets to where the
curve of the histogram begins
(as shown in Figure 10-16).
With Preview selected, you can
view the image changes as you
move the slider. 
A histogram provides a snapshot of the tonal range of an image. The his-
togram shows how much detail is in the shadow area on the left, in the
midtones in the middle, and in the highlights on the right.
Histogram data is different for every image. For many images, the his-
togram curve begins all the way to the left, where no Shadow input-
slider adjustment is needed.
5. Slide the Highlights input
slider to the left, till it gets to
where the highlights curve
begins. 
With Preview selected, you can
view the image changes as you
move the slider, as shown in
Figure 10-17. 
Figure 10-15: The Levels adjustment window
provides controls to adjust color highlights,
midtones, and shadows.
Figure 10-16: Moving the Levels Shadows and
Highlights input sliders.
Figure 10-17: Adjusting shadows, midtones, and
highlights can improve the tonality of the image.

6. Move the Midtones input slider to the right slightly, checking the
image for improved color saturation and contrast.
Often you can improve the appearance of an image by using the 
Midtone slider to darken the midtones. If you do a lot of CMYK work for
press, you may often need to nudge the Midtone slider to the left; this
avoids images looking too dark and muddy. To be safe, always test print
your images, then review them and readjust as necessary.
7. Click OK to complete the Levels adjustment.
If you are not satisfied with the effects of your Levels adjustment, you can
reset the settings to the original values: Just press and hold the Alt key
(Option key on the Mac) and click Cancel. You can then re-create a Levels
adjustment layer and attempt to adjust levels again.
You can experiment with adjusting levels in any of the following ways — and
view the results in your image:
 Set the blackpoint of your image by clicking the Blackpoint
Eyedropper and clicking a dark part of the image. This provides a
more accurate blackpoint as a baseline for adjusting levels in your
image. (The blackpoint is an area in the image that represents a true
black.)
 Set the whitepoint of the image by clicking the Whitepoint
Eyedropper and clicking a lighter part of the image. Doing so pro-
vides a more accurate whitepoint as a baseline for adjusting levels in
your image. (The whitepoint is a portion of the image that represents
a true white.)
 Try darkening shadow areas by moving the Shadows input slider to
the right.
 Move the Midtones input slider to the left to adjust the darker mid-
tones. You can lighten midtones by moving the slider to the right.
 Increase contrast and brighten up highlights by moving the Highlights
input slider to the left.
Figure 10-18 shows the results of adjusting these levels. Moving the 
Shadow input slider to the right darkened the shadow areas, moving 
the Midtones input slider to the right darkened the midtones, and moving the
Highlights input slider to the left brightened the highlights.

Figure 10-18: The image before, and then after, adjusting levels.
How ’bout them curves?
When you adjust the tonal range of
an image using Levels, you make
only three adjustments: shadows,
midtones (gamma), and highlights.
The Curves adjustment allows for up
to 14 different points of adjustment
throughout the tonal range. 
I do mention this more than a few
times in this book, but I like to adjust
Curves instead of Brightness/
Contrast to increase contrast in my
images. Works great, not destructive
of data — what’s not to like?
To adjust an image’s tonality using
the Curves adjustment layer, follow
these steps:
1. Create a Curves adjustment
layer.
To do so, click the Create New
Adjustment or Fill Layer button
from the Layers palette and
then choose Curves, as shown
in Figure 10-19.
Before
After

2. Increase the number of grid
lines to provide a more pre-
cise grid.
Press and hold the Alt key (the
Option key on the Mac) while
clicking inside the Curves grid
to increase the number of grid
lines, as shown in Figure 10-20.
3. Make tonal adjustments by
clicking the curve line and
dragging it to the desired grid
point, or by clicking Auto.
Drag the curve upward and left
to brighten, downward and right
to darken. Experiment with cre-
ating adjustments for shadows,
midtones, and highlights.
Figure 10-21 demonstrates how the
Auto curves feature can improve
color in shadows, midtones, and
highlights.

Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
Adding color with the Hue/Saturation 
adjustment layer
The next step in the overall-adjustment workflow is to add some visual “pop”
to your image, adding color saturation to increase vibrancy and eye appeal.
With any overall adjustment, sometimes less is more; you may need to make
only a slight correction. When adjusting color saturation, for example, some-
times all you have to do is budge the slider to the right until you see the colors
pop up a little. “Easy does it” is the rule if you don’t make your images appear
unrealistic.
To create a Hue/Saturation layer,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Create New
Adjustment or Fill Layer button
from the Layers palette, and
then choose Hue/Saturation,
as shown in Figure 10-22.
The Hue/Saturation dialog box
appears.
2. Make sure Preview is selected.
You want to be sure you see
these changes before you
apply them.
3. Increase image saturation by
moving the Saturation slider
slightly to the right, as shown
in Figure 10-23. 
As a rule of thumb, increase the
saturation until you see the
colors start to pop. 
Be careful not to add too much
color saturation; it can make
certain colors in the image blow
out — that is, lose detail as
they’re overpowered by the
color. If some areas look blown
out, back off your adjustment
slightly until you’re pleased
with the result.
Figure 10-22: Creating a Hue/Saturation layer.

Figure 10-23: Increasing saturation in the Master channel.
You can use the Hue/Saturation adjustment layer to adjust individual
color hues or saturation amounts. This is an advanced method of 
color-correcting your images. Experiment with changing the hue and/or
saturation of each color to see the result. You may find that adjusting
the Master (the default setting) alone can work just fine for your photos.
4. Check Gamut Warning by choosing View➪Gamut Warning. 
For the photo of the fire engine, I actually had to decrease some satura-
tion in the Red channel to bring the image more within the gamut of my
selected output (but then I punched up some other colors).
5. Click OK to save your settings.
Figure 10-24 shows the original fire-engine image, with Levels and Curves
added, and then with Hue/Saturation adjusted. The photo now appears
slightly more vibrant — but not overprocessed — and that’s what you’re
shooting for.

 Making specific edits
 Using Layer Masks to make selective changes
A
fter you convert an image from raw to Photoshop and make overall cor-
rections to color and tone, you’re about half done with the image. With
many photos, you still have to edit — make improvements that are unique to
the image, such as removing “red eye,” fixing dust spots (digital SLRs can get
’em from dirty image sensors), or erasing those power lines you
didn’t see when you were shooting outdoors.
There are other traditional photographic tricks us old-
school darkroom wizards used to do, such as dodging
and burning. The editing phase is also the time that
you can let your artistic intentions run wild, using an
array of Photoshop special effects — in particular,
filters, which I cover in more detail in Chapter 14.
This is always one of my favorite subjects to talk
about, so let’s get into some Photoshop editing!
Using an Image-Editing Workflow
Typically an effective image-editing workflow is put together
much like the overall-correction workflow I describe in Chapter 10.
Here, too, I encourage you to make your image edits in a step-by-step

190
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
sequence of best practices. Unlike the procedure for overall color and tonal
corrections, however, you do have the freedom to mix up the order of your
edits a bit. But I still like consistency, so I take these edits in individual steps:
1. Plan your edits.
After you complete overall corrections, evaluate your image to deter-
mine what type of edits if any are needed. Common types of edits to plan
for include these:
a. Dodging and burning.
Dodging is a technique you use to lighten a certain area of an
image; burning darkens a certain area of an image. Whether you’re
working on landscape, still life, portraits, or photos of your pets,
evaluate your images to see if areas need to be dodged (like when
you want your dogs eye’s to be more bright), or burned (like when
you need to darken areas of a landscape).
Dodging and burning areas of an image can rescue out-of-gamut
parts of an image and bring them back into a printable range. (For
more about out-of-gamut colors, see Chapter 10.)
b. Removing spots.
Dust spots on digital images aren’t really possible for images taken
with compact digital cameras because the lens is built into the
camera. But when you’re shooting with digital SLRs, dust spots can
happen when particles find their way onto your image sensor. It’s
happened to me, and is fairly common for digital SLR shooters.
On a recent trip to England, I had the opportunity to stop off at this
one interesting spot to take photos of some big stones sticking out
of the ground. I slapped a circular polarizer on my lens to get some
darker blue skies and to reduce the glare off the stones. To my
later dismay, I discovered (while zooming in on those photos in
Photoshop) spots in the sky caused by water spots on my circular
polarizer. I called up the trusty Healing Brush tool and used it to
remove those spots, as shown in Figure 11-1.
c. Retouching.
Nature is not always kind. Time and again, the people whose por-
traits I take want to make sure I get rid of the wrinkles, pimples,
and blemishes we all seem to have. No problem: When editing
images in Photoshop, you can soften skin using the Blur tool or
one of the blur filters. You can use the Dodge tool or Paintbrush to
help whiten teeth and eyes. (If you get good at retouching por-
traits, you can save your friends and clients some money: They
won’t have to go to a plastic surgeon for a facelift or the dentist to
get teeth whitened — provided they never venture out.)

Figure 11-1: Removing spots with the Healing Brush tool.
If you’re shooting portraits, retouching in Photoshop is an impor-
tant phase of your work. Plan your edits carefully.
d. Sharpening.
To make a general statement, all digital images need some sharpen-
ing. Sharpening should be the last step you take before printing
a photo or posting it to the Web. I show you more about sharpen-
ing in the next chapter, but I’m mentioning it here because sharp-
ening is considered an image edit.
Figure 11-2 shows a zoomed portion of the photo of those stones
in the ground before — and after — sharpening with the Unsharp
Mask filter. (I didn’t see any Druid sacrifices there that day, but I
did have to sacrifice my lunch hour so I could take the time to
shoot some photos.)

2. Create separate layers for each edit.
After you evaluate an image, and then decide (say) to dodge it, then
burn it, and then make the cigarette butts disappear from its floor, do each
of those edits in its own layer. That way you can delete layers whose edits
just didn’t do the job, without affecting other image-editing layers.
Here’s the fast way to create an editing layer:
a. Create a new layer.
Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E or Ô+Shift+Option+E on a Mac to merge
a copy of all visible layers into a new target layer. (Run out of 
fingers yet?)
By combining all the previous layers into the new layer, you’re
essentially merging all the adjustment layers and other edits you’ve
made so far. Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E (Ô+Shift+Option+E on a Mac) to
combine the previous layers into your new editing layer.
b. Give the layer a proper name.
For example, if you’re creating a new layer to use the Healing
Brush to remove spots on your image, give the layer a descriptive
name (such as “Healing Brush Edits”). After you create the layer,
double-click the layer name in the Layers palette, and type in a
new name like the example shown in Figure 11-3.
Not sharpened
Sharpened with Unsharp Mask

If you use the Merge Visible
command (Layers➪Merge
Visible), you wind up flat-
tening all the visible layers
into one layer. That’s not a
good idea if you want to
preserve all your changes
in separate layers. Instead
of using the Merge Visible
command, press Shift+
Ctrl+Alt+E (Shift+Ô+
Option+E on a Mac) to
retain all the previous
layers but to merge those
layers into the one you just
created. Now you’re ready
to make an edit!
After you’ve created your first
editing layer and combined all
the visible layers into that layer,
you can simply duplicate the
new layer for whatever new edit
you want to perform next.
3. Edit your image.
Now that you have a fresh newly
“merged” layer to work on, go
ahead and remove a blemish,
whiten some teeth, and dodge
or burn parts of the image to
see how those features work.
Keep each edit to its own layer.
If you start by removing a blemish and then decide you want to dodge or
burn some other part of the image, create a new layer first (by choosing
Layer➪Duplicate Layer).
Getting to Know Your Tools
When working with images and making edits in Photoshop, many of the graphic
tools you’ll be using are accessed from the Photoshop Toolbox. The Toolbox,
shown in Figure 11-4, includes more than 60 tools to manipulate and edit your
photos.
Just as an artist carries an assortment of pencils, brushes, erasers, and a few
other tools in an art-supply box, you have the same arsenal at your disposal.
The Toolbox includes all the drawing and painting tools the artist can’t do
without — plus a few others that a digital artist can’t do without (such as the
Red Eye Removal tool, the Healing Brush, and the Magic Wand tool).

(see Figure 11-5).
Using the Marquee tool is a quick
way to make edits to the selection,
or even to crop part of an image:
1. Select the Marquee tool.
2. Draw a marquee around the image portion you want to crop.
3. Make edits to the selection.
If you simply want to crop the selection, choose Image➪Crop to crop the

Chapter 11: Editing Images
The Lasso tool
The Lasso tool is essential for
making selections within parts of an
image — and editing just those areas
you’ve selected. The Lasso tool
flyout menu, shown in Figure 11-6,
offers three tools for creating selec-
tions: the Lasso tool, the Polygonal
Lasso tool, and the Magnetic Lasso
tool. (See the “Lasso this!” section, later in this chapter, for more about the
Polygonal Lasso and Magnetic Lasso tools.)
The Lasso tool is commonly used to make selections in an image that can be
easily traced; it’s like drawing an outline on tracing paper placed over a pic-
ture. Select the Lasso tool, and then — while holding down the left mouse
button — trace over the part of the image you want to select. 
Snip-snipping with the Crop tool
The Crop tool is as simple as an artist’s mat knife: You draw a boundary
around the parts of your image in which you want to crop, as shown in
Figure 11-7. You can specify the width and height of your crop as well as
the resolution you want to make the cropped image.

Editing with the Healing Brush
Some of the coolest editing tools
that Photoshop offers are the
Healing Brush tools. The flyout menu
shown in Figure 11-8 includes four
Healing Brush tools that enable you
to correct minor details. Imagine
eliminating pimples, hair, and dust
from all the places you don’t want
them. (Digitally, at least.)
 Spot Healing Brush tool: New in CS2, this tool is easier to use than the
Healing Brush tool. Just select the Spot Healing Brush and start painting
areas to retouch. Because the tool samples surrounding pixels for you,
you don’t have to worry about making a selection.
 Healing Brush tool: With this tool, you can sample a selection of pixels,
and then paint those selected pixels onto other areas. Using this tool is a
great way to retouch areas of your images.
 Patch tool: This works similar to how the Healing Brush tool works. The
difference is, with the Patch tool, you’re actually making a selection of
an area to use for painting in the selected pixels. 
 Red Eye tool: Also new in CS2, this handy little tool provides a quick way
to remove that ghoulish “red eye” from your cherished photos.
Cloning around with the Clone Stamp tool
The Clone Stamp tool is the equiva-
lent of a rubber stamp (you know —
press a stamp on an ink pad and
then on paper), only it’s digital: 
You sample part of an image (color,
texture, whatever) and apply that
sample elsewhere in the image. 
All Brush tips work with the Clone
Stamp tool, so it’s a great retouching alternative. One of its special versions,
the Pattern Stamp tool, re-creates patterns from the cloned selection and
applies to another part of the image. Figure 11-9 shows the Clone Stamp
tool’s flyout menu.
Removing pixels with the Eraser tool
The Eraser tool is the digital equivalent of those pink erasers at the ends of
pencils. You can erase pixels as you move the cursor over them, changing
them in ways specified in the Eraser mode you choose on the Option bar. 
Figure 11-8: Healing Brush tools.
Figure 11-9: The Clone and Pattern Stamp
tools.

Use the Background Eraser tool to
remove the effects of overall image
adjustments (see Chapter 10) made
to only certain areas or layers of the
image. To erase all similar pixels
within a layer, use the Magic Eraser
tool. Among the tools shown in
Figure 11-10 are the Background
Eraser and Magic Eraser.
Sharpen or blur with the Blur tool
The Blur tool can be a quick way to
edit a too-sharp edge by blurring a
portion of your photo, in much the
same way you’d use the Sharpen tool
to add crispness. If you are editing a
portrait and want to get a blurred
effect, you can make an overall
adjustment to the photo using the
Gaussian Blur filter — but then use
the Sharpen tool selectively to
sharpen hair and eyes. Figure 11-11
shows the Blur tool’s flyout menu.
The Smudge tool warps and pushes pixels in the direction you are dragging
the tool, giving you a morphing or smudge effect. Like the Liquefy filter, the
Smudge tool enables you to hide flaws or achieve some really cool special
effects.
Drawing shapes with the Pen tool
The Pen tool actually does a wee bit
more than a pen you use to write love
letters, shopping lists, and checks.
The Pen tool in Photoshop creates
lines, curves, and shapes (also called
vector paths) for a variety of editing
and drawing purposes. The Pen tool
flyout menu (shown in Figure 11-12)
shows its different options — includ-
ing the Freeform Pen tool and a vari-
ety of anchor-point Pen tools.
Load up an image and experiment with the Pen and Freeform Pen tools. The
Pen tools offer a valuable way to create special effects when you want to
make complex selections.

Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
Making selections with the Magic Wand tool
One of the most valuable editing tools in the Toolbox is the Magic Wand. You
can use it to make selections — one of the most widely used processes in
editing images — for example, to select similarly colored areas in your photo.
You can specify the color range and tolerance for a selected area by using the
Option bar to set them.
Selections are used to select contigu-
ous and discontiguous areas of an
image so you can make edits specifi-
cally to that area selected. For
instance, if you want to select only
the clouds in an image of sky, use the
Magic Wand tool to select only the
white areas (the clouds, which are
discontiguous) and not the blue (the
sky). I often use the Magic Wand tool
to select portions of the backgrounds
in my portraits so I can lighten,
darken, or even blur those areas to
get the effect I want. Another way I
use selections is to isolate — and 
fix — areas of my image that are out
of gamut. I want the whole image to
match the gamut range of my selected
printer and paper combination,
but I don’t want to change the entire
image — just the areas that are out 
of gamut.
Figure 11-13 shows the Magic Wand tool used to select a section of an image
that is overexposed relative to the rest of the image. I selected that portion
so I could adjust its brightness to match the rest of the image.

Dodging and burning using Dodge and Burn tools
One of the most common edits that
discerning digital photographers
make in Photoshop is dodging and
burning. Back in the day when 
photographers like me developed
photos using enlargers and chemi-
cals, I had a few tricks up my sleeve
to touch up my work. Dodging and
burning allowed me to darken or
lighten certain areas of a print to my
liking by either reducing or increas-
ing exposure to certain parts of the print. Photoshop lets old-timers like me
do those same things with the Dodge and Burn tools shown in Figure 11-16.

tools.

Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
The Sponge tool is useful when you want to make slight color-saturation
adjustments to an area. For example, you can decrease the color saturation
of a certain area where the red may be too bright or “blown out,” giving an
unnatural look to the photo. The Sponge tool can also come in handy to help
bring out-of-gamut areas of your image back into a color range that your
printer can handle.
Writing text with the Type tools
Used most often by graphic design-
ers who combine both text and
images in their everyday work, the
Horizontal and Vertical Text tools,
shown in Figure 11-17, are methods
to insert text into an image. Add text
to your photos in just three steps:
1. Click the Horizontal Type tool
in the Toolbox.
2. Choose the font you want to use.
New in CS2 is the ability to view WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-
get) samples of each font by clicking the Font menu located on the
Option bar, as shown in 11-18.
Figure 11-18: Choosing a font and font size on the Option bar.
Figure 11-17: Type tools let you add text to an
image.

3. Click your image and type the
text.
For my photography Web
site, http://kevinmoss
photography.com, I always type
a description, name, or location
for each photo on my site. I use
the Text tool to easily add the
text to my image canvas. After
you type some text, you can
move it around with the Move
tool and place it exactly where
you want it, as shown in
Figure 11-19.
Shaping things up with
the Shape tools
For situations when you want to draw
simple shapes (or insert predefined
shapes into your photos or canvas),
the Photoshop Toolbox offers Shape
tools to do just that. Figure 11-20
shows all the Shape tools available in 
the Rectangle tool flyout menu.
Suppose I want to insert a copyright
symbol next to my text for the Orchid art
poster example I used in the previous 
section. The process for adding this
symbol is as follows:
1. Right-click (single-click on the Mac)
the Rectangle tool and choose the
Custom Shape tool.
2. Choose the copyright symbol from
the Option bar Shape selection
menu shown in Figure 11-21.
3. Drag the Custom Shape tool over the
part of your image where you want
to insert the symbol, as shown in
Figure 11-22.

Zooming in and out
The Zoom tool provides one of many ways to
enlarge or shrink your view of the details in an
image: Click the Zoom tool, place your cursor over
your image, and click. You can also right-click
(Option+click on a Mac) with your mouse and
choose Zoom Out to reverse your zoom, as shown
in Figure 11-23.
Other methods for zooming in and out of an image
include using the Navigator palette or pressing
Ctrl+/-. On a Mac, the preferred method for zoom-
ing in is to press Spacebar+Ô+Click; to zoom out,
press Spacebar+Ô+Option+Click.
Using tool presets
One timesaving feature of Photoshop is that you
can set up tools the way you like them. You work
with these every day, so it’s nice to have some of
Figure 11-23: Right-click in the
image to view the Zoom tool’s
options.

them set up with your own cus-
tomized settings and shortcuts.
When you save settings for com-
monly used tools in Photoshop, you
create tool presets.
I prepare a lot of photos for print
and for the Web. One set of presets
I use on a regular basis is my crop
settings — for both my Web site and
for printing. I create crop presets
including 11×14 inches at 360dpi for
prints and 4×5 inches at 72dpi for the
Web. Then I save these crop settings
as presets so I don’t have to go in
and manually specify a crop setting
every time I want to crop an image.
Other common presets to consider
are for Brush sizes, frequently used
fonts, and font sizes. As you become
more familiar with Photoshop and
really nail down your everyday image-
editing workflow, try setting up your common tools
using the Tool Presets palette shown in Figure 11-24.
The Tool Presets palette offers some useful features
for creating presets:
 You can drag the Tool Presets palette from the
Palette well to your image window.
 If you need to view all presets instead of the
presets for the tool selected, uncheck the
Current Tool Only check box. Re-check Current
Tool Only to view only the presets for the
selected tool.
 You can organize presets by tool type, delete
presets, or change the way presets are dis-
played. To do so, use the Preset Manager
located in the Tool Presets flyout menu.
To set up a tool preset, follow these steps:
1. Click the tool in the Toolbox that you want to
create a preset for.
In Figure 11-25, I’m selecting the Crop tool.

Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
2. Make the settings to the tool that you want to preset. 
For the Crop tool preset, I created a crop size of 19×13 inches at 360dpi
in the Crop tool options on the Option bar, as shown in Figure 11-26.
Figure 11-26: Making a preset for Crop settings.
3. Click the Tool Presets palette
in the Palette well, and click
to save the tool settings
made in Step 2 as shown in
Figure 11-27.
You can also access the tool
presets by clicking the tool button on the far-left of the Option bar or by
choosing Window➪Tool.
4. Type a name for the tool that you’re saving.
Photoshop creates a default name for your preset that you can cus-
tomize to your liking.
As you can see, there are a number of ways to open the Tool Presets palette
and create tool presets that can save you editing time.
Making Selections
If you’re editing photos that look just fine for the most part, often you want to
change only certain parts of them. Photoshop offers a variety of tools to
make selections — defined, editable areas within an image. When you make a
selection in Photoshop, you can then edit only that part of the image, without
changing the rest. Getting familiar with these capabilities — especially the
editing of selections — is necessary if you want to edit your individual
images with consistent quality. To keep that quality, the larger goal is to set
up an image-editing workflow for your photos.
Selecting only certain parts of your images — and editing only those selected
parts with tools covered in this chapter — gives you great creative control.
You can replace a dull background with a vibrant color, darken a bright sky,
brighten a dark sky, and selectively sharpen or blur a part of your image to
get the desired effects.
Figure 11-27: Naming and saving the preset.

Making selections with the Magic Wand tool
The Magic Wand tool is probably the most popular selection tool used to
make the most common selections in photos. I often use the Magic Wand to
select areas of an image that are similar in color if I want to make color or
tonal changes to only the selected areas.
The typical process for making — and then adjusting — a selection looks
like this:
1. Create a new layer by choosing Layer➪Duplicate Layer. 
2. Select part of the image you want to modify using the Magic Wand tool. 
I use the Magic Wand tool to select backgrounds in images that I want to
change. I can lighten or darken the background, replace the background
with parts from another image, or blur the background. Whichever
adjustment I want to use, I have to separate the subject from the back-
ground before I make my edits.
The Magic Wand tool works best when the area you’re selecting is one
color (or close to one color) and has distinct boundaries from the
remaining area.
The Magic Wand tool works just as well as a way to select the subject of an
image instead of the background. Select the background and then choose
Select➪Inverse to swap the selections for the rest of the image.
The amount of feathering deter-
mines how sharp or smooth the
edges of the selection are. For the
image in Figure 11-28, I applied
a Feather radius of 2 pixels
by choosing Select➪Feather
(Ctrl+Alt+D or Ô+Option+D
on the Mac) and then typing 2
in the Feather Radius field
in the Feather Selection window.
3. Apply corrections to the image. 
For the landscape in Figure
11-28, I adjusted the color and
tone of the grass without adjust-
ing color and tone for the rest 
of the image. The image was
shot with direct sunlight, 
which “washed out” some of 
the color of the grass area. I
chose Image➪Adjustments➪
Hue/Saturation and then turned
up the saturation of the Yellow and Green channels to get the effect
I wanted — without affecting the sky or the old building.
205
Chapter 11: Editing Images
Figure 11-28: Making selective adjustments. 

206
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
Putting a twist on the whole concept of selecting just one part of the image,
I then wanted to adjust the color of the sky. So I chose Select➪Inverse
(Shift+Ctrl+I, Shift+Ô+I on a Mac) to reverse the selection from where it was
to the rest of the image. I then chose Image➪Adjustments➪Hue/Saturation
and tweaked the Blue channel to get the sky the way I wanted it. Figure 11-29
shows the finished product.

Chapter 11: Editing Images
Using rulers and grids
Photoshop offers the capability to precisely
position elements of your images. Rulers, grids,
and guides are used to map out your photos,
allowing you to make edits in a measured envi-
ronment. The combination of these precision
tools with the Snap-To feature lets you navigate
precisely with your mouse or tablet’s stylus.
You can apply rulers to your image window, pro-
viding measurements along the left and top of
your image window. Applying grids to an image
adds horizontal and vertical lines in your image
window to better help you navigate. Guides pro-
vide horizontal and vertical lines to your specifi-
cation in the image window. Hold down the Alt
(Windows)/Option (Mac) key as you’re dragging
a guide to switch the guide’s orientation 90
degrees.
I use rulers to help me make precision crops to
images when the Crop tool just doesn’t cut it (no
pun intended). To bring up rulers in your image
window, choose View➪Rulers or press Ctrl+R
(Ô+R on the Mac). You can change the actual
units of measure on the ruler from inches to cen-
timeters (or other units) by right-clicking the
ruler (Ô+clicking the Mac); see the image on
the left here for an example.
Using grids in your image window allows you to
make more precise edits to your image. Grids
are nonprinting lines you can add to your image
by choosing View➪Show➪Grid. The image on
the right shows an image window with grids
turned on.

Lasso this!
Seeing the Magic Wand tool at work might make you wonder what other
selection tools Photoshop has in its bag of tricks. The three lasso tools are
used to create finer selections in your image:
 Lasso tool: Used for free-form drawing of selections, such as the one
shown in the upper-left image of Figure 11-30. I chose this selection so I
could edit out the selected yucky spot on the peach without affecting
the rest of the image. (I like my fruit to be perfect — no worms!)
 Magnetic Lasso tool: Best used to trace more complex shapes. The
selection marquee (the dotted line surrounding your selection) snaps to
the selection like metal to a magnet when you use this tool. If you want
to select (for example) the entire orange, the Magnetic Lasso tool
(shown in the upper-right image of Figure 11-30) does a more accurate
selection than the other Lasso tools. 
 Polygonal Lasso tool: Used for drawing straight edges of a selection, the
Polygonal Lasso tool is great for making selections like the one shown in
the bottom image in Figure 11-30, where the areas to select are shapes
that have straight lines (such as boxes, rectangles, triangles, or windows).
Figure 11-30: Selecting an area of an image you want to edit separately from the rest of the image.

You can always get rid of a selection if you want to start over by choosing
Select➪Deselect or by clicking Ctrl+D (Ô+D on the Mac) to deselect your
selection.
Selection options
When you make selections with
any tools, options are available to
make your selections more precise.
Figure 11-31 shows the Select menu,
which provides functionality to help
you work with selections.
The most commonly used options in
the Select menu include these:
 All: Use this command to select
the entire image. You can also
use the shortcut Ctrl+A (Ô+A on
the Mac).
 Deselect: Choose Deselect to
remove the selection outline
you have made. When making
selections you often have to
deselect in order to start over to
make the correct selections. You
can also use the keyboard short-
cut Ctrl+D (Ô+D on the Mac).
 Inverse: Sometimes you want to
select an area that’s tricky, com-
plex, or otherwise just tough to
select. If you’re lucky, the rest of
the image may be easier to
select; if that’s the case, select
the easier area — and then
choose Select➪Inverse. The
Inverse command reverses your
selection, selecting the previ-
ously unselected portion of
your image.
 Feather: Choose this command, and then indicate the number of pixels.
A feather of two or three pixels provides a smooth, realistic edge for
your selections in many photos. Experiment with setting the feature to
different numbers of pixels until you find the right setting for your
photo. To feather a selection, choose Select➪Feather or press Ctrl+Alt+D
(Ô+Option+D on the Mac).
209
Chapter 11: Editing Images
Figure 11-31: The Select menu provides
additional commands to use when making
selections.

210
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
 Grow: When you choose the Grow command, you can increase the con-
tiguous areas of your selection to include areas that are similar in color.
To grow a selection, choose Select➪Grow.
 Similar: The Similar command increases your selection to all like colors
of the current selection, regardless of their place in the image. To
expand a noncontiguous selection with similar colors, choose Select➪
Similar.
Before you can use the Select commands, you must have actual selections
made in your image. And it bears repeating: Make sure you duplicate the back-
ground layer before making selections. Selections can be cumbersome, but
with practice, you can become more proficient.
Editing Techniques
Many photos have imperfections that you would rather do without — and
here it’s no fault of the photographer: Unnoticed (or immovable) power lines,
oddities of contrast, dust specks, and even flies can find their way into
images. When you view the photos later on a computer, you may want to
change the imperfections that bug you (pun intended). Or some details stick
out when vagueness would be more forgiving. (I don’t know about you, but
I’ve found that digital cameras can capture a lot better resolution than my
own eyes can!) When you’re taking photos of people, keep in mind that some
folks don’t want the sharpness today’s digital cameras can deliver. After all,
who wants to see all the pores or wrinkles on someone’s face? 
Worm holes in a peach? You can fix that. Pimples on a teenager? You can fix
that, too (on-screen anyway). Power lines running across your horizon? You
have an editing trick for that too!
Getting the red (eye) out
One of the most common complaints I hear about photos of people is the
“red eye” effect: Bright red dots in the center of the subjects’ eyes detract
from the rest of the image.
The digital cure for those devilish eyes is now literally one click away: the
new Photoshop Red Eye tool. Here’s how to use it:
1. After opening your image, duplicate the background layer by choos-
ing Layer➪Duplicate Layer or pressing Ctrl+J (Ô+J on the Mac).

Your loved ones will thank 
you for fixing this problem.
Unfortunately for me, I had to
pick a family photo that had the
red-eye problem so I could
demonstrate it here; it’s not
easy to get a loved one to agree
to that. (Can’t think why. Oh
well. Disclaimer: The photo in
Figure 11-33 has been cropped
to hide the identity of the test
red-eye subject.)
2. Zoom in on the subject’s eyes
by pressing Ctrl+ (on a Mac,
Spacebar+Ô+click) a few times
until the eyes are large enough
to edit.
3. Click the Red Eye tool in
the Toolbox, as shown
in Figure 11-32.
4. Drag a box around the red por-
tion of the eye to remove the
red, as shown in Figure 11-33.
If all the red is not removed,
drag the marquee over the eye
again and let go of the mouse
button. Repeat the process for
both eyes. Figure 11-34 shows
the effects of using the Red Eye
tool.

Removing spots
You may think that with today’s digital cameras, dust spots are a thing of the
past. That’s not necessarily so. Digital SLRs use interchangeable lenses; when
you change these lenses, dust can sneak into the camera and onto the image
sensor — and you have digital dust spots. Fortunately, the Spot Healing
Brush tool offers a digital remedy.
Finding a photograph to use as an example of how the Spot Healing Brush
tool eliminates blemishes was hard to do; not many models would approve of
a page or two about their imperfections! But a landscape can’t argue — so I
use one here to show you how to fix dust spots with the Spot Healing Brush
tool.
Might as well get right to it: Figure 11-35 shows a photo that contains a dust
spot that has to be removed.
Here’s how to remove a portion of the image, such as a blemish or a dust spot:
1. Create a new layer to use for editing: Press Shift+Ctrl+Alt+E
(Ô+Shift+Option+E on a Mac) to create a new target layer with all
of your previously visible layers combined. 
If you’ve taken this step before to do another edit, just duplicate the 
previous layer by pressing Ctrl+J (Ô+J on a Mac), or select the layer to
duplicate and Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
2. If needed, zoom in on the portion of the image that includes the blem-
ish, dust spot (as in the example shown), or unwanted pixels.
To zoom in, you can use the Zoom tool or just press Ctrl+ (on a Mac,
press Spacebar+Ô+click to zoom in).
3. From the Photoshop Toolbox, right-click the Healing Brush tool and
choose the Spot Healing Brush tool (see Figure 11-36). 
4. Adjust the size of your brush so it’s just a little larger than the spot
you want to remove.
Enlarge the brush size by pressing the right-bracket key (]) or reduce
the brush size by pressing the left-bracket key ([).
5. Drag the brush over the dust spot while holding down your mouse
button, and then let go of the mouse button.
Figure 11-37 shows the image before and after I removed the spot from it.

The Healing Brush tool works the
same way as the Spot Healing Brush,
with one exception: Using the
Healing Brush tool, you can pick the
sample of pixels it uses to replace
what’s in the area you paint. To
select an area to clone pixels from,
press Alt+click (Option+click on a
Mac) that area.

Dodging and burning to make your images pop
Going back to the old days of printing in a darkroom, one of the only tricks I
had up my sleeve to edit prints was to dodge and burn. Dodging was the
process of blocking light from certain portions of the photographic paper as
it was being exposed, reducing light to that part of the image. The result was
a lightening of the area.
Burning was a technique used to add light to certain areas of the image that I
wanted to be darker than the rest of the image. If I wanted part of the back-
ground darker, I burnt it. If I wanted a petal of a flower lighter, I dodged it.
It wasn’t an exact science, and I couldn’t see the results of my efforts until the
print came out of the chemical process, washed and dried. Worse yet, I had
to dodge or burn each print individually to have the same effect across all
prints. Multiple copies of the same print meant multiple dodges and multiple
burns — a long, hard process. With Photoshop, you can edit your images,
dodge and burn each image once, and print as many as you want.
Here’s a hands-on look at dodging and burning your images:
1. Create a new layer to edit your image. 
Create the new target layer with the other visible layers combined by
pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E (Ô+Shift+Option+E on the Mac).
2. Evaluate the image.
Look at the photo to evaluate which areas you want to darken and which
you want to lighten. (If you haven’t noticed yet, one of my favorite sub-
jects to photograph is stuff found in backyards — such as butterflies and
birds. They’re great models, don’t complain, and they like to fly around
and pose for photos.)
3. If necessary, zoom in on the portions of the image you want to darken
or lighten with the Zoom tool. Then click (first) the Zoom tool in the
Photoshop Toolbox and (next) the image.
Press Ctrl+ to zoom in on your images. Press Ctrl– to zoom back out. On
the Mac, zoom in by pressing Spacebar+Ô+Click; zoom out by pressing
Spacebar+Ô+Option+Click.
4. Click and hold the mouse button over the Dodge tool or press Shift+O
a few times to get to the tool you want to use.
Use the Dodge tool to lighten areas or use the Burn tool to darken areas.
215
Chapter 11: Editing Images

Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
5. Make your brush larger by pressing the ] key to enlarge the brush or
the [ key to reduce the size of the brush.
You can also choose a softer brush by choosing the Brush Preset Picker
on the Option bar. Using a softer-edged brush can reduce the harsh
edges that can appear with burning or dodging.
6. Choose the Burn tool to make the light areas you want to darken.
7. From the Option bar, experiment with different Brush and Exposure
settings. 
I usually accept the defaults and make sure my Exposure setting is
around 35 percent. You can dodge and burn Highlights, Midtones, and
Shadows by making those individual selections in the Option bar, as
shown in Figure 11-38.
Figure 11-38: Adjusting the Brush and Exposure settings.
8. Choose the Dodge tool to make the dark areas of the image brighter.

ing (in that order) can help make your image more correct in high-
contrast areas.

Using Layer Masks
One of the more advanced features of Photoshop separates the casual user
from the serious user: Layer Masks. These specialized layers let you hide or
expose specific parts of a layer by painting the portions you want to hide —
or emphasize or expose — with the Paintbrush tool.
You have many ways to accomplish the same task in Photoshop. Using Layer
Masks is just one of many techniques you can use to hide portions of images
and replace with other effects, layers, or adjustments. Some pretty slick uses
of Layer Masks include these:
 Creating a layer in a portrait to blur or soften the subject’s skin (a 
portrait-editing technique). With most portraits, the subjects don’t
want to see their wrinkles, pores, or blemishes! Many photographers use
techniques such as a Gaussian blur to blur the flaws, but then paint in
the sharpened portions of the portrait (such as hair and eyes) that they
do not want blurred.
 Creating a Layer Mask to selectively paint in the effects of an overall
adjustment, blur, or sharpening. Using Layer Masks is a common tech-
nique for retouching photographs selectively.
 Selectively darkening a background. Darken the entire image using 
the Hue/Saturation Lightness slider to the level where the background is
darkened to your liking. (Don’t worry! You can create a Layer Mask and
then paint back in the areas that you don’t want darkened.)
 Replacing the background of an image by masking a selection from an
image.
The following steps give you a detailed taste of the Layer Mask’s power,
showing you how to use one to hide the sharp portions of a blurred image
and then selectively “paint back in” the parts of the image you want to
remain sharp. You can apply many such effects and filters, and then use
Layer Masks to selectively paint in the effects. I call this process the “Bad Tie
Day” effect.
1. Make a duplicate of the image’s background layer by choosing
Layer➪Duplicate Layer or pressing Ctrl+J (Ô+J on the Mac).
Provide descriptive names to your layers when you create them. You
can change the layer name by clicking the layer name in the Layers
palette and typing in the new text.
2. Blur the image by choosing Filters➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
Try a blur setting from one to four, as shown in Figure 11-40.
217
Chapter 11: Editing Images

218
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
3. Create a Layer Mask by choosing
Layer➪Layer Mask.
Choose the Reveal All option in the
flyout menu to fill the layer with
white, allowing the effects of the
layer adjustment to show through.
Choosing the Hide All option in the
flyout menu paints the layer with
black to hide the effects of the
Gaussian Blur layer adjustment.
For this example, I’ve chosen
Reveal All.
The Reveal All option lets the effects
of the Gaussian Blur continue to
show in the image, as shown in
Figure 11-41. Choose this option to
paint the areas to hide the Gaussian
Blur effect. Choosing the Hide All
option hides the Gaussian Blur
effect, allowing you to use a Paint-
brush tool to paint in the areas of
the image where you want the
Gaussian Blur effect.
4. Click the Paintbrush tool in the
Photoshop Toolbox.
Press D to set the foreground color
to white and the background color
to black. The D key always changes
these back to the Photoshop default
colors (hence the D): white for fore-
ground and black for background.
Press X to reverse these colors.
Using black as the foreground color
in the Reveal All mode paints away
the Layer Mask; using white as the
foreground color paints the Layer
Mask back in.
5. Lower the opacity to around 70
percent in the Opacity field on the
Paintbrush Option bar.
Lowering the opacity reduces the
“strength” of your painting, result-
ing in a more realistic transition
between the masked and the
painted areas of the layer.
Figure 11-40: Applying a Gaussian Blur to
the bad ties.
Figure 11-41: Painting in the sharper
portions that are hidden under the Layer
Mask.

6. Paint in the areas of
the image you want to
sharpen. 
Yes, it’s a bit more
work, but here’s why it
works:
• Painting areas of
the image hides
the Gaussian Blur
and reveals the
sharper image
behind the
Gaussian Blur
mask, leaving the
unpainted areas
still blurred.
• Painting reveals
the sharper
details of the
chosen “bad” tie
but leaves a soft-
ened look for the
rest of the ties
(which is proba-
bly a good thing;
these were hang-
ing on a clearance
rack for a
reason!), as
shown in the
image’s final form
in Figure 11-42.
To selectively sharpen an image, use the same approach used to blur the
image: Create a layer and merge the previous layers. Sharpen the entire
image, and create a Layer Mask to hide the sharpening. Paint the areas you
want to sharpen, and that’s it!

ne of the biggest challenges a photographer faces is producing output.
It’s not that it’s difficult (or that we’re lazy), but we do spend a lot of
time shooting, messing around with images in Photoshop, and cruising
the Web for photo sites when we have some spare time. It just
seems many photographers don’t print enough of their work
to show off those stunning images!
Have you ever gone through and viewed images
you’ve taken a few years ago, and wonder why you
never processed them or printed them for your port-
folio? (See, I know you’ve done that before!) This
chapter shows you the process and techniques
needed to produce beautiful prints and images for
the Web. The ultimate destination for all our work is
the final image — and I have one more set of steps to
show you that will get you there: the output workflow.
Hopefully, you’ll realize that by incorporating this final
workflow into your overall process, for every image, you’ll
have many more photos to hang on your wall, do a show, or
post to your photo Web site.

Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
Using an Output Workflow
Turning those pretty on-screen pictures into scintillating Web images — or into
actual hard copy you can hold in your hands or hang on a wall — is another
whole kettle of fish. This section shows you how to put the fish in the kettle in
the right order, in an output workflow that looks like this: 
1. Organize your output photos.
When you edit images in Photoshop, keep those versions of your image
files in a folder named to indicate that you’ve edited those images. When
you prep your photos for output, set up folders to save separate ver-
sions of the images in folders for prints, Web, or press.
2. Make sure color management is implemented.
From making color settings (Edit➪Color Settings) to proofing (View➪
Proof Setup), two best practices will help you ensure effective color 
management:
• Edit your images in the correct color space.
• Proof your images while editing, using the correct output profile in
the Customize Proof Condition window shown in Figure 12-1.
Figure 12-1: The Customize Proof Condition window.

3. Properly resize your images.
Use the Crop tool or the Image Size command to resize your images to
match your output needs. Make sure you specify the correct output res-
olution, such as 72ppi for Web images or 300ppi for prints. Resize your
images using the Bicubic resampling method (for enlarging photos) or
the Bicubic Smoother resampling method (for reducing the size of
photos).
4. Sharpen your photos.
Almost all digital photos look better when you sharpen them in Photo-
shop. To sharpen photos, use the Unsharp Mask or the new Smart
Sharpen filters available in the Filter menu. For best results in most
photos, first increase the amount to a setting between 100 and 300, set
the Radius to around 1.3 or 1.4, and then slide the Threshold slider to
about 5 to 7 to reduce sharpening artifacts.
These settings are typical, but the Amount, Radius, and Threshold set-
tings might be different for your photos. 
5. Save the image in an output folder.
Don’t forget a little thing called image management (which I cover in
Chapter 4): Before printing, save your image using the File➪Save As
command; save the modified output file to a folder you’ve designated 
for your output files.
6. Print.
Printing isn’t like typing your resignation letter to your boss in Word
(after you won the lottery, right?) and then clicking the Print button. In
Photoshop, there are a number of printing options that have to be set up
correctly to ensure that your prints come out of the printer just the way
they look on your computer monitor. I don’t want to throw a curve ball
here, but there are two methods for printing. (Don’t worry, I show you
both of them later in this chapter.)
A Little Color-Management Reminder
Confusing as color management can be, when it comes to printing with accu-
rate colors, you need to be thoroughly familiar with spaces:
 Working space: This term refers to the color area Photoshop uses to
work with colors. Images are edited in Photoshop using the working
space color settings, and then converted to the printer space during
223
Chapter 12: Preparing Photos for Output

224
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
printing. Figure 12-2 shows the
Photoshop Color Settings
window, where your working
space is applied in Photoshop. 
 Printer space: This term refers
to the settings that tell Photo-
shop the printer, paper, and
level of quality you’re printing
to. To make great prints,
Photoshop needs to know the
printer and paper you’re using
so it can convert your photo’s
data correctly by using the
printer driver (loaded when 
you first set up your printer). 
All that happens when you use
the File➪Print With Preview
command.
For photographers, there are only two
working spaces to consider using:
Adobe RGB (1998) and ColorMatch
RGB. Deciding which color space to use in Photoshop depends on the type of
printer you have. In my case, ColorMatch RGB best matches the colors my
inkjet photo printers can produce. Choosing either working space produces
excellent results.
To set your Photoshop color space, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Color Settings.
The Color Settings window (refer to Figure 12-2) is where you set up
your working space for editing photos.
2. Choose U.S. Prepress Defaults in the Settings field.
This selection provides the best options for photographers.
3. Choose Adobe RGB (1998) or ColorMatch RGB in the Working Spaces
RGB field.
You get great results using either choice for photos. ColorMatch RGB
may provide more accurate color for use with some inkjet printers.
Experiment with using both Adobe RGB (1998) and ColorMatch RGB to
see what results are best for the printer you are using. 
Figure 12-2: Photoshop color settings.

4. Choose Preserve Embedded Profile in the Color Management Policies
RGB field.
When you open a file that has an embedded working space other than
that specified in the Working Spaces RGB field, Photoshop either con-
verts those files to the specified working space or preserves the embed-
ded profile.
I keep the default Preserve
Embedded Profiles. That way, I’ll
be notified of any mismatches
(see Figure 12-3) when I open
the file, and have the opportu-
nity to convert the file to my
working space at that time. By
leaving the Profile Mismatches
Ask When Opening option
selected, Photoshop prompts
me to either leave the image in
its embedded working space or
convert the image to the work-
ing space I’ve specified in the
Color Settings window.
5. Set Conversion Options. 
Make sure to choose Adobe (ACE) (Adobe Colorimetric Engine) in the
Engine field, and Relative Colorimetric in the Intent field. Adobe (ACE) is
the engine used to convert colors; Relative Colorimetric is the best
choice for rendering intent for photographers.
6. Select Use Black Point Compensation.
This is the default setting. Black point compensation ensures that your
black points are set in the shadow areas of your photos. Selecting Black
Point Compensation is best for photos. If you don’t have this checked,
your images will appear muddy.
7. Click OK to save.
Sizing Images
Sooner or later, as you work with your photos, you have to resize them. I
always save this step until after I’ve made my overall color corrections and
image edits. Depending on the type of output you have planned for your
photos, you have to determine two factors:
225
Chapter 12: Preparing Photos for Output
Figure 12-3: The Embedded Profile Mismatch
window.

226
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
 Image size: The image size includes the dimensions you specify for
width and height. Do you want an 8×10, a 5×7, or a 4×6 photo? If your
photo’s destined for the Web, you want something smaller. 4×6 may be
the biggest size you’ll want to display images at on the Web, and smaller
sizes are preferred.
 Print resolution for your photo: If you are preparing the image for print-
ing, set the resolution to 300 or 360 pixels per inch (ppi). If you are tar-
geting the file for the Web, you’ll want to set the resolution to 72ppi.
Anything more would be a waste of resolution (and of the time it takes
to transmit the file to the printer). Choose a resolution of 72ppi for your
Web images.
Resolution of sorts
Before resizing images, you want to understand pixels and resolution so you
can make the correct decisions in Photoshop when you resize your photos.
The first step is getting familiar with some basic terms:
 Pixels: Pixels are those little square dots illustrated in Figure 12-4 that
make up an image. Each pixel is uniform in size and contains one color. If
you’re shooting with, say, an 8-megapixel camera, each image captured
can contain 8 million pixels. That’s a potential. You always have the
option to capture images at smaller resolutions (say, at 3.2 megapixels
or lower). In any case, that’s a lot of pixels.
 Image resolution: This is the setting used to size an image for output.
For example, images to be viewed on-screen or on the Web should be 
set to a resolution of 72ppi (pixels per inch, sometimes referred to as
dots per inch or dpi). Images targeted for printing should be set to
around 300ppi.
Image resolution is relative. Different digital cameras produce different-
size images, but it’s the number of pixels per inch that actually deter-
mines resolution: More pixels per inch means better image quality when
you print large photos. My 7-megapixel compact digital camera (for
example) captures images at 300ppi where the image dimensions are
10.24 × 7.68 inches. My older 5-megapixel compact digital camera cap-
tures images at 72ppi — but the dimensions are 35.5 × 26.6 inches.
If you change the resolution of the image you get from a 5-megapixel
compact digital camera from 72ppi to 300ppi, the dimensions then
shrink to 8.5 × 6.4 inches. You really haven’t changed the actual size of
the image; you’ve just shrunk the image on-screen to achieve a desired
output resolution that matches your printer’s optimum printing condi-
tions. If you had a 35-inch-wide printer, you could change the ppi setting
back to 72 to achieve that image-output size, but the image quality at
that huge print size would be crummy.

Figure 12-4: Most digital camera’s produce square pixels.
 File size: For digital images, the best way to describe the size of a file is
by the number of pixels it contains. The 7-megapixel file my compact
digital camera produces is 3,072 × 2,304 pixels. Multiply those two pixel
dimensions together and you have 7,077,888 pixels — 7 megapixels.
 Image dimension: Image dimension is the actual physical size of an
image when it’s printed or sized for display. Image dimension should not
be confused with resolution or file size.
Understanding interpolation
Interpolation is the process of increasing the resolution of an image (or a sec-
tion of an image) when cropping to increase the number of pixels per inch. A
227
Chapter 12: Preparing Photos for Output

228
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
6-megapixel digital camera should be able to produce 8×10 prints without a
problem, even if you have to do some cropping.
If you print large prints — say, 11×14, or 13×19 — your digital camera can
produce more resolution without interpolation, and that’s a better result.
Larger prints require a larger amount of image information, however; 
for larger prints, the more megapixels, the better. Though you can get accept-
able large prints from 5-megapixel cameras (or even some photos shot with 
a 3- or 4-megapixel camera), you’re usually limited to prints no larger than
8×10 inches.
If you do a lot of cropping, and still maintain image sizes of 5×7 or 8×10, the
image quality may noticeably decrease at that print size — unless you tell
Photoshop to interpolate by indicating a higher resolution in the Crop tool’s
Option bar when you crop.
I’ll often crop out small portions of a photograph — it’s sort of like creating a
photo from a photo — but indicating a higher resolution in the Option bar may
degrade the quality somewhat, depending on how much of the image you’re
eliminating in your crop. Images from 7- or 8-megapixel cameras can still pro-
vide enough resolution to produce high-quality large prints even if you do
some extreme cropping — as I’ve done in the example shown in Figure 12-5.
Figure 12-5: Extreme cropping at the same ppi setting.
Original as 360ppi
Extreme crop at 360ppi

A great Photoshop plug-in to use to further interpolate images is Genuine
Fractals. You can enlarge an image up to 700 percent without image degrada-
tion, a perfect solution for extreme cropping or when you want to enlarge
your digital images to poster-size prints. For more information on Genuine
Fractals, visit its Web site at www.ononesoftware.com.
When you choose a resample method, Photoshop actually assigns an interpo-
lation method — which assigns color values to the new pixels that are cre-
ated when you enlarge an image. Photoshop bases those color values on a
sample of neighboring pixels (hence the term sampling). The resampling
method you choose helps preserve the quality of the image when you size an
image larger than its native (original) resolution.
Here’s your range of resampling choices:
 Nearest Neighbor: Used for basic illustrations when quality isn’t an
issue. Not recommended for photos.
 Bilinear: Another method not recommended for use with photos, but
still useful for some illustrations.
 Bicubic: The preferred method of resampling photos. This method uses
the values of surrounding pixels to interpolate. Leave Bicubic as your
default resampling method because it provides the highest quality inter-
polation method in Photoshop.
 Bicubic Smoother: This method (similar to the bicubic resampling
method) increases the size of an image — with smoother results than with
other resampling methods. May be good for some images and portraits.
 Bicubic Sharper: This resampling method is used for reducing the size of
an image while enhancing sharpness.
Note: Because sharpening is a step that should come after resizing, the
Bicubic Sharper option really isn’t needed.
Resizing using the Crop tool
One easy way to size your images is by using the Crop tool to specify the
exact width, height, and output resolution of an image. Figure 12-6 shows the
Crop tool used to crop and size an image.
To use the Crop tool, follow these steps:
1. Open an image.
2. Click the Crop tool in the Photoshop Toolbox.
229
Chapter 12: Preparing Photos for Output

230
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
3. Type the width in the Width field in the Option bar.
This measurement is how wide you want your output image to be when
it prints out or appears on the Web. Here I’ve chosen a width of 7 inches.
Figure 12-6: Cropping with the Crop tool.
4. Type the height in the Height field.
I’ve chosen a height of 5 inches.
5. Type the resolution you want for your file.
If you’re preparing an image for printing, enter 300ppi to 360ppi in the
Resolution field. If file is destined for the Web, enter 72ppi. I’ve chosen 
a resolution of 360ppi for the purpose of printing. To avoid getting the
dreaded jaggies, don’t increase the resolution greater than what the
image is already set to.

6. Click and drag the area in your image that you want to crop.
Release the mouse button. When you do, the crop area you selected
remains bright; the area you want to eliminate darkens. Additionally, you
can hold down the Spacebar while dragging the Crop tool, and the selec-
tion area moves without changing dimensions.
7. Resize or move the crop area to the position you like best.
Click the crop area and, while holding down the mouse button, move 
the highlighted crop area around until you position the crop where you
want it.
Click any of the corners of the crop box and drag the corner up or down
to resize the crop area. Click just outside any corner to rotate the crop
area.
8. Click the check mark icon in the Option bar to complete the crop.
Alternatively, you can just double-click inside the selected area to com-
plete the crop.
The image is sized exactly as selected at 5×7 at 360ppi.
Resize using Image Size
Instead of using the Crop tool to size images, you can use the Image Size com-
mand to change the size of images that don’t need cropping.
To change the size of an image using the Image Size command, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Image➪Image Size or
press Ctrl+Alt+I (Ô+Option+I
on the Mac).
Figure 12-7 shows the Image Size
window.
2. Deselect the Resample Image
option.
3. Type in the width of the image.
If you are printing an 8×10, type
8 in the Width field if the image
is in Portrait orientation or 10 
if the image is in Landscape 
orientation.
231
Chapter 12: Preparing Photos for Output
Figure 12-7: The Image Size window.

232
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
If you type the width first, then the height and resolution automatically
change to accommodate the new width. The Image Size adjustment auto-
matically changes the height and resolution as long as the Resample
Image check box is not selected.
4. Select the Resample Image option.
Selecting this option now locks the width and height so those dimen-
sions don’t change when you enter the resolution you want.
5. Type in the resolution for the photo.
Leave the default resampling method, Bicubic, which is the best setting
for photographs.
6. Click OK to close the window and save your changes.
Sharpen Up!
The final step in an output-preparation workflow is to sharpen your photos —
that is, enhance the edges and increase contrast. Almost all images produced
by digital cameras need some sharpening before you print them or save them
for use on the Web. But don’t start returning your digital cameras for refunds;
they do indeed take sharp pictures. But after you’ve adjusted, edited, and
resized your digital images, they’ll need to be sharpened enough to give them
back some crispness. Different photos need different amounts of sharpening
applied; there is no standard amount that works for all images.
Sharpening is the last step in running an image through Photoshop, so if you
need to get rid of visual noise, run your image through noise reduction before
you sharpen. Other tips for sharpening include these:
 Sharpening does not help photos that are out of focus or blurred.
Sharpening only benefits photos that were properly focused in the
camera when you shot them.
 Only sharpen images after an image has been sized for final output. If
you sharpen images before you resize, you’ll get undesirable sharpening
artifacts in your image, like the dreaded jaggies. 
 Create a separate layer for sharpening the image. If you resize the
image later, you can always delete the original sharpening layer. Create a
layer by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E (Ô+Shift+Option+E on a Mac). The
new target layer will be created with the visible layers merged together.
 Sharpen images using the Unsharp Mask or Smart Sharpen filters
located in the Filter➪Sharpen menu. The Smart Sharpen filter offers
enhanced sharpening capabilities not found in the Unsharp Mask filter —
including finer-tuned control over shadows and highlights.

By now you may wonder why Adobe gave the best sharpening tool for photos
a nonsensical name like Unsharp Mask. Tradition, I guess; Unsharp Mask is a
term left over from the old sharpening processes used in the darkroom. I’m
not sure why Adobe didn’t just change the name to Photo Sharpening, or to
USE THIS FILTER TO MAKE YOUR PHOTOS SHARP. For now, just remember
that Unsharp Mask is a good and easy-to-use tool for sharpening your images.
You can selectively sharpen specific portions of your image by using the
Layer Mask techniques I explain in Chapter 11.
Here’s how to sharpen a photo using the Unsharp Mask filter:
1. Open the image that you want to sharpen.
Figure 12-8 shows an image before sharpening.
Before you sharpen an image, make sure that you have already resized
the image for final output. Sharpening an image before resizing it
decreases its quality.
Figure 12-8: Original image before sharpening.

Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
2. Zoom in on the image to get a better look at what happens when you
sharpen.
3. Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask.
The Unsharp Mask filter window appears.
4. Click a part of the image that contains straight lines or contrast.
Doing so helps you judge the amount of sharpening to apply. It’s easier
to see the effects of using too much sharpening when you view zoomed
sections that include straight lines or noticeable contrast between areas.
5. Move the Amount slider to the
right, as shown in Figure 12-9.
How much to set depends on the
image. Increasing the amount
actually increases contrast along
edges, giving you the appearance
of a sharpening effect. For por-
traits, settings around 100 to 
150 may be sufficient; for land-
scapes, 200 to 300 may produce
the results you want.
6. Move the Radius slider to the
right.
The Radius is simply the amount
of edge pixels that are affected
by the Amount. Move the slider
to the range of 1.3 pixels to 1.5
pixels; boosting it beyond 1.5
can mean poor results. View 
the image in the Unsharp Mask
window and the Image window
to judge what you get.
You can also type the value you want into the Radius field instead of
using the slider. Sometimes it’s not worth the hassle trying to use the
slider for precise adjustments like the Radius setting. I just type in the
value of 1.4 or 1.5, and retype it in the field if I need to readjust.
7. Move the Threshold slider to the right until the zoomed preview shows
a reduction of sharpening artifacts.
Sharpening increases the unwanted artifacts that appear as noise in
your image. Moving the Threshold slider to the right (so the setting is
somewhere between 4 and 7) reduces those artifacts in your image after
you set the Amount and Radius; increasing the Threshold reduces some
sharpening. Judge the amount of Threshold you use; as with other things
in life, Sharpen and Threshold have a give-and-take relationship.

The Smart Sharpen filter
Photographers have always used the Unsharp
Mask for sharpening photos in Photoshop. New in
CS2 is the Smart Sharpen filter, which will change
the way we sharpen our photos. The Smart
Sharpen filter seems to be like the Unsharp Mask
filter on steroids, and not only that, it has a much
better name! 
Smart Sharpen offers the photographer more
sharpening control than what’s offered in the
Unsharp Mask filter by adding the capability of
controlling the amount of sharpening that’s applied
to both the shadow and highlight areas of an image. As a bonus, you can save the algorithms you’ve
set up for use with other images.

Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
Printing, the Final Stop
All the work you’ve done organizing,
converting, adjusting, editing, and
preparing images for output is
intended for one thing, the final print.
Wouldn’t it be nice if all you have to
do in this final step is to choose
File➪Print and click OK? Well, sure,
that would be nice, but . . . nope. You
still have a few more steps to take
before you send your image to the
printer (see Figure 12-11).
Your printer driver — the printer-
setup software you load on your
computer when you install a new printer — gives you many options for con-
trolling how it prints your photos. When you print from Photoshop, you’ll be
viewing these printer driver windows to customize the way you want to print.
Not only that, there are two methods for printing: You can let Photoshop
determine color conversions, or you can let your printer driver determine
color conversions. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. 
I review those in a little bit.
Choosing papers
If you are printing using a photo-quality printer, you have a slew of paper
choices. There is no right or wrong paper to use; follow your personal taste.
Personally, I lean toward papers that have a longer display life (also called
longer image permanence, though of course “permanence” is relative here).
When choosing papers, keep these ideas in mind:
 Choose photo-quality papers manufactured for your printer model.
There are a lot of papers on the market, but choosing papers that were
intended for your model of printer works best.
 If available, choose papers where individual profiles for that specific
paper type are available. For some printers and papers, you can install
files on your computer that tell your printer driver and Photoshop how
to handle colors. These files are called ICC or ICM files, also referred to
as paper profiles. Check your printer manufacturer’s Web site for the
latest printer drivers and paper profiles to load on your computer.
Figure 12-11: Printing away.

 Make sure the paper type is compatible with your printer. There are two
different types of inkjet printers: those that use dye-based inks, and those
that use pigment-based inks. For best results, make sure the paper you
choose is compatible with your printer and the type of ink it uses. Dye-
sublimation printers (printers that use thermal printing technology) work
only with papers made for those types of printers.
A popular method for printing is to send your image files over the Web to
companies such as Kodak or (for that matter) Costco. If you want to use
these printing services, make sure you can download printer profiles from
their Web sites. I recently went on vacation, and took about 300 snapshots
with my compact digital camera. Instead of waiting weeks to print them all on
my inkjet at a higher cost, I transmitted them to my local Costco — after I’d
downloaded the ICC paper profile from the Costco Web site for the paper I
wanted them to use, made my adjustments in Photoshop, and proofed those
photos with my Costco profiles. The extra work paid off; the 4×6 prints I
picked up were very accurate.
Letting Photoshop do the printing
I mentioned at the beginning of this section that there are two workflows you
can use for printing. Here’s the first (and preferred) choice: Letting
Photoshop handle color management. (The second choice is letting the
printer handle color management; more about that shortly.)
To set up Photoshop to handle the color management for your images during
the printing process, follow these steps:
1. Open the file you want to print.
If the Embedded Profile
Mismatch window (refer to
Figure 12-3) appears, select the
working space that you set up in
the Color Settings window.
2. Indicate the print orientation.
After you choose File➪Page
Setup, choose Portrait or
Landscape orientation to match
your image. Figure 12-12 shows
the Page Setup window.
3. Choose File➪Print with
Preview or press Ctrl+Alt+P
(Ô+Option+P on a Mac).
The Print window appears,
showing a preview of your
image.

18. Select Off (No Color Adjustment) in the ICC/ICM Profile section.
This turns off the printer’s color management and lets Photoshop con-
vert the colors.
Selecting the Off (No Color Adjustment) option is important. Doing so
prevents color management from being applied twice to the photo. If
that were to happen, it would make your photo too dark and too red.
19. Click OK to complete your work and send the image to the printer. 
Admire your printed photo!
If you selected the Print Preview
option in the Print Options area of
the Printer Driver window, the Print
Preview window (shown in Figure
12-17) is what you see next. The Print
Preview window gives you a quick
peek at the photo before you send it
to the printer. Click OK in the Printer
Driver window to send the image to
the printer.
Typically, prints need 24 hours to
dry after coming out of the printer.
Lay the prints on a flat surface and
let them dry overnight. If you have to, you can stack multiple prints with pho-
tographic tissue paper in between them.
Don’t count on the Print Preview to give you an accurate representation of how
your print will look coming out on the printer. Color, tone, brightness, and con-
trast may not appear correctly in the preview. Use Print Preview as a “sanity
check” to make sure you selected the right orientation, size, and so on.
Letting your printer do the printing
If letting Photoshop handle the color management doesn’t work out for you,
you can choose a second workflow — letting your printer handle the color
duties.
As mentioned in the previous section, letting Photoshop handle the printing
is the preferred method. Let the printer manage color only if your printer’s
paper profiles or driver produce unacceptable results when you try to print
from Photoshop.
Figure 12-17: The Print Preview window.

This method is also best used to print when printer profiles aren’t available,
or when you don’t know what type of paper you’re using. You may also get
good results from this method if the paper profiles provided for your printer
don’t print with accurate color when you’re printing from within Photoshop.
That problem usually stems from an inaccuracy in your printer driver, paper
profile (ICC profile), or color-management settings.
To set up your image for printing while letting the printer handle color man-
agement, follow these steps:
1. Open the file you want to print.
If the Embedded Profile Mismatch window (refer to Figure 12-3) appears,
select the working space that you set up in the Color Settings window.
2. Indicate the print orientation.
Choose File➪Page Setup and select Portrait or Landscape orientation,
depending on your image.
3. Choose File➪Print with Preview or press Ctrl+Alt+P (Ô+Option+P on
a Mac).
The Print window appears, showing a preview of your image.
4. Click Show More Options to
view all the settings shown in
Figure 12-18.
5. Choose Color Management
from the drop-down list below
the print preview.
6. Select the Document option in
the Print area to indicate the
image’s color space.
The color space should be 
listed as Adobe RGB (1998) or
ColorMatch RGB, depending on
what you chose in the Color
Settings window.
7. Choose Let Printer Determine
Colors in the Options Color
Handling field.
With this choice, you are telling
Photoshop to let the printer
convert the image color information to what works for the printer, not
Photoshop.

Understanding Image Permanence
Remember all those photos taken when you were a kid? I bet a lot of them 
are turning orange and fading — even if you’re in your twenties. Color pho-
tographs typically don’t last all that long — depending how they’re stored,
you’ve got maybe five or ten years before they begin to fade. That doesn’t
seem long for photos intended to be treasured for many years. They looked
like they’d last forever when you took them, but . . .
Image permanence is actually the lifespan of a photographic print before it
starts to deteriorate. After that, photos start to lose their color definition:
They begin to fade and change colors.
The question for you is how important image permanence is in your digital-
photography work. If a print fades after 10 years, you can just print another
one! (I have to admit, that argument does have merit, but I can’t help thinking
that if I’m busy printing today, the last thing I’ll want to do is print my photos
all over again in a few years. Life is short — for everything, it seems.)
When it comes to longer-lasting prints, inkjet printers have come a long way
in the past 10 years or so. The first photo-quality inkjet printers produced
prints with an image permanence rated at about 30 or 40 years, if you used
the right paper. That length of time is pretty good, often surpassing the per-
manence of prints received from the corner drugstore.
As a digital artist, I want my prints to last 100 to 200 years without any notice-
able deterioration. Fine art prints should last as long as technically possible.

A few recent desktop inkjet printers offer papers and inks that have an image-
permanence rating of 100 to 200 years, depending on the paper you use.
To make prints that last for the next several lifetimes, keep these guidelines
in mind:
 Choose a printer that produces good photo-quality images and offers
paper and ink options rated to last at least 100 years. Do your home-
work by researching printer models from the top photo printer manufac-
turers. Photo-quality printers should be able to produce photos at least
at 1440dpi (dpi ratings are applied by the manufacturer). Some printer
models can produce images at 2880dpi. I suggest visiting http://
epson.com, http://hp.com and http://canon.com for information 
on their latest models of photo-quality printers. All provide excellent
choices. For further information, check out the printing forum at
http://dpreview.com.
 Only use ink cartridges and paper intended for your particular brand
of printer. Be very careful about using third-party inks in your printers.
The printer wasn’t designed with third-party inks in mind. Manufacturers,
by the way, make their money off selling supplies, not hardware. They
have a monopoly on the supply market for their printers, but I still rec-
ommend sticking with your manufacturer’s brand of inks.
 Use papers manufactured for your printer model. Your printer wasn’t
engineered to work with most third-party papers. Image permanence rat-
ings are sometimes non-existent for these papers. You’ll get best results
using the printer manufacturer’s brand.
 Adhere to the manufacturer’s suggested storage and display standards
for your photographs. Typically, photographic paper/ink combinations
are rated with the assumption in mind that the photographs are stored
in archival conditions.
Archival is a term used mostly by museum curators, librarians, and classic
book dealers to mean long-lasting and harmless to what you’re storing. In the
photographic area, archival means specific handling of photographs and
media using papers, mounting boards, gloves, and special glass that encour-
age preservation. A whole industry is out there for archival supplies.
To preserve the life and quality of your prints, consider using the following
for storing and displaying your prints:
 Archival matte and backing boards: Whether you cut your own mattes
or have a professional framer do the work, make sure you’re using 100-
percent acid-free materials. Adhesives, tapes, and photo corners also
need to be acid-free.
247
Chapter 12: Preparing Photos for Output

248
Part IV: Photoshop CS2 Image-Processing Workflows 
 Archival photo storage boxes: Store unframed and photos in archival
boxes. Any light and air pollutants such as dust or pollen can quickly
degrade the permanence of photos. Make sure you store your prints in
boxes specifically sold as archival quality.
 Display mounted photographs in frames and behind UV-protected
glass (or Plexiglas): UV-protected glass filters out harmful ultraviolet
light, which can degrade the color of an image over time.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
f the earth hadn’t been created in seven days, it
could easily have taken ten.  Maybe that’s why
there are exactly 10 working days in a one-month
period (for me, anyway!), it takes 10 steps to get
from my desk to the refrigerator, and it’s about
a 10-mile round-trip from my house to the zoo,
where they have accommodations for 10 mon-
keys. (I like monkeys.) I have about 10 dollars in
my wallet. I can eat 10 Hostess cupcakes in one
sitting. I must have included 10 photos of squirrels
in this book because there must be 10 nests of the
darn things around my house. Do you see a pat-
tern here? Ten! Yes, the number 10, ﬁve plus ﬁve,
eleven minus one — the theme of this part!
The Part of Tens is my personal favorite part of
writing these books. I can get a little more creative
with these chapters, and assemble them as sets
of 10-cool-things-about-Photoshop. In Chapter 13,
I show you 10 ways to improve and share your
photographs, such as converting color images to
black and white, creating photo Web sites directly
from Photoshop, and stitching together panoramas.
Very cool stuff, and easy to do!
I also show how to add special effects that turn
ordinary photos (maybe some you wouldn’t bother
using) into works of art. I even impress myself
sometimes when messing around with a “blah”
image (or an artistic photo) produces something
beautiful — or downright weird. But the main
point is to open your mind to the possibilities,
be creative, and (most of all) have fun with your
images. I sure do!

Ten Ways to Improve Your 
Photos and Show Off 
Your Work 
A
s a “traditional” photographer, I put a lot of work over the years into
using proper shooting techniques — and into producing prints using
the regular chemical methods. Straight shots, straight prints. Since making
the transition to digital, I’ve incorporated more and more effects into my
work, as well as displaying photos in new media such as the Web. 
Photoshop offers photographers almost endless possibilities to improve
photos — and to process them creatively. To add further zest and originality
to your work, you can get third-party add-ons (also called plug-ins) that
give you even more ways to jazz up your work. Hey, if living life to
its fullest means an anything-goes attitude, adapt that strat-
egy to your photography. You’ll produce photos you’ve
never dreamed of. 
I still do a lot of traditional photography, but when-
ever I get a chance, I push Photoshop to its limits to
see what I can do. In this chapter, I show you some
tricks I use to enhance my photos.
Creating Black and White 
from Color
For traditional fine art photo collectors, purists, so-called “fine
art photographers,” and the artsy-fartsy crowd in general, the only
photographic “art form” is supposed to be the old silver-halide-produced

252
Part V: The Part of Tens 
black-and-white (B&W) photographs. Personally, I’ve never believed that for a
second. I like color — and I’m of the opinion that art is what you make of it.
Whatever happened to personal taste? The most important question to ask
yourself is, why limit yourself to either black and white or color? Do both! Hey,
its like I always say — “whatever blows your hair back!”
As with a lot of the cool things you can do in Photoshop, converting a color
digital image to a B&W image can be done in a number of ways. I show you 
a few that I use. The first is a “quickie” method. The second technique uses
the Channel Mixer. The third method (my favorite) uses the Hue/Saturation
adjustment layer to convert color photos to black and white. One method
isn’t really better than the other; I suggest you try all to see which you like
best. 
Quickie B&W from color
Sometimes less is more; I find that quick methods sometimes work best. For
instance, here’s a quickie method that takes the complexity out of B&W con-
versions, using one simple command to convert your color image to black
and white. Here are the steps to that quick conversion:
1. Open a photo in Photoshop that you want to convert to black and
white.
Make sure you’ve made your tonal and color corrections before pro-
ceeding. Though you’re converting your image to black and white, 
you still may want a color version as well. I cover those corrections in
Chapter 10.
2. Create a new layer to use to make your B&W conversion:
a. Create a new layer by pressing Shift+Ctrl+Alt+E (Shift+Ô+Option+E
on a Mac).
b. Name this new layer selections.
3. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Desaturate, or press Shift+Ctrl+U
(Shift+Ô+U on a Mac).
This procedure to convert your image to B&W is about as easy as they
come. The Desaturate command simply converts the entire image to
black and white.

Using the Channel Mixer to convert to B&W
Using the Channel Mixer, you can desaturate (that is, remove color) your
entire image, and then fine-tune the Red, Green, and Blue channels to obtain
more control over the tones of the image you are converting. It bears repeat-
ing: Photoshop always gives you many ways to obtain similar results — and
using the Channel Mixer is another way to convert color images to B&W
(while obtaining a slightly different result). To use the Channel Mixer to make
your conversion, follow these steps:
1. Open a photo in Photoshop that you want to convert to B&W.
Figure 13-1 shows a shot I’ve chosen to convert. The photo has some
color, but I thought it would look more interesting in black and white. 
Process the photo as you would any other, making the color and tonal
adjustments I cover in Chapter 10.
Figure 13-1: The original color photo.
2. Create a Channel Mixer adjustment layer.
From the Layers palette, click the Create New Fill button (or the
Adjustment Layer button) and choose Channel Mixer. You can use the
Channel Mixer to convert your image quickly from color to B&W, and
then make minor adjustments.
253
Chapter 13: Ten Ways to Improve Your Photos and Show Off Your Work

254
Part V: The Part of Tens 
3. Click the Monochrome 
check box.
Clicking the Monochrome check
box immediately converts your
image to black and white. Figure
13-2 shows the Monochrome
check box.
4. Make moderate adjustments to
the Red, Green, and Blue
channels in the Channel Mixer
dialog box.
You don’t need to move the
Red, Green, or Blue sliders
much. Most of the time, you’ll
want to adjust the Red channel
slightly to get the B&W effect
you want.
Experiment by moving each slider — Red, Green, and Blue — and you’ll prob-
ably find that only slight (or even no) adjustment does the trick. Figure 13-3
shows the image converted using the Channel Mixer.
Figure 13-3: Converted image to B&W using the Channel Mixer.
Figure 13-2: Creating a Channel Mixer
adjustment layer.

To increase or decrease contrast in the image after you convert it to black
and white, create a Curves adjustment layer that you can use to increase or
decrease the contrast in your image to your liking.
Desaturating color using Hue/Saturation
Another way to convert color images to B&W involves Hue/Saturation adjust-
ment. I like to use this method to desaturate yellows, greens, blues, cyans,
and magentas in a color image. Then I use the Red Saturation control to 
add a little selenium-toned (you know those black-and-white photos with that
brownish toning to them) look to my B&W converted photo. Here’s the drill:
1. Open a photo you want to convert to B&W.
As in the first method, make sure you’ve made your tonal and color cor-
rections before proceeding. (I cover those corrections in Chapter 10.)
2. Create a Hue/Saturation adjust-
ment layer.
Figure 13-4 shows creating a
Hue/Saturation adjustment layer
by clicking the Create a New Fill
or Adjustment Layer button and
then choosing Hue/Saturation
from the resulting menu.
3. Desaturate colors, starting with
yellow:
a. Click the Edit menu, and
select Yellows (Ctrl+2
[Windows] or Ô+2 [Mac]).
b. In the Saturation control,
move the Saturation slider
all the way to the left to a
setting of –100 to remove
the yellow color. 
c. Repeat this step for each
of the other colors: greens, cyans, blues, and magentas. (You
adjust the reds in the next step.)
4. Desaturate the Red channel.
Move the slider all the way to the left to a setting of –100. Move the
slider back to the left slightly until you obtain a toned effect. A setting of
–70 to –40 usually gives me the toned effect I like in some of my B&W
conversions. The photo, when converted to B&W as shown in Figure 13-5,
is slightly toned with a Red-channel Saturation setting of –40.

Figure 13-5: Converted image using the Hue/Saturation adjustment to add tone.
Selective Color
You may have seen photos and film of B&W scenes where only a portion of
the frame is in color. In Photoshop, that’s a fairly easy effect to accomplish.
I’ve added a few of these photos to my portfolio, and it adds a nice surprise
for someone viewing my work on the Web or in a collection of prints.
My technique is simple — it’s almost the same as the previous technique that
converts color to B&W, except I save a selection in which color will remain.
The process that achieves this selective color follows:
1. Open a photo you want to convert to B&W while retaining an object
with color.
As in the first method, make sure you’ve made your tonal and color cor-
rections (see Chapter 10) before proceeding.
2. Create a new layer you can use to make selections:
a. Create a new layer by pressing Shift+Ctrl+Alt+E (Shift+Ô+Option+E
on a Mac).
b. Name this new layer selections.
3. Select a part of the image to remain in color.
Using the selection techniques covered in Chapter 11, select an area of
the image where you want color to remain. Figure 13-6 shows a zoomed
portion of my image with an area selected; here I’m using the Magic
Wand tool to select areas I want to retain their colors.
Color image
Converted to B&W using Hue/Saturation

Figure 13-6: Making selections using the Magic Wand tool.
As you use the Magic Wand, experiment with different Tolerance set-
tings. (You can find the Tolerance setting in the Option bar shown in
Figure 13-6.) For like colors, I’d use a lower setting (such as 20), but for
colors like those of the leaves in my example, I have to select a broader
range of colors — so here I change the Tolerance setting to 40. This
higher setting allows me to select more of the image with each click of
the Magic Wand.
4. Duplicate the layer.
Right-click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) on the active layer and choose
Duplicate layer. Name the new layer Convert to B&W.
5. Inverse the selection.
Because I want to keep the color in the selected leaves, I choose Select➪
Inverse, or Shift+Ctrl+I (Shift+Ô+I on a Mac), which inverses the selection
so the rest of the image (and not the leaves) gets converted to B&W.
6. Desaturate color.
Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Hue/Saturation, or press Ctrl+U (Ô+U on a
Mac). As in the B&W conversion technique covered in the “Desaturating
color using Hue/Saturation” section (earlier in this chapter), you desatu-
rate reds, greens, and blues by clicking the yellows, greens, blues, cyans,
and magentas, and moving the Saturation slider for each color all the
way to the left to desaturate it. 
Slide those reds only as far to the left as it takes to give you the slightly
toned effect. If you don’t want a toned effect in your image, you can slide
the reds all the way to the left to a setting of –100.

7. Adjust contrast by using the Curves adjustment.
I often find that my B&W conversions need a touch of contrast added.
Use the Curves adjustment to add or reduce contrast in the B&W areas
of the image to your personal taste.
Figure 13-7 shows the original color image, compared to the same image
converted to B&W with selective colors remaining.
Figure 13-7: Original color image and the converted image with selective color.
Creating a Cool Blurring Effect
Often I’ll shoot a series of photos of a subject, and use the best one as my
final working image. Other photos in the series may be good, but I’ve already
picked the best one. When I’m bored, and there’s nothing on TV like football,
The Three Stooges, any show with monkeys in it, or The Simpsons, I’ll fire up
the computer, start Bridge, and cruise for photos to have fun with.
Converted to B&W with selective color
Color image

One technique I like to use on these “lost treasures” is a selective blur effect.
I’ll apply a blur to the image, create a layer mask, then selectively paint in the
parts of the image I want blurred. 
Here’s the procedure that creates the blurring effect:
1. Open a photo you want to 
convert and apply the blur
effects to.
Make sure you’ve made your
tonal and color corrections 
(discussed in Chapter 10) before
proceeding.
2. Create a new layer to use to
apply the blur by pressing
Shift+Ctrl+Alt+E (Shift+Ô+
Option+E on a Mac) and then
name the layer gaussian blur,
as in the Layers palette shown
in Figure 13-8.
3. Choose the Gaussian Blur filter
by choosing Filter➪Blur➪
Gaussian Blur.
The Gaussian Blur filter window
appears, as shown in Figure
13-9. This is the filter you use to
apply the blur to the entire
image. Don’t worry — the next few steps show you how to bring back
the sharp parts of the image you want to retain.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
4. Blur the image.
Move the Radius slider to the left until the image and the preview dis-
plays the amount of blur you want. For this example, I’m settling for a
Radius value of 21.5.
5. Create a Layer Mask.
Create a Layer Mask by clicking the Create Layer Mask button located at
the bottom of the Layer palette (shown in Figure 13-8). 
You can also create a Layer Mask by choosing Layer➪Layer Mask➪
Reveal All (or Hide All). The Reveal All option will create the mask,
revealing the blur you applied in Step 4; the Hide All selection will hide
the blur effect you’ve added.
6. Paint in the blur (see Figure 13-10).
In this step, click the Paintbrush tool in the Toolbox to paint in the effect
of revealing the sharp areas of your image that you’ve decided to reveal.
The rest of the image will remain blurred.
Figure 13-10: Painting the sharp areas back into the image.
If your Paintbrush tool isn’t revealing any sharp areas, click the Switch
Foreground and Background Colors button on the Toolbox, or type X.
Doing so changes the foreground color to black in this case, revealing
the blurred areas of the image.
Figure 13-11 shows the original image, next to the image with selective
blurring applied.

Creating Abstracts with
Extreme Cropping
In the course of writing books on dig-
ital photography and discussing
techniques (some of which are
pretty abstract themselves) with
other photographers, I’ve come to
the conclusion that none of us can
come up with a good definition for
what a photographic abstract is. To
me, an abstract is a representation of
an object — possibly distorted —
that doesn’t represent what exactly
an object actually is. (Ack. See what I
mean?) It’s a visual description that
doesn’t make sense. Fortunately,
that’s the point: Abstracts aren’t 
supposed to make sense! 
I often like to shoot subjects that
don’t quite look like anything you’ll
normally see in the everyday world.
If you view a photo and can’t quite
tell what you’re looking at (as in
Figure 13-12), then I guess that’s an abstract. (Okay, it’s holiday lights shot at
night with a slow shutter speed while moving the camera. That’s how it was
done, but what is it? Good question. Take an aspirin.)
One technique I like to use involves some extreme cropping of macro (extreme
close-up) shots. If you haven’t noticed by now, I shoot photos of flowers
Original image
Selective blurring
261
Chapter 13: Ten Ways to Improve Your Photos and Show Off Your Work
Figure 13-12: Abstract of lights.

262
Part V: The Part of Tens 
whenever I can. Often I take macro shots of flowers, crop small areas of the
flower in Photoshop, and zoom in even more, till you can’t tell what you’re
looking at. Because the original was a macro shot, there’s detail that the
human eye can’t see without aid. The final images you can get with this tech-
nique can be fun, unusual, and often provide interesting subject matter for
(yes) artsy conversations.
Using this technique involves cropping. Cropping even small areas of an
image means you’re throwing away a lot of pixels. If the photo you want to
crop was shot with a 5-megapixel compact digital camera, you may wind up
with an image that doesn’t have enough resolution for large prints. You can
try interpolating the image (using the Image➪Image Size command), but
interpolation will get you only so far. For this technique, make sure (if possi-
ble) that you start out with images shot at the highest resolution your digital
camera will offer.
My technique is pretty simple:
1. Choose a close-up photo.
Many digital cameras have 
a macro mode that gets you
within an inch of your subject
(or closer), filling the frame
with an extreme close-up like
the photo in Figure 13-13.
2. Make overall color and tonal
corrections to the image.
Make sure you’ve finished
adjusting white balance, shad-
ows, exposure, levels, curves,
and hue/saturation before crop-
ping your image. (For more
about these adjustments, see
Chapters 10 and 11.)
3. Crop a portion of the image as
you desire.
Using the Crop tool, crop the
portion of the image you want,
as in the example shown in
Figure 13-14. Be sure to specify
width, height, resolution, and
dimension settings on the
Option bar.
Figure 13-15 shows the final
abstract image.

Stitching Panoramas
As a photographer who shoots landscapes often, I’ve grown quite fond of 
the Photoshop Photomerge feature: You use it to stitch together some chosen
images that were shot in a panoramic sequence to create (well, yeah) a
panorama. I’ve used it often, and can’t resist showing off great results like the
panoramic of the London riverfront in Figure 13-16.

mas without first mentioning how to shoot them! For best results, take 3 or 4
photos of a scene, all with the same exposure and white-balance setting. All
you need is a really cool panoramic scene to shoot, and a couple of basic
techniques.
Speaking of basics, here are some tips for shooting panoramic scenes: 
 Select a scene that’s either wide or tall. Hey, nobody ever said panoramic
images had to be horizontal! You can also shoot tall scenes from top to
bottom to stitch together later. (Too bad nobody builds giant moon rock-
ets anymore.)
 Mount your digital camera to a sturdy tripod. I always recommend
shooting as many of your photos on a tripod as humanly possible. A
tripod helps you achieve the sharpest possible photos, especially when
you’re shooting in low-light conditions and your shutter speed is less
than 1⁄125 of a second. Look through your viewfinder or LCD and pan the
scene from left to right (or top to bottom) to make sure your camera is
level. If you see that your panning is a little off, adjust your tripod head
to level your camera as best as you can.
 Meter the main part of the scene. I recommend using manual shutter-
speed, aperture, and white-balance settings. Look at your LCD or view-
finder to see how your digital camera is metering the scene. Switch to
manual mode, and then set your shutter speed and aperture to match
your digital camera’s first meter reading of the scene. The idea is to
ensure that the exposure is the same for every photo sequence you
shoot. Additionally, set your white balance manually to match the 
conditions you’re shooting in, such as daylight, overcast, or shade. 
 Take a series of photos. If you’re shooting a horizontally oriented scene,
start on the left, and take the first shot. Pan your camera to the right
until you’ve overlapped the previous shot by 1⁄3. Take the second shot.
Pan to the right again until you’ve overlapped the previous shot by 1⁄3,
and take the photo. If your panorama requires a fourth frame, repeat the
process, overlapping the previous frame by 1⁄3.
 Review your photos. Using your digital camera’s LCD, review your
photos to make sure you achieved the results you intended. Check to
make sure your images are sharp and properly metered. If you need to,
take another series of panoramic shots using different zoom settings on
your lens. Keep shooting different aspects of the scene to make sure that
you captured the panoramic frames you know will make a great continu-
ous scene. Figure 13-17 shows three separate frames I shot to use for my
panorama, overlapping each by 1⁄3 of a frame.

Figure 13-17: Three photos taken in overlapping sequence.
Using Photomerge
Now that you have a number of images taken in sequence that you can use 
to stitch together into a panorama, it’s time to use Bridge and Photomerge.
Photomerge is a Photoshop utility that’s accessible from both Bridge and the
Photoshop File➪Automate menu. I find it easiest to use Bridge to choose my
images first:
1. Open Bridge and select the folder to choose your images from. 
2. Process the images using Camera Raw.
Assuming that the images you want for your panorama are still in raw
format, you’ll need to process each of the 3 or 4 images you’ll be using. 
To ensure all of the images you’ll be using for your panorama share the
same Camera Raw adjustments:
265
Chapter 13: Ten Ways to Improve Your Photos and Show Off Your Work

266
Part V: The Part of Tens 
a. Process the first image in the sequence in Camera Raw.
Make necessary raw adjustments to White Balance, Exposure,
Shadows, Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, and Curves.
b. Copy raw settings.
You’ll want to apply the settings made to the first image to the
remaining 2 or 3 images in your sequence. This will ensure that
adjustments are the same for each image in your panorama, which
is important because you want all the images to have the same
color and tone throughout.
To copy raw settings, right-click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) on the image
thumbnail in bridge, and choose Copy Camera Raw Settings as
shown in Figure 13-18.
Figure 13-18: Copy Camera Raw Settings.
c. Paste raw settings to the remaining images.
Select the remaining images in your sequence into which you want
to paste the Camera Raw settings: Click their thumbnails while
holding down the Alt key (Option key on a Mac); then right-click
(Ctrl+click on a Mac) and choose Paste Camera Raw Settings from
the flyout menu.
3. Select images in Bridge to Photomerge.
Select each photo intended for your panorama in Bridge by holding the
Alt key (Option key on the Mac) while clicking each image.

4. Choose Tools➪Photoshop➪Photomerge (see Figure 13-19).
Figure 13-19: Choosing Photomerge from the Tools menu.
Photomerge attempts to assemble the images as one. For some panora-
mas, Photomerge can’t quite figure out the entire panorama on its own,
so you’ll have to drag the images into the Photomerge window yourself
(and line them up in the proper position there) to complete your
panorama.
Figure 13-20 shows the Photomerge window with the panoramic image
stitched together.

5. Click the Advanced Blending check box.
After checking the Advanced Blending check box, click the Preview
button. Advanced blending gives you a better preview of how well
Photomerge combined your images. You may have to use the Select
Image tool to move individual images around so they overlap properly.
Use the Zoom tool to magnify the different overlapping areas of your
image so you can check the overlap for each part of the panorama.
6. Click OK to load the panorama into Photoshop.
7. Crop the image.
When you get the image into Photoshop, crop the image to ensure the
borders of the image don’t contain any white space. Figure 13-21 shows
the final cropped image.
Figure 13-21: Final panorama.
8. Complete final color, tonal corrections, and edits.
As with any image, go through your overall corrections and editing
workflows to finish the image and get it ready for output. Start by using
the Levels, Curves, and the Hue/Saturation adjustment levels to fine-
tune color and tone. Make any needed edits such as dodging and burn-
ing, covered in Chapter 11.
Creating a Thin Black Line
A nice touch I like to add — especially to photos printed in magazines and
books or displayed on the Web — is a thin black line around the image. It’s an
efficient way to separate the image from the rest of the page and add a classy
look. To create a thin black line, follow these steps:
1. Open a photo that’s been corrected and edited.
2. Create a new layer.

The Stroke command will not
start using the background layer
unless you make a selection by
choosing Select➪All, but I would
rather perform this step in a
separate layer; duplicate the
background layer (by choosing
Layer➪Duplicate Layer) to give
the command something to
work on.
3. Choose Edit➪Stroke (see
Figure 13-22).
Enter a width of 3 or 4 pixels.
Choose black in the Color field,
and then click Inside as your
setting for Location.
4. Click OK.
The image shows a 3-pixel-wide black border like the one in Figure 13-23.

Creating a Photo Web Site
Sure, I’ve used a lot of tools such as FrontPage to create my own photo Web
site (shown in Figure 13-24). But I’ve also used the Photoshop Web Photo

Gallery to create photo Web sites to display images to clients — and I’m
amazed how good a job the Web Photo Gallery does. It’s a built-in Web-site
generator within Photoshop — and a quick way to show off your photos on
the Web or create custom sites for clients.
Figure 13-24: The author’s Web site.
Web Photo Gallery is part of Photoshop, but it’s also accessible through
Bridge, where its easier to browse for images you want to include in your
Web site. Here’s how to create a Web site using Web Photo Gallery:
1. Select images in Bridge to include in your Web site.
If you followed the image-management workflow described in Chapter 4,
you have a group of images in an Output folder, awaiting their shot at
the Web. As a best practice, process your images in Photoshop, and
then convert each image in a format that’s Web-friendly. Images shown
on the Web should be processed in the RGB working space and saved in
the JPEG format at 72dpi. Figure 13-25, for example, shows images in an
output folder I created for Web images selected in Bridge.

Figure 13-25: Selecting images in Bridge for your Web site. 
2. Start Web Photo Gallery.
Choose Tools➪Photoshop➪Web Photo Gallery.
3. Browse styles by clicking the
Styles selection box (shown in
Figure 13-26).
Web Photo Gallery offers a vari-
ety of templates you can use for
your photo Web site. When you
browse the styles by selecting
them one at a time, you can
view the style in the preview
area located on the right side of
the Web Photo Gallery window.
4. Select source images and 
destination.
In the Source Images section of
the Web Photo Gallery window,
make sure Selected Images from
Bridge is chosen in the Use

Uploading your site to a Web provider makes it available to the world. Free
Web providers are readily available on the Internet, or your Internet service
provider may already offer Web hosting. Many Internet providers such as
Comcast offer subscribers free Web space. If you want to get fancier and set
up a Web site with your own URL, try services such as Yahoo Small Business or
Geocities; both offer low-cost solutions. However you go about it, no excuses —

Creating a Fine Art Poster
Do you ever walk into someone’s office, place of business, or home and see
those beautiful photographic posters framed and hanging on the wall? Do you
see the works of Ansel Adams or other famous photographers, in the form of
fine art posters, and ask yourself, Why can’t I do that? Well, you can — using
Photoshop!
1. Choose a photo that you’d be
proud to hang in a large poster
frame.
Make sure that the image has
enough resolution to print
clearly at a size of about 
11×14 inches. If you shoot
with a 6-megapixel digital SLR
(or an 8-megapixel compact digi-
tal camera), you may have the
resolution in your photo needed
to achieve good detail at that
size — about 300 pixels/inch.
I’ve chosen the photo in
Figure 13-28 for the poster.
2. Add a thin black line around
the image.
Create a new layer and choose
Edit➪Stroke. Add a 3-pixel 
black line on the inside of the
image.
3. Choose Select➪All.
Selecting the entire image will
let you copy it easily to the
new poster canvas you create
in Step 4.
4. Create a new document in
Photoshop.
Choose File➪New. In the New
Document window shown in
Figure 13-29, make these settings:

274
Part V: The Part of Tens 
a. Set the Width to 20 Inches.
b. Set the Height to 24 Inches.
c. Set the Resolution to the same resolution as your chosen photograph.
A value of 300 pixels/inch should be sufficient for most printers.
5. Make the chosen Photo window active by clicking the photo.
6. Choose Edit➪Copy to copy the photo into memory.
7. Make the new document active by clicking the new document window.
This will make the 20×24-inch poster active. Choose Edit➪Paste to paste
your photo into the new document.
8. Click the Move tool and drag
the photo to where you want to
place it in the poster.
Figure 13-30 shows how I placed
the photo in the poster so I have
more space on the bottom.
That’s so I can fit my text into
that spot.
9. Using the Type tool, add text to
your poster.
Choose your favorite font, click
the area of the poster where you
want your text to appear, and
then type in your text. Make sure
the font is large enough to read
well and look good on the poster.
Figure 13-31 shows the finished
poster.
Most of us don’t have large-format
printers in our offices or homes that can print high-quality 20×24-inch
posters; send that job out to a printing service bureau. Be sure to use a rep-
utable service that can offer ICC profiles you can proof your colors against
while you’re tweaking your poster in Photoshop; otherwise, you won’t be sat-
isfied with the results. Look for a local photo lab that has experience in print-
ing digital files at large-format sizes.

Creating Slideshows
Want to share your photos with loved ones, friends, or clients? It’s easy:
Create a PDF slideshow. The PDF Presentation utility is available in both
Bridge and Photoshop, but I prefer to choose my images in Bridge first, and
start PDF Presentation from there. To create a PDF Presentation, follow these
steps:
1. Choose the photos for your slideshow using Bridge (see Figure 13-32).

Figure 13-32: Choosing images in Bridge.
Your photos will be viewed on a
computer monitor, so all you
need here is a resolution of
72ppi; anything more would
be a waste. If you have created
Web images for all the photos
you’ve processed, use those.
(They are stored in your Web
output folder, right? If not, you
may want to review the image-
management workflow in
Chapter 4.)
2. Choose Tools➪Photoshop➪

The PDF Presentation window
appears, as shown in Figure
13-33. The chosen images are
listed in the Source Files area. 
Figure 13-33: PDF Presentation window.

3. Select the Presentation radio
button in the Output Options

You can also choose options that
set how many seconds you want
your slides to appear before
moving on to the next slide,
and what kind of transition you
want to make from one slide to
another. There are some really
cool transitions to choose from!
4. Save the presentation.
In the Save window shown in
Figure 13-34, choose a place to
save the PDF Presentation on
your computer. Choose an exist-
ing folder (or create a new
folder), click the Open button,
and then click the Save button.
5. Choose settings in the Save
Adobe PDF window.
The Save Adobe PDF window
appears. Click the Adobe PDF
Preset selection box and
choose Smallest File Size
(shown in Figure 13-35) if the
presentation is to be viewed on
a computer. You may want to
choose larger sizes if your pre-
sentation is to be printed out at
high quality.
6. Click the Save PDF button. 
Your new PDF Presentation
is ready for viewing in the
Adobe PDF window, as shown
in Figure 13-36.
Your presentation should start auto-
matically after you’ve saved it to the
designated location. You can always

Mount and Frame Your Photos
The last and most important section of this chapter deals with the final 
showing of your photos. As a photographer, I love to show off my photos,
but (as a rule) only in their final form. The Web is a great place to show off
your images, but nothing beats viewing a photograph that’s mounted,
framed, and displayed at eye level, hanging on the wall. To me, a mounted
and framed photograph is the ultimate reward for all the work that goes into
digital photography.
Here’s a gallery of tips for mounting and framing photographs:
 Plan for doubling the image size to determine your frame size. If you’re
printing 8×10-inch prints, your frame size should be 16×20 inches.
 Purchase pre-cut, acid-free mats. I find this the easiest and fastest way to
mount my photos. You can choose to cut your own mats, of course, but
make sure all your materials are acid-free. Acid-free materials help guaran-
tee that your photos will be preserved over long periods of time without
the chemical reactions some materials can cause with photographs.
 Use durable metal or wood frames. I see a lot of frame kits at a cheap
price. Yes, they come with pre-cut mats, but the frames are often made
of plastic, and are not of very good quality. Spend the extra money and
purchase quality frames and mats from reputable manufacturers such as
Neilson Bainbridge. Most art-supply companies carry high-quality frame
kits that come with pre-cut mats ready to go.
 Display your work! You work hard taking photos and perfecting them in
Photoshop. Take the time to print, mat, and frame your photos. Hang them
up on the walls of your home, and look into displaying your framed photos
at work, school, art associations, or your local bookstore-and-coffee shop.

Ten Great Photoshop Filters 
M
ost of the chapters in this book explain technical stuff — you know,
workflows, file management, raw conversion, overall corrections, 
editing, and printing. Really, it’s fun stuff if you’re a photographer; we need
to do all those things! Once in a while, however, we need to have some fun
with our photos. I’m not talking about cheesy hacks like moving body parts
around images of politicians downloaded from the Internet (though those can
be a hoot), I’m talking about applying some cool effects to use on your own
photos, using Photoshop filters.
Some filters — in particular, the Liquify filter — are simply outrageous. You
can do some quick morphing of photos of friends and family (and get in a lot
of trouble in the process) or focus on bringing out the sensitive artist in you,
adding strong or subtle effects to your images. I often use some of the Artistic
filters to enhance portraits and landscapes in the direction of fine art. Then
sometimes a silly impulse strikes, and . . .
A-Morphing We Will Go
One of the goofiest Photoshop filters (well, actually,
maybe the only really goofy filter) is the Liquify filter.
This is the utility you can use to enlarge ears, shrink
eyes, and mess around with other parts of your
image. You don’t have to use it on photos of people,
you can always “morph” other types of photos too.
You’ll want to be careful though, morphing people
can get you in trouble!
But onward: Start out with a decent photo like the por-
trait shown in Figure 14-1. Then figure out some fiendish
ways to mess it around with the Liquify tool. I decided to
transform this normally silly guy into a Vulcan, ears and all!

280
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Be sure to create a new layer you can use to apply
your filter to the image before you choose your
filter. If you don’t like the effect that the filter
applies, you can always delete the layer and create
another one to start over.
You can get to the Liquify filter by choosing Filter➪
Liquify. Figure 14-2 shows the image in the Liquify
window. I used both the Forward Warp and Bloat
tools to hack away at the eyes, nose, and ears,
quickly transforming this normally wacky guy into
a seriously troubled Vulcan. (Actually, I think it’s a
big improvement. Don’t tell him I said so.)

Getting Artsy with the Chalk & Charcoal Filter
Ordinary photos suddenly take on an
antique feeling when you apply the
Chalk & Charcoal filter. This filter
transforms a normal color image to
appear drawn with chalk or taken as
a nineteenth-century photograph.
Figure 14-3 shows an original photo
before this filter does its work.
Access the Chalk & Charcoal filter by
choosing Filter➪Sketch➪Chalk &
Charcoal. Figure 14-4 shows the
Chalk & Charcoal filter, with the
altered image displayed in the Image
Preview area. Adjust the charcoal
and chalk effects by moving the Charcoal Area or Chalk Area sliders to the
right (to increase the effect), or to the left (to decrease the effect).

The Sketch filter is one of the few 
filters that require you to convert
your images to 8-bit from 16-bit.
(To convert your images to 8-bit
mode, choose Image➪Mode➪8 Bits/
Channel.) Other filters that won’t
work in 16-bit mode are the Artistic,
Brush Strokes, Pixelate, and Texture
filters.
Figure 14-5 shows the finished image.
I added contrast by applying a Curves
adjustment layer, and then darkened
some of the highlight areas.
After you’ve chosen the Chalk &
Charcoal filter (or any Sketch filter), you can always change filters by clicking
the other icons in the Sketch filter choices.
Creating the Look of a Drawing 
with the Graphic Pen
Another Sketch filter that transforms a digital image into something that
looks more handmade is the Graphic Pen. Like the Chalk & Charcoal filter, it
converts the image to black and white, but the Graphic Pen gives your image
more of the look of an old-fashioned ink drawing. You can access the Graphic
Pen filter by choosing Filter➪Sketch➪Graphic Pen. Figure 14-6 shows the
Graphic Pen filter window.
For this image, I moved the Stroke Length slider all the way to the right to a
setting of 15, and then increased contrast by moving the Light/Dark balance
slider slightly to the right. You can choose the stroke direction by clicking
Stroke Direction and choosing one of its four options.

Adding Artistic Effects with the Glass Filter
One of my favorite special effects for abstracts is the Glass filter. I’ll usually
apply it to a landscape photo (preferably one with lots of color). Applying the
Glass filter adds immediate visual interest, even an artistic or abstract feel-
ing, to the image. You have some unique, glass-inspired looks you can apply
when you use this filter — such as an appearance of being viewed through
glass blocks or frosted glass — and it’s a paneless process. (Sorry.)
Try using an image you normally wouldn’t bother using — and apply a filter
such as the Glass filter to it. You may be surprised at how readily you can
rescue normal “throwaways” and turn them into works of art. The image
shown in Figure 14-8 (in the Glass filter window preview) is typical of an
image I normally wouldn’t bother using in my portfolio. But after I apply
effects such as the Glass filter (Filter➪Distort➪Glass), a relatively uninterest-
ing or plain photo takes on new life!

Figure 14-9 shows an original image (which I was never crazy about as just a

Caught Reticulating
The Photoshop
Reticulation filter recalls
the days of the chemical
darkroom; we used to get
this effect when develop-
ing black-and-white film.
We’d develop the film nor-
mally, and then soak the
film in ice water for 10
minutes. The ice water
would cause a small pat-
tern of cracks in the film
emulsion; when the film
was printed, the images
would show a pattern of cracks that could suggest (say) age or wear. The
Reticulation filter (see Figure 14-10) does the same thing, only digitally, with-
out any physical cracking of your image!
285
Chapter 14: Ten Great Photoshop Filters
Figure 14-10: Reticulation filter. 

286
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You can get to the Reticulation filter by choosing Filter➪Sketch➪Reticulation.
Using the Density setting, you can control how much of this filter’s distinctive
texture to apply to the image. The example shown in Figure 14-10 has a density
setting of 10 — a grainy look that’s much like what you’d get with black-and-
white film. You can experiment with reticulation by using the Density,
Foreground, and Background sliders. The effect isn’t to everyone’s taste,
but it’s appropriate for those who want to produce images with a fine-art or
old-fashioned look.
To add additional effects to get some really stunning graphic images, experi-
ment with using the different blending modes and opacity adjustments for the
layer you have applied the filter to. These settings are available to you on the
top portion of the Layer palette. 
Figure 14-11 shows an original color image, and the same image with the
Reticulation filter applied.

Painting with Brush Stroke Filters
The Brush Stroke filters
are especially popular
among digital artists.
Many photographers use
them to take “digital art”
to the next level; viewing
their images at art shows
and galleries, I can tell
they’re using the
Photoshop Brush Stroke
filters with success. You
can access the Brush
Stroke filter dialog box
(shown in Figure 14-12)
by choosing Filter➪
Brush Stroke.
The Brush Stroke filter is one of those filters that requires converting your
images from 16-bit to 8-bit mode. To do that, choose Image➪Mode➪
8 Bits/Channel.
There are eight different Brush Stroke filters to choose from, each with unique
painting effects you can customize with individual adjustment sliders. Choose
a colorful photo, and experiment with each one. I’ve provided examples of a
few in Figure 14-13.

Adding Texture to Photos
A great way to add texture to images — a technique many digital artists
prefer — is to use the Underpainting filter (shown in Figure 14-14). This is one
of the Photoshop Artistic filters; you get to it by choosing Filter➪Artistic➪
Underpainting. There are four textures you can add to your photos with this
filter: canvas, sandstone, burlap, and brick.
Figure 14-14: Adding a subtle texture with the Underpainting filter.
I find that the canvas and burlap textures work best for portraits, such as the
one shown in Figure 14-15. The textures give the photo an appearance of being
printed on a textured surface — without having to go through the hassle of
having that professionally done. I’ve seen high-end portrait photographers
use a combination of these filters with different papers, with excellent results.
If you want to add some classy effects to your photos, the Underpainting filter
is a good addition to your bag of tricks!

Bring Out the Artist in You 
with the Watercolor Filter
Photography is an art form — and if
you’re like me (one who couldn’t
paint a closet, let alone a watercolor
painting), you can still become that
artist using yet another artistic filter:
Watercolor. Start out by choosing
a colorful photo that you’d like to
see as a painting, and then choose
Filter➪Artistic➪Watercolor. Fig-
ure 14-16 shows the Watercolor filter

Part V: The Part of Tens 
As with some photos I apply filters to, I normally wouldn’t have used this
photo for my portfolio. By applying the Watercolor filter, however, I’ve given
the image an entirely new “feeling” and it becomes more interesting. As pho-
tographers, we all have some photos that never make it past Bridge to be
processed in Photoshop. We have a tendency to pick the best photographs,
and process those — but even the “rejects” have possibilities. Take a look at
photos you’ve skipped over in the past, and apply some Photoshop filters to
them. I think you’ll be happy with some of the results!
Figure 14-17 shows the original photo, and then the watercolor creation I cre-
ated with it.

Adding Cool Glowing Edges
Want to take an already-abstract
photo like the one shown in Fig-
ure 14-18, and make it even weirder?
The Glowing Edges filter can do just
that. It automates that old art-class
project where you color solid swaths
of color onto a small rectangular
piece of cardboard (bearing down
on the crayons to leave many layers).
Color over the whole thing with black,
and then use a sharp object to etch
Figure 14-18: Original photo.

a picture with outlines that expose the solid colors in the layers. I always
thought those projects were fun, and they wasted a lot of class time! Well, get
ready to take that to the next level.
The Glowing Edges filter, shown in Figure 14-19, is accessible by choosing
Filter➪Stylize➪Glowing Edges. When your photo is first displayed, it looks
transformed into a very black background with some glowing, colored edges
around the subjects of the frame. You can adjust the effects of the glowing
edges by adjusting the Edge Width, Edge Brightness, and Smoothness sliders.
Figure 14-19 shows the Glowing Edges filter and the image with the filter
applied.
Figure 14-19: The effects of the Glowing Edges filter.
Using the Lighting Effects Filter
One industrial-strength addition to Photoshop is the Lighting Effects filter.
This filter, shown in Figure 14-20, can take ordinary photos and apply lighting
effects that you just could not duplicate while shooting. After choosing which
lighting type and style looks best for your photo, you can click and drag the
lighting guides in the image preview to redirect or resize the lighting effect.

Figure 14-20: Lighting Effects filter.
Three light types — Directional, Omni, and Spotlight — are available to you;
you can apply a multitude of styles to each one of those light types. The com-
binations are endless, and you can have a lot of fun experimenting with each
until you get the cool lighting effects you want. Figure 14-21 shows the origi-
nal image, shot at midday (not ideal conditions), and the photo after the
Omni light type and Flashlight style were applied.
