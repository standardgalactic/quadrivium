Establishing 
Good Journalistic 
Practices
Putting Business Reporting into Context
Why should anyone want to be a business reporter? Is reporting on industry 
and the economy an important business?
The role of the business journalist has taken on increasing importance over the  
past few years as conjunction with major economic changes have roiled  
the world. And it will become even more important as economic crises continue 
to shake and reshape the social environments of almost all the countries of 
the free world.
So business and economic journalism is arguably the most exciting branch of 
journalism today and will remain journalists’ most solid career choice going 
forward.
The Business Journalist
What’s required of you, the business journalist?
You must be completely accurate. You must be completely impartial. You 
must have a nose for news. Business journalism is mostly investigative work.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 1 | Establishing Good Journalistic Practices

And investigative journalism has the biggest effect on the everyday life of the 
ordinary citizen.
As a business reporter, you dig out and report on issues that can immediately 
or ultimately affect the average person’s predicaments and choices. The busi-
ness journalist is the professional who alerts and informs ordinary people 
about such personally interesting issues as job losses and opportunities, rising 
medical costs and declining housing prices, food shortages, and the factors 
affecting investment income and paychecks.
Note
■
■
  Business journalists must be impeccably accurate and impartial. And you must understand 
your role in society—you are reporting on stories that affect many people in the community one way 
or another.
Who, What, Where, When, How—and Why
All cub reporters are taught that their stories must answer the standard 
descriptive questions: Who? What? Where? When? How? They are also 
taught to ask the overarching sixty-four-thousand-dollar question: Why? Yet 
too many members of the journalistic profession around the world fail to ask 
that big question and thereby fail in their first duty as journalists.
Why do so many journalists fail to ask, “Why?” Some journalists are simply 
lazy. They perform what is scathingly called “protocol journalism”—get the 
press release and just print it or broadcast it. In so doing, such journalists do 
no more than an office drudge would do at the copier machine. So why pre-
tend to be a journalist?
Others simply do not understand that as journalists they must report the 
impact that stories are going to have on their readers, viewers, or listeners—
in other words members of the community at large. And yet that is their 
responsibility; that is their commitment to their fellow human beings.
In business journalism, reporters need to ask, “Why?” They need to dig out 
the facts. They need to report accurately on everything they can, because 
business and economic journalism reveals important things that affect every-
body. And they need to analyze it intelligently and contextualize it usefully.
A Cautionary Tale
On a visit to eastern Ukraine, I was entertained at the offices of a major news-
paper by senior staff members. During the conversation, they told me about a 
substantial overseas investment in a steel plant there.

Business Journalism
3
The size of this investment was big enough to warrant international attention, 
so I contacted a colleague at Dow Jones Newswires, the international busi-
ness and financial news agency in London. His editor put a reporter on the 
story and swiftly the news went around the world.
Essentially, the story was that a Swiss steel company had decided to invest 
$100 million in two casting machines in the steel plant. These machines would 
eventually produce 2 million metric tons of steel plate a year.
International investors were keen to know such information because it gave 
them signals about the wisdom of investing in a region about which they knew 
little. Why did the Swiss invest in this machinery? Is the total output of this 
plant going to increase? Is the steel market expanding? Are there new export 
factors that triggered this move?
Those questions needed to be asked because if any of the answers were in 
the affirmative, then the overall steel production of the region would expand. 
Lacking training, the journalists in the news office I visited hadn’t thought to 
ask them. It was a prime example of protocol journalism.
Yet the implications of this news were vitally important to the local popula-
tion. It might have been the harbinger of more employment, the rejuvenation 
of plants, an injection of cash into the community, and the return of prosperity.  
On the other hand, the local consequences might be negative: Would the 
machines do the work once done by manual labor, such that jobs would 
decrease and local people would be thrown out of work? Would local shops 
get more business or less? Would food producers see an increase or decrease 
in their revenues? What effect might the investment have on tax revenues?
These questions would have been running through the minds of thousands of  
people who in one way or another would be affected by this event in the steel  
industry, and it is up to the business reporter to provide the information. 
What on the surface seemed a dull economic story might in fact have pro-
vided dozens of human interest stories and yielded critical information to 
people with hopes and fears about the investment’s impact on their daily lives. 
When communism collapsed, the welfare state went with it. So just what 
would this event mean to the local populace if workers were made redun-
dant? How would their families support themselves?
This incident was sadly symptomatic of much journalism in mature as well as 
emerging democracies: write what you are told and ask no questions. But the 
role of journalism in any country is to inform, to ask questions, to provide 
answers, and to sharpen social awareness or even crusade on social issues.

The Importance of Business and  
Economic News
The biggest recent growth in media has been in .business and economic news, 
especially since the financial crisis in 2008 and the ensuing problems experi-
enced by almost every country around the world. Although business and eco-
nomic reporting has always been an important component of media output, 
the demand for business news has grown as free market principles have taken 
hold around the globe, and so have the number of journalists who report it and 
the editors who see it as an important part of their news coverage. Business 
news is the cutting edge of investigative journalism and increasingly makes the 
major headlines in newspapers and the lead stories on TV or radio. Reporters 
and writers of business news are accordingly ever more important.
Business news is also essential to the operation of stock markets. When  
companies are publicly owned—that is, when shares are held outside the  
company—legislation demands full and open disclosure of information. 
Business news agencies such as Dow Jones and Reuters are an integral part of 
this disclosure. Western stock markets as well as individual companies work 
closely with them to ensure that information is released at exactly the same 
time to all media to avoid any charges of concealment.
Stock markets are springing up all over developing regions such as the Balkan/CIS,  
so it is important that reporters in such countries establish a relationship 
of trust and cooperation with market management. Most of these stock 
exchanges don’t have the sophistication of Western market establishments, 
but journalists can assist in their development by introducing reporting skills 
and practices when writing stories about their local exchanges.
The Need for High Journalistic Standards
Business reporters have a big responsibility to ensure that they observe the 
general rules governing the practice of journalism. Being a competent, honest, 
and impartial journalist is essential when reporting on business, the economy, 
and government. If journalists get their facts wrong or let opinion take over 
from independent reporting, they may cause people to lose their jobs, prevent 
inward investment, or encourage corruption and incompetence in govern-
ment or corporate affairs.
Reporting on business, the economy, and financial matters doesn’t mean that a 
journalist has to be a businessperson, economist, or accountant. In fact, most 
people in these professions make bad reporters. What journalists do is tell a 
story. In the case of specialist reporting such as business, journalists need to 
have a fair knowledge of the background to their story, but they do not need 
to be experts. Reporters must never be afraid to ask. And they need to be 
good storytellers, first and foremost.

Business Journalism

Tip
■
■
  Top Journalists are news gatherers and disseminators, assessing what information is 
important and then relaying it to the public in as appealing and revealing a fashion as possible. 
Therefore, writing skills, broadcasting talents, voice development, and even modes of dress are 
important.
Code of Practice
Media talks constantly about the need for freedom of the press, but that 
freedom can be secured only by responsible reporting. Freedom demands 
responsibility.
Journalists are not usually closely regulated by law. Unlike medicine and the 
legal profession, it is possible to practice journalism without being required 
to follow a compulsory professional code—hence the international concern 
when the British media were threatened with government regulation following  
the Leveson inquiry into phone hacking.
Here are a few guidelines that the responsible and sensible journalist should 
always remember. These guidelines are substantively included in voluntary 
codes in a number of countries with a free press.
Journalists should never give or take a bribe or gift in any 
• 
form.
Journalists should not let politicians, businesspeople, 
• 
public relations officers, or spin doctors play confidence 
tricks on them.
Journalists should not allow themselves to be coerced. If 
• 
the story isn’t an honest one, it’s no good to anyone.
Journalists should never allow someone who claims they 
• 
know the owner of their newspaper or broadcast station 
to put pressure on them.
Journalists must be impartial and should not be financially, 
• 
politically, or emotionally involved in the story they are 
reporting.
Journalists should be fair and honest, and they should not 
• 
mislead interviewees, sources of information, or their 
audiences.
Accuracy is vital. Published information must be correct. 
• 
Conflicting information should be assessed and placed in 
context. Mistakes should be publicly corrected.

Chapter 1 | Establishing Good Journalistic Practices
6
Reporters should provide subjects a fair opportunity to 
• 
reply.
Financial journalists must refrain from taking personal 
• 
advantage of privileged knowledge.
Reporters should ask themselves how a journalist should 
• 
react to public relations departments, including govern-
ment spokespeople and politicians. How satisfactorily 
and impartially do these departments handle the flow of 
information to the media?
Modern news gathering techniques mean journalists must 
• 
react to the speed of current technology and reporting 
modalities. Nonetheless there is never any excuse for 
not producing accurate, presentable, and timely news. 
Accuracy, credibility, and truthfulness must never be com-
promised by the need to be “first with the news.”
Confident in her journalistic due diligence, a journalist 
• 
must vouch for her story and robustly defend it against 
criticism or claims of inaccuracy.
Business journalists face trying pressures in both new and old economies: 
bribes, promises of holidays, new cars, and many other blandishments to write 
a story that is not quite in keeping with the facts. Resist giving in to such temp-
tations. Maybe you won’t be found out, but the feeling of pride in a story well 
researched, well written, and above all accurate and true is much greater than 
looking at a brand new automobile and knowing you sold your professional 
integrity to get it.
An essential tool by which you make sure you have tried your hardest to 
establish the facts is conducting interviews with the key players associated 
with your story.
How to Conduct Interviews
Most journalists will have to interview people to gain the information they 
need. Here are some points of good practice to follow:
Remember to prepare for the interview; do your home-
• 
work on a story and the issues involved.
Ask questions directly, properly, and as simply as possible. 
• 
Don’t try to impress an interviewee with your knowledge 
of the subject: news people are there to gain information, 
not to show off.

Business Journalism
7
Set the interviewee at ease, listen to the answers, and 
• 
respond to the conversation. Don’t interview by rigidly 
following a list of questions you have noted down before 
the interview. The only question you really need to pre-
pare is the first one.
Stay in command of the interview. A reporter has no 
• 
divine right to receive answers—but he or she has a per-
fect right to ask the questions. Discourage interviewees 
from saying, “No comment.” Point out that it makes them 
look as if they have something to hide.
Tip
■
■
  TV reporters should become skilful in editing the text of an interview on location. You may 
not have time to do anything but a quick phone call or you may not have electronic editing facilities 
available when you return to base.
After you’ve conducted your interviews, it’s time to write the story.
How to Write the Story
First, identify your audience. Who are you writing for? Who are you broad-
casting to? Is your news agenda geared to the public who want to know what 
is going on? Make sure you are not writing because, as a professional, you think 
you know what they need to hear or read. Don’t be drawn into speculation or 
giving a “personal” view. All stories must be based on facts.
Rule
■
■
  The golden rule of journalism is that there is no golden rule. Journalism is not an exact 
science; each story needs a different treatment and a different angle. Much of journalism is about 
debating the issues and looking at them with a fresh pair of eyes.
The watchword for writing a news story is "keep it simple—or KISS (Keep It 
Simple, Stupid.) Use words that the public will understand, not those that will 
impress the boss.
Discuss story angles with colleagues. For example, what is the impact of a 
workers’ strike? Will it trigger unemployment? What does that mean to the 
local economy?

Chapter 1 | Establishing Good Journalistic Practices

Tip
■
■
  When writing a story, bear in mind the limit on the number of words that you can use. It will 
be different for each medium—text, television, and radio—but there is always a restriction, so make 
sure every word counts.
Keep these guidelines in mind when you apply the familiar formula that a story 
must have a beginning, a middle, and an end. To hook the viewer or reader, 
think of how you might begin telling a story to someone standing near you—
“A big steelworks in London has gone bust!” or “Stocks took a hell of a dive 
today!” The language might need improvement, but these lead sentences do 
grab the attention of the reader.
After you have established a lead, select the key facts to back up your story. 
Use sentences that are short enough to be understood easily but not so sim-
ple that critics could say you’ve come straight from kindergarten. Do not make 
them so complex that they are incomprehensible unless read several times. 
Where possible use the active voice: “The government today announced …” 
not “An announcement was made today.…”
The onus for clarity is on you, the writer, and no one else. Always ask yourself: 
do I understand what I’m writing? If I don’t, then others will have no chance.
Journalists must also realize that people do not remember everything they are 
told, even through the very powerful medium of television. In assessing and 
writing stories, remember to tell them, remind them that you’ve told them, 
and then remind them that you’ve reminded them.
Finally, be ruthless in editing your own piece. Do not try to cram in every fact 
you have researched, and avoid clichés and jargon. See how the story reads 
once you have finished it, put it aside for a little while, then re-read and if nec-
essary tweak it to ensure it is telling a story accurately and intriguingly.
Note
■
■
  If you publish something that is factually wrong, put a correction on the record. Journalists 
are human. They make mistakes. Admit to an error, correct it, but don’t be overly defensive about it.

Writing Effective 
Business News
The business journalist must be exceptionally careful in practicing basic 
reporting skills because the slightest error can have a profound effect on 
readers’ lives.
On one occasion a journalist at a major newswire agency reported that UK 
interest rates had been raised. The markets were thrown into a panic because 
there had been no indication from any reliable source that this was about to 
happen. In fact, the news was about Irish interest rates and the reporter had 
made a simple error. The mistake was corrected after about 60 seconds; but 
in that time, millions if not billions of pounds had shifted on global markets, 
stock prices went haywire, and directors had been ordered to assemble for 
urgent meetings in head office boardrooms. This simple journalist error had 
monumental consequences.
Caution
■
■
  One of the major dangers in the practice of business journalism is that familiarity 
breeds contempt. Many journalists cut corners, bend under the pressure of deadlines, and produce 
sloppy work through overconfidence. Don’t be one of them!
In addition to being hypervigilant about accuracy, business journalists must 
take extreme care in other areas related to writing. In this chapter, I describe 
not only the basic skills a business journalist must have, but I also include tips 
for writing effective news leads (also known as ledes) and stories.

Note
■
■
  Throughout this book, the lead sentence or paragraph of a story will be spelled lead. 
As an old hack, I still use lead, as indeed most other old hacks do. The obsolete Middle English 
spelling lede was revived to distinguish the lead referring to a lead-in sentence from the differently 
pronounced lead referring to the thin strip of metal used in the days of hand-typesetting to separate 
lines of type. Lede crept into the US news business in the 1970s and is still confined mostly to the 
United States. So readers must forgive the clash of culture (as well as spelling) here. The main lesson 
to be learned from this is that a good news story has conflict, and this is as good a journalistic conflict 
as they get!
The Basic Skills of the Business Journalist
The practice of good basic journalism is of huge importance to the business 
journalist. In undertaking the role of a business reporter, it is wise to live by the 
code of basic skills employed in every major newsroom in the world. These 
skills, though not always directly related to the writing process, will make you 
a better journalist and ensure that your stories have maximum impact.
Keep Good Records
First and foremost, it is essential that you keep a full and accurate record of 
the information you gather in day-to-day newsgathering activities.
In the old days, the notebook was king. Today it is more likely to be the iPhone 
or digital voice recorder, electronically recording each word, both question 
and comment.
Note
■
■
  Again, here is an interesting clash of cultures. The training for certification by the UK’s 
National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ) includes shorthand as a required course, and 
this certificate is recognized by the British government and most major UK news enterprises. Yet 
of all the countries I have worked in, Commonwealth nations such as the UK, Australia, and New 
Zealand seem to be the only countries that require shorthand of entry-level journalists. Because 
digital voice recorders are generally not yet allowed in various institutions such as British courtrooms, 
it makes sense.

Business Journalism
13
The importance of keeping records is obvious. Challenges are made every day 
about what was said in an interview or as a comment, and journalists above all 
are open to the charge of misreporting or taking things out of context.
Always ensure that you have a fallback record of what was said in case you 
later need to establish the accuracy of your reporting. Never slough off estab-
lishing who you are interviewing and where the interview took place.
REMEMBER THE BASICS
I was once in a news meeting with a now very famous broadcast journalist who sat 
frozen with fear as the deadline for the arrival of a very tough news editor drew near. 
He muttered to his colleagues that he was likely to have his head ripped off because 
he had just come back from an interview and had forgotten to ask the name of the 
interviewee.
Keeping your head on your shoulders is essential, both for the veracity of your 
work and the safety of bodily parts from angry news editors.
Know Your Style Guide
Almost all major and most smaller newsrooms have style guides. This is the 
way the newsroom reports material in its writing or broadcasting of news. 
Style guides are intended to be a map, guiding the journalist in the “way we do 
things around here.” For example, style guides prescribe house usages such as 
when to capitalize a job title and when to spell out numbers instead of writing 
numerals.
In Britain, each publication, radio, and TV newsroom has its own style guide, 
drawn up by editors both past and present. In the United States, editors and 
publishers tend to favor a more national approach, often using The Associated 
Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law.
Double-Check Your Work
Use the library. Mostly digitalized now, reference materials are readily avail-
able through the computer terminal. But to gain information from yesterday’s 
newspapers, which can be an important news source, especially in smaller 
outfits, the newspaper is usually stored on a shelf or hung up on a peg, giving 
easy access to the publication. Use this facility as a double-check against error. 
Many a report has had copy in Monday’s newspaper that a stock lost 5 percent 
of its worth, only to find reference to that in Tuesday’s paper as 50 percent.

Chapter 2 | Writing Effective Business News
14
The Internet is a wonderful research aide, but again be careful and double-
check. Output information is only as good as input information, and if the 
person who fed the data into the machine makes a mistake, then it can be 
multiplied in a thousand places and a thousand times by those who simply 
“cut and paste”—not to mention the mischievous who delight in misleading 
journalists through website rubbish.
I once asked a class of young journalists to research the history of the story 
of Dick Whittington. Historically, Whittington was a 13th-century Lord Mayor 
of London. Folklore had it that he came to London as a vagrant accompanied 
by his cat and ended up in high office. The students used the Internet for their 
research. Their stories contained “facts” that Whittington was a real person 
(true) and had one to four wives, several cats, and left a fortune or died penni-
less. All this, they claimed was on the Internet. But what was really true?
Ask Questions
Before writing a word, understand what is required of you and, if in doubt, 
ask before going about a story. Too many journalists don’t understand what 
the story is that they are being asked to cover. As a consequence, they often 
report on a totally different set of facts than their editors planned. If you don’t 
understand your brief, ask the editor until you are sure you know what the 
story is about.
Never be afraid to ask, especially if you are dealing in stories from Wall Street 
or the City.
Note
■
■
  There are two common terms in business parlance which I suppose could be considered 
jargon. But they are so commonly used in financial circles that there’s no sense in fighting them.  
The City—the City of London district in central London also known as “The Square Mile”—is often 
used as a metonym for the UK’s financial services sector, which is largely based there.  Likewise, 
Wall Street is a street name that is used as a metonym for New York’s financial district and more 
broadly for the US financial markets as a whole.
When I converted from general news to business journalism, I knew nothing 
about the financial sector. But I was no spring chicken and asking questions 
was second nature. I recall asking a City of London guru about bonds and 
what a coupon was. There was an embarrassed silence in the newsroom, but 

Business Journalism
15
the guru patiently explained to me how bonds are priced, sold, and yield 
interest—and indeed that bond is another name for debt.
That guru became a good friend and has often remarked that I was refreshing 
as a journalist because I asked the basic questions without embarrassment, 
while others often pretended to know what they were talking about and mis-
construed a story as a result.
Don’t be afraid to ask, and call me stupid if you want to.
Keep Your Opinions to Yourself
Don’t give way to personal opinion. Making sure your story is factually correct 
is your responsibility, and you must give a full and balanced view of what you 
have seen and learned. Some UK reporters, for example, came under consid-
erable criticism when the 2008 recession began for using terms such as “the 
government’s savage spending cuts” or “hitting the poor who can’t afford to 
feed themselves.” Possibly these statements were true, but without support-
ing evidence, they became editorial comments.
Get the facts. And in doing so, once again don’t be afraid to ask people with 
specialist knowledge—such as analysts, brokers, asset managers, and bankers—
what it is you want to know. They are often as pleased that you have asked 
them for simple advice as you are to get the precise technical information.

  If you use an exact quote, you must attribute that quote to the expert who said it.
Writing Effective Leads
Every story begins with a lead. The lead is the introduction to your story and 
often contains its most important point or points. The job of the lead, once 
written, is to entice readers or viewers into your story.
The style for a lead that is used today came from the days when the main 
means of communication was the telegraph, or wire, that stretched from coast 
to coast across the United States—and, hence, the term newswire services and 
such newspaper titles as The Daily Telegraph.

Chapter 2 | Writing Effective Business News
16
Newspaper and television news organizations observe different rules when 
writing a lead. For newspapers or wire text, sometimes a descriptive para-
graph can lead into the story. This example of a lead is from a British middle-
market tabloid newspaper.1
Feeling blue may not be all bad when it comes to enjoying a good night’s 
sleep. Those with bedrooms this colour tend to get the best rest and wake 
feeling happy and positive.
The writer was clever with words, but it is a newspaper lead that backs into 
the story. A broadcaster would never get away with backing into the story but 
might rather say: “Researchers say that the color of your bedroom walls can 
dictate how well you sleep.”
For broadcast news writing, the most important information is always in the 
“top line” of the story. A writing pyramid can then be constructed, with ever 
more information being added in descending order of importance.
The format for radio and television is constructed as a pyramid for a variety of 
reasons, but the most important is that the audience needs to be “captured”—
compelled to listen to the story. The traditional bold headline to a newspaper 
story isn’t available to the broadcast journalist (although of course headlines 
are used in a different way), so the news reader has to barge into the story 
straight away.
Newspapers can indulge in an inverted pyramid in which a more relaxed and 
less direct introduction can be used. Not all newspaper editors accept this 
format, however. The former crusading editor of the Sunday Times, Sir Harold 
Evans, claimed that newspapers should follow the pyramid style of the broad-
cast media. And some do.

THE ORIGIN OF THE LEAD LINE
Early newswire copy was written in the pyramid style because journalists using the 
wires over vast distances such as those from say Los Angeles to New York were well 
aware that the vagaries of storms, animals, and vandals could disrupt the wires at any 
time. So they got out the most important part of the story first. They created what is now 
described as a “lead line.” Thus the “wire” stories could still be understood even if the 
writer was unable to deliver more than just the first sentence and the wires went dead 
thereafter.
Here’s an example of a pyramid-style lead line:
President Reagan has been shot.
The story has been told, even if more detail is eventually required.
So a style was created that was both necessary because of hostile environ-
ments, but crowd-pleasing because the news was spat out early in the story. 
Facts, figures, and more detail were then added on in order of importance to 
provide a longer and explanatory story. Both reader and copy editor could 
stop reading whenever they liked but could still get the basic information the 
reporter had related.
So the basic style of a short, sharp first paragraph in news copy was set many 
years ago and still has its advocates today.
EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK
Young journalists often fall into the trap of trying to put every fact and figure they have 
researched into the first line or sentence. I always called this sort of lead as having 
“everything in it but the kitchen sink.” As an editor, when I saw this sort of headline, I 
would yell across the newsroom “Kitchen sink!” Reporters immediately knew what was 
wrong with the story and rewrote it quickly.
Leads in Authoritarian Regimes
There is a great temptation in journalism in the new democracies to follow 
the old style of communist journalism. In authoritarian regimes, the ruling class 

Chapter 2 | Writing Effective Business News

was always far more important than the actual news story. So a ­newspaper 
article would begin something like this:
President Georgy stood outside the presidential place today in a dark 
blue suit, a red tie, and with his wife at his side. The marble arches of the 
palace glinted in the morning sun, reflecting the aura of the presidential 
party as a crowd of onlookers pressed up closely. The presidential palace, 
which was designed by the president’s grandfather, is located on Palace 
Street, noted for its avenue of trees, leading up to the gilt-coated entrance 
doors. The President announced he will resign.
Almost any reader, anywhere in the world, would have given up on the story 
before it had even begun. Sadly, there is still a tendency in some of these coun-
tries not to change, which is worrying because the circulation of readership 
of all newspapers can be as low as one percent of the population and few ask 
why this is so.
Finding Your Lead
Finding a lead line can sometimes be a problem for even the most experienced 
journalist. To overcome this difficulty, try thinking of how you would start to 
tell the story to a friend or your family if they were with you and asked what 
stories you were reporting that day:
The U.S. Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates.
or
Champion steel works has gone bust.
These might not be ideal lead lines in themselves, but with a bit of tampering, 
they can be molded into a lead line that grabs the audience.
Make it short, sweet, and to the point.
Things to Keep in Mind When Writing  
Your Story
Once the lead is written, each additional paragraph will add more detail to 
the story. Once again simplicity is the key. Use straightforward language that is 
easy to read. In addition, keep the following rules of good writing in mind:
• 
Wherever possible, use the active voice. “The cat chased the 
mouse” is more dynamic than “The mouse was chased 
by the cat.”

Business Journalism
19
• 
Avoid using jargon and other technical language, especially 
when writing about complicated subjects. For example, IMF 
is International Monetary Fund and WTO is World Trade 
Organization—so say so, at least when the terms are first 
used. You know what the acronyms stand for, but your 
reader might not know or at the very least has to think 
about it, thus interrupting reading flow.
• 
Spell it out. Some newspapers and magazines include in 
their style guide a descriptive word or phrase for compa-
nies to make sure that there is no mistake. For example, 
use the phrases “automobile manufacturer Ford Motors” 
or “insurance company Aviva.” This is not a bad habit 
to get into, no matter what your own style guide might 
suggest.
• 
Consider avoiding emotive words, especially if they are flagged 
by your style guide. For instance, Reuters tries to avoid the 
word terrorist, preferring guerrilla instead on the grounds 
that one man’s terrorist is another’s freedom fighter. Don’t 
carry your quest for neutral words to silly extremes, 
but do think about the emotive side of journalism and 
whether you are intimating some bias by an ill-chosen 
use of vocabulary.
THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCURACY IN BUSINESS NEWS
Writing news is a skill to be learned. Writing business news is one step further because 
the choice of words, the use of numbers, and the importance of accuracy means the 
business journalist must be extra careful. Sloppiness can have an effect on people’s 
lives, and unintentional mistakes can’t be covered by an apology if a slip of the tongue 
or an error of fact puts people out of work or costs them their life savings.
Practice, Practice, and More Practice
Writing good news copy for text, TV, or radio might seem like a minefield to 
those of you just starting out. I suppose it is. But take heart that it will eventu-
ally become second nature—like riding a bicycle.
Like any skill, writing news copy needs first of all to be understood and then 
practiced regularly. Be prepared to take constructive criticism from editors 
or mentors. For example, one of my nephews decided to study journalism at 
a university (not always the best place to get to grips with media reality). But 
his mentor was, like me, a grizzled old veteran of a UK national newspaper 

Chapter 2 | Writing Effective Business News
20
not noted for being gentle with cub reporters. My nephew told me that he 
was extremely proud of his first piece and then devastated when it came back 
with red lines through almost every sentence. But he stuck with it and is now 
a successful young reporter at a leading UK regional newspaper. Persistence is 
invaluable in the news game.
Too many entry-level journalists think that they will become famous colum-
nists five minutes after walking into a newsroom, only to find the reality is 
quite different. Ambition is a wonderful thing and I would never try to dampen 
enthusiasm. But to get to the top requires hard work, and novices need to 
plow through lots of routine tasks before being assigned to the seemingly 
dullest, most boring stories. In beavering away at these tasks, they are picking 
up the skills that must become second nature to them and will hold them in 
good stead as their careers progress.
Good journalists are made, not born. So while you are stumbling through the 
maze of journalistic skills—being accurate, developing a writing style, remem-
bering to keep records, double-checking everything, struggling with a lead, and 
laboring on pyramids—recollect that all the great journalists went through 
the same ordeal before emerging as masters of their profession.
Yes, the industry is changing. But those who grasp the basics of the profes-
sion (some say trade) will find the eventual rewards can be magnificent. My 
personal journalist hero was Walter Cronkite who, among countless honors, 
received from President Carter the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Not bad 
for a man who started out at The Daily Texan just like you, worrying about 
accuracy and style and all those irksome journalistic tasks—mastery of which 
helped make him a preeminent public figure honored by his country with its 
highest civilian award.
Key Points
Keep a record, written or electronic, of all conversations 
• 
and interviews.
Know and follow the appropriate style guide.
• 
Research carefully and don’t be afraid to ask.
• 
Understand how to lead into a story and write the lead 
• 
line carefully and precisely.
Avoid jargon and embrace plain language and simple 
• 
syntax.

Reporting 
for Different 
Business News 
Media
The basics of news writing outlined in Chapter 2 apply to all media, especially 
business media. The principles of accurate and credible news writing don’t 
vary from paper to paper or from TV station to TV station. What does matter 
is to know and understand who you are writing for: the nature and construc-
tion of the medium concerned.
If you work full-time for a publication, then it is relatively easy to follow an 
editor’s instructions, reflect the signature style of the paper, and cater to its 
target audience, because everyone else in the company will be doing the 
same thing. But if you are a freelance journalist, it is vitally important that you 
acquire a precise and intimate knowledge of the news outlet you are writing 
for or pitching to.

The Importance of Learning How the Various 
New Media Operate
The Internet has wrought major changes in the job opportunities for journal-
ists. A plethora of newsworthy and contextual information is available from 
Internet sources. (Caveat: Never use uncorroborated or unchecked material 
from anywhere—least of all the Web!) The adoption and dissemination of digi-
tal technologies have shrunk the permanent staffs in most print and broadcast 
organizations. But in tandem with that shrinking trend, the dependence of 
news organizations on freelancers has increased. Business journalism is one 
news sector that has generally escaped this shrinkage thanks to the increasing 
importance of business news across the globe.
All journalists—whether in-house or freelance—should understand the key 
components of whatever publication or broadcaster they are working for. 
Nothing is more needlessly painful than having an article or news story thrust 
back in your face because you failed to understand the nature of the organiza-
tion employing you.
There are literally tens of thousands of news outlets around the globe, many 
publishing in a single language and many others in multiple language editions. 
These outlets can be split into different categories, such as newspapers, maga-
zines, wire services, TV, radio, and online.
This chapter surveys a sample of major news organizations—mostly but not 
exclusively publishing in English—selected to represent the largest and argu-
ably the most globally influential information services.
Each of these has its own way of operating. Dow Jones, for example, is almost 
exclusively business and economic news, although it owns The Wall Street 
Journal, which also covers world and general news.
Reuters leans heavily toward business and financial news, but also has a strong 
TV unit and a world news division. Bloomberg, on the other hand, is best 
known for its TV news but also has other outlets in print and online. A large 
part of Reuters’ and Bloomberg’s businesses involve selling financial informa-
tion to banks, brokerages, and industry.
The news industry is extremely complex. Journalists need to understand the 
structure of the news industry and the spectrum of news enterprises in broad 
terms, as well as the particular profile and market of whatever entity you are 
writing or working for within a news enterprise.

Business Journalism
23
News Enterprises
The types of major business news enterprises vary a great deal, but they all 
fall into one of the main media categories described in the following sections: 
newspapers, newswire agencies, picture agencies (discussed in Chapter 12), 
TV stations, radio stations, business magazines, and general news outlets that 
feature business reporting within a general news concept.
Key Daily Newspapers
Three international daily newspapers—The Wall Street Journal, The Financial 
Times, and the International Business Times—are the biggest business and 
­financial newspapers in the Western world. High-circulation business news­
papers in other regions of the world include Nihon Keizai Shimbun in Japan and  
The Economic Times in India. Nationally important business newspapers 
include Germany’s Handelsblatt, Australia’s Financial Review, and Croatia’s 
Poslovni dnevnik.
Note

  Newspaper circulation numbers are a vexed field for comparison. The traditional rule of 
thumb in the newspaper industry for calculating eyeballs-readership was to multiply the number of 
paper copies sold by three. The rationale behind this calculation was that each copy would on average 
be passed among three readers. This calculation technique remains true of printed newspapers but 
many publications now include on-line readership in their circulation figures, although most show 
separately the numbers for printed copies and on-line.
These newspapers are all major entities in the business news market, and 
any journalist intending to report for them needs to be well versed in inter-
national business events and news and fluent in the language of publication. 
These do not constitute a definitive or exhaustive list of business newspapers, 
but they are representative of the major daily publications that specialize in 
business news. In addition, almost all newspapers carry some business news—
even red top tabloids such as the UK’s Sun, better known for its topless Page 3 
girls. Some newspapers give much more prominence to personal finance than 
to business and economic news but, even so, some form of business news is 
contained in almost all daily papers.

Key News Agencies
In addition to the daily newspapers, important general news agencies that pay 
significant attention to business and financial news include the following:
Agence France Press (France)
• 
Reuters (USA and UK)
• 
Dow Jones Newswires (USA and UK)
• 
AP and its TV arm APTV (USA and UK)
• 
UPI (USA)
• 
Jiji Press (Japan)
• 
RIA Novosti (Moscow)
• 
Xinhua (China)
• 
Most of these agencies have news bureaus in all the major cities of the world 
to help gather their international news. Dow Jones, for instance, has 85 
bureaus manned by more than 2,000 staff members. Of them all, Dow Jones 
is the agency that concentrates almost solely on business news, followed by 
Reuters.
Business News on TV
TV has seen an upsurge in business news outlets. The two most significant 
are Bloomberg TV and CNBC, which are totally dedicated business news 
channels.
Other TV companies such as Canada’s Business News Network, the UK’s Sky 
News Business, the US’s FOX Business News, and India’s ET Now (tied to the 
Economic Times) are also serious players.
Business Magazines
Notable US business magazines include Barron’s, Bloomberg Businessweek, Forbes, 
Fortune, and Harvard Business Review. Mainstream UK business magazines 
include The Economist, The Business Magazine, Euromoney, Marketing Week, 
and Investors Chronicle. A host of trade magazines publishing at various inter-
vals target particular business sectors and professional specialties—accounting, 
railways, hedge funds, maritime insurance, book publishing, and so on.

Caution
■
■
  Almost all business magazines need freelance submissions, but beware—the editors 
know what they are talking about and look for articles from reporters who also have intimate 
knowledge of the subject. Be sure you know what you are talking about before writing for them.
Business Radio
There are a large number of all-news radio stations that assign substantial 
airtime to broadcasting business news, especially in the United States. BBC-
affiliated radio stations in the UK give extensive coverage to business mat-
ters, as does the London-based private radio station LBC. But for the most 
extensive coverage anywhere in the world, Bloomberg’s name again crops up 
with Bloomberg Radio. Many of these business-oriented radio stations are 
online, whereas regional radio (sometimes called local radio) limits news to 
that which is of interest to local listeners.
Other Publications and Broadcast Media
Many publications, television stations, and magazines that are geared 
toward general news nonetheless devote time or space to business and 
economic news, including Al Jazeera, Russia Today, France 24, CTTV, CNN, 
CBS, BBC, CBC.
SO YOU WANT TO WORK AS A FREELANCER?
Because there is such a wide spectrum of news media outlets, the best advice for a 
reporter is to either work for one of them to learn their style, read one or two avidly to 
report as a freelancer, or become a specialist in some part of the business and finance 
sector so that your stories are filled with technical knowledge that makes your tale 
unique. Chapter 2 outlined the styles of writing used for various types of media. That 
advice holds true for any story writing you might do, so apply those guidelines to any 
reporting for the various media detailed in this chapter.
Broadcast Journalism
Many people believe print journalism and television news are related. It would 
be foolhardy to argue they are not, but they are distant cousins rather than 
blood relatives. The very nature of television—and radio for that matter—
makes the requirements of news gathering, news priorities, and story selec-
tion different from print. The techniques of writing, composition, production, 
and presentation for television and print bear few similarities, and there are 
few common tools required to do the two jobs.

  The differences between print and broadcast journalism do not mean newspaper reporters 
do not make good broadcast journalists or vice versa. But those who venture into television from print 
should be prepared for a whole new way of doing things.
The Development of Broadcast News
Radio and television developed differently in the United States from the way 
they did in Britain. Early in the century, major US news agencies refused to 
allow newfangled radio to have access to their copy. So broadcasters were 
forced to develop a whole new method of gathering and disseminating news. 
That gave rise to the beast known as the broadcast journalist. Cross-fertilization 
between American newspaper, radio, and television was not unknown, but it 
was—and still is—the exception rather than the rule.
In the United Kingdom newspaper people were key players in the early devel-
opment of broadcast news. This traditional link has remained. As the broad-
cast industry has become global and more complicated, however, broadcast 
journalism has become an accepted profession in its own right.
Best Practices for Broadcast Journalism
There are broadcast-specific best practices to be adopted and assimilated by 
those who aspire to broadcast journalism—whether they are print journal-
ists wanting to move to broadcast or professionals from other parts of the 
television industry.
The broad differences that “scribes” should note in writing for different busi-
ness news media is that newspapers generally require more in-depth report-
ing than broadcast pieces. In text stories, all questions should be answered 
in telling the tale (Chapter 2). Newspapers generally have the space to do 
this, whereas television news (documentaries aside) has very tight time 
constraints.
Generally, business news for text afford the option of writing some descrip-
tive text before hitting the real story, whereas broadcast news do not afford 
that luxury. Still, newspaper reporters shouldn’t get carried away and neglect 
putting the most important information close to the top.
Note
■
■
  A key element of television news is the mini-production known as a package—an 
item usually reported by a journalist on location and one of the most frequently used broadcast 
news methods.

Business Journalism
27
In modern newspapers and magazines, business news need more visuals than 
in the past to explain complicated stories. Reporters need to develop the 
skills and habits for creating and commissioning photos, graphics, and tables.
REPORTING FOR RADIO
Radio of course needs writing that is for the listener’s ear, rather than the reader’s eye; 
sentences must be crisp and short. In radio, news stories can generally only last for two 
minutes, and that includes a sound bite (an excerpt from an interview). The script will 
contain less information than a print story, so the picture building is very important. So 
sound effects, especially in business stories, are usually required. Sounds of buses, 
planes, factories, people talking, conference noises, the New York Stock Exchange bell, 
and telephones ringing—all add to building a visual image in the listeners mind.
“Writing to pictures” is an essential technique for TV journalism (Chapter 9). 
But abstract business issues often do not lend themselves readily to TV visu-
als. Reporting on a specific business is easy enough. A camera crew can shoot 
“custom” pictures of the enterprise by being on site with the reporter. But a 
story about inflation, which is more of a high-level concept than a visible event, 
calls for clever picture selection.
The same old visual clichés—money rolling off a printing press, the New York 
Stock Exchange opening or closing, the Bank of England frontage, a dealer in 
front of a computer screen, or shoppers going through checkout  —weary 
viewers through repetition. Worse, jaded producers call up stock footage  
that is anachronistic or anomalous, such as rolling a Christmas shopping scene 
in a July story.
Think out the words carefully. Don’t echo the pictures in words. A clip of coal 
miners leaving the pit should not have a script that says, “Coal miners left the 
pit this morning…” As with radio, time is of the essence: stories generally run 
from about a minute to three minutes, and that includes a sound bite of at 
least 20 seconds.
Try to keep the story interesting with wide-angle shots, cutaway shots, and 
panning. But beware when you pan. If you don’t leave two or three seconds 
before each pan, editing will be a nightmare and result in jump cuts, a phenom-
enon known to make viewers dizzy.
Finally, add credibility to the story by doing a piece to camera (PTC) in 
which you speak directly to the viewers through the camera. This instills 
trust in the story by proving to viewers that you, the reporter, were actu-
ally on the scene.

Chapter 3 | Reporting for Different Business News Media

Reporting for Online Journals
More and more reporting is done for online journals. These generally should 
be anything up to 500 words per page. This can be in a free-flowing style, but 
all other journalistic rules apply. Get them wrong and you may trigger conse-
quences no less disastrous to yourself, your employer, the subject, business, 
and your readers than if you got them wrong in print journalism. No matter 
what the medium, business reporting is a serious business.
Key Points
Before you begin reporting, you need to understand 
• 
the nature of the publication you are writing or broad-
casting for.
There is a wide range of newspapers, magazines, TV, and 
• 
radio that cover business issues.
It’s important to understand the differences in producing 
• 
business news for print, TV, and radio.
Always use medium-appropriate techniques that add 
• 
credibility to your story.

Establishing 
Sources of 
Information
So how does a business journalist go about getting the information he or she 
needs to write a competent and well-balanced story?
Well, a business journalist is like any other journalist really. He or she has to 
get information by asking, digging for, and analyzing information. Is this tough? 
Yes, but surely that is the very essence of journalism, the very reason most 
reporters choose this profession, the root of the challenge of being a jour-
nalist. Getting information is not simple, and I would not suggest to budding 
business reporters that it is.
This chapter will show you just how challenging—and rewarding—your job as 
a business journalist can be.

Rights and Responsibilities of the Media
As members of the media, businesses journalists must keep the following 
points in mind:
Business journalists have no divine right to receive 
• 
answers, but they have a perfect right to ask questions.
Business journalists are not infallible, but they must try to 
• 
get to the truth of a story when perhaps there are many 
who would prefer to obscure that truth.
Business journalists have a responsibility to report a 
• 
story—and if they can’t get cooperation from business, 
then they must find other ways to get the information.
Fortunately, businesses journalists have many opportunities to gather informa-
tion, starting with their contacts.
Contacts: The Life Blood of the Journalist 
As a journalist, you need to build as good a picture of what is going on as 
possible. In pursuing a story, you must avoid being drawn into speculation 
or giving a personal view. That doesn’t mean that the reporting stops if the 
owner of a business refuses to talk or answer your questions. There are many 
ways for you to discover what is going on in an industry. Speak to competi-
tors, union representatives, workers, bankers, or any number of people from 
your contact list.
Note
■
■
  As your career progresses, it is essential that you build up your contact list. These people 
may one day become key sources of information.
To ensure success in your stories and in your career, it’s important to build 
up a regular list of contacts comprised of government officials, other journal-
ists, entrepreneurs, business club members, bank personnel, business owners, 
politicians, and representatives of such organizations as NGOs, trade associa-
tions, international bodies, unions, and chambers of commerce. Invest the time 
in getting to know what’s going on even when it’s not worth reporting; get an 
overall picture, be well informed, and also be respected by your contacts.
Every journalist should keep a list of helpful people and their contact details—
telephone numbers, e-mail, addresses, and so on. You should also try to find 
out people’s private home and mobile telephone numbers, so you can call 
them out of hours or out of the office, where it may be difficult for the person 
to speak freely.

Business Journalism
31
Obviously, some of your contacts will be more important than others. 
Politicians, top business figures, key union personnel, police chiefs, mayors, 
and charity leaders all need to be on the contacts list and all spoken to on 
a regular basis. Others will not figure prominently in day-to-day stories but 
nonetheless should be cultivated for background, leads, and network.
Contacts are a reporter’s life blood. Journalists need to nurture contacts, stay 
in regular touch with them, and make them almost friends. Only by developing 
a network, gaining their trust, and doing a first class job on the story when 
using their information will you be able to access material other reporters 
don’t have—and be able to break news stories.
As reporters we depend on tip-offs; we need information from people who 
live, work, and play in walks of work and life that journalists have little knowl-
edge of and even less access to. Sure, reporters must follow up and check the 
accuracy of these leads. But without the lead in the first place, there is nothing 
to follow up.
Tip
■
■
  Don’t accept any information as fact except from a proven reliable source, unless you 
corroborate it from at least two other independent sources.
THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTACTS
In my early days as a young reporter in Vancouver, I was handed the police beat—a 
seat at the “cop shop,” as it was known. It was a great place to learn the tricks of the 
trade, and I made the most of it. I got to know not only police officers but also lawyers 
from the adjacent courts.
I was busy on the phone one morning, all alone chasing stories on a slow news day, 
when a young lawyer I had got to know stuck his head into the pressroom and with a 
cheeky grin said, “Courtroom Three in five minutes.”
I duly presented myself on the press benches in the courtroom and looked at the docket 
to see that the case involved a murder. On the surface it seemed a fairly routine case 
and was indeed a preliminary or “first” hearing.
The bare outlines of the case were read out, and then my lawyer friend said that 
the prosecutor was going to ask for the death penalty. There was a collective gasp 
around the courtroom, even from the judge. The death penalty in Canada had been 
abolished five years before. There was no death penalty: or so I and most others on 
that day thought.

Chapter 4 | Establishing Sources of Information
32
In fact, the Canadian government had placed a moratorium on hanging for five years, 
not an outright ban. This particular court case was five years and one day after the 
start of the moratorium, which the bright young lawyer had discovered was now lapsed 
because the cabinet in Ottawa had forgotten to renew it.
It was a great story and an exclusive one to me. It of course had all sorts of 
repercussions for government, for the legal system, and for that matter was a wake-up 
call to hardened criminals who now faced death by hanging if the murderers in this 
case were found guilty.
In the event, the Prime Minister called a cabinet meeting very quickly and extended the 
moratorium.
But it was a great story, and it came to me by nurturing contacts.
Human Nature
Human nature also plays a large part in providing news tips. People like to 
see their names in print or have their faces appear regularly on the television 
screen. One business analyst told me that his firm valued publicity so much 
that it was written into its employees’ contracts that they must attempt to 
appear on business programs a set number of times each year or forfeit their 
bonuses.
Contacts are often key figures holding important positions in well-known 
organizations, but they may also be secretaries or even taxi drivers. It is strik-
ing how many people who might be considered insignificant nevertheless see 
and hear what is going on and can provide nubs of information that can turn 
into really good stories.
The wise reporter will try to ensure that such willing interviewees have really 
got something newsworthy to say or are not exaggerating a circumstance to 
become “famous” for five minutes.
Most good journalists develop a “nose” for such informants and can very 
quickly intuit the difference between the publicity seeker, the time waster, and 
the contact who adds real value to a story and believes that the public has a 
right to know what is really happening.
Tip
■
■
  Don’t get so caught up in looking at the specific story that you close your eyes to the “social 
factor” that you can inject into stories. Never underplay the importance of the community and the 
contribution your story can make to life in that community.

Business Journalism

Emergency Services
Most American and Canadian radio and television stations have a very thor-
ough system of checking on news stories.
Each day calls are made at least twice to hospitals to follow up on stories. For 
instance, when a story is initially filed as a motor vehicle accident, the names 
of the people involved and the hospital to which they are taken goes onto 
a list. Those names are checked every day to see whether the condition of 
the patient gets worse or better. If a patient dies, then the story changes and 
becomes reportable.
Emergency services are always the targets for daily phone calls. In the US, it 
is very likely that reporters will have a pressroom in a major police station. In 
the UK, many reporters will check a police contact at least once a day. In most 
newsrooms there is a list of calls to be made by the desk duty journalist, which 
will include some if not all of the following:
police department
• 
customs
• 
highway/traffic police
• 
traffic control
• 
fire department
• 
rescue service
• 
ambulance service
• 
hospitals
• 
coastguard
• 
mountain rescue
• 
cave rescue
• 
weather centers
• 
Some newsrooms listen in to the radio transmissions of the emergency  
services, which is acceptable in America but notionally illegal in the UK. 
Sometimes in the US, police dispatchers alert the press to an incident by 
saying quite plainly—“Commercial media please note”—and giving relevant 
details of a stolen car or a bank robber.

I was on duty in a Vancouver radio station on the night of the famous D. B. Cooper 
hijacking and given a blow-by-blow description by the King County Sheriff’s office as 
the plot unfolded.
D. B. Cooper was the name given to an unidentified man who hijacked a Boeing 
727 aircraft in the airspace between Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, on 
November 24, 1971. He demanded and was given a $200,000 ransom, then parachuted 
out of the aircraft somewhere over the Washington State countryside. He was never 
found or properly identified; and, apart from a few notes, the money was never recovered. 
The case remains the only unsolved air piracy incident in American aviation history.
That story would never have been reported in real time as it happened had it not been 
for good contacts and regular checks by desk journalists.
You may well ask why a business journalist should bother with emergency ser-
vices. The fact is that the immediate story might not be of that much interest. 
But newspapers and broadcast bulletins are full of cutbacks in police funding, 
fire stations being shut down for budgetary reasons, or ambulance services 
becoming inefficient because of lack of staff. These are all good business  
stories and often come to light because the business reporter has developed 
the same contacts as his or her general news counterpart.

  Never underestimate the knowledge and skill that you as a reporter will acquire as a 
specialist correspondent. Over a period of time, reporters will find they have extraordinary access to 
industrial, business, political, and community leaders, which will give them knowledge far beyond the 
boundaries of others.
Forward Diary Systems
A forward diary system, in which important stories are logged for action at a 
certain date in the future, is often used. Sometimes the date is a specific time 
when an event is going to happen, and sometimes it is an anniversary. In either 
case, it’s a good source of potentially breaking news.
There are commercial diarists such as the London-based Future Events News 
Service (FENS), which has a substantial staff doing nothing else but searching for 
upcoming events. FENS offers dates of important events in its World, Business, 
Entertainment, and National sections, covering the UK, North America, Asia, 
and Middle East. The diarists sell the lists contained in the diary to news 

Business Journalism

organizations to assist with planning for future news events, and it is widely 
used by global media. This helps alleviate the need for onerous phone work. 
FENS is a major international news events organization; but many cities—for 
example, Washington, DC—list domestic events taking place, and these are 
also useful aids to future planning.
Tip
■
■
  Useful as commercial diaries are, good journalists keep tabs on events from their own 
contacts and only supplement a look ahead with information from services such as FENS.
Once it is announced that the president or queen or other head of state is to 
be present at a place or event, then it is logged in the newsroom for an alert 
to be made so an editor can assign reporters, resources, and other require-
ments to ensure proper coverage is given according to the importance of the 
story and the pertinent protocol for handling the press corps.
The White House provides the press corps a press room, reporting facili-
ties, and a close relationship with the President’s press office. Number 10 
Downing Street, in contrast, has no such press facility. There is a press office 
with information officers working for the prime minister and the government, 
but journalists are invited in for a news story and are not given access as an 
absolute right.
Since threats and a mortar bomb attack on Number 10 in the late 1980s by 
the Irish Republican Army, Downing Street has been blocked to the public, and 
the press needs a special pass just to be allowed to stand outside the front 
door. My colleagues and I have spent many miserable hours in the pouring rain 
outside the famous black door waiting for the prime minister of the day to 
appear to make a statement or introduce a visiting head of state.
The press corps in the Houses of Parliament is treated quite differently. There 
is a press room, a press bar, a press gallery inside the debating chamber, and 
for a special group of journalists called “lobby correspondents” access to 
members of Parliament (MPs) in the Members Lobby, a circular domed area 
set between the House of Commons (lower house) and the House of Lords 
(upper house), where parliamentarians gather to talk and informally debate. 
These lobby correspondents have unique access to the MPs and can use infor-
mation they are given privately as long as they don’t attribute the quote.
For example, a story might open with the lead: “A source close to government 
said today that a new trade agreement between Britain and the United States 
could be signed by the middle of next week.” The source might well have been 
the minister of trade himself who wants to alert the country to an imminent 
trade deal but who won’t make an official announcement until the day the deal 
is to be signed.

But the real point is that no UK organization, public or private, is under any 
obligation to provide facilities or lines of communication to the press, TV, or 
radio if they don’t want to. Most do so because it is in their interests to have 
good relations with media. But there is no obligation.
The News “Patch” or “Beat”
General reporters in searching for news should carve out a “news patch” also 
known as “beat.” The “patch” for a business reporter is more environmental 
than geographic. The business news patch might include contacts at stock 
brokerages, banks, institutions such as the Bank of England or The Federal 
Reserve, and insiders at large corporations and businesses.
Then there is the opportunity to have special patches within a patch. My 
own were the air and beverage industries. I had great contacts within British 
Airways, plane makers Short Brothers (now Bombardier), and ship builders 
Harland and Wolff, who diversified into building “air bridges”—the walkways 
between terminal buildings and aircraft when you board or leave airplanes.
I likewise had contacts with brewers, distillers, soft drinks manufacturers, and 
the famous stout maker Guinness. It didn’t mean that I was exempt from 
reporting on and indeed knowing about other things. My job as anchor for 
PBS’s Morning and Nightly Business Reports demanded that I be familiar with 
the whole of the business and finance sector. But my specialties were drinks 
and airplanes.
I have flown in new aircraft on maiden British Airways flights, including the 
Concord, toured Boeing’s works in Seattle, and watched the Flying Boxcars 
coming off the assembly line at Short Brothers in Belfast. I interviewed a 
Russian pilot who was displaying a spy plane at the famous Farnborough Air 
Show. He instructed me not to touch a red lever in that particular cockpit 
because it was the trigger to send the seat shooting out of the plane into the 
air in the case of something going wrong. I sat very still during that interview.
On another occasion I was sent to a small wine shop in London’s Covent 
Garden to interview a man who was auctioning off a red wine that was fetch-
ing several hundreds of dollars a bottle. The story behind the price was that a 
wine called Le Pin had been given a top American wine critics’ maximum rat-
ing in 1982, but with the proviso that it should be drunk immediately because 
it was not good for “laying down” for future use. The wine was expensive (but 
not outrageous) because only 700 to 800 cases were produced annually by a 
small French vineyard.
In 1996, someone discovered some cases that had been mistakenly kept back, 
and the same wine critic declared he was wrong and Le Pin 1982 was better 
in 1996 than when it had been bottled. The wine world went mad and the 

Business Journalism
37
few cases left, numbering dozens rather than hundreds, created a bidding war, 
sending the cost skyward. I can remember calculating that one glass of Le Pin 
was valued at about $800.
I interviewed the owner of the wine shop handling the sale and generously 
asked if we could have a glass of wine in our hands while doing the interview. 
I hastened to reassure him that I didn’t expect him to open a bottle of Le Pin 
as that would mean a very expensive interview for him. But he insisted and I 
sat sipping on an $800 dollar glass of wine while talking and I was in seventh 
heaven.
After the interview was complete, the owner’s partner came into the store 
and joined us. The owner immediately said, “Charles, I’d forgotten just how 
good this wine is. Let’s have a bottle for lunch.” More than $10,000 worth of 
wine disappeared in minutes just for the sake of a business news item, and 
$800 of that was sitting in my stomach!
I hasten to point out that this was not only a wine story, but a commodities 
story as well. The bidding war on the product bore less relation to the high 
quality of the wine than to the small quantity of cases left in the world to 
be bought.
On another occasion, I travelled to Northern Ireland to do a story of a take-
over by the massive French drinks company Pernod Ricard of the famous Old 
Bushmills Distillery. Again, for reality’s sake, I ended my piece raising a glass of 
Irish whiskey to the camera and expressing approval in my face. As a tribute 
to my usual ability to do just one take in my pieces to camera, I proudly bear 
the professional sobriquet, “One-Take” Hayes. Yet on this occasion it quite 
uncharacteristically took me 18 tries to finish off the story!
This digression illustrates how cultivating a “patch within a patch” can result 
in some in-depth stories that bring no less delight to the reporter than to 
the viewers.
Your “news patch” can have any sort of focus. It may be a geographical area 
in which you get to know the community and its concerns. This is especially 
important for business journalists in severe economic downturns. Why are 
shops closing? What government support for small business is there, if any? 
Are there too many types of one particular shop? Is the competition hurting 
them all, or is there an unusually high demand for whatever they are selling? 
There are a thousand questions—and perhaps a thousand stories.
Everyday Conversations and Eavesdropping
Don’t just limit your contacts to influential people. Sometimes they are a 
group concealing stories rather than being outgoing with information. Join in 
conversations in a pub, or coffee bar, shop, or market, or anywhere that people 

Chapter 4 | Establishing Sources of Information
38
congregate. You might hear a dozen conversations that are inane babble. But 
you might also get a feel for what is troubling people, such as a bad pedestrian 
crossing where there are fears that one day somebody might be killed. There 
is the start of the story, a story that might well lead to reportage on a city’s 
budget and its fiscal priorities.
Reporters should be full of curiosity and should be constantly asking 
questions. Try to get to the point where people start contacting you with 
story ideas.
Eavesdropping is another good way of finding out what is going on! It 
makes you feel like a sneak sometimes, and indeed investigative reporters 
often lose friends and family because they use information picked up at a 
social occasion.
THE HEROISM OF INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING
Investigative reporting is a true journalistic art. But before deciding that is a role for you, 
beware of the cost that many very good investigative journalists have to pay.
Often they work in danger; many times they work on a story for months only to see 
their hard work fizzle out when the story can’t be proved. But mostly the worst cost is to 
domestic life and how such endeavors can impact on the home and family.
There is, and I suppose always will be, a romance about investigative reporting; 
and indeed, when the big stories break, investigative reporters become famous and 
heroes.
Across the Balkans, in seminars of say 50 journalists, 48 participants would declare 
their intention of becoming an investigative reporter. Our answer to this huge desire 
to take on the world was for me to produce a friend who was a very good and very 
successful investigative journalist.
Together we took a little dramatic license over his appearance. But he would enter the 
room, unshaven, wearing a dirty and stained raincoat, a half bottle of whiskey bulging 
from his pocket as he shuffled to the podium. It was a bit exaggerated but he would then 
relate his life as an undercover reporter with no holds barred. Then I would ask the 50 
journalists who still wanted to be an investigative journalist. Rarely did more than two 
hands rise into the air.
Yet one of the best investigative journalists I ever met worked in the Balkans. She was a 
lady in her early thirties who uncovered massive financial corruption in the government 
that went to the very heart of the country’s finance ministry. She was shot and badly 
wounded, banned from press conferences, vicious rumors were circulated about her 
personal life, her young family was threatened, and she had to move home. She was a 
brave contributor to her country’s welfare, yet never received the accolades from fellow 
journalists, government, or international organizations that she so richly deserved.

Getting to the Facts
So the answer to the question of how does a journalist, general or business 
reporter, get the facts, is that it is through hard work, patience, and application.
Using the phone, e-mail, and Internet, sometimes for hours on end, is the very 
basic way to get information. It is simply hard work. Knowing lots of contacts 
in a whole variety of fields is another. No journalist should be without a little 
black book, both to keep a contact list up to date and also have a name and 
number at hand if there is an urgent need to get expert comment.
I keep coming back to the same theme though. Getting news is hard work 
and needs great application by reporters young and old. Nowhere is this truer 
than for the business journalist.
The skill for any successful reporter, however, is knowing where to look. And 
sometimes reporters can’t see the forest for the trees. Sources are sometimes 
so obvious that they are missed or ignored. Everyone who works for a news 
organization, from the receptionist to the chief executive, should be feeding 
the newspaper with ideas for stories. So the entire staff is the first resource 
of newsgathering. Journalists who sit back and wait for news to come to them 
will rarely succeed. That’s why those who have drive and determination make 
the best reporters. It all sounds so simple, doesn’t it? Well, the skill of being a 
journalist isn’t that complicated.
However, understanding the sector can be complex; and while sticking to the 
basic principles of journalism, young or new reporters need to build their 
knowledge about business, the economy, and financial institutions as they go 
along until they have a thorough understanding of the topic. That doesn’t 
mean to say that I have contradicted myself from earlier advice, which is to 
ask the experts. But the more knowledgeable reporters become in their 
field, the better they can get information that will enhance and help illustrate 
their stories.
I have deliberately given examples of important stories that came from good 
contacts, hard work, and the perils of investigation. These illustrate how to 
look for news.
But the fact is, for the average reporter, the news comes from simple hard 
work on the phone, listening to people, and then following up with talking to 
knowledgeable contacts.
Pretty dull stuff until the story is put to bed. Ah, but then there is no feeling 
on earth quite like it.

Enterprise 
Stories
The big business newswire organizations such as Dow Jones and Thomson 
Reuters put great stock in enterprise reporting—reporting that is not 
prompted by news or a press release but rather is developed from scratch 
by a reporter digging into sources. Enterprise reporting is especially exciting 
for any journalist because it is totally his or her own story. The information 
is not based on the rewrite of a press release or information given out at 
a news conference. Instead it is about taking a small nugget of information, 
digging into it, and claiming ownership of it.
Enterprise reporting goes beyond just covering events: it is about identifying 
something that just doesn’t seem to fit and exploring why. Sometimes the clue 
is a gut feeling of uneasiness or incongruity in response to something read or 
said; other times it is a simple observation that begs the Why question.
Turning a Simple Question into an  
Enterprise Story
I was in the city of Calabar in Nigeria with some local journalists. As we were 
driving along one night, I noticed that on one side of the street, lights were 
blazing and the area was clean and smart, while on the other side it was dark 
and shabby.
I casually asked why there was such a contrast in such a short distance as the 
width of a street. My companions told me, with a nod and a wink, that the 
one side of the street voted for the state governor, while the other side didn’t.

It had not occurred to these journalists (who were not that experienced) that 
here was a story in the making. Research and a little digging to confirm their 
thesis could result in a good corruption story and even a story on the state 
budget. In fairness, once I had fired the starting gun, they were fast out of the 
gate in chasing the issue down.
That was an enterprise story.
Examples
■
■
  Business journalism is rife with stories exposing faulty and dangerous products, 
which resulted in manufacturer recalls and reforms of government business regulation. A deluge of 
stories on price fixing by retailers filed by UK reporters was started off by their spouses’ complaints 
about price hikes in supermarkets.
Turning a Simple Drink into an Enterprise Story
I once was a huge fan of English bitter beer. Offer me anything else and I would 
reject it with a sneering curl of the lip.
But the warm, dark, hoppy brew is not available in most countries of the 
world. Overseas, in fact, English beer is treated with the same contempt that 
Englishmen reserve for lager. (Traveling so much, I have had to drink various 
shades of lager in many countries of the world that I have, to my eternal 
shame, lost the taste for English bitter.)
Drinking lager in my local pub, I noticed a steady increase in the cost of lager 
beer on a fairly regular basis, while the cost of English beer, though rising, did 
so at a slower pace. I was disgruntled that my beer was disproportionate in 
cost to the English brew, so I set about researching why.
It proved to be a complicated story, but essentially a whole series of mergers 
and acquisitions had taken place in Europe, with large international brewers 
mounting hostile and accepted bids for some of the smaller drink makers.
These acquisitions were widely reported in the business media with a series 
of interesting stories surfacing over the boardroom battles for control. It was 
gripping stuff. But it was so gripping that business journalists had failed to note 
the steady increase in retail lager prices in the inns and taverns of Europe and 
especially in Britain as a result of these mergers.
A solitary reporter drinking (quite moderately) in a small town bar, however, 
picked up on this. I had my enterprise story.

  Covering breaking news is straightforward, but developing follow-up stories is far more 
challenging yet peculiarly necessary to the functions of the business reporter, who on a day-to-day 
basis is dealing with economic, government, and commercial affairs that impact on society as a 
whole but often conceal uncomfortable truths that need uncovering.
Turning a Simple Question into an  
Enterprise Story
An indispensable tool for unearthing enterprise stories is the reporter’s 
trained ability to observe. All journalists should observe everything going on 
around them as a matter of course. To generate good story ideas, they should 
develop and push their observational skills to the next step by treating their 
observations not as passive impressions but as continual provocations of the 
question “Why?”
For example, just filling up at a service station and discovering that the fuel 
costs a lot more than it did last time you filled up can lead you to questions 
that cannot be satisfactorily answered without deep investigation. Asking why 
led to big oil companies being investigated by the European Commission for 
price collusion in Britain. Plenty of good enterprise reporting helped expose 
the scandal and pressure the government and oil companies.1

  Watch out for change. If something changes, it should trigger the most important  
“W” question in journalism—“Why?”
From Police Blotter to Enterprise Story
Once the initial alarm bells have gone off, the next step is good old-fashioned 
digging. Often this means a lot of spadework and a lot of tedious delving for 
bits of information and data. (But if that tedium turns into an interesting or 
even spectacular story, there is no greater sense of satisfaction.)

Chapter 5 | Enterprise Stories

Enterprise reporting is allied very closely to investigative reporting. The main 
difference is that investigative reporters start their stories from a bad smell 
in the air, whereas an enterprise story really does come from a niggling suspi-
cion, a small nugget of information that sets a reporter to uncovering hidden 
information.
The information that led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon was 
an enterprise story prompted by a police blotter item that segued into an 
investigative story.
The initial item was simply a break-in. During the small hours of a summer’s 
day in 1972, a security guard in the Watergate Hotel in Washington noticed a 
door had been jammed open. He called police and five men were arrested in 
rooms rented by the Democratic National Committee.
It was simply a story for the police blotter until enterprise reporters discovered 
one of the burglars was a former CIA man who had notebooks linking him to 
the White House. That triggered closer media scrutiny and eventually uncov-
ered a “dirty political tricks” scandal that led directly to President Nixon.
Two young reporters from the Washington Post, Bob Woodward and Carl 
Bernstein, began an in-depth investigation of the incident and are credited with 
revealing a great deal of unique information as the story unfolded. Later the 
two reporters revealed that they had an informant inside the White House 
who was feeding them information. At the time he was nameless and given 
the epithet “Deep Throat.” Much later, Deep Throat was identified as Deputy 
FBI Director, W. Mark Felt, who was a longtime contact of Bernstein’s.
For any journalist, this story is worth examining just because it is one of the 
great stories in American, perhaps even global, journalism. But it particularly 
serves to demonstrate how a story can develop from a humble germ to spec-
tacular dimensions. It was also a story that only became possible through 
good and enduring contacts.
From Mock Press Conference to  
Enterprise Story
I was training some journalists in Bosnia who asked if we could get a top 
businessman to come and address us and be the guinea pig for a mock press 
conference.
Through our contacts at the British Embassy, we persuaded the CEO of a 
large industrial complex based in Sarajevo to appear. This man was so used 
to a compliant media that performing such a task gave him no apprehensions. 
The state-owned company was a newsworthy model because it was being 
showcased in the government’s privatization program.

Business Journalism
45
The executive gave a colorful account of the company, explained that already 
Siemens, a big German enterprise, was interested in buying it, that it had sev-
eral contracts in the pipeline, and that all was well with its sale.
The young Bosnian journalists, although very bright and energetic, were also 
brainwashed by protocol journalism practices and were overawed that such 
an important man should have agreed to attend their seminar. As a conse-
quence, their questions were almost fawning and certainly not incisive, and if 
this had been real it would not have contributed to any story about the suc-
cess or failure of the government’s privatization program.
But this executive hadn’t counted on having a Dow Jones journalist and a 
Reuters reporter (me) being there as trainers. The trainee journalists looked 
embarrassed at first that we should question this important man in such a 
direct and forthright manner. We were not rude, but we asked about the 
company’s import/export record; who at Siemens the company had talked to; 
if any prospective buyers or investors had been to visit the plant; how much 
of the enterprise the government was willing to sell; and several other queries 
about the sale of the company to the private sector.
To our questions, the CEO either provided very vague answers or proved 
unable to answer at all. It became painfully obvious that no real effort was 
being made to transfer the business to the private sector. This led to a second 
and more interesting story, inasmuch as the government had promised the 
international community, as part of its economic reforms, that it would follow 
a robust policy of privatization.
Giving the young journalists their due, the scales fell from their eyes and they 
followed up on the issue with enthusiasm. A few direct questions—and an 
enterprise story was at hand.
From Census Data to Enterprise Story
With a bit of hard work, a national census can lead to all sorts of enterprise 
stories. It means digging, but as a journalist you should be used to that.
Does the data show that there has been a surge in the number of children of 
primary school age, yet the government budget shows cuts in school funding? 
If the number of elderly has increased unexpectedly, has the government made 
financial provision for the increased costs of pensions and nursing care?
These are the sorts of economic stories that can come from the instincts of 
enterprise reporters. These are good stories that need exposing, stories that 
only you have, and stories that might provide you with a great scoop.
Use a slow news day to trawl for enterprise stories. You might come up with a 
yarn that is an important and exclusive story that might just shock your editor 
into the equally shocking act of praising you.

Look for simple things that seem out of place. This is a 
• 
good start for an enterprise story.
Watch for casual tidbits in day-to-day news stories that

might turn up an enterprise story.
Never mock a “mock” training exercise. Real stories can

be found there.
Look for stories hidden in public data such as censuses.

Ethics and 
Change
I have already made reference to ethics. But it can’t be stressed enough that 
whatever else journalists may do, they must keep any information they get as 
confidential until they can confirm it is fact.
The reporter must strive to produce the highest possible level in the quality 
of reporting. Every story has an impact on society—sometimes small, some-
times large. But if the tale is rooted in baseless data or hearsay instead of facts, 
the impact can cause untold damage, which the journalist ultimately may never 
be able to put right.
A Brief Definition of Ethics
Commentators define business ethics as written and unwritten codes of moral 
standards that are critical to the activities and aspirations of business organiza-
tions. Ethics is about having the wisdom to determine the difference between 
right actions and wrong decisions. It’s an organization’s codes of corporate 
governance, morality standards, and behavior of individual employees and the 
business as a whole.
Journalists have their own written codes, detailed in this chapter and touched 
on in Chapter 2, but the basic principle of any ethical consideration of  
journalism is that a clear distinction must be drawn and honored between 
news and opinions.

Chapter 6 | Ethics and Change

The Importance of a Code of Ethics
As noted in Chapter 1, many countries, professional associations, and news 
organizations have journalism codes and canons of ethics, conduct, and prac-
tice. US and UK codes are very similar, having at their core the principle of 
good practice as it applies to journalism. Media freedom is an essential clause 
of these codes which is of particular importance for business journalists; and 
the right of the public to be informed is essential to good practice.
Big business and financial institutions are not above applying pressure on 
journalists to turn a blind eye to some practices that are not in the public 
good. For instance, there have been cases of advertisers threatening to 
cancel their accounts with a publication if a story that is unfavorable to 
them isn’t dropped.
Such situations are especially difficult for business journalists because they are 
not really in control of dealing with such threats: it is usually noneditorial man-
agement. No one can tell a journalist what to do under these circumstances, 
but support for colleagues on an ethical level can sometimes ensure that a 
conflict is resolved in a positive way.
Business reporters need to be especially careful about the way they handle 
pressures to exempt from scrutiny businesspeople who may be engaging in 
unprincipled behavior that might cost jobs, damage communities or the envi-
ronment, and sometimes threaten life itself.
There is no easy answer, but subscribing to a code and an organization such 
as the Society of Professional Journalists (US) or the National Union of 
Journalists (UK), which will give some muscle to resisting such threats, can 
certainly help.

  Don’t accept gifts or bribes to write a story that is not true, and don’t use bribes or false 
promises to get information. That doesn’t mean that a contact shouldn’t be allowed to buy a lunch 
for a chat or that a reporter shouldn’t accept a free plane ride to see how an airline works. But don’t 
be put into a position where the information can’t be used in a story if it is uncomplimentary to the 
subject of the item.
Journalists should be free of obligation to any interest other than the public’s 
right to know.

Business Journalism
49
Unbiased Reporting
Impartiality is another important element of ethical values. Biased reporting 
can easily put a company out of business; this principle is exceptionally impor-
tant in business news because it is something that a reporter can do without 
meaning to, through inherent bias or hostility to activities.
For example, an environmental journalist might well feel that carving a new 
road through a beauty spot is destructive. But it is incumbent on journalists 
to give a balanced view of the issues and also of the company that is building 
the road. It is equally important to make sure that any inaccuracies in a story 
are corrected once identified.
Business, economic, and financial journalists can trigger enormous conse-
quences through their reporting and must always be aware of how influen-
tial they can be. Even so-called opinion columnists need to take an ethical 
stance. Columns that express an opinion must back up the opinion with 
facts and examples.
BIAS IN EMERGING ECONOMIES
Bias was one of the ethical issues that dogged journalism in emerging democracies as 
they became democratic. Shackled for decades by authoritarian governments, many 
media personnel couldn’t differentiate between freedom to report on an issue and the 
responsibility not to write whatever they wanted regardless of journalistic standards.
Adherence to Ethics in Obtaining a Story
One area in which even the most moral journalists have some problems is 
how to balance the ethical rule that material be obtained by honest, straight-
forward, and open means with the obligation to investigate a story in the 
public interest when pertinent information can be acquired only in an under-
handed way.
There have been many court cases where journalists have had to argue that 
they investigated stories in an unethical way because it was in the wider public 
interest. Courts are sympathetic to this argument; but because it is frequently 
left to the law to decide the morality of the issue, it is not a course that 
newspeople should embark on lightly.

Chapter 6 | Ethics and Change
50
Protection of a Source
Another ethical issue that often comes before the courts is concealing the 
identity of a source of information. Courts are often not very sympathetic 
to this argument, but reporters can often risk the safety of an informant or 
the flow of information if they reveal their source. There are many examples 
of “whistleblowers” (workers who report wrongdoing at work or in govern-
ment) being fired or demoted after revealing bad practice by industry, govern-
ment, and other civil society entities.
Within both US and UK codes, right of reply is prominent. This is very perti-
nent to business journalists because, once again, if subjects of an investigation 
aren’t asked for their side of the story and have a very valid argument for their 
actions, the consequences can be serious.
ADDITIONAL TIPS FOR ETHICAL STORIES
Here are some additional tips to follow to make sure your work is as ethical as it can be:
Make certain that headlines, news teasers, promotional material, photos, video, audio, 
graphics, sound bites, and quotations do not misrepresent people or situations. They 
should not oversimplify or highlight incidents out of context.
Never distort the content of news photos or video. Image enhancement for technical 
clarity is always permissible. Label montages and photo illustrations.
Recognize a special obligation to ensure that the public’s business is conducted in the 
open and that government records are open to inspection.
Journalists need to be accountable to their readers, listeners, viewers, and 
each other.
Accounting for Political Beliefs
It is not unusual to find that business and industry take steps to support a 
political party, through either donations or some other active support. It is 
not unjust for such donations to be made because the business believes that 
one party or another, if elected, will deliver an economic- or business-friendly 
environment suitable for it to trade and prosper.
No journalist should worry about a company’s political leaning unless he or 
she believes that the owner, or the business, or indeed that particular business 
sector, has been compromised by it. However, if it appears that the business 
is receiving direct favors as a result of its support—for example, govern-
ment contracts or state subsidies—then that in itself is a story worthy of the 
reporter’s interest and should be pursued.

Note
■
■
  A reporter’s own political beliefs should not color his or her reporting, especially if they are 
opposite views to those held by the businessperson.
It is not unusual that business and even government will be outraged by a par-
ticular piece of reportage. That does not mean that the report was incorrect. 
However, it has not been unknown for businesses to insinuate that report-
ers they find obnoxious are wrong or have a track record of getting facts 
confused—in other words, to discredit the reporters and their reports. So it 
is essential that records and notes are kept, especially on a contentious story, 
so that the reporter can back up the story and the assertions made in it.
Avoiding Protocol Journalism
Whatever you do as a business reporter, don’t indulge in protocol journalism.
Yes, it is essential that you look at every press release that you can. Information 
comes from them as a source. But don’t just repeat a press release. The 
content of a press release is what a company or government wants to say. It 
might be factual, or it might be tendentiously slanted toward what the com-
pany or government wants people to believe and therefore economical with 
the truth. Once you have the press release, do research as thoroughly as 
possible until you clearly understand what the story is, and then use all your 
journalistic skills to explain to readers or viewers, in the simplest possible 
terms, what exactly has happened or will happen and why.
Insider Trading
A cautionary note for journalists reporting on stock market news, even for 
the tabloid press: beware of getting caught up in an insider trading scandal.
Insider trading occurs when an individual or group of individuals who have 
knowledge about a company that is not generally available to the public trade 
that company’s listed stock. This practice can give such individuals an unfair 
advantage over other investors inasmuch as they know in advance of the 
market that a share is about to jump or fall in price.
Note
■
■
  In most countries, insider trading is illegal, and the penalties for those who get caught can 
be very severe.

Chapter 6 | Ethics and Change
52
The definition of insider trading varies widely according to the country. 
American and British reporters should be aware that many major business 
news enterprises ask employees to declare what stock they hold in their 
portfolios. The reporter is not allowed to report on companies in which 
he or she holds stock. Smaller organizations might not be that fastidious in 
monitoring their employees’ financial affairs, but lack of oversight does not 
absolve journalists from the same responsibility. Using knowledge about a 
stock through privileged information gained while researching it is illegal, and 
the penalties are severe. The cost of losing your job can be far greater than 
the gain insider trading might bring to your bank balance.
Changing Times
My involvement with journalists in emerging economies such as those of 
Kosovo, Bosnia, Lithuania, and Romania has broadly been an enjoyable and 
fruitful one. Most young journalists have a thirst for the profession but are 
often held back from maturing professionally by a system that developed 
under authoritarian rule and certainly didn’t encourage original thought or 
enterprise stories. Protocol reporting is such an embedded mindset that 
most veteran journalists are mentally blocked with engaging in real journal-
ism: asking questions, probing for answers, and not taking what they were 
told as fact.
Fortunately, for both journalists and the readers and viewers who follow them, 
times are changing. Reporters are beginning to ask questions. The fear of  
government or establishment punishments (especially losing a job) are lessen-
ing, and a more positive approach to tough questioning and serious writing is 
gaining strength as time goes by.
Freedom of the Media and Responsible 
Reporting
Journalists talk constantly about a free press while frequently omitting equal 
emphasis on the notion that freedom of the press must go hand in hand with 
responsible reporting. This is particularly so in emerging democracies such as 
the Balkans, South Caucasus, and CIS—but not exclusively so.
Because of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal in the UK, the gov-
ernment set up a government inquiry into how the press was regulated 
(Chapter 22). In fact, UK printed media until then had no statutory regula-
tions but was governed by a voluntary system known as the Press Complaints 
Commission, a self-regulating body. The result was that for the first time in 
200 years, UK media is now subject to terms listed in a royal charter, which 
has a committee that will act as auditor for a revamped regulatory system.

Business Journalism
53
Because illegal and probably immoral means had been used to access informa-
tion by phone hacking, stories using information from this practice by leading 
media organizations compromised freedoms previously enjoyed by the British 
press. As a result, reporters' activities will now be limited in scope. Hence, 
freedom of the media was eroded by irresponsible reporting from sections of 
UK journalists. This is a great loss to journalism everywhere, because Western 
governments have spent a great deal of cash helping revamp media regulations 
in countries that essentially controlled the press by government edict.
Most Western journalists have completed a university degree or recognized 
journalists’ training course; but in many maturing democracies, qualifications 
or practical experience are not required, and a journalist is simply someone 
who decides to call himself or herself a journalist. This has in many cases 
limited the understanding of media responsibility among practicing third-
world journalists.
It is understandable that there is euphoria among journalists who for decades 
have labored in a tightly controlled media at being let off the leash. But the 
result, at least initially, was a group of “reporters” who thought they were able 
to say anything about anybody without any facts to back up their stories.
Codes of Conduct in Emerging Democracies
It is important that all journalists—from countries with a strong tradition of a 
free media as well as those where democracy is a new concept—try to follow 
the voluntary local code of conduct set up by journalists for the industry and 
to familiarize themselves with government media legislation: what it includes 
and what they think as professionals it should include. Constantly review the 
impact these rules and regulations have on relations you as a reporter have 
with government and industry.
As a journalist, you should challenge the authorities if regulations make good 
governance of text and electronic media difficult in an emerging democracy. 
First, challenge regulation privately; then, if you have to, do it openly and pub-
licly—not necessarily as an individual but through a professional association 
or journalists’ club.
Some of the key elements in most journalists’ codes of conduct cover issues 
such as the following:
Don’t bribe or take a bribe.
• 
Don’t let politicians, businesspeople, public relations  
• 
officers, or spin doctors play confidence tricks on you.
Don’t allow yourself to be coerced.
• 

Chapter 6 | Ethics and Change
54
If your story isn’t honest, it’s no good to anyone.
• 
Never, never allow pressure to be put on you because 
• 
someone claims they know the owner of your newspaper 
or broadcast station.
Always ask yourself if you are doing the following:
Paying attention to accuracy
• 
Making provision for a fair opportunity to reply
• 
Recognizing privacy issues
• 
Avoiding any form of discrimination
• 
Protecting your sources
• 
Not taking personal advantage of privileged knowledge and 
• 
observing impartiality (especially important for financial  
journalists!)
A Test of “Real” Journalism
One journalist in a country that had been in the grip of a dictator told me of 
the hilarious situation she found herself in when she challenged the status quo 
and actually tried a little investigative reporting. For her efforts she was fired.
Crestfallen, she left the newspaper building and set off for home.
The next day she received a message that she needed to speak to the managing  
editor (a Western term … in communist times, no such post existed). She 
returned to the newspaper offices to find a straight-faced editor telling her 
(not asking her) that she was to resume her position as a reporter.
It appeared that when she was hired, no proper check had been made on her 
background. As such, no one had discovered that she was not a card-carrying 
member of the Communist party, which was a requirement for employment.
When senior staff had discovered that they shouldn’t have hired her in the 
first place, they panicked because their jobs were on the line if it was dis-
covered she had been hired illegally. So they told her to go back to her desk 
and resume her duties and not to tell anyone that she had been dismissed. 
That way, everyone kept their jobs. She carried on with her work, unencum-
bered with the fear of losing her job (she couldn’t be fired), and, as a result, 
when the regime fell, she found herself with an extraordinary reputation as 
a good reporter. As of this writing, she is still one of her country’s leading 
journalists.

Business Journalism
55
But the fact remains that protocol journalism has stuck and unfortunately 
can still be found in many countries where democracy has developed green 
shoots and journalists are reveling in newfound freedom.
But never mind the emerging democracies: journalistic Luddites can still be 
found in Western societies.
Embracing Change
When trade unions held enormous power in the UK media of the ’70s and 
early ’80s, change came very slowly, and many in the industry refused to accept 
that change was on the way. If nothing else, technology was beginning to have 
an impact on journalism, changing the way in which reporters, editors, and 
news crews needed to operate. A small example was the way that news was 
covered for television. Film was still the order of the day in the UK and news 
crews could sometimes be counted in double figures just to bring a single 
item to a bulletin.
In Vancouver in the mid-’60s, I worked as a producer/reporter with only a cam-
eraman and soundman/driver covering several items in a day with a camera, 
a microphone, and a 2-inch videotape machine in something that resembled 
a suitcase. Yet in the early ’80s in the UK, such versatility was often denied a 
reporter. And well into ’00s, archaic practices were still prevalent in much of 
the old Eastern Europe, Balkans, Baltics, and CIS.
The point about all this is that journalists, especially business journalists, must 
open their minds to change: embrace it, mold it to their own particular means 
of working, and understand the changes that are taking place on almost a daily 
basis around them.
When trying to enter into serious debate about change, the plaintiff cry can 
still be heard:
“But it won’t happen to us!”
“What won’t happen?”
“Change of course.”
It’s amazing how many journalists in countries across the globe take this view.
I am the first to accept that we have all only recently left behind a world where 
things were vastly different. But social upheaval and a revolution in technology 
have sent us rushing down a road to conformity that has left us breathless.
Caution
■
■
  Journalists who refuse to accept change—both that which has already occurred and 
that which is on the way—will be swept aside by it.

Chapter 6 | Ethics and Change
56
Sometimes change isn’t that obvious, and that’s when it is all too easy 
to fall into the trap of thinking it won’t happen—or at least that it won’t 
happen to me.
The Changing World of 24-Hour News
Jim Boulden is a familiar figure on CNN screens and a very able business 
reporter (Chapter 11). I worked with him at Reuters on the American PBS 
business programs Morning Business Report and Nightly Business Report, which 
were daily half-hour shows broadcast on PBS affiliates coast to coast in the 
United States. Feeling a bit inhibited with the restrictions that half-hour  
programs imposed on reporting styles, Jim switched his allegiance to CNN.
As most journalists do, I meet up with former colleagues who are also mostly 
old friends, and eventually the conversation turns from the old days to the 
new days. Jim and I recently sat in a good old-fashioned English pub, second 
home to many journalists, to swap stories over a pint.
It has been a few years since I have worked in a 24-hour news enterprise, and 
I was intrigued with what Jim told me about working at CNN. Many of the 
routines were familiar. Some things hadn’t changed that much. But Jim pointed 
out the subtle shift of 24-hour news channels over just a few brief years.
Here’s what he had to say about CNN’s daily routine.
It used to be the case that news output had a 20-minute window that high-
lighted the day’s events, mostly in an evening newscast. It was known as a 
revolving news wheel.
That is no longer the case. A 24-hour rolling international news wheel is an 
outdated model. Now, the news that is broadcast in any given 24-hour period 
is broken up to bring appointment viewing to certain times of the day.
It’s generally believed in news circles, and is backed up by research, that few 
people watch more than about 20 minutes of 24-hour news broadcasts in any 
one sitting.
Not so long ago, the concept was to simply repeat the same news every 30 
minutes. But advertisers didn’t like it. And viewers who did tune in and out 
throughout the day found it too repetitive. Frankly, those who worked on it 
found it boring and unmotivating. Simple—but boring and for the lazy.
Note
■
■
  The dirty word in 24- hour news nowadays is “dupe”—that is, to take the script from the 
last hour’s rundown and move it over to the next hour.

Business Journalism
57
So change took place, and that idea was replaced by a new concept, which was 
to neutralize broadcasting an hour’s news. Anchors and reporters never said 
“Good morning” or “Good evening”: the news sets never had a “morning” news 
scene and programs were no longer referred to as a “prime time” talk show.
Eventually, owners, managing editors, and above all producers and directors 
realized that this proved impractical and made for sterile news shows; people 
who work in news and those who watch the news, the all-important viewer, 
expect different things at various times of day and become consumers of them 
according to where they sit. The change in reporting techniques also made 
the job of a reporter more complex, so that a reporter could be expected to  
file a blog, a shorter version of a TV news package (in modern parlance these 
are called a “look-live” or “walk and talk”), as well as a 30-second explanatory 
piece called a “whip.” So, one story may have to be told to an audience in three 
to four different ways.
But change, my dear fellow, is part of all our lives—and now there is an even 
newer concept, which is to keep writers, reporters, producers, and present-
ers (anchors) working on the same part of the schedule each day, no rotation. 
The morning team in London is always the morning team. If you watch a chan-
nel in the middle of the night abroad, say while you are awake in a hotel in 
Singapore, you are likely to see the same anchor or anchors, whether based in 
London or New York or those just waking up in the Hong Kong bureau.
So, the modern answer to the age-old question of who these days decides 
what news to cover—and how—changes from hour to hour and from show 
team to show team.
This is a new concept. It means internal competition between news teams for 
limited resources (camera crews, video editors, and other human and technical 
facilities), and it means that when breaking news trumps all other news items, 
everything else in the news program is thrown out of the window, despite 
hours of work put into a show before the “crisis” news was known about. 
When the breaking news of a financial crisis crashes into a newsroom, chess 
championships have no chance of airing. The days of simply repeating news until 
a big story breaks are long over when it comes to a 24-hours news wheel.
Change has made these all-news stations (and there are now a plethora of 
24-hour news outfits) proactive in deciding what and how news is selected 
for broadcast and how to please an audience that only wants to watch for  
20 minutes a day.
As we downed our last pint of beer and departed from the pub into the night, 
both Jim Boulden and I agreed on one thing:
The business news sector is full of contradictions.

Chapter 6 | Ethics and Change
58
Everything can be challenged. For every rule there is almost always an excep-
tion. The key to controlling successful news and information output is open-
ing the mind and challenging the absolute. So, as Jim Boulden has come to 
accept, change is now swift but subtle, with adverse consequences for those 
who ignore it.
Key Points
Ethics are the written and unwritten codes of moral stan-
• 
dards that are critical to activities and aspirations of a 
business organization, including news media.
Big business and financial institutions are not above apply-
• 
ing pressure on journalists to turn a blind eye to some 
practices that might not be in the public good.
Biased reporting can easily put a company out of busi-
• 
ness; this principle is exceptionally important in business 
news.
Many journalists in emerging economies talk about a free 
• 
press but rarely grant that freedom of the press must go 
hand in hand with responsible reporting.
It is important that all journalists, from countries with a 
• 
strong tradition of a free media and those where democ-
racy is a new concept, try follow the voluntary local code 
of conduct.
The days of 24-hours news wheels simply repeating news

Making 
Economic 
Reporting 
Relevant
Headline: “Auto Industry in Crisis after Huge Worker Layoffs at …”
Once, not so long ago, even a dramatic story such as this would have been 
relegated to an inside page of a newspaper.
Now, business and economic headlines are the order of the day. Barely a day 
goes by when the headline news isn’t related to business or the economy. 
People want and need to know about pensions, asset values, shares, fluctuating 
house prices, and other key issues of daily life:
Are our jobs safe?
• 
Are taxes about to go up?
• 
Will savings produce real dividends?
• 
Business and economic reporting is now meat and drink to media enterprises; 
such is the impact it has on ordinary lives, especially in a society where wealth is 
increasing, even at a slow pace. Economic reporting is more relevant than ever.

Defining What It Means to Be a Business 
Journalist
There are three main branches of business journalism: business, economic, 
and financial.
The term business journalist has become the “catchall” term for reporters 
covering all three of these types of reporting because the business journal-
ist reports on economic change in a nation as well as reporting about major 
players such as CEOs, brokers, bankers, and other important individuals in the 
business world.
Economic journalists cover a more specific type of story within business, such 
as indicators of inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and consumer spend-
ing. From the indicators, expert analysts will forecast what is likely to happen 
to an economy such as recession or expansion. Economic journalists cover 
these predictions as well.
Financial journalists tend to focus on banking, treasuries, currencies, and the 
financial systems of a nation.
But as with most professions, drawing a definite line between these types of 
reporting is near impossible. Many business journalists cover all three.
So before we get into the real meat of this chapter, and to be clear, business 
journalism, according to Wikipedia, is “the branch of journalism that tracks, 
records, analyzes, and interprets the economic changes that take place in a 
society” and is used to describe coverage of financial and economic events as well.
This form of journalism is really no different from standard journalism in that 
it covers news and features and produces articles or stories about people and 
places. But business journalism focuses on issues related to the field of busi-
ness. Today, because of its relevance, most newspapers, magazines, radio, and 
television news shows carry a business segment.
A business journalist reports detailed and in-depth business news dissemi-
nated through all types of mass media, including print and digital publications 
and radio and television channels, and dedicated specifically to business and 
finance events, trends, data, socioeconomic consequences, and profiles of 
major players.
Business and economic journalism is a serious business. You have to know 
what you are writing about, which documents to look for, and which sources 
to use; and you need to know the appropriate place to look for the infor-
mation to make the story. While understanding the basic principles of eco-
nomics, a business reporter must above all instill the discipline of asking for 
information.

Business Journalism
61
Business reporters are not economists, analysts, or market makers. They are 
reporters. And although it is helpful to have an understanding that business 
is about a company’s profits, the importance of the stock market, and a busi-
ness’s future prospects, asking the real experts is the most important factor.
Why Business Journalism Is Relevant  
to Journalists
There are two matters to consider in the relevance of business events. One is 
the relevance of business and economic reporting to journalists and the other 
is the importance of business operations to the average citizen.
Considering the few examples at the beginning of this chapter, it becomes 
evident that there is much business news for modern journalists to report, 
much more even than just 15 years ago.
The amount of financial information available to journalists has grown as the 
Internet has grown and business newswire services such as Reuters and Dow 
Jones have expanded. Added to these phenomena is the rise of the business 
news channels such as Bloomberg and CNBC, which in turn has pressured 
newspapers to pay more attention to business news.
The financial institutions themselves also now demand information on what’s 
happening in the business and financial sector. It is impossible for bank and 
market analysts and stockbrokers to rely solely on their contacts and in-
house information centers. They need to know what is happening and they 
need to know what the competition is saying in analyzing a set of financial 
circumstances—and they need to know it now.
The globalization of business and commerce has also been a force in the devel-
opment of business TV and newswire services. Banks, brokers, businesses, and 
financial institutions can’t cover everything that is occurring abroad. So the 
reliance by the financial sector on news organizations, which have the means 
of gathering the news, has become a key factor in the development of business 
journalism.
All these trends have led to changes in the way financial journalism is pro-
duced, and some of the major changes are addressed in different chapters of 
this book. Therefore, business journalism is relevant to those who want to 
disseminate important information to a wide congregation of society; and the 
content of business stories is important to almost everyone. Business, eco-
nomics, and finance affect almost all our lives.

Chapter 7 | Making Economic Reporting Relevant

Why Business Journalism Is Relevant  
to Industry
Unless a business is listed on the stock exchange, it doesn’t have to tell you 
what its net profits or net losses are. But it is generally in a company’s inter-
ests to do so. Revealing this data can squash rumors that it is in trouble, can 
demonstrate that it is a company worth investing in or doing business with.
Losses don’t mean that it is a company destined for the scrap heap. There are 
a hundred reasons why a company can make losses in a certain period but still 
be a very healthy business. For instance, it might have restructured and made 
part of the workforce redundant. That could have been costly in terms of sev-
erance pay but given it a bright future because it has become more efficient as 
a result of that move. Nevertheless, in that particular year as a result of that 
particular cost, it could overall have shown losses or a reduction in profit.
Note
■
■
  I have mentioned that accuracy is a very important feature of business journalism and 
good business journalists will take that diktat on board and use it in their arsenal of weapons in 
reporting credible stories.
It is necessary therefore to try and get a proper picture of a company’s prog-
ress, and comparisons should be made over a similar period. For example, it 
might be necessary to compare revenues for one year against revenues for 
the previous year, or for a given quarter of one year against the same quarter 
of the previous year.
You should also try to determine what caused profit or loss in a particular 
company. Extra profits might come from expanding markets in a given sector, 
or losses might have come from a major fire at the plant. Explaining how a 
company has performed is part of the business journalists’ job.
Why should any business give out this sort of information when it doesn’t 
have to?
The business that is secretive will find it much harder to attract investment, 
partnerships, or even new customers. As more and more investment comes 
into a region, whether from other parts of the country or from overseas, busi-
nesspeople will be forced to become more transparent about their activities 
or face the possibility of serious consequences.

Business Journalism
63
Why Business Journalism Is Relevant  
to Society
The following observations are made to illustrate how important research, 
accuracy, and facts are in making business news relevant to “society.”
There is a prevailing belief that outside investment means someone puts cash 
into a business and then leaves it alone to get on with things. It would be won-
derful if that was the way things worked. There are many businessmen across 
Eastern and Central Europe rubbing their bruises because they believed that 
this was so, or that their governments would make it so.
Inward investment comes in a number of ways. There are investors who will 
place their cash in a company simply to see a profitable return. But they need 
to be convinced that the company is a first-class company, efficient, capable, 
and handling its finances properly before risking their capital. Much of what 
they learn in the initial stages comes from what they read in the press. They 
read what journalists write. If a company hid behind its doors and refused to 
let media have a peek inside, then its chances of attracting the “docile” inves-
tor are nil.
Investment might come from a partnership, where an outside company wants 
to participate with an existing company. This is not uncommon, but these sorts 
of investments come because the local company has shown it is a worthwhile 
enterprise as a profitable partnership. Yes, of course such investors will want 
to see accounts and trading statements and a host of other documents before 
making a decision. But generally, they will want to see what position and image 
the company has in its market, and that comes from the sort of information 
that the business journalist has been reporting.
Note
■
■
  Reluctance on the part of management to deal with business media might not be as big a 
hurdle as you think. There is a lot at stake for existing businesses in considering their future. Building 
knowledge about their activities in the community will play no small part.
Finally, there are outside investors who decide to opt for a “green field” situ-
ation. In other words, they will set up in competition with existing businesses 
on their own.
This is the very basis of the open market economy and usually results in 
winners and losers. The local business that has failed to explain its activities 
to its suppliers, customers, work force, bankers, and a whole host of other 
interested parties is likely to find a defense of its territory a lot more difficult 
than if it had won the confidence and respect of those people, before it faced 
competition.

Chapter 7 | Making Economic Reporting Relevant

A “Liquid” Example
I live in a small community some fifty miles south of London called Lewes. It 
has a brewery in the town, which was established in 1784. It has always been 
open with the local community, the local and regional media, and with other 
businesses.
A “LIQUID” LUNCH
There is an interesting divide between American and British journalists that is important 
to be aware of if you are a US reporter working in the UK or a British journalist operating 
in the United States. If there is alcohol served at a press conference, US journalists will 
usually stay away. If there is no alcohol at a press conference, then the Brits stay away. 
There is some substance to this notion, but of course, neither instance is set in stone! 
But the UK version is known as a “liquid” lunch (more booze than food).
The European beer industry has been subject to takeovers, amalgamations, 
and mergers. Yet this small brewery in Lewes has managed to fight off every 
big brewer that has tried to take it over. Because it has been so open and has 
won the community’s respect, beer drinkers are loyal to its brand of beer.
Competitors have tried to ban this beer from its bars to put the brewery out 
of business. But the exact opposite has happened. Loyal customers refuse to 
drink in bars where this beer is not served. So the competitor is the business 
that is suffering, not the local business itself.
This is a direct result of the brewery being open with the media, open with 
the customer, and open with its community.
It is also a by-product of good business reporting that accurately gave the facts 
about this business to a public dependent on it for jobs, community support, 
a thriving industry, and faith in the marketplace.
Business news is relevant to people, and business reporting is relevant to that 
relevance.
More Breadth and Depth
Readers and viewers need help in understanding how business affects them, 
and there is no better way than seeing business news simply but accurately 
explained on TV, radio, or in newspapers by trained reporters who know how 
to tell a story.

Business Journalism
65
So there is more breadth and depth required in business reporting than in  
general news to maintain a good level of understanding among an audience that 
increasingly demands to know what is happening with a country's economy.
Issues such as salaries, job security, interest on savings accounts, cost of living, 
and the price of goods or services are on the minds of a large section of the 
population.
Despite having straightforward labels, most of these issues can be very com-
plex, and it is the skilled business reporter who can ensure that readers and 
viewers understand clearly the issues involved.
Good coverage of business, financial, and economic issues is needed and that 
is a vital requirement of an open market society that journalism can provide.

Getting the 
Best from Press 
Conferences
Going to a press conference can either be a day off or some of the hardest 
work you will ever do.
Public relations (PR) departments don’t often discriminate between a story 
that is important to the press and a story that is important to their chairman. 
They should but they don’t, and it is sometimes difficult for an editor or TV 
assignment producer to determine how important the information presented 
at the conference will be from the words included in the invitation to attend.
If it’s not important, enjoy the free food and drink. If it is important, then make 
sure you get every fact and nugget of information that you can. Fight hard to 
get a one-on-one interview with the company executive who gave the pre-
sentation at the conference; and if any information is missing from your take 
on the story, get solid promises from the PR representative that this will be 
provided post conference.

  The relationship between PR practitioners and journalists is a fragile one. Often, PR 
people refer to journalists rather disparagingly as “hacks,” while the journalists are equally dismissive 
of PR people with the term “flacks.” But the fact is that one sector needs the other, and journalists 
could not provide comprehensive coverage of news if PR companies and departments didn’t exist.

The Benefits of Press Conferences
The most popular way of imparting information to media is through a press 
conference. It is an occasion in which a company can ensure that its message 
is directed towards journalists in a straightforward way while providing good 
background material at the same time in the form of information sheets, video 
news releases, photographs, press packs, and other important information. 
Mostly, it can be carried out in a convivial atmosphere with refreshments 
showered on the “hacks” who are there.
Much of the material handed out can be very useful to a journalist, and the 
direct contact with an authoritative spokesperson gives credibility to the 
story a “hack” intends to write.
The downside, as suggested previously, is that PR people often get the level 
of importance of a story wrong, reporters are left feeling their time has 
been wasted, and editors fret that they have committed human and technical 
resources that could have been better used elsewhere.
AVOID PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
Don’t let any preconceived ideas lessen your opinion about the usefulness of press 
conferences.
On one occasion in Northern Ireland, the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand 
(forerunner of PricewaterhouseCoopers) unveiled a document in which they analyzed 
the economy of the Province as if it were a listed company.
One reporter returned to base, telling the news editor it was just an attempt to soften up 
the media. The editor wanted to know later on in the day why the story was blazoned as 
a front page headline in the evening newspaper.
Prejudice cost that reporter a major story.
Business journalists rarely find press conferences useless. Most major 
companies, governments, civil services, chambers of commerce, and other 
business-oriented organizations usually use this form of press liaison to 
release facts, figures, important decisions, trade deals, and a variety of other 
financial and economic news to media.
It is rare that such information is trivial. But business journalists must be alert 
to the importance of the information and understand the background to it to 
make full use of the vehicle as a useful and reliable source.

Business Journalism
69
It is likely that business press conferences will include facts and figures about a 
company, the economy, or the financial well-being of an organization. Knowing 
how to interpret data (Chapter 19) is an essential skill for a business journalist.
The Role of Press Conferences
Press releases, press conferences, and one-on-one interviews are all standard 
procedures for a journalist to get information. But the press conference 
and the interview are always a battle of wits between the reporter and the  
disseminator of information.
Press conferences are typically held by a corporate public relations department, 
spokesperson’s office, or commercial public relations consultancy for a 
business, the government, or other organization. The aim of the press 
conference is not only to inform the press but also for the organization to 
control the way that information is made public.
In many cases, press conferences are a straightforward means of providing 
information to journalists and thereby the public. However, there have been 
many cases in which governments and businesses have issued press statements 
to try and obscure much more important information that is damaging to 
them. There are also instances of public relations personnel issuing statements 
that seem reasonably important but that hide the really hard story in the body 
of the text. Again, this is a way to conceal damaging information while enabling 
a government or business to deny that it withheld a story. In other words, the 
information was made available, but the press should have searched for it.
An example of this kind of skullduggery was the internal memo of a British 
government press officer who e-mailed colleagues, “It’s now a very good day 
to get out anything we want to bury.” The cynicism of this ploy caused media 
and public outrage as the day in question was September 11, 2001 (9/11), 
following the attacks on the World Trade Center.

  The journalist, especially the business journalist, must be on the lookout for tricks and 
dodges when considering information that is provided for them during press conferences.
What the Journalist Needs to Know Going In
The first decision in covering the news from a press release is for the journalist 
to determine whether the story is important enough for a press conference. 
Could it have been handed out in a press release? What is it about the story that 
makes it important enough for the organization to hold a formal press confer-
ence? As already noted, this is often a question that editors struggle to answer.

Chapter 8 | Getting the Best from Press Conferences
70
A common mistake among media managers is to call a press conference for 
relatively unimportant news. It is even more common for journalists to go to 
such press conferences, wasting precious time and resources. But if a press 
conference is called and a reporter attends it, the second thing he or she must 
remember is that the conference is biased in favor of the people holding it. 
The journalist who decides to report on the press conference must write any 
subsequent story without bias.
As a journalist, you may find that you are not on the invitation list to a press 
conference because you have been critical of a government minister, CEO, 
or a company. That is the risk that a reporter runs if stories are direct and  
honest. But that doesn’t mean you have to accept it. There are lots of other 
ways you can check out the story and get information you need to write 
a piece. For example, talk to trade unions in the case of a business, or the 
opposition in the case of government. Remember, if a government or busi-
ness tries to avoid critical journalists by not including them, the result can be  
uninformed comment and a hostile press: not a result they especially want.
Attending the Press Conference
After you arrive at the press conference, it’s important to look for any 
information packs. Ideally this should contain the speech to be made at the 
press conference, a background sheet on the organization, photographs, and 
biographical notes on the speaker. This material is often not made available; 
but where it is, it can be very useful in putting a story into context.
Next, establish if there is a space set aside for one-on-one interviews after 
the press conference. Observe the priority order set by the organization. TV 
and radio usually need to go first because of deadlines. Make sure you know 
the rules of the conference. How long is set aside for questions? Will there 
be chance for interviews afterward? Can a supplementary question be asked 
after the initial one?
Usually, just before the conclusion of the press conference, there will be a 
question-and-answer session for journalists to clarify any information or to 
ask additional questions. In doing so, the organizers will ask journalists to 
identify themselves and the publication or broadcaster they represent when 
asking a question. But if they don’t, do it that way anyway—and always stand 
up to ask your question.
Don’t be afraid to ask direct questions. Journalists have been invited to attend 
and therefore the organizers have demonstrated their willingness to be cross-
examined. But don’t be rude or aggressive: firm is quite sufficient. Watch out 
for the spokesperson who tries to brush off your question by suggesting it is 
silly or not worth consideration. This is an old trick and is usually a way of not 
answering a question they don’t want to answer. Insist on a reply.

Business Journalism
71
If the spokesperson honestly can’t immediately answer a question, insist that 
they supply the information requested as soon as they can. Follow up and 
make sure you get your answer later from the speaker or another staff mem-
ber from the organization giving the press conference.
Tip
■
■
  If for a good reason you can’t attend the conference, request a phone interview, or at the 
very least ask for the content to be sent to you either in press release or speech form. But don’t be 
offended if the organizers won’t provide material until after the press conference is over. It’s only fair 
they give priority to those who attended.
Finally, try not to let spokespersons close the conference before all reason-
able questions have been answered. Another favorite trick of organizers is 
to answer a couple of questions from “tame” journalists—that is, reporters 
sympathetic to the organization—then refuse to take other questions. They 
invited you, so there is no reason for you to accept such treatment.
If you happen to know the speaker, don’t let him or her patronize you into 
being soft on them. It’s the oldest trick in the world for a politician to walk 
into a room and speak a few words to reporters they know: “How’s your wife? 
Good to see you again.” It’s a trick. Don’t fall for it.
Do the job your editor has sent you to do.
A CASE OF PRESS CONFERENCE “TRICKS”
I was running a course for journalists in Armenia, where often young reporters are 
overawed by the fact that someone at a press conference is an important politician.
In this case, we had the minister of finance who had agreed to come to the course to 
be interviewed. In fact, the Ministry had made the rather silly comment previously that 
Armenia was totally unaffected by the financial crisis swirling around the rest of the 
world, so his presence was very pertinent to topical business stories.
I had warned the young journalists of the trick politicians use in “buttering them up” by 
picking on one or two of them to be familiar with and take the edge off any serious 
questions. And even if I had paid the guest to behave in that way, I couldn’t have persuaded 
him to give a better demonstration of what I had warned my fellow journalists about.
The minister of finance entered the room, immediately spotted a face he recognized, and 
stopped and had a “friendly chat” before taking his place at the head of table. There was 
a nervous giggle around the room as the journalists recognized the trick he was using.
It gave them confidence to start to ask searching questions about the country’s 
economy, and they began to perform in a way that was new and novel to them. And they 

Chapter 8 | Getting the Best from Press Conferences
72
got a good story from their endeavors because they managed to get an admission that 
overseas aid was likely to be reduced because of the financial crisis, thus putting the 
squeeze on the national budget.
At one point, the politician tried to divert attention by recalling a press trip he had 
had with one or two of the reporters. He failed to answer a question by diverting the 
conversation to the excellent lunch on the trip.
But by this time, the participants were alert to his ploy and, once they got their teeth in, 
didn’t let go. The result was a slightly chastened minister and a much more confident 
press corp.
After the Press Conference
If the speaker circulates after the formal press conference’s proceedings are 
over, watch out for denials in casual conversation. Nothing is ever “off the 
record” and “no comment” is unacceptable. Even if you are a text journalist, 
use a voice recorder to note all questions and answers. If you are challenged 
later for inaccurate reporting, it is a great safeguard.
Also, never tell the organizers what you are going to print or broadcast. This 
is your job, not theirs; and anyway, the best reporters will take time to think 
carefully about the angle they will choose.
Press Briefings
A press briefing is a different situation altogether. This is a way for organizations 
to chat with reporters about what the company or government department 
does and to provide the background for spot news, such as that emanating 
from a press conference. Briefings can be organized for a single journalist or 
for a group. Many reporters discount briefings because they take up nonpro-
ductive time. But they do put organizations and issues into context, so report-
age is more accurate and demonstrates a good understanding of the issues.
Briefings can provide much greater understanding about an organization so 
that reporters look and sound as if they know what they are talking about. 
Some journalists sniff at this sort of attention to detail. But never discount 
the intelligence of your readers or listeners. They can be very perceptive, and 
they know when a reporter is trying to cover the fact that he or she doesn’t 
really have much information about the story (or in fact doesn’t know much 
about the issue).
Time spent at briefings can help a reporter’s credibility and is time worth 
spending when an invitation to a briefing is received. People being questioned at 
a press conference sometimes complain what they say is “taken out of context” 
by reporters in any subsequent story. A press briefing gives the spokesperson 

Business Journalism
73
a chance to give that context. At the briefing, guidelines should be set as to 
what or what cannot be reported, but as a rule direct quotes from the event 
should not be used.
As seasoned reporters know, there are two sides to every story. No matter 
how plausible the argument is presented at either a press briefing or a press 
conference, good reporters will examine the information carefully. Knowledge 
of the subject is very helpful because if there are gaps in the information being 
provided or something “doesn’t sound right,” then it becomes obvious some 
checking needs to be done.

  References to “protocol journalism” are scattered throughout this book. Protocol 
journalism is the practice of reporting, verbatim, information supplied in press release form or at a 
press conference without questions being asked. Protocol journalism should be avoided.
Ask as many questions as are allowed at a press conference, but ask as many 
if necessary after you get back to base to write the story. If it’s a trade story, 
what do unions have to say? If the news is from a government, what do 
opposition politicians have to say? If it is an economic story, how does this fit 
in with an analyst’s point of view? Keep on asking people on “the other side” 
of the story until you are satisfied that your news item is correct.
And don’t let company officials off the hook. If they promised you to get 
additional information that was not available at the time of the conference, 
press them for it. Being a “terrier” is all part of being a journalist; being a 
bulldog gives that extra “bite” to a business journalist.
Key Points

conference.
Don’t let speakers or company executives patronize you

into not asking tough questions.
Don’t take “off the record” comments or accept “no

Television 
Reporting Skills
I teach and train journalists from a wide variety of different overseas 
locations and, in the process, I learn a great deal about conditions in their 
own countries.
For example, Internet penetration is not extensive in many emerging econo-
mies, which is especially true of nations in Africa with large rural areas, such 
as Nigeria, with almost 170 million people scattered over a vast landscape. In 
Nigeria, 28 percent of the population uses the Internet. Bucking the world 
trend, newspaper circulation in Nigeria has increased substantially in a decade 
to 25 percent. But television coverage is more than 80 percent.
Information dissemination in many other emerging democracies throughout 
the developing world reflects a similar picture. Television is still an important 
means of getting news and information.
Nor should the Western world think that TV is becoming less important in 
developed nations because of the inroads being made by the Internet. TV pro-
ducers, journalists, and broadcasters are “content” providers. Whether the 
audience chooses to watch on a conventional television service, a computer, 
iPad, or phone, the basic product is television.
The Visual Nature of Television
Television is a visual medium. Reporters must always give priority to the  
pictures, a skill known as “writing to pictures.” The script should not say what 
is obvious. If the pictures show workers walking down the street chanting  
slogans, for example, it’s both repetitive and foolish to say, “Strikers walked 
down the streets chanting slogans.”
9
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 9 | Television Reporting Skills

Instead, the words a journalist uses should give information not evident in 
the pictures. Continuing the same example, the reporter might say, “Five 
hundred people took part in a demonstration protesting redundancies at  
the car factory. This is the sixth consecutive day that workers have taken to 
the streets.”
When reporting for television, detail should be kept to a minimum. Don’t 
overwrite, and let the pictures breathe. This is especially important if there is 
some good natural sound on the tape: for example, the clanging of the bell at 
the New York Stock Exchange. Don’t drown out the good natural sound with 
an endless commentary, and take pauses while reading.
Finally, as with any form of news writing, television reporters should write in 
short, simple sentences, avoiding long titles of people or organizations, which 
can be put on the screen as captions.

  As with any reporting, give your viewer some credit. Never underestimate the intelligence of 
the audience. But never overestimate their knowledge either.
Keys to Successful Interviewing
Before doing an interview it is very important to research the subject thor-
oughly and, if you are able, to choose an interviewee carefully. Look for an 
interviewee who can speak clearly, concisely, and with authority.
An interview should be to the point; it should not be long and rambling, 
particularly for news items. The journalist should always be in control. The 
reporter decides how the room will be set up, decides where the interviewee 
will sit or stand, and, most importantly, determines the agenda of the interview 
and the questions.
LOSING CONTROL OF THE INTERVIEW
A very experienced and famous American interviewer Barbara Walters lost her focus on 
one occasion while interviewing actress Katherine Hepburn. Letting her mind wander 
and failing to concentrate on the interview, she asked Hepburn what kind of tree she 
would like to be. Hepburn answered she hoped she was not an elm, with Dutch elm 
disease. Walters admitted later that she was in a pickle with the interview but with good 
humor said that she, as the interviewer, “couldn’t get out from under the branches.” 
Nonetheless, it was far from professional.

Business Journalism
77
There is only one important question in any interview and that’s the first one. 
Thereafter, an interviewer must listen to the answer carefully before posing the 
next question.
It is always painfully obvious when an interviewer is reading prepared questions 
and downright silly when they get an answer to which their next question 
makes no sense.
              “Did you enjoy yourself last evening?”
              “No.”
              “So which part did you especially enjoy?” Great interviewing!
Also, do not give an interviewee the exact questions in advance. You may 
perhaps tell them the first question in detail, followed by the general areas 
you want to cover. But if they know precisely what you intend to ask, they will 
rehearse the answers in their heads and their replies may sound stilted and 
“false” on camera, possibly even wrecking the credibility of your story.
Setting Up the Shot
Even if you only have five minutes available, thinking through a shoot and plan-
ning it is important. Don’t assume that the cameraperson will cover every 
eventuality and remember everything for you. Work as a team.
Here are several key points to remember:
Remind the camera crew to use a tripod if you need one, 
• 
and to check on batteries, lights, and so on.
Think about what setup shots you will need to establish 
• 
the story.
Once inside the building, look at the layout of the room 
• 
and see where it is best to put the camera.
At press conferences always get cutaways of other people 
• 
reacting to the speaker.
If possible try to influence how the shoot will take place, 
• 
where the interviewee will sit, whether he or she is 
looking camera left or camera right, and so on.
Listen for extraneous noise. Ask for radios, telephones, 
• 
and so on to be shut off if they are likely to interrupt 
the interview.
In single interviews, always try to get extra shots that can be used as cutaways 
or illustration: for example, a picture on the desk or the interviewee’s hands.

Chapter 9 | Television Reporting Skills

  Plan for the expected … so you can cope with the unexpected.
When the viewer sees an interview, it often looks as if there were a number 
of cameras recording the event. But two-camera shoots are rare. A reporter 
usually has to make do with a single camera.
To make sure that the report moves along in sequence, a few actions are 
required to give that impression. The camera needs to be moved so that 
the interviewer can be seen asking questions of the interviewee. A couple of  
“two shots” help the look of the event—that is, when interviewer and inter-
viewee are both seen in the shot.
This means the person being interviewed has to wait around for a few  
minutes after the camera has ceased recording the actual interview. Most 
business leaders and politicians are quite used to this and readily stay for 
those few extra minutes. If someone is in a bit of a rush or not used to being 
interviewed for TV, it’s still possible to make the “package” look attractive. 
Generally, though, if the requirement is patiently explained, most interviewees 
will stay behind.
The reporter and camera crew must work on a few extra items immediately 
after the interview:
For reverses/cutaways/
• 
noddies (those silly moments when 
the interviewer nods blankly at the camera), keep the 
camera close to the interviewee.
For mute noddies, the reporter must look interested,  
• 
perhaps nodding his/her head slightly (but not too much).
If time is short, the reporter can move into the chair or 
• 
position previously occupied by the interviewee; but the 
reporter must make sure that he or she is looking in the 
opposite direction to the guest and that the background 
is different.
Remember the risk of “crossing the line.” The camera 
• 
must stay on the same “side” as it was when facing the 
interviewee after being moved to record questions from 
the reporter. Otherwise, the two people will end up look-
ing away from one another rather than at one another.
If you have two cameras, you should cross-shoot, remem-
• 
bering not to “cross the line,” so the camera posi-
tions need to be on the same side of the reporter and 
interviewee.

Business Journalism
79
Try to match the shots so you have similarly sized shots 
• 
to cut together.
Be careful of objects on the set. The same thing should 
• 
not be included in the shot of the interviewee and then in 
a reverse as they will appear to “jump” across the room.
Even the most seasoned reporters sometimes forget 
• 
they have a microphone attached to them. Be careful you 
make no comments you really should keep to yourself. 
The world may hear them. As microphones are some-
times attached to the camera, the cord will either stran-
gle you as you move away, or more likely you will bring all 
the technical gear crashing down.
All of this activity is known as the “shoot,” whether it is done inside a building 
or outside in the open air. The shoot provides the skeleton of the item to be 
broadcast, and it is now the responsibility of the reporter, sometimes with the 
aid of a video editor, to flesh out the item to make it a proper picture story 
and an attractive news presentation.
Then, back at base, the reporter has to begin a new sequence of events to 
produce a complete and polished video story.
Writing and Recording the Story
Introductions are normally written by the journalist who has worked on the 
story and then adapted by the presenter. Writers must ask
Is the introduction clear and easy to follow?
• 
Does the introduction tease the viewers, leaving them 
• 
with an urge to watch the report?
Will the viewer understand the content?
• 
Does it contain irrelevant rubbish?
• 
Is the story told up front or has it been buried in the 
• 
report?
Once the report is written, check that
you can read it easily when recording
• 
the viewer will understand it
• 
you covered the key elements of the story
• 

Chapter 9 | Television Reporting Skills
80
And once the report has been recorded, check the following:
Did you fluff your words? Should you record it again?
• 
Did you read the story at a pace that the viewer could 
• 
understand?
Did you read the story with authority?
• 
Were you just “reading” the words—or communicating 
• 
them to the viewer?
Did you sound bored?
• 
Sound recording tends to flatten the human voice, so it is often a good idea to 
put a little more emphasis into your voice. When recording a “light” or funny 
story, for example, you should hear a smile in the voice.
Note

■
  Each writer will have a distinctive style; even so, a television journalist will have to adjust 
to the “house” style of the broadcaster. Most news organizations will have a house style guide so that 
journalists know both the writing and picture editing (cutting) style that is expected from the day they 
are employed. There is nothing more irritating for a viewer than to have news bulletins and business 
reports looking, sounding, and feeling different from day to day or hour to hour.
Editing the Interview
Reporters should not write a script for a complicated item or story and then 
simply plaster pictures over it to fit. This practice is one of the major causes 
of boring reports.
Before starting to edit (cut) the video, reporters need to assemble on paper 
a short cutting script based loosely on what they know they want to say; 
which bits of the interviews are to be used, and a list of pictures that could be 
used to cover the points. This is the responsibility of reporters, but in most 
organizations, a video editor will assist in the process. These video editors 
are fondly known as “cutters” because, before videotape, part of the process 
involved actually cutting pieces of film and sticking them together. The name 
remained as part of TV folklore.
Modern journalists can and often do edit their story without technical help 
because computer software is available for them to do it. This is much more 
efficient, but I always valued the input of a video editor who saw the interview 
from a different perspective and could add valuable suggestions on making the 
edit attractive.

Business Journalism
81
Usually, reporters write a draft script before starting the edit process. This 
gives them a chance to find suitable pictures. But as the story/interview is 
being cut, keep adjusting the script to help fit the available pictures and vice 
versa. When—but only when—you are satisfied that it all works and makes 
sense, you can record the commentary.
Note
■
■
  There are, of course, many more skills to master, such as writing a script to exact time—
three words per second is the rule of thumb—and building a sequence of shots to demonstrate an 
action. Such a sequence may be illustrated by the example of filming a golf player. The sequence 
would see a long shot of the golfer, a closer shot of his hands gripping the club and a shot of the 
backward swing, and a view of the ball on the tee before going back to seeing the ball shooting off 
down the fairway. If the basic tips outlined earlier in this chapter are followed, the rest will come as a 
journalist gains in experience.
The Making of a News Program
I have mentioned that I was the London anchor of the American daily, coast-
to-coast, business program on PBS, Morning Business Report. My co-anchor in 
the United States was the very beautiful and very accomplished TV business 
journalist, Melissa Conti.
To make a TV program appealing, the presenters must “spark” off each other. 
There must be a mutual charisma, an appearance of liking each other, trust-
ing each other, and admiring each other’s professional abilities. This I enjoyed 
with Melissa and each morning, while waiting to go on the air, I would bounce 
up and down on the balls of my feet and create a huge beam on my face to 
try and match Melissa’s bubbly personality. It worked well, and each morning  
I would open up the link with a very hearty, “Good Morning, Melissa!”
Our “set” was an open plan. The camera was located in the middle of the 
Reuters newsroom so the viewer could see Reuters’ journalists working away 
in the background. It worked very well.
FUN IN THE NEWSROOM
One morning, the entire Reuters work force combined to play a prank on both of us.
As I said in front of the camera, “Good morning, Melissa!” the entire newsroom rose to 
its feet and echoed in chorus, “Good morning, MelissaI” It brought the house down, and 
it was a morning to remember because trying to broadcast serious business news after 
that was a tall order.

Chapter 9 | Television Reporting Skills
82
But this was an American program, and while the London anchor made impor-
tant contributions, the guts of the news was generated in the United States.
To help readers understand how a program of this sort works, I asked Melissa 
if she would write the following brief description of Morning Business Report.
The Making of Morning Business Report
By Melissa Conti Winton
Beating the Billionaire
From 1979 to 2013, Nightly Business Report (NBR) was a dominant force in 
TV business news, airing on public stations throughout the United States. 
Produced at WPBT-TV, Channel 2, in Miami, Florida, NBR was the first in the 
nation to focus solely on news of the business and financial world. But in the 
early 1990s, financial information mogul Michael Bloomberg wanted to snatch 
that domination with the introduction of a short 15-minute morning business 
newscast.
The program with a talking anchor head, busy graphics, and lines of news 
scrawling at the bottom of the scene revolutionized the way TV business news 
was presented and it shook up the producers of NBR, who were already busy 
fighting off cable business news giant CNBC. Not only did Bloomberg’s new 
program air on his financial terminals located in every major financial and 
brokerage house in the United States, it also started airing on various public 
television stations nationwide.
NBR saw this as a direct attack in their backyard and quickly created a new 
morning business news program to compete against the mogul turned mayor.
The KISS Staff
Without much funding and time, NBR chiefs brought the KISS journalism prin-
ciple (Keep It Short and Simple) to a whole new level. With the purchase 
of a brand new nonlinear computer editing system, they were able to pull 
together a national television program with a very short staff of six: an anchor, 
who was also the producer and writer (and makeup artist and hairstylist); a 
director, who was also the technical director; an associate producer, who was 
also graphics producer (and general therapist to the anchor in times of high 
stress); a cameraman, who was also the editor and floor director; and two 
correspondents, one from Japan and the other from London. In 1994, Morning 
Business Report (MBR) was born and immediately sent to the frontlines in the 
fight for business news eyeballs. I was appointed the General.

Early to Rise (Very Early)
At first, it was flattering to be given the titles of anchor, producer, and writer 
(and supervisor) of a new morning business news show. But as anyone who’s 
ever worked on morning television will tell you, those jobs come with a big 
price—the price of normal sleep. Even though we aired at 6 A.M. Monday 
through Friday, the MBR staff had to report to work at 2 A.M. because there 
was much to be done before I said “Good morning, I’m Melissa Conti” to 
public television viewers across the country.
Rising at 1:00 A.M. to get to work by 2 A.M. was exciting at first, given the nov-
elty of the job, but as time wore on, it became clear to me that humans were 
definitely not meant to be nocturnal creatures. Regardless of the amount of 
sleep I was able to get during the day, I was perpetually tired and required 
increasing amounts of caffeine. After 9 years, I still wake up at 1 A.M.
Taking the Lead
My main goal when I walked in the station door at 2 A.M. was to make MBR 
as fresh as possible—to deliver the latest business and financial news and to 
explain to our target audience how that news might impact their investments 
and businesses. I sat down at my desk (wrapped my hair in curlers) and culled 
the Associated Press newswires and newspapers, namely, the Wall Street Journal 
and the New York Times, for the latest and greatest news and, at the same time, 
watched the early, early morning newscasts (as well as a bit of sumo wrestling 
on Japanese TV). I spent much time contemplating the lead story, which usually 
ended up to be about a major corporate merger or acquisition, a corporate 
bankruptcy, a major world event that would impact world financial markets, 
or, some days, all three.
Once I decided on the lead story, I ordered relevant video from the editor 
(who was usually sleeping in the back editing bay). I grabbed my Rolodex (for 
the young people reading this, we used to write phone numbers on paper 
cards attached to a round apparatus) and located a financial analyst who 
would comment live by phone on how the news in the lead story would 
impact financial markets.
World News from Japan and a British Bloke
Also enlisted in the battle for business viewers were two other television 
anchors from Reuters TV—Lucy Craft in Tokyo and Keith Hayes from London. 
Lucy’s intense, get-to-the-point style of reporting was in sharp contrast to 
Keith’s always jovial (except during tragic events) news delivery. Their task 
was to inform our viewers of the latest business and financial news in those 
areas of the world, including how their financial markets were trading, in light 
of their potential influence on Wall Street.

84
Their reports, usually five to seven minutes in length, were fed via satellite 
to our editor before MBR aired. Our skeleton crew and matching budget 
prevented us from going live with those reports at 6 A.M. Of course, today, 
with the advent of the Internet, budget and crew size would no longer be 
such an obstacle.
Numbers News
Another major component to our business and financial newscast was  
numbers. Reports released by the US government such as unemployment, 
housing, and inflation, as well as corporate earnings reports, had the potential 
to rally or repress Wall Street, so I made sure to include a segment on the 
reports expected that day and the often times unrealistic expectations of 
financial analysts. The numbers news was presented in a package by one of 
the NBR correspondents based in New York reading the upcoming numbers 
right to camera with graphics.
The Rundown
Once I decided on and assembled all the components in consultation with 
the director, associate producer, editor, and the overseas folks, it was time to  
populate the rundown. The almighty rundown is a TV tool that keeps every-
thing that goes on air, be it news or entertainment, organized and within a 
certain time frame. It is essentially a list of items with a running time tally. 
Much like a puzzle, each piece of a newscast has to fit exactly into a certain 
time frame (and I mean down to the second, exactly).
Without the rundown, TV producers and directors would have no idea what 
comes first, next, or last and when to bring the anchor on camera, roll pack-
aged reporter stories, video, graphics, and advertising (or underwriting, as we 
call it in the public television realm). The following is a sample of the MBR 
rundown with its running time tally in minutes and seconds. MBR was exactly 
15 minutes in length.

And in 3, 2 …
Once the rundown was complete, I sent it off to the director, associate pro-
ducer, and editor/camera guy. If there were no objections (and there usually 
weren’t since I had a great crew that was able to perform the impossible every 
single day), I rushed off to the makeup room to perform the impossible—
looking happy and awake at 6 A.M. in the morning. Because we had no money 
in the budget for a makeup artist and no makeup artists wanted to work for 
free at 5 A.M., I did my own.
By 5:30 A.M. (most days), I was ready and headed to the studio to make 
sure all was on track with the crew. I checked my microphone and IFB  
(a special earpiece that enabled me to hear the director) to make sure they 
were working. The editor/cameraman/lighting guy/floor manager checked all 
the equipment in studio. I checked the teleprompter, which I ran myself, and 
read through some of the scripts. I also checked the computer on the set to 
make sure there was no breaking news on the newswires, and finally, it was 
showtime. The director cued me “in 3, 2, 1” and MBR was on the air live at 
6:00 A.M. Eastern time. (Public television stations had the option to air the 
show live or wait for other shows, which were fed continuously by satellite.) 
As the show was rolling live, I would often check the wires during reporter 
packages and interviews; and when breaking news occurred, I made the  
decision to roll the show again live at 6:15 A.M. through 6:30 A.M. The show 
was re-fed continuously until 8:00 A.M. Following a one-hour break, I would 
freshen the news and we went live again at 9:00 A.M. for stations on the  
West Coast.

  In 2001, the attacks on 9/11 left the country and the world shaken and sped up the 
erosion of the US economy and the eventual end of Morning Business Report. In 2002, computer 
giant Hewlett Packard ended its underwriting contract for NBR, thus stripping the morning show of 
the little budget it had. In October of 2002, the staff was informed that MBR would be cancelled at 
the end of the year.
Key Points
Write your script to the pictures. Don’t make the script 
• 
ape what the pictures are showing.
Check your voice-over. Be careful to avoid fluffs and mis-
• 
takes and re-record if necessary.
The most important question in an interview is the first 
• 
one. All other questions and answers should follow on 
from that.
Choose your pictures carefully. Poor selection makes a 
• 
story boring and difficult to watch.

Reporting  
on Business for 
Television
There is a tendency to think of business reporting on TV as somehow separate 
and different from “ordinary” news reporting.
In the main this is simply not true. Just because channels like Bloomberg, 
and programs like BBC World News’ “World Business Report” or those in 
CNBC’s “World” global business news network have a distinctive style does 
not mean that they produce these programs—or individual reports within 
them—with different skills compared to straight news journalism.
The role of business television journalism needs to focus on how the jour-
nalist should gear his or her approach to the specific medium of television 
and electronic broadcasting. But before I get into that, let’s talk about who 
watches business television.
Business Television Viewership
There are two distinct primary audiences of people who watch business  
programs. One is the upwardly mobile executive who has spare cash and 
wants to increase his or her capital. The other is the professional banker,  
broker, analyst, or economist. A secondary audience is the businesspeople 
who want to stay abreast of what is happening in their sector or what their 
competitors are up to. These primary and secondary audiences are consid-
ered to be “professional” viewers.
10
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 10 | Reporting on Business for Television 
88
The main business television channels of the early “noughties,” or 2000s, found 
a correlation in audience figures to the state of the economy. In the boom 
years of that decade, audiences soared. Because of an increase in personal 
income, younger people who worked in certain professions (such as lawyers, 
doctors, and architects) and who had never previously invested in stocks used 
extra funds to buy shares. These young professionals avidly watched markets 
and share prices and investment opportunities on television to increase their 
portfolios. Even more so, surveys found, they got a happy feeling from watch-
ing business news that reported their shareholdings prospering and their bank 
balances bulging.
Conversely, when economies contracted, the same professionals didn’t want 
to hear that their shares were losing value and their assets were shrinking. 
So they stopped watching. Business journalists can’t do much about that, 
but it is important to be aware that the business television viewing habits 
of individual amateur investors, especially those with modest shareholdings, 
are driven by the state of the economy. So viewership rises and falls in line 
with global economic fluctuations.
The professional viewer is quite different from the young professional or  
individual viewer. Brokers and dealers have TV sets at their desks (or at least 
on their computer screens) and watch avidly as anchors report the latest fluc-
tuations in the financial markets. After all, business news is their business.
For the professional financial executives, TV business reporters must make 
sure that business television “adds value.” These people who need the numbers 
(market movements, stock prices, and so forth) usually have this information 
at their desks. What they want from TV is comment and analysis. So the 
importance of guests in business television can’t be understated.
TV business reporters can achieve a different dimension by focusing on the 
main things individuals, both professional financial people and small investors, 
want to know from a business story—which is primarily, “How do I make 
money out of this?”
Business Television: A Common Vision
Above all, journalists and producers need to be very astute about the type of 
guests they manage to persuade to appear on their shows.
Broadcasters, TV stations, and TV news operations differ both within coun-
tries and from country to country. But there is one thing they all have in com-
mon, and on which they all agree—the staff must all be aiming for the same 
thing and have a common set of editorial and visual standards to which they 
work.

Business Journalism
89
In other words, the entire news staff—journalists, presenters, producers, 
reporters, subeditors, researchers, camera people, editors, sound people, 
graphics people, and so forth—must all share a common goal and, more 
importantly, they must all work to an agreed house “style”—a way of shoot-
ing, editing (cutting), writing, and so forth that is consistent across all news 
bulletins, day to day, week to week. This applies across all genres—business 
reporting, general news, and investigative and specialist reporting.
But each station, each program must create an identity so that viewers know 
without seeing the station logo that they are watching the program that  
provides them with the best information.
Obviously the choice of style and how an individual report—or even a whole 
program—looks will vary from station to station and is often dictated by what 
kind of audience (for example, what age group) the broadcaster is aiming at.
Note

■
  In this chapter, I don’t try and set out a style to be adopted but rather a few guidelines and 
rules that are the commonly accepted minimum standards to which any serious news (or business) 
reporter should aspire.
Writing Stories for Television
Business reporting on television should be seen as an “extra dimension.” To 
attract a viewer, the basic rules guiding competent television reporting need to 
be stringently observed by a business reporter. Best television practice should 
be the cornerstone on which the specific of business reporting is built.
As noted in the previous chapter, television is a visual medium. It may 
seem obvious, but it’s often forgotten, particularly by people who move 
to television from print or radio. Reporters should always give priority to 
the pictures. Writing for business television needs to be supplemented by 
excellent graphics and technical wizardry, and the story running orders 
need extra special consideration.
Knowledge of business, economics, finance, and trade is essential to good 
business news reporting. In the early days of coming to grips with TV and 
some of its complications, such as creating a picture story and coloring the 
presentation with moving graphs and pie charts, non-broadcast journalists 
found it all too easy to forget the basics of journalism generally and basic TV 
journalism in particular.
It is therefore incumbent on any TV business journalist to approach the task 
of reporting on television by applying the basics religiously.

Chapter 10 | Reporting on Business for Television 
90
Don’t abandon the basics of journalism. ALL stories should include what 
is sometimes called “5-W-H”—that is, What, Where, When, Who, Why, 
and How.
To elaborate
What is happening?
• 
Where is it happening?
• 
When did it happen?
• 
Who is involved?
• 
Why is it happening?
• 
How has it come about?
• 
ALL news stories should answer ALL these questions. Television news is no 
exception.
News has been described as “the first rough draft of history” and “the  
immediate, the important, the things that have an impact on our lives.” This 
applies as much to business reporting as to “hard” news.
HARD VERSUS SOFT NEWS
News is generally categorized as being hard or soft. This too applies to business news.
Hard news provides stories about events that have just happened or are about to 
happen. They are reported as an account of what happened, why it happened, and how 
the viewers are affected.
Soft news produces stories that are intended to entertain or inform. There is often an 
emphasis on human interest or a novelty factor. They may focus on people, places, or 
issues that affect the viewers’ lives: for example, a new invention that the inventor hopes 
will make him or her a millionaire.
LONG-FORM BUSINESS PROGRAMS
We tend to think of business news in terms of short news items, but there is no reason 
that business cannot (and in fact does) feature in long-form current affairs programs or 
documentaries.
Even areas such as sports can be seen through “business” eyes. A London-based 
production company made a regular half-hour program called “The Business of Sport,” 
which contained nothing but reports about the business side of sports. It was shown in 
dozens of countries around the globe.

Business Journalists Must Take Extra Care 
When Broadcasting
Business television news has a greater responsibility than regular news when 
it comes to credibility. People’s money is at stake—tax money, wages, pen-
sions, and a whole lot more. As a consequence, reporters should resist giving 
their own opinions in their news package but rely on experts. Therefore, 
having contacts among a whole range of experts who are willing to be inter-
viewed is paramount.
And as such, it is usually necessary to have at least one video clip (sound bite) 
of an expert or interviewee in any business news package, sometimes two. 
The independent expert is vital to the credibility of business news items.
Where the audience is a specific one, such as bankers, businesspeople, traders, 
and so forth, television provides comment and analysis. This will be especially 
true as economies move from transitional to mature open markets.
It is best to get analysts and experts on camera or live in the studio; but where 
this is not possible, then the use of telephone interviews is completely accept-
able, showing a photo of the expert or his place of work on screen.
If instead the audience is the ordinary man in the street, make sure there is 
plentiful use of graphics, charts, and tables. In this age of sophisticated graphic 
art, the graphics can move and jump and add to the overall compilation of an 
interesting and watchable piece of television. There are now “swipe screens” 
available where with one brush of the hand, pictures or graphics or text can 
be swiped onto or off an in-studio screen.
Be extra careful about “strap line” identification of any pictures of people you 
use. The Queen of England will not be amused if she is identified as First Lady 
Michelle Obama or vice versa.
A junior desk reporter will probably be given the task of writing brief head-
lines on any moving “ticker” that appears beneath the news program. Business 
journalists should check these ticker stories carefully. The slightest mistake 
(and because they are often written in a hurry, there are many) can have seri-
ous consequences if allowed to run unchanged.

Chapter 10 | Reporting on Business for Television 
92
TICKERS: GOOD OR BAD?
There is a sharp division between journalists over the use of tickers. Most business 
journalists approve of their use, especially for things such as market closing prices 
and foreign exchange rates. But many reporters believe they can be overused, so they 
clutter up the screen, making viewing a single story or even an entire business program 
difficult. The opposite argument is that such information is demanded by the professional 
viewer who wants detailed financial and economic data on his trading screen 24 hours 
a day.
Finally, when doing a piece to camera, try to make your sign-off as pertinent as 
possible to the story while putting a little action into the piece.
On one occasion I was reporting on a European potato shortage. During the 
piece, which was reported in Britain but targeted for an American audience, 
I made a slightly amusing comparison between the difference in meaning of 
some English words with their American counterparts such as cookie for  
biscuit, biscuit for scone, and crisp for chips.
In my piece to camera, I ate some french fries, called chips in the UK, while 
summing up my story. I reported on the fact that the staple English diet of 
fish and chips would become very expensive if the potato shortage lasted and 
at this point ate a “french fry,” saying “So the staple diet of chips, excuse me, 
french fries, may disappear from UK menus.”
Fairly simple “drama,” but that clip is used by colleagues even today in train-
ing courses to demonstrate how to make a serious business story attractive 
and amusing.
Working as a Team
Sometimes it is necessary to do quick-fire reporting on the “hoof,” such as the 
UK finance minister (known as “The Chancellor of the Exchequer”) unveiling 
his annual budget to the House of Commons. No one but the senior mem-
bers of government knows what the budget contains, so reporters have to 
pick the important points from the speech as it is being given.
This is where teamwork comes in, and for important business and economic 
information such as this, journalists should work in a team. It might be a team 
from your own TV station or it might be competing reporters from other 
media. I have often been in a press room when this sort of situation prevails, 
and to ensure that serious mistakes aren’t made, I have worked closely with 
“competitors” to ensure my reportage was correct.

Business Journalism
93
Television journalists should work closely with the producer, director, and 
technical personnel on a business news show. Working in cooperation on 
business journalism with colleagues and competitors is vital to successful 
reportage. Accuracy and the audience come first. Competition can some-
times take a back seat in the interests of the viewer.
Producing Successful Business Documentaries
There is an obvious difference between reporting “hard” business news and 
soft news and yet again between story reporting and documentaries.
Graham Addicott worked for many years as a business reporter for the 
London weekday TV company Thames Television. He then set up his own 
award winning and very successful documentary production company First 
Freedom.
Here, Addicott explains the philosophy about making business documentary 
programs from the background of having produced more than 50 acclaimed 
programs over a decade (and he is still doing so).
Addicott says that the secret to making an entertaining business documentary 
for mainstream television is to try and make it look as little about business 
as possible. “By which I don’t mean that it can’t be serious, or tackle a serious 
subject,” he says. “But it should try to avoid duplicating the coverage done by 
normal business programmes, and channels like Bloomberg and CNBC.”
An example follows: news might cover the World Islamic Economic Forum 
(WIEF) by concentrating on the speakers of the day, and current affairs cover-
age might take one of the debates and flesh out the subject. But a documen-
tary has to try and find a different angle—following a delegate from his or her 
home country perhaps, or taking a look at the Halal Industry and weaving in 
any WIEF debates there might be as background to the main story line.
The business documentary should try to appeal to as wide an audience as 
possible but at the same time recognize that audiences differ from broad-
caster to broadcaster (a documentary or series will be very different in tone 
and content on BBC World News to one on the Discovery Channel). So it 
is important when thinking of a subject to tackle, and of how to tackle it, to 
think of the audience: and also of the style of the broadcaster you will be mak-
ing the program for—“There is no point trying to sell red shoes to someone 
determined to buy green ones.”
All stories have a beginning, middle and end; but in the case of documentaries, 
the opening and closing sequences are perhaps the most important part of 
the whole program—these are the sequences that most people will remem-
ber, so they should be both visually and editorially strong. “Tell them you are 
going to tell them, tell them, and then tell them you have told them” is not a 
bad structure for a documentary.

Chapter 10 | Reporting on Business for Television 
94
Note

■
  The great advantage documentaries have over typical business news stories is time—
time to construct arguments using the interviewees, time to allow pictures to “breathe,” time to let 
the pictures and the interviewees tell the tale, and time for the audience to mull over what they 
are watching.
To that end shooting and editing has to be much more considered—it is 
not enough to write a script and just put wallpaper pictures over words 
and interviews. Everything about the documentary—pictures, commentary, 
and interviewees—has to blend into a whole. Planning is vital, as are recon-
noitering locations, people, and picture shots (known as recces) for a docu-
mentary program.
Reporting on Business for Television
It is not boring to repeat the adage that Addicott used in explaining how to 
approach a business documentary; so read yet again: “Tell them you are going 
to tell them, tell them, and then tell them you have told them.”
So here goes with a reminder about the key elements of reporting on busi-
ness for television. And be sure to remember how the television journalist 
should gear his or her approach to the specific medium of television and 
electronic broadcasting.
Every business and financial reporter working in television must ask the vital 
questions “Why do people watch it?”and “What can it achieve?” The main 
thing people want to know from a business story is “How do I make money 
out of this?” So it is important that a reporter makes business television sto-
ries that offer “added value”; the professional audiences have the numbers, so 
they want comment and expert analysis; and the importance of guests in busi-
ness television mustn’t be underestimated. The good reporter will remember 
that a story is a story is a story; use the basics, of “who, what, where, when, 
why, and how,” in making difficult and complex financial stories simple; and 
remember how to determine and address your audience.
Constantly examine the detail of what business television needs to communi-
cate to a general public and determine the differences in approach for a busi-
ness or economic audience: using commentators to back up the stories and 
where to get qualified people; the use of telephone interviews, the importance 
of asking the right questions; and understanding that views and sentiment drive 
markets and how that impacts on sources of guests and/or sources of news.
Remember that writing for business television isn’t boring, so it’s important 
to understand how to properly write and structure a business television 
story; keep in mind your colleagues needs and accept the importance of the 

Business Journalism
95
­introduction you must write for an anchor; and learn how to write a news 
package “off the intro” using a “grab (sound bite)” with a package and ascer-
tain whether a story needs a guest.
Practice how to deal with structuring a news package on paper using inter-
views shot earlier, establishing what pictures are required and where they will 
come from, deciding how best to illustrate the story, and the importance of 
graphics and deciding if the story needs a graphic.
Nothing is set in stone: “The Golden Rule of Journalism is that there is no 
Golden Rule.” Sounds familiar doesn’t it? It is important that you make posi-
tive decisions but not be afraid of changing your mind.
Think carefully about how to assemble running orders, deciding if the inter-
view should go live, and understanding why journalists talking to journalists on 
air doesn’t usually work unless you are establishing a presence.
Many times you will have to deliver under pressure and be prepared if the 
program hits problems. Remember it is important to look after your guests, 
briefing presenters and handling breaking news. In other words, the good busi-
ness journalist will be prepared to react to any given situation.
A VALUABLE LESSON
I remember when I first started in commercial radio. I was the cub, the newcomer, the 
neophyte.
I was completing the assembly of the 17:30 news bulletin one evening and feeling very 
cocky and proud at the job I had done when the senior shift journalist asked who had 
taken the wire copy from the shelf.
I confidently piped up that I had. He snatched the paper from my hand and growled that 
no one touched that except the senior who would read the 18:00 major bulletin.
I had 30 seconds to find some replacement news, so in desperation, I grabbed the first 
pieces of wire copy that I could. I then spent 5 minutes reading a news bulletin that 
consisted of a vivid description of the mating habits of the buffalo in Northern Manitoba. 
I can remember the sweat drops beginning to trickle down my nose the more I read of 
this enthralling story.
But the moral is I managed to do the newscast despite a very difficult situation, and I 
learned a valuable lesson on newsroom procedure the hard way!

Chapter 10 | Reporting on Business for Television

A Bright Future for Television News
It might be a strange thing for a journalist to say that peace has been the driver 
of business news, when the very essence of a news story is based on conflict. 
But the cessation of global military conflict over almost three quarters of a 
century, and the collapse of many authoritarian governments, has made busi-
ness reporting increasingly important.
Large numbers of countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa have started to develop 
open market economies. World trade is booming, despite the setbacks of 
occasional economic recession. Domestically, populations have seen wealth 
and living standards increasing; and more people have taken an interest in 
wealth-creating investments such as stocks and bonds.
All this has caused a steady shift of news emphasis in all media from death and 
destruction to reportage of business and economic news.
With the technological advances in communications such as Internet, satel-
lites, micro TV cameras, and 24-hour news channels, TV business reporting 
has boomed and continues to do so.
The growth in business and economic news media has been strong and looks 
as if it will continue to be so. These are exciting times for reporters in the 
journalistic profession to become business reporters. In an industry that is 
hiring less staff, the number of business news reporters is on the increase; and 
with the exciting advances in the medium of TV, business news is a field that 
can set the pulse racing.
Key Points
When economies are booming, audiences for business 
• 
television increase. When a recession sets in, audiences 
for business TV decline.
Staff working in business TV must have a common set of 
• 
editorial and visual standards to which they work.
Writing for business television needs to be supplemented 
• 
by excellent graphics and technical wizardry.
Differentiate between hard and soft news, but appreciate 
• 
both are important.
When producing a business documentary, think about 
• 
the audience you are aiming at.

Newswire 
Agencies and 
Their Role
Newswire agencies, also known as newswires,  are vitally important to business 
news journalists, whether they work for newspapers or electronic enterprises. 
Newswire agencies report on events, announcements, economic statistics, and 
other developments that are relevant to the markets.
Journalists at these organizations have to be extra-talented, extra-analytical, 
and above all extra-careful. They normally have a close relationship to busi-
ness, government, politics, bankers, brokers, and other members of the broad 
economic community. This isn’t just because they distribute news to thou-
sands of news outlets and other entities such as banks themselves; it is also 
because both they and the business community need to be sure they get the 
information right.
ONE WORD CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
I once omitted one word from a report on a Morning Business Report bulletin. The story 
I filed said that the homes of executives of leading European plane maker Airbus had 
been raided across Europe in connection with some irregularities at the company.
11
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 11 | Newswire Agencies and Their Role
98
The story went on TV at 0600 in the United States. By 0605, Airbus PR people were 
on the phone, angrily denying the story. I missed out one important word: “former.” It 
was former executives whose homes had been raided. I was a very lucky reporter. The 
mistake, albeit small, was picked up by a professional viewer very quickly. We were able 
to correct the error in seconds.
But if the mistake had been about the company’s shares, for instance, trading could 
have involved millions of dollars changing hands. I hold my hand up to this error, and 
indeed we all make them and will continue to make them. But accuracy is absolutely 
vital to newswire journalists because they send out thousands of bits of vital information 
on companies, stocks, banks, and prices; and one misplaced decimal point can cost a 
company a fortune.
This incident also shows that even if reporters think their story is going out to a “dead” 
audience—one that they can neither see nor hear—business journalists are listened to 
intently by those in the financial sector and beyond. Business journalists have a huge 
audience and a demanding one—which sets them apart from regular news reporters in 
the accuracy stakes.
The Big Three Newswire Agencies
One of the finest news agency journalists I ever worked with was a Dow Jones 
editor. Randy Walerius is an American who was at that time working for the 
Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal bureau in London. He is now back on US soil in 
Washington working with a specialist government unit for Bloomberg.
His view on the importance of newswires is that agencies such as Reuters, 
Bloomberg News, and Dow Jones are among the biggest news organizations 
in the world and have withstood the economic pressure of the past two 
decades better than many newspapers and magazines. The reason is simple. To 
varying degrees, the three companies provide information—news and data—
to financial markets and charge a high price to do so.
The biggest financial newswire agencies sit within companies that sell a range 
of products. Dow Jones—part of News Corp—publishes The Wall Street 
Journal and other newspapers and magazines. Bloomberg owns Bloomberg 
Business Week. Reuters is part of Thomson Reuters, a company that owns 
special publications for lawyers and other professionals. All three companies 
cover not only business and financial markets but also politics, sports, culture, 
and more.
For the newswires within these companies, however, their bread and butter 
comes from selling information to the financial markets: stock, bond, com-
modities, and currency markets. In fact, the growth of the agencies since the 
1980s and their resilience today tracks the growth of financial markets around 
the globe. The financial sector is much bigger in the United States, Europe, 
and Japan than it used to be; and it is present in places like China, Russia, India,

and Brazil where it used to be virtually nonexistent. Financial institutions are 
willing to pay lots of money for news that could change the value of trillions 
of dollars of assets.
The Role of the Newswire Agencies
To compete in that market and to justify the high subscriber fees, the agen-
cies compete ruthlessly on speed, and their credibility depends on accu-
racy. Success is often measured by being fractions of a second faster than a 
competitor. If one customer in the financial markets gets the news slightly 
sooner than another, that customer—or more likely, that customer’s com-
puters—can buy or sell a financial instrument at a better price. The price 
advantage disappears, of course, as soon as the entire market responds to 
the same information.
Hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars’ worth of trading can take 
place because of news that the US central bank is changing interest rates, for 
example, or that one company is making an offer to buy another company, or 
that Saudi Arabia will increase or decrease oil production, or that China’s eco-
nomic policy will raise the demand for copper. The news service that delivers 
that information to its customers first gives the customer a market advantage.
Rule of Thumb
■
■
  The rule of thumb 20 years ago was that a trader who received information 
three seconds before others in the market had enough time to act on that news by buying or selling 
the relevant stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies. Today, with most trading executed by fast 
computers, the time to act is down to milliseconds.
The major customers of the three biggest financial agencies—Dow Jones, 
Reuters, Bloomberg—are banks, hedge funds, companies, and other financial 
institutions. The news reaches them over computer terminals that also carry 
vast amounts of price and other financial data. The computers also have the 
functionality to manipulate that data into charts and other tools to help the 
traders think about prices. For the traders who use the terminals, the news 
typically takes up less of their screen space than the data. But the news is still 
essential for many of them.

■
  Powerful computers can digest ever greater amounts of information and find connections 
between seemingly unrelated items. That has increased the market’s appetite for information in 
recent decades. Companies that once focused on domestic markets are now affected by actions 
on the other side of the world. Pension funds invest their money in assets—financial or physical—in 
many countries. A US economic slowdown will hurt Chinese exports. Droughts in Russia may drive 
up global wheat prices. European rules on carbon emissions may add a cost to US airlines.
So essential is this news that the companies that own these newswire agencies 
have some of the biggest editorial staffs in the world. Reuters and Bloomberg 
each have about 2,400 news professionals in offices around the world. Dow 
Jones, including The Wall Street Journal, has almost 2,000.
Reuters, Bloomberg, and Dow Jones station their employees in bureaus around 
the globe to gather and publish economic statistics from governments and 
central banks, earnings reports and other announcements from companies, 
weather conditions and crop yields, water levels on rivers and strikes at ports, 
car sales and airplane orders, and much more besides. They also cover elec-
tions, military conflicts, social unrest, and—because people who work in finan-
cial markets tend to like games—sports. The journalists seek out interviews 
with central bankers, finance ministers, chief executives, private equity fund 
managers, and others who can offer insight that’s relevant to financial prices.
The United States, Europe, and Japan have the biggest economies and so are 
home to the biggest market centers and most of the world’s biggest com-
panies. The three agencies’ biggest bureaus are therefore likely in New York, 
London, and Tokyo and other major cities. But Moscow, Beijing, and Dubai 
have become market centers in their own right. Reuters has staff in about 
150 countries. Bloomberg has almost 150 bureaus in 72 countries.
The farther the agency bureau is from a modern financial market, the more 
effort the journalists may have to put in to obtain relevant news. Journalists 
in London and Berlin receive most of their information in electronic form, 
quickly digest it, and send it back out to their subscribers. Journalists in the 
Ivory Coast may travel through the cocoa belt to get a sense of how the crop 
looks; those in Vietnam may do the same to evaluate the coffee crop.
NEWS JUDGMENT
One way to think about news judgment in these agencies is to ask whether a piece 
of information may change the price of a stock, bond, commodity, or currency—or 
derivatives of those assets. If the answer is yes—or even just maybe—it’s news. The 
reporter who obtains that information is paid to file it quickly and accurately. The 

Business Journalism
101
headline encapsulates the actionable information and is often sufficient by itself for 
the purposes of financial market customers. The market relevance is obvious in the 
60 or so characters of the headlines: “Bank of England Raises Interest Rates 25 Basis 
Points,” “China Plans to Rein in Bank Lending,” or “Toyota Raises Forecast for Car Sales 
in 2013.”
Governments and Companies as Sources  
of News
The major sources of news are governments and companies. Government 
reports on economic activity such as inflation and retail sales and unemploy-
ment, as well as government policy announcements, provide a steady stream 
of information that the news agencies have to relay to their clients. Corporate 
reports on earnings, acquisitions and sales, and other activity provide a still 
faster flow of information because there are far more companies than there 
are governments in the world.
In advanced economies, governments release economic reports at regular 
intervals and under established rules, often in what is known as a “lockup.” 
Journalists are literally locked in a room and allowed no contact with the 
outside world. They have about half an hour to digest the material in the 
government report. At a specified time, the communications lines are opened 
and the journalists send it out to the markets. In that half hour, the journalists 
have to be able to identify the main news, spot unexpected content in the 
economic data, formulate headlines that convey the main points, and write 
brief stories to back that up.
Think, for example, of a government report on inflation released monthly. 
The journalist in the lockup will identify main headlines that look something 
like these:
June Prices Rose 0.2 Percent from May, 1.7 Percent from June Last  Year
or
Excluding Energy, June Inflation Was 0.1 Percent from May, 1.4 Percent 
from June Last  Year
The journalists will also search through the government report to find other 
nuggets of information that may interest the markets. The pace at which food 
or housing prices are rising may be worthy for additional headlines.
By the time the communications lines are opened, the journalist will have 
formulated as many headlines as are necessary and the story to back those 
headlines up. In that story, the journalist will add context, possibly to explain 
why energy prices were a factor that month or why the market is interested 
in food or housing.

Chapter 11 | Newswire Agencies and Their Role
102
ACCURACY IS KEY
Because accuracy is so essential to this work, the agencies take special care to ensure 
it. They will typically have a policy that says no headline or story can be published 
without a second reader—a “second set of eyes” in agency jargon. And since speed 
is so important, that second reader may be standing behind the writer and reading the 
material over his or her shoulder. Those are minimum standards. Many stories are read 
by several editors; and the most sensitive stories—those that can damage reputations 
or investigative work that could have a broad impact on many markets—are likely to be 
read as often as a dozen times or more, including by the agency’s own libel lawyers.
Modern companies—at least those listed on a modern stock exchange—will 
similarly release earnings under rules set by their regulators, although it is 
rarely as elaborate as a locked room. The companies send an earnings report, 
or a takeover announcement, or some other development to the main news 
agencies, which in turn relay the main points to the markets. As with govern-
ment economic news, the journalists have to move extremely fast to identify 
what the market wants to know, formulate the necessary headlines and story, 
and publish.
In both the government economic news and the company reports, financial 
agency journalists play a crucial role in the modern financial regulatory struc-
ture. Insider trading—trading with information that should be available only 
to a few people—is illegal in many markets. By getting large amounts of infor-
mation to large groups of traders at the same time, the agencies reduce the 
chance that any particular market participants will get information through 
illicit channels and use it to trade profitably.
As with most reputable news organizations, the financial news agencies are 
careful not to allow content to leak out to the market before it is published. 
That attitude is driven not only by the desire to ensure the integrity of the 
content; it’s also driven by the realization that market participants could use 
even seemingly harmless information to profit. The agencies take this respon-
sibility very seriously.
The Role of the Journalist within News 
Agencies
The agencies have teams of journalists with specific expertise. The economic 
experts know where to find the news quickly in a government report and 
the journalists assigned to cover companies know where to look in a com-
pany announcement for key information. Commodities journalists will have 
similar familiarity with supply and demand of things like oil, tin, wheat, or rice. 

Business Journalism
103
Fixed-income experts keep tabs on bond issuance and trends in interest rates. 
Foreign exchange coverage requires knowledge of economic forces that will 
cause traders to move from one currency to another.
In past decades, as the Internet has become prevalent, computers have become 
increasingly important in carrying out tasks that used to be done by journalists, 
or not at all. Computers can scan reports from governments or companies 
in seconds, finding the words that matter and even drawing conclusions from 
those words about whether they signal whether to buy or sell a specific finan-
cial instrument. If a central banker gives a speech in which he repeatedly—and 
perhaps unexpectedly—says he’s “optimistic” about the economy, many financial 
market traders would know what to buy and sell without any quantitative help 
about the meaning of optimism.
Example
■
■
  Several years ago, agencies and markets were watching the statements of the 
European Central Bank closely to see if the bank was “concerned” about inflation or “very concerned” 
about inflation. In this scenario, only one word more or less was needed to determine whether the 
bank had changed its thinking and the policy that would follow from that thinking.
As structured—or computerized—as the release of so much information is 
today, journalists at the financial news services have plenty of opportunity to 
take the initiative and find their own stories. Many events or developments 
are still unexpected. Oil wells explode, hurricanes shut down ports, disease 
strikes plants or animals or human beings, scientists make new discoveries 
that have commercial potential, and businesses spring up to challenge estab-
lished companies. Not so long ago, companies such as Google and Facebook 
didn’t exist. Today, they receive close attention from financial markets and 
from the financial news agencies that serve those markets.
Journalists have to be on the lookout for the things that aren’t announced 
through official channels. They conduct interviews with government officials, 
company executives, fund managers, and others to gain news and insight that 
will be of interest to their market audience. They read reports, visit factories, 
watch consumer trends, and much more.
If, for example, a Russian energy company’s financial reports show lack of 
investment in new equipment for many years, the journalist may draw the 
conclusion that the company will be able to produce less energy in the future. 
Energy markets around the world will be interested. Or if a European govern-
ment official says in an interview that the European Union should consider 
a tax on financial transactions, the journalist will be able to tell the market 
about a potential additional cost of doing business that will fall on thousands 
of financial institutions and companies and individuals.

Chapter 11 | Newswire Agencies and Their Role
104
To manage the demands of so many areas of coverage that require so 
much expertise, the financial news agencies have to coordinate their own 
journalists to make sure the expertise is deployed effectively. That could 
require collaboration among energy journalists around the world or it 
could require collaboration among journalists in a single bureau whose 
tasks don’t typically overlap.
Tip
■
■
  For aspiring journalists, the financial news agencies are among the bright lights in the 
news business. Their broad coverage means the agencies need journalists with a much wider 
range of skills than most newspapers, and their global reach means the skilled journalists with the 
necessary language skills can find opportunities that aren’t so easy to come by in other parts of 
the news business.
The Importance of Pictures
Most big news agencies now have a television arm. They feed news stories 
with pictures. One of the problems for these news agencies and especially 
some of the smaller wire services is to have video content that can be used 
to illustrate the stories in an attractive way.
Reuters had a huge library of film and video at one time, but even that huge 
agency was forced to recycle the same old footage of dollars or pounds 
rolling off the presses, the facades of the Bank of England, the Hong Kong 
Stock Exchange, or Wall Street, and the closing-bell ritual on the New York 
trading floor.
These pictures were known as “wall paper.” The story was in the script 
and in the interviews or sound bites from financial experts. But as Jim 
Boulden, CNN's London correspondent, points out, television is a picture 
medium. A story depends as much, if not more, on its visual impact as on 
its script content.
The three big newswire agencies have hundreds of correspondents around 
the world. But even for them, gathering video material for every occasion and 
every event is a step too far. That limitation has given rise to picture agencies, 
which I cover in the next chapter.

Getting the 
Pictures
Images are an essential feature of journalism. They help tell the story.
Pictures—video or photographs—can bring the story to life, whereas words 
need supplements to reinforce details of the story. Whether it is the sedate 
opening of a parliament or a horrific story of a plane crash, images bring a 
story to life and are important to the telling of a tale.
General news requires photographs and video to illustrate a story and  
photojournalism has become an important arm of journalism. Photojournalists 
(and the term includes video) help interpret events and communicate news-
worthy information through still or moving images, used in conjunction with a 
written story or sometimes on their own with nothing more than a caption. 
Some television news programs even run a sequence of video stories without 
commentary—usually captioned “No Comment”— relying on the moving 
pictures to tell the story on their own.
The News through Images
Photojournalists “write” with a camera and disseminate news events through 
images. Editors choose front-page pictures carefully to attract readers, but 
they also use photos to illustrate less important events through head-and-
shoulders shots of the story’s subject.
Editors argue that photographs in journalism inform, educate, and enlighten 
readers about current issues and enhance the credibility of stories, confirming 
the authenticity of a news story and providing proof that an event has actually 
occurred.

THINGS AREN’T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM
As an editor, I used to subscribe to the Columbia Journalism Review, produced by 
students of the excellent journalism school at New York’s Columbia University. A feature 
of the Review was showing a photograph that had appeared in a wide number of 
publications from around the world with different captions used for the same picture.
One example was the photo of a Boeing 737 jet standing on a runway. Captions varied 
from “Plane hijackers are holding hostages on board a New York bound plane” to “Boeing 
has unveiled its new short-haul aircraft.”
Pictures for business news can vary wildly. Especially in television, dull pictures 
of banks, factories, and shopping malls are used extensively. But when the 
story is about the financial cost of natural events, such as hurricanes, forest 
fires, or devastating snowstorms, the images can be very dramatic and make 
a story come alive.
Radio is the poor cousin here, but almost all other media can use images 
to good effect. The important thing for any journalist is to treat the choice 
of pictures sensitively to ensure that false meaning isn’t created and ethics 
aren’t breached.
ETHICS IN PHOTOJOURNALISM
Ethics plays a great part in ensuring that this ideal—that photographs in journalism 
inform, educate, and enlighten—is met.
Editors can sometimes be cruel with photo manipulation. One UK newspaper, for 
example, published a photograph of Cherie Blair, wife of the former UK Prime Minister. 
The picture was of Mrs. Blair on a speaker’s platform where two small flags had been 
situated. The photo made it look as if two horns were protruding from her head, giving 
her a satanic appearance. One columnist, on seeing this picture, dubbed the good lady 
“The Wicked Witch,” and the name stuck.
Editors must also keep a strict eye on photos taken on mobile phones by  
citizen journalists. Those photos are not always what they purport to be.
Despite these cautions, photojournalism—both still photography and  
videography—can, used responsibly, make a news story very attractive to 
a reader and viewer. As long as it is honest, a picture can indeed be worth 
a thousand words.

The Challenge of Sourcing Pictures
Simon Brooksbank is the executive video editor for the European bureau of 
Getty Images, a giant US picture agency with an enviable reputation. But he 
entered the television news agency business at Reuters, working on a financial 
program called Financial Report. (Financial Report was shortened to FINREP, and 
so it was known within Reuters for a decade.)
This program was a review of the important business, economic, and financial 
news of the week and was transmitted to client television stations at 0300 on 
a Saturday morning. The timing was dictated by the closing time of the New 
York Stock Exchange, which was at 2100 GMT, so the program’s final details 
had to be collated, scripted, and picture coordinated after that time before 
being sent via satellite to more than 80 TV stations worldwide.
The program was broadcast with a split track. A split track is a video report 
that is produced with an English-language commentary but is formatted 
so that a client newsroom can ignore the English voice-over and have its 
own newsreader provide a commentary, reading from the script provided. 
Brooksbank was assistant producer on the show and part of his job was to 
make sure suitable video was available to “cover” the script. This need not be 
too complicated for a 2'40" news package, but for a half-hour program it was 
a nightmare.
The scripting of the program began on Thursdays. The news of the week 
was collated and the events likely to occur on Thursday and Friday were 
noted from one of the big news agency diary companies. Brooksbank helped 
research the stories, discussed the importance of each with me, and helped 
produce a running order.
Note

■
  My role was as producer. In other words, if there were any errors in the program, it was my 
head on the block with fierce line editors in offices tucked well away from the newsroom floor relishing 
the opportunity to cut it off if any errors were made.
But Brooksbank also had the tough job of sourcing picture content from video 
stock content, which was then held in Reuters’ own library. All news video 
from correspondents, camera crews, client television stations, and indepen-
dent producers was recorded, logged, and put into a huge library. For FINREP, 
Brooksbank would digest the stories, look at catalogued video and the week’s 
news coverage, and begin to compile the available footage that was suitable to 
“paint” onto the script.

Chapter 12 | Getting the Pictures
108
He also had access to the then-many PR and VNR (video news release)  
companies that distributed video stock content for free around the media 
in a bid to get coverage for their clients. This VNR material was a godsend 
because the producers of it were anxious to see the use of pictures of their 
clients’ products, which could range from cars to airplanes. It was a terrific 
source of content, as it was well shot, edited, and presented and could vary 
from auto manufacturing to hi-tech engineering to bank notes being printed 
to coffee beans being picked.
As FINREP was a voice-led program, it was a case of painting images over the 
script to best illustrate what was being reported. The trick was to keep looking 
for more of the same, as monotonous repetition had to be avoided to keep the 
show fresh. Brooksbank needed to supply us with many different shots of, say, 
coffee beans being picked, so it didn’t feel as though we were rehashing the same 
shots. As and when he found good clips, he’d compile them on to master tapes 
(Beta SP back then), and he’d just keep building the archive.
All this material was collected over the two days, with the activity for getting 
suitable pictures getting more frenzied as the hours ticked by on a Friday.
If, for example, a hurricane started wreaking destruction somewhere in the 
world around about supper time, then Brooksbank had to go chasing the 
pictures, trying to determine if they would come in by satellite in time to  
be used over the inevitable coffee prices story or the Lloyds’ insurance story 
related to the damage the storms had created.
But that was then. This background led Brooksbank to his job as executive 
producer at Getty Images, one of today’s leading providers of stock images 
and video.
Presentation Is Key
Today, the content of business reporting hasn’t changed that much, but 
Brooksbank is in accord with Jim Boulden that viewers’ expectations are 
higher when it comes to production values. Content is easier to acquire now 
that we live in a global village, and so there’s no excuse for poor quality of 
presentation and video.
Brooksbank says, “This makes the hunt for the best quality content exciting—
the thrill of the chase as it were … and when we find a unique filmmaker in 
some far flung region who has unique content that’s rarely been seen who 
wants to partner up, that’s a good day.”

  There has been a long-held belief among many news producers that American television 
understands news presentation rather better than their UK counterparts but that the Brits pay more 
attention to the news content. I’ve often been in hot debates about the veracity of this view, and my 
personal opinion is that the two news cultures have come closer together in recent years.
THE ABILITY TO SHOP AROUND FOR NEWS
News content, no matter how good, won’t on its own attract a viewer, and most certainly 
won’t keep a viewer’s attention. But audiences are often more sophisticated than the 
profession gives them credit for and presentation alone won’t cover up sloppy journalism, 
bad reporting, and a naïve selection of stories. Now that access to hundreds of TV 
channels is available, the viewer and you can “shop and compare.” News channels, 
whether dedicated totally to business such as CNBC or general news with business 
content as in BBC World News, are commonplace on TV screens. Watch carefully, 
make a comparison, and both assess whether the content versus presentation debate 
is still valid and see which news channel becomes your favorite after taking a view on 
the debate.
Today, Brooksbank’s job is to ensure the broadcaster has the widest possible 
choice of moving pictures or “images.” He has a counterpart at Getty who 
deals in still photography, and this setup is pretty much the same in all the 
other big picture agencies: Reuters, Associated Press Television News (APTN), 
and Agence France-Presse. There are hundreds of other smaller news agencies 
and some that are based on national demands, such as Russia’s RIA Novosti 
and China’s Xinhua.
How Getty Images and Other Picture 
Agencies Work
How do these agencies gather their news pictures from around the world?
First, Getty Images, for instance, has 90 million still images and 1.3 million 
video clips available on its website and is available in more than 100 coun-
tries. This volume obviously grows as new pictures and video are submitted. 
The stills and video run across news, sport, entertainment, and creative stock. 
Photos and stills are more suitable to features rather than news.
News organizations (as well as advertising agencies, moviemakers, documen-
tary producers, and others) can search the site under different categories for 
the images they want and buy them online, ready to use in a news bulletin 
or documentary.

Chapter 12 | Getting the Pictures
110
Modern technology has made this capability available on demand. But when I 
first worked at Reuters, correspondents were still shooting a story on video 
(very occasionally on film, depending on which country the story was happen-
ing in), driving to the airport, handing the video to the pilot of a friendly airline 
on the end of a long pole, and thus “air mailing” it to London, Paris, New York, 
or some other major news center. A dispatch rider would then be waiting at 
the airport of choice to whisk the tape to the newsroom where it would be 
edited and put on a daily satellite feed to various countries.
Reuters, for instance, sent a daily feed containing half a dozen or more stories 
via satellite to Latin America—the video all carefully edited and scripted for 
use. But the delays were obvious. What happened today might not arrive at 
distant television stations until the day after tomorrow, so news in pictures 
was always broadcast well after the fact. For business news, this was disastrous 
because, as you will have gathered from other items in this book, business 
news needs to be almost instantaneous so that financial markets can decide 
where the money should go.
Note
■
■
  Instant availability has become an attractive option for news and business news 
organizations, especially as the “breaking news” concept has taken hold among nearly all global 
news broadcasters.
Today Getty is representative of other stock agencies with around 35 million 
searches for content each month. So the agency has teams of creative research-
ers who compile lists of the sort of content people have been searching for 
but can’t find. This is translated by the editorial department into searching for, 
developing, and displaying different versions of images already on the site but 
with a different angle. This enables Getty editors to be very specific when it 
comes to collecting data of what is needed to better fulfill the demands of 
the market and to plug content gaps. The data is collected and collated by the  
researchers who then let editorial know where, when, or if the content 
emphasis should be changed.
The trends make interesting reading, especially for editors and publishers who 
need to know what their readership or viewership is and how it is changing. In 
2013, for example, the key areas of focus were Brazil, Japan, and the German 
language regions, where demand for content has grown enormously.
The trend information might be general—for example, which region is 
demanding what sort of images. But editors then know exactly what is needed 
and from where. This enables them to target very specific producers who 
may have shot films or documentaries in these countries and then persuade 
them to change their spots and swap the role of client into supplier, offering in 
exchange some of the material they have shot for sale on the Getty site.

Business Journalism
111
WHAT TO DO WITH EXTRA MATERIAL
Often, producers and directors of documentaries never think that the extra material 
they have shot (and some companies will shoot a ratio of 15:1—that is, for every minute 
of video used, they shoot for 15 minutes) is useful. For example, images of monkeys 
swinging in trees could be very useful for a news item that is about decimation of the 
rainforests. Clients often have specific types of content they never thought would be of 
any value beyond the production for which they were originally intended.
Keeping Imagery Current
As noted in Chapter 11, “wall papering” a business story is no longer accept-
able. Business news is now headline news as often as not, and both print and 
video enterprises need to make their stories attractive. The standard shots of 
Wall Street and the Bank of England are no longer acceptable.
So the big picture agencies keep a “needs” list that applies to all countries 
globally, and they always need updated versions of all business-related images 
on every topic. For example, it is no longer acceptable to run pictures of 
trading floors with dealers dressed in multicolored jackets and waving their 
arms. The electronic age has taken over, and while the pictures of these ani-
mated traders made for exciting television, the truth now is that dealers sit 
transfixed by a computer screen. Not as exciting, but the video still needs to 
be up to date.
Business news also requires quite straightforward shots, pretty much everything  
from industry, manufacturing, agriculture, shipping, mining, retail, banking, renew-
able energy, and so on—or, as Brooksbank puts it, “Basically every aspect of the 
beating heart of any and every country.”
But these images are finite. A picture of a factory belching out smoke is use-
less if the country it is in has passed stiff clean air laws, and an old picture of 
a building on a green field site is inappropriate if the business has expanded 
or other buildings have grown up around it. Business news is no different than 
other news. Images must be fresh and up to date.
The Business of Video Clips
Picture agencies generally have video teams in London, New York, and Los 
Angeles, and video content is also acquired from allied contributors. Getty, 
along with other major news agencies, makes great efforts to find suitable 
contributors and then mentor them so they supply suitable content that is 
technically competent.

Chapter 12 | Getting the Pictures

In the very competitive television world, the video content of business  
programs has become increasingly important. So Getty, Reuters, and others 
have correspondingly taken on key roles.
But, much as this resource is valued, it is still up to producers and editors to 
make sure their choice of pictures is as suitable to the content as they can 
make it. Gone are the days where the same pictures of The Bank of England or 
Federal Reserve can be simply pasted onto a voice. The audience is now much 
more sophisticated and won’t tolerate such a slovenly way of presentation. 
And no production team—least one that has put together a business news 
item—wants to lose an audience.

New Media
Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and 
the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into 
new bottles, and both are preserved.
—Matt. 9:17
But can you put old media into new technologies without the old media 
perishing?
Opinion is divided on this question. Many advocates of new media claim that 
the advent of modern communications systems is whittling away at traditional 
forms of media and will eventually cause the demise of print and electronic 
media as we now know it. Traditionalists point to the fact that the newspaper 
industry has taken a hit but is now holding up well, while terrestrial/satellite 
TV stations continue to proliferate.
Both sides have passionate advocates of the value and sustainability of one 
type of media or the other, which has led to entrenched positions.
The Past, Present, and Future of the Media
In the 1950s, with the advent of television, radio was supposed to disappear. 
It fought back with the introduction of disc jockeys and phone-in hosts. TV 
forced radio to change and in some ways improve. TV also eroded the movie 
industry, until Hollywood hit back with blockbusters and multiscreen cinemas.
The changes in the industry have historically come from conflict between 
different media, which have certainly not expired but persist in a somewhat 
different form today. The Web has forced TV, newspapers, and magazines to 
change, but the prophets of doom and gloom for traditional media should 
temper their forecasts that newspapers and TV have a terminal illness.

Anyone who claims social media will eliminate mass media is failing to look 
at the statistics. In the United States, for example, there has been an overall 
decline in viewing figures on the old-fashioned boob tube. But according to 
Nielsen, television viewing numbers on all devices are beginning to rise again.
Note

■
  What is changing is technology, which is indifferent to program content. Surveys show 
more people in both America and Britain using computers, tablets, and smartphones to watch TV, 
but they still watch traditional programming.
Newspapers have lost circulation in most Western countries over a decade, 
but they have increased in developing nations, especially Africa. Nonetheless, 
there are still more than 160 million people annually buying newspapers in the 
United States (according to the Newspaper Association of America) and more 
than 30 million in the UK (according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation).
New technology has certainly reduced the number of people a newspaper or 
TV station employs, and there is certainly a shift in audiences for all traditional 
media. But I suspect that the quote attributed to Mark Twain over his own 
obituary—“The report of my death was an exaggeration”—may well apply to 
traditional media.
My guess is that there will be sharp changes in the way traditional media oper-
ates but less of a dramatic impact from new media. The chances are that they 
will use each other as they develop, bringing the strengths of each genre to a 
general development of future news media.
One thing is for sure. The development and continuing changes in open 
markets throughout the world have given a huge new pool of stories for the 
business journalist to trawl and that is to be savored for now.
The Future of the News Industry
Stephen Claypole is a former colleague and friend who, after a distinguished 
career at BBC News and Executive Editor at Reuters, set up the TV news arm 
of Associated Press, APTV, now called APTN. Claypole is now chairman of a 
thriving independent television production company, and I regularly meet him 
in that capacity for a glass of wine and to discuss the state of the TV sector 
generally and chat over any bright ideas we might have in helping to develop 
new television news enterprises.
But at each of these meetings, he cautions about getting carried away with 
electronic and new media as a panacea for the survival of broadcasting.

Business Journalism
115
“We are,” Claypole says, “or should be content providers. That is the impor-
tant element of the news business.” By this he means that news people 
should gather and assemble news and information rather than fret about 
the distribution medium.
I believe that in many ways he is right, although I can also have deep discussions 
with other senior journalists who take the opposite view and believe new 
media is the answer to almost everything and has a very different future than 
the one that the news industry faces right now.
New Media Journalism and the Citizen 
Journalist
The creation of the Internet has resulted in blogs, news sites, web sites,  
podcasts, and video opportunities such as YouTube. Today professional  
journalists and individuals alike can offer news to the masses. This change 
in content provider and delivery method has become known as “new media 
journalism.”
The obvious advantage to professional journalists has been the speed with 
which news can be delivered, including live coverage via mobile phone. But 
the headache is that so-called citizen journalists—ordinary individuals who 
see, hear, or identify something—eagerly submit voice, text, and video from a 
phone while actually witnessing some unusual activity.
So far, so good. But then an intake editor or desk journalist has to take the 
decision about the authenticity of the events a nonprofessional is reporting. 
Even video pictures can be open to interpretation and can be seen from a 
viewpoint that doesn’t necessarily reflect the facts.
That doesn’t mean to say that citizen journalists aren’t a valuable addition to 
the way news is collected. But it does mean that professional journalists need 
to be extra vigilant before passing on to the public the information sent to 
them for all the reasons that are outlined in the chapter on ethics.
But new media journalism isn’t confined to the activities of citizen journalists. 
Anyone can now write a blog, set up their own web site, or run their own 
radio and TV station on the Web. And many will applaud the fact that this sort 
of journalism is now available to the average person. After all, don’t we all have 
opinions of one sort or another and shouldn’t we be free to express them?

Chapter 13 | New Media
116
Policing the New Media
But who monitors these new outlets? Who is there to be “editor” of the 
information, to ensure that expressions of opinion are not libelous or causing 
harm to innocent individuals?
The recent phone hacking scandal by journalists and senior editors at the 
now defunct News of the World newspaper has demonstrated that established 
media has been found wanting in controlling its news-gathering activities and 
has been used by some advocates of new media as good reason to give citizen 
journalism free rein.
The other argument is that the law can protect people from libel and false 
reporting. Indeed, so it can, but sometimes not until an individual or enterprise 
has had its reputation blackened beyond repair.
A recent UK court case found that messages on Twitter posted by Sally 
Bercow, the wife of the Speaker of the British House of Commons, were 
defamatory. Bercow sent a text on the social media service implying that a 
member of the aristocracy, Lord McAlpine, was linked to a child sex abuse 
case. Others made the same claim and were eventually brought before  
the courts. Bercow denied malicious intent, but the court ruled that the dam-
age had been done: McAlpine was in the public eye a pedophile.
McAlpine’s solicitor, Andrew Reid of RMPI LLP, said, with some justification, 
that the court judgment against Bercow “provides both a warning to, and  
guidance for, people who use social media. It highlights how established legal 
principles apply to social media, and how the courts take account of the 
particular way in which social media operates when reaching decisions on 
whether publications are defamatory.”1
For having recycled the libel, the BBC and ITV, Britain’s leading broadcasters, 
reached out-of-court settlements with McAlpine, who also successfully pursued 
judgments against individual re-tweeters. The case highlights the danger to estab-
lished media of rushing to report from new media without adequate vetting.
The McAlpine case occurred in a sophisticated civil society. There are still 
many countries, however, where the only qualification to be a journalist is 
simply to say, “I am a journalist.” So the dangers of misreporting and unprofes-
sional conduct are often very close to the surface when new media is used 
to pass on news.

A Change in Traditional News Organizations
Technology and new media have had a profound impact on the way that  
traditional news organizations operate. The sector has become congested 
with news, fragmenting sources and altering target audiences for all types 
of media. The number of web sites specializing in new media journalism has 
grown so large and popular that there are now major players in the field, such 
as the US’s conservative Drudge Report (www.drudgereport.com) and liberal 
The Huffington Post (www.huffingtonpost.com).
Traditional media profess a neutral stance (disingenuously, many critics argue), 
but many new media outlets abandon all pretence at neutrality and expound 
opinion on their web sites, leaving the readers to make up their own minds 
about the veracity of the information published. But many journalists from 
established media have set up their own independent blogs, bringing a new 
professionalism to the new media sector; while, conversely, many traditional 
outlets have introduced new media journalism platforms to multiply their 
outlets to the public.
The style of traditional journalism has changed to accommodate the use of 
new media by adding online editions to the still flourishing newspaper sector. 
New journalism is no longer constrained by space or time, in contrast to 
the constraints binding traditional newspaper editors, who have to calculate 
how many stories they want in a given edition and how many words to allow 
reporters to fill in the spaces allotted for each story.
As a very young reporter, I worked for a very experienced Canadian editor on 
a Vancouver weekly, The Lions Gate Times. He sent me to cover the premiere of 
a film version of James Joyce’s Ulysses.
It’s a complicated plot, but I wrote a magnificent article (by my own reckoning) 
and proudly submitted the copy. When I read the article in the newspaper, it 
finished halfway through the story I had written and in mid-sentence. The 
editor had been ruthless. I had exceeded my words, and he had no space in 
the paper to let me get away with it.
Radio and TV are even more unforgiving. A five-minute news bulletin is a  
five-minute news bulletin: no more, no less. Time is precious in mainstream 
electronic media. And in a long career in electronic media, I was only once 
ever allowed to go over time, and that was under exceptional circumstances.
I was hosting a radio program on the problems of alcoholism. To demonstrate 
how the effects can creep up on you without you realizing it, the engineers set 
up a series of skills tests in the studio, such as a device that set off a bell. I had 
to react to the bell by hitting a button. Throughout the program I drank beer 
at the rate I would at a social function, and as I attempted to perform each 

Chapter 13 | New Media
118
task, my reaction time was posted. At the end of the program, I was certainly 
not drunk, but my reaction time had been considerably extended. But the  
cardinal sin was that I ran two minutes over program time. I was never allowed 
to do that ever again either on radio or TV.
So space and time are restricting factors for text and electronic media. But 
one of the advantages of new media is that a story can be as long as a writer 
wants it to be. The shackles are off.
A COMMENT ON THE HABITS OF TODAY’S READERS
Whether a reader wants long pieces of text is another matter. Already critics complain 
that politicians of every color and every nation no longer read at all. But whether that is 
general among the populace is debatable.
I would only point to the fact that Britain’s best-selling daily paper, The Sun, is dominated 
by pictures, includes very catchy headlines, and has limited text—there is almost no  
in-depth reporting. Perhaps that says something about the reading habits of much of 
the general population.
The Literature of the Everyday
When it comes to a writing style for new media, the adage—“The golden rule 
is that there is no golden rule”—really comes into its own. Because there are 
really no rules governing writing for new media.
The guidelines outlined earlier in this book about writing styles for newspa-
pers and TV ought in principle to apply as much to new media as to tradi-
tional news outlets, perhaps allowing for a little more license than traditional 
media does for a free-flowing style. But those who practiced new media in its 
infancy were mostly from the world of literature and set out to cast off the 
constraints, as they saw them, of the newswriting style of late 20th- and early 
21st-century newspapers.
It is a bit more difficult to modify the style of writing for radio and television, 
because the ear and the eye react reflexively to the terse, cryptic writing 
required by electronic media. But many TV journalists now have to write for 
a TV station’s web version and so must master both styles.
The style for new media—if there is one—has been described as the “litera-
ture of the everyday.” And so it is. No one blog will be quite like any other. 
Twitter has its own language. And personal web sites reflect the idiosyncratic 
style of the individual writer.

Business Journalism
119
Each of us has our own way of expressing ourselves in written language, from 
grammar and word usage to retailing slang and the language of the street. The 
famous legless World War II fighter pilot Douglas Bader is quoted as saying, 
“Rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of wise men.” That 
seems to be good advice for how to write for new media: let yourself go, but 
don’t write so that no one has any idea what you are writing about.
Blog authors tend to write in such a way that their ideas flow freely: a stream-
of-consciousness style of writing. Others retain a formality, their style born 
of the discipline of newswriting of the last century and the strict style format 
under which they served their apprenticeships.
Note
■
■
  I must confess that I have been penning text for newspapers and television so long that 
breaking away from a more formal style proves exceedingly difficult. But with new media, it doesn’t 
matter. I can more or less write in any way that takes my mood.
But don’t fall into the trap of ignoring the basic news principles outlined in 
various parts of this book. If you are reporting on important events, then 
make sure both guidelines and style are dictated by the audience and the grav-
ity of the subject.
Write all you want in any style you want; but if no one bothers to read it, 
your sense of satisfaction at what you wrote can drain away very rapidly. As a 
journalist, you still have an irreducible responsibility for your output and must 
always strive for credibility.
Out with the Old?
New media writing can be very satisfying. It is writing that comes from deep 
within you. It is yours.
I am an old skeptic. I always believed that good journalists had an overdose of 
skepticism in their veins. It helped them to get to the truth of a story, to write 
as the facts dictate and the audience demands.
I have my doubts whether the freedom of new media will eventually overtake 
or even destroy traditional media, as some believe. But if that day should 
come, I must either adapt to the new media or die with the old.
Only time will tell what the outcome will be.

Key Points
Today’s news people should be “content providers”—that 
• 
is, they should gather and assemble news and information—
rather than worry about the distribution medium.
The Internet has brought us new media journalism, 
• 
enabling professional journalists and individuals alike to 
write news for the masses. But with this new freedom 
comes new responsibilities.
Although basic journalistic principles apply when writing for 
• 
new media, the formats associated with new media allow 
for the expression of more personal, free-form views.

Macroeconomics
Each individual nation has an economy of its own, which is more about general 
statistics than the type of business data found in a specific type of market. This 
is known as macroeconomics.
Macroeconomic data is basically examining facts and figures to reflect how 
healthy an economy is. And there are some statistics related to macroeco-
nomics that are vital to understanding what is happening to a country and any 
impact those events might have globally.
The US non-farm payroll data, for example, is important to the United States 
but is also eagerly watched by market analysts the world over. American 
unemployment can and does have an impact on the global economy and must 
be watched by business journalists wherever they are.
Economists use a range of information to gauge economic health such as 
employment figures (non-farm payroll in the United States), gross domestic 
product (GDP) money supply, consumer prices, producer prices, and retail 
sales data.
This information can indicate whether there is a recession or prosperity loom-
ing; what government can do about it; which part of society will be affected; 
how much items in, say, a supermarket cost; and if there are any inflationary 
fears to look out for.
In other words, macroeconomics tells us how a country is doing financially.
So this is an area that business journalists need to understand and keep an eye 
on. They need to be able to tell people what they can expect in cost of living, 
employment, rising prices, and other events that will affect how we all live and 
support ourselves.

A MEASURE OF THE US AND WORLD ECONOMIES
Each month, the US Department of Labor Statistics releases a report about the number 
of people employed in manufacturing and construction as one of the indicators of the 
growth or shrinkage of the US economy. As its title, non-farm payroll data, implies, it 
does not include workers in agriculture or the nonprofit sector.
This employment report is considered very carefully in global financial markets because 
it will dictate the value of the dollar, foreign exchange markets, and bond and stock 
markets.
The numbers are compared month by month, and when they are buoyant a collective 
sigh of relief is heard around the financial world. Job losses bring dark clouds of gloom 
over the financial sector and the state of the global economy suffers.
Key Economic Measures
From the indicators just mentioned, economists take as key measures of  
economic prosperity national income, unemployment figures, inflation, and 
international trade data.
National Income and Gross Domestic Product
National income is the measure of the monetary value of the flow of 
output of goods and services produced in an economy over a 12-month 
period and is a measure of economic growth, changes to living standards, and 
the distribution of income.
A NEED FOR ACCURATE MODELS
Because a national economy is extremely complex, economists have followed the KISS 
(keep it simple, stupid) advice given to journalists; they have tried to simplify the data 
contained in economic reports so that others can readily identify the main points of 
interest or concern. This is because they need to both understand very quickly the 
economic state of a nation but also apply the statistics to “models” that attempt to predict 
what the trends are and how to prepare for future problems—that is, how the system as 
a whole may be expected to behave. Economists strive to produce as accurate models 
as possible so that governments can develop successful development plans and policies 
for the national economy, thus promoting growth and overall prosperity.

Business Journalism
123
The more widely used indicator of a country’s economic health is 
GDP, which is the total value of output in an individual economy that mea-
sures the change in economic activity.
GDP includes capital investment, government spending, exports of goods and 
services, imports, and the output of foreign owned businesses that are located 
in a country (as long as they are the result of direct foreign investment). GDP 
is also calculated on the incomes from workers, private enterprise profits, and 
rents in the private sector.
GDP is usually measured in a common currency, and the US dollar is widely 
used. Exchange rates are notoriously volatile, so to provide more accuracy to 
the worldwide measurement of GDP, economists put a “basket” of goods and 
services common to most countries and look at the prices of the contents of 
that basket in different countries.
For example, the UK basket is made up of items that the average household 
purchases regularly and includes such things as breakfast cereals, chocolates, 
fruit, beer, computers, and even baby wipes. The basket is reviewed each year 
to make sure it reflects the purchasing habits of the average family. A sample 
of goods in the American basket can include new vehicles, airline fares, and 
gasoline.
Most of these indicators in the United States are released by various gov-
ernment departments. Non-farm payroll numbers are released monthly, the 
Bureau of Economic Accounts gives out GDP data, and the consumer price 
index (CPI) is measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (monthly), as is 
the producer price index (PPI). Retail sales come weekly from the US Census 
Bureau, and money supply statistics come from the Federal Reserve Board.
Note
■
■
  Money supply data is quite complicated and new journalists should research the various 
grades of the meaning of money supply from M0, which contains bank reserves in the calculations, to 
M3, which includes large deposits. M2 is the main indicator and is used in the measurement of inflation.
The agencies in other countries vary, but governments use broadly the same 
indicators to assess the strength of their national economies. For example, 
in the UK, monthly unemployment figures come from the Office of National 
Statistics, as does CPI, PPI, and retail sales. Money supply data is provided by 
The Bank of England.
All this data is available on the web sites of the responsible organizations.
Most journalists working in the big newswire agencies such as Reuters will 
have direct contacts in the agencies and banks, so for the average business 
journalist, using the wire services is probably the wisest way to go.

Chapter 14 | Macroeconomics
124
The wire services “flash” important figures, generally with some description 
of what they will mean to either the national or global economies. The com-
mentary is written by real experts.
THE EFFECT OF TRANSFERS ON GDP
A word of caution about the commonly used term “transfers”; this usually means the 
private transfer of money from one individual to another. Such transactions are not 
usually taken into account in developed economies when GDP is calculated.
During the various wars across Europe in the last two decades of the 20th century, 
many people fled from the countries in conflict to more stable countries nearby. For 
example, many citizens of the Western Balkans fled to Germany, France, and the UK.
They flourished in these countries and now send substantial funds back to relatives, 
who remained in economies that are still very weak by international standards. These 
funds are known as “transfers,” and the state of the national economy or GDP would be 
very different if these transfers were not taken into account.
Unemployment
Unemployment or joblessness is measured as those people who are out of 
work but want to work and are looking for jobs. It does not include people 
who are permanently on social benefits, including sick or disabled people who 
cannot work.
High levels of unemployment are costly to any economy, established or emerg-
ing. Such costs include unemployment benefit costs, other benefit payments, 
and lower tax revenues because unemployed individuals not only receive ben-
efits but also pay no income tax. And because most unemployed people spend 
less, they contribute less to the government in indirect taxes, such as sales tax.
Unemployment also causes a waste of scarce economic resources and 
reduces the long-run growth potential of the economy—the man-hours that 
the unemployed do not work are lost forever.
As Europe has discovered, high and persistent unemployment can also have 
high security costs. The Eurozone economic crisis of the last decade has cre-
ated wealth inequality across formerly stable EU member states such as Spain, 
Italy, Greece, and Portugal. Other EU members have had to make huge con-
tributions to try and save the economies of these nations with only limited 
success. As a consequence, citizens have taken to the streets in violent and 
volatile demonstrations against their own governments, membership in the 
European Union, subscribing to the Euro currency, and the widespread lack 
of jobs.

Business Journalism
125
This is costly to governments but also threatens the breakup of an economic 
union that seeks to expand, not lose members, and the loss of confidence of 
its unemployed citizens. Such protests are not confined to the EU but have 
taken place in many other countries around the globe as the worldwide eco-
nomic crisis struck.
All these factors have a negative effect on long-term economic growth. 
Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources 
but also because it drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity (limiting labor 
mobility), and erodes self-esteem (promoting social dislocation, unrest, and 
conflict).
Inflation
Economists worry about inflation all the time and so do financial journalists. It 
is something that is key to a healthy economy and bears watching.
Inflation occurs when an economy suffers a persistent increase in the general 
price level of goods and services over a period of time. When price levels rise, 
for example, the pound or dollar buys fewer goods and services, resulting in a 
reduction in the purchasing power per pound or dollar.
Inflation is generally seen as bad for an economy; it means an increase in the 
cost of holding money, discourages investment and savings, triggers price rises, 
and then impacts on employers as workers demand higher wages to compen-
sate for loss of currency value. In other words, their paycheck buys less.
The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to a 
nation’s central bank (The Bank of England in the UK or the Federal Reserve 
in the United States are examples), which sets interest rates. The theory is 
that higher interest rates curb spending, thereby relieving pressure on levels 
of inflation. High interest rates and slow growth of the money supply are the 
traditional ways through which central banks fight or prevent inflation.
The inflation rate is usually measured through the CPI, which measures move-
ments in prices of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by a “typical 
consumer.” In the UK, the retail prices index (RPI) is added as a measure of 
inflation and contains a larger basket of goods and services.

  Don’t confuse monetary policy with a government’s fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is how the 
government uses its taxes and budgets its cash. As a journalist you should watch for changes in the 
level and composition of taxation, government spending, and levels of borrowing.

Chapter 14 | Macroeconomics
126
International Trade Data
International trade is the exchange of goods, services, and capital across 
national borders. Countries such as the United States and political units such 
as the European Union believe in free trade—in other words the less restric-
tion put on trading between countries, the better.
However, countries will periodically impose tariffs, which form a barrier to 
free trade. Tariffs are usually imposed to protect industries or sectors of a 
country against imported goods that undercut the price of a domestic prod-
uct; they are taxes on imports that make imported goods more expensive and 
less competitive.
The European Union, for example, is fiercely protective of its agricultural sec-
tor and has imposed a tariff (import tax) of up to 75% on some meat and dairy 
products to discourage foreign imports. The United States protected its tire 
industry by slapping a 35% tax on imports from China.
Apart from tariffs, some countries impose quotas on imports and sometimes 
embargoes, a total ban on the imports of certain goods.
In 1994, the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established and is the 
only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between 
nations. Almost all the world’s trading nations, large and small, subscribe to 
the WTO, which grew from earlier negotiations under an international body 
known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).)
Belonging to the WTO means a country has signed a legal document that 
provides the ground rules for international commerce and to help trade flow 
as freely as possible between nations.
Associated with international trade are a country’s balance of payments, which 
are the payments made for imports and exports. Balance of payments, like a 
commercial balance sheet, must always balance. Any trade deficit must be 
balanced with foreign investment, a decline in national reserves, or increased 
debt; likewise a trade surplus will be balanced out with financial outflows or 
increased reserves.
The Central Banks
Referring back to central banks, The Bank of England, affectionately known as 
“The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street” because it has existed on the same 
site since 1734, and the US Federal Reserve, formed in 1912 and also with 
affection called The Fed, are probably the best known central banks. But all 
countries have one, some quite new, and others having a life that stretches 
back in time.

Business Journalism
127
A central bank is an institution that manages a state’s monetary policy, which 
includes currency, money supply, and interest rates. In some countries they 
have responsibility for the commercial banking system. The central banks can 
increase the money supply, in some countries even printing the banknotes of 
the nation’s currency. Usually the Bank sets a policy that promotes economic 
growth and stability.
In most of the developed economies, the central bank is independent from 
the government and is run by a type of chief executive usually known as a 
governor.
The big central banks are very cautious and usually signal to the financial com-
munity if they are about to make a significant change, even a small percentage 
point, in interest rates.
Economic analysts at major commercial banks and brokerages keep a very 
careful eye on interest rates and generally there is a consensus among them 
before an announcement is made about whether rates will rise, fall, or stay 
static and by what percentage. Mostly they are correct, and journalists will 
have a fair idea about the probability of an interest rate change.
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, which meets monthly, 
announces its decision following its meeting, always on a Thursday and always 
at noon. The Bank has a diary of meeting dates on its web pages. It alerts 
financial newswire services and simultaneously puts the decision on its own 
web pages.
In Washington, The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meets eight 
times a year but can increase that if any crises threaten the national economy 
and the Committee needs to take immediate action.
When central banks raise their prime rate, commercial banks do likewise and 
this in turn affects mortgage rates, car loans, business loans, and other con-
sumer loans; so the business journalist has a plethora of stories to file once an 
interest rate change is announced.
Reporting on Macroeconomics
Macroeconomics is usually reported by specialist journalists in the field who 
deal with government officials, bankers, trade organizations, and the bond 
market experts. As with most market sectors, there are analysts who follow 
each of the macroeconomic elements of the economy, and it is wise to get to 
know a few who can be helpful.
Often, especially in broadcast news, macroeconomics and microeconomics 
are treated as two separate worlds. PBS’s Morning and Nightly Business Reports 
were almost entirely focused on micro, while Reuters Financial Report was 
almost exclusively macro.

Of course there has to be a mix, but understanding the difference and focus-

ist reporter to whom all others turn.

Globalization 
and the 
Interdependence 
of Small 
Economies
Facts rarely, if ever, stand alone. Journalists must add the context that gives the 
facts meaning. Even the biggest events are rarely so big that journalists don’t 
have to start explaining immediately to their audience what their significance 
is. When countries elect new leaders, when countries go to war, or when 
major policies are adopted, journalists have to report the fact along with 
the explanation—that is, the global or local impact of such an event. Where 
business and economic news is concerned, this context often has to do with 
activity in neighboring economies. Reporting on these economies is the focus 
of this chapter.

Local Events Lead to Global Changes
Globalization can be as simple as a hurricane devastating a section of the 
coastline in the United States, but causing consumer goods prices in the 
United Kingdom to rise because of the storm’s affect on crops, buildings, 
transport, and other consequences of a natural disaster.
Of course there are more sophisticated examples, such as the world watching 
the outcome of an American presidential election, aware that the candidates 
have made a number of election promises connected to US trade or eco-
nomic policy. Depending on who wins, governments worldwide will need to 
review their trade dealings with the United States and adapt if necessary.
So events in one country will have an impact on another and nowhere more 
so than in the new economies of the Third World.
Note
■
■
  Because of modern communications, many such events will have an instant impact. 
Therefore, reporters need to be aware of what could happen as well as be able to react quickly to 
what does happen.
Business in Emerging Democracies
At one time, interaction was usually important only for business dealings 
in the major economies. But the collapse of the Soviet Empire, the emer-
gence of dozens of new democracies, and a steady shift in the economic 
power of nations big and small has made global business reporting impor-
tant to the world economic scene. A trade dispute in Belarus with Russia, 
for example, can affect the price of oil in France, which along with many 
other European countries is served by a pipeline that crosses Belarus from 
Russia.
Because Western governments have placed a good deal of political capital and 
huge amounts of funding into developing new democracies into open market 
economies, journalists need to be aware of any report on events in these 
countries, both as they affect each other but also as they affect the Western 
powers. So awareness of cross-border issues in the old Eastern Europe, the 
Balkans, and the Baltics, for example, is now a prime consideration for busi-
ness reporters in London and New York.
Slowly local newswire services are beginning to start up in some of the 
emerging democracies. But reporters there, as I have pointed out in other 
parts of the book, are not very experienced. This is not to belittle them; but 
it is not much more than 15 years ago that they were working in centrally 
planned economies, business was a dirty word, and commercial competition

was frowned on. It is not surprising then that they lack experience in report-
ing on business and economic affairs.
Nonetheless, their economies grow in importance year by year, and Western 
journalists need information from on the ground to be able to gauge what 
impact any of these given countries have on the global stage.
Many of these countries tend to be copycats. If one small country starts a priva-
tization program, the bordering state will start to do likewise. Inexperienced 
reporters often don’t see that a policy change has taken place and are left 
behind in reporting as important business stories begin to shape up.
There has been some effort by agencies such as the US Agency for International 
Development (USAID), the UN, Britain’s Foreign Office, and other Western 
countries to try to remedy the situation by funding training courses. But aid 
funds are limited, local media is still financially poor, and new local govern-
ments are still deeply suspicious of allowing media access to information.
A new breed of business journalist is needed in these countries, and perhaps 
Western media should be more proactive in trying to help develop business 
reporting skills there.
Whatever the solution, Western media needs business news from these 
regions as they mature into full open market economies.
Domestic News in a Global Economy
Globalization has made it impossible to see economic and business events 
just as domestic news. Workers cross borders, products are exported and 
imported, and companies seek markets elsewhere when they have done as 
much as they can in their domestic market. With capital mostly free to flow 
effortlessly around the world, one country’s interest rates or fiscal policy 
will have at least some effect if not great effect on investment decisions in 
other countries. For example, if the Slovenian central bank hikes interest rates, 
transportation costs in the country will rise. Slovenia is a key Balkan route for 
goods into the neighboring EU country Italy and therefore an important trade 
route. Higher costs of goods means lower profits, so investors would look 
very carefully before putting capital into Slovenian enterprises.
This is especially the case in small countries such as Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo, 
Armenia, Georgia, and some of the smaller African states. They will almost 
certainly lack the productive capacity to manufacture or grow everything that 
consumers need or want. Conversely, those who are efficient at producing or 
manufacturing will almost certainly want at some point to become a supplier 
of their product to other countries.

Chapter 15 | Globalization and the Interdependence of Small Economies
132
Journalists therefore need to look beyond their own beats and countries for 
news. By widening their view, they also will be able to identify stories that they 
had not previously considered.
What Journalists Need to Know in a Global 
Economy
Beginning with economic activity, journalists within these smaller countries 
should know where and how their country trades with other countries, espe-
cially their neighbors. For example
Who are the most important trading partners?
• 
Where are those trading partners located?
• 
What products is a country able to export?
• 
What products does a country need to import?
• 
Are there government policies that encourage or dis-
• 
courage exports or imports to or from certain places or 
involving certain products?
Like corruption, trade barriers generally lead to economic inefficiency. That 
doesn’t mean that governments don’t have good reasons for adopting them; 
but when they do adopt them, there is likely to be some cost: identifying that 
cost and who is paying it can make for good economic stories.
To some extent policy makers generally coordinate their actions with the 
actions of key trading partners—or they should. If they don’t, they run the risk 
of making decisions that are undermined or weakened by a trading partner. To 
give a straightforward example, there is no point in raising taxes on specific 
goods if consumers will simply drive across the border and buy them at a 
cheaper price. Business and economic activity is full of similar cases.
At the level of policy making, officials can also be measured against their coun-
terparts in other countries. International investors are almost certainly doing 
this and journalists should be doing it as well. For example
Why does one country attract more foreign investment 
• 
than another?
Is policy part of the explanation?
• 
Why does a business make more money manufacturing a 
• 
product in one country than in a neighboring one?
Are business costs too high?
• 

Business Journalism
133
Such questions, of course, go well beyond just government policy. Journalists 
should be attuned to such issues and look for opportunities to explain. The 
general level of education, for example, may make it more appealing to open 
a factory in one country than another, or even in one region of a single 
country than another. Union and other labor practices can have a similar 
effect.
Note
■
■
  Journalists should note that what is true of governments and policy is also true of 
businesses and often of labor. Company managers have to be aware of opportunities to cut costs by 
producing elsewhere or to boost sales by opening sales offices elsewhere. And when one company 
does it, all its competitors have to decide whether they should be taking similar steps.
The Relevance of Globalization
Business and economics and capital don’t stand still. Relative advantages and 
disadvantages are constantly shifting, sometimes in very short periods of time. 
The attraction of depositing money in any specific country can disappear 
overnight if another country raises interest rates. One country’s government 
debt may become much easier or harder to sell if another country’s govern-
ment debt rating is changed for the worse or better.
Behind the scenes, as all this activity is taking place, pressure is being put on 
governments, policy makers, company managers, labor leaders, and others to 
be flexible. Businesses may face many of these challenges, but they don’t nec-
essarily like it and won’t be shy about asking the government to protect them. 
Labor leaders, seeing a risk to jobs, may become more accommodating in 
negotiations or they may seek legislation to protect those jobs. Policy makers 
have to be responsive to political pressure even when that leads to decisions 
that are economically shortsighted or just wrong.
Journalists both benefit and suffer from this reality. The benefit is that it 
offers a wide range of stories to be written or broadcast. When they start 
looking at their own domestic environment in comparison to other coun-
tries where things work differently, they suddenly see stories that they 
hadn’t considered before. The suffering comes from the need for journalists 
themselves to become much more knowledgeable about things they previ-
ously ignored.

Chapter 15 | Globalization and the Interdependence of Small Economies
134
A MENTAL EXERCISE
Some experienced journalists sharpen their skills by playing a game with themselves. 
Imagine being caught on a plane with a government official, or a central banker, or even 
a company executive from another country. What questions would they ask? By going 
through this mental exercise of formulating questions for officials and executives from 
other countries, they develop a better understanding of the relevance of globalization to 
their own country. And hopefully they get more and better stories.
Foreign Affairs and Their Consequences Make 
for a Good Story
As an example of foreign affairs and their consequences, consider one Balkan 
country, which has a real problem in the diplomatic community. Often, its dip-
lomatic personnel are left off guest lists of receptions held by other embassies, 
where serious trade business is often conceived, because a larger neighbor 
refuses to be present if they are there.
In this case, the larger neighbor is trying to become a member of the EU. 
Obviously, concern for its citizens’ welfare takes a back seat to traditional 
enmities. Thereby lies a tale in itself.
But often the governments of emerging economies can be a bit self-centered 
about their own policies based on a desire to play the big stage before using a 
smaller platform to boost their economy and standing.
There is a wine in the Balkan states that wins rave reviews from critics. The 
producers make great efforts to place this wine in overseas embassies and 
consulates. Small producers have joined forces to try and get an overseas 
market. Yet their government is so busy trying to stride the big global stage 
that there has been little or no help for these wine producers to launch their 
product abroad.

  As you will remember from earlier comments, wine was among my specialty subjects as 
a business journalist, so I admit that I have an ax to grind about this particular issue. Nonetheless,  
I have dug up enough facts to start either an enterprise or investigative story that can be brought to 
a conclusion with a bit more work.
But why haven’t the nation’s journalists picked up this particular ball and run 
with it? Your reaction might be that it is a small story, not too worthy of media 
attention. However, all stories are worthy of attention when they can produce 
useful information for readers.

135
But be that as it may, this is a region that has almost half of its labor force in 
agriculture, has an unemployment rate nudging 50%, a third of the population 
below the poverty line, and a trade gap of a couple of billion dollars. The grape 
they produce is very juicy, but to a business journalist, this economic data 
should be even juicier.
There are some very good stories to be investigated on the basis of these 
facts and an opportunity for enterprising business journalists to ask serious 
questions of their authorities about trade policy, economic policy, trade and 
industry issues, and a whole host more.
A Wealth of Potential Stories
I was training some journalists in London from these regions on one occasion 
and some of them complained that in the UK media, they could find little or 
no news about their own countries. Part of the answer was that there was 
little or no serious news about their countries in their own newspapers.
A good journalist only has to scratch the surface and a host of stories come 
bursting out. Lazy journalism, protocol journalism, fearful journalism: they have 
no place in the bag of tricks that a good, serious, and innovative reporter 
should have.
There are stories everywhere. Many of them are global stories, but interna-
tional stories often reflect conditions in your own country, so looking abroad 
is not such a bad way of helping to focus on domestic issues.
Look abroad. There’s a wealth of material for good solid business and eco-
nomic tales, which can also trigger home-based stories. It just takes a bit of 
effort, that’s all!
Key Points
Reporters must
Look beyond their own countries to put economic sto-
• 
ries in context.
Examine government policies carefully to see how they

affect prosperity or recession.
Look at business strategies to rate a company’s success 
• 
factor.

Stock and Bond 
Markets
Most major cities have stock exchanges, with the biggest located in New York, 
London, Tokyo, and Singapore. They are simply a market for buying and selling, 
like many of the street markets in London, especially the famous Portobello 
Road market in Notting Hill, where stall holders sell anything from a cabbage 
to an antique statue.
But the commodity in stock markets is company shares, the sale or trade of 
which is designed to raise capital for a company.
Business media is very important to the operation of stock markets. When 
companies are publicly owned—that is, when shares are held by investors 
outside the company—legislation demands full and open disclosure of finan-
cial information. Companies depend on media to report these accounts and 
information about enterprises to satisfy a shareholder’s (investor’s) legal right 
to know what is going on in the business. Of course, media reports are a 
transparent way of keeping everyone with a vested interest informed about 
company activities, especially financial information. So important is this rela-
tionship that the stock exchanges use the media to reveal sensitive com-
pany information that might affect a company’s share price. The exchanges 
announce the “news” at exactly the same time to all media to ensure no 
investor gets any financial advantage over another.
Shares, Stocks, and Bonds
Shares are also known as securities. Stocks are known as equity securities and 
bonds are known as debt securities.
16

Chapter 16 | Stock and Bond Markets
138
Stocks are traded on a stock exchange and in some ways are the glamour 
instruments of the financial markets because massive companies such as Ford, 
British Airways, IBM, and Google are traded there and they conjure up visions 
of products we can all touch and feel.
Bonds, or debt securities, are far less glamorous because they are on a “paper” 
market, a market where money is borrowed and lent. But it is a no less impor-
tant market, with an estimated value globally of more than $80 trillion.
Bonds reach into many avenues of business and finance, with numerous gov-
ernments raising cash through debt instruments such as the US Government’s 
Treasury Bonds.
Some bonds are traded through formal “exchanges,” but mostly bonds are 
bought and sold through brokers. Because of the size of the market, deals are 
mostly transacted between governments (and to a lesser extent big compa-
nies) and pension funds, banks, and mutual funds.
Local Events Spur International Market 
Consequences
Perhaps one of the lessons to be learned from the Julius Reuter story 
(described earlier in this book) is that events that are happening thousands 
of miles away can have an impact on what happens in local towns and cities. 
The business journalist must be aware of general international news and try 
to determine if events will have an impact on his or her local business, local 
community, and local citizenry.
As an example, in the mid 1990s a huge hurricane devastated the coast of 
the southeastern United States. Its power was terribly destructive. The first 
impact of that hurricane was that the citrus fruit crops of the area were 
destroyed, leading to a sharp jump in the global price of fruit such as oranges 
and lemons.
But the real international consequence that had an effect on millions of com-
munities was that insurance payouts for the damage ran into billions of dollars. 
Therefore the biggest global insurance market, Lloyds of London, was forced 
to increase insurance premiums. This in turn meant that the cost of insuring 
such things as freight ships and tankers increased, so the shipping lines had to 
increase their costs. Suddenly, because of an act of nature, world prices for 
basic commodities soared, and the cost of everyday items in shops across the 
globe rose sharply.
This of course added to inflationary fears, so governments had to act and 
capped inflation by increasing interest rates. And an increase in interest rates 
affects anyone who has a bank account, a mortgage, or has borrowed money

for any reason. As you can see, a local storm had far-reaching consequences 
on a huge number of individuals.
Note
■
■
  In fairness, even senior international business journalists didn’t at first pick up the enormity 
of the consequences of the storm. But it can be seen that being a business journalist needs in-depth 
thinking, in-depth skills, and an exceptional ability to try to see how major global events will affect the 
lives of ordinary people in their own area.
Stock Exchanges, Bond Markets, and Foreign 
Exchange Markets
Stock exchanges (or stock markets) are the most common markets, until 
quite recently marked by the hubbub, arm waving, and shouting of traders on 
the floor of the exchange, trading a variety of shares in a whole range of busi-
nesses with shares open for sale to the public. (These shares are known as 
financial instruments.) Other important markets are bond markets, trading in 
“debt,” and currency markets known as foreign exchanges (Forex). They deal 
in the trade of almost all national currencies such as dollars for sterling, euros 
for Japanese yen, or rubles for Nigerian naira.
The biggest financial exchanges are usually based in the biggest financial cen-
ters. New York is the most important stock exchange, followed by Tokyo, 
London, and the joint European exchange Euronext based in Amsterdam. 
Hong Kong and Shanghai are the important exchanges in Southeast Asia next 
to Tokyo.
The good business journalist will explore in depth the workings of the markets, 
which include the following:
Securities such as equity and stocks
• 
Commodities such as wheat, coffee, copper, or sugar
• 
Debt such as bonds, banknotes, or debentures
• 
Precious metals
• 
Oil/ petroleum
• 
And the more complex trading in derivatives, futures, 
• 
options, and swaps
Also, as noted, there is the foreign exchange market. Billions of dollars, pounds, 
euros, and other currencies change hands each day on foreign exchanges. This 
is a market dear to every traveler, tourist, and holidaymaker because it dic-
tates the value of money for shopping overseas on any particular day.

Chapter 16 | Stock and Bond Markets
140
But the major players in Forex are the central and commercial banks, hedge 
funds, securities exchanges, and institutional investors, which need to know 
the relative values of a currency for their trading activities. Perhaps the most 
significant difference between trading on Forex and other markets is that 
these trading centers stay open 24 hours a day.
Stock exchanges have a set trading day. For instance, The New York Stock 
Exchange has an opening and closing bell. But because floor trading has been 
taken over by electronic trading and because stock exchanges have mush-
roomed around the world, stocks are not far behind currencies in being 
traded continuously.
The best way to understand how these markets work is to report on them. 
But to do that, knowledge can be gained by spending time in a brokerage or 
commercial bank, getting to know staff economists and analysts, and asking 
them a thousand questions.
There are many books about trading and the various markets, and a new 
reporter might want to read up on how markets operate. But like journalism 
itself, the best way is to “do it” and gain firsthand knowledge from a working 
expert. Try to establish a good relationship with an economist or trader. Talk 
to him or her and use these analysts as useful tools. They don’t mind and 
much prefer to help journalists understand the markets rather than get poor 
and inadequate stories.
These make up the financial markets and it behooves the competent business 
journalist to study them carefully and in some detail.
For the moment, I am examining stock and bond markets, as these are the 
staple items for most business reporters.
The Language of Financial Markets
Some terms used in financial markets can be confusing. So my exhortation to 
study these markets carefully should not go unheeded.
Briefly, a security is an asset that can be traded, on or off a formal exchange. 
These are also known as financial instruments.
Remember these two terms well: securities and financial instruments. While 
you are covering a story at a brokerage or bank, the chances are that the 
people you are talking to will lapse into jargon or market speak. They won’t 
know they are doing it. They will forget that you are a journalist, not a market 
expert, and often you will be too shy or awkward to ask just what the hell 
they are talking about.

Business Journalism
141
Don’t be shy in asking for an explanation. Mostly people in financial markets 
are only too happy to explain even the most rudimentary issues in clear lan-
guage, if asked. What they do get upset about is the reporter who uses “buzz 
words” such as “leverage” or “arbitrage” without having the faintest idea what 
those terms mean.
Note
■
■
  I reiterate, financial journalists must be accurate and that accuracy depends on being able 
to enter into an intelligent conversation about an issue without trying to prove you know everything.
The Role of Stock Markets
Stock markets (or stock exchanges) are in many countries an important 
measure of the economic health of businesses in those countries. And the 
economic health of businesses in any country is often a good indicator of 
the economic health of the country itself. A stock market is essential to the 
growth of businesses and to the creation of employment and wealth.
Businesses raise capital for expansion of their activities by selling new shares 
to a wide public via the stock market. The investors buying the shares need to 
know they can get their money back again in the future by selling the shares on 
the stock market. They will not buy the shares in the first place unless they are 
confident there is an efficient stock market where the shares will be traded 
and through which they can sell the shares in the future at a fair price.
So stock market activity produces at least two things that journalists need to 
report on:
The markets allocate capital both in the initial issuing of 
• 
shares by a company and in subsequent trading of those 
shares.
The markets offer an opportunity for investors of all 
• 
types to demonstrate their views about the future pros-
pects of companies by buying shares in companies they 
think will make good profits.
In some cases, stock markets serve other purposes. For example, in many 
emerging economies, governments use privatizations to make shares available 
to citizens. The idea is often to get the citizens to start thinking about how to 
manage their own wealth and to prepare for their own future costs.
By ensuring that citizens can buy a large percentage of the shares in a priva-
tized company, the government hopes to create a share-owning culture that 
will be generally supportive of private enterprise.

Chapter 16 | Stock and Bond Markets
142
Regulation and Transparency in Stock Markets
Effective regulation of the stock market is crucial to all of the above. If the 
market seems to be working on behalf of a few, well-connected individuals, 
it will not be able to efficiently allocate capital. Many investors will be wary 
because of the risk of investing in something that doesn’t follow rules, and 
governments are unlikely to stimulate widespread interest in owning shares.
AN EXAMPLE OF SLOPPY REGULATION
A classic example of sloppy regulation came when Russia decided to opt for free market 
principles rather than a centrally controlled and planned economy in the early 90s. 
The government decided to give each citizen coupons, redeemable in shares in state 
enterprises as they were privatized.
A few dubious individuals immediately offered to buy these coupons from the general 
public, at much less than their true value; and as a result, instead of citizens owning the 
companies, a few oligarchs became very rich.
What’s more, when trading began on the Russian stock markets, the regulations were 
so lax that shares were sold many times over, so that ownership of a share meant 
nothing because several more people might, and often did, also own the same share. 
So a company that issues a thousand shares had 10,000 people owning them.
There was chaos for a number of years.
Journalists should therefore be well informed of the regulatory requirement 
in any given country and be able to draw comparisons to best practice else-
where. Transparency will be one of the key elements of good regulation. 
Listed companies should be required to release regular financial information 
about their performance and their risk, and they should be releasing it to 
everybody at the same time. If anybody is getting such information before 
others, then the market is working on behalf of the few against the interest 
of the many.
Transparency and other elements of good regulation add up to protection of 
shareholder rights. Shareholders own companies, and governments and regu-
lators should be protecting those rights. The rules by which shareholders can 
urge changes in management at a company or even by which they can vote 
should be clearly spelled out. Minority shareholders should have the same 
rights as majority shareholders. Boards of directors should be working for the 
shareholders rather than for the company management.
Even well-established stock markets often fall foul of the preceding rules, but 
their failure only emphasizes the importance of them.

Business Journalism
143
The Role of the Journalist Who Covers the 
Stock Market
In addition to regulation, journalists will usually be reporting on two aspects 
of market activity:
They will be covering the company as it seeks to list on 
• 
the exchange (issue shares for sale).
They will be covering the day-to-day trading that re-values 
• 
every listed company again and again as the trading day 
continues.
When a company lists for the first time, it is seeking to raise capital that might 
otherwise be going elsewhere: to other companies, into a loan, or real estate, 
to name just a few possibilities. Journalists will therefore want to tell their 
viewers and readers why the company wants the money and what the oppor-
tunities and risks are of buying its shares. To make their case for capital, the 
company should be releasing a detailed prospectus about its plans, challenges, 
opportunities, and so on. Such a prospectus will be a treasure chest of valu-
able information about the company and should allow the journalist to draw 
comparisons to other, similar companies.
Once listed, the company’s shares are constantly trading on the exchange—or 
they should be, if there is enough liquidity. Efficient exchanges require good 
liquidity, a term that essentially means there will always be a buyer for anybody 
who wants to sell his or her shares. The price of a company’s shares is always 
moving, a sign that the market never sets a final value on it: the value is always 
changing.
In this constant reassessment of what a company is worth, journalists have a 
chance to write stories about opportunities or threats to the individual com-
pany, to the sector it is in, to the economy generally, and even to the stock 
exchange itself.
Participants in the exchange, whether they are financial institutions or individ-
uals, are the sources for this constant assessment. Uncovering their motives in 
deciding to buy and sell is a big part of the task of any market journalist.
The reason in part is that many others in the market want to understand why 
others are making decisions. Market participants often move in packs. When 
one investor executes a trade, others simply follow. Within the market itself, 
therefore, there is an appetite for news that describes what is going on in 
the market. Outside investors will be just as interested in knowing what the 
professionals think.

Chapter 16 | Stock and Bond Markets
144
STOCK EXCHANGES ARE IN COMPETITION  
WITH EACH OTHER
In many countries, the exchange is itself a listed company whose shares can be bought 
and sold. The exchange will compete against another exchange in the same or a different 
country. Just as one company will compete against a rival making the same product, 
the exchange competes against rivals to list companies and to attract investors. Those 
exchanges that do best are themselves rewarded with a higher valuation by investors.
Note

  For exchanges to work well, they often need a professional infrastructure. Analysts emerge 
to scrutinize companies; brokers are established to sell shares to retail investors, and others; financial 
institutions open trading desks; companies establish investor relations’ staff; and of course journalists 
circulate the information that comes from all of them, as well as the companies themselves.
As I’ve stated previously, it is not my purpose in this book to go into great 
detail on what a reporter should consider in viewing the activities of stock 
exchanges. But they should examine the roles of regulators and market prac-
titioners worldwide to understand the most suitable models for their own 
countries in establishing successful stock markets; they must examine how 
stock exchanges work in emerging economies and be absolutely sure of the 
relationship between stock markets (and other financial and commodity mar-
kets for that matter) and media.
Fascinating stories can come from studying the building of a stock exchange 
system from the bottom up, including the evolution of computer trading and 
news distribution systems; the role of exchanges and development of Europe-
wide markets; as well as the role of the regulator, importance of transparency, 
and the proper dissemination of market information.
Reporters must also weigh the balancing by market practitioners of the needs 
of investors, quoted companies and the regulator, the role of authorized news 
services, and their relationship with the market and the regulator. Business 
journalists must also be sensitive to financial public relations and the links it 
provides to financial newswires, newspapers, and broadcasters.
The following are important points that a business reporter must look at in 
relation to stock and financial markets:
How modern markets have been built from scratch as

the 18th century
The economic benefits of stock markets

It is unfortunate that electronic trading has taken over from the “Open Outcry” 
in which traders would sometimes resort to fisticuffs on the trading floor to 
win an order. But just because the fierce competition between dealers and 
exchanges isn’t as obvious any more doesn’t mean that it has disappeared.
Stock markets are fascinating enterprises, trading billions of dollars worth of 
stock in any given day. Reporting on stocks means reporting on great industrial 
names and what they are doing to retain their competitive edge: Microsoft, 
Cunard, Shell, AT&T—romantic names in the industrial world.
By reporting on stock exchanges, reporters get to delve into the inner workings 
of these big listed companies, their trials and tribulations, their shareholder 
revolts, and their chief executives’ hiring and firing.
It’s an exciting world to be part of, and I would ask, “Could a business journal-
ist ask for anything more?”
Key Points
Companies depend on business media to report accounts 
• 
and information about enterprises to satisfy a sharehold-
er’s legal right to know what is going on in the business.
Journalists should be well informed of the regulatory 
• 
requirement in any given country and be able to draw 
comparisons to best practice elsewhere.
Movement on the stock exchange can give a reporter 
• 
clues to a company’s health.

The small town of Barkerville is located some 400 miles from the major city 
of Vancouver in the interior of the Canadian Province of British Columbia. 
Its itinerant population today is about 200; and it is essentially a tourist town 
with dance hall girls, a hanging judge, and historic buildings. Visitors can also 
pan for gold.
And that’s how Barkerville was born. A prospector named Billy Barker struck 
gold in 1860 and the inevitable gold rush began. Barkerville sprang from noth-
ing to a population of 5,000, making it a fairly large town in those days.
As so often happened when gold fever struck, early miners in Barkerville 
made a lot of money. But it was the real commodity merchants who made 
a killing, selling pound bags of flour for $1.25 (around $30 today) as well as 
beans, meat, and dried fruit at the same price.
Guess who got rich.

Today’s Gold Market
The romance surrounding gold has almost gone from the days when bandits 
robbed trains and remote wild western banks were held up by masked gun-
men on horseback.
Although gold is still popular for jewelry as an adornment, in market terms, it 
is bought mainly as a hedge against inflation: a bit dull. The romance that once 
surrounded this precious metal has largely disappeared, although romantics 
such as Ian Fleming get the adrenalin rushing through the veins with novels 
such as the James Bond “baddie” Goldfinger.
The gold market does still have its moments, however. In 2013, heavy selling 
took place without a solid explanation, and the market panicked. Everyone 
tried to sell their gold holdings, thus driving the price down.
But that is rare, and although this precious metal bears reporting on, it fails 
to replicate its exciting beginnings and is considered a stable commodity in 
modern markets.
Gold is still seen as solid backup to more volatile investments. Tough economic 
times see the sale of gold rise. In better economic times, buyers fall away to 
buy products with faster returns and the gold market settles down again into a 
less bountiful mood. Gold still captures the imagination, but reporters follow-
ing the market are more likely to see gold as an economic indicator than as an 
interesting commodity in itself. Nonetheless, gold is a rare precious metal that 
figures significantly in the commodity sector. It provides support to central 
banks and financial markets because of its rare and less volatile features.
Following gold on the market is really part of following a set of financial indica-
tors. It is more of a signpost than a driver. But journalists should track it nev-
ertheless because the major banks watch its price carefully to test the validity 
of what action they are considering to take in overall economic activity.
What Is a Commodity?
There are many kinds of commodities, but they are generally put into three 
main categories. These are energy, metals, and agriculture.
A commodity needs to be tradable—in other words, it must have substance 
so that it can be delivered, such as cocoa, wheat, or tin. A commodity must 
also have buyers—that is, it must be in demand, the factor that drives the price 
of commodities on the open market.
Stepping back in time for a moment and at the beginning of this book,  
I explained how Reuters became the information giant that it is today through 
its founder Julius Reuter setting the price of corn in London based on the

abundance or otherwise of wheat crops on the Russian Steppes and produc-
ing the information via carrier pigeons. This was an early example of how 
commodity prices were set by supply and demand.
Oil as a Commodity
At about the same time that Billy Barker was panning for gold, a much less 
heralded but perhaps much more significant event took place about 5,000 
miles away in Britain.
Coal was a hugely important commodity in the 19th century, mostly extracted 
from deep under the earth by hand from pits or mines. In 1847 a chemist 
named James Young invented a process for distilling paraffin from oil seepages 
at a mine, which he refined for using in miners’ lamps. The residue, thicker 
oil—known to this day as “crude”—he used for lubricating machinery. Two 
years later, Abraham Gesner in Canada made a similar discovery and called his 
product kerosene. These two men produced the fuel that today accounts for 
about 90 percent of the power needs of transport vehicles: refined oil.
OIL AS A LEADING COMMODITY
There are two basic forms of oil: crude oil, which is the black stuff that comes directly 
from the ground or under the sea, and petroleum, which is refined oil, popularly known 
as gas in the United States and petrol in the UK. Petroleum is extremely important to the 
global economy. For example, it comprises 40 percent of total energy consumption in 
the United States, and many other things are derived from petroleum, such as industrial 
chemicals and by-products. So black gold has replaced yellow shiny gold as one of the 
world's most important commodities.
Oil in the Headlines
While oil managed to get a relatively placid start in life, unlike gold, it is now 
known as “black gold.” In modern times, oil spawns news stories almost 
daily and most are far more dramatic than the stagecoach robber of the 
gold fever era.
Oil has instead given rise to pollution stories, as huge supertankers travel the 
world, carrying vast loads of oil. More often than is environmentally desirable, 
a tanker hits the rocks in bad weather, spilling its cargo and causing extensive 
damage to wildlife, natural environments, and communities of humankind who 
dwell on the coast. The Exxon Valdez disaster off the coast of Alaska was a 
major story in 1989, sending vast quantities of oil pouring onto the American 
coastline (some estimates put the figure at 11 million US gallons), and more 

Chapter 17 | Commodities and Other Exotic Financial Products
150
recently the very damaging 2010 BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in which 
almost five million barrels (210 million gallons) gushed into the sea and onto 
the shore, causing huge harm to the environment.
The Exxon Valdez disaster in turn triggered major insurance stories because 
these ships and their cargo are underwritten by the biggest insurance market 
in the world, Lloyd’s of London. Lloyd’s pays for many of its insurance activities 
through a vehicle called “names.” Names are groups of individuals who insure 
these ships through personal investment, tempted by large profits. The Valdez 
disaster saw Lloyds call in the “names” investments, bankrupting many wealthy 
people around the globe.
There are many other stories triggered by oil. Aircraft stories are a regular 
item, from helicopters transferring workers from oil rigs that are located way 
out to sea to the development of jet engines that reduce pollution of the 
atmosphere.
Piracy stories are numerous in which bandits from relatively lawless coun-
tries hijack tankers from small boats loaded with machine guns and hi-tech 
weaponry. Pipelines, which carry oil across vast distances, are a favorite with 
journalists because there is always some group or other tapping into the line 
and siphoning off the oil, or terrorists sabotaging a pipeline to try to wreck 
an economy.
Kidnappings, especially in the Niger Delta, take place by groups who hold 
workers, mostly foreign, for ransom and on some occasions they have exe-
cuted them. Then there are bitter disagreements between states such as 
Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia across which pipelines carry oil, for nonpayment 
of bills for both gas and oil.
Some historians say, and with some evidence, that wars such as the Iraq war 
to depose President Saddam Hussein are really wars about who controls oil 
reserves.
So the formerly placid oil provides journalists with many, many news stories, 
not all of them linked to the markets and economies.
Oil is a commodity that spawns specialist reporters. These scribes watch 
carefully for events that will send the price of oil surging either up or down. 
This volatility is most important to all economies. As oil prices rise, so do the 
prices of many industrial products. Manufacturing costs soar, transport costs 
jump, and even home heating becomes more expensive.
The price of oil can be dictated by oil-producing countries artificially driving 
up the price by cutting back on output. This can be as much for political rea-
sons as market forces. Producing countries have sometimes cut back on pro-
duction to weaken the economies of nations with whom they have a dispute. 
On other occasions, producers have put the brakes on falling prices because 
national income has dropped as a result of a glut of oil on world markets.

Business Journalism
151
The Struggle to Control Oil
Oil is also often the cause of power struggles, both military and economic—
and, hence, a cause for more stories on oil.
The top three oil-producing countries are Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United 
States. Of these, Middle Eastern countries have the lion’s share. Some 80 per-
cent of the world’s reserves are located in the Middle East.
Saudi Arabia has in the main been friendly to the West, but from time to time 
it caps its output, limiting the amount of oil it will pump from the ground at 
any one time, pushing up prices, and sending shivers through Western econo-
mies that are so dependent on the commodity.
Output is largely dictated through a Vienna-based organization known as 
OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and is measured 
in “barrels” per day. Formed in 1960 by five of the big oil exporters, OPEC 
now numbers 12 nations with a permanent secretariat in Austria.
OPEC meets regularly with the expressed purpose of keeping oil prices stable. 
Although this is largely true, oil prices have bounded up and down like a yo-yo 
over the years. It is largely because Saudi Arabia is a key OPEC member that 
oil prices, although increasing steadily, have been kept relatively stable.
There are alternative sources of oil through extraction processes, for instance, 
from shale, a process known as “fracking” (hydraulic fracturing). But these are 
expensive processes, and the main source of oil is from drilling wells below 
the earth’s surface and pumping it out.
Britain and the United States also produce crude oil from under the sea from 
drilling stations called oil rigs.
THE PRICE OF GAS VERSUS THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL
Be careful not to tie the price of gasoline at the roadside pumping stations too tightly to the 
price of crude oil. Once crude oil has been pumped to the surface, it needs to be refined 
into petroleum. Many countries don’t have an extensive refining capacity and need to 
send crude abroad to be turned into fuel for motor vehicles. Weather vagaries, industrial 
disruptions, cartel combinations, and political events can diminish refining capacity. Hence 
the price of a gallon of gas often has little to do with the price of crude oil.
Petroleum is vital to many industries and is of major importance to the heav-
ily industrialized economies of the globe and thus a critical concern to many 
nations. According to the International Energy Agency, the world at large con-
sumes more than 30 billion barrels of oil per year, and the top oil consumers 
largely consist of developed nations.

Chapter 17 | Commodities and Other Exotic Financial Products

Oil Trading
Oil is traded on two major exchanges: the London-based International 
Petroleum Exchange, now known as ICE Futures, and NYMEX, the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, which also deals in a wide range of other commodities 
from coffee to iron ore. ICE has also expanded its range of products, dealing 
in swaps and futures. One other important commodities exchange is Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. This exchange leans more toward agricultural products 
but has spread its wings to become an important international enterprise.
Precious Metals as a Commodity
I now go back to real gold. Gold and precious metals are traded on similar 
exchanges. In London, the London Metals Exchange is the major player, closely 
followed by NYMEX in New York, Zurich in Switzerland, and the ancient trad-
ing location of Hong Kong.
The silver market is interesting because of extrinsic factors that may drive 
it. Silver prices can be affected by drought or crop blight in tea- or cotton-
producing countries, especially India. India traditionally uses silver for gifts and 
jewelry at times of national celebrations. If the cotton or tea crop fails (which 
are commodities in themselves), workers have no money to purchase these 
items and so demand slumps.
Journalists should watch out for this sort of factor, which can be a different, 
if unexpected, element in the global precious metals market. Interesting com-
modity stories are made of such.
The Diamond Market
One last market that is exciting is the diamond market.
Diamonds are still a “girl’s best friend” and are bought for cosmetic purposes. 
But there is also an industrial diamond used in drilling ventures because it is 
hard and almost indestructible.
There are a number of centers in the world that “cut and polish” diamonds, 
making them the attractive commodity favored by the human race. Producing 
more than half the “cut diamond” global output, the Belgian city of Antwerp is 
the acclaimed diamond capital of the world, closely followed by Amsterdam.
There is a huge supply of diamonds in the world, but the supply is carefully 
controlled by major companies such as the South African mining enterprise 
DeBeers. Russian supplies come second in volume.
There has been a big trade in diamonds on the black market, especially from 
countries in Africa suffering social and political upheaval.

Business Journalism
153
To ensure this supply of diamonds didn’t rock the market, the main producers 
formed the International Diamond Council, which has the task of trying to 
lessen the impact of “conflict diamonds.”
But whenever conflict breaks out in diamond-producing countries, business 
journalists should pay attention to the size of the conflict and the production 
figures for diamonds. Either the market will be flooded because “rebels” seize 
mines to raise funds, or the market rises because legitimate governments jeal-
ously protect their source of income.
Agriculture
Agricultural products are also an important commodity. An estimated  
40 percent of the world’s surface is used to grow crops and feed livestock. 
Products such as grains (wheat, oats, barley), soybeans, oilseeds, livestock, 
dairy products, lumber, coffee, sugar, and cocoa all fall under the agricultural 
commodities banner.
According to the International Labour Organization, more than one billion 
people are involved in global agriculture. And steadily increasing world popula-
tions continue to push the demand for food upward.
Agriculture gives rise to a wide variety of stories: famine, hunger riots, and 
plant and animal diseases. More recently, the development of genetically modi-
fied foods (super foods) has become a controversial topic, with many scien-
tists arguing these foods can safely ease starvation; while opponents, which 
are often governments, fearing these modified crops can be harmful to the 
human body: another great source of stories.
Those reporters who prefer to follow companies on the stock exchange will 
also reap benefits from these diverse views, as production and sales of new 
fertilizers and pesticides improves company share prices, while the fate of 
major chemical companies such as Monsanto, Syngenta, and Bayer, the main 
producers of genetic foods, fight off the critics of their products and try to 
achieve both acceptance and increases in sales.
Agriculture also triggers environmental stories, as farmers cut into rain for-
ests to increase growing capacity while animal welfare organizations fight to 
protect endangered species such as lions, tigers, leopards, and bears.
Reporting on Commodities
All those commodities—oil, gold, silver, and diamonds—have a glamour and 
excitement about them that makes reporting on them glamorous in itself.

Chapter 17 | Commodities and Other Exotic Financial Products

Now comes the tricky part for business and financial journalists: steering one’s 
way through the other exotic financial instruments. To combat this, I followed 
my own advice and maintained close contact with a market expert whom I 
regularly called for help when the word derivative cropped up.
Derivatives embrace market trading methods known as futures contracts, swaps, 
and exchange-traded commodities—all traded on commodities exchanges. 
Futures or forward contracts are probably the easiest to understand.
A forward or futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy a 
commodity at a price fixed at the time of the deal but to be paid at some time 
in the future. The buyer and seller are to all intents and purposes guessing 
that the price of the commodity will be either greater or smaller than when 
the transaction actually takes place. The practice of hedging is associated with 
these deals, enabling a buyer to trade in the same commodity at a different 
price or cut his or her losses if the futures contract goes wrong. For example, 
wheat traders might hedge against a poor harvest by agreeing to buy or sell 
wheat elsewhere at a lower price.
Swaps are a similar type of deal in which cash is the commodity. Used widely 
in the bond market, a dealer might agree to swap the interest paid on a bond 
for its market price, but again as a future trade.
Traders find these concepts simple; journalists in the main don’t. So my advice 
remains: ask a person who knows or even take a course in this kind of trading. 
It is hard to understand but easy to get wrong, something no financial journal-
ist can afford to do.
Key Points
A commodities exchange is an exchange where various 
• 
commodities and derivatives are traded.
Most commodity markets across the world trade in agri-
• 
cultural products and other raw materials and contracts 
based on them.
Oil and other commodities can give rise to many differ-
• 
ent types of stories. Watch these commodities carefully—
especially oil.
Ask an expert about derivatives. Analysts and traders 
• 
think they’re simple. I do not!

Investigating 
Company 
Accounts and 
Assessing the 
Board
Successful businesses become and remain successful mainly because they have 
a board of directors who are knowledgeable, honest, and hardworking.
A director’s main responsibility is to the company shareholders and employ-
ees. In this capacity, a director is required by law to keep company records, file 
them regularly with the tax authorities, and follow the legal trading require-
ments of the country or countries in which the enterprise does business. 
A board of directors, jointly and severally, must make sure the company’s 
accounts are a “true and fair view” of the business’s finances.
To fulfill these obligations, directors draw up annual accounts, which are a profile 
of a company’s financial health, profitable undertakings, and honest dealings.

Chapter 18 | Investigating Company Accounts and Assessing the Board
156
Business journalists who have even an elementary understanding of the role 
of directors and can review a set of accounts have a signpost to stories about 
business success and growth; malpractice, such as corrupt activities; labor 
relations—good or otherwise; and indications about how well a business is 
handling the speed of change in the modern world.
These make for vital and exciting stories for every member and sector 
of society.
Reviewing a Company’s Annual Accounts
In most Western countries, company annual accounts are filed with a regula-
tor. The rules and regulations can be quite complicated, but the requirement is 
that basic information be available to the public on such things as ownership, 
location, trading features, and so forth.
All registered companies—that is, limited liability companies—need to file 
annual returns. A set of company accounts must be filed with the returns. But 
unlimited partnerships and sole traders, while obliged to file a return, do not 
have to file an audited set of accounts. So if a company is a company protected 
by law as a limited liability business, it must produce annual accounts according 
to local law and make them available to the public.
But how can journalists tell if the accounts are reliable and accurate? In 
looking at the accounts of any company, large or small, journalists should 
first look to see if those accounts have been audited and what the auditor’s 
review says.
HOW TO ACCESS ANNUAL ACCOUNTS
In the UK, journalists can get the accounts of almost all companies trading in the 
country through a government agency called Companies House. For a small fee, details 
are available of a company’s accounts audited and registered by the company, usually 
through its accountants. All of this information is accessible to the public for a fee of £1 
per document.
In the United States, there are two similar organizations. One is the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which oversees the audits of public companies; 
and the other is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is more of a 
watchdog and oversees the key players in the securities world, including exchanges, 
brokers, dealers, investment advisors, and mutual funds. The SEC is “concerned primarily 
with promoting the disclosure of important market-related information, maintaining fair 
dealing, and protecting against fraud.”

Business Journalism
157
The annual accounts should contain, at minimum, a balance sheet and a profit 
and loss statement. The balance sheet shows what assets and liabilities the 
company has and where the money came from to finance them. Major enter-
prises usually publish an annual report, which gives a descriptive account of 
the activities of a company in its previous year of trading. This report contains 
the annual accounts.
Beware of using such information when trying to discover how successful or 
otherwise a company is in an emerging economy. The rules and regulations 
are often not as rigid as those in the West, and it’s possible for a company to 
cover up its true status more easily than if it was being examined by Western 
standards. In fact, the European Union has set regulatory reform as one of the 
conditions for gaining EU membership, and the United States has made the 
same demand of countries to which it donates substantial funds. But in some 
economies, progress is slow.
Understanding the Balance Sheet
Don’t be afraid of balance sheets. You don’t have to be an accountant to 
read one and get important information from it. (You might need to be an 
accountant to draw one up, but that’s a different story!) As long as you have a 
reasonable level of skill in arithmetic, you should be OK.
A balance sheet is simply a statement of what a company owns and owes at the 
point the accounts were prepared. It is just an evaluation put into black and 
white of a company’s worth. It lists the net worth of a company—all it owns, 
known as assets, and everything it owes, called liabilities.
Note
■
■
  A sample balance sheet is given in the Appendix.
You will recall that I cautioned at the beginning of this book that the golden 
rule is that there is no golden rule. So there is a little glitch in this description 
of a company’s accounts that a journalist needs to be aware of.
Liabilities can be called a credit because a loan, which will appear under liabili-
ties, can be treated as a cash input. This is accountant-speak, but just be on 
your guard that you don’t get fooled when interpreting a balance sheet.
A balance sheet is called a balance sheet because both sides must “balance.” 
Assets must equal liabilities plus equity.
The information will reveal a company’s income, its cash flow, and how much 
shareholders have contributed to the company, called shareholders’ equity. To 
reiterate, assets are things that a company owns that have value, liabilities are 
financial items that a company owes to others, and shareholders’ equity is the 

Chapter 18 | Investigating Company Accounts and Assessing the Board
158
money that would be left if a company sold all of its assets and paid off all of its 
liabilities. This last item is important when calculating the value of the earnings 
of each share in the company based on the latest balance sheet.
A company’s profit is generally stated as “pretax profit”—which means it still 
has to pay taxes, so the true profit has yet to be revealed.
As you review the balance sheet, be sure to watch out for notes attached to 
the accounts. These will give you hints about what stories to look for, because 
directors must reveal any items that may affect a company’s performance. For 
example, an airline might post a healthy profit, but the footnotes will reveal 
that the airplane fleet is aging and needs to be replaced. That item is costly and 
obviously will reflect on future profits.
Now that balance sheets no longer hold terror for you, it’s time to see what 
other information about a company you should look for.
What to Look for in Annual Accounts
The first thing to do when you get your hands on the annual accounts is 
to verify that the accounts have been fully audited and what the auditor’s 
opinion says.
Next, you need to ask the following questions about the company, whose 
answers can be found in the company’s various financial statements:
Is the company bankrupt or solvent? Look again at the balance sheet. The 
total assets should be greater than the total liabilities. If not, the company will 
not be able to carry on trading without an injection of more capital from its 
owners. The cash and receivables should be greater than the payables. If not, 
the company may not be able to pay its bills and will be forced to stop trading, 
unless it can borrow more money or get its owners to put in more capital.
How is the company funded? Some funding will be equity—capital put in 
when shares were issued plus retained profits from earlier years. Some will be 
long-term loans. If these loans are high in relation to equity, this could mean 
trouble in the future if trading and profits go down and the company cannot 
pay the loan interest.
Does the company have any loans? Low levels of long-term loans against 
equity reduce risk. Look for information about when loans will have to be 
repaid. If it is soon, will the company be able to make the repayments or to 
take out replacement loans?
Where does the company get its income? To understand a company’s  
business, look at where it gets its income. Consider the profit and loss  
statement and any notes on income to see if they give any breakdown by 
product, market, or country. Check to see if there is anything unusual about 

Business Journalism
159
the expenditure in the profit and loss statement and in any analysis of costs 
in the notes to the accounts. Do the costs relate to the activities described 
in the introduction and directors’ report? Are they reasonable in the light of 
the levels of income?
Does the company have a secure asset base with which to con-
tinue its operations? Consider what the business owns—look under the 
list of assets—and look at the age of these assets from the depreciation calcu-
lation. This will be in the notes to the accounts and will show how the costs of 
long-term or “fixed” assets have been spread over their expected life. You can 
see how much of the original cost has been allocated to past years’ income 
and expenditure statements. If this is a high percentage, it means the assets 
will need replacing soon. Will the company be able to raise the capital to buy 
the replacements and stay in business?
Do the assets, including property, relate to the business the  
company is carrying out? If the company owns assets that do not seem to 
be needed for the business, maybe they have been bought for the private use 
of the directors or other individuals.
Who is on the board of directors? Directors run the company and have a 
great deal of power over what it does—more so than the shareholders. Who 
are they? How much are they paid? Is it reasonable? Are they also directors 
of other companies that might be linked? Is any trading between companies 
with the same controlling directors on fair terms? Or is one company being 
deliberately favored?
How many months of revenue does the level of receivables represent? 
Revenue from trading is the lifeblood of a company, and sometimes directors 
are tempted to overstate it to exaggerate profits. Look at the level of receiv-
ables in relation to revenue. If this is higher than you would expect it to take 
to get customers to pay their invoices, is there a problem? Is the administra-
tion of the company failing to get prompt payment from customers, or is it 
possible the revenue is overstated? Will all these receivables get collected?
Who owns the company’s shares? Companies are often part of a group. 
Look to see if the company you are examining owns shares in other compa-
nies or if its shares are owned by another company. Who is really in control? 
If companies in the same group are trading with each other, is it on fair terms 
or are there any distortions?
Can you identify any trends in the report? Trends over time are very 
revealing. Compare figures in the accounts to the previous year, and look to 
see if anything has changed significantly. Is revenue rising or falling? Are costs 
rising or falling in step with revenue? Has there been any big investment in 
new assets? Have any new loans been taken out? What are the reasons for 
these changes?

Chapter 18 | Investigating Company Accounts and Assessing the Board
160
Is cash flow compatible with profit figures? Cash can be measured more 
accurately than profit, and it is harder to manipulate the reported figures. So it is 
a good idea to see if the cash flow and the profit figures look compatible. High 
profit and low cash flow could mean profits are overstated and vice versa.
Has the company made any loans? Companies can make loans to other 
companies or to individuals and this will show up as an asset or a receivable 
in the balance sheet. But apart from banks, this is an unusual thing to do. If you 
see such loans on the balance sheet, you should ask whether there is a good 
business reason for doing it.
How is the company using its profit? Profit provides dividends as a return on 
investment to shareholders, taxes to the government, and capital to reinvest in 
the business. It is a good idea to look at what is being done with the profit. Is 
a prudent level being retained in the business and is capital expenditure being 
made to sustain the business? Or is it all being distributed to the owners, put-
ting the future of the business at risk?
Understanding the Profit and Loss Statement
Next, look at the profit and loss statement, which shows the income and the 
expenditure for the latest financial year. It is compiled on an accruals basis. That 
means it takes in items that are owed to the company (receivables) or items 
the company owes to creditors (payables), even if the cash settlement has not 
yet been made.
Also, look to see how the company is funded. Some funding will be equity 
(capital put in when shares were issued, plus retained profits from earlier 
years). Other funding will come from long-term loans. If these loans are high in 
relation to equity, this could mean trouble in the future if trading and profits 
go down and the company cannot pay the loan interest. This information can 
be found in the balance sheet.
ANNUAL REPORTS
Another source of company accounts in both the UK and the United States is a 
company’s annual report, which is legally required from public companies and those 
listed on the stock exchange. Depending on the size of the company, these reports are 
usually glossy, well-produced documents that are sent to shareholders. Most companies 
make copies readily available to journalists. As noted, annual accounts are primarily 
bookkeeping, while annual reports are narrative.

What Journalists Need to Know about Boards 
of Directors
The board of directors is a group of people elected by the stockholders 
(the owners) to represent their interest and to protect the stockholders’ 
investment. The directors must also ensure that investors receive a decent 
return on their investment. Such are the guiding principles in Western open 
market economies.
But journalists covering emerging democracies should be aware that open-
market principles are still evolving and in some European countries, the reality 
is much different; directors often feel that it is their primary responsibility to 
protect the employees of a company first and the stockholders, or shareholders,  
second.
Note
■
■
  Government regulation on filing accounts in emerging democracies is sometimes not as 
rigid as those in London or New York. So care must be taken in looking at the accounts of companies 
in emerging democracies to ensure that the data reveals the whole story.
Usually, the board is made up of individuals. In most cases, directors have a 
vested interest in the company, work in upper management, or are business-
savvy independents.
Directors run the company and have a great deal of power over what it 
does—more so than the shareholders. Therefore, it is necessary for reporters 
to ask such questions as the following:
Who are the board members?
• 
How much are board members paid?
• 
Is the compensation reasonable?
• 
Are any board members also directors of other compa-
• 
nies that might be linked?
Is any trading between companies with the same control-
• 
ling directors on fair terms? Or is one company being 
deliberately favored?

THE NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
One class of director is known as a non-executive director (NED). This class of director 
is brought in because of expertise that might help a company’s operation. They are 
advisers rather than hands-on executives, but they have the same legal responsibilities 
as other directors and can be held responsible for any problems the company might 
have, especially financial or legal.
Asking such questions is essential to assessing the overall health of a company. 
For example, at the turn of the century, some executives and directors of the 
American energy company Enron were indicted on charges of poor financial 
reporting and concealing billions of dollars of company debt. They were found 
guilty in a district court, but the decision was later overturned.
More recently, controversy has erupted over the bonuses paid to senior 
executives of banks. This has been a massive debating point in many coun-
tries, but especially so in the key financial capitals of London and New York. 
The boards of many financial services companies have come under fire for 
awarding massive bonuses, usually a responsibility of the board. British bank 
Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, came under fire for awarding its chief 
executive Stephen Hester £2.2 million, which contrasted with the average pay 
of £34,000. The bank was taken into the public domain during the banking 
crisis of the late ’80s, when the government took an 80 percent stake to help 
prevent trading problems.  Lord Oakeshott, former Treasury Spokesman for 
UK Liberal Democratic Party, declared that bankers are “the best paid public 
sector workers by a mile, in a bank that keeps failing the public by failing to 
lend. Let’s end this nonsense and nationalise RBS now.”
Revenue from trading is the lifeblood of a company, and sometimes directors 
are tempted to overstate it to exaggerate profits. Look at the level of receiv-
ables in relation to revenue. How many months of revenue do the level of 
receivables represent? If this is higher than you would expect it to take to get 
customers to pay their invoices, is there a problem? Is the administration of 
the company failing to get prompt payment from customers, or is it possible 
the revenue is overstated? Will all these receivables get collected?
Trends over time are very revealing. Compare figures in the accounts to the 
previous year, and look to see if anything has changed significantly. Consider 
the following:
Is revenue rising or falling?
• 
Are costs rising or falling in step with revenue?
• 
Has there been any big investment in new assets?
• 
Have any new loans been taken out?
• 
What are the reasons for these changes?
•

Cash can be measured more accurately than profit, and it is harder to 
manipulate the reported figures. So it is a good idea to see if the cash flow 
and the profit figures look compatible. High profit and low cash flow could 
mean profits are overstated and vice versa.
Covering Annual Meetings
One small note of caution: In my early days of business journalism, I couldn’t 
get out of my head that investors were individuals, people such as me who had 
put a few pounds or dollars into buying some shares in a big company.
Don’t ever fall into that trap.
When writing about or researching investors, remember that for big companies, 
the investors are big. They are mutual funds, banks, insurance companies, and 
other major organizations that can own thousands and thousands of shares.
Although the board can be in control of the company, major investors can 
bring huge influence to bear; and annual general meetings (AGMs) can some-
times be uncomfortable meeting places for directors if a major investor, with 
a big block of voting stock, is upset with their performance.
AGMs to which journalists are allowed access (there is no legal obligation on 
a company to grant access to reporters) can be very interesting occasions, full 
of conflict and controversy—that is, they are a wealth of potential stories. It’s 
worth covering at least one AGM of a major company in your career.
In the end, keep in mind that no single financial statement or annual meeting 
will tell the complete story about a company’s performance or even viability. 
But, taken in context with other information, it can provide a very powerful 
information source for financial journalists and produce data, which is the 
reporter’s best tool when it comes to writing an in-depth and accurate story 
about any company, big or small.
Watching and analyzing the activities of companies, especially medium-to-large 
enterprises, from balance sheet to activities of the directors, can paint a story 
worth telling—a story that can detail information that would not be evident 
to a member of the public who can’t delve into a company’s background in 
quite the way that a business journalist can.

Privatization
For more than thirty years, governments in Europe have been privatizing more 
and more of the activities that were previously done by the state. Eastern Europe 
joined this trend in the early 1990s and generally continues it today, despite 
exceptions in some countries and sectors. The United States has privatized a 
small number of state-owned enterprises in the transport and finance sector, 
and various US states have sold off utilities such as water and electricity.
But while privatization is often hotly debated by American politicians as a policy, 
American government sell-offs are drops in the bucket compared to the 130 
or so enterprises sold by the UK over three decades or the French privatization 
program, which saw more than 50 enterprises privatized since 1990.
Part of the reason that there is a sharp difference in privatization program 
between the United States and other Western economies is the open-market 
philosophy. The United States has led the world in the policy of allowing pri-
vate ownership, while governments in France, Britain, and other parts of Europe 
nationalized a wide range of companies in the last century and maintained 
control well into the 1990s. In Russia, even after perestroika and President 
Boris Yeltsin’s market reform program, many state enterprises continued to be 
owned and operated by the state.
So what do these trends mean for business journalism? Why should privatiza-
tion take place? What are the pros and cons of government ownership and 
private-sector ownership?
What Privatization Means for the  
Business Journalist
Business journalists need to understand the differences between an open 
market economy and a controlled or centrally planned economy.
19
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 19 | Privatization
166
The United States is the exemplar of open market policies and philosophies 
promulgating the ideal of economic systems with no barriers to market  
trading. Such systems are marked by low trade tariffs and taxation, few licensing  
regulations, and limitations on trade union or workers association interference  
in trade.
The financial and social collapse of the former Soviet Union gave huge impetus 
to Eastern European states to follow the American model, and broadly that is 
what has happened.
North Korea, on the other end, is the epitome of a closed market, with  
massive state control over business dealings, few if any businesses privately 
owned, and government managing industry.
So business journalists need to look at privatization in different ways 
depending on the market policies adopted in different countries. The open 
market is quite clear in the United States, in Britain, and other Western 
European countries; but in the old Eastern Europe, it is not quite so devel-
oped and governments are busy selling off their state enterprises as they 
try to transform their closed economies into an open market.
The Advantages of Privatization
Often, government ownership means business decisions are made for political 
purposes, such as job protection. This setup puts government officials in charge 
of reconciling conflicting interests when, usually, they are the least qualified to 
do so.
Although some experts would argue that there are merits to centrally planned 
and controlled economies in some countries at certain stages of development, 
generally private sector ownership brings greater economic flexibility, innovation, 
investment in machinery and in people, and economic growth.
For governments, the advantages of privatization are numerous. Privatization 
delivers income to the government from the sale of state enterprises and from 
future taxes paid by that enterprise, with which the government can pay for 
other public goods and services. Privatization moreover increases the chances 
that the privatized company will respond to market needs rather than politi-
cal ones. It also ensures that private sector managers and shareholders carry 
some of the blame if things go wrong, and thereby reduces political pressures 
on the government. A final benefit is that it often allows governments to help 
create a shareholder culture among their citizens.

Business Journalism
167
The Disadvantages of Privatization
While there are considerable merits to privatization, there are also draw-
backs. In the case of selling utilities, for example, governments have tended to 
offload enterprises that were monopolies, such as water. The prime purpose, 
which was to raise funds for the government, was met. But because the utility 
was a monopoly, the advantage of lower prices and competition was lost. The 
utility could do what it liked; and since its remit was to make a profit, prices 
were uncapped, which lead to much more expensive products.
Because privatized companies are sold in an open-market environment, there 
is no curb on who could buy them. Several enterprises in the UK have been 
snapped up by overseas bidders, who have no national interest or community 
welfare program at the core of their objectives. They simply want to make as 
much profit for shareholders as possible, so public interest is a low priority.
A privatized company almost always has new management. Managers of state-run 
companies generally have different objectives, such as ensuring customers can 
buy the product at a reasonable price—one that won't embarrass the govern-
ment, no matter what it costs to produce.
New management also needs to implement efficient work practices, which often 
means reducing the workforce. So unemployment becomes a by-product.
For example, in the UK, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher undertook a massive 
program of privatization of state industries in the 1980s. Her successor, John 
Major, carried on that policy and set about selling off one of the last big state-
owned companies, the railway system, in 1993. The railway system needed 
massive investment for modernization and proponents of privatization hailed 
a new era of railway efficiency when the government introduced legislation to 
sell off British Rail.
Supporters of the plan claimed, among other things, that privatization would 
bring improved customer service; but this aim failed to materialize in the 
early years because the new owners miscalculated a voluntary redundancy 
program for drivers, who left the privatized service in droves. Trains had to 
be canceled, fares were increased, and the service was deemed far worse than 
when under state control. There were also some railway accidents, including 
one that was especially serious and sapped public confidence. Critics accused 
the rail companies of skimping on safety to increase profits.
Alarmed at public hostility to the privatization, the government intervened 
on how much the companies could charge for fares and how they scheduled 
their train timetables.
The privatization process was beginning to unravel.

Chapter 19 | Privatization
168
The main incentive to any buyout is to make a state industry profitable, and 
this was looking increasingly difficult for the investing enterprises. The critics 
seemed to be right. But over a couple of decades, slower than anticipated at 
the time of privatization, the rate of fare increases became slower than under 
state control, many more trains were scheduled each day, and stations had 
been renovated on most routes and new trains (rolling stock) purchased. 
Investment in rolling stock was largely based on revenue, so carriages were 
smaller; passengers were made to stand for long journeys, and cancellation of 
services became commonplace. But punctuality did not largely improve and, 
although passenger numbers did increase, other means of transport siphoned 
off some travelers from the railways.
So privatization in this instance has been a two-edged sword. But there is a 
consensus of thought that if the railway had been left in government hands, it 
would have been starved of investment cash, especially in times of economic 
downturns—of which there have been many in recent times—and the railways  
would have suffered under state control.
Hostility toward Privatization
In many countries, hostility to privatization is endemic in government itself. 
Politicians only introduce privatization to attract foreign government donor 
funds or to gain membership to political entities such as the European Union. 
So it is necessary for business journalists to watch the process carefully.
In Bosnia, for example, the government planned to sell off one of its tobacco 
factories. There was widespread international interest, as the factory had a 
healthy balance sheet and it was potentially a good buy.
But the Prime Minister had staked his reputation on demanding that any sell-off, 
a very unpopular move in the country, would ensure that extra jobs for workers 
would be part of the deal. As a consequence, he tied a condition to the sale 
that required the buyer to build a luxury hotel in a remote area where it was 
very unlikely the hotel would generate business. This was his idea for placating 
critics of privatization. The one buyer who showed interest in the tobacco 
plant was unwilling to invest in a white elephant and the sale fell through.
The initial loss of jobs that would have been lost at privatization would 
probably have been redressed with increased output from the facility, but 
government was unwilling to risk that.

Business Journalism
169
The Role of the Press in Privatization
The press’s role is as a guardian of an effective process—keeping privatizations 
transparent and honest and ensuring the government is demanding the best 
terms and getting them.
To be efficient in this role, journalists need to tap sources of information 
and understanding from the full spectrum of experts and stakeholders:  
government officials, investment bankers, lawyers, tax advisers, equity analysts, 
economists, consultants, “good-government” advocates, embassies, businessmen, 
competitors, and workers.
There are thousands of questions that journalists can—and should—ask about 
privatization. Some of them include
What is the government’s privatization schedule?
• 
Who are the government’s advisers?
• 
What is the value of the assets of the enterprise and 
• 
what are its liabilities?
How do those assets compare to others in the same 
• 
business, either in the public or the private sector?
Is it possible to actually view the assets that are listed,  
• 
in the case of a factory—for example, its plant and 
machinery or delivery fleet?
Are the assets shrinking in value over the course of the 
• 
privatization?
Do all bidders have access to the same information?
• 
Is there a prospectus? (A 
• 
prospectus is a document for 
potential investors that outlines the company’s business, 
includes financial statements, biographies of officers and 
directors, their remuneration, and a list of assets.)
What does the prospectus warn about?
• 
Who wins and who loses in the privatization?
• 
Are the bidders related to government officials in any way?
• 
Are bids open to the public?
• 
What can bidders offer besides the purchase price?
• 
Did the government set realistic objectives? Did it achieve 
• 
them?
Just as there are thousands of questions that can be asked about privatization, 
there are almost as many stories to be written.

Chapter 19 | Privatization

Covering the Private Sector
Capital is finite, for the private sector and for the government. If the govern-
ment owns all the economic activity, it will struggle to make choices about 
whether to invest more into education or airlines, more into wages or research, 
and so on. By privatizing many businesses, the government lets consumers and 
producers make these choices based on supply and demand.
Journalists who have reported on state monopolies and centrally planned 
economies should get used to covering the private sector differently. For 
example, when British Airways was privatized, reporters had to switch their 
research and investigations by asking questions of company directors instead 
of government ministers. They needed to get their information from the com-
pany accounts and not the UK Treasury. They were required to report about 
an annual general meeting, with shareholders in attendance, sometimes asking 
awkward questions. So the whole approach to reporting on the privatized 
company shifted from dealing with government officials to approaching busi-
nesspeople and investors.
Businesses compete with one another. Decisions, therefore, have to be judged 
by their business rationale rather than by their political impact.
Simple actions like layoffs can make a great deal of business sense because 
they allow the company to compete more effectively in the market. If the 
company is owned by the government, such decisions are more likely to be 
weighed by the political impact of unemployed workers.
Businesses are primarily interested in profits; governments are primarily inter-
ested in elections. Businesses also carry out a fair number of functions that are 
beneficial to the economy as a whole. They train workers, invest in new capacity,  
advertise (thereby subsidizing entertainment), innovate, and much more.
So reporters need to view businesses sold off by the state from a whole new 
point of view.
Comparisons can be made between the performance of the new company 
and the achievements of the old:
Does the new company give better customer satisfaction 
• 
under open-market-style management than it did when it 
was government owned?
Have working conditions improved?
• 
Are targets being met?
• 
Has new equipment been installed?
• 
Are the new work practices benefiting employees?
• 
These are questions that can give rise to good stories, whatever the answers 
to such questions are.

Globally, governments are converting to open-market policies, which mean 
big sell-off programs of state assets. There is no guarantee that this global 
trend of privatization sell-offs will improve industrial performance and public 
services, so it is up to good business reporters to tell the stories of its suc-
cesses and failures.
A Look at Balance Sheets
If journalists want to cover business activity, they need to speak the language 
of the businesses themselves. That means understanding company accounts, 
including balance sheets, cash-flow statements, and income statements. Balance 
sheets are in a sense devices to measure the general health of a business. The 
credit crisis that began in 2007 and has since spread around the world is 
largely a problem of balance sheets. Journalists who fail to understand them 
won’t be able to cover the crisis with any depth.
Terms
■
■
  As you’ve learned in previous chapters, the balance sheet measures what the company 
owns (the assets) and how it paid for those assets (the liabilities and the equity). The liabilities have 
to be paid back, with interest. The equity is the money raised by issuing shares. It is often called 
risk capital because the shareholders bear the risk if things go badly, and receive the benefits if 
things go well.
When journalists cover the privatization of a government-owned property, 
they should look at the balance sheet to assess how the company compares 
to others in the country and sector. One of the basic questions is whether 
the government is simply transferring existing shares to the public, or whether 
there will be a capital increase, that is, an effort to raise new funds from 
shareholders.
Journalists also need to ask whether the government will be selling a majority 
of the company and giving up control, or somehow keeping enough shares to 
block certain company decisions. Governments can maintain control even if 
they have a minority shareholding in some cases.
For example, airports in the United States, UK, and EU are popular invest-
ments in which the majority shareholding is private but where government 
retains a share. The rationale is that if private ownership fails, governments 
can step in to keep a vital transportation link working.
Private investors will almost certainly see additional risk if the government is 
maintaining control. It suggests the company and its managers will not be able 
to do some things because of market demands but will have to accommodate 
political considerations.

Chapter 19 | Privatization
172
Once privatized, the company’s balance sheet will to some extent determine 
how big it can grow, how much it will have to pay to borrow money, and 
even whether it is vulnerable to being bought by another company. Any given 
amount of equity is likely to limit how many assets a company can acquire. 
The company’s own lenders (providers of the cash that becomes a liability) 
will want to see a nice equity cushion in most cases before they are willing to 
commit funds.
The balance sheet is also where the company records its working capital: the 
short-term assets and liabilities that are needed on a daily basis to pay work-
ers, suppliers, and others and to extend credit to customers and others. The 
working capital management is a key responsibility of the executives and is 
often especially problematic in fast-growing companies.
Privatized companies will in most cases have to deal with either the capital 
markets or with lending institutions. Journalists should follow this interaction 
closely because that is where they will get a good sense of how others per-
ceive the company. In some cases, the stock market (for listed companies) is 
responding to decisions that have taken place between the company and its 
lenders or shareholders. Journalists need to see those connections.
A Focus on the Future
Investors in private companies, whether they provide debt or equity, also tend 
to be very focused on the future.
They rarely take time to look back at how a company did last year or in earlier 
years: their concern is to forecast how the company will do next year and in 
subsequent years and to invest accordingly. Journalists covering such compa-
nies therefore have to be constantly seeking the management’s view about 
the future, including its plans and worries, and its response to the dangers it 
anticipates.

about it in the same way that the company managers do.
Privatization Agencies
In countries that are moving from a closed to open-market economy, priva-
tization of state industries is usually managed by a quasi-government agency 
called a privatization agency. Privatization agencies usually aim to create an

173
open economy and ownership structure, maximize investment, achieve social 
and political acceptability, and establish clear ownership structures.
An example is the activities of the Serbian Privatization Agency, which over-
saw a relatively large sell-off of state assets: the state petroleum company, 
three major banks, the mobile telephone company, an airline, a hotel chain, and 
numerous other smaller state-owned industries.
Take a look at the benefits that accrued overall; the costs to government; 
the benefits and costs to investors; the benefits and costs to workers; and 
the benefits and costs to the company, its sector, and the broader economy. 
Which privatizations were successful? Which were worth investing in? Where 
are those companies now going?
This might seem an onerous and difficult exercise. But with a bit of research, it 
is possible to get a good feel for the privatization process, as Serbian companies 
have mostly now been sold. By applying some of the journalistic techniques 
outlined in this book, you can construct a good example of what privatiza-
tion can mean to a country aiming for a free-enterprise environment and the 
stumbling blocks it faces along the way.
Key Points
The business journalist needs to understand the key ele-
• 
ments and importance of privatization to report on the 
financial health of a company or of a sector.
It is necessary to have a basic understanding of company 
• 
accounts, including the balance sheet, and what they can 
say about a company.
Track important new companies on the stock exchange 
• 
to assess their success.

SMEs and  
the Economy
Global analysts and economic commentators all agree that one of the signifi-
cant characteristics of a flourishing and growing economy is a booming small 
and medium enterprise (SME) sector. 
The EU definition of an SME is an enterprise that has 250 employees or less, 
and an annual turnover of not more than €50 million. In the range below that 
medium enterprise cutoff, a micro enterprise is defined as one with between one 
and nine employees and a turnover of less than €2 million; and a small enter-
prise is defined as one with between 10 and 50 employees and a turnover of 
less than €10 million.
The US definition of an SME varies according to industry and type of business, 
with the number employees in a medium enterprise ranging up to 1,500 but 
usually capping out at 500; in a small enterprise, 250; and a micro enterprise, 6.
When you buy a paper from the local corner store or even buy a hot 
dog on a city street, you are therefore technically a customer of an SME. 
More typically, the term SME in business parlance connotes companies in 
the medium range—from textile companies to computer and electronics 
firms to orchards and vineyards.
Analysts who cover this sector, supported by data from UK, US and EU  
government departments, say that SMEs play an extremely important role in 
the economic development of a country and contribute to national wealth 
in various ways. Not only do SMEs create employment for both rural and 
urban labor forces, but also they provide sustainability and innovation in the 
economy as a whole.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 20 | SMEs and the Economy 
176
SMEs have an impact on income distribution, tax revenue, and employment, 
as well as on efficient utilization of resources and stability of family income. 
They also have a propensity to employ more labor-intensive production pro-
cesses than large enterprises. Consequently, they contribute significantly to 
the provision of employment opportunities, the generation of income, and the 
reduction of poverty.
The SME sector contains such a wide variety of industries, plays such an 
important role in economic development, and provides so many jobs globally, 
that business and economic reporters need to cover it closely.
SME companies are part of macroeconomics as a sector and of microeconom-
ics as small companies. Moreover, some SMEs grow to be large multinational 
corporations that are household names on the stock and bond markets, such 
as the examples in the sidebar. There is no greater thrill for a journalist than 
to find he has been reporting annually on a small enterprise that grows with 
each passing year until it blossoms into a listed company with wide-reaching 
international operations.
Reporting on SMEs is, however, mostly driven by the macroeconomic con-
sideration that they are a sector that is important to almost every national 
economy in the world.
FROM SME TO HOUSEHOLD NAME
Many large enterprises had their origins as small and medium enterprises, and in 
many economies SMEs are the starting point toward industrialization. To understand 
SMEs and their importance, journalists should take a look at the origins of many of 
today’s big companies.
There are dozens of examples of companies we know as household names today that 
began as SMEs. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Google all began as one to three guys 
in a garage; Vodafone was once a little spin-off from Racal; and Hewlett-Packard started 
in a little wood shack.
The Development of SMEs
The impact of SMEs is far reaching. According to the EU Annual Report 2012, 
an estimated 23 million SMEs in the EU provide around 87 million jobs. And 
more than two-thirds of all jobs in the EU are in SMEs—a proportion that is 
on the rise.
According to 2010 U.S. census data, there are roughly 21 million enterprises with 
between 1 and 500 employees, numbering 60 million employees in aggregate.

Business Journalism
177
In many economies, small and large firms are interlinked, which is crucial for 
the attraction of foreign investment. But to prosper, SMEs need a supportive 
business environment, adequate basic infrastructure services, access to short 
and long-term funding at reasonable rates, equity and venture capital, advisory 
assistance, and knowledge about market opportunities. They typically suffer 
from weak entrepreneurial skills and deficiencies in accounting, production 
management, and business planning.
So far, the international experience shows that very few government and 
donor initiatives have succeeded in implementing sustainable strategies for 
SME development in emerging economies. In fact, economic difficulty was far 
more of a spur to the development of SMEs, including one-person enterprises 
and small-scale businesses such as tea and coffee shops.
Nowadays it is widely deemed that a government’s role in the process should 
be limited to providing a sound environment for private sector development, 
correcting potential market failures, and creating a level playing field that will 
allow SMEs to compete with their larger counterparts on an equal basis.
Most governments do not have the finances or the ability to get involved 
directly in SME financing and service provision. Government appears not to be 
the appropriate vehicle to implement and coordinate such efforts, and public–
private partnerships for SME development seem a more critical element for 
the success of these efforts.
Improving Media Coverage of SMEs
How many times do reporters rush to a press conference thrown by a major 
industry and barely cast a glance at a press release from a little guy? That is 
too often the case, not only in emerging economies but in many other parts 
of the world. Yet they are ignoring a real economic story, which is lying under 
their very noses.
There are two major actions that business journalists can take to improve 
media coverage of SMEs. One is to do some research and match the statistics 
for SMEs in their own countries against those of the EU or US. Is it a similar 
situation, and what reporting can be done on it in both a regional and inter-
national context? If the EU analysts are correct, then inward investment is 
directly connected to the success of small business in emerging markets. But 
does the outside world know about it?
Note

■
  Some will argue that journalists report bad news. By its very definition, news is anomalous 
and mostly disturbing. But business reporting can draw attention to the positive. Using the reporting 
and news skills outlined elsewhere in this book, attractive reporting is possible on the rise of SMEs.

Chapter 20 | SMEs and the Economy 
178
The other major concern for business journalists is to check if their govern-
ment is living up to its stated support of the SME sector. The governments of 
numerous economies in transition have gone on record as saying they have 
helped increase economic growth through activities supporting the SME sec-
tor. “SMEs are at the top of the EU priority list. They are the engine of eco-
nomic growth and job creation,” says Richard Brunton, EU Minister for Jobs, 
Enterprise & Innovation.
A range of government statistics shows the number of SMEs globally is increas-
ing year by year, providing new jobs.  Many governments claim they have cre-
ated a favorable SME environment through programs and policies such as the 
following:
legal reform
• 
financial and investment support
• 
provision of credit guarantees
• 
assistance in creation and development of support 
• 
infrastructures
business information and consultancy support
• 
promotion of foreign economic activities
• 
support of innovation activities and introduction of mod-
• 
ern technologies
introduction of favorable tax policies
• 
vocational education and training
• 
creation of simplified systems for statistic reports and 
• 
accountancy
support of state purchases
• 
establishment of national centers for SMEs

Admittedly these programs and policies have had to weather a horrendous 
financial crisis for almost every economy in the world. But as the guardians 
and watchdogs of civil society, it is up to journalists to keep examining the 
execution of these policies in terms of the following parameters: 
Is the framework still there?
• 
How successful have these aims been?
• 
What changes were forced to be made?
• 
Have government policies given a boost to the SME 
• 
sector?

If governments’ claims are true (and the overall SME statistics seem to bear 
them out), then there are some good global news stories to be had. If not, 
then there is a story in explaining to readers and viewers why the corner shop 
next door to them in any major economy was forced to close last week.
One of the back-breaking but essential tasks of a business journalist is to 
examine carefully a government’s record of fulfillment against its claims and 
policies. What the government says it is going to do is often clearly laid out 
but not always implemented. Governments in any country are not noted for 
admitting to mistakes unless they have to. Generally it is opposition parties 
in democratic countries who challenge government policy, but the role of 
journalists is equally important in comparing policy statements against reality.
Examples of SME Policies
Contained in the following sections are official statements of national SME 
policies by the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom. As 
you read these sections, be alert to the pertinent journalistic questions: Do 
the government’s stated aims match up to the reality? If not, why not? So why 
not investigate?
United States
The website of the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) states1:
Small businesses are the backbone of the U.S. economy and the 
primary source of jobs for Americans. Small- and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs) also account for the largest group of U.S. 
exporters and are a major user of imported goods. In October 
2009, USTR launched a new trade policy initiative to enable SMEs 
to grow their businesses and generate jobs through international 
trade. An agency-wide working group is ensuring that policymaking 
and enforcement better serve small- and medium-sized enterprises. 
USTR has also requested an investigation by the International Trade 
Commission on the role of small- and medium-sized exporters, to 
inform trade policy efforts.
This is what the policy is. Such policy statements are easily found on govern-
ment websites in the early stages of a reporter’s research.

Chapter 20 | SMEs and the Economy

In April 2011, eighteen months after the launch of its SME policy initiative, 
the Office of the USTR, the Commerce Department’s International Trade 
Administration, and the Small Business Administration unveiled the online 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Tariff Tool, officially described as follows2:
Small exporters now have an online resource that streamlines tariff 
information for 85 percent of goods going to 20 foreign markets 
with which the U.S. has negotiated trade agreements. This tool 
makes it easier for small businesses to grow and prosper through 
exports….
The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) is conducting a 
series of three USTR-requested investigations to better understand 
how many of America’s small- and medium-sized enterprises export 
goods and services now, their role in generating employment and 
economic activity in the U.S., their performance in trade compared 
to SMEs in other advanced economies, and the particular barriers in 
foreign markets to the expansion of their trade activity that USTR 
can address through trade policy. Based on information obtained in 
these reports and on on-going engagement with small businesses, 
USTR will seek to set priorities for new trade agreements and for 
the implementation of existing trade agreements that are more 
responsive to the needs of these businesses and their workers, so 
that export promotion programs at other agencies have a better 
chance to succeed.
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is already assisting U.S. 
small businesses by removing barriers in the international trading 
system.
High tariffs serve as added taxes on U.S. exports and imports, 
driving up the cost of small businesses’ products and narrowing 
their potential markets.
The United States is seeking across-the-board tariff reductions and 
the elimination of tariffs on all industrial and consumer goods through 
bilateral trade agreements that will benefit all U.S. businesses, large 
and small.
Any investigation into these claims should make a note of this statement, 
which suggests that the US government is backing SMEs in a very substantial 
way. In particular, it says it has eased the burden of import and export tariffs 
for SMEs. Further, it points to an online resource so that SMEs can check what 
import taxes have been “streamlined” and that this tool will help SMEs to 
grow and prosper.

THE START OF A STORY
So does the website help? Ask small business associations if it has helped; look at the 
latest trade figures to see if there are obvious improvements in exports and imports and 
enquire just what tariffs were reduced and by how much. This at least is the start of a 
story—so see where it takes you.
The USTR website continues3:
The United States is actively engaged in developing trade agreements 
that support the growth of e-commerce and the enforceability of 
electronic transactions….
USTR is partnering with the Small Business Administration (SBA), 
the Commerce Department, the Export-Import Bank, and others 
across the federal government to provide American businesses the 
resources and the opportunities they need to succeed.
Working with Congress and other agencies across the government, 
our objective is to both increase the number of small- and medium-
sized businesses that export and to expand the number of markets 
and customers served by the SMEs that do export.
From a business journalist’s perspective, why not put in a call to the Small 
Business Administration to see how the partnership with the USTR is devel-
oping. How and why is it helping SMEs?
The USTR website goes on4:
In order to better understand the key challenges that are 
constraining U.S. SMEs from fulfilling their export potential, we 
continue to reach out widely to trade associations and individual 
companies, from the National Association of Manufacturers, to the 
National Small Business Association, and to individual SMEs. And we 
are consulting with economists inside and outside the government, 
and with our interagency partners, to identify and remove barriers 
limiting SME exports.

As a business journalist, you might want to investigate. What does the 
National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the National Small 
Business Association (NSBA) think of these initiatives? Get statements from 
their executives to see if they are happy with what government is doing and 
ask USTR for some examples, even names of individual companies which the 
Trade department has “reached out” to.
Finally, the USTR says it is consulting with economists on removing trade 
barriers. Economists can be the most independent-minded of experts. Track 
down some of these economists, especially the external ones and see what 
they have to say.
These claims by government can give rise to a wealth of stories. Without pre-
judging what your research might reveal, the chances are that the independent 
assessments you report will be a lively mix of positive and negative.

The UK government says that it is doing the following to “make the UK an

We’re funding and managing initiatives to encourage young people

young people about running their own business
working with schools and colleges to promote schemes

set up businesses
The government has also launched websites that provide information to SMEs 
on how to run and grow their business.
According to the UK Department for Business, Innovation & Skills and the 
HM Treasury6:
The number of private sector businesses in the UK increased to 4.8 
million at the start of 2012—a record high. Barclays estimate there 
were just under 500,000 business start-ups in England and Wales in 
2011; also a record number and 12,700 (2.6%) more than in 2010.
In the same period about 500,000 businesses closed. Businesses 
have said that they need access to finance and less red tape in order 
to keep running.
We’ve developed our policies to support start-ups and SMEs so that 
they can continue to grow and make a contribution to the economy 
and so that they get access to finance and support that hasn’t been 
previously available….

Skeptical journalists have already challenged some of these claims by the UK 
government, and stories about banking support through Bank of England lend-
ing have been widely criticized.
Were the criticisms justified? Challenge some of these claims by both bankers 
and governments, talk to sector analysts and economists. Is the UK govern-
ment living up to the SME support is has publicly stated and has the SME sec-
tor benefited from government activities?
Attitudes toward Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship
The level of small business development in each country depends signifi-
cantly on that country’s attitude toward small business and entrepreneur-
ship in general.
The small business sector develops in each economy under the influence of 
numerous factors: the macroeconomic situation and the particular demands 
of the population, the regulatory environment, and so forth. But the capacity 
of small business to overcome any negative impact of some or all of these  
factors depends on how governments view the SME sector.
The US, UK, and EU have transparent policies in place to provide support to 
what they say is an important part of their economic activity. So do SMEs benefit 
from these seemingly positive policies? The success (or otherwise) of the small 
business sector depends on each nation’s attitude toward entrepreneurial initia-
tives and the economic environment that encourages entrepreneurial drive.
The journalist’s job, of course, is to report on the sector as impartially as pos-
sible. Big business often offers epicurean lunches, mahogany-paneled boardroom 
chats, or chances to test-drive luxury cars. It’s human nature that reporters 
should prefer to examine business while enjoying such creature comforts.
The executives at an SME or a sole trader usually get to the point of the story 
they want to tell more directly. A sandwich and a bottle of beer is more the 
order of the day.
It is therefore not unusual that individual companies are ignored and the small 
business sector perhaps not properly reflected in news bulletins in proportion 
to its importance. But remember that today’s tiny backroom business might 
be tomorrow’s rival to Microsoft.

Even if it isn’t, there is a big well of colorful stories ready for the telling—not 
only entertaining in their own right but more illustrative of the importance of 
this sector than a mere recital of dry government statistics.
Key Points
Journalists need to understand the role and importance 
• 
of SMEs.
To assess the performance of European national SMEs, 
• 
compare the statistics for SME performance in the sub-
ject country to overall EU data. Analogously in the United 
States, measure your state against statistics for the US.
It’s important to investigate if domestic governments 
• 
have lived up to their promulgated policies on SMEs by 
checking how SMEs perform.
Examine your country’s stated approach in support of 
• 
SMEs; then ask questions of external entities such as small 
business associations, analysts, and opposition parties.
Look for SME stories—they are colorful and occasion-
• 
ally by serendipity prove to be dramatic prologues to the 
emergence of major businesses.

The Importance 
of a Census
The economic data that are available to the public in any country can be 
especially important to business reporters. None are more so than a census. 
As an example of how this sort of data can and should be used, the census  
figures in Armenia typify the problems experienced by reporters on smaller 
and transitional economies. The population numbers of Armenia are a hot 
topic of debate. Official figures show the country has more than 3 million 
residents; critics say it is half that.
Why does it matter? Why should economic and business journalists pay  
attention to the numbers, whatever they are?
The Need for a Census
The fact is that every country needs basic information on its residents for  
purposes of planning, development, and improvement of quality of life. Statistical 
information, which serves as the basis for the planning of forecasts, is essential 
for the democratic process. In the Armenian case, the population figures are  
a standard by which foreign aid is allocated to the country.
The census is basically a head count of the general population to determine 
such questions as housing conditions, age, gender, immigration, emigration, 
marital status, number of children, employment, and so on. The data form 
a basis of information for purposes of decision making in a variety of areas 
in the life of residents of the country. All these data come from the official  
census, usually held once every ten years in most open-market economies but, 
controversially, less frequently in Armenia.

Chapter 21 | The Importance of a Census
188
CENSUS DATA IN THE US AND THE UK
In the United States, the national census is taken by the US Census Bureau. The last 
time a full population census was run was in 2010, but the Bureau takes surveys for 
other government agencies such as employment, crime statistics, housing needs, and 
so forth much more frequently.
The last British census under the old system took place in 2011, and it is the country’s 
Office for National Statistics (ONS) that undertakes the census. Like its American 
counterpart, it is responsible for providing a whole range of other economic and 
demographic data at regular intervals.
Collection of census data in both countries goes back for more than 200 years. But in 
looking at historic records, American journalists need to be a little cautious because a 
census was also taken at the state level by a number of states for a good many years.
The census serves as a guide for inward investment. A simple example is 
international consumer chains. Hamburger manufacturers won’t invest in 
a national franchise if they believe that there are not indeed three million  
hungry mouths waiting to consume their beef in a bun, but only half that  
number; likewise with soft drink distributors or international brewers.
Domestically, population figures are used to plan roads. Where do they go to 
and what volume of traffic are they likely to experience? How many school 
children are there now and likely to be in the future? Such data is required 
to plan the school building program, the training of teachers, and the areas of 
most educational need.
Governments need census figures especially for budgeting purposes. There is 
no sense in planning for schools for a million children if the country only has 
a quarter of that number, or provisioning for 250,000 pensioners when the 
true figure is a million.
Census Information and the National Budget
Unfortunately, the national budget is an item that is highly vulnerable to both 
corruption and incompetence. Therefore, the economic and business reporter 
needs to be able to read a government budget and understand adequately 
what money is being spent where and why.
To accurately determine whether expenditure is being allocated in the proper 
areas and to monitor that activity, reporters need to know statistics from the 
census. How many people are there in the country and how is the money 
being spent on them?

Business Journalism
189
Census information also helps answer questions on government revenues. 
How much tax money can be expected? And if the figures are inaccurate, what 
are the consequences, not only for the government but for the individual?
In short, understanding population data and looking for frequent updates, 
especially through a full census, is an important part of a journalist’s job in 
monitoring government activities.
What Census Information Tells Us
Census information is used by all sections of the community, from national 
and regional government to town planners, community groups, large and small 
businesses, and more. The figures can determine electoral boundaries and 
the distribution of government funds to the regions. They can help plan basic 
services such as housing, social security, transport, education, industry, shops, 
and hospitals. The information also lets government see how the cities are 
growing (or shrinking) and what services will be needed in the future.
In the modern world a key requirement of a census is to disclose the distribu-
tion of minority and ethnic groups in a country and the financial implications for 
the budget process. Similarly, immigration and emigration are important issues.  
If a country is experiencing a huge influx of people from other countries, it needs 
to know if the immigrants will bring benefits (greater tax revenues) or prob-
lems (lack of housing). Emigration in large numbers means that tax revenues will 
decrease and services will become more expensive to provide.
There is also the question of transfers from overseas relatives. Many European 
families receive monies from relatives living outside the country, and this 
income can be important to a nation’s economy. But often, as populations age, 
these transfers dwindle; and unless the data can alert governments to changes 
of this nature, its expenditure will be far greater than its income.
The Role of Reporters and Census 
Information
Economic reporters and, for that matter, those who report on government, 
shouldn’t wait for a census to take place to ask questions and monitor activity. 
It is always necessary to ask about the questions used on the census forms. 
While population numbers are the biggest statistic required, individual pieces 
of the information requested can be controversial and in some countries 
are deemed to attack the privacy of the individual and enlarge the power of  
the state. It should be the role of media in any country not only to examine 
government spending based on census figures but also to demand the fullest 
public debate on what specific data the census collects.

Chapter 21 | The Importance of a Census
190
Governments are often joined by industry and commerce in requiring accurate 
data. Both domestic and overseas investors need to know the best locations 
for manufacturing plants, warehouses, stores, and other facilities. They need 
information to assess potential markets and forecast sales, allocate advertis-
ing budgets, and staff numbers. This is all important material for business and  
economic journalists in pursuit of a story.
Census data is essential for some of the most important decisions made by 
government planners, social services, and business firms. So the media have 
a pivotal role in ensuring that a full and untainted census is held on a regu-
lar basis and that they use that data to monitor government and business  
performance in both the economic and social sphere.
What’s more, the media should examine whether censuses gather appropriate 
information for the authorities to ensure that their planning reflects the actions 
and activities that will keep the country on a path to recovery, prosperity, and a 
successful transition from the old centrally planned economy of the past.
No More Census?
Even as I write this chapter, I yield to the force of my caveat to young 
journalists: “The golden rule of journalism is that there is no golden rule.” 
In September 2013, the ONS proposed to do away with the comprehensive 
UK national census conducted every ten years since 1801, to be replaced 
by a fluid sampling questionnaire.
But as with many government proposals, in a democratic country, opposition 
parties and many organizations that rely on the census have accused the 
government of ending the survey, which in Britain takes place every ten years, 
to try and hide the truth about the number of immigrants entering the coun-
try. Immigration has been hotly debated in the UK, with suggestions that the 
figures are much higher than reported and the government is lax about trying 
to control it. The government says it wants to find a less expensive method of 
counting the population, while critics say it could permit politicians to “bury 
the truth about immigration numbers.”
UK officials also want to tap into the huge databases belonging to the private 
sector and merge the data with publicly held information. They want to use 
Google data, supermarket files, and energy companies. If such changes are 
made, many governments throughout the world will be watching closely how 
successful these changes are. The cost will undoubtedly be cut, an inviting 
prospect for a number of countries.

Business Journalism
191
STABILITY OF THE US CENSUS
It is unlikely this sort of debate will take place in the United States, because the power 
and obligation to implement a census are enshrined in the American Constitution. Apart 
from the administrative and economic justifications for censuses laid out in this chapter, 
the US Census is the official basis for equitable apportionment of seats and redrawing 
of electoral districts on the principle of proportional representation.
Using Census Data in Stories
While many stories rely on the most recent census information, data from past 
records are often used to illustrate a comparison where the facts demand it.
A major issue in the European Union is the free movement of people, which is 
one of the key principles of the Union. Some member states, notably Britain, 
are concerned that the level of immigration from new member states is reach-
ing an unsustainable level.
Therefore, reporters use past census population figures to show how many 
newcomers to the country are from a particular state. Their reports often 
carry comparisons year on year and decade on decade to show a sharp 
increase or decrease in the immigration data to support their argument.
Media also use figures—for instance, on numbers of schools and pupils—in 
demonstrating that education facilities are bulging at the seams or medical 
patient statistics to indicate whether sufficient doctors are available or being 
trained.
Without a census, reporting of this nature would prove very difficult.
The US Census Bureau is now making life easier for reporters than in the 
past, by putting out a series of press information packs including information 
on such topics as population movements, the aging of people over a period 
of time, home ownership numbers, urban versus countryside dwellers, and 
the growth and patterns of multiracial communities. Previously, reporters had 
to do much more analytic research themselves. All this information provides 
enterprising journalists and specialist journalists (education, crime, environ-
ment) a wealth of material for national and domestic stories.
Civic organizations concerned with the poor, for example, triggered a flurry 
of stories in the United States by using 2010 census data to suggest that half 
the American population was below the poverty line. Reporters who followed 
up on the claim spawned a series of stories that either showed the data was 
being manipulated or that the food stamp program helped or didn’t help and 
that urban populations were shifting or remaining static. But all these topics 
required journalists to access data from the 2010 census to back up the facts 
about the stories that they were writing.

Key Points
The census is important not only to aid the democratic 
• 
process but also to aid inward investment.
Government and business planning is dependent on an 
• 
accurate census.
Reporters should ask questions about the content 
• 
of a census to ensure it is asking for the right sort of 
information.
Census data can point journalists in the direction of many 
• 
stories in such areas as immigration, education, and old 
people’s facilities.

The Good, the 
Bad, and the Ugly
Journalism is not an exact science, it bears repeating. There are no rules 
and regulations for journalists as in, for example, the legal or accounting 
professions. But there are codes of conduct, which honest journalists 
should try to follow.
Unfortunately, journalism is such a hotchpotch international community 
involving untold thousands of   “scribes” that it isn’t uniformly ethical, accurate, 
or honest. Fortunately, most news writers and broadcasters it has been my 
pleasure and privilege to work with fall into the honest and ethical category. 
But I have also come into contact with others who have had few principles or 
scruples, have given way to bias or personal feelings, or have been reprehen-
sibly careless of the consequences of what they report.
Think carefully before you publish a story, and decide whether you will be 
filled with professional pride for a job well done or will toss and turn in your 
sleep, knowing that your story caused irreparable harm either to a group 
of people or even just a single individual. Business journalism has a greater 
chance of ruining lives, businesses, or even governments through bad report-
ing than almost any other form of journalism.
Following are a few samples of good reporting, bad reporting, and the careless 
(ugly) reporting that has occurred over the past few years.

Covering the 2008 Financial Crisis
This first example involves the reporting surrounding the economic crisis of 
2008. When the economic crisis hit the world that autumn, the airwaves and 
newspaper pages were filled with stories on the economy. Some were good; 
some were bad. In the following sections, I’ll describe how two different media 
outlets reported on the same story, to the benefit or detriment of readers.
HEADLINES ON THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
“Worst Crisis Since the 90s with No End Yet in Sight” (The Wall Street Journal)
“Financial Crisis Brings Economy to Its Knees” (Washington Business Journal)
“Markets in Disarray as Lending Locks Up” (The Washington Post)
“Three Weeks That Changed the World” (The Guardian)
“Citigroup to Axe 50000” (London Evening Standard)
“Bank Collapse Sends Shock Waves Around the World” (The Times)
“The Worst Market Crisis in 60 years” (Financial Times)
A Bleak Future
An example of very poor reporting of the crisis occurred on one English-
language television station that was broadcasting news around the world. This 
TV news station began its news bulletin on the state of the economy by saying 
that bankers were facing a bleak future. This was one of three headlines; the 
other two stories were not related to the economy at all.
The station led off the main part of its bulletin with the economic crisis, which 
was OK. But then it dealt with this major crisis, which was affecting a large part 
of its population, by reporting from a bar, where it said bankers and brokers 
were drowning their sorrows because they were about to lose their jobs. The 
entire story showed bartenders serving large quantities of cocktails named 
after various merchant banks that were facing bankruptcy while a number of 
young men, swilling drinks, bemoaned their fate. No commentary, no informed 
opinions, no detail of the crisis—just a bunch of people getting drunk.
In this story there was no mention of how the crisis would affect the general 
population, such as in job losses; or the how the crisis would have such dev-
astating effects on the global economy, such as in bank collapses, inflation, and 
high interest rates. Instead the story was a light-hearted piece that mourned 
the bankers’ loss of wages and the fact that alcohol would make it less painful. 

Business Journalism
195
There was no expert interviewed; in fact, all the sound bites were from the 
drinkers, who may or may not have been bankers. The piece told the viewer 
nothing about the crisis in general.
When the station cut back to the studio, the presenter introduced a business 
analyst to give an explanation of the crisis. That would have been fine, except 
in this case the analyst, who might reasonably have been presumed by view-
ers to have been an independent analyst, was the television station’s business 
news editor.
Caution
■
■
  There is nothing wrong in using expert reporters as long as they are correctly identified. 
In fact, BBC does this to excess. But suggesting that a news editor is a business analyst is deceitful. 
The reason analysts are used as commentators is to give an independent view of an issue and 
establish credibility. Using a journalist in this way achieved the opposite.
Overall, the reporting was sloppy, lacked credibility, and demonstrated that 
the news operation either didn’t understand the effect the crisis was hav-
ing on its country or was completely oblivious to and unsympathetic of the 
effects on the general populace.
It was extremely poor journalism.
Real Reporting
Another station, which was based in the UK, gave a report on the same day 
and at roughly the same time with a real feel for the importance of the story. 
Again there were three headlines. In turn, the headlines showed how markets 
were tumbling, how jobs across the country were under threat, and what the 
government proposed to do about it.
The anchor presented the program from the floor of a major brokerage, thus 
establishing what the story was about; and an independent analyst appeared 
on screen who explained what was happening to stock markets and why the 
collapse of stock prices was important.
Next, a report was made live from the center of London to explain the possi-
bility of job losses, the effect on pensions, loss of savings, salary cuts, and other 
issues affecting the ordinary person.
Finally, the program went live to 10 Downing Street, the home of the British 
Prime Minister, for a press conference with the Prime Minister himself, who 
was questioned closely by informed journalists.

Chapter 22 | The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
196
All this was illustrated with excellent graphics, news pictures, and interviews 
with experts. It was a job very well done. The story established huge cred-
ibility for the broadcaster and engendered trust for its news bulletins over the 
next weeks and months as the crisis spiralled out of control.
The comparison of how the same story was handled in two different ways is 
not nationalist jingoism. It is a simple matter of competence and understanding. 
The one broadcaster cared about the effect on its audience; the other simply 
bemoaned the fate of a small portion of its citizenry.
An Example of Careless Reporting
The level of national retail sales is an important indicator of how well an 
economy is doing. So, as the financial crisis started in 2008, many news reports 
looked at the statistics being published. However, some journalists seemed 
to be determined to find an alarming headline no matter what the statistics 
really said.
One news web site had the headline “UK Retail Sales at Record Low,”  
followed by “A Report on UK Retail Sales Has Posted Its Worst Monthly 
Reading for 25 years.”
The report (from an organization representing businesses) actually said that 
46% of retailers questioned had reported a fall in sales. So the majority (54%) 
must have reported rising or static sales. However, none of this tells readers 
what the level of sales actually was. Retail sales could not possibly be lower 
than 25 years ago as the headline said. The economy nearly doubled in size 
over that time period. Indeed, right at the end of the article was a sentence 
saying official government retail sales statistics showed a rise.
This report was careless and irresponsible journalism.
An Example of Good Reporting
This same web site as described in the previous section also published a good 
report on investment in the telecommunications industry in the UK. BT, the 
privatized former state monopoly telephone company, announced plans to 
make a huge investment (£1.5 billion) in fiber optic cables. No doubt much of 
the information in the article came from a press release from BT.
But the journalist made the extra effort to describe what this rather techni-
cal announcement meant to ordinary households throughout the country. 
Citizens would get much faster broadband, depending on where they lived, 
and would be able to run several computer applications at once, such as 
downloading high-definition movies, gaming, and working on complex graphics 
projects. The journalist also made sure to write about the commercial rivals

to BT, describing what they were doing to improve their services. The article 
also described the impact of government policies, such as the level of profits 
the national telecommunications regulator allows and whether this is suf-
ficient return on capital for such large investments. The journalist also made 
the effort to call BT and ask follow-up questions.
This journalist turned a dry and technical announcement into an interesting 
look at how technology is changing our lives and how big commercial firms 
are fighting it out in the marketplace.
Reporting in Emerging Economies
In some emerging economies, competent business reporting is still like a dis-
tant star in the sky. Journalists have become intoxicated with the notion of 
freedom of the press. But the idea that freedom comes with responsibility has 
yet to sink in.
In one country, a mobile telephone company was making healthy profits. But 
journalists had been taught under the previously authoritarian regime that 
profit equaled corruption. Without much effort at getting the facts, en masse 
the media began trumpeting this idea and made it a headline story that execu-
tives at the phone company were corrupt. When challenged, reporter after 
reporter used the old excuse, which validates nothing: “But everyone knows 
this to be true.”
This disgraceful attempt at writing a story eventually caused the resignation 
of the mobile telephone company's chief executive and a less competent 
replacement taking over. A subsequent investigation by an international team 
of investigators made up of French, American, and British financial experts 
showed no evidence of corrupt practices, but it was too late. The CEO had 
resigned and the damage was done. A big international telecoms company had 
shown interest in taking a stake, which would have provided the company with 
much needed investment, but it pulled out because of the negative publicity. 
Jobs were lost, expansion drew to a standstill, and the country’s ability to 
trade internationally was severely curbed. The overall effect was to set back 
the country’s economic revival by a considerable length of time. (And yet for a 
considerable time afterward, some journalists continued to boast about their 
part in the downfall of the CEO, as if they had been successful in one of the 
great investigative stories of all time.)
Bad, even ignorant reporting such as this can impact on an economy, causing 
misery and grief because ill-trained and badly prepared media simply want 
a story.

Perhaps there is some excuse for such shoddy journalism in developing 
nations, but there was none for another scandal, still rumbling on in the UK, 
discussed next.
MEDIA AND THE GOVERNMENT
In fairness, some governments spend a great deal of money on trying to develop a 
fair and free press in emerging economies. But my experience is that their efforts are 
neutered by putting media programs into the hands of civil servants who know nothing 
about the media, local officials who can’t shrug off the notion that the press should be 
servile to authority, or people who think “ethics” is a dirty word and use funding to line 
their own pockets.
Britain’s Phone-Hacking Scandal
The phone-hacking scandal in the UK, which rocked the headlines in 2011, 
also had some ramifications in the United States, but the main impact was in 
the UK. I’ll give a brief outline of what happened.
To get the story, reporters at some British newspapers used modern technol-
ogy to hack into the mobile phones of celebrities, bankers, politicians, and other 
noteworthy souls. A police investigation, slow in responding to original charges 
of hacking, discovered that the practice had become widespread. Eventually, UK 
Prime Minister David Cameron ordered an inquiry headed by a senior judge, 
Lord Justice Leveson, which revealed that reporters had routinely hacked into 
the phones of the British Royal Family, the families of murder victims, and rela-
tives of those killed in the London bombings of July 2005.
The public outcry at this unethical practice led to a very old British news-
paper, The News of the World, being shut down after publishing for 168 years. 
Several executives of the owner’s publishing empire resigned and, for the first 
time in its history, the British press was threatened with government regula-
tion. The parent company of the News of the World, News International (NI; 
with its headquarters in New York), owned a number of major media orga-
nizations, and resignations were handed in from leading editors at NI’s stable 
of companies including Dow Jones. Dow Jones’ parent company, News Corp., 
was investigated by the FBI and the Department of Justice.
Perhaps the worst aspect of this breakdown in journalistic ethics was an 
apparent lack of remorse from senior executives of these publications, which 
might still have the knock-on effect of causing limitations to be imposed on 
freedom of the press in Britain and beyond.

A Bright Future
While the “Leveson Affair” uncovered some bad and ugly practices in media 
worldwide, the reporting of the huge financial crisis of the “noughties” was 
largely exemplary and something of which all media, but especially business 
media, should be proud.
The world was informed about this major economic tragedy through bold 
reporting, knowledgeable commentary, and easy-to-read articles that were 
graphic but technically proficient. And so the world began to understand 
through the media just what had happened and what the consequences were.
It was a feather in the cap of good journalism, wherever it is practiced.
Key Points
Poor economic reporting can obscure the truth of a 
• 
situation.
Competent and full reporting can explain a complex  
• 
situation to a broad audience.
Corrupt reporting can cause irreparable harm to  
• 
communities and individuals.
Unethical practices in journalism can damage the entire 
• 
media industry.

The Pros Speak: 
Journalists from 
the East and the 
West
People either love or loath journalists. There is no in-between. Throughout my 
career I have had to enter hot debate at dinner parties in which one or other 
of the guests have argued, “It’s all the fault of the media!”—citing the rise in 
the price of food to the fall of a government as the issue the media fueled.
To the dinner fray, I bring my personal experience. I have worked in numerous 
countries with authoritarian rulers in charge and have been able to cite many 
examples of how a press that is not free can’t stop excesses by governments 
determined not to be transparent.
In Romania, for example, I witnessed a piece of video on TV showing a cabinet 
minister taking a brown paper envelope stuffed with cash from a businessman. 
The government’s response to this was to ban the showing of such videos on 
television. Yes, there must be responsibility among the press, but a press that 
is muted because people don’t like what they say is a sad press indeed.

On another occasion in Serbia, I hosted a seminar for business journalists and 
waxed lyrical about a free press and an ethical press. One young journalist 
threw into the debate his experience with his boss. He was told to cover the 
opening of a factory. His editor said he was to pick up a press release, not 
ask questions, and return it to the newspaper, which published it just as it was 
written by the factory owner.
I expressed my dismay, but his punch line was: “The owner also gave me an 
envelope with cash in it.” I was even more appalled until he said, “The trouble 
is, the money was my wages.”
What would you have done? Happily, much of this sort of conduct is being 
eradicated in emerging economies. However, there are still regular reports 
from independent monitors such as the UN and the International Federation 
of Journalists that governments in emerging economies are backsliding on 
press freedom and transparency. They had guaranteed these freedoms when 
they wanted to join organizations such as the European Union, but now they 
have been given membership, they are beginning to forget those guarantees. 
So reporters, especially business journalists, must watch out for undue influence 
from government on how they can report or be censored.
The Joys of Being a Journalist
One of the wonders of being a journalist is the wide range of people you 
meet. These are often generals, prime ministers, film stars, sports celebrities, 
and company presidents. But perhaps the greatest joys are the firm friendships 
you strike up with fellow journalists, especially those you shared experiences 
with while working in hostile or unfamiliar environments.
Nothing is more pleasing to a “hack” than to stand around a bar and relive old 
times and tell tall tales. After all, that is what a journalist is—a teller of tales, 
and sometimes of tall tales.
But this is not often just idle chatter. Dedicated journalists are always discuss-
ing the state of the industry, changes in it (good and bad), ideas to make it 
even more effective, and certainly ways to ward off the threats to freedom 
experienced by many societies in which transparent reporting doesn’t sit well 
with the establishment.
Over the years I have developed an extensive network. And some of the debates 
that I have become involved with are far ranging and, from an industry point of 
view, fascinating. What follows is a sample of some thoughts that have come 
out of these discussions from journalists of long standing—journalists who have 
lived by the standards of impartiality and transparency that is in the code of  
ethics but who have very definite opinions on what the state of journalism is 
today. And it is remarkable how many of the following opinions expressed by 
my fellow journalists mirror thoughts I express in the preceding chapters.

Alex Kirby on the Importance of Journalism
Alex Kirby: former BBC editor who headed a news bureau in North Africa 
before returning to London as BBC Radio’s environment correspondent. Kirby 
now heads up an environmental news agency called Climate News Network.
Journalism certainly matters, if only because governments and the 
rest of those who seek to run our lives don’t like it. They don’t like 
journalism’s ability to shine a light on what they try to do in the dark. 
They don’t like our refusal automatically to believe everything they 
say. Remember the advice from the late Hannen Swaffer, a British 
writer: “The only question a journalist needs to ask himself when 
interviewing a politician is this: ‘Why is this lying bastard telling me 
this particular lie at this particular moment?”’
Journalists do their job when they hold the powerful to account. 
They betray their readers/listeners/viewers when they let themselves 
become useful microphones for politicians, PR companies, campaigners 
or armies—or for the entertainment industry.
By all means write about footballers or pop singers or whoever you 
like. Just don’t call it journalism. Much journalism in countries like the 
UK is now a branch of showbiz, and it uses some very dodgy tricks: 
hacking ’phones, monstering individuals, buying stories. Anyone who 
behaves like this should be driven out of the trade. But even with 
these appalling blemishes, journalism which holds the feet of the rich 
and powerful to the flames is so important that no democracy will 
survive without it.
Traditional journalism is changing fast, not because of the behaviour 
of journalists but because of technology and economics. Why print 
a newspaper when people can read it online? Why, if you can read it 
online, should you pay for it? But unless you do pay for it somehow, 
not many proprietors will spend money producing a free service. So 
niche websites produced by citizen journalists are increasingly filling 
the yawning chasms which have opened up in the last decade.
I’m fine with that—so long as citizen journalists remember that you 
can always find someone on the Web who will give you a convenient 
quote, and that working online requires more skepticism, not less. 
Oh—and that the job is supremely important, but the journalist isn’t 
important at all…like the colleague who arrived at the scene of an 
incident and announced himself as a journalist. “Never mind,” said 
a sympathetic bystander. “We’ve all got to earn a living somehow.” 
Quite right too.

Ann Turner on Having an Open Mind
Ann Turner: former seasoned Reuter’s journalist who decided to hop off to 
Southeast Asia. She now practices as a PR Consultant in Timor Leste.
At 23 years of age, I had achieved a position in television news 
where I thought that I was “senior” to real senior people. We were 
covering a hijack at a European airport and I turned round to the 
cameraman, who had racked up 30 years in the business, and told 
him to be sure that he rolled when the door of the aircraft opened. 
He tore me off a strip in front of about 100 other journalists.  
I thought to myself, “I can either burst into tears here, or walk away 
crying privately.” I took the latter option.
I walked in the blazing sun along the airport perimeter fence for 
a kilometer or so, until I saw a small snack bar in the distance.  
I entered and ordered food and drink and asked them to put it all 
into a cardboard box. I set out back to the press pack. I laid it at his 
feet. Everyone said, “Awwwww”…but I never forgot the lesson he 
was trying to teach me. I was lucky to be slapped down so early in 
my “uppity” phase.
Nowadays, new journos don’t often have the opportunity to learn 
from the “grey heads”’ in the business. Their pensions are too 
expensive for them to be retained in positions where they can 
share their expertise with the less-experienced people so they end 
up taking “early retirement.” I have never forgotten cameraman 
Roberto Matteoli and the hard lesson he taught me about respect 
for experience. He’d done more than a couple of hijackings in his 
time (this was in the 1980s).
We worked together for a few years after that, and one day on a 
shoot he asked me, “What do you think I should do?” I felt like I 
had won the lottery. If you are lucky enough to have a crusty old 
relic in the corner of the newsroom (and few people are nowadays), 
take the legacy of their experience, respect them, and pass it on to 
others. Journalism is complicated. It takes more than one head to 
wrap around the complicated issues now—and then—and if you 
pool your resources you can create a story that is worth more 
than the sum of its parts. Old hands such as NBC’s Keith Miller, 
Richard Burr, and others can attest to this. TV news in the ’80s was 
far superior to what passes for TV journalism today. But of course, 
an old curmudgeon would say that, eh? ;-)

Bob Eggington on Surviving in the News 
Business
Bob Eggington: former long-serving senior news editor with the BBC. 
Eggington now works as a digital news consultant.
So you want a job in the news business? What! Are you crazy? It’s 
going down the tubes, isn’t it?
No, I don’t think it is. It is in trouble, of course. We’re all wearily 
familiar with its economic problems. What used to be a high-cost, 
high-profit margin business has become a high-cost, no-margin 
business. Yet it stumbles on. Why is this? Perhaps the airline industry 
gives us a clue. Its costs are horrendously large. Profits are hideously 
difficult to come by. Yet people keep starting new airlines and 
throwing themselves enthusiastically into making a success of this 
extremely challenging business. Why is this? Perhaps it’s because on 
a very basic level, people want to fly and need to fly. And many of 
them also want to make their careers in air travel.
Likewise, on a very basic level, people also want to know and need 
to know what’s going on in the world. And many of them also want 
to make their careers in journalism. I can’t imagine the air travel 
business coming to an end just because there is not enough money 
in it. And similarly, I can’t imagine the news media coming to an 
end just because the existing business model has collapsed. But it is 
certainly changing and the practice of journalism must change with 
it. How can you take advantage of this to improve your chances of 
getting a job?
There are many ways, but I will pick out the one that, for me, is 
most important: the need for journalism to be distinctive, if it is to 
survive. One effect of the information revolution is that news has 
become commoditized: now that people can look at hundreds of 
news sources in just a few minutes, they can see that coverage of 
the big news events is basically the same, everywhere. With all due 
respect (and I do mean that) to the BBC, CNN, The New York Times, 
Reuters, and all the rest—they’re telling us the same facts, in pretty 
much the same order. Read one version of a story and you don’t 
need to chase around reading the others: the differences will be 
marginal. General news has become a commodity, like pork bellies 
or coffee beans. That, I believe, is why so many providers of general 
news are struggling. There just isn’t the demand for a vast number 
of near identical suppliers.

Chapter 23 | The Pros Speak: Journalists from the East and the West
206
If a news organisation is to compete and prosper, it has to find 
something new to say. That means its journalists have to find 
something new to say. They have to bring new information, new angles, 
new insights. So, if you’re looking for a job and you want to impress 
a prospective employer, find a good story that nobody else has got. 
And if you want to keep your new job—and give your employer a 
chance to stay in business—keep on finding new stories.
The trouble with the beaten track is that it is beaten. Stay off it. Be 
a journalist who really does break news. That’s the only way to a 
secure future in and for the news business.
Robert “Bob” Elphick on Writing the First 
Draft of History
Robert “Bob” Elphick: Reuters and BBC Foreign Correspondent in Moscow 
and Algiers.
Journalism which has occupied me as well as my father and 
grandfather and kept us clothed and fed has changed considerably 
since I was first involved in the 1940s. It was once described as “the 
first draft of History”—which has always seemed a bit pompous to 
me. They say nostalgia ain’t what it used to be, but I wallow in a bit of 
it myself from time to time. I’ve been taking myself back more than 
half a century to the days when I started in journalism with all its 
faults, filth and noise and temptations.
It struck me that the craft of making newspapers or news bulletins, 
or just getting news from the source to the consumer, has altered 
to such an extent that a modern newsroom is unrecognizable to 
people like me, brought up in the days when typewriters and hot 
metal slugs of type were the cutting edge of technology.
It’s pretty creepy for us veterans when we walk into newsrooms 
nowadays and our shoes sink into deep pile carpets and there is  
a distinct hush broken only by the faint hum of a multitude of 
video screens and a whispered comment or so from the rather 
well-dressed people who populate them.
Nobody seems to shout or scream these days like they used to. 
Maybe in the old days they had to do this to be heard over the 
tremendous noise levels produced by a room full of sweaty people 
under stress banging away on typewriters with tele-printers every 
few yards chattering out their streams of tape.

Is newsgathering better done these days? There’s certainly a great 
deal more of it on offer with daily newspapers of more than a hundred 
pages on most days. Have historians placed too much reliance on 
what they find in newspapers of long ago (not to mention of those 
of today)? Is or was journalism ever the first draft of history?
All these thoughts were chasing their way through the mind during 
the last conference of the International Association for Media and 
History (IAMHIST) in Leicester when we were discussing among 
ourselves what the best novels with journalism at the centre are. 
They had to be novels because there are hundreds, even thousands, 
of journalistic memoirs. All these are interesting in their own way, 
but we wanted to get down to the essence of the question. Are there 
any good reads which expose the methods by which journalists get 
the stories and also how they get them back to where they can be 
printed or broadcast?
Three books come to my mind: Scoop by Evelyn Waugh, The Wire  
God by Jack Willard (joint pseudonym of Jack Guinn and Willard C. 
Haselbush), and The Kansas City Milkman by Reynolds Packard. These 
last two were by professional newsmen. Scoop, the best of these, 
was written by an already successful novelist who had tried his hand 
at journalism in his earlier days. Each of these books is set in the 
days just before and after World War 2.
I would say these were the heydays of print journalism of the old 
school, when new technology meant teleprinters and Hellschreibers 
and portable typewriters. It was a different world, well before the 
days of satellite phones and digital composition on fluorescent 
screens. You got to where the story was by ship or train and you 
filed by cable if you were lucky.
It was enough to find a cable head, or even by getting friendly 
travellers to “pigeon” your story or film by plane to London.
What do these books tell us about those times? They tell us it was 
more than a little venal; hard drinking was the norm; the search 
for a story, well-sourced or not, was the be-all and end-all of a 
journalist’s existence; but the unending worry about getting your 
copy from where you were to where it could be published was the 
main concern.
It worries me a bit as an old journalist when I hear people and 
especially academics speak of us as writing the first draft of history. 
Are scribblers in the Press really that important and are they in the 
business for influence or just to scratch a living?

Anna Di Lellio on Getting the Story
Anna Di Lellio: New York-based freelance journalist, correspondent for Italian 
paper L’Indipendente, and former Temporary Media Commissioner in Kosovo.
In the summer of 1994, the Football World Cup came to the United 
States. Toni Damascelli was the sports editor of my newspaper back 
in Milan, L’Indipendente, and he was desperate. It was not enough that 
the event he and his audience had been impatiently waiting for, for 
the past four years, was taking place in the only country in the world 
that could care less about it. He did not have funds for the team of 
reporters he needed to send to the US to cover the Cup—that is, 
fill out two pages daily for an entire month.
To make things worse, I was the only US correspondent the 
newspaper had. I covered culture and politics. As for football,  
I had not followed it since I was a child, when I sat down in front of 
our black and white TV to watch my father’s team, Internazionale, 
hopefully beat Liverpool. Toni flew to New York and begrudgingly 
promoted me sports correspondent on the spot. It wasn’t easy.
The Italian forward Roberto Baggio was a star for the Japanese 
media, but I had no idea who he was. Thankfully, his picture was on 
the cover of some American magazine and at least I knew what he 
looked like. It was when someone in the Italian press core heard me 
ask, “Who is Baresi?”—the very famous defender and captain of the 
team—that I became the object of incredulous curiosity.
“Who are you?” I was asked in turn by about forty male reporters 
who were such insiders they were updated even on the smallest 
joint pain of each player.
It did not help that I was one of only two women covering the 
Cup for the Italian media. The other, a veteran of many football 
international tournaments, had become one of the boys. I stood 
out as a woman who was hopelessly ignorant of football. A double 
whammy.
Despite my inadequacy, the coverage went on without major glitches. 
I wrote 2,000 words every day. I reported on soft news, such as the 
mood of the Italian players, or how their host town of Morristown, 
New Jersey, lived with their daily training, or how the world media 
treated the Italian team. As far as “hard news” went, Toni trusted 
me only with a straight coverage of press conferences. After the 
first couple of weeks, the other journalists grew accustomed to me 
hanging around, and so did the players. I began to blend in. And that 
was when my moment came.

Chapter 23 | The Pros Speak: Journalists from the East and the West

For some days, the gossip circulated around a perceived disagreement 
between the forward Daniele Massaro and the manager Arrigo 
Sacchi. Massaro, it seemed, was suffering from some injury. In 
between matches, there are two types of news that interest a football 
audience: infighting and the health of players I paid attention.
One early morning, when everyone else was drinking coffee and 
taking a smoke, I spotted Massaro sitting alone by the side of the 
training field. I approached him with a smile and asked him about 
how he felt. He began to talk about his injury and mentioned he 
had been misunderstood by the manager. I pretended I did not 
understand and asked for more.
Did Massaro know that even the most harmless-looking journalist 
is always a journalist? Did he care? I don’t know and I can’t even 
remember the substance of the story, but I wrote down everything 
he said. I made the front page and I was no longer looked at with 
amused condescension by my colleagues.
Danijela Kozina on Problem Reporting in  
the Balkans
Danijela Kozina: noted Bosnian journalist.
Concerning the fact that in the last two decades Bosnia and 
Herzegovina received hundreds of billions of euros for the 
democratisation of media, today’s state isn’t on the expected level. 
There is still big influence of political parties on the media, and media 
reporting is far from independent and objective.
It is especially visible in pre-election and election period. Media are 
still dependent of the subvention from different state levels. Because 
of the bad economic situation, I don’t expect that situation will 
improve in years to come—that kind of influence on objectivities of 
media and daily reporting.
Last election, president of Republika Srpska, smaller entity of BIH, 
gave subvention to a few of the biggest media houses in RS. After 
that last bastion of so called independent journalism fell.
Last situation with ID numbers for babies illustrates in which stage 
is journalism in our country now.
A few months ago, I was in front of Parliament building when 
protestors (angry citizens, students, parents of the newborn babies) 
blocked the Parliament because MPs couldn’t make a compromise 
on law which regulates issuing ID numbers for newborn babies. 

Business Journalism
211
Because of that, babies who were born during that period couldn’t 
get ID number and therefore couldn’t use healthcare.
I am definitely sure that people had been angry with all MPs not 
only the representatives from Republika Srpska. They are same for 
them because they don’t do for what they had been payed. But when 
I opened newspapers the following morning, I was surprised with 
so obvious twisting of the truth. There were no signs of objective 
perception of situation. Political parties from RS used this case, with 
the help of the media, for their daily political goals.
All their statements led to conclusion that they are the victim in that 
situation. Despite the fact that they shared the same destiny with other 
MPs and some foreign bankers who happened to participate that 
same day in a conference that was taking place in Parliament building.
I was shocked by that. And that made me wonder where our 
profession goes these days. Similar situation is in Federation of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
But despite this gloomy situation in media in Bosnia, there are few 
of them that are a kind of light on the end of tunnel. One of them 
is Center for Investigative Journalism. They illustrate what the real 
task of the journalist and media should be—presenting accurate 
information, searching for the facts and presenting it to the public in 
an accurate way, without any political influence.
Fair, independent journalism is essential for a democracy to function 
well. And by reporting what government, businesses and other 
institutions do, journalists are a kind of filter that gathers all the hidden 
and incomprehensible information and presents it to the citizens in a 
logical way so they could use it to decide everything from whom they 
should vote for to which university to attend to.
I hope, in a years to come, we will have much more media and 
journalists of this kind.

relative, isn’t it? At one point I thought my best story was filming

been living in a transit zone for two years. Later that year because 
of the coverage the story received globally, the family obtained

refugee status in Canada and arrived there safely. It just felt that it 
wasn’t just another daily news story that sees air and gets forgotten 
immediately after.
A few years back I got an opportunity to host a programme 
“Decade in Review” on Bloomberg TV—so that can be 
considered a high point in my career; however, it has hardly 
been as rewarding as some of the stories I covered while in 
the field.
Sadly, I always took this job too seriously and didn’t have THAT 
much fun. But I guess the most comical situation that still dominates 
dinner parties has to do with my coverage of a particular little war 
and having to discuss my script with an editor with a gun on his 
desk. Just like that: a news editor with a lack of sense of humour and 
a weapon on his desk telling me my script was unpatriotic and will 
never get back on air.
The most important part of being a journalist, I think, is to have an 
open mind. I think I was at my best as a journalist when I arrived at 
a story without any script or preconception of what was going on, 
very early in my career. So many of us these days become “experts” 
in what they cover, writing a story before it actually happens or 
deciding on the headline while on the way to the scene because 
of time constraints, demanding editors, or general cynicism. In my 
opinion it’s so important to be affected by a story.
I think the best of us are the crazies, the idealists, those who still 
maintain a degree of naiveté. It is the only way to then “sell” the 
story to your audience.
Alexander Sambuk on the Hazards of Starting 
a Business News Department
Alexander Sambuk: former Editor of Business News for Russia Today TV and 
part of the startup team.
Unfortunately, at the beginning of the new TV service, the RTV main 
newsroom had huge problems, such as lack of a professional approach 
to information which often led to an inability to convert raw video 
footage into professionally packaged broadcasting products.
Against this background, it was the Business Television unit which 
within a short time was able to set an example of how to successfully 
cope with very limited resources and produce a satisfying quality  
of broadcast output. It was there where young newcomers could 
learn what events are newsworthy and which of them are non-events,

or how this or that information can be in the end transformed into 
a news story, or what professional criteria are applied to a package 
story.
Among our innovative practices of editorial activities one can point 
out, for instance, the rule that the camera team should possibly all 
the time be used outside the premises, filming interviews or events 
on location, and to make sure only video material should be regularly 
(almost non-stop) delivered to our production site. This approach 
to the organization of the production process was to a great extent 
dictated by the traffic situation in Moscow where at the beginning 
most of our filming material was coming from. We had no chance 
to lose time for car transfers of different crews.
Instead of this, after completing for instance an interview, a reporter 
would go back to the office with his video whereas another 
person—producer or reporter—would at the same time head off 
from the office to a new location for another editorial task where 
the camera-team were already waiting for him. In this case, the time 
loss was driven to a minimum and at the same time it allowed us to 
get as much video material as possible in the typical traffic situation 
in the Russian capital.
So, during the day, thanks to this practice, we usually had a constant 
supply of the fresh video material and other information of exclusive 
character which allowed us to regularly update our business news 
items.
Behar Zogiani—Lest We Forget the Hazards 
of Journalism
Behar Zogiani: noted Kosovar journalist. Zogiani was sent to a village where 
atrocities by Serbian policemen were alleged to have occurred during the war 
of 1996–99.
For a second I thought I am going into the woods and hide. I walked 
fast on the asphalt road toward that part of it among big trees, 
being sure that if I reach there I might feel safer. Being afraid of the 
police I thought better if I run. But all of a sudden came to my mind 
that running means provoking police to react.
So, I started playing the role of “a brave man,” walking normally in 
the direction where the asphalt would be covered by trees! I was 
watching to see if the TV crew would come soon. Every minute was 
ages long to me. I would look at my watch even twice in a minute.  
I looked back and in front. I was sure no police saw me. I entered  

Chapter 23 | The Pros Speak: Journalists from the East and the West
214
in the bushes and hid in the way that no one can see me being there. 
I stayed there and tried to see if something moved on the road.
After a few minutes I established that when my crew comes they 
will not be able to see me either. So, I had no other choice than 
to get out. They were late by 10 minutes. I became nervous and 
angry at them for putting me in danger. All of a sudden I saw a big 
number of police coming from Peja to the village of Leshan. I had no 
alternative but to walk as “a brave man” and behave being innocent 
or doing my business.
The police found Zogiani and arrested him.
The police said, “Come with me inside the Police Station because 
we have prepared some special treatment for you.” While entering 
the building, I tried to explain to them how we are journalists and 
we should be left to do our job. About 20 policemen were standing 
with their backs to the walls, looking at us while we were walking 
between them. We all knew what is going to happen. The uniformed 
officers started beating us with everything they could. After 20 minutes 
of nonstop beatings my body didn’t react, I didn’t feel any pain 
anymore.
Courage is also required to be a journalist. Zogiani is now a freelance 
business reporter for a number of national and international news 
outlets.

Sample Balance 
Sheet
A balance sheet shows what assets and liabilities a company has and where the 
money came from to finance them (Chapter 18). It is simply a statement of 
what a company owns and owes at the point in time the accounts were pre-
pared. It is an evaluation put into black and white of a company’s worth. It lists 
the net worth of a company—all it owns, known as assets—and everything it 
owes, called liabilities.
What follows is an extract from the consolidated accounts of a leading beverage 
company in millions of euros.

Observations:  What the Numbers Tell Us
A big international group with complex finances, the enterprise portrayed 
in this balance sheet has grown through acquiring other companies. It has 
financed these purchases largely through borrowing: long-term debt, as listed in 
the sample balance sheet. The fixed assets (1,608 million euro) are small com-
pared to the intangible assets (10,341 million euro), which represent the extra 
cost or premium paid for control when making the acquisitions.
The notes to the accounts (not shown in a balance sheet, but journalists 
should look at the overall audited accounts) state that these intangible assets 
represent the acquisition of well-known beverage brands that have a domi-
nant market position.
Total assets (18,431 million euro) are greater than total liabilities (8,687 plus 
3,147 million euro). Current assets (5,546 million euro) exceed current liabilities 
(3,147 million euro) by a comfortable margin. The group is clearly solvent.
The level of long-term liabilities is high at 8,687 million euro compared to  
shareholders’ equity of 6,597 million euro, and this represents a risk if the group’s 
sales fall sharply. However, the group’s business is relatively stable and pro-
tected by strong brand identity. Consumers are unlikely to suddenly reduce 
their consumption of the group’s products even in an economic downturn. 
Another risk is whether the group will be able to replace the long-term loans 
when they become due for repayment. This is harder to do in an economic 
downturn.
This example is of a balance sheet. Reference to the company’s stability and 
brand identity comes from the full accounts and or annual report. But even 
the balance sheet points the way to good business stories.

217
Business Journalism
The company is stable financially and is international. Will it acquire and/or 
take over more companies? In which countries will it buy? Will its targets 
resist a takeover, so that the company will have to resort to a “hostile” bid? If 
not on the acquisition trail, will the company expand its range of beverages, or 
will it stage a marketing “push” for one or more of its brands?
Colorful stories can be uncovered in site visits. Visiting journalists to one of 
this group’s subsidiaries, located in the old Soviet Union, are told the story 
that the subsidiary produced the brandy favored by Sir Winston Churchill. 
Churchill noticed the quality of the brandy was falling and phoned Premier 
Stalin to ask why. It appeared the chief chemist had upset the Kremlin and been 
banished to Siberia. On Churchill’s complaint, Stalin had the man returned to 
the distillery, the quality of the brandy was maintained, and everyone was 
happy again.
Is this a true story? The company executives swear it’s fact.
Na zdorovie!

﻿
This book is dedicated to the hundreds of thousands of 
journalists worldwide who toil tirelessly and fearlessly, 
sometimes in very hostile conditions, to bring 
transparency, honesty, and veracity to the stories they 
report on, investigate, and write.
Special praise goes to those who have worked 
alongside me in difficult situations and volatile 
environments and who have become loyal friends and 
committed colleagues.

Preface
This short book was originally meant to be a guide for journalists working in 
those countries that have recently embraced democratic processes and are 
transiting to open market economies.
But it is also useful for student journalists, young journalists with little 
experience in a newsroom, and any journalists who are changing direction 
from general news reporting to the specialty of business and economic 
reporting—or from print to television or radio. Journalism students will find 
it useful as a primer for good journalistic practice and as an aid to their 
studies.
It is a short book, deliberately so.  There are many hefty volumes written by 
others on this and other media topics, which are suitable for those studying 
journalism at a higher level. This slender tome is designed for those who are 
already experiencing the rigors of journalistic practice—late nights, early 
mornings, and interrupted weekends—as well as those students who need a 
short and simple book to refer to quickly, especially when assignments are due.
It can also help those who have already learned that ill-tempered editors, 
critical publics, and embarrassments caused by lapses in concentration are 
the normal pressures of the profession they have chosen. It is designed to 
assist those who want a book to which they can make quick reference—a 
book that can stay with them when they are racing to meet a deadline, or 
running after a finance minister who is loath to talk.
This book is a combination of notes on good reporting practice, tips on 
practical reporting skills, and an assessment of the role of the media in a 
transitional economy. It also contains suggestions on specific knowledge that 
journalists should have in generally reporting business and the economy. It is 
not intended to be a complete instruction book on business reporting. Rather 
it focuses on those issues raised by many burgeoning journalists themselves. 
Some of these reporters are already business journalists, and others are 
those who have recognized the importance to civil society of accurate and 
impartial economic reporting.
The content of the book reflects many specific economic problems identified 
as being important to journalists in democracies struggling to develop an 
open market economy, and underscores how intelligent, thoughtful, and 
sensitive media should make the reporting of such issues a priority. 

Preface 
x
These prescriptions apply equally to journalists caught up in the chaos caused 
by the financial crisis in the latter part of the decade that began in 2000, when 
the major headlines were almost always about business, finance, banking and 
economies and the mess they were in. This is especially so following the 
specific global financial events of 2008, which spilled over into another year 
and a year after that and a year after.… The events in those years are likely 
to have a profound effect on the majority of global economies for many more 
years to come and will thus remain newsworthy.
The book is meant to be of help to journalists who are active in all countries and 
who have the responsibility of telling the civil population what is happening to 
their economies and how it affects them. Indeed, there is material contained 
in these pages that journalists just entering the profession—anywhere in the 
world—might find useful. I hope so.
Journalists are storytellers. But in telling the story, they not only need to 
tell it well but also make certain they are telling the facts as they find them 
and indeed as they understand them. The book therefore contains material 
on good journalistic practice, as well as specific advice on how to report on 
various elements that make up economic and business news.
Many news media enterprises in maturing democracies seem to forget the 
value of training. For that matter, it is often given low priority in Western 
countries. Sometimes editors think they are all-knowing and see the idea of 
instruction as an affront to their own experience and skills base. But business 
journalists know, or should know, that proper training schemes, refresher 
courses, and external performance monitoring are key in making any major 
corporate business successful. The training budget in large companies and in 
effective governments is generally substantial. It is surprising, therefore, that 
media companies in emerging economies are often resistant to training, as 
are smaller enterprises in the burgeoning Western media sector.
Getting back to basics and avoiding complacency is an important objective 
for all news media and should be pursued as an active policy. That is why I 
have included in this book elements on the basic principles of journalism. 
Those who have been reporters or newspeople for long periods of time are 
the first to acknowledge the usefulness and effectiveness of going back to 
basics. These are the journalists who become great reporters and don’t get 
left behind in a morass of mediocrity.
The book has two sections. The first has several short chapters on a number 
of key issues that business journalists should always have in the forefront of 
their minds, such as how to write a good news article or how to spot a story. 
The second section digs deeper into the knowledge and techniques required 
of a business journalist, such as understanding the basics of macroeconomics 
or corporate finance, and it is a more detailed guide to good practice and 
application of the business news discipline.

Preface
xi
The book is a guide. It does not purport to be an A–Z of business skills, 
economic know-how, or operational practices of business journalism. 
Becoming a top business and economic journalist requires patience in 
garnering deep knowledge from experts such as brokers, economists, 
analysts, and bankers. In other words, “doing it,” which is the industry mantra 
for becoming a good journalist, also applies to business journalism.
I hope this book helps in each individual’s development and creates the thirst 
for practicing business journalism, which many—I among them—believe to 
be the industry’s most exciting form of reporting.

staff who made this book possible. I also acknowledge Jeff Olson, who against 
the odds thought there was room for a book of this sort and persuaded  
his colleagues to publish it; my book editor Rita Fernando, who put up with 
a good deal of curmudgeonly behavior from me; and Jennifer Lynn, who 
reminded me that the differences in British and American English were no 
excuse for sloppy writing.
I also acknowledge all the other numerous training manuals and courses 
that address some of the issues raised in this book.
I am not saying anything new. I subscribe to the epitome of journalism 
stated in a UPI handbook of yesteryear:
Tell them.
• 
Remind them that you have told them.
• 
Then remind them that you have reminded them.
• 
This volume pays tribute to that adage and indeed is intended not so much 
as an original work but as a reminder of the basics and skills required of 
business and economic reporting.

And I thank the many restaurateurs, barmen, and waiters who filled with 
interesting chatter those lonely moments experienced by most journalists 
who work in the field.
I am grateful to you all.

A Brief History of 
Business Journalism
Business information was generally available in the popular coffeehouses of 
London and New York in the 18th and early 19th centuries simply by people 
talking to each other.  Those conversations gave rise to printed news pamphlets 
and eventually newspapers. The Financial Times was founded in 1888; and  
The Wall Street Journal, still America’s biggest selling newspaper, came out a 
year later. So it was business and trade that helped create the journalistic 
profession of which you are—or wish to be—part.
As trade began to rapidly increase, the great institutions began to grow. 
The coffeehouses were no longer good enough or reliable enough for trade 
purposes, so The Bank of England, the London Stock Exchange, The New York 
Stock Exchange, and the London Corn Market were established, which made 
the trading of goods and commodities more formal.
The first true business journalist was German-born Paul Julius Reuter, founder 
of the famous newswire service Reuters. He was a failed businessman when 
he arrived in Britain; but by 1851 he had a flourishing news business, supplying 
prices and information on corn crops from the great wheat-growing countries 
in central Europe to the commodities markets in London.
Reuter realized that whoever was the first to provide information on the 
wheat harvests from the corn belts of Europe to the London markets, so 
prices could be set, would provide a truly useful business news service—and a 
profitable one. Other companies in the same business of providing information 
to London about harvests on the great wheat-growing regions of Russia and 
Ukraine took several days to get such information back to Britain because they 
used transport over land to convey their reports. The telegraph cables only 
reached from London to Belgium, so Reuter replaced his regular messengers, 
who would deliver the news on the harvests from Eastern Europe to the wire 
heads, with carrier pigeons. These birds flew to the wire service offices in 
Belgium, where the information on commodities was passed on to London 
by wire. It now only took a day to get the information from countries such as 
Ukraine to Britain. Reuter became wealthy.
The first business news operation, which was to grow into a news and financial 
information Goliath, had started.

The First Business Newspapers
The early newspapers, precursors of the Financial Times and The Wall Street 
Journal, began to grow in both New York and London at about the same time 
as Reuter developed his market news centers, but for different reasons.
Coffeehouses as a venue for sharing news and information gained in popularity 
during the 17th century and became forums for business information in the 
18th and early 19th centuries. The private gentlemen’s clubs of London 
served a similar purpose for the rich and titled. To this day, the dining rooms 
of London clubs are known as the “coffee” rooms. From that came printed 
news pamphlets and eventually newspapers. In New York, however, the famous 
pamphleteer Tom Paine took fledgling newspapers to new heights in urging 
the colonists to rebel against the English crown. The issue was taxation, so 
Paine was an early business journalist as well as a rebel.
But now the great institutions were beginning to grow. The Bank of England, 
the London Stock Exchange, the London Corn Market, and the trading of 
other goods and commodities became more formal. Trading moved out of 
the coffeehouses into these institutions and so did the news about prices and 
buyers. The business press was born.
20th- and 21st-Century Business Press
Although London was a great marketplace, the social revolutions of the late 
19th century curbed open market policies and legislation far more in Britain 
than in the United States. As a consequence, America developed as an open 
trading nation far more rapidly than London. The average 20th-century 
American citizen owned stocks and shares, played the market, and made 
private investments in business.
This revolution didn’t really happen in Britain until the early 1980s with the 
open market policies of Margaret Thatcher, who encouraged ordinary people 
to own shares, especially in newly privatized enterprises. As a result, business 
news was far more prominent in the New York Times than the London Times.
That didn’t mean that business news wasn’t needed in the UK: far from it. 
But ordinary general newspapers conveyed that information until the advent 
of the Financial Times (FT) in 1888. Even then, it was the turn of the century 
before the FT flourished as a business newspaper.
This book makes much of the recent financial crisis of the past decade. 
However, one of the most famous about-faces of open market policy had 
tragic results in 1920s America.
For a variety of reasons, recession set into the US economy. The press of 
the day urged the government to do something about it and hounded the 
administration into passing the Hawley–Smoot Tariff Act of 1930. This act

created legislation that raised American tariffs on overseas goods to such an 
excessive level that there were few imports. The theory was that the United 
States was big enough to produce its own natural resources and to contain 
an internal market big enough to support a manufacturing sector that would 
produce its own goods and create significant employment.
Such policies rarely work and, in this instance, they were a huge disaster, 
triggering the Great Depression in the United States and creating such poverty 
in other countries that the whole industrialized world was affected. Nowhere 
was this more true than in Germany, where unemployment stoked the rise 
of National Socialism, which triggered the start of the Second World War. It 
was a shameful period in history, and the involvement of the business media 
in badgering politicians to introduce protectionist trade policies put a black 
mark against journalism for several decades afterward.
In the UK, meanwhile, socialism gained ground. After the Second World War, 
trade unions took a giant grip of business, including newspapers, radio, and 
television. The concept of a closed shop—which means a worker needed a 
job to be a member of a union but could not get a job unless a member of a 
union—led to cronyism, corruption, and the right to manage businesses being 
taken away from management and effectively handed over to trade union 
officials. Britain became uncompetitive, with new technology scorned and 
workers’ rights becoming more important than efficient business practice. 
Vast numbers of people were required to produce newspapers and television 
programs because trade unions insisted on overtime restrictions and dictated 
which employees could write and report news and who could use technology 
such as film and videotape editing machines, so that growth in the media 
sector was stunted and the news industry began to decay. TV reporting crews 
in New York, for example, were composed of three people; while in Britain, 
news gathering took double and sometimes treble that amount of people.
That changed in the late 1970s with the election of Britain’s first female Prime 
Minister, the firebrand Margaret Thatcher. Determined to return Britain 
to being a strong trading power, she confronted the various trade union 
organizations, sometimes violently, until most restrictive practices disappeared. 
She also introduced a massive privatization policy, selling off most state-owned 
enterprises and making ordinary citizens shareholders.
The advent of this new open-market policy in the UK saw a deregulation of the 
electronic media. As a consequence, radio and television programs—and indeed 
channels that were forerunners to such TV stations as CNBC— mushroomed. 
And because many ordinary folk now had an interest in the fortunes of major 
businesses by virtue of owning shares in them, interest in business news  
grew rapidly.
Unfortunately, TV business news is expensive and many programs closed down 
with the recession of the late 1980s. They flourished again with a resurgent 
economy, only to see sharp cutbacks, some bankruptcies, and curtailment of

activity in the new millennium. Analysts forecast that business news would 
bounce back as the economy improved, and these forecasts proved accurate; 
media, especially business media, have flourished in the second decade of the 21st 
century. However, traditional media are facing a new challenge from new media, 
online journalism, and the new fashion of getting information off the Web.
Other developments worth noting have added to the importance of business 
media over the years. Satellite delivery of text and pictures has helped the 
speed of information. The Web has enabled widespread distribution of business 
information, and when television properly conquers the challenge of how to 
properly use the Web as a distribution platform, which is not too far off now, 
the impact will be even greater.
Despite these developments in delivery technologies, business journalism is 
not going away. Quite the contrary: business media are very important to the 
operation of stock markets. When companies are publicly owned—that is, 
when shares are held outside the company—legislation demands full and open 
disclosure of information. Business agencies such as Dow Jones and Reuters 
are extremely important to this disclosure, and both the stock markets and 
individual companies work closely with them to ensure that information is 
released at exactly the same time to avoid any charges of concealment. As 
stock markets spring up over the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Central Europe, 
Asia, and the Middle East, this relationship is becoming increasingly important 
to public relations practitioners in industries listed on stock exchanges. 
Related media activity is seeing a boom.
The business press has become very influential in modern financial markets. 
It can deliver news at the speed of Superman, without having to pause in a 
telephone booth for a change of underwear. As top financial agency reporter 
Randolph Walerius points out in this book, a fraction of a second can be vital 
to how markets react to the release of company or economic news. Media 
provide the conduit for distributing that news, analyzing it, and even forming 
conclusions from it. Business media act as monitors to companies inasmuch 
as they can focus on weak or ineffective management, growth of competitors, 
factors that can alter prices or costs such as hurricanes, famine, drought, wars, 
or other disasters that may disrupt the activities of a free and open market.
If Reuter had had computers rather than pigeons, perhaps the history of 
the business press might have been a lot different. But he didn’t, and despite 
that he changed the face of business reports and thus changed the nature of 
business reporting.
One thing is for certain: he found being a business journalist in the 1800s just 
as heady and exciting as I find it today. My hat is off to Paul Julius Reuter, and 
a plague on those faceless bureaucrats who still want to get rid of pigeons in 
Trafalgar Square!
