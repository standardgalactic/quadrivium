Preface
Pedagogically, the fundamental principles are the foundation for lifelong learning.
Thus, this book through a simple treatment can provide students of aerospace/
aeronautical and mechanical engineering with a deep understanding of both aircraft
and spacecraft propulsions. The development of aircrafts in only one century is far
beyond expectations.
December 1903 was the dawn of human-engineered ﬂight when the Wright
Brothers ﬂew their ﬁrst ﬂights that lasted for a few seconds in Ohio, USA. This
ﬁrst aircraft was powered by a single piston engine and had no passengers, neither
did it have a fuselage nor landing gears. It is extremely amazing that in 2011 over
2.8 billion passengers were carried by the world’s commercial airlines via more
than 222,500 aircrafts powered by more than 260,000 different types of aero
engines. Some of these aircrafts can carry as many as 800 passengers for more
than 15 h of ﬂying time, while others can ﬂy at supersonic speeds. In 2015, the
number of passengers exceeded 3.3 billion. Now, piston engines are no longer the
single actor in propulsion theater, though they are still dominant! Turbojet engines
were the ﬁrst jet engines invented in the late 1930s and took a reasonable share in
military and civil-powered ﬂights for nearly two decades. In the late 1950s and
early 1960s, turbofan engines (or bypass turbojet engines) were invented. These are
the present prevailing engines which power faster, quieter, cleaner, and heavier
aircrafts. In the 1950s also two other engine types, namely, turboprop and turbo-
shaft, were invented to power commercial airliners and military transport aircrafts
and rotorcrafts.
Due to the rapid advance in air transportation as well as military and intelligence
missions, aircraft and rocket propulsion has become an essential part of engineering
education. Propulsion is the combined aero-thermal science for aircrafts and
rockets. Propulsion has both macro- and microscales. Macroscale handles the
performance and operation of aircrafts and rockets during different missions,
while microscale is concerned with component design including both rotary mod-
ules (i.e., compressor, fan, pump, and turbine) and stationary modules (i.e., intake,
combustor, afterburner, and nozzle).

The primary aim of this text is to give students a thorough grounding in both the
theory and practice of propulsion. It discusses the design, operation, installation and
several inspections, repair, and maintenance aspects of aircraft and rocket engines.
This book serves as a text for undergraduate and ﬁrst year graduate students in
mechanical, aeronautical, aerospace, avionics, and aviation engineering depart-
ments. Moreover, it can be used by practicing engineers in aviation and gas turbine
industries. Background in ﬂuid mechanics and thermodynamics at fundamental
levels is assumed. The book also provides educators with comprehensive solved
examples, practical engine case studies, intelligent unsolved problems, and design
projects. The material of this book is the outcome of industrial, research, and
educational experience for more than 40 years in numerous civil, military institu-
tions, and companies of 9 countries including the USA, Russia, Austria, UK,
Belgium, China, and Japan as well as Egypt.
The book is composed of 11 chapters and 4 appendices. The ﬁrst ten chapters
handle air-breathing engines, while non-air-breathing (or rocket) engines are ana-
lyzed in Chap. 11.
Chapter 1 is rather a unique one! It provides a rigorous classiﬁcation of all types
of aircrafts and its sources of power. The ﬁrst part classiﬁes aircrafts as aerostats/
aerodynes, ﬁxed wing/rotary wing (or rotorcrafts), and hybrid ﬁxed/rotary wings as
well as all other lift aircrafts (ﬂapping wing or ornithopter, lifting body, and fan
wing). The second part handles power plant types. Power plants belong to two main
groups, namely, external and internal combustion engines. External combustion
engines are steam, Stirling, and nuclear engines. Internal combustion engines are
further classiﬁed as shaft and reaction engines. Shaft engine group is either of the
intermittent combustion types (Wankel and piston) or continuous combustion types
(turboprop, turboshaft, and propfan). Reaction engines are either of the athodyd or
turbine engines. Athodyd engines include ramjet, scramjet, and pulsejet (valved,
valveless, and pulse detonation types). Finally, turbine-based engines include
turbojet, turbofan, and turbo-ramjet engines.
Chapters 2 and 3 emphasize that a few fundamental physical principles, rightly
applied, can provide a deep understanding of operation and performance of aircrafts
and space vehicles.
Chapter 2 provides a review of basic laws of compressible ﬂow with heat and
friction. Conservation of mass, momentum, moment of momentum, and energy
equations applied to open control volume are reviewed. A review for aspects of
normal and oblique shock waves and Fanno and Rayleigh ﬂows follows. Flow in
diffusers in aircrafts as well as ﬂow in nozzles in both aircrafts and rockets are
discussed. Standard atmosphere is highlighted to emphasize variations of air prop-
erties at different altitudes.
Chapter 3 relies upon governing formulae reviewed in Chap. 2 in driving the
different performance parameters of jet propulsion, namely, thrust force, operation
efﬁciencies (propulsive, thermal, and overall), speciﬁc impulse, and fuel consump-
tion. Other parameters that couple aircraft and engine performance like aircraft

Preface

range and endurance are presented. Analysis of aircraft mission, route planning, and
non-return point are next highlighted.
Chapter 4 provides the necessary analyses of piston engines and propellers.
Though piston engine was the ﬁrst in-ﬂight air-breathing engine employed by the
Wright brothers in 1903, it maintains its strong existence until now. It represents
more than 70 % of present-day air-breathing engines. They are extensively used in
small ﬁxed wing, sport aircrafts, UAVs, and lighter than air ﬂying vehicles, as well
as many rotorcrafts. Unfortunately, it is overlooked in most available propulsion
books. A concise analysis of power cycles for two- and four-stroke engines,
compression or spark ignition (CI and SI), and Wankel engines as well as turbo-
and superchargers is reviewed for power and thermal efﬁciency optimization.
Piston engines cannot generate the necessary propulsive force for a ﬂying vehicle
on its own. Thus, it should be coupled to propellers. Classiﬁcations of propellers
based on various aspects are deﬁned. Propeller’s power and thrust force coefﬁcients
are deﬁned using simple aerodynamic theories (momentum, modiﬁed momentum,
and blade-element).
Chapter 5 is devoted to athodyd (nonrotating modules) engines, namely,
pulsejet, ramjet, and scramjet engines. All cannot produce thrust force at zero ﬂight
speed, so other propulsive methods are used for takeoff operation. Each engine is
composed of intake, combustion chamber, and nozzle. An analysis of ideal and real
cycles as well as performance parameters of all engines is identiﬁed. Pulsejet
engine is an internal combustion engine that produces thrust intermittently and is
either of the valved or valveless type. Pulse detonation engine (PDE) is evolved in
the last decade. PDE promises higher fuel efﬁciency (even compared with turbofan
jet engines). Ramjet engine represents the ﬁrst invented continuous combustion
engine. It is used in both aircrafts and rockets. The third engine analyzed in this
chapter is scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet). Combustion takes place in
supersonic airﬂow. Thus it can ﬂy at extremely high speeds (NASA X-43A reached
Mach 9.6). Finally, dual-mode (Ram-Scram) combustion engine is analyzed.
Chapters 6 and 7 treat air-breathing engines incorporating rotating modules.
Chapter 6 handles turbine-based engines (turbojet, turbofan, and turbo-ramjet),
while Chap. 7 treats shaft-based engines (turboprop, turboshaft, and propfan).
One of the objectives of both chapters is to exercise students to practice realistic
engines, build conﬁdence, and a sense of professionalism. Both chapters start with a
historical prospective and a classiﬁcation of each engine. Next, thermodynamic and
performance analyses for ideal and real cycles are introduced and further explained
via solved examples. Chapter 6 starts by the ﬁrst ﬂown jet engine, namely, turbojet
engine, which was coinvented in the 1930s by British and German activities.
Analyses of single and double spools in the presence and absence of afterburner
are described. Though rarely used in airliners or military planes in present days, it is
still used in micro turbojets and turbojets powering rockets during sustained ﬂight.
Turbofan engines are continuing its superiority for most present commercial
airliners and military planes as well as some rockets for sustained ﬂight. A unique
classiﬁcation of the numerous types of this engine based on fan location

(forward/aft), bypass ratio (low/high), number of spools (single/double/triple),
number of nozzles (single/double), fan/turbine coupling (geared/ungeared), and
ﬁnally afterburner (present/absent) is given. After detailed analyses for some (not
all) types of turbofan, the third engine, namely, turbo-ramjet, is presented. It is
found in two conﬁgurations: wraparound or above/under types. An analysis of its
single mode or combined mode is precisely deﬁned.
Chapter 7 is conﬁned to shaft-based engines in which performance is controlled
by shaft power rather than thrust force. Also, its economy is governed by brake-
speciﬁc fuel consumption rather than thrust-speciﬁc fuel consumption. Turboprop
engines power manned and unmanned aircrafts. It may be of the puller (tractor) or
pusher types. It may be also either a single or double spool. This section is ended by
an analogy between turboprop and turbofan engines. Next, turboshaft engines
which mainly power helicopters are classiﬁed and analyzed. Exhaust speeds are
no longer important in this type of engines as all available energy is converted into
shaft power. Finally, propfan or unducted fan (UDF) engines, normally described as
ultrahigh bypass (UHP) ratio engine, are classiﬁed based on fan location (forward/
aft) and numbers of fan stages (single/double). A thermodynamic analysis of this
engine is presented for the ﬁrst time in this book. It combines features from both
turbofan and turboprop engines.
Chapter 8 presents aero-/thermodynamic analyses of stationary modules of jet
engines, namely, intakes, combustion chamber, afterburner, and nozzle. At ﬁrst,
different methods for power plant installation (wing/fuselage/tail, or combinations)
are discussed as it has a direct inﬂuence on air ﬂow rates into intakes and ingestion
of foreign objects into the engines. Also, intakes for ﬁxed and rotary wing aircrafts
as well as rockets are described. Moreover, subsonic and supersonic intakes are
reviewed for optimum jet engine performance. Intake geometry and its perfor-
mance are also presented. A review of combustion chambers including types,
chemistry of combustion, aerodynamics, and thermodynamics of ﬂow in its differ-
ent elements is presented. Afterburners in turbojets/turbofans in supersonic aircrafts
are analyzed. Different types of aviation fuels and biofuels as a future jet fuel for
green aviation are examined. The exhaust system is treated here in a general scope.
Convergent and convergent divergent (de Laval) nozzles are analyzed. Moreover,
thrust reverse and thrust vectoring are reviewed. Noise control for nozzles is given.
Turbomachinery (i.e., fans, compressors, and turbines) are treated in Chaps. 9
and 10. The objective of both chapters is to provide a simpliﬁed understanding of its
aerodynamics, thermal, and stresses in both compressors and turbines. In Chap. 9,
different types of compressors are ﬁrst identiﬁed, but only centrifugal and axial ﬂow
types are analyzed. The three main components of centrifugal compressor, namely,
impeller, stator, and volute/scroll, are ﬁrst analyzed taking into consideration their
different types. Positive/negative prewhirl is also presented. Concerning axial
compressor, the aerodynamics of single and multistages is reviewed. A perfor-
mance map for both compressors is employed in identifying design and off-design
operation. Lastly, different mechanisms for avoiding surge and rotating stall are
discussed.

Preface

Chapter 10 treats radial and axial ﬂow turbines. Radial turbine is to a great extent
similar to centrifugal compressor. The aerodynamics and thermodynamics of its
components (i.e., inlet, nozzle, rotor, and outlet duct) are presented. Next, single
and multistage axial ﬂow turbines are treated with either impulse or reaction
blading. Mechanical design and cooling techniques are reviewed. Finally, turbine
map and off-design performance of both turbines are discussed. Matching between
compressors and turbines in both gas generators and jet engines ends this chapter.
Rocket propulsion is discussed in Chap. 11. It starts with a brief history of
rocketry followed by classiﬁcations of rockets based on type, launching mode,
range, engine, warhead, and guidance systems. Rocket performance parameters
(i.e., thrust force, effective exhaust velocity, speciﬁc impulse, thrust coefﬁcient, and
combustion chamber pressure drop) are derived in closed forms similar to those in
Chap. 3 for air-breathing engines. A comprehensive section for multistaging is
presented. Finally, an analysis of exhaust system (i.e., nozzle geometry, exhaust
velocity, and structural coefﬁcient) is given. Both chemical and nonchemical rocket
engines are reviewed. Chemical rockets are further divided into liquid, solid, and
hybrid rockets. Solid propellant types, combustion chamber, and nozzles are
deﬁned. In liquid propellant rockets, a turbopump is added. A hybrid rocket
combines liquid and solid propellant systems. Nonchemical rockets including
nuclear heating and electrically powered and electrothermal, electromagnetic, and
electrostatic thrusters are reviewed.
The book ends with 4 appendices. These lists chronicle details of piston,
turbojet, and turbofan engines, as well as milestones for rockets.

Classiﬁcations of Aircrafts and Propulsion
Systems
1.1
Introduction
Aircraft engine is also denoted as aero engine, airbreathing engines, or aircraft
power plant. It acts as the heart of aircraft (being the only source of power in
aircrafts) similar to human’s heart. The desire to ﬂy is as old as the known history of
man. Winged gods were plenty among all kinds of societies the man started to form
in the early ages. These winged ﬁgures or ﬁgurines are shown on many temples of
Egyptian civilization some 5000 B.C., Sumerian Civilization 3500–2500 B.C and
Hittite civilization 3000–1000 B.C. Many of these idols of early civilization carried
certain common features, namely the powerful body of a lion (representing leader-
ship on land), head of a noble man (putting these idols on a more humane
perspective), and wings of an eagle for mastering air.
There are also some interesting artifacts found among ancient ruins. A 6 inch
wooden model of an aircraft featuring fuselage, wing, and tail (exactly similar to
twentieth century civil transports) was found in one of the tombs in Saqqara, Egypt,
that dates back to 200 BC (Fig. 1.1).
An ornament for a golden delta wing aircraft model dates back to 500–800 A.D.
that is typical to F 102 jet ﬁghter of the 1950s was found in Columbia (Fig. 1.2).
Also a golden model found in Central and South America that is identical to
Grumman Aircraft X-29 (Fig. 1.3).
The axiom saying that “man cannot dream or imagine something that is not a
part of his real life experience” makes us puzzled how such early civilizations that
knew nothing about ﬂight principals could produce such models that carry present
features of aircrafts and same fuselage, wing, and tail construction?!
Flight story is long dated to several 100 years B.C. It started by mankind’s
dream of ﬂight by imitating birds. History recorded some distinct cases. The ﬁrst
was due to Daedalus (a famous architect) and his son Icarus who were prisoned in
eighteenth century B.C in Crete. Daedalus built wings for himself and Icarus,
fashioned with feathers held together with wax. Myth states that Icarus ﬂying too

close to the sun god Helios, the wax melted from the heat and he fell to his death.
Another described case also is due to Abbas Ibn Fernas, an Arabic Mathematician
and scientist who lived in Cordoba (810–887 AC) and could ﬂy after jumping
from a tower. However, ignoring the contribution of the tails of birds in ﬂight
control, he fell down and was hurt (but did not die) as he tried to return to ground.
Several Turkish unsuccessful trials were recorded in the last centuries. The author
of this book, in his previous book [1], chronicled ﬂight story in terms of milestones

for both aircraft and engine inventions beginning with Leonardo da Vinci up
through the twenty-ﬁrst century. This book integrated with the previous one [1]
provides a thorough understanding of engine propulsion concepts, including the
performance of aero engines. Author of the present book introduces propulsion
systems in a rather new ﬂavor to both aviation and aerospace industries. Integrated
with aircrafts, appropriate propulsion systems will be identiﬁed. An innovatory
classiﬁcation for both military and civil aircrafts will be given. Next, classiﬁca-
tions for aero engines will be followed. Appropriate power plants for each
category of airplanes will be also highlighted.
1.2
Classiﬁcations of Aircrafts
1.2.1
General
An aircraft may be deﬁned as a vehicle which is able to ﬂy by being supported by
the air, or in general, the atmosphere of a planet [2]. An aircraft counters the force of
gravity by using either static lift or dynamic lift [3]. Although rockets and missiles
also travel through the atmosphere, most are not considered aircraft because they
use rocket thrust instead of aerodynamics as the primary means of lift. However, a
cruise missile has to be considered as an aircraft because it relies on a lifting wing or
fuselage/body. Based on method of lift, aircrafts may be classiﬁed as either lighter
than air (AEROSTATS) or heavier than air (AERODYNES) (Fig. 1.4).
1.2.2
Aerostats
Aerostats use buoyancy to ﬂoat in the air in much the same way that ships ﬂoat on
the water. They are characterized by one or more large gasbags or canopies, ﬁlled
with a relatively low density gas such as helium, hydrogen or hot air, which is less
dense than the surrounding air. Aerostats may be further subdivided into powered
and unpowered types. Unpowered types are kite which was invented in China
500 B.C., sky lanterns (small hot air balloons; second type of aircraft to ﬂy as
invented 300 B.C.), balloons, and blimps.
A powered aerostat mostly denoted as airship or dirigible can be steered and
propelled through the air using rudders and propellers or other thrust. The main
types of airship are non-rigid, semi-rigid, and rigid. Non-rigid (sometimes denoted
blimps) are small airships without internal skeletons. Semi-rigid airships are
slightly larger and have some form of internal support such as a ﬁxed keel. An
example for rigid airship with full skeletons is Zeppelin. Although airships are no
longer used for passenger transport, they are still used for other purposes such as
advertising, sightseeing, surveillance, and research [4]. As demonstrated in Fig. 1.4,
1.2

a blimp may be unpowered as well as powered. Figure 1.5 illustrates both
unpowered (balloon) and powered (Zeppelin) aerostats.
1.2.3
Aerodynes
Aerodynes, or heavier than air vehicles, resemble almost all types of aircrafts. It
pushes air or gas in one direction, so that a reaction occurs (by Newton’s laws of
motion) that pushes the aircraft in the other direction. There are four groups of
aerodynes, namely, ﬁxed wing aircrafts, rotorcrafts, hybrid ﬁxed/rotary wing, and a
fourth group relying upon other methods for generating lift. For ﬁxed wing aircraft
(generally denoted as airplane or aeroplane), aerodynamic lift is generated by

forward movement of wings, while for rotorcraft lift is generated by spinning wing-
shaped rotors (sometimes called rotary wings). Fixed wing and rotorcraft types may
be further divided into powered and unpowered (gliders) types, as will be described
in details below. Rotorcrafts may also be divided into same categories of powered
and unpowered types, e.g. helicopters and autogyro, respectively. The third group,
namely, hybrid ﬁxed/rotary wing aircrafts, is sometimes identiﬁed as compound
rotorcraft and may include additional thrust engines or propellers and static lifting
surfaces. This group has several types, namely, tilt-wing, tiltrotor, mono tiltrotor,
mono-tilt-rotor rotary-ring, and coleopter.
The fourth group may be subdivided into three groups, namely: lifting body,
ﬂapping-Wing (Ornithopter), and FanWing. Lifting body conﬁguration has an
aircraft body shape to produce lift, e.g. Martin-Marietta X-24. Powered lift types
rely on engine-derived lift for vertical operation either in takeoff, landing, or both.
An ornithopter (from Greek ornithos “bird” and pteron “wing”) is an aircraft that
ﬂies by ﬂapping its wings. The FanWing is a recent innovation (starting 2005 in
United Kingdom) and represents a completely new class of aircraft. It uses a ﬁxed
wing with a cylindrical fan mounted spanwise just above the wing. As the fan spins,
it creates airﬂow backwards over the upper surface of the wing creating lift.
In the succeeding sections heavier than air vehicles or aerodynes will be
discussed in details.
1.2.4
Fixed Wing Aircrafts
1.2.4.1
General Classiﬁcations
Fixed wing aircrafts are further classiﬁed as either powered or unpowered vehicles
(Fig. 1.6). Unpowered types may be next subdivided into six types, namely

gliders, hang gliders, paragliders, sailplanes, kites, and space shuttle in its return
mission. Powered aircrafts are next classiﬁed based on several aspects. Based on
the number of wings, it is mono-plane, biplane, or tri-plane. Based on geometry, it
is ﬁxed, variable (swept-back wings), or tailless as illustrated in Fig. 1.7. Swept
back wings are adopted in some military aircrafts. Wings are swept back when
aircraft ﬂies in supersonic speeds. By tailless aircraft, it is meant an aircraft
without horizontal tail.
Finally based on wing type, ﬁxed wing aircrafts may be classiﬁed as conven-
tional, ﬂying wing, blended wing body (BWB), and hybrid wing body (HWB).
Figure 1.8 illustrates blended wing body (BWB), while Fig. 1.9 illustrates a ﬂying
wing.
Based on takeoff and landing (TOL), they may be classiﬁed as either conven-
tional or enhanced. Enhanced TOL types may be further divided into four cate-
gories, namely: Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL), Short Take Off and

Landing (STOL), Vertical and/or Short Take-Off and Landing (VSTOL), and
Short Take Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL). A tailsitter is a type of VTOL
aircraft that launches and lands on its tail, something akin to a Buck Rogers type
rocket, such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-X Delta Clipper. One of the most
famous examples of this type of aircraft is the Ryan X-13 Vertijet. Among the
propeller-driven versions were the Lockheed XFV and the Convair XFY Pogo. It
is important here to state some aircraft types may belong to more than one
category of this group of enhanced TOL. As an example Harrier aircraft belongs
to both VTOL and V/STOL types. This is not a unique case, but it is severally
repeated in other classiﬁcations hereafter. Figure 1.10 illustrates four types of
enhanced TOL aircrafts.
Furthermore, based also on takeoff and landing, ﬁxed wing aircrafts may
operate from land or sea carriers. A third classiﬁcation based on takeoff and
landing deﬁnes land, sea, and amphibious planes. A seaplane is a ﬁxed-wing
aircraft capable of taking off and landing (alighting) on water, while seaplanes
which can also take-off and land on airﬁelds are a small subclass called Amphib
ian aircraft (Fig. 1.11). Seaplanes and amphibians are usually divided into two
categories based on their technological characteristics: ﬂoatplanes and ﬂying
boats, which are generally far larger and can carry far more. These aircrafts
were sometimes called hydroplanes.
Finally, ﬁxed wings are seen in both civilian and military aircrafts.

1.2.4.2
Civil Aircrafts
As outlined above, ﬁxed wings aircrafts may be either classiﬁed as civil or military
types. Here civil aircrafts will be further discussed. It is decomposed into different
groups, namely, commercial transport, agriculture, trainer, ﬁreﬁghting, experimen-
tal, research, search and rescue as well as sea/amphibious planes (Fig. 1.12).

1.2.4.2.1
Agricultural Aircrafts
Agricultural aircrafts (Fig. 1.13) are aircrafts that have been built or converted for
agricultural use – usually aerial application of pesticides (crop dusting) or fertilizer
(aerial topdressing); in these roles, they are referred to as “crop dusters” or “top
dressers” [5].

1.2.4.2.2
Trainer
A trainer is an aircraft used to develop piloting or navigational skills in ﬂight crew.
Civilian pilots are normally trained in a light aircraft, with two or more seats to
allow for student and instructor. The two seating conﬁgurations for trainer aircraft
are pilot and instructor side by side or in tandem, usually with the pilot in front and
the instructor behind [6]. Training has two phases, namely, basic and advanced.
Fig. 1.14 illustrates two conﬁgurations of trainer aircrafts.
1.2.4.2.3
Fireﬁghting Aircraft
Fireﬁghting aircraft is used in aerial ﬁreﬁghting and normally employed for
steep, rocky, high, and unsafe areas. Airtankers or water bombers are ﬁxed-

wing aircraft ﬁtted with tanks that can be ﬁlled on the ground at an air tanker
base (like C-130 and Grumman S-2 T) or, in the case of ﬂying boats (CL 215
and Martin Mars Bomber) and amphibious aircraft, by skimming water from
lakes, reservoirs, or large rivers. Figure 1.15 illustrates CL 215 aircraft
dropping water. Air-tankers may also use non-toxic retardants like ammonium
sulfate, which will then act as fertilizers to help the re-growth of plants after
the ﬁre.
1.2.4.2.4
Experimental Aircraft
An experimental aircraft is an aircraft that has not yet been fully proven in ﬂight
[7]. Often, this implies that new aerospace technologies are being tested on the
aircraft. Experimental aircraft is also a speciﬁc term referring to an aircraft ﬂown
with an experimental category Airworthiness Certiﬁcate. A notable example of an
experimental aircraft is the Rutan Voyager (Fig. 1.16). It is the ﬁrst aircraft to ﬂy
around the world without stopping or refueling. Model 76 Voyager powered by a
piston engine.

1.2.4.2.5
Research
Research aircrafts can be identiﬁed as two main types, already manufactured
aircraft or new designed ones. The ﬁrst may be employed either as an airborne
laboratory (DC-8) or in new projects for testing some operating conditions (tran-
sonic, sonic boom, and supersonic researches), ﬂight procedure, and so on. The
second is a newly designed aircrafts that incorporate developments in aerodynamic
characteristics, material, equipments, systems (stall speed warning), and engine.
Centurion, Helios, and pathﬁnder are three types for solar-powered aircrafts.
1.2.4.2.6
Search and Rescue Aircrafts (SAR)
Search and rescue aircrafts (SAR) is the search for and provision of aid to people
who are in distress or imminent danger like survivors of aircraft downed at sea as
well as sailors and passengers of sea vessels in distress. An example for such
aircrafts is de Havilland Canada
DHC-5 Buffalo. Air ambulance may be included to this category. It is used for
emergency medical assistance in situations where either a traditional ambulance
cannot reach the scene easily or quickly enough, or the patient needs to be
transported over a distance or terrain that makes air transportation the most prac-
tical transport. King Air, King Air 200, and Pilatus PC 12/45 are examples for air
ambulance aircrafts.
1.2.4.2.7
Seaplanes
Seaplanes are aircrafts capable for operating from sea only while amphibious ones
can operate from both sea and land as described above. Examples of early
Grumman’s amphibian family are single-engine biplane G-22, twin-engine G-21,
G-44, and G-73.

1.2.4.2.8
Commercial Transport
Commercial transport is an airplane used by airliner to deliver passengers or cargo
(freight) for a fare or fee. Passenger aircrafts are now one of the mostly used
methods of human transportation and includes numerous types as well be discussed
later.
Cargo Aircrafts
A cargo aircraft (also known as freight aircraft or freighter) is designed or
converted for the carriage of goods or mail rather than passengers [8]. Cargo
airlines are a special category of air service that has grown rapidly in the last
three decades to offer express delivery of priority freight. They are usually devoid
of passenger amenities, and generally feature one or more large doors for the
loading and unloading of cargo. Aircraft designed for cargo ﬂight use have a
number of features, refer to Fig. 1.17, that distinguish them from conventional
passenger aircraft: a “fat” looking fuselage as displayed in Airbus A300 Beluga
Supertransporter, a high-wing to allow the cargo area to sit near the ground like

Antonov An 225, a large number of wheels to allow it to land at unprepared
locations, and a high-mounted tail to allow cargo to be driven directly into and
off the aircraft and most important additional strengthening on key structural areas.
Moreover, there is a wide range of aircraft suitable for all kinds of cargo ﬂights,
short-, medium-, and long-haul. Based on its capacity, it ranges from smaller
aircraft performing short notice ﬂights carrying vital spare parts up to large cargo
aircraft able to transport any voluminous goods
Transports Aircrafts
Transport aircrafts are also called airliners or airplanes. The ﬁrst scheduled airline
commenced operation in 1914 between Tampa and St. Petersburg in Florida, USA.
Passengers travelled the 35 km distance in a ﬂying boat.
Transport aircrafts may be classiﬁed – based on ﬂight speed – to supersonic
transport (SST) and subsonic/transonic types (Fig. 1.18). Airplanes that are
powered by jet engines are also called jetliners. Thus Airliners combine both piston
engines aircrafts as well as jet engines ones. A supersonic transport (SST) is
designed to transport passengers at speeds greater than the speed of sound. The
only SSTs to see regular service were Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144
(Fig. 1.19). Both are powered by afterburning turbojet engines. The ﬁrst passenger
ﬂight of the Tu-144 was in June 1978, and the last ﬂight Concorde’s was on
November 26, 2003.
Extensive research work by NASA staff is performed to introduce hypersonic
transports (will ﬂy in Mach number equal or greater than 5) in the coming decade.
Subsonic/transonic aircrafts are described in details in [9]. Their different classes

are private (small), executive jet (corporate), commuter, regional, short haul,
medium haul, and long haul.
Small Transport
Small transports (sometimes identiﬁed as private or air taxi) are either single-
engine or twin-engine aircrafts. Examples for them are Cessna 172 and Beechcraft
58 TC Baron respectively, and both are powered by piston engines. Number of
passengers for both types is three and six, respectively. Executive or corporate jet is
private or charter aircraft. It is either powered by turboprop or jet engines. Exam-
ples are Raytheon-Beechcraft King Air B300, Cessna Citation II, and Gulfstream.
Figure 1.20 illustrates Gulfstream G650 T2 which ﬁrst ﬂight was on February
25, 2010.
Commuter
A Commuter aircraft carry 19 or fewer passenger seats also sometimes called
feederliners, depending on their size, engines, and seating conﬁgurations.
Depending on local and national regulations, a commuter aircraft may not qualify
as an airliner and may not be subject to the regulations applied to larger aircraft.
Members of this class of aircraft normally lack such amenities as lavatories and
galleys and typically do not carry a ﬂight attendant as an aircrew member. The

Beechcraft 1900, for example, has only 19 seats and powered by twin turboprop
engines (Fig. 1.21). Other aircraft in this category are the Fairchild Metro, Jetstream
31/41, IPTN CN-235, and Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, which are all powered
by twin turboprop engines.

Regional Airliner
A regional airliner is a small airliner designed to ﬂy up to 100 passengers, and
usually feeding larger carriers’ hubs from small markets. This class of airliners is
typically ﬂown by the regional airlines that are either contracted by or subsidiaries
of the larger airlines. It may be powered by turbofans or turboprops. These airliners,
though smaller than aircraft operated by major airlines, are equipped with lavatories
and have a ﬂight attendant to look after the in-ﬂight needs of the passengers.
Typical aircraft in this category are the Embraer ERJ 145 powered by two turbofan
engines (Fig. 1.22). Other aircrafts of this category are Bombardier CRJ series and
“Q” (DASH-8) series powered by turbofan engine, ATR 42/72 and Saab 340/2000.
The last two aircrafts are powered by turboprop engines. Airlines and their partners
sometimes use these for short ﬂights between small hubs or for bringing passengers
to hub cities where they may board larger aircraft.
In aviation, the ﬂight length is deﬁned as the time airborne during a ﬂight. Short
haul ﬂight is deﬁned as a ﬂight less than 3 h in length, while a medium haul is
deﬁned as a ﬂight between 3 and 6 h. A long haul ﬂight is a journey typically made
by wide-body aircraft that involve long distances, typically beyond six and a half
hours in length, and often are non-stop ﬂights.
Short Haul
Typical short haul airliners in the 1960s and 1970s are Aerospatiale Caravelle,
Ae´rospatiale Corvette, Hawker Siddeley Trident 1C/1E, BAC One-Eleven,

Concerning 1980s and 1990s short hauls, they are Airbus A320, Boeing 737-300,
Boeing 737-400, Boeing 737-500, BAe 146, Fokker 70, Fokker 100, and Yakovlev
Yak-42 (Fig. 1.22). Finally for 2005 and onward, they are Embraer E-190, Embraer
E-195, and Bombardier Aerospace C-Series. All aircrafts are powered by turbofan
engines.
Medium Haul
Medium haul aircrafts are more common class of airliners (normally narrow-body
or single aisle aircraft). These airliners are generally used with fewer passengers
than their wide-body counterparts. Examples include the Boeing 727, 757, MD-80/
MD-90 series, Airbus A320 family, Tupolev Tu-204, Tu-214, Embraer E-Jets 190&
195, and Tu-334. Older airliners like the Boeing 707, 727, McDonnell Douglas
DC-8, Fokker F70/F100, VC10, Tupolev, and Yakovlev jets also ﬁt into this
category. All these airplanes are powered by turbofan engines. Figure 1.24 illus-

collision with a ﬂock of birds, both engines were disabled several minutes after
takeoff. Pilot made a successful landing in Hudson River, saving the lives of all
150 passengers and ﬁve crew.

Long Haul
Long haul aircrafts are the largest airliners, which are wide-body jets and many
passengers. These aircraft are frequently twin-aisle aircraft. Aircraft in this category
are the Boeing 747, Boeing 767, Boeing 777, Boeing 787, Airbus A300/A310,
Airbus A330, Airbus A340, Airbus A380, Airbus A350, Lockheed L-1011 TriStar,
McDonnell Douglas DC-10, McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (Fig. 1.25), Tupolev
Tu-214, Ilyushin Il-86, and Ilyushin Il-96. All aircrafts are powered by turbofan
engines.
It is worth mentioning here that several aircrafts are manufactured in two
versions, one as a transport and the second as a cargo. Moreover, many transports
may be easily converted into cargo aircrafts. However, a few types are designed as a
cargo type from cold start.
1.2.4.3
Military Aircrafts
Military aircrafts are either ﬁxed wing or helicopters (Fig. 1.26). Both can be further
subdivided into combat and non-combat aircrafts.

Combat Fixed Wing Military Aircrafts
Fixed wing combat aircrafts may be classiﬁed into seven categories, namely,
ﬁghter, bomber, ﬁghter-bomber, maritime patrol, ground attack, and powered lift
as illustrated in Fig. 1.27.
Bomber
A bomber is designed to attack ground and sea targets, primarily by dropping
bombs on them [10]. It is worthy mentioning that the ﬁrst non-stop transatlantic

ﬂight in 1919 was made by two British aviators on their heavy twin engine Vickers
Vimy Bomber in 16 h trip.
Bomber aircrafts are further divided into tactics and strategic types.
Strategic bombers are primarily designed for long-range strike missions into the
enemy’s heartland to destroy strategic targets such as supply bases, bridges,
factories, shipyards, and cities. Examples include the: Avro Lancaster, Heinkel
He-111, Junkers Ju 88, B-17 Flying Fortress, B-24 Liberator, B-29 Superfortress,
B-36 Peacemaker, B-47 Stratojet, B-52 Stratofortress, General Dynamics F-111,
Tupolev Tu-16 ‘Badger’, Tupolev Tu-160 ‘Blackjack’, and Tupolev Tu-95 ‘Bear’.
Most – if not all – recent strategic bombers are stealth, while older ones are not.

Tactical bombers are smaller aircraft that operate in shorter range in the battle
zone to attack troops, tanks, and military equipments. Examples for old ones are
Junkers Ju 87 Stuka and Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik, where both are powered by
piston engines. More recent ones are A-10 Thunderbolt II, F-16 Fighting Falcon,
Panavia Tornado, Lockheed F-117, Mikoyan MiG-29, and Sukhoi Su-25
‘Frogfoot’, where all are powered by turbofan engines. Some strategic bombers
are also stealth like B-2.
Fighter
A ﬁghter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat with
other aircraft. Fighters are small, fast, and maneuverable. The term “ﬁghter” is also
sometimes used colloquially for dedicated ground-attack aircraft [11]. Early
ﬁghters were very small and lightly armed by later standards and were mostly
biplanes. By World War II, ﬁghters were predominantly all-metal monoplanes with
wing-mounted batteries of cannons or machine guns.
Grumman F7F-3 Tigercat and Lavochkin La-9 were some of the last
Grumman piston engine ﬁghters. By the end of the war, turbojet engines
were already beginning to replace piston engines as the means of propulsion,
and
increasingly
sophisticated
reﬁnements
to
armament
were
already
appearing. Modern jet ﬁghters are predominantly powered by one or two
turbofan engines and are equipped with radar as the primary method of target
acquisition. Armament consists primarily of air-to-air missiles (from as few as
two on some lightweight day ﬁghters to as many as eight or twelve on air
superiority ﬁghters like the Sukhoi Su-27 or Boeing F-15 Eagle; Fig. 1.29),
with a cannon as backup armament (typically between 20 and 30 mm);
however, they can also often employ air-to-surface missiles, as well as guided
and unguided bombs.
In brief, any ﬁghter aircraft belongs to one of six groups. First generation
group subsonic jet ﬁghters from mid-1940s to mid-1950s, second generation
include jet ﬁghters from mid-1950s to early 1960s, third-generation jet ﬁghters
resembles the period from early 1960s to circa 1970, fourth generation outline jet
ﬁghters of circa 1970 to mid-1990s, 4.5th generation jet ﬁghters available from
1990s to 2005, and lastly, the ﬁfth generation includes jet ﬁghters from 2005 up to
present.
Fighter-Bomber
Many ﬁghters have secondary ground-attack capabilities, and some are dual-role as
ﬁghter-bombers. A strike ﬁghter is an American designation for a ﬁghter-bomber,
examples are Su-7, Su-24, Su-34, F-111, and F-15 Eagle, [12]. A multi-role capable
combat aircraft set up to operate primarily in the tactical bombing role. All are
powered by afterburning turbofan engines.

23

Ground-Attack
Ground-attack aircraft is also identiﬁed as attack aircraft, ﬁghter-bomber, tactical
ﬁghter, tank-buster, tactical bomber, strafer, and strike aircraft. It is designed to
attack targets on the ground and is often deployed as close air support. Examples
include the American A-10 Thunderbolt II (powered by turbofan engine) and the
Russian Sukhoi Su-25 Frogfoot (powered by turbojet engine). Their role is tactical
rather than strategic.
Maritime Patrol
A maritime patrol aircraft, also simply patrol aircraft, or by the older term patrol
bomber, is a ﬁxed-wing aircraft designed to operate for long durations over water in
Fig. 1.29 Fighter aircrafts: Sukhoi Su-27 and Boeing F-15 Eagle
24

Classiﬁcations of Aircrafts and Propulsion Systems

maritime patrol, anti-shipping, anti-submarine (ASW), and search and rescue roles.
Examples for this group during Cold War and Modern eras are Beriev Be-12
(Russia), Ilyushin Il-38 (Russia), Boeing P-8 Poseidon (USA), Lockheed P-2
Neptune (USA), Atlantique ATL3 – Maritime (France), CASA CN-235, C-295
Persuader (Spain), Canadair CP-107 Argus (Canada), Fokker F-27 Maritime (Neth-
erlands), Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod (UK), and PZL M28B Bryza 1R (Poland).
Some of these aircrafts are powered by turbofan engines, while others are powered
by turboprop engines as seen in Fig. 1.30.
Enhanced Takeoff and Landing (TOL)
Enhanced Takeoff and Landing (TOL) types refer to aircrafts that can take off and
land vertically and function differently from a rotorcraft in horizontal ﬂight. It is
subdivided into four main categories; VTOL, STOL, V/STOL, and STOVL. They
stand for vertical takeoff and landing, short takeoff and landing, short and/or
vertical takeoff, and lastly short takeoff and vertical landing, respectively. A list
of all VTOL aircraft is listed in [13]. The two famous examples for vectored thrust
aircrafts are F 35 (Fig. 1.10) and Harrier II (Fig. 1.31) aircrafts.
F-35 is powered by a single F135 turbofan engine with a lift fan, roll posts, and
rear vectoring nozzle.
Harrier aircrafts has four famous versions and powered by turbofan engines with
four swiveling nozzles.
There were also some experimental/prototypes for VTOL aircraft which are
tailless. Examples include the Ryan X-13A-RY Vertijet, Ryan Model 69, Lockheed
XFV, and Convair XFY Pogo. Ryan X-13A-RY Vertijet powered by a single RR
Avon Turbojet engine (1950s), Lockheed XFV (tailsitter prototype), and Convair
XFY Pogo tailsitter powered by a 5500 hp Allison YT40-A-16 turboprop engine.

gliders, ﬁreﬁghting, and surveillance. Moreover, surveillance aircrafts may be
further subdivided into three subgroups: reconnaissance, UAV, and AWACS.
Transport
Military transport aircraft are typically ﬁxed wing cargo aircraft, which are used to
deliver troops, weapons, and other military equipment by a variety of methods to
any area of military operations outside of the commercial ﬂight routes in
uncontrolled airspace. Some military transport aircraft are tasked to perform
multi-role duties such as aerial refueling and tactical, operational and strategic
airlifts onto unprepared runways, or those constructed by engineers. Examples for
these aircrafts are An-24, Il- 112, C-130, and Airbus A400 M, which are powered
by turboprop engines. Others are An -124, Il -76, Galaxy C-5, C-17, C-141B,
Kawasaki C-1, and C-X, which are powered by turbofan engines.
Aerial Refueling
Aerial refueling, also called air refueling, in-ﬂight refueling (IFR), air-to-air
refueling (AAR), or tanking, is the process of transferring fuel from one aircraft
(the tanker) to another (the receiver) during ﬂight. Figure 1.33 illustrates USAD
KC-135R is refueling US Navy F-16. Other refuelers are Airbus A400M, Boeing
C-135, KC-10 Extender, KC-135 Stratotanker, Vickers VC-10, and Il-78. All these

sion from AIRBUS)

aircrafts are powered by turbofan engines, except Airbus A400M which is powered
by turboprop engines.
Trainer
A military trainer is an aircraft used to develop piloting, navigational, or
war-ﬁghting skills in ﬂight crew. Several training phases are followed which starts
usually with turboprop trainers like the Pilatus PC-9 and Embraer Tucano. The ﬁnal
phase includes training for fast jet ﬂying. Examples of such jet trainer aircraft
include the T-38 Talon (actually capable of supersonic speeds), the BAE Hawk, the
Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet, and the Aero L-39. All are powered by turbofan
engines except for T-38, which is powered by afterburning turbojet engine.
Surveillance
A surveillance aircraft are used for monitoring enemy activity, usually carrying no
armament. A surveillance aircraft does not necessarily require high-performance
capability or stealth characteristics. Technically, anything which can ﬂy and make
observations (dynamically or via recording equipment/sensors) of visual informa-
tion or electronic emissions qualiﬁes as a surveillance aircraft. Surveillance aircraft
are either reconnaissance, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or Airborne Warning
and Control System (AWACS).
Airborne Reconnaissance
An airborne reconnaissance goes back to the early era of ballooning. The ﬁrst
reconnaissance ﬂights took place during the Balkan wars in October 1912 by
(Albatros) aircraft. One of the ﬁrst aircrafts used for surveillance was the Rumpler
Taube during World War I. Japanese built Mitsubishi Ki-46 twin-engine reconnais-
sance aircraft in 1939. Fighters such as the British Spitﬁre, Mosquito, the American
P-38 Lightning, and P-51 Mustang were adapted for photo-reconnaissance during
World War II. After World War II, long range aerial reconnaissance was taken up
by adapted bombers like the English Electric Canberra and the American Martin
B-57. The ﬁrst purpose-built jet covert surveillance aircraft, namely, the Lockheed
U-2 was constructed secretly for the United States. Modiﬁed versions of the U-2
remain in service in 2007. In the 1960s the SR-71 Blackbird, the fastest manned
jet-propelled aircraft ever built, was constructed as strategic reconnaissance
aircraft.
There are claims that the USA constructed a new, secret, hypersonic surveillance
aircraft – dubbed the Aurora – in the late 1980s, but no conﬁrmation of this has ever
emerged. Another category of surveillance aircraft that has been in vogue since
World War II is the maritime patrol aircraft. These are typically large, slow
machines capable of ﬂying continuously for many hours, with a wide range of
sensors and electronic equipments on board. Such aircraft include the Avro Shack
leton (powered by piston engines), the Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod (powered by
28

turbofan), the Breguet Atlantique, the P-3 Orion and the Tupolev Tu-95 (all
powered by turboprop), and the P-2 Neptune (powered by radial engines). More-
over, ﬁnally, every ﬁghter plane and ground attack plane can be used to perform
surveillance (recent example is F-35 Joint Strike Fighter).
The second group of surveillance aircrafts is unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
UAV
Remotely piloted vehicle (RPV), or unmanned aircraft system (UAS), is an aircraft
that ﬂies without a human crew on board the aircraft. Their largest uses are in
reconnaissance as well as attack missions. UAV is deﬁned as a reusable, uncrewed
vehicle capable of controlled, sustained, level ﬂight and powered by a jet or
reciprocating engine. There are a wide variety of UAV shapes, sizes, conﬁgura-
tions, and characteristics [14]. UAVs come in two varieties: some are controlled
from a remote location, and others ﬂy autonomously based on pre-programmed
ﬂight plans using more complex dynamic automation systems. Figure 1.34 illus-
trates A MQ-9 Reaper, a hunter-killer surveillance UAV used by the USAF and
British Armed Forces and powered by a 950-shaft-horsepower (712 kW) turboprop
engine.
Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS)
An Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft is designed to carry
out surveillance and C2BM (command and control, battle management) functions.

AWACS aircraft are in service with the USAF, NATO, Russian Air Force, the
RAF, French Air Force, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan Air Force, and the Japan Air Self-
Defense Force.
Modern AWACS systems can detect aircraft from up to 400 km (250 miles)
away. In air-to-air combat, AWACS systems can communicate with friendly
aircraft, extend their sensor range, and give them added stealth, since they no longer
need their own active radar to detect threats.
Examples are Boeing E-3 Sentry (Fig. 1.35; based on the Boeing 707) and
Boeing 767 AWACS. Both are powered by turbofan engines.
Experimental
An experimental aircraft is an aircraft that has not yet been fully proven in ﬂight.
Often this implies that new aerospace technologies are being tested on the aircraft.
The X-planes (X-1 through X-55) are a series of experimental United States aircraft
(and some rockets) [15].
The ﬁrst of these, the Bell X-1, became well-known as the ﬁrst plane to
break the sound barrier, which it did in 1947. Later X-planes yielded
Fig. 1.35 Boeing. E3-D Sentry AWACS aircraft

Classiﬁcations of Aircrafts and Propulsion Systems

important research results, but only the North American X-15 rocket plane of
the early 1960s achieved comparable fame. X-7 through X-12 were actually
missiles, and some other vehicles were unpiloted. Most X-planes are not
expected to ever go into full-scale production except the Lockheed Martin
X-35, which competed against the Boeing X-32 to become the Joint Strike
Fighter.
Glider
Military gliders have been used by the military of various countries for carrying
troops and heavy equipment to a combat zone, mainly during World War II. These
engineless aircraft were towed into the air and most of the way to their target by
military transport planes (e.g. C-47 Skytrain or Dakota) or bombers relegated to
secondary activities (e.g. Short Stirling). Once released from the tow craft near the
front, they were to land on any convenient open terrain close to target. These are
one-way (disposable aircrafts), thus constructed from common and inexpensive
materials such as wood, though a few were retrieved and re-used. Examples are
German Junkers Ju 322, Japanese Ku-13, Soviet Antonov A-40, and American
Waco CG-3.
Fire Fighting
Fire ﬁghting aircraft is an airtankers or water bombers ﬁtted with tanks that can be
ﬁlled on the ground at an air tanker base. Examples are Grumman S-2 T and C-130
(Fig. 1.36). Both are powered by turboprop engines.
1.2.5
Rotorcrafts (Rotor-Wing Aircrafts)
Rotorcraft, or rotary-wing aircraft, uses a spinning rotor with aerofoil section blades
(a rotary wing) to provide lift. Types as depicted in Fig. 1.37 include powered and
unpowered groups.
Unpowered are mainly rotor kites. Powered group includes three main sub-
groups, namely, helicopters, autogyro, and gyrodyne.
1.2.5.1
Powered Rotorcrafts
1.2.5.1.1
Gyrodyne
A gyrodyne is a rotorcraft with a rotor system that is normally driven by its engine
for takeoff and landing – hovering like a helicopter and its forward thrust is
obtained from a separate propulsion device (usually two propellers mounted in
tips of short or stub wings) rather than from tilting the rotor. Being able to ﬂy in
1.2
Classiﬁcations of Aircrafts
31

autorotation gives the gyrodyne all of the advantages and simplicity of a gyroplane.
Figure 1.38 illustrates the famous UK gyrodyne Rotodyne powered by turboprop
engines and having a capacity of 44 passengers and speed of 200 mph.
1.2.5.1.2
Autogyro
An autogyro (sometimes called gyrocopter, gyroplane, or rotaplane) utilizes an
unpowered rotor driven by aerodynamic forces in a state of autorotation to develop
lift, and an engine-powered propeller (mostly piston), similar to that of a ﬁxed-wing
aircraft, to provide thrust (Fig. 1.39).
1.2.5.1.3
Helicopter
Helicopters have powered rotors (single or dual). The rotors are driven (directly or
indirectly) by engine(s) that push air downwards to create lift. Rotors are driven by
the engine(s) throughout the ﬂight, to allow the helicopter to take off vertically,
hover, ﬂy forwards, backwards and laterally, as well as to land vertically. The ﬁrst
“helicopter” ﬂight dates back to 1907. The Frenchman Paul Cornu took off with a
Fig. 1.36 Fireﬁghting C-130 aircraft dropping water

helicopter and hovered at a height of 30 cm for approximately 20 s. Continuous
developments in helicopter industry lead to the extended list of helicopters. Heli-
copters have several different conﬁgurations of one or more main rotors. Each main
rotor has a number of blades between two and six.
Classiﬁcations Based on Rotor
Single Main Rotor
Helicopters with one driven main rotor require some sort of anti-torque device such
as a tail rotor, fantail, or NOTAR, except some rare examples of helicopters using
tip jet propulsion which generates almost no torque. Twin rotor has two rotor discs
which usually rotate in opposite directions, so that no tail rotor or other yaw

stabilizer is needed. The two rotors are arranged in tandem (one in front of the
other), transverse (side by side), coaxial (one rotor disc above the other), with
concentric drive shafts or intermeshing (where the rotor discs may be arranged to
pass through each other).
Tandem Rotor
Tandem rotor helicopters have two large horizontal rotor assemblies mounted one
in front of the other [16]. Tandem rotor helicopters use counter-rotating rotors. This
conﬁguration is used for large cargo helicopters like CH-46 Sea Knight, CH-47
Chinook, Boeing Model 234, and Boeing Model 360.
Transverse Rotors
Transverse rotors are mounted on the end of wings or outriggers, perpendicular to
the body of the aircraft and uses differential collective pitch. This conﬁguration is
found on the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 (powered by radial engine) and Focke-Achgelis
Fa 223 (powered by radial engines), as well as the world’s largest helicopter ever
built, the Mil Mi-12 (powered by turboshaft engines). Figure 1.40 illustrates both
tandem rotor (CH-47 Chinook) and transverse rotor (Focke-Achgelis Fa 223)
helicopters.
Coaxial Rotors
Coaxial rotors (Fig. 1.41) are a pair of helicopter rotors mounted one above the
other on concentric shafts, with the same axis of rotation, but that turn in opposite
directions. This conﬁguration is produced by the Russian Kamov helicopter design
bureau.

Intermeshing Rotors
Intermeshing rotors (sometimes referred to as a synchropter) are a set of two rotors
turning in opposite directions, with each rotor mast mounted on the helicopter with
a slight angle to the other so that the blades intermesh without colliding. The

arrangement allows the helicopter to function without the need for a tail rotor.
Figure 1.42 illustrates HH-43 Huskie helicopter with Intermeshing Rotors.
Early helicopter designs utilized rotary engines, but these were soon replaced by
more powerful automobile engines and radial engines. Next, during the ﬁrst half of
the twentieth century, helicopters used the compact ﬂat engine. Later on, turbine
engines revolutionized helicopter industry, where turboshaft engine gave helicop-
ters an engine with a large amount of power and a low weight penalty.
Civil Helicopters
Helicopters activities are daily increasing both in civilian and military disciplines.
In civil world, helicopters are used in transportation, training, construction, remote
sensing, search and rescue as well as ﬁreﬁghting (Fig. 1.43).
Transport
Helicopters are used as transport vehicles for commercial purposes. It includes
commercial transport, tourism, and aerial photography. Thus it may transport
employees say for oil search companies, isolated locations, or offshore sites.
Moreover, many tourism companies use helicopters for sightseeing like those in
Pyramids’ area in Giza, Egypt, and Las Vegas, USA. Moreover, equipped helicop-
ters are used in aerial photography. It is used also for transporting cargo and

equipments. All helicopters are powered by turboshaft engines, except small types
which are powered by piston engines.
Training
Training helicopters are mostly single engine including MD500E, MD600, Bell
206 JetRanger, and Robinson R22 BetaII. All are powered by turboshaft engines
except for the last one.
Aerial Cranes
Aerial cranes or skycranes are used to lift heavy loads. Figure 1.44 illustrates
Sikorsky Skycrane S-64 (powered by turboshaft engine) carrying a house. Helicop-
ters were ﬁrst used as aerial cranes in the 1950s, but attained its popularity in the
construction ﬁeld in the 1960s.
The most consistent use of helicopters as aerial cranes is in the logging industry
to lift large trees out of rugged terrain. Other lift services to the construction
industry cover: HVAC removal and/or installation, steel tower construction,
powerline construction, marine salvage, remote area operations/high-rise buildings,
and congested areas and erect, remove, and replace all types of antennas and
antenna towers.

Remote Sensing
Helicopters employed in aerial remote sensing for several reasons including: time
ﬂexibility in measurement, high maneuverability, surface sampling, ﬁlls gap
between satellites and ground station, and satellite sensor calibration with helicop-
ter sensors. Typical helicopter for remote sensing are Hughes/MD 500 and BK
117, both are powered by turboshaft engines.
Search and Rescue
Search and rescue helicopters have many duties as sea or coast guard, aerial
ambulance, mining, and energy as well as police departments. Typical helicopters
are Sikorsky series H-19, HH-52A Sea Guard, S-70, HSS-2, and CH-53. All are
powered by turboshaft engines except for Sikorsky H-19, which is powered by
radial engines.
Figure 1.45 illustrates Sikorsky HH-52A Sea Guard, which has the ability to land
on the water.
Agriculture
Agriculture helicopters are used in crop spraying and dusting, seeding and spread-
ing fertilizer, frost patrol, and insect eradication. These helicopters are equipped
with special removable gear for spraying, fertilization, and generation of aerosols.
Examples are Ka-15 M and Mi-1.

Aerial Fireﬁghting
Aerial ﬁreﬁghting is the use of aircraft and other aerial resources to combat
wildﬁres. Aircraft may be ﬁxed-wing or helicopters. Helicopters may be ﬁtted
with tanks or carry buckets. Buckets are usually ﬁlled by submerging in lakes,
rivers, reservoirs, or portable tanks. Popular ﬁreﬁghting helicopters include variants
of the Bell 205 (Fig. 1.46) and the Erickson S-64 Aircrane helitanker, which
features a sea snorkel for ﬁlling while in ﬂight. Both are powered by turboshaft
engines.
Military Helicopters
A military helicopter is a helicopter that is either speciﬁcally built or converted for
use by military forces. A military helicopter’s mission is a function of its design or
conversion. The most common types of military helicopters are transport, attack,
training, experimental, search and rescue, UAV, maritime, tactics and operation,
and ﬁnally observation (Fig. 1.47).
Attack
Attack helicopters are armed helicopters used in the antitank and close air support
roles.

Classiﬁcations of Aircrafts and Propulsion Systems

Weapons used on attack helicopters can include autocannons, machine-guns,
rockets, and guided missiles such as the Hellﬁre. Today’s attack helicopter has two
main roles: ﬁrst, to provide direct and accurate close air support for ground troops,
and the second, in the anti tank role to destroy enemy armor concentrations.
Examples are Mi -24P and Kamov Ka-50, Westland WAH-64 Apache, Boeing
AH-64A Apache, Bell 209/AH-1 HueyCobra, Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Coman-
che, Z-10, Eurocopter Tiger, Augusta A 129 Mangusta, and Denel AH-2 Rooivalk.
All are powered by turboshaft engines (Fig. 1.48).
Trainer
Trainer helicopter is used for air education. An example for this category is
HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter, which is powered by turboshaft engine.
Transport
Transport helicopters are used in places where the use of conventional aircraft
is impossible. It lands easily in any area. Transport helicopters are operated in
assault,
medium,
and
heavy
classes.
Examples
for
this
category
are
Aerospatiale SA 231 Super Frelon, Eurocopter Puma/Cougar, Eurocopter

Experimental
Experimental helicopter as mentioned earlier is an aircraft that has not yet been
fully proven in ﬂight. As an example, X-49A “Speedhawk”, Eurocopter X3,
Kamov Ka-50, Mil Mi-X1, and Sikorsky S-97. All are powered by turboshaft
engines.
Search and Rescue (SAR)
Multi-mission and rescue, or Search and Rescue (SAR) which is sometimes iden-
tiﬁed as Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) are helicopters that perform search and
rescue missions in land and sea. The main objective is to use of available resources
(personnel and facilities) to assist persons, ships, or crafts in potential or actual
distress and provide for their initial medical or other needs, and deliver them to a
place of safety. Examples are CH-118 Iroquois, CH-149 Cormorant, CH-146
Griffon, CH 53GS, HH 60/Pave Hawk, and HH-52A. A sub-group of this category
is Medical evacuation (MEDEVAC). The US military has recently employed UH-
60 Black Hawk helicopters to provide air ambulance service. Also coast-guard
helicopters like HH-65A Dolphin – which used in saving hundreds of lives since
introduction in 1987 – belongs to this sub-category. All are powered by turboshaft
engines.

Maritime Helicopters
Maritime helicopters operate from ships, destroyers, cruisers, and battleships. It
may act as anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-shipping, transport, SAR, and
reconnaissance roles. It must have enhanced protection against salt water cor-
rosion and protection against ingestion of water. Examples are Royal Navy
AgustaWestland EH101 Merlin anti-submarine warfare & medium-lift trans-
port/utility helicopter, LAMPS SH-60B Seahawk, and Kamov Ka-27 (Fig.
1.49).
Tactics and Operations Helicopters
This category of helicopters gives a force multiplier that maximizes their impact in
a combined arms approach. It is employed both as high- and low-intensity warfare.
High-intensity warfare is characterized by large arrays of conventional armed
forces, like Cobra helicopters, which armament included anti-tank missiles, such
as the Nord SS.11, and 3M11 Falanga missiles. Concerning low-intensity warfare,
helicopters are used in counter-insurgency (COIN) warfare. It is powered by
turboshaft engines.

Observation
Observation helicopters were initially limited to visual observation thus featured
rounded, well-glazed cockpits for maximum visibility. Today, they include low
light level television and forward looking infrared cameras. Often, these are
mounted in a stabilized mount along with multi-function lasers capable of
rangeﬁnder and targeting designators for weapons systems.
Examples are Gazelle, OH-58 Kiowa, Kawasaki OH-1, and Tiger ARH. All are
powered by turboshaft engines
UAV
UAV rotorcraft also ﬂies without a human crew on board similar to ﬁxed wing
UAV. They are powered by a jet or reciprocating engine. In addition to conducting
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, it successfully could achieve new
goals. Boeing’s A160T Hummingbird UAV has the ability to resupply frontline
troops in rough terrain (Fig. 1.50). Northrop Grumman Corporation’s RQ-8 Fire
Scout unmanned air vehicle (UAV) can successfully ﬁre two rockets and has the
ability of vertical landings on a moving ship without a pilot controlling the aircraft.
1.2.6
Hybrid Fixed/Rotary Wings
Hybrid ﬁxed/rotary wing aircrafts are a group of aircraft that combines features of
both ﬁxed wing and aircrafts and rotorcrafts. Figure 1.2.38 illustrates that this group

Classiﬁcations of Aircrafts and Propulsion Systems

includes ﬁve sub-groups, namely: tiltrotor, tiltwing, coleopter, mono tiltrotor, and
Mono-tilt-rotor rotary-ring. The ﬁrst two sub-groups are the most famous types
(Fig. 1.51).
1.2.6.1
Tiltrotor
Tiltrotor represents a compound rotorcraft and vectored thrust [17]. Examples for
tiltrotor are Ospery V-22, Bell XV-3, Doak VZ-4, Bell X-22, Ae´rospatiale N
500, Bell XV-15, Bell Eagle Eye, and Bell/Agusta BA609. Figure 1.52 illustrates
V-22 Ospery with US marines jumping from. The Osprey V-22 can be armed with
several types of machine guns pointing rearward that can be ﬁred when the loading
ramp is lowered.
1.2.6.2
Tiltwing
Tiltwing aircraft features a wing that is horizontal for conventional forward ﬂight
and rotates up for vertical takeoff and landing. Tiltwing aircraft are typically fully
capable of VTOL operations. The tiltwing design offers certain advantages in
vertical ﬂight relative to a tiltrotor. Figure 1.53 illustrates Hiller X-18 tiltwing
aircraft.
1.2.6.3
Coleopter
A coleopter is a type of vertical take-off and landing aircraft design where the
fuselage is surrounded by an annular wing. The aircraft is intended to take off and
land on its tail.
SNECMA Cole´opte`re machine may have been the ﬁrst of this type of aircraft to
actually be constructed; the approach itself was ﬁrst put forward in Germany late in
World War II.

SNECMA’s experiences demonstrated formidable control problems, both with
balancing the aircraft during vertical ﬂight, and in transitioning between vertical
and horizontal ﬂight and back. An American design, the Hiller VXT-8, was
abandoned before a prototype was ever built.
1.2.6.4
Mono Tiltrotor
A mono tiltrotor aircraft combines the vertical lift capability and structural efﬁ-
ciency of a helicopter with the speed and range of an airplane [18].

1.2.6.5
Mono-Tilt-Rotor Rotary Wing
A mono-tilt-rotor rotary-ring VTOL aircraft is currently under development. It
differs from previous tiltrotors in that instead of each rotor consisting of long blades
attached to a central rotary ring; it has a single rotary ring which has a diameter
equal to the entire wingspan of the aircraft, with the ring being attached to the tips of
the wings [19].
1.2.7
Other Methods of Lift Aircrafts
It includes the following sub-groups: Flapping Wing, Lifting Body, and FanWing.
1.2.7.1
Flapping Wing or Ornithopter
Flapping wing or ornithopter is an aircraft that ﬂies by ﬂapping its wings
similar to the ﬂight of birds, bats, and insects. Though machines may differ in
form, they are usually built on the same scale as these ﬂying creatures. Suc-
cessful manned ornithopters have been built and ﬂew in 1942 at Munich-Laim
and more recently in 2006 at Canada. German ornithopter was driven by small
ﬂapping wings mounted at the sides of the fuselage, behind a larger ﬁxed wing.
Fitted with a 3 hp Sachs motorcycle engine, it made ﬂights up to 15 min in
duration. Canadian UTIAS Ornithopter No.1 designed by Professor James
DeLaurier and his team made a jet-assisted takeoff and 14-second ﬂight
(Fig. 1.54).

1.2.7.2
Lifting Body
A lifting body is an aircraft conﬁguration in which the body itself produces lift. A
lifting body is a fuselage that generates lift without the shape of a typical thin and
ﬂat wing structure. Lifting bodies generally minimize the drag and structure of a
wing for very high supersonic or hypersonic ﬂight or spacecraft re-entry. In the
period 1963 to 1975, Dryden Flight Research Center built the following lifting
body vehicles M2-F1, M2-F2, M2-F3, HL-10, X-24A, and X-24B. The X-24
(Fig. 1.55) was one of a group of lifting bodies ﬂown by the NASA to demon-
strate the ability of pilots to maneuver and safely land wingless vehicles designed
to ﬂy back to Earth from space and be landed like an airplane at a predetermined
site.
1.2.7.3
FanWing
FanWing or fan wing is a concept for a type of aircraft. It uses a ﬁxed wing with
a forced airﬂow produced by cylindrical fans mounted above the wing. Its
makers claim it is the ﬁrst horizontal-rotored integral lift and propulsion wing
in history to sustain ﬂight. A prototype was tested in 2007. It was airborne after a
ground roll of just 1 m and had a ﬂight speed of 29 km/h and endurance of
80 min. Its maximum take-off weight was 12 kg and powered by a 1.2 kW
electric motor.

Let us proceed,
1. The ﬁrst vehicle is STOVL, which stands for a short takeoff and vertical landing.

powered by an afterburning turbofan engine. An example for this aircraft is F35
aircraft.
2. Agricultural aircraft is also an aerodyne, ﬁxed wing, civilian aircraft. It is

5. Tiltwing an aerodyne, hybrid ﬁxed/rotary wing vehicle, research non-combat
military aircraft. It is powered by a jet engine. Example is Hiller X-18 aircraft
powered by single turbojet and two turboprop engines.
6. Long haul transport is an aerodyne, ﬁxed wing, civilian transport aircraft. It is
powered by a high bypass turbofan engine. Examples are Boeing 747, 777, and
Airbus A380 aircrafts.
7. Balloon is an aerostat unpowered vehicle. No aero engines are needed for its
propulsion/motion. First balloon was ﬂown by Montgolﬁer Brothers on October
1783. The highest altitude achieved by a balloon was 21,067 m by Chinese
Vijaypat Singhania on November 26, 2005.

1.3
Classiﬁcations of Propulsion Systems
An aircraft engine (or aero engine) is a propulsion system for an aircraft. Aircraft
engines are the key module or the heart in aviation progress. Since the early days of
successful ﬂight, the developments of both aero engines and aircraft structure are
concurrent. Aero engines must be:
•
Reliable, as losing power in an airplane, is a substantially greater problem than
in road vehicles
•
Operate at extreme temperature, pressure, and speed
•
Light weight as a heavy engine increases the empty weight of the aircraft and
reduces its payload
•
Powerful, to overcome the weight and drag of the aircraft
•
Small and easily streamlined to minimize the created drag
•
Field repairable to keep the cost of replacement down. Minor repairs should be
relatively inexpensive and possible outside of specialized shops
•
Fuel efﬁcient to give the aircraft the range and maneuverability the design
requires
•
Capable of operating at sufﬁcient altitude for the aircraft
•
Generate the least noise
•
Generates the least emission
Aero engines may be classiﬁed based on input power into three main categories,
namely, internal combustion engines, external combustion engines, and other
power sources (Fig. 1.56).
1.3.1
External Combustion
External combustion engines are steam, stirling, or nuclear engines. In these types,
all heat transfer takes place through the engine wall. This is in contrast to an internal
combustion engine where the heat input is by combustion of a fuel within the body
of the working ﬂuid. Detailed description of the three types will be given hereafter.
1.3.1.1
Steam Engines
Steam aircraft are aircraft that are propelled by steam engines. They were unusual
devices because of the difﬁculty in producing a power plant with a high enough
power to weight ratio to be practical.
In 1899, Gustave Whitehead built and ﬂew a steam powered airplane in Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania, and later on in Hartford, Connecticut. However, this ﬂight has
never been veriﬁed satisfactorily; there are no photographs, news, stories, or other
media from 1899 to conﬁrm it.

In 1902, Louis Gagnon ﬂew a steam helicopter in Rossland, British Columbia,
called the “Flying Steam Shovel”. Control problems caused a crash.
On 12 April 1933, a Travel Air 2000 biplane made the world’s ﬁrst piloted ﬂight
under steam power over Oakland, California. Brothers Besler (George and Wil-
liam) ﬂew a prototype steam powered biplane, based on a Travel Air 2000, several
times (taking off, circling about, and landing, to show the ease of control) at
Oakland airport. Airplane remained aloft for 5 min at each time. It was powered
by a two-cylinder, double-acting reciprocating, 90 V engine, 150 hp (110 kW)
weighing about 500 lbs.

Steam is generated from water by burning cheap crude oil. Sealed condensers
return the steam from the cylinders to the boiler with only 1 % loss. Constant
pressure in the boilers is maintained by electric gauges, which automatically ignite
the burners when pressure begins to fall. Take-off pressure can be generated in
1 min. It was capable of STOL operation due to the ease of reversing thrust.
The strangest feature of the ﬂight was its relative silence. The advantages of this
engine were the elimination of audible noise and destructive vibration; greater
efﬁciency at low engine speeds and also at high altitudes where lower air temper-
atures assisted condensation; reduced likelihood of engine failure; reduced main-
tenance and fuel costs. However, steam reciprocating engine turned out to be
unsuitable for scaling up to the needs of large aircraft. Thus at present days no
single aircraft is powered by steam engine.
1.3.1.2
Stirling Engines
A stirling engine is a heat engine having either air or other gas as a working ﬂuid. It
operates by cyclic compression and expansion of the working ﬂuid, at different
temperature levels such that there is a net conversion of heat energy to mechanical
work. Stirling engines have many advantages like high power density and low cost,
quieter, less polluting, gain efﬁciency with altitude due to lower ambient temper-
atures; more reliable due to fewer parts and the absence of an ignition system,
produce much less vibration (airframes last longer), and safer, less explosive fuels
may be used. However, they have low power density compared to the commonly
used piston engines and gas turbine. This issue made them critical for use as aircraft
engines.
1.3.1.3
Nuclear Engines
A nuclear aircraft is an aircraft powered by nuclear energy. Research into them was
pursued during the Cold War by the United States and the Soviet Union as they
would presumably allow a country to keep nuclear bombers in the air for extremely
long periods of time, a useful tactic for nuclear deterrence. Neither country created
any nuclear aircraft in production numbers. One design problem, never adequately
solved, was the need for heavy shielding to protect the crew from radiation
sickness. Also, in consideration, was the ecological impact of a crash during
operations. Should one of these aircrafts were to crash in a populated area, the
radiation fallout could have been disastrous.
1.3.1.3.1
U.S. Programs
In May 1946, the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project
was started by the United States Air Force. Studies under this program were
1.3
Classiﬁcations of Propulsion Systems
53

done until May 1951, when NEPA was replaced by the Aircraft Nuclear Pro-
pulsion (ANP) program. The ANP program included provisions for studying two
different types of nuclear-powered jet engines, General Electric’s Direct Air
Cycle and Pratt & Whitney’s Indirect Air Cycle. ANP also contained plans for
two B-36 s to be modiﬁed by Convair under the MX-1589 project; one of the
B-36 s was to be used to study shielding requirements for an airborne reactor
while the other was to be the X-6. However, the program was cancelled before
the X-6 was built.
The Oak Ridge National Laboratory conducted research (Aircraft Reactor
Experiment) to produce a nuclear powered aircraft. GE produced the X-39 engine,
which was a modiﬁed version of its J47s turbojet engine. The USA designed these
engines to be used in a new specially designed nuclear bomber, the X-6. The X-6
was eventually terminated by Eisenhower.
The General Electric program in Evendale, Ohio, relied upon direct air cycle
program because of its advantages in simplicity, reliability, suitability, and quick
start ability. Conventional jet engine compressor and turbine sections were used,
with the compressed air run through the reactor itself to heat it before being
exhausted through the turbine.
The Indirect Air Cycle program was assigned to Pratt & Whitney, at a facility
near Middletown, Connecticut. This concept would have produced far less radio-
active pollution. One or two loops of liquid metal would carry the heat from the
reactor to the engine. The Indirect Cycle program never approached anywhere near
producing ﬂight-ready hardware.
On September 5, 1951, the USAF awarded Consolidated-Vultee a contract to ﬂy
a nuclear reactor onboard a modiﬁed Convair B-36 under the MX-1589 project of
the ANP program. The NB-36H Nuclear Test Aircraft (NTA) was to study
shielding requirements for an airborne reactor, to determine whether a nuclear
aircraft was feasible. This was the only known airborne reactor experiment by the
U.S. with an operational nuclear reactor on board. The NTA ﬂew a total of 47 times
testing the reactor over West Texas and Southern New Mexico. The reactor, named
the Aircraft Shield Test Reactor (ASTR), was operational but did not power the
plane, rather the primary purpose of the ﬂight program was shield testing. Based on
the results of the NTA, the X-6 and the entire nuclear aircraft program were
abandoned in 1961.
1.3.1.3.2
Soviet Programs
The Soviet program of developing nuclear aircraft resulted in the experimental
Tupolev 119 (Tu-95 LAL), which was based on a Tupolev Tu-95M bomber. It had
2 conventional turboprop engines and 2 experimental ‘inboard’ direct cycle jet
engines powered by a minimally shielded nuclear reactor in the main fuselage. The
Tu-119 completed 34 research ﬂights. Most of these were made with the reactor
shut down. The main purpose of the ﬂight phase was examining the effectiveness of
the radiation shielding which was one of the main concerns for the engineers.
54

Classiﬁcations of Aircrafts and Propulsion Systems

Massive amounts of protection used resulted in radiation levels low enough to
consider continuing development. But, as in the US, development never continued
past this point. Budgetary constraints and the development of new conventional
aircrafts designs were cited as the main reason for the cancellation of the program in
August 1966. Several other projects reached only design phase.
1.3.1.4
Final Comment
As described above, the three external combustion engines are not appropriate for
employment in aviation ﬁeld for different reasons. Steam engines are only appro-
priate for small aircrafts while large ones need heavy boilers, piping and other
accessories. Stirling engines generate also low power which is also improper for
present aircrafts. Nuclear engines have two drawbacks regarding shielding of ﬂight
crew and passengers versus radiation, as well as the risk of crash in residence areas
leading to catastrophic situation.
1.3.2
Internal Combustion
Internal combustion engines have two broad categories; namely, shaft and reaction
engines. Shaft engines are either of the intermittent or continuous types. Moreover,
intermittent combustion engines may be either of the reciprocating or the Wankel
(rotary design) types. Continuous combustion engines, which may also be identiﬁed
as turbine shaft engines, are next categorized as turboprop, turboshaft and propfan
engines. The other main group of internal combustion is the reaction engines. This
engine group is either of the athodyd (where athodyd stands for Aero THermODY-
namic Duct) or turbine types. Athodyd group includes ramjet, pulsejet and scramjet
engines, while turbine engines includes turbojet, turbofan, turbo ramjet, turbo
rocket and advanced ducted fan engines.
1.3.2.1
Shaft Engines
Shaft engines as previously deﬁned are classiﬁed, based on type of combustion, into
two subgroups; namely, intermittent combustion and continuous combustion.
1.3.2.1.1
Intermittent Combustion
Intermittent combustion engines are either Wankel or reciprocating engines.

Wankel Engine
The Wankel engine invented by German engineer Felix Wankel in 1950, is a type of
internal combustion engine which uses a rotary design to convert pressure into a
rotating motion. Figure 1.57 illustrates Diamond DA20 aircraft powered by Wankel
engine. Its four-stroke cycle takes place in a space between the inside of an oval-
like epitrochoid-shaped housing and a rotor that is similar in shape to a Reuleaux
triangle but with sides that are somewhat ﬂatter [20]. This design delivers smooth
high-rpm power from a compact size. The ﬁrst Wankel rotary-engine aircraft was
the experimental Lockheed Q-Star in 1968/1969. It was powered by a 185 hp
Curtiss-Wright RC2-60 Wankel rotary engine. The compact size and quiet opera-
tion of Wankel engine encouraged its usage in UAVs. Wankel engines are also
becoming increasingly popular in homebuilt experimental aircraft being very cheap
compared with certiﬁed aircraft engines, providing engines ranging from 100 to
300 horsepower (220 kW) at a fraction of the cost of traditional engines. Wankel
engines operate at a relatively high rotational speed with relatively low torque, thus,
propeller aircraft must use a Propeller Speed Reduction Unit (PSRU) to keep
conventional propellers within the proper speed range.
Piston Engine
A Piston engine, also often known as a reciprocating engine, is a heat engine that
uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert pressure into a rotating motion. It
Fig. 1.57 Wankel engine

Classiﬁcations of Aircrafts and Propulsion Systems

is well known that piston engine powered the ﬁrst ever piloted motorized ﬂight
made by Orville and Wilbur Wright on 17th December 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North
Carolina, USA. Since then, continuous developments were enhanced. Piston
engines may be classiﬁed into ﬁve groups as shown in Fig. 1.58. These are
in-line, rotary, V-type, radial, and opposed. These engines are coupled to a propel-
ler to furnish the forward ﬂight of airplanes.
In-Line
An in-line engine has cylinders lined up in one row. It typically has an even number
of cylinders, but there are instances of three- and ﬁve- cylinder engines. Inline
engines were common in early aircraft, including the Wright Flyer (12 horsepower),
the aircraft that made the ﬁrst controlled powered ﬂight. An in-line engine may be
air cooled but mostly liquid cooled.
The biggest advantage of an inline engine is that it allows the aircraft to be
designed with a narrow frontal area for low drag. If the engine crankshaft is located
above the cylinders, it is called an inverted inline engine, which allows the propeller
to be mounted up high for ground clearance even with short landing gear. The
disadvantages of an inline engine include a poor power-to-weight ratio, because the
crankcase and crankshaft are long and thus heavy. Thus inline design was aban-
doned, becoming a rarity in modern aviation.
Rotary Engine
Rotary engine was extensively used in World War I as it is lightweight, powerful,
cheap, and easy to manufacture in large quantities. Rotary engines have all the
cylinders in a circle around the crankcase like a radial engine, but the difference is
that the crankshaft is bolted to the airframe, and the propeller is bolted to the engine
case. The entire engine rotates with the propeller, providing plenty of airﬂow for
cooling regardless of the aircraft’s forward speed. Some of these engines were a
two-stroke design, giving them a high speciﬁc power and power-to-weight ratio.
Unfortunately, the severe gyroscopic effects from the heavy rotating engine made
the aircraft very difﬁcult to ﬂy. The engines also consumed large amounts of castor
oil, spreading it all over the airframe and creating fumes which were nauseating to
the pilots.

Radial Engine
Radial engine has one or more rows of cylinders arranged in a circle around a
centrally located crankcase. Each row must have an odd number of cylinders in
order to produce smooth operation. A radial engine has only one crank throw per
row and a relatively small crankcase, resulting in a favorable power to weight ratio.
Because the cylinder arrangement exposes a large amount of the engine’s heat
radiating surfaces to the air and tends to cancel reciprocating forces, radials tend to
cool evenly and run smoothly. Wasp engine, completed in the Christmas eve of
1925, was a radial piston engine with a 1340 cubic inches displacement and
manufactured by Pratt & Whitney company (P&W). Wasp engines dominated
Navy and Army Air Force ﬁghter planes as well as commercial transports. It
powered approximately 100 different experimental and production airplanes
including Boeing 40A, Boeing F2B-1 shipboard ﬁghters, and Ford Tri-Motor. By
the early 1930s, P&W worked on twin-row radial engines. Its twin Wasp (1830
cubic inches and 1350 horsepower) performed magniﬁcently. A total of 173,618
engines were produced that powered a large number of ﬁghters, bombers (which
participated later in WWII), and transports. The twin Wasp was followed by Double
Wasp, which is an 18-cylinder twin-row radial with 2800 cubic inches of displace-
ment. P&W engines from the wasp to the Double Wasp produced, licensed, and
afﬁliated over 363,000 engines. Wasp major was the last P&W piston engine. It was
28-cylinder, 4360 cubic inch displacement and rated power up to 4300 horsepower.
The cylinders were four in rows, arranged for a spiral for better cooling. Its primary
application was in heavy transport and bombers. Examples are Boeing’s giant
double-decked Strato-cruiser, the 377 and Air Force B-50; both were powered by
four Wasp Majors.
BMW 801 was the ﬁrst German double-row radial engine manufactured in 1940/
1941. Figure 1.59 illustrates both rotary and radial piston engines.

V-Type
Cylinders in V-type engine are arranged in two in-line banks, tilted 30-60 apart
from each other. The vast majority of V engines are water-cooled. Perhaps the most
famous example of this design is the legendary Rolls Royce Merlin engine, a 27-l
(1649 in3) 60 V12 engine used in, among others, the Spitﬁres that played a major
role in the Battle of Britain (Fig. 1.60).
Opposed-Type
An opposed-type engine has two banks of cylinders on opposite sides of a centrally
located crankcase; ULPower UL260i as an example. The engine is either air cooled
or liquid cooled, but air cooled versions predominate. Opposed engines are
mounted with the crankshaft horizontal in airplanes, but may be mounted with
the crankshaft vertical in helicopters. Due to the cylinder layout, reciprocating
forces tend to cancel, resulting in a smooth running engine. Opposed, air-cooled
four and six cylinder piston engines are by far the most common engines used in
small general aviation aircraft requiring up to 400 horsepower (300 kW) per engine.
Aircraft which require more than 400 horsepower (300 kW) per engine tend to be
powered by turbine engines.
1.3.2.1.2
Continuous Combustion Engines
Continuous combustion engines are mainly turbine shaft engines. It includes
turboprop turboshaft and propfan engines. They are featured with rotating elements

known as turbomachines, as sub-modules. These modules may be fan, compressor(s),
and turbine(s) as well as propellers/propfans.
Turboprop
Turboprop engines powers both civil and military transport aircrafts with a cruise
speed less 450 mph (700 km). It is composed of a gas generator (compressor,
combustion chamber and turbine) as well as a propeller. The turbine drives both
compressor and propeller. Because gas turbines optimally spin at high speed, a
turboprop features a gearbox to lower the speed of the shaft so that the propeller tips
do not reach supersonic speeds. An alternative to the above turboprop engines, a
second turbine is added which drives only the propeller either directly or via a
gearbox. The ﬁrst turbine in this case drives the compressor only. Thus it is free to
rotate at its own best speed (referred to as a free- or power-turbine). The other
turbine is identiﬁed as compressor-turbine. Recent turboprop engines generate
thrust force from both propeller and exhaust jet stream. A fraction of 10–20 % of
thrust is generated from jet stream. Consequently, some people classify turboprop
as jet engine or reaction engine. Figure 1.61 illustrates two turboprop engines, the
left is a single-shafted one with propeller coupled to compressor-turbine shaft and
the right one is of the free turbine type.
Examples for turboprop engines are Rolls-Royce T56 (3460 shaft horsepower
installed to P-3 Orion, C-130, C-2A aircrafts), Rolls-Royce AE2100 engine
(3600–6000 shp installed to C-27 J Spartan, ShinMaywa US-1A Kai aircrafts),
and Rolls-Royce TP400-D6 engine (11,000 + shp installed to Airbus Military
A400M aircraft). The T34 is one of the earliest turboprop engines manufactured
by Pratt & Whitney, which powered B-17 ﬂying testbed, KC-97 J, and Douglas
C-133A Cargomaster. PT6 turboprop engine (Pratt & Whitney of Canada) is the
most popular power plant in its class (475–1650 hp). It has been selected for more
than 130 different business, commuter, trainer, and utility aircraft applications.
Example for GE turboprop engines is CT7, which power Saab 340 and CASA-
IPTN CN235.

Turboshaft
Turboshaft engines are used primarily for helicopters and auxiliary power units. A
turboshaft engine is very similar to a turboprop, with a key difference: In a
turboprop the propeller is supported by the engine, and the engine is bolted to the
airframe. In a turboshaft, the engine does not provide any direct physical support to
the helicopter’s rotors. The rotor is connected to a transmission, which itself is
bolted to the airframe, and the turboshaft engine simply feeds the transmission via a
rotating shaft. The distinction is seen by some as a slim one, as in some cases
aircraft companies make both turboprop and turboshaft engines based on the same
design. An example for turboshaft engine is GE T700, which powers Seahawk
helicopter (Fig. 1.62).
Other examples for turboshaft engines are Rolls-Royce RTM322 (2100–2550
shp, which powers AgustaWestland WAH-64 Apache), Rolls-Royce Gnome
(1175–1660 shp, which powers AgustaWestland Sea King and Kawasaki/Boeing
Vertol 107), and T800 (1360–1680 shp, which powers AgustaWestland Super Lynx
300/3 CTS800) manufactured by LHTEC, a joint venture between Rolls-Royce and
Honeywell. GE T700 is one of the historical turboshaft engines that powers the
Marine Corps “SuperCobra” built by Bell, military Sikorsky H-60 and international
versions of the Sikorsky S-70. The commercial version of T700, namely, CT7,
powers Bell 214ST, Sikorsky S-70C, and Westland WS-70.
Propfan
A propfan or an unducted fan (sometimes denoted in former Soviet Union as
turbopropfan) is a modiﬁed turbofan engine, with the fan placed outside of the
engine nacelle on the same axis as the compressor blades. Propfans are also known
as ultra-high bypass (UHB) engines and, most recently, open rotor jet engines. The
design is intended to offer the speed and performance of a turbofan, with the fuel
economy of a turboprop.
The propfan concept was developed to deliver better fuel efﬁciency than con-
temporary turbofans. However, this achievement has noise penalty. Most propfans

Classiﬁcations of Propulsion Systems
61

are experimental engines. Examples are General Electric’s GE36 Unducted Fan and
Pratt & Whitney/Allison 578-DX. General Electric’s GE36 Unducted Fan
(Fig. 1.63) was a variation on NASA’s original propfan concept and appears similar
to a pusher conﬁguration for piston or turboprop engines.
McDonnell Douglas developed a proof-of-concept aircraft by modifying its
MD-80. They removed the JT8D turbofan engine from the left side of the fuselage
and replaced it with the GE36. The test ﬂights conducted in Mojave, CA, USA, and
ended in 1988 demonstrated a 30 % reduction in fuel burn over turbo-fan powered
MD-80 and low-levels of exterior and interior noise/vibration. However, due to
jet-fuel price drops and shifting marketing priorities, Douglas shelved the program
the following year.
In the 1980s, Allison collaborated with Pratt & Whitney on demonstrating the
578-DX propfan. The 578-DX was successfully ﬂight tested on a McDonnell
Douglas MD-80. However, none of the above projects came to fruition, mainly
because of excessive cabin noise (compared to turbofans) and low fuel prices.
The Ivchenko-Progress D-27 propfan developed in the USSR with the propfan
blades at the front of the engine in a tractor conﬁguration (Fig. 1.64). D-27’s
propfans propelled the Antonov An-70. D-27 propfan engine is a three-shaft
propfan engine with a propeller diameter of 4.5 m and dry weight of 1650 kg
(3638 lb). Its gas generator is made up of an axial low-pressure compressor, a
mixed-ﬂow high-pressure compressor, an annular combustion chamber, a single-
stage high-pressure turbine, and a single-stage low-pressure turbine. The SV-27
contra-rotating propfan is driven by a four-stage turbine via a shaft connected to a
planetary reduction gear.
With the current high price for jet fuel and the emphasis on engine/airframe
efﬁciency to reduce emissions, there is renewed interest in the propfan concept for

jetliners that might come into service beyond the Boeing 787 and Airbus
A350XWB. For instance, Airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-
mounted counter-rotating propfans.
1.3.2.2
Reaction Engines
The other main group of internal combustion engines, namely, the reaction engines
is next subdivided into the athodyd (where athodyd stands for Aero THermODY-
namic Duct) or turbine types. Athodyd group includes ramjet, pulsejet, and scramjet
engines. Turbine engines include engines that have turbomachinery modules, which
combine all types of turbojet, turbofan, turbo ramjet, turbo rocket, and advanced
ducted fan engines. In short, all reaction engines develop its propulsive force as a
reaction to the jet exhaust gases. Three essential modules are seen in all reaction
types, namely, an entry duct (sometimes identiﬁed as inlet duct or intake), a
combustion chamber or burner, and an exhaust nozzle. The exhaust nozzle
(s) accelerate air/gases to greater speeds than ﬂight speed, thus create thrust that
pushes the aircraft forward.

1.3.2.2.1
Athodyd Types
Athodyd group includes ramjet, pulsejet, and scramjet engines, which do not have
any major rotating elements or turbomachinery. The pulsejet operates intermit-
tently and has found limited applications [21]. In ramjet engines, ram compression
of the air becomes sufﬁcient to overcome the need for mechanical compression.
Ramjet engine is also appropriate for supersonic ﬂight speeds [22]. If the ﬂight
speed is so high, fuel combustion must occur supersonically, and then this ramjet is
called a scramjet [23].
Ramjet Engine
A ramjet, sometimes referred to as a stovepipe jet, is a form of jet engine using the
engine’s forward motion to admit and compress incoming air, without a rotary
compressor. Ramjets cannot produce thrust at zero airspeed and thus cannot move
an aircraft from a standstill. It is composed of three modules: inlet duct, burner or
combustor, and nozzle. It has two types: namely liquid- and solid-fuel ramjets.
Ramjet engines may be subsonic or supersonic (Fig. 1.65). Subsonic ramjets do not
need a sophisticated inlet since the airﬂow is already subsonic and a simple hole is
usually used. For supersonic ramjets, supersonic ﬂow is decelerated to subsonic
speeds at the inlet through one or more oblique shock wave(s), terminated by a
strong normal shock.
Thus air attains subsonic speeds at the entrance of combustion chamber. The
combustor adds heat and mass to the compressed air by burning a fuel. The
combustion chamber includes ﬂame holders that stop the ﬂames from blowing
out. A ramjet combustor can safely operate at stoichiometric fuel to air ratios,
which implies a combustor exit stagnation temperature of the order of 2400 K for
kerosene.

least Mach 5.

Historically, ramjet was invented in 1913 by the French inventor Rene´ Lorin,
who was granted a patent for his device illustrated in Fig. 1.65. Attempts to build a
prototype failed due to inadequate materials [24]. However, in 1949, the works of
Rene´ Leduc led to design of Leduc 010, which was one of the ﬁrst ramjet-powered
aircrafts that ﬂew in 1949 and displayed in Fig. 1.66. Later on, the French Nord
1500 Griffon reached Mach 2.19 in 1958.
In 1915, the Hungarian inventor Albert Fono devised a solution for increasing
the range of artillery, comprising a gun-launched projectile by adding a ramjet
propulsion unit. He submitted a German patent describing an “air-jet engine”
suitable for high-altitude supersonic aircraft. In an additional patent application,
he adapted the engine for subsonic speed. The patent was ﬁnally granted in 1932
after 4 years of examination.
In the Soviet Union, a theory of supersonic ramjet engines was presented in 1928
by Boris S. Stechkin. The ﬁrst successful ramjet engine, namely, GIRD-04, was
designed by I.A. Merkulov and tested in April 1933. The GIRD-08 phosphorus-
fueled ramjet was tested by ﬁring it from artillery cannon. These shells may have
been the ﬁrst jet powered projectiles to break the speed of sound. In August 1939,
Merkulov developed the ﬁrst ramjet engine for use as an auxiliary motor of DM-1
aircraft. The world’s ﬁrst ramjet powered airplane ﬂight took place in December
1939, using two DM-2 engines on a modiﬁed Polikarpov I-15. Merkulov designed a
ramjet ﬁghter “Samolet D” in 1941. Two of his DM-4 engines were installed on the
YaK-7PVRD ﬁghter, during World War II. In 1940, the Kostikov-302 experimental
plane was designed, powered by liquid fuel rocket for take-off and ramjet engines
for ﬂight. In 1947, Mstislav Keldysh proposed a long-range antipodal bomber
powered by ramjet instead of rocket.
Pulsejet Engine
A pulse jet engine (or pulsejet) is a very simple type of jet engine in which
combustion occurs in pulses. Pulsejets use an intermittent combustion while ram-
jets employ a continuous combustion process. Pulsejet engines are a unique type of
jet engine, able to operate statically with few [25] or no moving parts [26]. They are
very simple and cheap to construct. They feature an excellent balance of cost and

function, as could run on any grade of petroleum and the ignition shutter system.
Their accompanying noise is unacceptable by modern standards. They have both a
higher efﬁciency and very high thrust-to-weight ratio compared to other jet engines.
Pulsejet engines may be produced in many sizes with different outputs ranging from
a few pounds to thousands of pounds of thrust. There are two main types of pulsejet
engines: valved (Fig. 1.67) and valveless (Fig. 1.68). Both types use resonant
combustion and harness the expanding combustion products to form a pulsating
exhaust jet, which produces thrust intermittently.
Valved
Valved engines use a mechanical one-way valve, which is a simple leaf-spring type
of shutter. With the valve open, a fresh charge of air is admitted. The air mixes with
the fuel and then an explosion takes place, which shuts the valve and forces the hot
gas to go out the back of the engine through the tailpipe only, and allow fresh air
and more fuel to enter through the intake (Fig. 1.67). The superheated exhaust gases
exit through an acoustically resonant exhaust pipe.

Classiﬁcations of Aircrafts and Propulsion Systems

Valveless
Valveless pulsejets have no moving parts and use only their geometry to control the
ﬂow of exhaust out of the engine (Fig. 1.68). Valveless engines expel exhaust out of
both the intakes and the exhaust, most try to have the majority of exhaust go out the
longer tail pipe, for more efﬁcient propulsion. The valveless pulse jet engine
operates on the same principle as valved type. Combustion process creates two
shock wave fronts, one travelling down the upper long pipe (tube) and the other
down the short lower tube. By properly “tuning” of the system, a resonating
combustion process can be achieved, which yields considerable thrust. Fuel con-
sumption is very high and noise level is also unacceptable. The French engine
manufacturer SNECMA developed these pulsejets in late forties for use on drones.
One application was the Dutch AT-21 target drone built by Aviolanda Aircraft from
1954–1958 [27].
Historically, the ﬁrst working pulsejet was patented in 1906 by Russian engineer
V.V. Karavodin, completing a working model in 1907. The French inventor
Georges Marconnet patented his valveless pulsejet engine in 1908. A German
designer and inventor Schmidt designed the V-1 ﬂying bomb in 1933. The original
Schmidt design had the pulsejet placed in a fuselage like a modern jet ﬁghter, unlike
the eventual V-1 which had the engine placed above the warhead and fuselage
(Fig. 1.69). Schmidt working for Argus Company, the pulsejet was modiﬁed and
identiﬁed as the Argus As 109-014. The ﬁrst unpowered drop occurred at
Peenemu¨nde on 28 October 1942 and the ﬁrst powered ﬂight occurred on
10 December 1942. Later on it was used in the bombing of London in 1944. Its
static thrust was 500 lbf (2200 N), while in ﬂight thrust reached approximately
750 lbf (3300 N).

The high noise levels of pulsejets made them impractical for other than military
and other similarly restricted applications. They have been used to power experi-
mental helicopters, the engines being attached to the extreme ends of the rotor
blades. Pulsejets have the distinct advantage over conventional turbine engines of
not producing the usual reaction torque upon the fuselage.
Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE)
The pulse detonation engine (PDE) marks a new approach towards non-continuous
jet engines and promises higher fuel efﬁciency compared even to turbofan jet
engines, at least at very high speeds. Pratt & Whitney and General Electric now
have active PDE research programs. Most PDE research programs use pulsejet
engines for testing ideas early in the design phase.
Scramjet Engine
Scramjet is an evolution of the ramjets that are able to operate at much higher
speeds than ramjets or any other kind of airbreathing engines. It is an acronym for
Supersonic Combustion Ramjet, or in other words combustion of fuel and air occurs
in a supersonic ﬂow relative to engine. Scramjets start working at speeds of at least
Mach 4 and have a theoretical maximum speed of Mach 17.
In the 1950s and 1960s, a variety of experimental scramjets engines were built
and ground tested in USA and the UK. In 1981, tests were made in Australia.
Presently, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, South Korea,
and Sweden have also hypersonic propulsion programs. No scramjet powered
vehicle has yet been produced outside an experimental program. Scramjet engines
ﬁnd its applications in many recent hypersonic speed vehicles like rockets, future

commercial transports in the twenty-ﬁrst century as well as single stage to orbit
(SSTO) launchers.
It provides the most integrated engine–vehicle design for aircraft and missiles.
The engine occupies the entire lower surface of the vehicle body (Fig. 1.70). The
propulsion system consists of ﬁve major engine-components and two vehicle-
components: the internal inlet, isolator, combustor, internal nozzle, and fuel supply
subsystem, and the craft’s forebody, essential for air induction, and aft-body, which
is a critical part of the nozzle component.
Both hydrocarbon and hydrogen are used as fuels for scramjets. Scramjets are
mechanically simple but aerodynamically more complex than a jet engine. It uses
the speed of the aircraft to compress the air, so very few moving parts are needed to
operate it. The minimum functional speed, however, requires acceleration by other
jet engine to hypersonic speed before the scramjet can become active. Boeing or
NASA X-43 is an example for experimental scramjet with a world speed record for
a jet-powered aircraft – Mach 9.7, nearly 12,000 km/h (7000 mph) at an altitude
of about 36,000 m (110,000 ft). The X-43A set the ﬂight speed record on
16 November 2004.
Moreover, Boeing X-51 (also known as X-51 WaveRider) is an unmanned
scramjet demonstration aircraft. It completed its ﬁrst powered hypersonic ﬂight
on 26 May 2010 for over 6 min and reached speeds of over Mach 5 for 210 s on 1st
May 2013 for the longest duration hypersonic ﬂight.

Turbojet
A turbojet is a type of gas turbine engine that was co-invented by Frank Whittle
(in UK) and von Ohain (in Germany) in the thirties. It is the simplest of all aircraft
gas turbines. It features one or more compressors to draw air in and compress it, a
combustion section which adds fuel and ignites it, one or more turbines that extract
power from the expanding exhaust gases to drive the compressor(s) and provide
power to aircraft systems, as well as an exhaust nozzle which accelerates the
exhaust out the back of the engine to create thrust. Each compressor is connected
by a shaft to a turbine.
The compressor is either of the axial or centrifugal type (Fig. 1.71). The ﬁrst
turbojet engines of Frank Whittle and von Ohain were of the centrifugal compressor
type. All the turbines used are of the axial type. Axial compressors and the turbines
are composed of many blade rows: some are rotating called rotor and others are
stationary identiﬁed as stator. When turbojets were introduced, the top speed of
ﬁghter aircraft equipped with them was at least 100 miles per hour faster than
competing piston-driven aircraft.
Many subsequent turbojet engines were designed and manufactured in Europe
by Rolls Royce, like Viber engine which powered MB339 and HAL HJT Kiran.
General Electric (GE) produced America’s ﬁrst jet engine based on Whittle’s
design. It was GE-I-A where two of which powered the ﬁrst United States ﬁrst jet
aircraft, the Bell XP-59A in October 1942. In USA also, Pratt & Whitney designed
and produced its ﬁrst gas turbine engine of its design, namely, J42 Turbo-Wasp
engine, which was delivered to the Navy in November 1948 for installation in the
Grumman F9F-2 Panther. In order for ﬁghter planes to ﬂy faster than sound
(supersonically), an afterburner is added to a core turbojet (Fig. 1.72). When the
afterburner is turned on, additional fuel is injected, which burns and produces
additional thrust. Thus additional thrust is gained but much more fuel is burnt.
When the afterburner is turned off, the engine performs like a basic turbojet.
Afterburners are only used on ﬁghter planes and the supersonic airliner, Concorde.

It was clear that below about Mach 2, turbojets are very fuel inefﬁcient and
create tremendous amounts of noise. These drawbacks eventually led to the down-
fall of the pure turbojet, and only a handful of types are still in production. Thus,
turbojet engines were replaced by turbofan engines. The last airliner that used
turbojets was the Concorde, whose Mach-2 ﬂight crossed the threshold into efﬁ-
cient turbojet operation.
Examples for turbojet engines are General Electric GE J33 (powered the jet
ﬁghter – the Lockheed P-80) and GE J35 (powered the ﬁrst Boeing XB-47, the
Northrop YB-49A ﬂying wing and the Douglas D-558-1). GE J47 turbojet engine
set a record of over 35,000 produced engines that powered various military aircrafts
in the mid 1950s. Moreover, one of the most famous turbojet engines is GE J79,
which enabled some US ﬁghters to reach twice speed of sound. These include the
Convair B-58 “Hustler”, the Lockheed F-104 “Starﬁghter”, and the McDonnell F-4
“Phantom II”. Pratt & Whitney produced many turbojet engines like J48 (which
powered F9F-6 Cougar and Lockheed F-94C Starﬁre) and J57 which is a twin spool
(powered North American F-100 sabre, McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, and Lockheed
U-2 Air Force reconnaissance plane). A commercial version of J57 is the JT3 which
powered Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8. A distinguished turbojet engine was also
P&W J58 that was selected to power the Air Force SR-71 Blackbird surveillance/
reconnaissance aircraft. It may be concluded here that turbojet engine is outdated
now and seldom seen either in military or civil aircrafts.
Turbofan
Most modern airliners, troop, and cargo transports as well as military aircrafts use
turbofan engines because of their high thrust and good fuel efﬁciency. As with other
gas turbines, there is a core engine similar to a turbojet engine, which is surrounded
Fig. 1.72 Subsonic and supersonic turbojet engines
1.3
Classiﬁcations of Propulsion Systems
71

by a fan in the front (or rear for aft turbofan engines) and an additional turbine at the
rear. The fan and fan turbine are composed of many blade rows and are connected to
an additional shaft. As with the core compressor and turbine, some of the fan blades
turn with the shaft and some blades remain stationary. The fan shaft passes through
the core shaft for mechanical reasons. This type of arrangement is called a two spool
engine (one “spool” for the fan, one “spool” for the core). Some advanced engines
have additional spools for even higher efﬁciency. The incoming air is captured by
the engine inlet. Some of the incoming air passes through the fan and continues on
into the core compressor and then the burner, where it is mixed with fuel and
combustion occurs. The hot exhaust passes through the core and fan turbines and
then out the nozzle, as in a basic turbojet. The rest of the incoming air passes
through the fan and bypasses, or goes around the engine, just like the air through a
propeller. The air that goes through the fan has a velocity that is slightly increased
from free stream. So a turbofan gets some of its thrust from the core and some of its
thrust from the fan. The ratio of the air that goes around the engine to the air that
goes through the core is called the bypass ratio. Engines with bypass ratios of 1–2
are generally termed low bypass ratio turbofans. High bypass turbofans found on
most current transport aircraft, where bypass ratio is continuously increasing and
reached 10 or more in some turbofan engines. Figure 1.73 illustrates high and low
bypass ratio turbofan Engines
Because the fuel ﬂow rate for the core is changed only a small amount by the
addition of the fan, a turbofan generates more thrust for nearly the same amount of
fuel used by the core. This means that a turbofan is very fuel efﬁcient. In fact, high
bypass ratio turbofans are nearly as fuel efﬁcient as turboprops. Since the fan is
enclosed by the inlet and is composed of many blades, it can operate efﬁciently at
higher speeds than a simple propeller. That is why turbofans are found on high
speed transports and propellers are used on low speed transports. Low bypass ratio
turbofans are still more fuel efﬁcient than basic turbojets.
Many modern ﬁghter planes actually use low bypass ratio turbofans equipped
with afterburners. They can then cruise efﬁciently but still have high thrust when

dog ﬁghting. Even though the ﬁghter plane can ﬂy much faster than the speed of
sound, the air going into the engine must travel less than the speed of sound for high
efﬁciency. Therefore, the airplane inlet slows the air down from supersonic speeds.
Figure 1.74 illustrates a layout (A) and a schematic diagram (B) for an afterburning
low bypass ratio turbofan engine.
A few examples for turbofan engines are listed in the following table arranged by
manufacturer’s products (Table 1.1).
Example 1.2 Write down the following data (sea level static thrust SLS, maximum
diameter, length, weight, bypass ratio, and application) for the following turbofan
engines: ALF502R-6, CFM56-2-C1, GE90-90B, Trent 1000-A1, V2500-A1,
RB211-524H, Tay 620, Trent 800, JT8D-217, PW2037, PW4098
Solution
The requested data is arranged in Table 1.2.
Figure 1.75 illustrates an aft fan turbofan engine. It is featured an integrated aft
fan/low pressure (LP) turbine unit located in a turbojet exhaust jet pipe. Hot gases
from the turbojet turbine exhaust expand through the LP turbine, the fan blades
being a radial extension of the turbine blades. The difference between aft fan
turbofan engine and propfan or unducted fan (UDF) is that aft fan is a/an ducted/
enclosed turbomachine (or surrounded by a casing), while propfan/UDF conﬁgu-
ration is not surrounded by any casing. One of the problems with the aft fan
conﬁguration is hot gas leakage from the LP turbine to the fan.

engine (Fig. 1.76) combines the turbojet engine for speeds up to Mach 3 with the
ramjet engine, which has good performance at high Mach numbers [28].
The engine is surrounded by a duct that has a variable intake at the front and an
afterburning jet pipe with a variable nozzle at the rear. During takeoff and accel-
eration, the engine functions as a conventional turbojet with the afterburner lit while
at other ﬂight conditions up to Mach 3, the afterburner is inoperative. As the aircraft
accelerates through Mach 3, the turbojet is shut down and the intake air is diverted
from the compressor, by guide vanes, and ducted straight into the afterburning jet
pipe, which becomes a ramjet combustion chamber. This engine is suitable for an

aircraft requiring high speed and sustained high Mach number cruise conditions
where the engine operates in the ram jet mode.
Figure 1.77 shows Pratt & Whitney J58 engines powering the SR-71 aircrafts.
P&W J58 is an example for turbo-ramjet engine [29]. It could be converted during
ﬂight from being largely a turbojet to being largely a compressor-assisted ramjet. At
high speeds (above Mach 2.4), the engine used variable geometry vanes to direct
excess air through six bypass pipes from downstream of the fourth compressor stage
into the afterburner. Thus, 80 % of the SR-71’s thrust at high speed was generated in
this way, giving much higher thrust, improving speciﬁc impulse by 10–15 %, and
permitting continuous operation at Mach 3.2.
Turborocket Engine
The turborocket (or air turborocket) engine (Fig. 1.78) is a type of airbreathing
engine combining elements of a jet engine and a rocket, which is also known by its
acronym as the ATR. The ATR belongs to a general class of propulsion engines
known as Turbine-Based Combined-Cycle, or TBCC, engines. It could be consid-
ered as an alternative engine to the turbo ramjet. However, it has one major
difference in that it carries its own oxygen to provide combustion at high speed
[28]. The engine has a low pressure compressor driven by a multi-stage turbine; the
power to drive the turbine is derived from combustion of kerosene and liquid
oxygen in a rocket-type combustion chamber. Since the gas temperature will be
in the order of 3500 C, additional fuel is sprayed into the combustion chamber for
cooling purposes before the gas enters the turbine. This fuel-rich mixture (gas) is

then diluted with air from the compressor and the surplus fuel burnt in a conven-
tional afterburning system. It is ﬁnally exhausting through a convergent-divergent
propelling nozzle. In some ATRs, the hot gas can be produced by burning of a solid
propellant.
Although the engine is smaller and lighter than the turbo ramjet, it has higher
fuel consumption. This tends to make it more suitable for an interceptor or space-
launcher type of aircraft that requires high speed and high altitude performance and
normally has a ﬂight plan that is entirely accelerative and of short duration.

Advanced Ducted Fan
Advanced ducted fan are essentially turbofans with large swept fan blades that have
pith control and reduction gearing similar to propfans, but the fans are enclosed in
ducts like turbofan engines [1]. Bypass ratio for advanced ducted fan is from 15:1 to
25:1 [30]. There are two basic types: one with geared, variable pitch, single
propeller fan, and the other with counter-rotating blades. Extensive work has
been done in some aero engine manufacturing companies like Pratt & Whitney,
MTU, and Fiat Avio for the design of this type of engines. A thin-lip, slim-line
nacelled is required to give such a high bypass ratio.
1.3.3
Other Power Sources
This third and last group of aircraft engines (identiﬁed as others) is subdivided into
human- and electric-powered engines.
1.3.3.1
Electric-Powered Aircraft
An electric aircraft is an aircraft that runs on electric motors rather than internal
combustion engines, with electricity coming from fuel cells, solar cells, ultra
capacitors, power beaming, and/or batteries. The advantages of electric aircraft
include increased safety due to decreased chance of mechanical failure, such as
from volcanic ash, less risk of explosion or ﬁre in the event of a collision, less noise,
and no emissions and pollution. The main disadvantage of electric aircraft is
decreased range. The range can be increased by adding solar cells to the aircraft’s
body to create a solar airplane. However, the plane’s surface area must be large
compared to its weight to have a signiﬁcant impact on range. Electric powered
model aircraft have been ﬂown since the 1970s including manned and unmanned

aerial vehicles. About 60 electrically powered aircrafts have been designed since
the 1960s, some are used as military drones..
The 27 lb (12 kg) unmanned AstroFlight Sunrise was the world’s ﬁrst solar-
powered ﬂight ﬂew on 4 November 1974. The improved Sunrise II ﬂew on
27 September 1975 at Nellis AFB.
The world’s ﬁrst ofﬁcial ﬂight in a manned solar-powered aircraft took place on
29 April 1979 [30]. The aircraft used photovoltaic cells that produced 350 W at
30 V.
The aircraft was capable of powering the motor for 3–5 min, following a 1.5 h
charge, enabling it to reach a gliding altitude. The Solar Challenger set an altitude
record of 14,300 f. on 7 July 1981 and ﬂew 163 miles from Cormeilles-en-Vexin
Airport near Paris across the English Channel to RAF Manston near London. The
German Solair 1 employed 2500 wing-mounted solar cells giving an output of
2.2 kW (3 hp) with an aircraft weight of 180 kg (397 lb). The aircraft ﬁrst ﬂew was
on 21 August 1983, while the ﬁrst ﬂight of Solair II took place 2 years later in Mai
1998 [31].
NASA Pathﬁnder (Fig. 1.79) and Helios were a series of solar and fuel cell
system-powered unmanned aircraft.
In 1990, the solar powered airplane Sunseeker successfully ﬂew across the USA.
It used a small battery charged by solar cells on the wing to drive a propeller for
takeoff, and then ﬂew on direct solar power and took advantage of soaring condi-
tions when possible.
The Sunseeker II, built in 2002, was updated in 2005–2006 with a more powerful
motor, larger wing, lithium battery packs, and updated control electronics. As of
December 2008, it was the only manned solar-powered airplane in ﬂying condition
and is operated regularly by Solar Flight (Fig. 1.80). In 2009, it became the ﬁrst
solar-powered aircraft to cross the Alps.
China’s ﬁrst solar-powered aircraft “Soaring” was designed and built in 1992.
The body and wings are hand-built predominantly of carbon ﬁber, Kevlar,
and wood.

Solar Impulse prototype had its ﬁrst short-hop (350 m) test ﬂight on 3 December
2009 (Fig. 1.81). In its present conﬁguration, it has a wingspan of 64 m, weighs
1588 k,g and powered by four 10-horsepower (7 kW) electric motors each turning a
propeller. Solar Impulse will capture sunlight using 12,000 photovoltaic cells on its
wings and horizontal stabilizer. Power from the solar cells is stored in lithium
polymer batteries and used to drive 3.5-m (11 ft) propellers turning at speed of
200–400 rpm. Take-off speed is 19 knots (35 km/h) and cruising speed is 60 knots
(111 km/h). The aircraft had its ﬁrst high ﬂight on 7 April 2010, when it ﬂew to an
altitude of 1200 m (3937 ft) in a 1.5 h ﬂight on battery power alone. In July 2010,
Solar impulse’s HB-SIA prototype airplane made its ﬁrst successful night ﬂight
attempt at Payerne airport. The aircraft took off July 7 at 06:51 am and reached an
altitude of 8700 m (28,543 ft) by the end of the day. It then slowly descent to 1500
m (4921 ft) and ﬂew during the night on the batteries, charged during the day by
12,000 solar cells, which powered the four electric motors. It landed July 8 at
09.00 am (GMT 2) for a ﬂight time of 26 h 9 min setting the longest and highest
ﬂight ever made by a solar plane. Later on, it completed successful solar-powered
ﬂights from Switzerland to Spain and then Morocco in 2012, and conducted a multi-
stage ﬂight across the United States in 2013.
In 2014, Solar Impulse 2 was manufactured with more solar cells and powerful
motors. In March 2015, it began an attempt to circumnavigate the globe with Solar
Impulse 2, departing from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. By 1 June 2015,
the plane had traversed Asia. On 3 July 2015, the plane completed the longest leg of
its journey, from Japan to Hawaii, but the aircraft’s batteries experienced thermal
damage that is expected to take months to repair.

1.3.3.2
Human-Powered Aircraft (HPA)
A human-powered aircraft (HPA) is an aircraft capable of sustained, controlled
ﬂight by human power alone through an act of pedaling, which activates a mech-
anism for turning a propeller for thrust (Fig. 1.82). HPA inevitably experience assist
from thermals or rising air currents. Pure HPA do not use hybrid ﬂows of energy
(solar energy, wound rubber band, fuel cell, etc.) for thrust. The ﬁrst recorded
successful HPA ﬂight happened in 1936 through the “Pedaliante”, an aircraft built
and designed in Italy. As of 2008, human-powered aircraft have been successfully
ﬂown over considerable distances. However, they are primarily constructed as an
engineering challenge rather than for any kind of recreational or utilitarian purpose.
1.3.3.2.1
Closure
It is evident from this chapter how mankind’s life is now increasingly dependent on
aircrafts. In both civil and war, airplanes have its essential role. Detailed description
of commercial jetliners, helicopters, and defense systems are given. Thus ﬁxed and
rotary wing aircrafts utilized in both civil and military ﬁelds are fully classiﬁed.

Civilian ﬁxed wing aircrafts are employed both in passengers and freight transpor-
tation, search and rescue, agricultural, research, ﬁre ﬁghting, and training activities.
Fixed wing military aircrafts display itself in battle ﬁelds as ﬁghter, ground attack,
bombers, and rescue, while transport, search and rescue, training as well as
ﬁreﬁghting. Reconnaissance and refueling aircrafts ﬂy between conﬂict areas and
air force bases. Rotary wing aircrafts are also extensively seen both in civil and
military disciplines. It has the capability to take off/land in unpaved areas. Tourism,
search and rescue, ﬁreﬁghting, and police works are some of its civilian activities.
Transport, ﬁghting, bombing, and rescue are some important military applications.
Moreover, various propulsion systems are thoroughly described. Both shaft and
reaction engines are classiﬁed. Internal combustion engines are one class of shaft
engines that has three main groups, namely: Wankel, piston, and turbine types.
Turbine group is again subdivided into turboprop, turboshaft, and propfan engines.
Other shaft engines are either solar- or human-powered type. Reaction engines are
the most dominant power plants including ramjet, pulsejet, turbojet, turbofan, turbo
ramjet, and turbo rocket engines. Turbofan engines are the mostly employed
airbreathing engines in both civil and military ﬁxed wing applications. Turboshaft
engines are the present unique power plants used in helicopters. Turboprop engines
power most of the heavy transport civil and military aircrafts.
Detailed analyses for all of the above power plants will be given in this book. It is
categorized as ram-based engines, turbine-based engines and shaft-based engines.
A complete chapter is devoted for each group.

A Review of Basic Laws
for a Compressible Flow
2.1
Introduction
The operation of aero engines and rockets is governed by the laws of ﬂuid
mechanics (or more speciﬁcally aerodynamics and gas dynamics) as well as
thermodynamics. Understanding and analyzing the performance of aero engines
and rocket motors requires a closed set of governing equations (conservation of
mass and energy, linear and angular momentums, entropy) as well as several
compressible ﬂow relations that govern the isentropic ﬂow, normal and oblique
shock waves, expansion waves, and ﬁnally Fanno and Rayleigh ﬂow. For under-
standing the basic physical phenomena, gas will be modeled as a perfect gas, and
apart from the rotating elements (fans, compressors, and turbines), the ﬂow will be
assumed one dimensional, where its properties are assumed constant across the ﬂow
and vary only in the ﬂow direction (axial direction). It is assumed that the students
have studied a ﬁrst course in both ﬂuid mechanics and thermodynamics. A review
of thermo-ﬂuid physics and one-dimensional gas dynamics will be given in this
chapter. For more details, students are asked to refer to the following set of
textbooks: Shames and White [1, 2] for ﬂuid mechanics and Shapiro, Zucrow and
Hoffman, and Zucker [3–5] for gas dynamics together with Keenan, Sonntag,
et al. as well as Cengel and Boles [6–8] for thermodynamics.
Macroscopic approach rather than microscopic one will be followed here. The
concepts of system and control volume are followed in specifying a deﬁnite
collection of material and a region in space that will be analyzed.

2.2
System and Control Volume
A system is a collection of matter of ﬁxed identity. It may be considered enclosed by
an invisible, massless, ﬂexible surface through which may change shape, and
position, but must always entail the same matter. For example, one may choose
the steam in an engine cylinder (Fig. 2.1) as a system. As the piston moves, the
volume of the system changes, but there is no change in the quantity and identity of
mass. The terms system and control mass have identical meaning.
A control volume is a region of constant shape and size that is ﬁxed in space
relative to the observer. The boundary of this volume is known as the control
surface. This control surface may be imagined as massless, invisible, and rigid
envelope which offers no resistance to the passage of mass. The amount and
identity of the matter in the control volume may change with the time, but the
shape of the control volume is ﬁxed. For instance, to study ﬂow through a variable
geometry duct, one could choose, as a control volume, the interior of the duct as
shown in Fig. 2.1. We note that the control volume and the system can be
inﬁnitesimal.
2.3
Fundamental Equations
Four basic laws must be satisﬁed for the continuous medium (or continuum) inside
aero engines and rocket motors, namely:
1. Conservation of matter (continuity equation)
2. Newton’s second law (momentum and moment-of-momentum equations)
3. Conservation of energy (ﬁrst law of thermodynamics)
4. Second law of thermodynamics
In addition to these general laws, there are numerous subsidiary laws, sometimes
called constitutive relations, that apply to speciﬁc types of media, like the equation
of state for the prefect gas and Newton’s viscosity law for certain viscous ﬂuids.
Furthermore, for high-speed ﬂows additional compressible ﬂow features have to be

governed by isentropic, Rayleigh and Fanno ﬂow relations together with normal
and oblique shock relations if encountered. In thermodynamics we have two kinds
of properties of a substance. These whose measure depends on the amount of mass
of the substance are called extensive properties, and those whose measure is
independent of the amount of mass of the substance present are called intensive
properties. Temperature and pressure are two famous examples for intensive
properties. Examples of extensive properties are weight, momentum, volume, and
energy. Each extensive variable such as enthalpy (H) and energy (E), we have H
¼
ððð
hρdv and E ¼
ððð
eρdv:, has its intensive properties: (h) and (e).
Consider next an arbitrary ﬂow ﬁeld V (x,y,z,t) as seen from some frame of
reference xyz wherein we observe a system of ﬂuid of ﬁnite mass at times “t” and “
t þ Δt” as shown in Fig. 2.2. The streamlines correspond to those at time “t.” In
addition to this system, we will consider that the volume in space occupied by the
system at time “t” is the control volume ﬁxed in position and shape in xyz. Hence, at
time “t” our system is identical to the ﬂuid inside our control volume. Let us now
consider some arbitrary extensive property “N” of the ﬂuid. The distribution of “N”
per unit mass will be given as “η” such that N ¼
ððð
ηρdv with dv representing an
element of volume.
We have divided up the overlapping systems at time “t þ Δt” and at time “t” into
three regions, as shown in Fig. 2.2. The region II is common to the system at both
times “t” and “t þ Δt.” Let us compute the rate of change of N with respect to time
for the system by the following limiting process:

Equation (2.3) is called Reynolds transport equation. This equation permits us to
change from a system approach to a control–volume approach.
2.3.1
Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation)
Now, let us apply Reynolds transport Eq. (2.3) to reach the continuity rquation. In
this case:
1. The extensive property “N” is the mass of a ﬂuid system “M.”
2. The quantity “η” is unity, since M ¼

Since we can choose a system of any shape at time “t,” the relation above is then
valid for any control volume at time “t” as follows:

That is, the net efﬂux rate of mass through the control surface equals the rate of
decrease of mass inside the control volume. Equation (2.4) and its simpliﬁed forms
are called equation of continuity.
If the ﬂow is steady relative to a reference ﬁxed to the control volume, all ﬂuid
properties, including the density at any ﬁxed position in the reference, must remain
invariant with time. The right side of Eq. (2.4) can be written in the form
ððð
∂ρ=∂t
ð
Þdv;, and this integral is zero. Hence, we can state that any steady ﬂow
∯
C:S:

ð2:5aÞ
Next, consider the case of incompressible ﬂow, in this case, ρ is constant at all
positions in the domain and for all even if the velocity ﬁeld is unsteady. The right
side of Eq. (2.4) vanishes then, and on the left side of this equation, we can extract ρ
from under the integral sign. We then arrive at the relation:
∯
C:S:

¼ 0
ð2:5bÞ
Thus, for any incompressible ﬂow, conservation of mass reduces to conservation of
volume. Let us consider the very common situation in which ﬂuid enters some
device through a pipe and leaves the device through a second pipe, as shown
diagrammatically in Fig. 2.3. A dashed line indicates the chosen control surface.
We assume that the ﬂow is steady relative to the control volume and that the inlet
and outlet ﬂows are one dimensional. Applying Eq. (2.5a) for this case, we get

FR is the resultant external force and P is the linear momentum vector.
FR is classiﬁed as the surface force and body force distributions. The surface
force is denoted as T (x, y, z, t) and given as force per unit area on the boundary
surfaces. The body force distribution is denoted as B (x,y,z,t) and given as force per
unit mass. For example, gravity is the most common body force distribution, and
thus, B ¼ – g K. We can rewrite Eq. (2.7) as follows:

This equation then equates the sum of these force distributions with the rate of

In using Eq. (2.11), one selects directions for the positive directions of the inertial
reference axes x, y, and z. Then the positive directions of the velocities Vx, Vy, and
Vz, as well as the surface and body force Tx and Bx, and so on, are established.
Example 2.1 A turbojet engine is powering an aircraft ﬂying at a speed of (u) as
shown in Fig. 2.4. Air ﬂows into the engine at the rate of (m
a) through the inlet area
(Ai). Fuel is injected into the combustors at the rate of (m
f). The exhaust gases are
leaving the propelling nozzle at the rate of (m

(Ae). The ambient and exit pressures are (Pa and Pe). Prove that the generated thrust

Figure 2.4, illustrates a turbojet engine with a part of its pod installation (which
is a structural support for hanging the engine to the wing). It also deﬁnes a control
volume which control surface passes through the engine outlet (exhaust) plane
(2) and extends far upstream at (1). The two side faces of the control volume are
parallel to the ﬂight velocity u. The upper surface cuts the structural support, while
the lower one is far below the engine. The surface area at planes (1) and (2) is equal
and denoted A. The stream tube of air entering the engine has an area Ai at plane (1),
while the exhaust area for gases leaving the engine is Ae. Over plane (1), the
velocity and pressure are u (which is the ﬂight speed) and Pa (ambient pressure at
this altitude). The velocity and pressure over plane (2) are still u and Pa except over
the exhaust area of the engine Ae which values are ue and Pe. The x- and y-directions
employed here are chosen parallel and normal to the centerline of the engine.
The following assumptions are assumed:
1. The ﬂow is steady within the control volume; thus, all the properties within the
control do not change with time.
2. The external ﬂow is reversible; thus, the pressures and velocities are constants
over the control surface except over the exhaust area Pe of the engine.

Solution
At ﬁrst, it is worthy deﬁning aerial refueling (which is also identiﬁed as air
refueling, in-ﬂight refueling (IFR), air-to-air refueling (AAR), or tanking) as the
process of transferring fuel from one aircraft (the tanker) to another (the receiver)
during ﬂight. When applied to helicopters, it is known as HAR for helicopter aerial
refueling. A series of air refueling can give range limited only by crew fatigue and
engineering factors such as engine oil consumption.
Now, back to our problem, consider a control volume starting from the probe to
the fuel tank. This is an inertial control volume with the positive x-direction parallel
to aircraft ﬂight direction.
Thus the linear momentum equation in the x-direction is

Example 2.3 The idling turbojet engines of a landing airplane produce forward
thrust when operating in a normal manner, but they can produce reverse thrust if the
jet is properly deﬂected. Suppose that, while the aircraft rolls down the runway at
180 km/h, the idling engine consumes air at 40 kg/s and produces an exhaust
velocity of 150 m/s.
(a)
What is the forward thrust of the engine?
(b)
What is the magnitude and direction (forward or reverse) if the exhaust is

Solution
Forward thrust has positive values and reverse thrust has negative values.

is acted on by a forcedFand has a linear momentum (mdV). From Newton’s law, we
can write

Note that Dr=Dt ¼ V, so that the ﬁrst expression on the right side is zero, since

Thus, we arrive at the relation:
r 	 dF ¼ D

A Review of Basic Laws for a Compressible Flow

Example 2.4 An impulse turbine blade row is illustrated in Fig. 2.7a. The rotor has
an average radius r of 0.6 m and rotates at a constant angular speed ω. What is the
transverse torque on the turbine if the air mass ﬂow rate is 100 kg/s?
Solution
Choosing the shown control volume described in Fig. 2.7a, and assuming the ﬂow is

Energy Equation (First Law of Thermodynamics)
The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is a statement of macroscopic experience which
states that energy must at all times be conserved. It will be convenient to classify
energy under two main categories: stored energy and energy in transition. The types
of stored energy of an element of mass are:
1. Kinetic energy Ek: energy associated with the motion of the mass
2. Potential energy EP: energy associated with the position of the mass in conser-
vative external ﬁelds
3. Internal energy U: molecular and atomic energy associated with the internal
ﬁelds of the mass
The types of energy in transition are heat and work. Heat is the energy in
transition from one mass to another as a result of a temperature difference. On
the other hand, work, as learned in mechanics, is the energy in transition to or from
a system which occurs when external forces, acting on the system, move through a
distance.
For an arbitrary system (shown in Fig. 2.8), the net heat added to the system and
the net work done by the system on the surroundings during the time interval Δt are
designated as Q and Wk, respectively.

A Review of Basic Laws for a Compressible Flow

If E represents the total stored energy of a system at any time t and its property as
a point function is employed, conservation of energy demands that for a process
occurring during a time interval between t1 and t2, then

The differential form of Eq. (2.16) may be written in the following manner:
dE ¼ dQ  dWk
Accordingly, we can employ the usual derivative notation dQ/dt and dWk/dt for
time derivative. However, E is a point function and expressible in terms of spatial
variables and time. Thus, we have for the time variations of stored energy and
energy in transition for a system.

To develop the control–volume approach, we will consider E being the extensive
property to be used in the Reynolds transport equation. The term (e) will then
represent stored energy per unit mass. We can then say using the Reynolds transport
equation

Equation (2.19) then states that the net rate of energy transferred into the control
volume by heat and work equals the rate of efﬂux of stored energy from control
volume plus the rate of increase of stored energy inside the control volume.
Where (e) is expressed as
e ¼ V2
2 þ gz þ u
ð2:20Þ
Next let us discuss the term dWk/dt in Eq. (2.19) which is classiﬁed into three
groups:
1. Net work done on the surroundings as a result of traction force T.
2.3
Fundamental Equations
107

2. Any other work transferred by direct contact between inside and outside
non-ﬂuid elements, like shafts or by electric currents. We call this work shaft
work and denote it as WS.
3. Work transferred by body forces. Since the effects of gravity have already been
taken into account as the potential energy (in Eq. 2.20), so the body force B must
not include gravity; it may include, for instance, contributions from magnetic
and electric force distributions.
Referring to Fig. 2.9, the time rate of the work leaving the control volume—the
total rate of ﬂow work—is given as

A Review of Basic Laws for a Compressible Flow

Figure 2.10 illustrates a simple example for a steady ﬂow device having
one-dimensional inlet and outlet ﬂows. This may represent, for instance, a gas
turbine having inlet and outlet at sections AA and BB. The traction force power
occurs at sections AA and BB and is given as þp1V1A1 and p2V2A2, respectively.
Furthermore, ρV  dA at these sections becomes ρ1V1A1 and þρ2V2A2;, respec-

If the following assumptions are satisﬁed:
1. The ﬂow is steady.
2. Air is an ideal gas with constant speciﬁc heats.
3. Potential energy changes are negligible (gz1 ¼ gz2 ¼ 0).
4. There are no work interactions (dWs

conditions are pressure ¼ 150 kPa and temperature ¼ 50 C. The speciﬁc heat at
constant pressure is 1.007 kJ/kg. K. Calculate the velocity at outlet to diffuser.
Solution
Since the above-listed assumptions hold (steady ﬂow with negligible changes in

speciﬁc heats), then Eq. (2.25) may be applied. Thus,

The Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Entropy
Equation
The second law of thermodynamics states that: it is impossible for a system to
perform a cyclic process that produces work (say raising of a weight) and
exchanges heat with a single reservoir of uniform temperature. The second law
permits the deﬁnition of the property entropy (s). For a system,

A Review of Basic Laws for a Compressible Flow

where ds is the change of entropy during a reversible heat exchange. Irreversible
processes are processes which involve one of these features: friction, heat transfer
with ﬁnite temperature gradient, mass transfer with ﬁnite concentration gradient, or
unrestrained expansion. For any process,
ds  dQ
T
ð2:27Þ
where equality holds only for reversible process. If the process is reversible and
adiabatic (dQ ¼ 0), it must be isentropic (ds ¼ 0).
For a small system composed of pure substance in the absence of gravity motion,
then if the properties are uniform throughout the system, then the ﬁrst law for
incremental changes is
dq ¼ du þ dw
where q and w are the heat and work per unit mass. If the system experiences a
reversible process for which the incremental work dw ¼ pdv, then from Eq. (2.28),
we can write
Tds ¼ du þ pdv
ð2:28Þ
2.3.6
Equation of State
In compressible gases, it is necessary to deﬁne the thermodynamic state of the gas
with state variables, e. g., the static pressure p, the static density ρ, and the static
temperature T. Their interdependence is described by the thermal equation of state.
If the law given by Boyle, Mariotte, and Gay-Lussac is used, then
p ¼ ρRT
ð2:29Þ
The gas is called thermally perfect. For thermally non-perfect gases, other
relations must be used, as, for example, the Van der Waals law. The speciﬁc gas
constant R depends on the molecular weight of the gas. For air it is R ¼ 287 J/kg K.
The gas constant is related to the universal gas constant (Ru) and the molecular
weight of gas (M) by the relation
R ¼ R u
M
The value of universal gas constant is Ru ¼ 8:31434

The enthalpy h was deﬁned earlier and repeated here is deﬁned as

For monatomic gases (n ¼ 3) γ ¼ 1.667, and for diatomic gases (n ¼ 5) γ ¼ 1.4. At

Steady One-Dimensional Compressible Flow
One-dimensional ﬂow refers to ﬂow involving uniform distributions of ﬂuid prop-
erties over any ﬂow cross section area. It provides accurately the stream-wise
variation of average ﬂuid properties. The ﬂow in diffusers, combustors, and nozzles
exhibits
the
major
characteristics
of
one-dimensional
ﬂow.
Though
one-dimensional analysis for the ﬂow in rotating elements (fans, compressors,
and turbines) provides also the mean ﬂow features, it is more appropriate to extend
the analysis of ﬂow within them to either two dimensional (2-D) or three dimen-
sional (3-D). This is attributed to the large variations normal to streamlines, which
are no longer limited to the thin layer adjacent to the surface and known as
boundary layer.
2.4.1
Isentropic Relations
It follows from the conservation equations for one-dimensional, steady, compress-
ible ﬂow that the sum of the kinetic energy (u2/2) and the static enthalpy (h) remains
constant. The value of this constant is given by the stagnation (or total) enthalpy,
and Eq. (2.25) may be rewritten as
h0 ¼ h þ u2=2
ð2:25Þ
Generally, the stagnation state is a theoretical state in which the ﬂow is brought into
a complete motionless condition in isentropic process without other forces (e.g.,
gravity force).
Several properties can be represented by this theoretical process which includes
temperature, pressure, density, etc. and denoted by the subscript “0.”
For calorically perfect gases, the enthalpy can be replaced by the product of
static temperature and the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure (CpT), thus,
CpT0 ¼ CpT þ u2=2

Classiﬁcation of Mach Regimes
Aerodynamicists often classify airﬂow regimes using Mach number values. Six
ﬂight regimes may be identiﬁed, namely, subsonic, transonic, supersonic, hyper-
sonic, high hypersonic, and re-entry ones. Subsonic and supersonic speeds are
associated with values of Mach number less or greater than unity, respectively.
An in-between region deﬁned as “transonic regime” where Mach number is around
unity (from say 0.8 to 1.2). Mach values associated with supersonic regime vary
from 1.2 to 5. For hypersonic regime Mach number ranges from 5 to 10. NASA
deﬁnes “high” hypersonic when Mach number ranges from 10 to 25 and re-entry
speeds as anything greater than Mach 25 (Space Shuttle as an application). Table 2.4
illustrates such a classiﬁcation.

Diffusers and Nozzles
Diffusers and nozzles are commonly utilized in jet engines, rockets, and spacecrafts.
A diffuser is a device that increases the pressure of a ﬂuid by slowing it down, while a
nozzle is a device that increases the velocity of a ﬂuid at the expense of pressure. That
is, diffusers and nozzles perform opposite tasks. Diffusers and nozzles involve no
work (W
  0) and negligible changes in potential energy (ΔPE  0). Moreover, the
rate of heat transfer between the ﬂuid ﬂowing through a diffuser or a nozzle and the
surroundings is usually very small (Q

 0). This is due to the very short time air
(or gas) spends in either duct (few or fraction of milliseconds) which is insufﬁcient
for a signiﬁcant heat transfer to take place. However, ﬂuid passing through diffusers
and nozzles experiences large changes in velocity. Therefore, the kinetic energy
changes must be accounted for (ΔKE 6¼ 0). The shape of both diffuser and nozzle
may be convergent or divergent depending on the velocity of ﬂowing ﬂuid. Rockets
and military high supersonic aircrafts normally have convergent–divergent or CD
nozzles. In a CD rocket nozzle, the hot exhaust leaves the combustion chamber and
converges down to the minimum area, or throat, of the nozzle. The throat size is
chosen to choke the ﬂow and set the mass ﬂow rate through the system. The ﬂow in
the throat is sonic which means the Mach number is equal to one in the throat.
Downstream of the throat, the geometry diverges, and the ﬂow is isentropically
expanded to a supersonic Mach number that depends on the area ratio of the exit to
the throat. The expansion of a supersonic ﬂow causes the static pressure and temper-
ature to decrease from the throat to the exit, so the amount of the expansion also
determines the exit pressure and temperature. The exit temperature determines the
exit speed of sound, which determines the exit velocity. The exit velocity, pressure,
and mass ﬂow through the nozzle determine the amount of thrust produced by the
nozzle.
2.4.4.1
Variation of Fluid Velocity with Flow Area
We begin with the conservation of mass equation:
_m ¼ ρVA ¼ constant
where _m: is the mass ﬂow rate, ρ is the gas density, V is the gas velocity, and A is the
cross-sectional ﬂow area. If we differentiate this equation, we obtain
VAdρ þ ρAdV þ ρVdA ¼ 0
Divide by (ρVA) to get

A ¼ 0
Now we use the conservation of momentum equation:
ρVdV ¼ dP
and an isentropic ﬂow relation: Tds ¼ dh  vdP
dP
P ¼ γ dρ
ρ
where γ is the ratio of speciﬁc heats. Rewrite the above equation to obtain
dP ¼ γP
ρ dρ
and use the equation of state (P
ρ ¼ RT) to get
dP ¼ γRTdρ
Since (γRT) is the square of the speed of sound (a), then
dP ¼ a2dρ
Combining this equation for the change in pressure with the momentum equation,
we obtain
ρVdV ¼  a2dρ
V
a2 dV ¼  dρ

using the deﬁnition of the Mach number M ¼ V=a, then

 dV

ð2:54Þ
Equation (2.59) tells us how the velocity (V) changes when the area (A) changes
and the results depend on the Mach number (M) of the ﬂow.

If the ﬂow is subsonic then (M < 1:0)—the term multiplying the velocity change
is positive [ 1  M2


> 0]—then an increase in the area (dA > 0) produces a
decrease in the velocity (dV < 0), which is the case of a diffuser. On the contrary a
decrease in the area produces an increase in velocity, which is the case of a nozzle.
For a supersonic ﬂow ( M > 1:0 ), the term multiplying velocity change is
negative [ 1  M2


< 0 ]. Then an increase in the area ( dA > 0 ) produces an
increase in the velocity (dV > 0) or a nozzle. The decrease in the area leads to a
decrease in velocity or a diffuser.
Table 2.5 summarizes this behavior.
Figure 2.12 illustrates the geometry of diffusers and nozzles in subsonic and
supersonic speeds.
For the case of CD nozzle, if the ﬂow in the throat is subsonic, the ﬂow
downstream of the throat will decelerate and stay subsonic. So if the converging
section is too large and does not choke the ﬂow in the throat, the exit velocity is very
slow and does not produce much thrust. On the other hand, if the converging section
is small enough so that the ﬂow chokes in the throat, then a slight increase in area
causes the ﬂow to go supersonic. This is exactly the opposite of what happens
subsonically.

A Review of Basic Laws for a Compressible Flow

Example 2.7 Air at 5 C and 80 kPa enters the diffuser of a jet engine steadily with
a velocity of 200 m/s. The inlet area of the diffuser is 0.4 m2. The air leaves the
diffuser with a velocity that is very small compared with the inlet velocity.
Determine (a) the mass ﬂow rate of the air and (b) the temperature of the air leaving
the diffuser.
Solution
We take the diffuser as the system (Fig. 2.13). This is a control volume since mass
crosses the system boundary during the process. We observe that there is only one
inlet and one exit and thus _m 1 ¼ _m 2 ¼ _m: .
(a)
To determine the mass ﬂow rate, we need to ﬁnd the density of the air ﬁrst.
This is determined from the ideal gas relation at the inlet conditions:

the cross-sectional area is 400 cm2. Find the Mach number at point H. Assume that

A Review of Basic Laws for a Compressible Flow

Both solutions are possible, the ﬁrst is still a subsonic Mach number which may
be located in the convergent section, while the second one is supersonic which may
be located in the divergent section if the speed at throat is sonic: Mthroat ¼ 1:0.
2.4.5
Shocks
A shock is an irreversible ﬂow discontinuity in a (partly) supersonic ﬂow ﬂuid. It
may be also deﬁned as a pressure front which travels at speed through a gas. Upon
crossing the shock waves, pressure, temperature, density, and entropy rise while the
normal velocity decreases. There are two types of shocks, namely, normal and
oblique.
2.4.5.1
Normal Shock Waves
Consider a plane supersonic ﬂow with a normal compression shock in a channel
with constant cross-sectional area (Fig. 2.14). The conditions upstream and down-
stream the shock are denoted by subscripts (1) and (2), respectively. Under the
following assumptions—steady, one dimensional, adiabatic (δq ¼ 0), no shaft work
(δw ¼ 0), negligible potential (δz ¼ 0), constant area (A1 ¼ A2) and negligible wall
shear—then equations of state and integral forms of conservation equations will
have the following forms:

Equations (2.56), (2.57), (2.58), (2.59), and (2.60) are plotted in Fig. 2.15.
We can state two simple rules of thumb:
1. A normal shock wave always forms between supersonic and subsonic ﬂow.
2. The ﬂow behind a normal shock wave is always subsonic.
Normal shock waves are encountered in the ﬂow in intakes and nozzles as well
as over aircraft wings. Figure 2.16 illustrates normal shock waves formed on the
suction or both suction and pressure surfaces of wing sections.
It is obvious that a very useful table for ﬂuid ﬂow changes across a normal shock
can be constructed using the above equations. This kind of table is available in all
gas dynamics or compressible ﬂow texts [4, 5]. Table 2.6 illustrates these relations.
You are encouraged to complete missing data in Table 2.6.

The temperature–entropy diagram is illustrated by Fig. 2.17, which shows the static
and total conditions upstream and downstream of the shock. Note the entropy
increased despite not including any entropy-generating mechanisms in this
model. Why? First, the differential equations themselves required the assumption
of continuous differentiable functions. Our shock violates this.
When one returns to the more fundamental control volume forms, it can be
shown that the entropy-generating mechanism returns. From a continuum point of
view, one can also show that the neglected terms, that momentum and energy
diffusion, actually give rise to a smeared shock. These mechanisms generate just
enough entropy to satisfy the entropy jump which was just calculated.
Another interpretation may be also given as follows: the assumption that the
compression shock represents a discontinuity is only an approximation. In reality
the shock has a thickness (δ) of the order of magnitude of several free mean paths. If
the gas ﬂowing through the shock can be assumed to be a continuum, the Navier–
Stokes equations can be employed for the description of the ﬂow between the
upstream and downstream edge of the compression shock. The ﬂow quantities do
not change discontinuously in the form of a jump but in a continuous transition from
the free-stream conditions to the ﬂow conditions downstream from the shock. The
increase of the entropy can now be explained as an action of the frictional forces
and the heat conduction within the shock region of ﬁnite thickness.

Off Design and Normal Shock Waves in Nozzles
The objective of CD nozzle is to obtain supersonic ﬂow. Thus, the design operating
condition is to have a subsonic ﬂow in the convergent section, a sonic condition at
throat, and a supersonic ﬂow in the divergent part. For off-design conditions, many
possibilities for the speed at the nozzle exit may be encountered depending on the
back pressure Pb. The ﬂuid may ﬁnd itself decelerating in the diverging section
instead of accelerating. A detailed description is given with the aid of Fig. 2.18.
When a ﬂuid enters the nozzle with a low velocity at stagnation pressure P0, the
state of the nozzle ﬂow is determined by the overall pressure ratio Pb/P0. When the
back pressure Pb ¼ P0 (case A), there will be no ﬂow through the nozzle. This is
expected since the ﬂow in a nozzle is driven by the pressure difference between the
nozzle inlet and the exit. Now let us examine what happens as the back pressure is
lowered.
1. When P0 > Pb > PC (critical pressure), the ﬂow remains subsonic throughout
the nozzle, and the mass ﬂow is less than that for choked ﬂow. The ﬂuid velocity
increases in the converging section and reaches a maximum at the throat (but
still subsonic; M < 1). However, most of the gain in velocity is lost in the
diverging section of the nozzle, which acts as a diffuser. The pressure decreases
in the converging section, reaches a minimum at the throat, and increases at the
expense of velocity in the diverging section.
2. When Pb ¼ PC, the throat pressure becomes P* and the ﬂuid achieves sonic
velocity at the throat. But the diverging section of the nozzle still acts as a
diffuser, slowing the ﬂuid to subsonic velocities. The mass ﬂow rate that was
increasing with decreasing Pb also reaches its maximum value. Recall that P* is
the lowest pressure that can be obtained at the throat, and the sonic velocity is the
highest velocity that can be achieved with a converging nozzle. Thus, lowering
Pb further has no inﬂuence on the ﬂuid ﬂow in the converging part of the nozzle
or the mass ﬂow rate through the nozzle. However, it does inﬂuence the
character of the ﬂow in the diverging section. This mode of operation is
frequently called the ﬁrst critical [5].
3. When PC > Pb > PE, the ﬂuid that achieved a sonic velocity at the throat
continues accelerating to supersonic velocities in the diverging section as the
pressure decreases. This acceleration comes to a sudden stop, however, as a
normal shock develops at a section between the throat and the exit plane, which
causes a sudden drop in velocity to subsonic levels and a sudden increase in
pressure. This mode of operation is frequently called the second critical [5]. The
ﬂuid then continues to decelerate further in the remaining part of the
converging–diverging nozzle. Flow through the shock is highly irreversible,
and thus it cannot be approximated as isentropic. The normal shock moves
downstream away from the throat as Pb is decreased, and it approaches the
nozzle exit plane as Pb approaches PE. When Pb ¼ PE, the normal shock forms
at the exit plane of the nozzle. The ﬂow is supersonic through the entire
diverging section in this case, and it can be approximated as isentropic.

However, the ﬂuid velocity drops to subsonic levels just before leaving the
nozzle as it crosses the normal shock.
4. When PE > Pb > 0, the ﬂow in the diverging section is supersonic, and the ﬂuid
expands to PF at the nozzle exit with no normal shock forming within the nozzle.
Thus, the ﬂow through the nozzle can be approximated as isentropic. When
Pb ¼ PF, no shocks occur within or outside the nozzle. This mode of operation is
frequently called the third critical [5]. When Pb < PF (underexpanded case),
irreversible mixing and expansion waves occur downstream of the exit plane of
the nozzle. When Pb > PF (overexpanded case), however, the pressure of the
ﬂuid increases from PF to Pb irreversibly in the wake of the nozzle exit, creating
what are called oblique shocks.
Example 2.10 A large tank with compressed air is attached into a converging–
diverging nozzle (Fig. 2.19) with pressure 8 bar and temperature of 327 C. Nozzle
throat area is 30 cm2 and the exit area is 90 cm2. The shock occurs in a location
where the cross section area is 60 cm2. Calculate the back pressure and the
temperature of the ﬂow. Also determine the critical subsonic and supersonic points
for the back pressure (point “a” and point “b”).
Solution
The stagnation temperature and pressure at the nozzle inlet are equal to the speciﬁed
values in the tank.

A Review of Basic Laws for a Compressible Flow

2.4.5.3
Oblique Shock Wave Relations
Normal shock was examined in Sect. 2.4.4.2. Normal shock is a special case of the
general inclined one. When shock is inclined to the ﬂow direction, it is identiﬁed as
an oblique shock. When a wedge-shaped object is placed in a two-dimensional
supersonic ﬂow, a plane-attached shock wave may emanate from the nose of the
body at an angle (β) as long as shown in Fig. 2.21. The ﬂow Mach number and the
wedge angle (δ) together deﬁne the resulting attached or detached shock conﬁgu-
ration. Similarly, when a supersonic ﬂow encounters a concave corner with an angle
(δ), two possibilities of attached or detached shock waves exist. Figure 2.22 illus-
trates the abovementioned four cases. There is a maximum deﬂection angle (δmax)
associated with any given Mach number. When the deﬂection angle exceeds δmax, a
detached shock forms which has a curved wave front. Behind this curved (or -
bow-like) wave, we ﬁnd all possible shock solutions associated with the initial
Mach number M1. At the center a normal shock exists, with subsonic ﬂow resulting.
As the wave front curves around, the shock angle decreases continually, with a
resultant decrease in shock strength. Eventually, we reach a point where supersonic
ﬂow exists after the shock front.
Oblique shock waves are preferred predominantly in engineering applications
compared with normal shock waves. This can be attributed to the fact that using one
or a combination of oblique shock waves results in more favorable post-shock
conditions (lower post-shock temperature and pressure) when compared to utilizing
a single normal shock. An example of this technique can be seen in the design of
supersonic aircraft engine inlets, which are wedge shaped to compress airﬂow into
the combustion chamber while minimizing thermodynamic losses. Early supersonic
aircraft jet engine inlets were designed using compression from a single normal

shock, but this approach caps the maximum achievable Mach number to roughly
1.6. The wedge-shaped inlets are clearly visible on the sides of the F-14 Tomcat,
which has a maximum speed of Mach 2.34.
For analyzing oblique shock, consider Fig. 2.23 where the ﬂow is deﬂected angle
δ, and a shock generated inclined an angle β to the ﬂow direction. The ﬂow
approaches the shock wave with a velocity V1 and Mach number M1 at an angle β
with respect to the shock. It is turned through an angle δ as it passes through the
shock, leaving with a velocity V2 and a Mach number M2 at an angle (β  δ) with
respect to the shock. The inlet and exit velocities can be separated into tangential
and normal components. The tangential velocity components upstream and down-
stream the shocks are equal. The normal velocity component may be treated as ﬂow
through a normal shock. This means that V1n is supersonic and V2n is subsonic, but
still the downstream velocity V2 is supersonic. The following relations deﬁne the
normal and tangential velocity components and Mach number for both upstream
and downstream conditions:
V1t ¼ V2t

Rayleigh Flow Equations
Rayleigh ﬂow resembles the case of a steady one-dimensional ﬂow with heat
transfer. Thus, it is appropriate to treat the ﬂow in combustion chambers as a
Rayleigh ﬂow case. Consider the ﬂuid ﬂow in Fig. 2.26. No work exchange while
heat is added (1Q2).

The Standard Atmosphere
For a ﬂuid in rest without shearing stresses, any elementary ﬂuid element will be
subjected to two types of forces, namely, surface forces due to the pressure and a
body force equal to the weight of the element. Force balance will yield the
following relation:
∇p ¼ γk
where γ is the speciﬁc weight of ﬂuid and k is the unit vector in the positive vertical
direction (opposite to the gravitational force) and
γ ¼ ρg
Thus,
∂p
∂x ¼ 0,
∂p
∂y ¼ 0,
∂p
∂z ¼ γ ¼ ρg
ð2:78Þ
The ﬁrst two derivatives in Eq. (2.78), show that the pressure does not depend on
x or y. Thus, as we move from one point to another in a horizontal plane (any plane
parallel to the x–y plane), the pressure does not change. Since p depends only on z,
the last of Eq. (2.78) can be written as the ordinary differential equation
dp
dz ¼ γ ¼ ρg
ð2:79Þ
Equation (2.79) is the fundamental equation for ﬂuids at rest and can be used to
determine how pressure changes with elevation. This equation indicates that the
pressure gradient in the vertical direction is negative; that is, the pressure decreases
as we move upward in a ﬂuid at rest. For the Earth’s atmosphere where the
variations in heights are large, on the order of thousands of feet, attention must be
given to the variation in the speciﬁc weight (γ). Since air may be considered an ideal
(or perfect) gas, its equation of state (p ¼ ρRT) is used.
This relationship can be combined with Eq. (2.79) to give

where g and R are assumed to be constant over the range of elevation involved.
Equation (2.80) relates to the variation in pressure in the Earth’s atmosphere.
Ideally, we would like to have measurements of pressure versus altitude over the
speciﬁc range of altitude. However, this type of information is usually not available.
Thus, a “standard atmosphere” has been determined that can be used in the design
of aircraft and rockets. The concept of a standard atmosphere was ﬁrst developed in
the 1920s, and since that time many US and international committees and organi-
zations have pursued the development of such a standard. The currently accepted
standard atmosphere is based on a report published in 1962 and updated in 1976
[11, 12], deﬁning the so-called US standard atmosphere, which is an idealized
representation of middle-latitude, year-round mean conditions of the Earth’s atmo-
sphere. Figure 2.27 shows the temperature proﬁle for the US standard atmosphere.

A Review of Basic Laws for a Compressible Flow

As is shown in this ﬁgure, the temperature decreases with altitude in the region
nearest the Earth’s surface (troposphere), then becomes essentially constant in the
next layer (stratosphere), and subsequently starts to increase in the next layer. Since
the temperature variation is represented by a series of linear segments, it is possible
to integrate Eq. (2.80) to obtain the corresponding pressure variation. For example,
in the troposphere, which extends to an altitude of about 11 km ’ 36, 000 ft
ð
Þ, the
temperature variation is of the form
T ¼ Ta  βz
ð2:81aÞ
where Ta is the temperature at sea level (z ¼ 0) and β is the lapse rate (the rate of
change of temperature with elevation), 0.00356616 F/ft, or 0.0019812 C/ft. For
the standard atmosphere in the troposphere, and if (z) represents altitude in feet,
then Eq. (2.81a) may be further expressed as
T ¼ 518:67  0:00356616 z R
ð2:81bÞ
T ¼ 288:15  0:0019812 z K

t ¼ 59  0:00356616 z F
ð2:81dÞ
t ¼ 15  0:0019812 z C
ð2:81eÞ
Equation (2.81a) together with Eq. (2.80) yields
p ¼ pa 1  βz
Ta

 g
βR
ð2:82Þ
where ( pa) is the absolute pressure at z ¼ 0. With pa ¼ 101.33 kPa, Ta ¼ 288.15 K
and g ¼ 9.807 m/s2, and with the gas constant R ¼ 286:9J=kg:K. The pressure
variation throughout the troposphere can be determined from Eq. (2.82). This
calculation shows that at the outer edge of the troposphere, where the temperature
is 56.5 C, the absolute pressure is about 23 kPa. It is to be noted that modern
jetliners cruise at approximately this altitude.
For the stratosphere atmospheric layer (between 11.0 and 20.1 km), the temper-
ature has a constant value (isothermal conditions) which is 56.5 C (or 69.7 F,
389.97 R, 216.65K).
It then follows from Eq. (2.80), the pressure-elevation relationship expressed as
p ¼ p0exp  g z  z0
ð
Þ
RT0
	

ð2:83Þ
where p0, T0, and z0 are the pressure, temperature, and altitude of the lower edge of
the stratosphere (23 kPa, 56.5 C, 36,000 ft).
Figure 2.28 illustrates the variation of temperature with altitude. Figure 2.29
illustrates ﬂight altitudes appropriate to different aircrafts. Table 2.9 deﬁnes the
properties of the Earth standard atmosphere [12].

2.6 A jet plane is on the runway after touching down. The pilot puts into play
movable vanes to achieve a reverse thrust from his two engines. Each engine
takes in 50 kg of air per second, The fuel-to-air ratio is 1–40. If the exit
velocity of the combustion products is 800 m/s relative to the plane, what is
the total reverse thrust of the airplane if it is moving at a speed of 180 km/h ?
The exit jets are close to atmospheric pressure.
2.7 A ﬁghter plane is climbing at an angle θ of 60o at a constant speed of
900 Km/h. The plane takes in air at a rate of 450 kg/s. The fuel-to-air ratio
is 2 %. The exit speed of the combustion products is 1800 m/s relative to the
plane. If the plane changes to an inclination angle θ of 20o, what will be the
speed of the plane when it reaches uniform speed? The new engine settings
are such that the same amount of air taken in and the exhaust speed relative
to the plane are the same. The plane weights 150 kN. The drag force is
proportional to the speed squared of the plane.
2.8 If the ﬁghter plane in problem (2.7) is climbing also at an angleθ ¼ 600 but at
a constant acceleration (a). The weight, thrust, and drag forces are 150, 715,
and 500 kN, respectively. Calculate the acceleration (a). Next, the plane
changes its angle to 200, while the air mass ﬂow rate is 450 kg/s, exhaust
speed of gases is 1800 m/s, and fuel-to-air ratio is 2 %. For the same value of
acceleration calculated above and if the drag force is proportional to the
speed squared of the plane, what will be the aircraft velocity.

Introduction
The designer of an aircraft engine must recognize the differing requirements for
take-off, climb, cruise, and maneuvering. The relative importance of these being
different for civil and military applications and for long- and short-haul aircrafts. In
the early aircrafts, it was common practice to focus on the take-off thrust. This is no
longer adequate for later and present day aircrafts. For long-range civil transports
like Boeing 747, 777, 787 and Airbus A 340, A380 (the world’s truly double-deck
airliner), A350 XWB (extra wide body), the fuel consumption through some 10 or
more ﬂight hours is the dominant parameter. Military aircrafts have numerous
criteria like the rate of climb, maneuverability for ﬁghters, short take-off distance
for aircrafts operating from air carriers, maximum ceilings for high altitude recon-
naissance aircrafts like SR-71 Blackbird aircrafts. For civil and military freighter
airplanes, the maximum payload is its main requirement.
In all types of aircrafts, the engines are requested to provide efﬁciently the thrust
force necessary for their propelling during different ﬂight phases and at different
operating conditions including hottest/coldest ambient temperature and rainy/
windy/snowing weather.
This chapter resembles a ﬁrst window for air breathing engines. It starts by a
derivation for the thrust force or the propelling force generated in the direction
opposite to the ﬂow of air entering the engine in accordance with Newton’s laws of
motion. Consequently, all jet engines including rocket motors belong to the class of
power plants called reaction engines. It is the internal imbalance of forces within
the gas turbine engines that give all reaction engines their names. The propulsive
force developed by a jet engine is the result of a complex series of actions and
reactions that occur within the engine. The thrust constituents and the different
factors affecting the thrust are next explained. Some of these factors are related to
the engine, others are related to the medium in which the engine operates.

The performance of jet engines is evaluated through the following efﬁciencies:
propulsive, thermal, and overall. The propeller efﬁciency of turboprop engines is
also evaluated. Fuel consumption is properly evaluated through a parameter
identiﬁed as the thrust-speciﬁc fuel consumption, which is the ratio of fuel ﬂow
rate into the engine to the generated thrust. Thus different jet engines may be
compared. The range of aircraft is a combined engine/aircraft parameter where
the fuel consumption through the engine is coupled to the aircraft’s lift and drag
forces.
3.2
Thrust Force
Thrust force is the force responsible for propelling the aircraft in its different ﬂight
regimes.
It is in addition to the lift, drag, and weight represent the four forces that govern
the aircraft motion. During the cruise phase of ﬂight, where the aircraft is ﬂying
steadily at a constant speed and altitude, each parallel pair of the four forces are in
equilibrium (lift and weight as well as thrust and drag). During landing, thrust force
is either fully or partially used in braking of the aircraft through a thrust reversing
mechanism. The basic conservation laws of mass and momentum are used in their
integral forms to derive an expression for thrust force.
As described in example (2.1) and Fig. 2.4, the thrust generated by a turbojet is
given by the relation:
T ¼ _m a 1 þ f
ð
Þue  u
½
 þ Pe  Pa
ð
ÞAe
ð3:1Þ
where
Net thrust ¼ T
The other types of thrusts are
Gross thrust ¼

ð
ÞAe
Momentum thrust ¼
_m a 1 þ f
ð
Þue
½

Pressure thrust ¼ (Pe  Pa)Ae
Momentum drag ¼
_m au
Thus:
Net thrust ¼ Gross thrust – Momentum drag
Or in other words,
Net thrust ¼ Momentum thrust + Pressure thrust –
Momentum drag
If the nozzle is unchoked, then Pe ¼ Pa, the pressure thrust cancels in Eq. (3.1).
The thrust is then expressed as
T ¼ _m a 1 þ f

Performance Parameters of Jet Engines

In many cases the fuel to air ratio is negligible, thus the thrust force equation is
reduced to the simple form:
T ¼ _m a ue  u
ð
Þ
ð3:3Þ
The thrust force in turbojet engine attains high values as the exhaust speed is high
and much greater than the ﬂight speed, or: ue/u  1.
In a similar way, the thrust force for two stream engines like turbofan (Fig. 3.1)
and prop fan engines can be derived. It will be expressed as
T ¼ _m h 1 þ f

Þueh  u
½
 þ _m c uec  u
ð
Þ þ Aeh Peh  Pa
ð
Þ þ Aec Pec  Pa
ð

ð3:4Þ
where
f ¼ _m f
_m h: fuel to air ratio
_m h: Air mass ﬂow passing through the hot section of engine; turbine(s)
_m eh ¼ _m h 1 þ f
ð
Þ : Mass of hot gases leaving the engine
_m c: Air mass ﬂow passing through the fan
ueh: Velocity of hot gases leaving the turbine nozzle
uec: Velocity of cold air leaving the fan nozzle
Peh: Exhaust pressure of the hot stream
Pec: Exhaust pressure of the cold stream
Aeh: Exit area for the hot stream
Aec: Exit area for the cold stream
The speciﬁc thrust is deﬁned as the thrust per unit air mass ﬂow rate (T= _m a),
which can be obtained from Eq. (3.4). It has the dimensions of a velocity (say m/s).
For turboprop engines (Fig. 3.2), the high value of thrust is achieved by the very
large quantity of the airﬂow rate, though the exhaust and ﬂight speeds are very
close. An analogous formula to Eq. (3.4) may be employed as follows:
T ¼ _m c 1 þ f

where _m 0 is the air mass ﬂow sucked by the propeller, while _m c is a part of the air
ﬂow crossed the propeller and then entered the engine through its intake. Here, u0,
u1, and ue are air speed upstream and downstream the propeller and gases speed at
the engine exhaust. The exhaust nozzle is normally unchoked.
Example 3.1 Air ﬂows through a turbojet engine at the rate of 50.0 kg/s and the fuel
ﬂow rate is 1.0 kg/s. The exhaust gases leave the jet nozzle with a relative velocity
of 600 m/s. Compute the velocity of the airplane, if the thrust power is 1.5 MW in
the following two cases:
1. Pressure equilibrium exists over the exit plane
2. If the pressure thrust is 8 kN
Solution
1. When the nozzle is unchoked, pressure equilibrium exists over the exit plane.
Then, thrust force is expressed as

Example 3.3 It is required to calculate and plot the momentum drag as well as
momentum, pressure, gross, and net thrusts versus the ﬂight speed for a turbojet
engine powering an aircraft ﬂying at 9 km (ambient temperature and pressure are
229.74 K and 30.8 kPa) and having the following characteristics, Ai ¼ 0.24 m2,
Ae ¼ 0.26 m2, f ¼ 0.02, Ue ¼ 600 m/s, Pe ¼ 87.50 kPa.
The ﬂight speed varies from 500 to 4000 km/h. Consider the following cases:
The air mass ﬂow rate is constant and equal to 40 kg/s irrespective of the
variation of ﬂight speed.

The net thrust varies linearly with the ﬂight speed. The results are plotted in
Fig. 3.4. The net thrust must be greater than the total aircraft drag force during
acceleration and equal to the drag at steady cruise ﬂight. Zero net thrust results
from the intersection of the gross thrust and ram drag. The ﬂight speed
corresponding to zero net thrust represents the maximum possible aircraft’s
speed.

Substituting for the different values of maximum temperature, we get the following
tabulated results.
It is clear from Table 3.2 that keeping a constant ratio between the maximum and
ambient pressures, then increasing the maximum total temperature will increase the
generated thrust.
3.3
Factors Affecting Thrust
As seen from Eq. (3.1) for a single stream aero engine (ramjet or turbojet engine),
the thrust force depends on the inlet and outlet air mass ﬂow rates, fuel-to-air ratio,
ﬂight speed, exhaust speed, and exhaust and ambient pressures [1]. Though it
looked like a simple task to identify the factors listed above, each of them is
dependent on several parameters. For example, the inlet air mass ﬂow rate inﬂuenc-
ing both of the momentum thrust and momentum drag is dependent on several
variables including the ﬂight speed, ambient temperature and pressure, humidity,
altitude, and rotational speed of the compressor. The outlet gas mass ﬂow rate is
dependent on the fuel added, air bleed, and water injection. The pressure thrust term
depends on the turbine inlet temperature, ﬂight altitude, and the nozzle outlet area
and pressure. The momentum thrust is also dependent on the jet nozzle velocity.
These parameters [2] and [3] can be further explained as below:

Performance Parameters of Jet Engines

3.3.1
Jet Nozzle
Pressure thrust has ﬁnite values only for choked nozzles, where the exit pressure is
greater than the ambient pressure. Nozzles are either of the convergent or
convergent–divergent (C–D) type. Only convergent nozzles may be choked. For a
choked convergent nozzle, the pressure thrust depends on both of the area of the
exhaust nozzle and also on the difference between the exit and ambient pressures.
Moreover, the exhaust speed is equal to the sonic speed which is mainly inﬂuenced
by the exhaust gas temperature. If a convergent nozzle is unchoked, then the jet
velocity will attain subsonic values. For a convergent divergent (CD) nozzle, the jet
speed may attain supersonic values as described in Chap. 2. CD nozzles are seen
only in supersonic aircrafts.
3.3.2
Air Speed
The air speed, sometimes denoted as the approach speed, is equal to the ﬂight speed
in the thrust force; Eq. (3.1). Such a parameter has a direct effect on the net thrust. If
the exhaust gas velocity is constant and the air velocity is increased, then the
difference between both velocities [(1 + f )ue  u] is decreased leading to a decrease
also in the net thrust. If the air mass ﬂow and the fuel to air ratio are assumed
constants, then a linear decrease in the net thrust is enhanced (Fig. 3.8).
3.3.3
Mass Air Flow
The mass air ﬂow _m a is the most signiﬁcant parameter in the thrust equation. It
depends on the air temperature and pressure as both together determine the density
of the air entering the engine. In free air, a rise in temperature will decrease the
density. Thus air density and mass ﬂow rate is inversely proportional with the air

force with air speed
3.3
Factors Affecting Thrust
175

temperature. On the contrary, an increase in the pressure of a free air increases its
density and, consequently, its thrust increases. The effect of both of air temperature
and pressure is illustrated in Fig. 3.9. In brief, the density affects the inlet air mass
ﬂow and it directly affects thrust.
3.3.4
Altitude
As outlined above, the air temperature and pressure have signiﬁcant effects on the
thrust. As described in Chap. 2, in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
temperature decreases by about 3.2 K per 500 m of altitude up to nearly 11,000 m
(36,089 ft). The variations of ambient temperature and pressure are given by
Eqs. (2.83) and (2.84). These relations are repeated here, but with altitude expressed
in meter:
T K
ð Þ ¼ 288  0:0065  z
ð3:6Þ
P
bar
ð
Þ ¼ 1:01325  0:000112  z þ 3:8e9  z
ð3:7Þ
After 11,000 m, the temperature stops falling, but the pressure continues to drop
steadily with increasing altitude. Consequently, above 11,000 m (36,089 ft), the
thrust will drop off more rapidly (Fig. 3.10). This makes the 11,000 m an optimum
altitude for long-range cruising at nominal speed, just prior to the rapidly increased
effect of altitude on thrust. It may be concluded that the effect of altitude on thrust is
really a function of density.

Performance Parameters of Jet Engines

3.3.5
Ram Effect
The movement of the aircraft relative to the outside air causes air to be rammed into
the engine inlet duct. Ram effect increases the airﬂow to the engine, which in turn,
increases the gross thrust. However, it is not as easy, ram effects combine two
factors, namely, the air speed increase and in the same time increases the pressure
of the air and the airﬂow into the engine. As described earlier, the increase of air
speed reduces the thrust, which is sketched in Fig. 3.11 as the ‘A’ curve. Moreover,
the increase of the airﬂow will increase the thrust, which is sketched by the ‘B’
curve in the same ﬁgure. The ‘C’ curve is the result of combining curves ‘A’ and
‘B’. The increase of thrust due to ram becomes signiﬁcant as the air speed increases,
which will compensate for the loss in thrust due to the reduced pressure at high
altitude. Ram effect is thus important in high speed ﬁghter aircrafts. Also modern
subsonic jet-powered aircraft ﬂy at high subsonic speeds and higher altitudes to
make use of the ram effect.

Factors Affecting Thrust
177

Finally, it is fruitful to classify the factors affecting thrust into two groups [4]:
1. Factors related to the engine
2. Factors related to the surrounding medium
The ﬁrst group [1] includes:
1. The rotational speed (rpm), which inﬂuences both of the compressor pressure
ratio and the turbine work
2. Exhaust nozzle size, which inﬂuences the jet velocity
3. Fuel ﬂow rate and turbine inlet temperature, which affect the combustor heat
generation
4. Compressor bleed ﬂow, water injection, and components performance, which
lead to increase of the speciﬁc work
The ﬁrst group thus contributes to both of the air mass ﬂow rate and jet velocity.
The second group includes:
1. Forward (air) speed, which leads to thrust decrease and more fuel consumption
2.
Air density (inﬂuenced by the ﬂight altitude, humidity, hot/cold day), which
inﬂuences the airﬂow leading to a thrust increase if the airﬂow is increased and
vice versa.
3.4
Engine Performance Parameters
The performance of an aircraft engine may be criticized by its ability to provide the
necessary thrust force needed in propelling an aircraft efﬁciently in its different
ﬂight regimes.
The engine performance parameters [1] are identiﬁed as:
1. Propulsive efﬁciency
2. Thermal efﬁciency
3. Propeller efﬁciency
4. Overall efﬁciency
5. Takeoff thrust
6. Speciﬁc fuel consumption
7. Aircraft range
Military aircrafts are powered by engines that fulﬁll its mission requirements.
For this reason, the takeoff thrust, maneuverability, and affordability are the critical
issues with some sacriﬁce of its fuel consumption in some types like ﬁghters and
interceptors. For both civil and military transports, speciﬁc fuel consumption and
the aircraft range are the critical design issues. In both types, several efﬁciencies
related to the conversion of heat generated by fuel burning into thrust force are
important.

3.4.1
Propulsive Efﬁciency
It is the efﬁciency of the conversion of the kinetic energy of air when passes through
the engine into a propulsive power. It is identiﬁed by manufacturers of aero engine
as an external efﬁciency. It is inﬂuenced by the amount of the energy wasted in the
propelling nozzle(s) and denoted by (ηp).
It is deﬁned as
ηp ¼
Thrust power
Power imparted to engine airflow
ð3:8aÞ
or simply
ηp ¼
Thrust power
Thrust power þ power wasted in the exhaust
ð3:8bÞ
which will be denoted here as the ﬁrst expression for the propulsive efﬁciency.
Another deﬁnition used in many texts is
ηp ¼
Thrust power
Rate of kinetic energy added to engine airflow
ð3:9Þ
This will be referred to as the second expression.
For ramjet, scramjet and turbojet engines, the ﬁrst expression has the form:

Considering Eqs. (3.3) and (3.12), it is important to notice that [1]:
1. If the exhaust speed is much greater than the air (ﬂight) speed, ue  u, then the
thrust force will be maximum while the propulsive efﬁciency attains a very small
value approaching zero; or as
ue
u0
 
" , then
ηp


#. This case represents takeoff
conditions (where u  0) as well as military aircrafts.
2. If the exhaust speed is nearly equal to the ﬂight speed, ue/u  1, then the thrust
force will be so small and approaches zero, while the propulsive attains very
high value approaching 100 %, or as
ue
u0
 
# then
ηp


". Thus civil transport
aircrafts require higher efﬁciency and ﬂy at lower speeds.
The highest propulsive efﬁciency is typically obtained with a propeller or an
unducted fan, as both give a relatively small impulse (Δu) to a relatively large
mass ﬂow.
For bypass engines (turbofan and propfan), the air coming into the engine is
splitted into two streams: the ﬁrst passes through the fan/propfan and is known as
the cold stream, while the other passes through the engine core, compressor,
combustion chamber, and subsequent modules, and is known as the hot stream.
Applying the same principle and employing the ﬁrst expression, we get the follow-
ing form:
ηp ¼

ð
Þ þ Wh þ Wc
ð3:13aÞ
where Th and Tc are the thrust force generated by the hot and cold streams

respectively. The thrust force and wake losses for both hot and cold streams are

by Fig. 3.12. Figure 3.13 illustrates the propulsive efﬁciency for single and contra
rotating propfan engines.
Example 3.6 A turbojet engine is powering a ﬁghter airplane. Its cruise altitude and
Mach number are 10 km and 0.85, respectively. The exhaust gases leave the nozzle
at a speed of 600 m/s and a pressure of 0.75 bar. The outlet area of exhaust nozzle is
Ae ¼ 0.24 m2. The air mass ﬂow rate is 40 kg/s and fuel to air ratio is 0.02. It is
required to calculate:
(a)
The speciﬁc thrust (T= _m a)
(b)

Solution
(a)
At altitude 10 km, the ambient temperature and pressure are

Comment
As depicted in example (3.6), the second expression for the propulsive efﬁciency
provides efﬁciencies greater than unity. Such astonishing value of a propulsive
efﬁciency greater than unity can be overcome if the effective jet velocity proposed
in [1, 6, 11] is employed. The proposed effective jet velocity is expressed as
u
0
e ¼ ue þ Pe  Pa
ð
ÞAe
_m e
ð3:16Þ
Such an effective jet velocity means that a full expansion of the gases to the ambient
pressure is assumed. In such a case, the second expression for the propulsive
efﬁciency will be exactly equal to the ﬁrst expression. This effective velocity was
also employed by Rolls Royce [5]. The effective jet velocity is identiﬁed by aero
engine manufacturers as the fully expanded jet velocity (in the exhaust plume).
Example 3.7 A comparison between turbojet, turbofan, and turboprop engines is
considered here. The three engines have the same gas generator (compressor,
combustion chamber, and turbine). It is required to calculate both the thrust and
propulsive efﬁciency of them provided the following data:

It is clear from the above example that for the same gas generator, the turboprop
engines furnishes the maximum thrust force and highest propulsive efﬁciency. The
least thrust force and minimum propulsive efﬁciency is attained by a turbojet
engine. Turbofan engine delivers a large thrust force and a high propulsive efﬁ-
ciency. It is important to mention here that the thrust of turbofan engine in many
cases much greater than turboprop engines as well be described in Chap. 4.
3.4.2
Thermal Efﬁciency
It is the efﬁciency of energy conversion within the power plant itself. So it is
considered as an internal efﬁciency, while the propulsive efﬁciency resembles an
external efﬁciency as stated earlier. Thermal efﬁciency is denoted by (ηth). Two
forms for such efﬁciency are deﬁned for the following two groups of engines.
Ramjet, scramjet, turbojet, and turbofan engines:
ηth ¼ Power imparted to engine airflow
Rate of energy supplied in the fuel ¼
_W out
_Q in
ð3:17Þ
It is easy to note that the denominator in Eq. (3.8a) is equal to the numerator in
Eq. (3.17).
For a ramjet and turbojet engines:

case, thermal efﬁciency is deﬁned as

PTotal ¼ PRotor ¼ ηrotorηgbSP
Example 3.8 Bell 206 LM helicopter is powered a single Rolls-Royce 250 C30P
turboshaft engine, Fig. 3.14, having a takeoff shaft power of 726 hp. The engine has
the following data:

Calculate the thermal efﬁciency
Solution
Since thermal efﬁciency is expressed by the relation:
ηth ¼ PTotal

where PTotal ¼ PRotor ¼ ηrotorηgbSP,
Then
PTotal ¼ PRotor ¼ ηrotorηgbSP ¼ 0:8  0:995  726 ¼ 577:9 hp

Propeller Efﬁciency
Propellers are used in both of piston and turboprop. Shaft power is converted to
thrust power. Propeller efﬁciency (ηpr) is deﬁned as the ratio between the thrust
power generated by the propeller (TP 
 uTpr) to the shaft power (SP)
ηpr ¼ TP
SP ¼ uTpr
SP
ð3:22Þ
when an appreciable amount of thrust is obtained from the exhaust gases Te in a
turboprop engine, an Equivalent Thrust Power, ETP is expressed in terms of the
shaft power, propeller efﬁciency, and exhaust thrust power, thus
ETP ¼ SP
ð
Þ  ηpr þ Teu
ð3:23aÞ
Alternatively, an equivalent shaft power (ESP) is used instead of the equivalent
thrust power. They are related to each other by the relation:
where
ESP ¼ ETP=ηpr ¼ SP þ Teu
ηpr
ð3:23bÞ
Moreover, the exhaust thrust is expressed as
Te ¼ m

The total thrust force is given by the relation:

The propeller efﬁciency is then expressed as
ηpr ¼ uT

ð3:25Þ
Such propeller efﬁciency replaces the propulsive efﬁciency of other types of aero
engines discussed above. More details will be given in Chap. 4.
3.4.4
Overall Efﬁciency
The product of the propulsive and thermal efﬁciencies (ηp  ηth) or (ηpr  ηth) as
appropriate is called the overall efﬁciency.

ð3:26Þ
Since the overall efﬁciency depends on speed (u) and the thrust (T) balances the
aircraft drag, overall efﬁciency is actually not a parameter of the engine alone, but
characterizes the engine/aircraft combination and its state of operation. The overall
efﬁciency was close to 0.2 in the 1950s, near 0.3 on average for subsonic airliner
ﬂeet in the 1990s, and may reach 0.5 for engines of 2015 [12]. The overall
efﬁciency is 0.35 for a B747 aircraft with CF6-80C2B1F engines cruising with
Mach 0.86 at 11.9 km altitude and was 0.40 for a Concorde with Olympus
593 engines cruising with Mach 2 at 16.5 km altitude, on 6400 km mission.

Since the total air mass ﬂow rate through the engine is _m a ¼ 120 kg=s and the

Takeoff Thrust
An important parameter that deﬁnes the ability of an aero engine to provide a static
and low speed thrust which enables the aircraft to take off under its own power
[1]. Both ramjet and scramjet engines are not self-accelerating propulsion systems
from static conditions: they require acceleration to an appreciable velocity by a
boost system before they are capable of providing net positive thrust. Thus they are
excluded from this discussion.
From Eq. (3.3), the static thrust of a turbojet engine with an unchoked nozzle is
expressed by the relation:
Ttakeoff ¼ m

ð3:27bÞ
For constant values ﬂow rate and thermal efﬁciency, then
Ttakeoff / 1

The above relation outlines one of the advantages of turboprop engines over
turbojet and turbofan engines. Turboprop engines accelerate a large mass ﬂow
rate of air to a small exhaust velocity which in turn increases the takeoff thrust.
Consequently, aircraft powered by turboprop engines can takeoff from a very short
runway.
3.4.6
Speciﬁc Fuel Consumption
This performance parameter of the engine has a direct inﬂuence on the costs of
aircraft trip and ﬂight economics [1]. Fuel consumption is either deﬁned per unit
thrust force (for ramjet, turbojet, and turbofan engines) or per horsepower (for
example, for turboprop and piston-propeller engines).
(A) Ramjet, turbojet and turbofan engines:
The Thrust Speciﬁc Fuel Consumption (TSFC) is deﬁned as
TSFC ¼ m

f
T
ð3:28aÞ
where the thrust force (T) is expressed by Eq. (3.1) for a ramjet/turbojet engine and
Eq. (3.4) for a turbofan engine. Values of TSFC strongly depend on the ﬂight speed,
so its typical values for both turbojet and turbofan are deﬁned for static condition.
However, for ramjet reference values for TSFC are deﬁned at ﬂight Mach number
of 2. Typical values [10] for the above mentioned three engine types are given in
Table 3.3.
Some empirical formulae are presented in [13] for thrust speciﬁc fuel consump-
tion. These formulae have the form:
TSFC ¼ a þ bM0
ð
Þ
ﬃﬃﬃ
θ
p
ð3:28bÞ
where (a) and (b) are constants that vary from one engine to another, M0 is the ﬂight
Mach number, and θ is the dimensionless ratio (Ta/Tref), which is the ratio between

the ambient temperature at the ﬂight altitude and the standard temperature at sea
level (288.2 K). For a high bypass ratio turbofan, the values of these constants are
a ¼ 0.4 and b ¼ 0.45.
(B) Turboprop engines
For engines which produce shaft power, fuel consumption is identiﬁed by Brake
Speciﬁc Fuel Consumption (BSFC), or simply SFC, and deﬁned as
SFC
BSFC ¼ m

f =SP
ð3:29Þ
When appreciable thrust is produced by the hot gases, the fuel consumption is
identiﬁed by the Equivalent Brake Speciﬁc Fuel Consumption (EBSFC), or simply
ESFC, and deﬁned by
ESFC ¼ m

f =ESP
ð3:30Þ

. The values
of the corresponding constants in the empirical relation (3.25b) are a ¼ 0.2 and

250 m/s at an altitude where the ambient pressure is 20 kPa. A convergent nozzle is

Aircraft Range
Aircraft range is a design parameter of the aircraft and based on which the number,
location, and capacity of fuel tanks in the aircraft is determined [1]. The aircraft
weight is composed of the structural weight, the pay load (including the crew
members, food, and service supply), and the fuel weight. During any trip, only
the fuel weight is changeable.
Now consider the cruise phase in a ﬂight trip where the aircraft ﬂies at a constant
speed. Ignoring the climb and descent phases, it may be assumed that the cruise
distance is equal to the trip distance of the aircraft. During cruise, the aircraft is
subjected to two vertical forces [lift (L) and weight (mg), which are equal in
magnitude] and two horizontal forces [thrust (T) and drag (D), which are also
equal in magnitude], refer to Fig. 3.18.
Then
T ¼ D ¼ mg D=L
ð

where (m) is the instantaneous aircraft mass and (g) is the gravitational acceleration.
Thus
T

mg ¼ 1

aircraft, then

Performance Parameters of Jet Engines

In the above Eqs. (3.32) and (3.33), the ratio between the lift and drag forces may be
alternatively written as CL
CD, where the lift force coefﬁcient is calculated as usual
from the relation:
CL ¼
W
1
2 ρU2SW
where W and SW are the aircraft weight and wing area.
The drag coefﬁcient is calculated from the relation:
CD ¼ K1CL
2 þ K2CL þ CDo
where the constants K1, K2, and CDo are typical function of the ﬂight Mach number
and wing conﬁguration (ﬂap position, etc.). The CDo term is the zero lift drag
coefﬁcient, which accounts for both frictional and pressure drag in the subsonic
ﬂight and wave drag in supersonic ﬂight [13]. The K1 and K2 terms account for the
drag due to lift. Normally, K2 is very small and approximately equal to zero in most
ﬁghter aircrafts.
It is clear from Eqs. (3.32) and (3.31) that to maximize the range of an aircraft
ﬂying at a speciﬁed speed [14]:
1. Fly at the maximum lift to drag ratio
2. Have the highest possible overall efﬁciency
3. Have the lowest speciﬁc fuel consumption
4. Have the highest possible ratio between the aircraft weights at the start and end
of cruise

If the time spent in the air is of interest and not the distance traveled then one is
concerned with endurance. Endurance is the longest time an aircraft can spend in
ﬂight without landing. The maximum endurance of an aircraft (or the time aloft)
refers to a ﬂight condition that requires the minimum fuel power.
The minimum fuel consumption as seen from Eq. (3.39) for a time ﬂight time (t)
occurs, when the endurance factor is maximum.

Mission Segment Weight Fraction
For analysis, the various mission segments, or “legs”, are numbered, with
(1) denoting the start of the mission. Mission leg “one” is usually engine warmup
and takeoff. The remaining legs are sequentially numbered [17]. The simple
mission for a passenger aircraft the mission legs are: (1) warmup and takeoff,
(2) climb, (3) cruise, (4) loiter, and (5) land (Fig. 3.19). Table 3.8 gives typical
weight-fractions for mission legs [17].

3.4.11
Head- and Tail-Wind
When an aircraft is in ﬂight, it is moving relative to the body of air through which it
is ﬂying; therefore maintaining an accurate ground track is not easy unless there is
no wind at all which is a very rare occurrence. The pilot must adjust heading to

compensate for the wind, in order to follow the ground track. Initially the pilot will
calculate headings to ﬂy for each leg of the trip prior to departure, using the forecast
wind directions and speeds supplied by the meteorological authorities for the purpose.
These ﬁgures are generally accurate and updated several times per day, but the
unpredictable nature of the weather means that the pilot must be prepared to make
further adjustments in ﬂight. A general aviation (GA) pilot will often make use of
either the E6B ﬂight computer – a type of slide rule – or a purpose-designed electronic
navigational computer to calculate initial headings. As will be explained in example
(3.12), the ﬂight time will depend on both the desired cruising speed of the aircraft and
the wind – a tailwind will shorten ﬂight times, a headwind will increase them.

3.4.12
Route Planning
Pilot planning a ﬂight under VFR (Visual ﬂight rules) will usually use an aeronau-
tical chart of the area published for the use of pilots. This map will depict controlled
airspace, radio navigation aids, and airﬁelds prominently, as well as hazards to
ﬂying such as mountains, etc. It also includes sufﬁcient ground detail – towns,
roads, wooded areas – to aid visual navigation.
The pilot will choose a route, taking care to avoid controlled airspace that is not
permitted for the ﬂight, restricted areas, danger areas, and so on. The chosen route is
plotted on the map, and the lines drawn are called the track. During ﬂight planning,
two points must be taken into consideration:
Point of no return
Critical point
These points will be discussed hereafter.
3.4
Engine Performance Parameters
209

3.4.12.1
Point of No Return
The Point of no Return (PNR) is also known as the Point of Safe Return (PSR). This
is the furthest point along track that a pilot can ﬂy towards the destination and have
sufﬁcient fuel to divert to an alternate, with safe reserves on arrival. In other words,
it is pilot’s last chance to assess his/her prospect of a successful approach and
landing at his destination and decide whether to go on or to divert. If any doubt
exists, he/she must divert to the alternate.
There are a number of methods which can be used to calculate a PNR/PSR, but
the one most favored uses what are called Speciﬁc Fuel Flows (SFF).
These are calculated by dividing the planned cruise fuel ﬂow by the expected
ground speeds towards the destination and towards the alternate ﬁeld. Normally,
two cases may be expected:
1. When the alternate is the departure ﬁeld
2. Alternate is on track between the departure point and the destination
Two examples will be given below to illustrate both cases.
Example 3.13 Consider a ﬂight from airport A to airport B, with A as the alternate
ﬁeld (Fig. 3.21). The distance A to B is 2700 nms. Maximum range cruise power
will be used, giving a fuel ﬂow (FF) of 800 l/h. The aircraft can carry 8000 l of
useable fuel without exceeding the Maximum AUW (All Up Weight (Gross)). The
Fixed Reserve is 1400 l. The used fuel for taxi and the climb are 100 and 500 l,
respectively. A 15 % of fuel is next maintained to provide a Variable Reserve. At
this power setting, the planned TAS (true airspeed) is 500 kts and a 50 kts tailwind
is forecast A to B. Calculate the distance of point of no return (PNR) from the
departure airport A.
Solution
The ground speed from A to B is
VAB ¼ V0 þ V1 ¼ 550 kts
Fig. 3.21 Flight track with departure airport as an alternate
210
3
Performance Parameters of Jet Engines

For a return to A, the ground speed is
VBA ¼ V0  V1 ¼ 450 kts
Maximum range cruise power will be used, giving a fuel ﬂow (FF) of 800 l/h, and
this fuel ﬂow will also be used for a Fixed Reserve and any holding.
To establish the Flight Fuel Available for the PNR calculation, we must subtract
from the Useable Fuel the Fixed Reserve (1400 l), the taxi fuel (100 l), and the
climb allowance (500 l). The forecast for a possible return to A does not indicate the
need for any holding fuel. Therefore, the Flight Fuel Available (FFA) is
FFA ¼ 8000  1400 þ 100 þ 500
ð
Þ ¼ 6000 l
This ﬁgure is now divided by 1.15 to provide a Variable Reserve, giving a ﬁnal FFA
of 5217 l.
Assume that L is the distance from airport A to PNR, and fuel consumption as:
Q1 ¼ Fuel quantity consumed in the root from A to PNR
Q2 ¼ Fuel quantity consumed in the root from PNR to A

The PNR is 1614 nms apart from departure airport and 1086 nms apart from
arrival airport.
Example 3.14 We will use the previous example of a ﬂight from A to B over a
distance of 2700 nms, but with the possible alternate (C) located at 700 nms along
track towards A, i.e., the distance from C to B is 2000 nms. The other planning data
remains the same as in the previous example, i.e.:
(a)
Flight Fuel Available at A ¼ 5217 l (after allowing for a Variable Reserve)
(b)
Cruise Fuel Flow ¼ 800 l/h
(c)
Ground Speed away from home ¼ 550 kts
(d)
Ground Speed back to home ¼ 450 kts
Calculate the distance between departure airport (A) and PNR.
3.4
Engine Performance Parameters
211

Solution
We ﬁrst determine how much fuel is required to ﬂy from A to overhead C. This is
equal to the distance A to C (700 nms) divided by the speed (550 kts) and multiplied
by the cruise fuel consumption (800 l/h).
Q ¼ Fuel quantity consumed in the root from A to C
Q ¼ FF  T ¼ 800T ¼ 800700
550 ¼ 1, 018 l
Fuel available to the trip from C to PNR and PNR to C is then
Q
0 ¼ 5217  1, 018 ¼ 4199 l
The distance to PNR is L, given by the relation:
L ¼ Q

ð
Þ
2V0  FF
¼ 4199 
450  550
2  500  800 ¼ 1299 nms
The distance of the PNR from C is therefore 1299 nms. This is 701 nms short of B
and 1999 nms away from A. If the aircraft ﬂies beyond this point, there will not be
sufﬁcient fuel to return to C with the ﬁxed reserve intact (Fig. 3.22).
3.4.12.2
Critical Point
Similarly, the Equal Time Point, referred to as the ETP (also Critical point (CP)), is
the point in the ﬂight where it would take the same time to continue ﬂying straight,
or track back to the departure aerodrome. The ETP is not dependant on fuel, but
wind, giving a change in ground speed out from, and back to the departure
aerodrome. In Nil wind conditions, the ETP is located halfway between the two
aerodromes, but in reality it is shifted depending on the wind speed and direction.
While the distance to a PNR is dependent on fuel availability and fuel ﬂow, the
distance to a Critical Point (CP) is independent of fuel considerations and is based
on groundspeeds only.

Performance Parameters of Jet Engines

As an illustration, we will calculate a CP/ETP for the previous example ﬂight.
Example 3.15 Consider a ﬂight from airport A to airport B. The distance A to B is
2700 nms. At this power setting, the planned TAS (true airspeed) is 500 kts and a
50 kts tailwind is forecast A to B. Calculate the critical point (CP) from the
departure airport A (Fig. 3.23).
The ground speed from CP to B is (VAB ¼ V0 + V1 ¼ 550 kts), while the ground
speed for a return to A is (VBA ¼ V0  V1 ¼ 450 kts).
T1 ¼ Flight time from critical point to departure airport A

is also 2.7 h (1215/450).

Introduction
Air-breathing engines are named so because they need only air for combustion
while carrying appropriate fuels. Consequently, these propulsion systems stop
working outside the atmosphere.
Aircraft designers endeavor is to achieve higher power (or thrust) and less
weight (using advanced composite material). Thus achieve high thrust-to-weight
ratio. Other goals are smaller frontal area, reduced emission (CO2, SOx, and NOx),
small noise footprint, better cooling characteristics, and lower fuel consumption
[1]. Moreover, during production, it is recommended to be built with green pro-
cesses and material.
The main target of this chapter and the succeeding three ones (5–7) is to provide
aerodynamics and thermodynamics details of different aero engines powering all
types of aircrafts discussed in Chap. 1 as illustrated by Fig. 1.56, which is
reproduced again here as Fig. 4.1. We are concerned in these four chapters with
internal combustion engines rather than external combustion engines. Internal
combustion engines have two broad categories, namely, shaft and reaction engines.
Shaft engines are categorized as two groups, namely:
•
Intermittent types
•
Continuous types
This chapter handles only intermittent combustion engines, namely, reciprocat-
ing and rotary types. Continuous combustion engines identiﬁed as turbine shaft
engines are categorized as turboprop, turboshaft, and propfan engines, which will
be handled in Chap. 7. The other main group of internal combustion is the reaction
engines. This engine group is either of the Ram Based Cycles (RBC) (also identiﬁed
as athodyd, which stands for Aero THermODYnamic Duct) or Turbine Based Cycle
(TBC) Engines. Athodyd group (or RBC) includes ramjet, pulsejet, scramjet, and
dual combustion ramjet engines, which will be treated in Chap. 5 [1]. Turbine based

engines (or TBC) include turbojet, turbofan, turbo ramjet, turbo rocket, and
advanced ducted fan engines, which will be handled in Chap. 6.
All of these engines must fulﬁll the following basic requirements:
1. Efﬁciency: the engine must operate at high efﬁciency under a wide range of
atmospheric conditions
2. Economy: the engine must be economic to produce, run, and maintain
3. Reliability: the engine must be able to endure long periods of operation at high
power settings without failure
A question arises here is: Why are there different types of engines? The short
answer is that each engine is designed to fulﬁll the mission requirements of

aerospace vehicle to which it installed. Airliners and cargo planes spend most of
their ﬂight operation in a cruise condition. For these airplanes, thrust is not as
important as high engine efﬁciency and low fuel consumption. Since thrust depends
on both the amount of air/gas moved and its velocity, we can generate high thrust by
accelerating a large mass of air/gas by a small amount (propeller coupled to either
piston or turboprop engines as well as single/double propfan engines), or by
accelerating a small mass of air/gas by a large amount (RBC based and TBC
engines). Because of the high aerodynamic efﬁciency of propellers and fans, it is
more fuel efﬁcient to accelerate a large mass of air by a small amount. That is why
we ﬁnd high bypass turbofans and turboprops on cargo planes and airliners.
Most ﬁghter planes or experimental high speed aircrafts require very high excess
thrust to accelerate quickly and to overcome the high drag associated with high speeds.
For these airplanes, engine efﬁciency is not as important as very high thrust. Modern
military aircraft typically employ afterburners on a low bypass turbofan engines. Future
hypersonic aircraft will employ some type of ramjet/scramjet or rocket propulsion.
Since thrust force is dependent on jet speed, the higher jet speed is the higher
thrust and ﬂight speed of aerospace vehicles. Table 4.1 presents the jet velocity for
different aerospace vehicles.
4.2
Intermittent (or Piston) Engines
As illustrated in Fig. 4.1, intermittent combustion (or piston) engines are one of the
shaft engines. It is sometimes identiﬁed as Aero Piston Engines to differentiate it
from automotive piston engines. Aero piston engines are classiﬁed into three types:

namely:

reciprocating
engines. The Wright Flyer that started the era of powered ﬂight in 1903 was
powered by a simple four-cylinder piston engine. Aero piston engines were the
primary power plant during the ﬁrst 50 years of ﬂight. Aero piston engines may
power small aircrafts and helicopters. Small airplanes have one or more piston-
powered engines connected to the propeller(s), which provide thrust to move the
aircraft on the ground and through the air. Piston-powered aircrafts/helicopters
most commonly use 100 octane low-leaded fuel. Table 4.2 provides astonishing
statistics for present and forecast of piston and jet engines in the period 2000–2032.
Aircraft powered by jet engines are nearly 10 % of those powered by piston engines
in year 2000. However, this ratio is expected to increase to 27.8 % by year 2032.
The number of aircraft powered by piston engines drops by 10 % in the interval
2000–2032, while the number of aircrafts powered by jet engines increases by
195 % in the same period. Many of the piston aircraft used for business typically ﬂy
relatively short missions of 300–400 miles, at altitudes below 15,000 ft, using very
small general aviation airports that are often without air trafﬁc control towers.
Helicopters are often attractive to business people because of their ability to land at
a variety of heliports and outlying airports. Manufacturers of piston-driven air-
planes include the following companies: Cirrus, Cessna, Hawker Beechcraft, Dia-
mond, and Mooney. Manufacturers of helicopters include the following companies:
Agusta Westland, Bell, Enstrom Helicopter, Eurocopter, Robinson, and Sikorsky.
Piston engines are sources of power in land, sea, and air applications. They are
the only source for nearly all automotives. Very few cars in present days use
electrical and/or solar powers. Most locomotives use piston engines. Most maritime
applications also use piston engines. In aviation ﬁeld also, most small aircrafts
(whether in capacity or range) are powered by piston engines. However, for both
maritime and aviation applications, piston engines cannot propel these vehicle by its
own. Piston engines must by coupled to propellers. Marine propellers sometimes
called marine screws were invented and employed far before air propellers or air
screws. Wright brothers had also designed, tested (in their wind tunnel), and

Piston Engines and Propellers

manufactured the ﬁrst air propeller in their Flyer I (or 1903 Flyer). Their lightweight
four stroke piston engine powered the twin propellers via a sprocket chain drive.
For this reason, this chapter is divided into two parts: the ﬁrst one handles aero-
piston engines and the second part treats propellers. In both parts, aerodynamics and
available power are the main topics.
4.2.1
Milestones
Since 1903 and up to the ﬁrst jet engines invented by Sir Frank Whittle and Dr. von
Ohain, piston engines were the only prime mover for ﬂight vehicles. Later on jet
engines took over and became the dominant prime mover or power plants employed
in propelling aircrafts. Appendix A provides a short list for piston engines
employed in aviation ﬁeld, starting from Wrights Brothers.
4.2.2
Types of Aero Piston Engines
Aero piston engines as described earlier are further classiﬁed into the following
three types:
•
Rotary engines
•
Reciprocating engines
•
Supercharged/turbocharged reciprocating engines
Piston engines are further classiﬁed based on number of cylinders, method of
cooling, and cylinders’ arrangements. Regarding cooling, most aircraft engines are
air-cooled. However, a few liquid-cooled engines are in operation. In both cases,
excess air is transferred to the surrounding air. In air cooled, heat is transferred
directly to the surrounding air. A liquid cooled engine transfer heat from the
cylinders to a liquid coolant which in turn transfers the heat to the surrounding air
through the radiator.
Two principal types of piston engines are:
•
Spark ignition engine (SI), which is also identiﬁed as petrol engine or gasoline
engine
•
Compression-ignition engine (CI), which is also identiﬁed as diesel engine
Moreover, piston engines may be speciﬁed as:
•
Two-stroke engines
•
Four-stroke engines
In a spark-ignition engine, a mixture of fuel and air is ignited by a spark plug. In
most petrol engines, the fuel and air are usually pre-mixed before compression. The
pre-mixing was formerly done in a carburetor, but now it is done by electronically
controlled fuel injection, except in small engines. Spark-ignition engines are
4.2
Intermittent (or Piston) Engines
223

advantageous for applications requiring small power (up to about 225 kW; 300 horse-
power). In a compression-ignition engine, air is compressed to a high enough
pressure and temperature that combustion occurs spontaneously when fuel is injected.
Petrol engines run at higher speeds than diesels, partially due to their lighter pistons,
connecting rods and crankshaft and due to petrol burning faster than diesel. However,
the lower compression ratios of a petrol engine give a lower efﬁciency than a diesel
engine. Compression-ignition engines are more reliable and normally preferred for
applications when fuel economy and relatively large amounts of power are required.
New diesel engines may bring fuel efﬁciency and lead-free emissions to small
aircraft, representing the biggest change in light aircraft engines in decades. The
diesel engine has the highest thermal efﬁciency of any regular internal or external
combustion engine due to its very high compression ratio. In the middle range, spark
ignition and compression-ignition engines are used.
4.2.2.1
Rotary Engines
(A) Conventional types
The rotary engine was an early type of internal-combustion engine, usually
designed with an odd number of cylinders per row in a radial conﬁguration. In
rotary engines, the crankshaft remained stationary and the entire cylinder block
rotated around it. This type of engine was widely used during World War I and the
years immediately preceding that conﬂict. They have been described as very
efﬁcient in terms of power output, weight, cost, manufacture, and reliability.
The rotary engine met these goals with Gnome Omega No. 1 Rotary Engine;
Fig. 4.2 as an example. The entire engine rotates with the propeller, providing
plenty of airﬂow for cooling regardless of the aircraft’s forward speed. Some of
Fig. 4.2 Rotary engine (Gnome engine)

Piston Engines and Propellers

these engines were a two-stroke design, giving them a high speciﬁc power and
power-to-weight ratio. Unfortunately, the severe gyroscopic effects from the heavy
rotating engine made the aircraft very difﬁcult to ﬂy. The engines also consumed
large amounts of castor oil, spreading it all over the airframe and creating fumes
which were nauseating to the pilots. Engine designers had always been aware of the
many limitations of the rotary engine.
(B) Wankel Engines
The Wankel engine is a type of internal combustion engine using an eccentric
rotary design to convert pressure into a rotating motion instead of using recipro-
cating pistons (Fig. 4.3a). Its four-stroke cycle (Fig. 4.3b) takes place in a space
between the inside of an oval-like epitrochoid-shaped housing and a rotor that is
similar in shape to a Reuleaux triangle but with sides that are somewhat ﬂatter. The
very compact Wankel engine delivers smooth high-rpm power. It also has high
horsepower per displacement compared to other internal combustion engines. The
lubrication system is similar to that of the two-stroke engine, and thus it does not
need a separate system like the four-stroke engine.
Wankel engine is considered optimum power plant for light aircraft, as it is light,
compact, and almost vibrationless and has a high power-to-weight ratio. Further
aviation beneﬁts of a Wankel engine include:
(i) Rotors cannot seize, since rotor casings expand more than rotors
(ii) Not susceptible to “shock-cooling” during descent
(iii) Does not require an enriched mixture for cooling at high power
The ﬁrst Wankel rotary-engine aircraft was the experimental Lockheed Q-Star
civilian version of the United States Army’s reconnaissance QT-2 in 1967. It was
later on installed in a variety of aircrafts including Diamond DA20, general aviation
aircraft designed for ﬂight training. Moreover, Wankels due to their compact size
and quiet operation are used in drones or UAVs (as an example, AAI RQ-7
Shadow) (Fig. 4.4).
Wankel engines are also becoming increasingly popular in homebuilt experi-
mental aircraft, such as the light aircraft ARV Super2 powered by liquid cooled
MidWest AE110 twin-rotor Wankel engine (Fig. 4.5).

Piston Engines and Propellers

Since Wankel engines operate at a relatively high rotational speed with rela-
tively low torque, propeller aircraft must use a Propeller Speed Reduction Unit
(PSRU) to keep their propellers within the proper speed range. For instance, the
MidWest twin-rotor engine (Fig. 4.5) has a 2.95:1 reduction gearbox.
Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne developed a diesel Wankel engine for use in a
prototype VTOL ﬂying car called the “Transformer”. The engine based on an
earlier UAV diesel Wankel concept called “EnduroCORE”.
4.2.2.2
Reciprocating Engines
Based on cylinder arrangements, we have the following types:
•
Inline engine
•
Horizontally opposed engine
•
V-type engine
•
X-type Engine
•
H-type Engine
•
Radial type engine
(a)
In-line Engines
This type of engine has cylinders lined up in one row. Mostly, it has an even
number of cylinders (Fig. 4.6). Many in-line engines were developed during World
War I (WWI), like Hispano-Suiza engine and Benz BZ-4. The biggest advantage of
an inline engine is that it allows the aircraft to be designed with a narrow frontal
area for low drag. The cylinders are either upright above the crankshaft or inverted,
that is, below the crankshaft. An example for inverted inline engine is Menasco
Pirate, model C-4. Inverted inline engine allows the propeller to be mounted up
high for ground clearance and good visibility for pilots. The disadvantages of an
inline engine include a poor power-to-weight ratio, because the crankcase and
Fig. 4.5 ARV Super2 homebuilt experimental aircraft
4.2
Intermittent (or Piston) Engines
227

crankshaft are long and thus heavy. An in-line engine may be either air-cooled or
liquid-cooled, but liquid-cooling is more common because it is difﬁcult to get
enough air-ﬂow to cool the rear cylinders directly. Inline engines were common
in early aircraft, including the Wright Flyer. However, the inherent disadvantages
of the design soon became apparent, and the inline design was abandoned, becom-
ing a rarity in modern aviation.
(b) Horizontally Opposed Engines
A horizontally opposed engine, also called a ﬂat or boxer engine, has two banks
of cylinders on opposite sides of a centrally located crankcase. The engine is either
air-cooled or liquid-cooled, but air-cooled versions predominate. Opposed engines
are mounted with the crankshaft horizontal in airplanes, but may be mounted with
the crankshaft vertical in helicopters. Engine is streamlined resulting in less drag
and good visibility for pilots. Due to the cylinder layout, reciprocating forces tend
to cancel, resulting in a smooth running engine. Opposed, air-cooled four- and
six-cylinder piston engines are by far the most common engines used in small
general aviation aircraft requiring up to 400 horsepower (300 kW) per engine.
Continental O-360 is an example for horizontally opposed engine.
(c) V-type Engines
Cylinders in this engine are arranged in two in-line banks, tilted 30–90 apart
from each other. The vast majority of V engines are water-cooled. The V design
provides a higher power-to-weight ratio than an inline engine, while still providing
a small frontal area. Perhaps the most famous example of this design is the
legendary Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, a 27-l 60 V12 engine used in, among others,
Fig. 4.6 Four-cylinder straight engine scheme
228

Piston Engines and Propellers

the Spitﬁres. Similarly two types of V-engines, namely, upright V-type and inverted
V-type, are frequently seen in WWI engines.
(d) X-type Engines
X engine comprises twinned V-block engines horizontally opposed to each
other. Thus, the cylinders are arranged in four banks, driving a common crankshaft.
Rolls-Royce Vulture is an example of this type, which powered Avro Manchester
bomber and the Hawker Tornado ﬁghter.
(e) H-Type Engine
An H engine (or H-block) is an engine conﬁguration in which the cylinders are
aligned so that if viewed from the front they appear to be in a vertical or horizontal
letter H. An H engine can be viewed as two ﬂat engines, one atop or beside the
other. The “two engines” each have their own crankshaft, which are then geared
together at one end for power-take-off.
Napier Sabre was a British H-24-cylinder, liquid cooled, piston aero engine,
built by Napier & Son during World War II, which powered the Hawker Typhoon
aircraft, in mid-1941.
(f) Radial Type Engine
This type of engine has one or two rows of cylinders arranged in a circle around a
centrally located crankcase (Fig. 4.7). Each row must have an odd number of
cylinders in order to produce smooth operation. Rotary and radial engines look
strikingly similar when they are not running and can easily be confused, since both
have cylinders arranged radially around a central crankshaft. Unlike the rotary
Fig. 4.7 Single-row radial
type engine
4.2
Intermittent (or Piston) Engines
229

engine, however, radial engines use a conventional rotating crankshaft in a ﬁxed
engine block. A radial engine has only one crank throw per row and a relatively
small crankcase, resulting in a favorable power-to-weight ratio. Because the cylin-
der arrangement exposes a large amount of the engine’s heat-radiating surfaces to
the air and tends to cancel reciprocating forces, radials tend to cool evenly and run
smoothly. The lower cylinders, which are under the crankcase, may collect oil when
the engine has been stopped for an extended period with a possible hydrostatic lock.
In military aircraft designs, the large frontal area of the engine acted as an extra
layer of armor for the pilot. However, the large frontal area also resulted in an
aircraft with a blunt and aerodynamically inefﬁcient proﬁle.
4.2.2.3
Supercharging and Turbocharging Engines
Superchargers and turbochargers are two types of forced induction employed in
piston engines to add large amounts of power to their motor. In aviation ﬁelds,
supercharging and turbocharging allows piston engines to develop maximum power
when operating at high altitudes or boost its power during takeoff. At high altitudes,
an un-supercharged engine will lose power because of the reduced density of air
entering the induction system of engine. Both superchargers (Fig. 4.8) and turbo-
chargers (Fig. 4.9) have compressors mounted in the intake system and used to raise
the pressure and density of the incoming air. The advantage of compressing the air
is that it lets the engine stuff more air into a cylinder. More air means that more fuel
can be stuffed in too, so more power is obtained from each explosion in each
cylinder. The typical boost provided by either a turbocharger or a supercharger is
20–50 kPa. Two types of compressors are used in superchargers and turbochargers.
These are either positive displacement or dynamic. Three types of positive dis-
placement compressors are extensively used, namely, the roots, vane, and screw
Compressor

compressor. Two types of dynamic compressors are used, either centrifugal or
axial. This power can be supplied by a separate drive for the supercharger or by
connecting the supercharger directly to the engine shaft or to gas turbine driven by
the engine exhaust gases. As shown in Fig. 4.9, turbochargers consist of a centrif-
ugal compressor coupled to a radial inﬂow turbine through either vaneless or vaned
diffuser housing.
The key difference between a turbocharger and a supercharger is its power
supply. Superchargers are mechanically driven directly off the engine through
belts, gears, shafts, or chains connected to the engine’s crankshaft. It is normally
located between the carburetor and inlet manifold. A turbocharger, on the other
hand, is powered by a turbine mounted in the exhaust stream, which in turn spins
the compressor element situated between the air-intake and the carburetor or
injector [2].
There are tradeoffs in both systems. In theory, a turbocharger is more efﬁcient
because it is using the “wasted” energy in the exhaust stream for its power source.
On the other hand, a turbocharger causes some amount of back pressure in the
exhaust system and tends to provide less boost until the engine is running at higher
RPMs. Generally, turbocharging is commonly found on high power four-stroke
engines, but it can also be used on two-stroke engines. Superchargers are easier to
install but tend to be more expensive. A supercharger is a lot safer because of the
simplicity of its design.
Super/turbo-chargers are used in the following aircrafts: Spitﬁre Mark I, Hurri-
cane Mark I, Deﬁant ﬁghter, Wellington bomber, Halifax bomber, Lancaster
bomber, and Mosquito ﬁghter (Table 4.3).

Terminology for Four-Stroke Engine
Figure 4.10 is a sketch of a reciprocating internal combustion engine consisting of a
piston that moves within a cylinder ﬁtted with two valves. The sketch is labeled
with some special terms. The bore of the cylinder is its diameter. The stroke is the
distance the piston moves in one direction. The piston is said to be at top dead center
(TDC) when it has moved to a position where the cylinder volume is a minimum
[3]. This minimum volume is known as the clearance volume. When the piston has
moved to the position of maximum cylinder volume, the piston is at bottom dead
center (BDC). The distance between the TDC and the BDC is the largest distance
that the piston can travel in one direction, and it is called the stroke of the engine.
The volume swept out by the piston as it moves from the top dead center to the
bottom dead center position is called the displacement volume. The reciprocating
motion of the piston is converted to rotary motion by a crank mechanism.
The compression ratio (rc) is deﬁned as the volume at bottom dead center
(maximum volume) divided by the volume at top dead center (minimum volume
or clearance).
rc ¼ Vmax
Vmin
¼ VBDC
VTDC
ð4:1Þ
Notice that the compression ratio is a volume ratio and should not be confused with
the pressure ratio [4].
In a four-stroke internal combustion engine, the piston executes four distinct
strokes within the cylinder for every two revolutions of the crankshaft. Figure 4.11
gives a pressure–volume diagram such as might be displayed electronically.
1. With the intake valve open, the piston makes an intake stroke to draw a fresh
charge into the cylinder. For spark-ignition engines, the charge is a combustible
mixture of fuel and air. Air alone is the charge in compression-ignition engines.

2. With both valves closed, the piston undergoes a compression stroke, raising the
temperature and pressure of the charge. This requires work input from the piston
to the cylinder contents. Combustion is induced near the end of the compression
stroke in spark-ignition engines by the spark plug. In compression ignition
engines, combustion is initiated by injecting fuel into the hot compressed air,
beginning near the end of the compression stroke and continuing through the ﬁrst
part of the expansion. Combustion process results in a high-pressure, high-
temperature gas mixture.
3. A power stroke follows the compression stroke, during which the gas mixture
expands and work is done on the piston as it returns to bottom dead center.
4. The piston then executes an exhaust stroke in which the burned gases are purged
from the cylinder through the open exhaust valve.
4.3.2
Air-Standard Analysis
The analysis of real ﬂow within internal combustion engine is very complex due to
mechanical and thermal losses associated with friction and combustion process.
Other complexities are associated with heat transfer between the gases and the
cylinder walls as well as the work required to charge the cylinder and exhaust the
products of combustion. Accurate modeling of reciprocating internal combustion
engines normally involves computer simulation. To conduct elementary thermody-
namic analyses of internal combustion engines, considerable simpliﬁcation is

required. One procedure is to employ an air-standard analysis having the following
elements:
1.
The almost-constant pressure intake and exhaust strokes are assumed to be
constant pressure. At WOT (Wide-Open Throttle or fully open throttle valve),
the intake stroke is assumed to be at a pressure of one atmosphere. At partially
closed throttle or when supercharged, inlet pressure will assume a constant
value other than one atmosphere [5]. The exhaust stroke pressure is assumed
constant at one atmosphere.
2. All processes are internally reversible.

Piston Engines and Propellers

3. Compression and expansion strokes are approximated by isentropic processes
(reversible and adiabatic). Lubrication minimizes the friction between piston
and cylinder walls. Heat transfer for any stroke is negligibly small due to its
very short time.
4. The combustion process is replaced by a heat addition process from an external
source at constant-volume process (Spark-Ignition: SI cycle), a constant-
pressure process (Compression-Ignition: CI cycle), or a combination of both
(Dual cycle)
5. Exhaust blow-down is approximated by a constant-volume process.
In air-standard cycles, air is considered an ideal gas such that the following ideal

Engine Cycles
Two cycles will be discussed here. These are Otto and diesel cycles. Otto cycle is
the ideal cycle for spark-ignition engines, while diesel cycle is the ideal cycle for
compression-ignition cycles.
Speciﬁc heats of air are functions of temperature. Temperature within piston
engines may vary from room temperature up to several thousands. At the
low-temperature of the cycle (during intake and start of compression), speciﬁc
heat ratio has a value of γ ¼ 1:4, while at the end of combustion, due to temperature
rise, speciﬁc heat ratio will be γ ¼ 1:3: To simplify cycle analysis, speciﬁc heat will
be assumed constant having the average value of γ ¼ 1:35:

Thermodynamic Analysis of Air-Standard Otto Cycle at WOT
The Otto cycle is the ideal cycle for spark-ignition reciprocating engines. It is
named after Nikolaus A. Otto, who built in 1876 a successful four-stroke engine in
Germany. In most spark-ignition engines, the piston executes four complete strokes
(two mechanical cycles) within the cylinder, and the crankshaft completes two
revolutions for each thermodynamic cycle. These engines are called four-stroke
internal combustion engines. A schematic drawing for the ideal cycle drawn on
both P-v and T-s diagrams are shown in Fig. 4.12.

From Eq. (4.14b), thermal efﬁciency is dependent of both of the compression ratio
(rc) and speciﬁc heat ratio (γ). A plot of Otto thermal efﬁciency versus the
compression ratio for different values of (γ) is given in Fig. 4.13.
From Fig. 4.13, it is noticed that:
1. The thermal efﬁciency curve is rather steep at low compression ratios but ﬂattens
out starting with a compression ratio value of about 8. Therefore, the increase in
thermal efﬁciency with the compression ratio is not as pronounced at high
compression ratios.
2. For a given compression ratio, an ideal Otto cycle using a monatomic gas (such
as argon or helium, γ ¼ 1.667) as the working ﬂuid will have the highest thermal
efﬁciency. The least speciﬁc heat ratio (γ ¼ 1.3) provides the smallest Otto
thermal efﬁciency.
General Remarks
1. The working ﬂuid in actual engines contains larger molecules such as carbon
dioxide, and the speciﬁc heat ratio decreases with temperature, which is one of

the reasons that the actual cycles have lower thermal efﬁciencies than the ideal
Otto cycle.
2. For a given compression ratio, the thermal efﬁciency of an actual spark-ignition
engine is less than that of an ideal Otto cycle because of the irreversibilities, such
as friction, and other factors such as incomplete combustion.
3. The thermal efﬁciencies of actual spark-ignition engines range from about 25 to
30 %.
Power generation and fuel consumption
The torque generated in piston engines is normally measured with a dynamom-
eter. The engine is clamped on a test bed and the shaft is connected to the
dynamometer rotor. The rotor is coupled to a stator either electromagnetically,
hydraulically or by mechanical friction. The stator is balanced with the rotor
stationary. The torque exerted by the engine T is:
T ¼ F b

A parameter used to describe the performance of reciprocating piston engines is
the mean effective pressure (MEP); Eq. (4.43). The mean effective pressure is a
ﬁctitious pressure that, if it acted on the piston during the entire power stroke, would
produce the same amount of network as that produced during the actual cycle

Volumetric Efﬁciency (ηV)
Volumetric efﬁciency is only used with four-stroke cycle engines which have a
distinct induction process. It is a measure for the effectiveness of engine’s induction
process, as the intake system (air ﬁlter, carburetor, intake manifold, and intake
valve) restricts the amount of air induced to the engine [6]. It is deﬁned as the
volume ﬂow rate of air into the intake system divided by the rate at which volume is

Propulsive Efﬁciency
Piston engine is coupled to propeller(s) to furnish the forwarding thrust force.
The propulsive efﬁciency here is a propeller efﬁciency which is the ratio of thrust
horsepower to the brake horsepower. In average, ηP 
 ηPr ¼ 80 %.
Thus thrust horsepower constitutes approximately 80 % of the bhp, while the
other 20 % is lost in friction and slippage controlling the blade angle of the

Two-Stroke Spark Ignition (Otto Cycle) Engines
Two stroke engines are small engines that may be used in ultra-light aircrafts.
Similar to four stroke engines, two-stroke engine is constructed with a cylinder,
piston, crankshaft, connecting rod, and crankcase.

Petrol engine includes a spark plug, while diesel engine replaces the spark plug
with fuel injector (Fig. 4.18). The cycle is illustrated in Fig. 4.19 and described as
follows:
A fresh charge of fuel-air mixture enters when the piston uncovers the intake
port while moving upwards (Fig. (4.19)). There is already a fuel-air mixture being
compressed in the cylinder head above the piston. At the top of the compression
stroke, the compressed fuel-air mixture is ignited by the spark plug Fig. (4.19). The
resulting explosion of gases is what drives the piston downwards and more fuel-air
mixture has been drawn into the cylinder. As the piston moves downwards, it
uncovers the exhaust port. The exhaust gases ﬂow out of that port Fig. (4.19). As
the piston moves down even further Fig. (4.19), the transfer port becomes uncov-
ered and the compressed fuel-air mixture in the crankcase rushes into the cylinder
head above the piston, helping to displace any remaining exhaust gases. The piston
now starts back on its upward stroke.
Table 4.4 presents a quick comparison between two-stroke and four-stroke
engines.
4.3.3.3
Four-Stroke Diesel Engines
The Diesel cycle is the ideal cycle for CI reciprocating engines. The CI engine, ﬁrst
proposed by Rudolph Diesel in the 1890s, is very similar to the SI engine discussed
in the last section, differing mainly in the method of initiating combustion. In CI
engines (also known as diesel engines), the air is compressed to a temperature that
is above the auto-ignition temperature of the fuel, and combustion starts as the fuel

is injected into this hot air. Therefore, the spark plug and carburetor are replaced by
a fuel injector in diesel engines. The four strokes of diesel engines are plotted on
both P-v and T-s diagrams in Fig. 4.20.
In diesel engines, only air is compressed during the compression stroke, elimi-
nating the possibility of auto-ignition. Therefore, diesel engines can be designed to
operate at much higher compression ratios, typically between 12 and 24. Fuels that
are less reﬁned (thus less expensive) can be used in diesel engines. The fuel
injection process in diesel engines starts when the piston approaches TDC and
continues during the ﬁrst part of the power stroke. Therefore, the combustion
process in these engines takes place over a longer interval. Because of this longer
Fig. 4.19 Two-stroke Otto
cycle
4.3
Aerodynamics and Thermodynamics of Reciprocating ICE
253

duration, the combustion process in the ideal Diesel cycle is approximated as a
constant-pressure heat-addition process. In fact, this is the only process where the
Otto and the Diesel cycles differ. The remaining three processes are the same for
both ideal cycles. That is, process 1–2 is isentropic compression, process 2–3
constant-pressure heat addition, process 3–4 is isentropic expansion, and process
4–1 is constant-volume heat rejection. The similarity between the two cycles is also

Two-Stroke Diesel Engines
In a two stroke cycle CI engine, all the operations are exactly the same as those in
two-stroke SI engine except that in this case only air is taken in instead of air fuel
mixture and the fuel is injected at the end of compression stroke, a fuel injector
being ﬁtted instead of a spark plug.
Summary for piston engines used in Land, Sea, and Air applications
Table 4.5 provides a comparison of piston engines used in land, sea, and air
applications.
4.3.3.5
Superchargers/Turbochargers
As stated in Sect. 4.2.2.3, superchargers or turbochargers will increase the power
and efﬁciency of an internal combustion engine through increasing the pressure and
density of the inlet air using compressors. Two types of compressors are used,
4.3

257

namely, positive displacement and dynamic. Three types of positive is placement
compressors are extensively used; namely, the roots, vane, and screw compressor.
Two types of dynamic compressors are used; either centrifugal or axial.
Figure 4.21 illustrates the P-v and T-s diagrams for a supercharger coupled to an
aero piston engine performing an Otto cycle. Since the boost pressure (P1) is greater
than the ambient pressure (P0), then the pumping loop represents a positive work.
Hence to get the net indicated power (Pi), the power represented by pumping
loop is to be added:
Pi ¼ Area 1  2  3  4

ð4:40Þ
The power required for driving the supercharger can be calculated by considering
ﬂow in as an adiabatic steady ﬂow. The air enters the compressor at a pressure,
temperature, and enthalpy (P0, T0, h0). The work supplied to the supercharger is (w).
The air leaves the supercharger at a pressure, temperature, and enthalpy (P1, T1, h1).

Introduction
Aircraft propellers or airscrew convert rotary motion from piston engines or
turboprops to provide propulsive force (Fig. 4.24). They may be of ﬁxed or variable
pitch. In both cases, the propeller accelerates a large quantity of air through a small
velocity change. In turboprop engines, 80–90 % of the thrust is produced by a
turbine driven propeller and 10–20 % by the jet. While in piston engines, propellers
produce 100 % of thrust force.
Propeller has several deﬁnitions as follows:
A device having a central revolving hub with radiating blades, for propelling an
airplane, ship, etc. [7]
A device consisting of a set of two or more twisted, airfoil-shaped blades
mounted around a shaft and spun to provide propulsion of a vehicle through air
or water.
A type of fan that transmits power by converting rotational motion from piston
engine or turboprops into thrust to pull or push the airplane through the air.

A series of rotating wings (or airfoils) of equal length meeting at a center hub
attached to the crankshaft of aircraft engine.
In brief, propeller history has the following milestones:
Third century BC: Greek scientist Archimedes ﬁgured out how to enclose a long
spiral screw inside a cylinder to lift water.
Sixteenth century: Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) sketched an upward-facing
screw propeller on his design for a helicopter, which he never built.
1796: American inventor John Fitch made the ﬁrst basic propeller, shaped like a
screw, for a steamboat.
1836: Englishman Francis Petit-Smith and Swedish-American John Ericsson
independently developed modern-style propellers with blades for ships.
1903: The brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright used twisted propellers shaped
like airfoils to make the ﬁrst powered ﬂight, ushering in the modern age of air
travel.
1919: Fixed pitch propellers enter service
1924: The constant speed propeller is patented by Dr. H.S. Hele-Shaw and
T.E. Beacham
1932: Variable pitch propellers were introduced into air force service
1935: Constant speed propellers become available
1945: Five blade propellers installed to Rolls-Royce RB50 Trent turboprop
engine to power Gloster meteor
1980 High speed propellers tested by NASA for propfans to power transport
aircraft
4.4.2
Nomenclature
In order to explain the theory and construction of propellers, it is necessary ﬁrst to
deﬁne the parts of various types of propellers and give the nomenclature associated
with propellers. Figure 4.25 shows a ﬁxed-pitch one-piece wood propeller designed
for light aircrafts. Note carefully the hub, hub bore, bolt holes, neck, shank, blade,
tip, and metal tipping. In example, ﬁxed propeller is used in the WWI Nieuport 28.
The cross section of a propeller blade is a typical airfoil section as shown in
Fig. 4.26.
Figure 4.26 shows two views and various cross sections of a propeller blade. The
blade shank is the portion of the blade which is near the butt of the blade. It is
usually thick to give it strength, and it is cylindrical where it ﬁts the hub barrel, but
the cylindrical portion of the shank contributes little or nothing to thrust. In an
attempt to obtain more thrust, some propeller blades are designed so that the airfoil
section (shape) is carried all the way along the blade from the tip to the hub. In other
designs, the airfoil shape is carried to the hub by means of blade cuffs, which are
thin sheets of metal or other material, which function like cowling as shown in
Fig. 4.27. The cuff is a hard rubber shape that changes the airfoil of the propeller to
a more advantageous shape near the spinner.

Classiﬁcations
In this section, classiﬁcations for propellers based on different points are identiﬁed.
It is important to state here that classiﬁcations listed here are applied for both piston
engines and turboprop engines as well be discussed in Chap. 7. Classiﬁcations will
be followed hereafter based on different items.
4.5.1
Source of Power
As seen in Fig. 4.24, it may be either driven by:
Piston engines (crankshaft of a piston engine)
Turboprops (turbine shaft of a turboprop engine)
4.5.2
Material
Wood (solid or laminated) in very early types (Fig. 4.24), which were used
exclusively on personal and business aircraft prior to World War II.
Metal (later types)
After 1940, propellers were made of steel, but recent propellers are fabricated
from high-strength, heat-treated, aluminum alloy. Metal propeller is similar to the
wood propeller, except that the sections are generally thinner.

Composite materials (most modern designs)
In the 1960s, glass and ﬁber polymer composite propeller materials were used
for manufacturing propellers. Today nearly all the large propellers for aircrafts have
carbon ﬁber blades (Lockheed Hercules C-130 J). These are light weight, have high
speciﬁc strength, stiffness and excellent fatigue resistance, and its resistance to
erosion are three times that of aluminum alloys [8].

Control
Fixed pitch (small aircrafts)
Blades are ﬁxed at a certain ﬁxed angle to the hub, usually never changes (it can
be altered on the ground only and not during ﬂight). Wright brothers developed the
ﬁrst successful propellers of the ﬁxed pitch type.
Variable pitch (Bigger and more sophisticated planes)
Blades may be rotated about its long axis. It may be subdivided into:
Two-position propeller
Blades are limited to two angles, one for takeoff and climb (low speed operation)
and the other for cruising (high speed operation)
Adjustable pitch (ones whose pitch can be altered by the pilot)
Controllable pitch (has automatic mechanism to adjust its own pitch to match the
plane’s ﬂying speed)

267

Constant-speed (designed to change pitch automatically, allowing the engine
always to turn over at the same (constant) speed
Feathered (turning the propeller blades so they are edge on, making a very
shallow angle to the oncoming air, minimizing air resistance, and allowing the
plane either to keep on ﬂying on its remaining engines or glide to a crash landing).
On single-engine aircraft, the effect is to increase the gliding distance. On a multi-
engine aircraft, feathering the propeller on a failed engine allows the aircraft to
maintain altitude with the reduced power from the remaining engines.
Thrust reversal (the pitch of the blades can be reversed so a propeller makes a
forward draft of air instead of one moving backward – handy for extra braking
(especially if the main brakes on the wheels suddenly fail)).

Table 4.7 illustrates a comparison between ﬁxed and variable pitch propellers
from performance and cost points of view.
4.5.5
Number of Propellers Coupled to Each Engine
Single; Fig. 4.26
Double (contra-rotating) (Fig. 4.29)
Contra-rotating propellers, also referred to as coaxial contra-rotating propellers
or high-speed propellers, apply the maximum power of an engine (or engines) to
drive two propellers in contra-rotation (rotation about the same axis in opposite
directions). Two propellers are arranged one behind the other, and power is
transferred from the engine via a planetary gear or spur gear transmission.
4.5.6
Direction of Rotation
Nose installation (single engine)
Left-handed propeller
A left-handed propeller is one which when viewed from the cockpit rotates in an
anti-clockwise direction, while if viewed from outside the aircraft, positioned at the
front, propeller will rotate in a clockwise direction.
Right-handed propeller
A right-handed propeller will be seen to rotate clockwise from the cockpit, and
anti-clockwise when viewed from the front of the aircraft.
Wing installation (Even number of engines; two/four/six,..etc.)
Propellers may be:
Same rotation direction (for both wings)
The propellers on both engines of most conventional twin-engine aircraft spin
clockwise (as viewed from the pilot seat).
Counter-rotating (right wing has clockwise propeller rotation and left wing has
counter clockwise propeller rotation or vice-versa). The advantage of such designs
is that counter-rotating propellers balance the effects of torque and p-factor, elim-
inating the problem of the critical engine.

Counter-rotating pairs on each wing (Airbus A400M Atlas)
The pair of propellers on each wing of the A400M, Fig. 4.30 turn in opposite
directions, with the tips of the propellers advancing from above towards the
midpoint between the two engines. This is in contrast to the overwhelming majority
of multi-engine propeller driven aircraft where all propellers on the same wing turn
in the same direction.
The Wright Flyer has a single engine and a chain to drive its two propellers in
counter-rotation directions.
The following twin-engine aircrafts (one engine per wing) have counter-rotating
propellers: de Havilland Hornet, Lockheed P-38 Lightning, Henschel Hs 129, Piper
PA-31 Navajo, Piper PA-34 Seneca, Piper PA-39 Twin Comanche C/R, Piper
PA-40 Arapaho, and Piper PA-44 Seminole.
The six engines in Messerschmitt Me 323 were ﬁtted – to reduce torque – by a
trio of counterclockwise rotation engines mounted on the port wing, and a trio of
clockwise rotation engines on the starboard wing, resulting in the props rotating
“away” from each other at the tops of their arcs.

Aerodynamic Design
Aerodynamic developments of propellers started with the simple Rankine-Froude
momentum theory. Next, blade element theories provided more realistic results and
lead to practical propeller design calculations. Initially, lumped inﬂow factors [9]
are used to evaluate ﬂow velocities around a blade element.

This section will handle only actuator disk and blade element theories. For more
advanced work, the reader can review the work of Bocci [11]. Detailed description
for advanced methods is highlighted by Douglas Archer and Saarlas [12]. There is
also interest in transonic and supersonic propellers, but shockwave losses and noise
present severe problems.
4.6.1
Axial Momentum, (or Actuator Disk) Theory
Actuator disk is also sometime denoted as Rankine-Froude or slip stream Theory
(1865). The actuator disk theory replaces the propeller with an inﬁnitely thin plane
“actuator” disk, which imparts a certain momentum to the ﬂuid passing through it,
thus produces an increase in axial velocity and axial momentum (Fig. 4.35). This
theory provides an initial idea regarding the performance of a propeller (say
efﬁciency) but fails to furnish the required design data for the propeller blades.
The following assumptions and deﬁnitions are stated:
•
Fluid is one dimensional, perfect, incompressible, and isentropic
•
Flow has uniform properties (velocity and pressure) across any plane normal to
the ﬂow except for the discontinuous jump in pressure across the disk itself.
•
Rotation imparted to the ﬂow is neglected.
•
The streamlines at the edge of the disk deﬁne the outer limit of the contracting
streamtube, which passes through the disk and separates it from the surrounding

ﬂow. The streamtube has cylindrical sections in both far upstream and far
downstream.
•
The ﬂow outside the propeller stream tube has constant stagnation pressure
(no work is imparted to it).
Figure 4.35 illustrates ﬂuid streamlines, velocities, and pressures around the
plane of the propeller with the following designations for points: (1) Far upstream
the propeller
(2) Just in front of the propeller (3) Just after the propeller (4) Far downstream

The distance between (2) and (3) is assumed inﬁnitesimal.

Along the stream tube between stations 1 and 4, the velocity increases from the
free upstream value V1, at cross-sectional area A1, to the value V4 in the cross-
sectional area A4. The static pressure at stations 1 and 4 is the ambient atmospheric
value Pa (P1 ¼ P4 ¼ Pa), while pressure difference builds up across the disc.
The velocity at the disk, V2 ¼ V3 is written as:
V2 ¼ V1 1 þ a

disk and (a) is called the axial inﬂow factor.
In the fully developed slipstream, the velocity

Thrust
Apply the Newton second law (conservation of momentum principle) in the axial

direction:

Propulsive Efﬁciency
The propulsive efﬁciency (ηp) of a propeller is the ratio of the available power; or
sometimes identiﬁed as useful thrust power (PA ¼ TV) to the power delivered to the
propeller. For piston engines, this is the shaft brake power (P):
ηp ¼ PA
P ¼ TV
P
ð4:56Þ
For the actuator disk model, this efﬁciency is an ideal propulsive efﬁciency because
it ignores all losses except that associated with the streamwise kinetic energy. Using
Eqs. (4.524.50) and (4.54) gives

The ratio of these two powers, Eqs. (4.57) and (4.58), for the ideal actuator disk
model is called the ideal Froude efﬁciency (ηF) and is therefore the upper limit to
propeller performance:
ηF ¼

ð4:59Þ
Equation (4.59) proves that higher efﬁciency of propulsion can be achieved by large
rotors with very small increase in ﬂuid velocity (achieving thrust by large surfaces
rather than velocity). Ideal Froude efﬁciency (ηF) is always greater than the actual
propulsive efﬁciency (ηP).

powered by two piston engines each produces 2900 N thrust force. Each propeller

Modiﬁed Momentum or Simple Vortex Model
A practical assessment of propeller performance and design of realistic propellers
require inclusion of at least some of the foregoing effects and allowance for blading
details. In this simple vortex model, the effect of rotational ﬂow will be discussed
hereafter.
Consider a stream tube that passes through the propeller section at radius (r)
(Fig. 4.36). The corresponding angular speed at this blade section is (Ωr) where (Ω)
is the angular speed of propeller and (r) is the local radius of propeller. When ﬂuid
passes through the propeller section, it acquires an angular speed due to the swirling
nature of the ﬂow induced by the propeller. Thus the rotational speeds at propeller
sections are:
u ¼ aΩ Ω r
ð4:60Þ
where (aΩ) is the angular induced factor.
The local ﬂow velocity just downstream of the propeller blade is expressed as:

Blade Element Considerations
Blade element theory is similar to wing theory. In this theory, the blade is divided
into small sections, which are handled independently from each other. Each seg-
ment has a chord, a blade angle, and associated airfoil characteristics. This isolated
airfoil assumption is found to be substationally correct for two- or three-bladed
propellers, except near the hub.
At any given radius (r), the circumferential distance between two successive
blades is called spacing (s), while the length of blade section between leading and
trailing edges is called chord (c) (Fig. 4.37). Since (s/c) for two- and three-bladed
propellers are much greater than unity, this justiﬁes the use of isolated airfoil
characteristics in this theory. Multi-blade propellers, for which the (s/c) ratio has
fallen to a value of order (1) or less, will have to be treated as cascades.
The forces acting on a small section of the blade (lift and drag) are determined
and then integrated over the propeller radius in order to predict the thrust, torque,
and power characteristics of the propeller.
The forces acting on a small section of the blade (lift and drag) are ﬁrst
determined, next resolved into two perpendicular components in the axial and

tangential directions, and ﬁnally integrated over the propeller radius in order to
predict the thrust, torque, and power characteristics of the propeller.
A differential blade element of chord (c) and width (dr) located at a radius (r)
from the propeller axis is shown in Fig. 4.37a. The element is shown acting under
the inﬂuence of the rotational velocity (Vt), forward velocity ( ~
V
0), and the induced
velocity (w). The resultant or relative velocity (VR) is then expressed by the relation
VR ¼ ~

ð4:63Þ
and

ð

ð4:64Þ
The relative ﬂuid velocity varies from hub to tip, primarily under the inﬂuence
of the rotational velocity component (Ωr) and the inﬂow factor (a). Figure 4.37
shows the velocities and forces on a blade element that lies between radial stations

pitch angle, or blade angle (β), where

ð4:68Þ
Radial pitch distribution will be speciﬁed for a given blade, but a representative
pitch is quoted at a reference radius conventionally taken at either 70 % or 75 %
radius. Overall solid body pitch may be varied by rotation of the blade about its
radial axis.
4.6.3.1
Thrust and Torque
The axial and tangential forces on a blade element generate the thrust δT and torque
δFQ ¼ δQ=r contributions of the blade elements and can now be written as:
δT ¼ δL cos φ  δD sin φ ¼ l cos φ  d sin φ

ð4:69Þ

(δL and δD) are the lift and drag forces on blade element. Introducing the deﬁnitions
for lift and drag coefﬁcients (Cl and Cd) as well as dynamic pressure (q), then the lift
and drag forces per unit span length (l and d) are expressed as:

Introducing relations (4.71 and 4.72) into Eqs. (4.69) and (4.70), and assuming the

ð4:75bÞ
In the succeeding equations, thrust force is non-dimensionalized by (ρn2D4) to
obtain the coefﬁcient; Eq. (4.59a) and the torque will be non-dimensionalized by
(ρn2D5) to get the torque coefﬁcient (CQ); see Eq. (4.60a).

(VδT) to the supplied torque power (ΩδQ), or:
ηbe ¼ VδT

From Eqs. (4.67) and (4.72) as well as Fig. 4.37b, we get:

variation of blade element efﬁciency as a function of the advance angle (φ) and the
angle (ε).
The following two cases are identiﬁed:
1. ηbe ¼ 100%
This is the straight line case when:
ε ¼ a ¼ aΩ ¼ 0
2. ηbe ¼ variable
ε 6¼ 0, a 6¼ 0, aΩ 6¼ 0
In this case, blade element efﬁciency has zero value when
φ ¼ 0 and φ ¼ 90   ε
At an in-between value, the blade element efﬁciency acquires a maximum value,
which can be obtained by differentiating Eq. (4.80) with respect to (φ) and equating
the differential to zero, then:

Dimensionless Parameters
There are nine independent variables needed to deﬁne the performance of ﬁxed-
pitch propeller in subsonic ﬂight, namely: thrust force, torque, power, air density,
compressibility, air viscosity, propeller diameter, approach speed, and rotational
speed expressed by the variables between brackets, respectively; (T, Q, P, ρ, β, μ, D,
V, n). From these nine variables, and with the three fundamental units of mass [M],
length [L], and time [T], using dimensional analysis we get six (6 ¼ 9  3) dimen-
sionless groups or parameters. These are:

As discussed earlier, the maximum value of ideal Froude efﬁciencies ηF is 100 %,
while the peak for actual propulsive efﬁciency of propellers – Eq. (4.88) – is much
less than this value. This is due to the ignored losses in the ideal actuator disk model
arising from:
•
Rotational ﬂow (whirl) about the rotor axis in the wake
•
Proﬁle drag (viscous friction and form drag) of the ﬂow over the propeller blades
(near the high-speed zero-thrust condition, proﬁle drag is dominant) [9]
•
Interference effects in the hub region between multiple blades and nacelle
•
Compressibility effects (shock waves and shock/boundary layer interaction)
Lateral components of incoming ﬂow that occur when a propeller is yawed
Two other important parameters relevant to propeller power are power loading

loading, whereas the (AF) is designed to express the capacity of a blade to absorb
power. (AF) is dimensionless, with a value of about 80 per blade.

Typical Propeller Performance
Experimental testing of propellers started long ago by Wright Brothers during their
design of their ﬁrst airborne ﬂight machine. Extensive experimental work continued
and full-scale propeller testing was performed in NACA 20 ft. wind tunnel in
NASA Langley. Detailed analyses of 2-, 3-, and 4-bladed propeller having
CLARK Y and RAF series airfoil section was published in [14]. During the late
1930s, some NACA 4-digit airfoils were used extensively in propellers. Blade
thickness decreases from root to tip along the blade length as shown in Fig. 4.26.
The following NACA series are used for sections from hub to tip [19]:
NACA 4424/NACA 4418/NACA 2415/NACA 2412/NACA 2410/NACA 2408/
NACA 1412/NACA 1410/NACA 1408/NACA 0012/NACA 0009
To remind readers with airfoil designations, consider the section NACA 4428:
First integer (4) means that airfoil has a maximum camber (maximum value of
mean line ordinate) in percentage of chord (4 %)
Second integer (4) means the position of maximum camber in tenths of the chord
from leading edge (40 %)
Last two integers (15) denotes the maximum thickness in percentage of the
chord (15 %)
After World War II, NACA 16-series airfoils were derived for use at high
speeds, particularly for propeller applications [15]. This series has thin proﬁle
airfoils and thus has low drag at high speeds. Consequently, it is appropriate to
transonic propeller sections near the tip [16]. Continuous efforts continued where
computational analyses side by side with experimental ones are performed. A
detailed computational analysis of propeller performance using the commercial
code FLUENT 6.2 is presented in [17].
In general, the performance of a propeller is indicated by thrust coefﬁcient (CT),
power coefﬁcient (CP), and efﬁciency (ηp). These quantities depend on advance
ratio (J).
Figure 4.39 presents the propeller efﬁciency for two-bladed propeller. As clar-
iﬁed it depends on advance ratio (J) and pitch angle (β).
4.8
Typical Propeller Performance
293

Efﬁciency values are less than unity as expected, since the available power is
less than delivered one due to losses. These losses are attributed to translational and
rotational kinetic energy in the wake of propeller as discussed earlier in Froude and
modiﬁed momentum theories. Skin friction and proﬁle drag of propeller blades add
to the previous losses. For high speed propellers where the relative tip speed
approaches sonic values, shock waves as well as boundary layer interaction on
the suction sides of blade section result in additional losses.
For any pitch angles, propeller efﬁciency starts by a zero value at J ¼ 0,
increases to a maximum value and drops again to zero at high ﬁnite value of (J).
When J ¼ 0, then V ¼ 0, and consequently the available or thrust power (PA
TV
¼ 0), consequently ηP
PA=P ¼ 0
The other case of zero efﬁciency corresponds to a higher value of advance ratio
(J > 0), this corresponds to a high ﬂight speed. The corresponding relative speed
coincides with the zero lift (which in turn leads to zero thrust and zero efﬁciency).
For higher ﬂight (forward) speed, a negative lift is produced leading to reverse
thrust as shown in Fig. 4.40.
The maximum value of ηp is seen to be around 80–85 %. However, the value of
(J) at which the maximum of ηp occurs depends on the pitch angle (β). This
indicates that for a single pitch or ﬁxed pitch propeller, the efﬁciency is high
(80–85 %) only over a narrow range of ﬂight speeds Fig. 4.39.
At other ﬂight velocities, the propeller will operate at smaller efﬁciencies which
severely inﬂuence aircraft performance. For this reason, commercial airplanes use a
variable pitch propeller. In such a propeller, the entire blade is rotated through a
chosen angle during the ﬂight and the pitch of all blade elements changes. Such
propellers have high efﬁciency over a wide range of speeds. However, propellers
with variable pitch arrangements are expensive and heavy. Hence, small (personal)
airplanes, where cost of the airplane is an important consideration, employ a ﬁxed
pitch propeller. As a compromise, in some designs, propellers with two or three
pitch settings are employed.

two-bladed propeller with different values of (β).
Figure 4.42 presents the variation of power coefﬁcient (CP) versus J for
two-bladed propeller with (β) and (CT) as parameters.
Figures 4.40 through 4.42 can be combined and plotted in a single ﬁgure for each
pitch angle (β) as shown in Fig. 4.43. For each pitch angle (β), efﬁciency has zero

At small values of pitch angle, the thrust coefﬁcient is greater than power
coefﬁcient for any value of advance ratio. On the contrary, at high value of pitch
angle, the power coefﬁcient is greater than thrust coefﬁcient at any advance ratio.
Other ﬁgures for three- and four-bladed propellers (similar to Figs. 4.39, 4.41,
and 4.42) are found in reference [14]. However, recent propellers may have other
number of blades (5–8). Performance parameters like thrust coefﬁcient can be
obtained from the following equation [18]:

Then thrust coefﬁcient for eight-blade propeller:
At preliminary design stages, when the propeller diameter is not yet determined,
the speed-power coefﬁcient – Eqs. (4.86a) and (4.86b) – may be used. Thus new
plots for speed-power coefﬁcient as well as efﬁciency are ploted versus the advance
ratio. Two methods for plotting these relations are found in Figs. 4.44 and 4.45.
Figure 4.44 provides the locus of maximum efﬁciency for different speed power
coefﬁcient.
Figure 4.45 provides iso-efﬁcieny lines ploted over constant speed-power coef-
ﬁcient and advance ratio parameter. It is quite similar with the compressor map as
will be explained later on in turbomachinery sections.
Figure 4.46 provides values of efﬁciency at different pitch angle corresponding
to a constant speed-power coefﬁcient. As noticed from this ﬁgure, efﬁciency
increases by increase of pitch angle for same speed-power coefﬁcient value.

Since the thrust force was obtained before T ¼ 12, 000 N, the summation of thrust
increment obtained in Table (4.9) yields nearly the same design value (12,000 N);
the assumptions set earlier are satisfactory. If not, then an iteration procedure is to
be employed by varying one or more of the following variables:
•
Flight speed
•
Chord length of blade
•
Airfoil section, which contributes different lift and drag coefﬁcients.
Example 4.9 An aircraft is ﬂying at a speed of 540 km/h speed at sea level. It is
powered by a three-bladed propeller developing 1600 kW. Propeller is connected to
a piston engine rotating at 2600 rpm, through a 1:2 gear box. The propeller is
designed with blades of NACA 5869–9 blade sections. At 0.75 R, it has a pitch
angle β ¼ 35. Use the given chart for speed-power coefﬁcient to compute the
propeller diameter and the efﬁciency of the propeller at this operating condition.
Solution
Density of the air at this sea level operating condition is ρ ¼ 1:225 kg=m3

Conclusion
This chapter focused on aerodynamics of both piston engines and aircraft pro-
pellers. Aero piston engines were the ﬁrst prime mover used in aircrafts since the
early Flyer 1903 of Wright brothers and extensively used until now. Both petrol and
diesel engines were analyzed. Superchargers used for boosting power in high
altitudes were also discussed. Since piston engines alone cannot support aircraft’s
ﬂight, a propeller is installed either directly or via a reduction gearbox to piston
engine. Basic theories for propeller aerodynamics, namely, momentum, modiﬁed
momentum, and blade-element theories, are reviewed. Propellers will be further
reviewed in Chap. 7 handling turboprops as one of the shaft engine types. These
will be high speed propellers.

Pulsejet, Ramjet, and Scramjet Engines
5.1
Introduction to Athodyd Engines
Different athodyd engines (where athodyd stands for Aero THermODYnamic Duct)
will be treated here. These engines are pulsejet, ramjet, and scramjet engines. The
latter two are identiﬁed as Ram-Based Cycle (RBC) Engines. These engines have
no major rotating parts (fan/compressor or turbine) and consist of an entry duct, a
combustion chamber, and a nozzle [1].
Pulsejet engine will be treated ﬁrst. It operates intermittently and has found
limited applications [2, 3] as there are great difﬁculties of its integration into
manned aircraft. Its other disadvantages are high fuel consumption, poor efﬁciency,
severe vibration, and high noise. The second engine to be analyzed here is ramjet
engine. Ramjet engines are appropriate for supersonic ﬂight speeds though were
also used in subsonic ﬂight conditions [4]. Its ram compression of air becomes
sufﬁcient to overcome the need for mechanical compression achieved normally by
compressors or fans in other TBC engines. The third type is the scramjet engine. Its
name scramjet is abbreviated from Supersonic Combustion Ramjet. If the ﬂight
speed of a ramjet is so high that fuel combustion must occur supersonically, then
this ramjet is identiﬁed as a scramjet [5]. Scramjet engine operates at the speeds of
rockets. Its main difference from a rocket is that it collects air from the atmosphere
to burn its fuel rather than carrying its oxidizer on board.
5.2
Pulsejet
5.2.1
Introduction
A pulse jet (or pulsejet) engine is a very simple jet engine, which can be made with
a few or no moving parts. It comprises an air intake, a combustion chamber, and an

acoustically resonant exhaust pipe. Intake of air is intermittent, thus combustion
occurs in pulses, resulting in a pulsating thrust rather than a continuous one and thus
has found limited applications [2].
Consequently, pulsejet engine (PJ) is similar to piston engines in its intermittent
combustion nature. In the same time, it is similar to all jet engines in generating
thrust via reaction principle for propulsion. Thus, one can say that pulsejet engine
resembles a transitional development between older piston engines and subsequent
jet engines. The advantages of pulsejet engine are extremely light, simple, cheap,
easy to construct, uses both atmospheric oxygen and cheap fuels, and capable of
running statically. Another important advantage is the pressure gain across the
combustor in contrast to pressure loss in other jet engines. However, its main
disadvantages are low reliability, poor fuel economy, severe vibration, poor com-
pression ratio, low speciﬁc impulse, and very high noise levels. The high noise
levels make them practical only for military applications. The ﬁrst 50 years of
twentieth century showed great interest in pulsejet engines. However, with the
improvements in power and efﬁciency of turbojets, pulse jets ceased to receive
attention. Various organizations, both private and public, continued a limited pulse
jet research in the period 1940–1970. Recently, however, with the interest in
UAV’s, various agencies and contractors have started looking for ways to propel
these tiny vehicles with an efﬁcient, affordable, and robust power source.
Pulsejets have three types, namely: Valved, Valveless, and Pulse detonation
engine (PDE).
The valved type is ﬁtted with a one-way valve, while a valveless engine has no
mechanical valves at its intake. The pulse detonation engine is a concept currently
in active development to create a jet engine that operates on the supersonic
detonation of fuel.
5.2.2
Brief History
1. Martin Wiberg (1826–1905) developed the ﬁrst pulse jet in Sweden. While V.V.
Karavodin patented in 1906 and completed a working engine in 1907 in Russia,
which was a high velocity pulsed gas jet generated by a cyclic combustion of a
liquid hydrocarbon fuel/air mixture [6].
Marconnet in 1907 invented his valveless pulsejet engine in France [7], which is
composed of an inlet diffuser, combustor, and outlet longer exhaust pipe in order to
direct most of the combusted mixtures through exhaust rather than through intake.
In 1939, the most infamous pulsejet Schmidt Argus V1 pulsejet was developed by
German Paul Schmidt and manufactured by Argus Company. It is known as
Schmidt Argus V1 pulsejet. That pulsejet was used to power the Fieseler Fi
103 V-1 “Buzz Bomb” shown in Fig. 5.1. It is an unmanned bomb steered by a
gyro. When the fuel ran out, it just dropped down from the sky and explodes on the
ground. It had a mass of 4750 lbs and produced 650 lbs of thrust at an altitude of
316

3000 ft and at a cruise speed of 400 mph [8]. It could be launched from a 152 ft
inclined ramp by a Walter steam (or hydrogen peroxide) catapult, or air-dropped
from a carrier aircraft (usually He III Hs of KG 3 and later KG 63). The V-1 pulsejet
was the ﬁrst cruise missile. It was extensively used in bombing England and
Belgium during WWII.
In July 1944, captured V-1 components were shipped to USA, where the USAAF
and American industry had built their own V-1, designated as the “Jet Bomb
2 (JB-2)” and more informally known as the “Thunderbug”. First successful launch
of a JB-2 was on 5 June 1945. The JB-2 s were easily launched off a rail with a solid
rocket booster. The USAAF also experimented with air-launching the JB-2 from a
B-17 bomber, B-24 s, and B-29 s. Also Ford built the pulse jet engine, designated
“PJ-31” in USA.
The US Navy experimented its V-1 variant, the “KUW-1 (later LTV-N-2)
Loon”. The submarine USS CUSK was modiﬁed to launch the Loon ﬂying bombs
in February 1947. In 1948, the surface vessel USS NORTON SOUND was modiﬁed
for Loon launches and performed four launches in 1949 and 1950.
The Soviets also built copies and derivatives of the V-1.
In 1944, Japan also relied upon Argus pulse jet Fieseler Fi-103 “Reichenberg”
(Fi103R) manned V-1 in designing their rocket-powered aircrafts for suicide mis-
sions known as Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka Japanese ﬂying bomb against Allied naval
forces. Carried aloft by G4M ‘Betty’ bombers, the Ohkas remained attached until
21 miles off the target [9].
In the 1950s, French operated a target drone based on the V-1 and designated the
“Arsenal 5.501”, which differed from the original design in having twin tail ﬁns and
radio control.
In the early 1940s, Lt. William Schubert of the US navy designed his valveless
pulsejet engine called the “resojet”. Its two main advancements over Marconnet’s
design were the combustor entry has sudden expansion and produces higher
turbulence for the thorough mixing of the air and fuel molecules. The second is

that the intake geometry was carefully designed so that the exhaust gas does not
escape before the pressure inside the chamber falls below atmospheric.
In 1950, Bertin and his fellow engineers at SNECMA Corporation (France)
developed Escopette engine, which is known to be the best performing valveless
pulsejet engine in history. Escopette backward bent intake provides additional
thrust to the engine [6]. Instead of using a straight exhaust pipe a series of steps
of increasing section is used. Escopette engine was intended for commercial
applications, thus was extensively tested on French Emouchet SA 104 sailplane
in various conﬁgurations [6].
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Lockwood of Hiller aircraft invented his
famous U- shaped valveless pulsejet or Lockwood hiller engine, which is consid-
ered the most effective pulsejet ever. The short pipe is the intake pipe and the long
curved shape pipe denotes the exhaust pipe. Lockwood engines are usually variable
area throughout the engine. It was used for military purpose (Model HH 5.25–7) to
produce a thrust of 280 pounds. Another notable feature in lockwood engine is that
the addition of augmenters at the end of the intake as well as exhaust port.
Augmenter uses exhaust hot gas to suck in fresh air and increase the thrust.
In the 1970s and 1980s, J.A.C Kentﬁeld (Canada) introduced recuperator for
thrust augmentation. Instead of making a simple tube bent backwards, he used a
ﬂaring cone at the end, which is referred to as secondary thrust augmentation. This
method allows the cone to suck in more fresh air and adds to more reaction mass.
It is worth mentioning that after WWII pulsejets have been used to power:
1. Experimental helicopters where these engines were attached to the extreme ends
of the rotor blades in the 1950s. They have also been used in both tethered and
radio-control model aircraft.
2. Go karts were also powered by pulsejets generating some 100 lb thrust similar to
Argus V1 and Lookwood valveless engines
3. Model airplanes where Dyna-jet engines were used and these models reached
speeds over 150 mph in the 1950s
4. Boats could reach speed more than 45 mph when powered by two pulsejet
engines each 105 lb thrust in the 1950s. Its drawbacks were noise which spread
to several miles away as well as its high fuel consumption (6 gallons of gasoline
per mile)
5. In the twenty-ﬁrst century, with the interest in UAVs, various agencies and
contractors have started looking for ways to propel these tiny vehicles with an
efﬁcient, affordable, and robust power source. Pulsejets are one of these options.
6. The ﬂying bomb concept can be seen today in the modern cruise missile.
5.2.3
Valved Pulsejet
Valved type has an air scoop and a set of one-way valves (check valves which is
sometimes denoted as shutter) through which the incoming air passes. Fuel in the
form of a gas or liquid aerosol is either mixed with the air in the intake or injected
318
5
Pulsejet, Ramjet, and Scramjet Engines

into the combustion chamber. When the air/fuel is ignited, these valves slam shut,
thus hot gases leave through the engine’s tailpipe, thus creating forward thrust
(Fig. 5.2). The cycle frequency is primarily dependent on the length of the engine.
For a small model-type engine, the frequency may be typically around 250 pulses
per second – whereas for a larger engine such as the one used on the German V1
ﬂying bomb, the frequency was closer to 45 pulses per second. Once the engine is
running, it requires only an input of fuel, but it usually requires forced air and an
ignition method for the fuel-air mix. The main drawback of valved type is that the
valves require regular replacement and represent a weak link in the engine’s
reliability.
5.2.4
Thermodynamic Cycle
Figure 5.3 illustrates the simple construction of valved type together with its cycle
on the temperature entropy diagram. Air is sucked into the combustion chamber
through a bank of spring-loaded check one way valves. Next, a carefully adjusted
amount of fuel is sprayed into the cold combustion chamber in order to create a
mixture and the resultant strong explosion starts the cycle. The fuel ﬂow, injected
directly into the combustion chamber, is continuous throughout the cycle with some
variation in fuel ﬂow resulting from the pressure in the combustion chamber. This
fuel ﬂow ﬂuctuation can be neglected. The resultant high pressure and temperature
forces the gases to ﬂow out of the tail pipe at high velocity.
At the end of discharge, the inertia of the gas creates a vacuum in the combustion
chamber which together with the ram pressure developed in the diffuser causes
sufﬁcient pressure differential to open the check valves. A new charge of air enters
the chamber and a new cycle starts. The frequency of the cycle depends on the size
of the engine, and the dynamic characteristics of the valves must be matched
carefully to this frequency. Small size engines operate as high as 300–400 cycles
per second, and large engines operate as low as 40 cycles per second.
Pulsejets operate on the Humphrey cycle as shown in Fig. 5.3. The four step
cycle starts at state (a) with isentropic compression followed by isochoric heat
addition, isentropic expansion, and lastly, isobaric heat rejection as it returns to
state (a).

1. Intake or diffuser
This process occurs from state (a) to state (2) as shown in Fig. 5.3. Air is sucked
into the combustion chamber through a bank of spring-loaded check (one way)
valve. State (a) is far upstream, while state (1) is at the pulsejet inlet, and state (2) is
just aft of the check valve upstream of the combustion chamber. Due to ram effect,
both the pressure and temperature rise from the ambient conditions to the values at
state (1) calculated by the relations:

Here (M) is the ﬂight Mach number and (γc) is the speciﬁc heat ratio for cold air. If
it is assumed that the diffuser is an ideal one (isentropic process), then the total

2. Combustion chamber
Fuel is added to the combustion chamber through several fuel injectors placed
after the valves and a spark plug mounted on top of engine initiates the combustion
process, which occurs at something approaching a constant-volume process
[1, 10]. The spark plug igniter is only needed for the initial start-up. Once started,
the engine will continue to operate on its own, with hot residual combustion gases
subsequently in a cyclic manner igniting incoming fresh fuel–air mixtures in a low–
high–low passive pressure cycle. Such combustion occurs in the form of an
explosion, which raises the pressure in the combustion chamber to a high level
and closes the spring valve at the intake. Thus for such isochoric heat addition, the
pressure ratio is

Some treatments for Humphrey cycle ignore the ﬁrst process and consider it as

Valveless Pulsejet
Valveless engine is one of the simplest jet engines in the world as it has no
mechanical valves, but it does have aerodynamic valve, which, for the most part,
restricts the ﬂow of gases to a single direction just as their mechanical counterparts.
Valveless pulsejet engine is sometimes identiﬁed as acoustic jet engine [11], or
aerovalved and also intermittent ramjet [12].
This engine has no moving parts which mean no wear. It is similar to a ramjet in
that respect.
Valveless pulse jet is designed to resolve the wear issues of valves in valved
type. They have all the advantages and most of the disadvantages of conventional
valved pulsejets [1]. Fuel consumption is excessively high, and the noise level is
unacceptable for recent standards. However, they do not have the troublesome reed
5.2
Pulsejet
327

valves that need frequent replacement. They can operate for their entire useful life
with practically zero maintenance. They have been used to power model aircraft,
experimental go-karts, and even some unmanned military aircraft such as target
drones. The intake and exhaust pipes usually face the same direction. This neces-
sitates bending the engine into a “U” shape as shown in Fig. 5.5 or placing a
180bend in the intake tube.
In this type of pulsejet, combustion process generates two shock wave fronts,
one travels down each tube. By properly “tuning” of the system a stable,
reasonating combustion process can be achieved which yields a considerable
thrust.
The engine can be built in many different sizes from a few centimeters in
length to huge sizes. The smallest ones are only successful when extremely fast-
burning fuels are employed acetylene or hydrogen, for example. Medium- and
larger-sized engines can burn almost any ﬂammable material delivered uniformly
to the combustion zone, though of course volatile ﬂammable liquids (gasoline,
kerosene, various alcohols) and standard fuel gases (propane, butane, MAPP gas)
are easiest to use. Because of the deﬂagration nature of pulsejet combustion,
these engines are extremely efﬁcient combustors, producing practically no haz-
ardous pollutants, even when using hydrocarbon fuels. With modern high-
temperature
metals

the
main
structure,

can

extremely low.
Up to the present, the physical size of successful valveless designs has always
been somewhat larger than valved engines for the same thrust value, though this is
theoretically not a requirement. An ignition system of some sort is required for
engine startup. In the smallest sizes, forced air at the intake is also typically needed
for startup.

Pulsating Nature of Flow Parameters in Pulsejet
Engines
Several researches were performed to examine the ﬂuctuating nature of ﬂow
properties within pulsejets since the 1940s [13]. Experimental investigations are
still going on [14, 15] as well as other numerical ones [11]. The fundamental
operating frequency of the pulsejet ( f : cycles/sec or Hz) is primarily related to
the overall length of pulsejet (combustion and tail pipe) and can be expressed as:
f  1
L
ð5:13Þ
In acoustic terminology, a conventional pulsejet operates on a (4L) wave system.
That is to say, four pressure waves (compression–rarefaction–rarefaction–compres-
sion; C _R _R _C) moving at or slightly above the local gas sound speed sequen-
tially traverse the duct system (combustor +tailpipe ¼ combustion tube of length 4L
in one operational cycle. Thus the operational period for one cycle in seconds is
approximately:
Δtcyc  4L
a  1
f
ð5:14Þ
Various parameters in pulsejets like air mass ﬂow rate, pressure, temperature, Mach
number, and thrust force have pulsating nature. Numerical simulation for various
parameters in valved pulsejet was given in [14].
As a trial for idealization of such pulsating behavior, a sinusoidal representation
of the combustor pressure proﬁle with time can be suggested [12]. Figure 5.6
illustrates the upper and lower absolute pressure limits about the idealized baseline
pressure. Since they are nearly equal in magnitude, then ΔP ¼ 100% for a
symmetrical cycle (vacuum limit; P ﬃ0, as the most negative trough point possible
in the idealized sinusoidal cycle acting to enforce this limitation on performance).
Fig. 5.6 Idealized sinusoidal ﬂuctuations in combustion pressure (P) and thrust force (T) versus
time (t)
5.2
Pulsejet
329

Analogous to the assumed idealized sinusoidal combustor pressure–time proﬁle
of Fig. 5.6, one can assume a corresponding thrust–time proﬁle would then have
also a sinusoidal shape as shown in Fig. 5.6. Assuming that no appreciable negative
thrust (resulting from backﬂow during the induction phase of the operational cycle),
the remaining positive components of the cyclic thrust proﬁle would produce a net
mean thrust of
T ¼ Tmax
π
ð5:15Þ
It is worth mentioning here that the results of numerical calculations in [16] are far
from Eq. (5.15). In a case study, the maximum thrust was 110 N while the average
was 19.5 N.
5.2.7
Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE)
The pulse detonation engine (PDE) marks a new approach towards non-continuous
combustion in jet engines. They are light, easy to manufacture, and promises higher
fuel efﬁciency compared even to turbofan engines. With the aid of latest design
techniques and high pulse frequencies, the drawbacks of the early designs promise
to be overcome. To date, no practical PDE engine has been put into production, but
several test bed engines have been built by Pratt & Whitney and General Electric
that have proven the basic concept. Extensive research work is also carried out in
different NASA centers. In theory, the design can produce an engine with the
efﬁciency far surpassing gas turbine with almost no moving parts. These systems
should be put to use in the near future.
All regular jet engines operate on the deﬂagration of fuel, that is, the rapid but
relatively gentle subsonic combustion of fuel. The pulse detonation engine is a
concept currently in active development to create a jet engine that operates on the
supersonic detonation of fuel [1].
Pulse detonation engines (PDEs) are an extension of pulse-jet engines. They
share many similarities including the operating Humphrey’s cycle. However, there
is one important difference between them, namely, PDEs detonate, rather than
deﬂagrate, their fuel. Detonation of fuel is a sudden and violent supersonic com-
bustion of fuel that results in immense pressure which in turn used as thrust.
Combustion process in PDE resembles perfectly constant volume combustion,
while combustion process in valveless and valved pulsejets is approximated only
as a constant volume process [10, 12]. Others identify combustion in PDE as neither
constant volume nor constant pressure [17]. Details of test results of both PDE and
pulsejet are given in [14]. PDE achieves higher speciﬁc impulse in comparison with
pulsejet engines for same operating static conditions. The main objective of PDE is
to provide an efﬁcient engine that is primarily used for high-speed (about Mach 5)
civilian transport as well as many military applications including supersonic
330
5
Pulsejet, Ramjet, and Scramjet Engines

vehicles, cruise missiles, UAVs, SSTO launchers, and rockets. However, their noise
and the drop in efﬁciency at higher Mach number imply that pure PDEs will likely
not to be used often for large-scale applications.
The single ﬂight of an aircraft powered by a pulse detonation engine took place
at the Mojave Air & Space Port on 31 January 2008 [18]. The aircraft selected for
the ﬂight was a heavily modiﬁed Scaled Composites Long-EZ, named Borealis.
The engine consisted of four tubes producing pulse detonations at a frequency of
80 Hz, creating up to 890 Newton of thrust and using a reﬁned octane as fuel. A
small rocket system was used to facilitate the liftoff of the Long-EZ, but the PDE
operated under its own power for 10 s at an altitude of approximately 100 ft
(30 m). This demonstration showed that a PDE can be integrated into an aircraft
frame without experiencing structural problems from the 195 to 200 dB detonation
waves.
Pulse detonation engines use intermittent detonation waves to generate thrust.
The cycle of PDE is illustrated in Fig. 5.7. Its cycle is also idealized by
Humphrey cycle shown in Fig. 5.3. Unlike the pulsejet, combustion in PDE is
supersonic, effectively an explosion instead of burning, and the shock wave of the
combustion front inside the fuel serves the purpose of shutters of valved pulsejet.
A detonation propagating from the closed end of the tube is followed by an
unsteady expansion wave (called Taylor wave), whose role is to bring the ﬂow to
rest near the closed end of the tube. When the shock wave reaches the rear of
engine and exits, the combustion products are ejected in “one go”, the pressure
inside the engine suddenly drops, and the air is pulled in front of the engine to
start the next cycle.
PDE operation is not determined by the acoustics of the system and can be
directly controlled. PDEs typically operate at a frequency of 50–100 Hz, which
means that a typical cycle time is on the order of 10–20 ms. Since PDE produces a
higher speciﬁc thrust than a comparable ramjet engines at low supersonic speeds, it
is suitable for use as part of a multi-stage propulsion system. The speciﬁc impulse
for PDE is plotted versus several other pulse and ramjet engine for comparison as
shown in Fig. 5.8. Single-tube supersonic impulse PDE with straight detonation has
higher performance than ideal ramjet engines for ﬂight Mach number up to 1.35.
The PDE can provide static thrust for a ramjet or scramjet engine or operate in
combination with turbofan systems.
PDE can be classiﬁed as:
•
Pure (standalone)
•
Combined cycles
•
Hybrid turbomachinery cycles
Pure PDE as the name implies consists of an array of detonation tubes, an
inlet, and a nozzle. The applications of pure PDEs are mainly military, as they are
light, easy to manufacture, and have higher performance around Mach 1 than
current engine technologies. Their noise and the drop in efﬁciency at higher Mach
number imply that pure PDEs will likely not to be used often for large-scale
applications.
5.2
Pulsejet

Combined-cycle PDEs may provide the most exciting possibilities for aviation.
Adding a PDE to the ﬂowpath of a ramjet or scramjet would make an engine
capable of operating efﬁciently as high as Mach 5.5. These engines would seem
initially suitable for high altitude, high-speed aircraft [19].
Hybrid PDE’s make use of detontative combustion in place of constant pressure
combustion, usually in combination with turbomachinery.
Hybrid engines are of two types, one in which the PDE replaces the conventional
combustor, but has several disadvantages among which providing high temperature
ﬂow into turbine blades [20]. An alternate approach involves arranging the PDE
combustor in the bypass duct of turbofan engines and mixing the PDE exhaust with
the turbine exhaust in a mixer located aft of the turbine, which resembles a mixed
turbofan arrangements as well be described in Chap. 6 [21]. In other researches of
Fig. 5.7 PDE thermodynamic cycle

hybrid turbofan-PDE: The central core engine would still turn the large fan in front,
but the bypass would ﬂow into a ring of PDEs [22, 23] in an unmixed turbofan
arrangement as will also be analyzed in Chap. 6. The bypass air enters pulse
detonation tubes that surround the standard combustion chamber (Fig. 5.9). The
tubes are then cyclically detonated; one detonates while the others ﬁll with air or are
primed with fuel. This combination promises to require simpler engine mechanisms
and yield higher thrust with lower fuel consumption as examined by GE.

Hybrid PDEs will allow commercial aircraft powered by subsonic gas turbines
to be faster, more efﬁcient, and more environmentally friendly. Similarly, hybrid
supersonic gas turbines can also be used in military applications. Generally, hybrid
PDEs will deliver the same thrust of a turbofan engine but with less fuel consump-
tion. Moreover, they would produce signiﬁcantly more thrust without requiring
additional fuel.

Pulsejet, Ramjet, and Scramjet Engines

5.3
Ramjet
5.3.1
Introduction
A ramjet (Stato-Re´acteur) is another type of athodyd airbreathing jet engine that
was ﬁrst proposed by Rene Lorin in 1913. It uses the forward motion of engine to
compress the incoming air, without a rotary compressor. Thus a ramjet is much like
a valveless pulsejet but it operates with continuous combustion rather than the
series of explosions that give a pulsejet its characteristic noise. Ramjet engine may
be either of the subsonic or supersonic type. In either cases, ramjet depends on the
compression of the in-rushing air for its operation, or in other words depends on the
ﬂight speed. A vehicle powered by a ramjet cannot develop static thrust and
therefore cannot accelerate a vehicle from a standing start. The vehicle must ﬁrst
be accelerated by other means to a sufﬁciently high speed prior to using a ramjet as
a propulsive device. It may be dropped from a plane or launched by rocket assist.
The theoretical upper operating limit for engines with subsonic combustion is
not a hard line, but lies somewhere between Mach 4 and Mach 8 depending on the
fuel used, usually about Mach 5.5.
Although ramjet can operate at subsonic ﬂight speed, the increasing pressure rise
accompanying higher ﬂight speeds renders the ramjet most suitable for supersonic
and most efﬁcient at speeds around Mach 3. For this reason, subsonic ramjets are
seldom (if ever) used these days. Figure 5.10 illustrates a subsonic ramjet engine
(A) and a supersonic engine (B and C).
The ramjet has been called a ﬂying stovepipe, because it is open at both ends and
has only fuel nozzles in the middle. A straight stovepipe would not work however; a
ramjet must have a properly shaped inlet-diffusion section to produce low-velocity,
high-pressure air at the combustion section and it must also have a properly shaped
Fig. 5.10 Types of ramjet engines subsonic (a) and supersonic (b and c)

exhaust nozzle. High speed air enters the inlet, is compressed as it is slowed down,
is mixed with fuel and burned in the combustion chamber, and is ﬁnally expanded
and ejected through the nozzle. The air rushing toward the inlet of an engine ﬂying
at high speeds is partially compressed by the so-called ram effect. If the ﬂight speed
is supersonic, part of this compression actually occurs across a shock wave system
that is either external or external-internal to the inlet. When the ﬂight speed is high
enough, this compression will be sufﬁcient to operate an engine without a com-
pressor. Once the compressor is eliminated, the turbine is no longer required and it
is omitted. Ramjets can operate at speeds above 320 km/h (about 200 mph) or as
low Mach number as 0.2. However, the fuel consumption is horrendous at these low
velocities. The operation of ramjet does not become competitive with that of a
turbojet until speeds of about Ma ¼ 2:5or even more are reached. Ramjets become
practical for military applications only (almost exclusively in missiles) at very high
or supersonic speeds (up to ﬂight Mach number of 6 for example). The combustion
region is generally a large single combustor, similar to afterburner [25]. Combustion
process occurs in subsonic speeds. Thus the upper operating ﬂight speeds lies
somewhere between Mach 4 and Mach 8 depending on the fuel used, usually
about Mach 5.5.
Advantages and disadvantages of ramjet engines may be summarized as follows:
Advantages
•
Able to attain high speeds (around Mach 5)
•
No moving parts so less wear and tear as well as minimum losses
•
Reduced weight and smaller engine
•
Lighter and simpler than turbine based engines
•
Higher temperatures can be employed
Disadvantages
•
Bad performance at lower speeds
•
Needs booster to accelerate it to a speed where ramjet begins to produce thrust
•
Higher fuel consumption
•
Maximum operating altitude is limited
•
High temperature material is required

Ramjet engines are used in propelling both of missiles and aircrafts. In the next

Figure 5.11 illustrates the ramjet engine (7 ft long and 20 inches in diameter)
powered Gorgon IV air-to-air missile. It was positioned below the missile which in
turn was mounted below the wing of a P-61 Black Widow for ﬂight testing.
(II) Aircraft Applications
A variant of the pure ramjet engine is coupled to other type of engines (piston/
turbojet/turbofan) to power aircrafts to overcome the limitations of the pure ramjet.
Some ramjet engines arranged by country are listed hereafter.
(A) France
Two distinct ramjets were manufactured, namely:
(i) The Leduc 0.10 was a research aircraft (achieved Mach 0.84 at 26,000 ft),
powered solely by a Leduc ramjet engine, which was designed to separate from
the airplane that brought it to altitude (SNCASE SE.161 Languedoc four-
engined airliner produced by SNCASE (Sud-Est)). It produced 15.7 kN thrust
and ﬂew in October 1947 (Fig. 5.12).
(ii) The Nord 1500 Griffon was an experimental ramjet-powered a Mach 2 ﬁghter
aircraft designed and built in the mid-1950s by Nord Aviation. Griffon II a
research ﬁghter having a maximum speed of Mach 2.19 (or 2330 km/h) was

ﬁtted with the deﬁnitive hybrid engine (turbo-ramjet) composed of ATAR
101E-3 turbojet (34.3 kN) and Nord Stato-Re´acteur ramjet (68.0 kN).
(B) Germany
In 1936, Hellmuth Walter constructed a test engine powered by natural gas. In
1941, Eugen Sa¨nger of the DFL proposed a ramjet engine with a very high

combustion chamber temperature. He constructed a very large diameter ramjet
pipes and carried out combustion tests at ﬂight speeds of up to 200 m/s.
(C) Japan
The ATREX engine is an example for AirTurbo Ramjet (ATR), which is a
“combined cycle” engine, intended to overcome the limitations of the pure ramjet
[26]. It operates as a conventional turbojet at subsonic speeds and a fan assisted
ramjet at speeds below Mach 6.
(D) (Former) Soviet Union
In the Soviet Union, a theory of supersonic ramjet engines was presented in 1928
by Boris S. Stechkin. In August 1939, Yuri Pobedonostsev developed the ﬁrst
ramjet engine for use as an auxiliary motor of an aircraft, the DM-1. The world’s
ﬁrst ramjet-powered airplane ﬂight took place in December 1939, using two DM-2
engines on a modiﬁed Polikarpov I-15. Two of his DM-4 engines were installed on
the YaK-7PVRD ﬁghter during World War II.
(E) United States of America
1. The Lockheed X-7 was an unmanned test bed for ramjet. It was carried aloft by a
B-29 or B-50 Superfortress carrier aircraft. The booster rocket ignited after
launch and propelled the vehicle to a speed of 1000 mph (1625 km/h). The
booster was then jettisoned, and the under slung ramjet took over from that point.
A total of 130 X-7 ﬂights were conducted from April 1951 to July 1960.
2. The Lockheed D-21 was a Mach 3+ reconnaissance drone designed to be
launched off the back of its M-21 carrier aircraft and was modiﬁed to be
launched from a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. Only four operational D-21 ﬂights
were made over the People’s Republic of China before the program was can-
celed in 1971.
3. SR-71 high speed reconnaissance aircraft is powered by a hybrid engine, part
turbojet, part ramjet (identiﬁed as turbo-ram engine).
5.3.3
Aero-Thermodynamic Analysis of Modules
In this section, different modules of Ram Based Cycle (RBC) Engines will be
described. These three modules are intake (inlet or diffuser), combustor (or burner),
and nozzle. First, it will be treated as a black boxes. Aero- and thermo-dynamics of
air/gas ﬂow upstream and downstream of each component are sufﬁcient for analysis
of each component. These data are necessary and sufﬁcient for calculating engine’s
cycle. Thus global parameters like thrust, TSFC, range as well as different efﬁcien-
cies (propulsive, thermal, and overall) will be deﬁned. Detailed analyses of each
component will be discussed in later chapters.

5.3.3.1
Intake (Inlet) Module
Intake is the ﬁrst component of any air-breathing engine. Intake section may have a
circular/oval or rectangular inlet. It also may have a constant or variable area inlet.
Supersonic ramjets may contain inlet cones (sometimes called shock cones/inlet
center bodies/ spike) or compression ramps for shocks capture during supersonic
ﬂight speeds. In such cases, external/internal (mixed) compression intake is
selected. These oblique shocks must be terminated by a strong normal shock, to
slow down the airﬂow to a subsonic velocity prior combustion chamber.
Figure 5.13 shows the selected intake conﬁguration together with a system of
external/internal (mixed) shock waves. The external compression part starts at the
vehicle nose and ends at the intake lip followed by the internal compression part
inside the intake.
Subsonic ramjets need simpler inlets having a simple hole in front of a divergent
duct. This would also work at slightly supersonic speeds, but a normal shock wave
will be developed at inlet and the air will choke. Thus a reasonable pressure drop
will be encountered and the inlet will be inefﬁcient.
Pressure rise in the intake simultaneously raises the air temperature. Further
diffusion is then required to get the air velocity down to a suitable level for the
combustor. Flow of air through the intake will be treated as polytropic compression
with a certain isentropic efﬁciency. Figure 5.14 shows the variation in intake
isentropic efﬁciency with the number of oblique shock waves [27]. Intakes of
subsonic ramjets are normally associated with one or multiple oblique shock
waves followed by a normal shock. While intakes for supersonic ramjet (scramjet)
engines employ only oblique shock waves that generate supersonic combustion.
Such intakes will have high efﬁciencies of the range 90þ
ð
Þ %.
Figure 5.15 shows the T-S diagram and conﬁguration of the intake between inlet
state (A) and exit state (B). The intake model is built up by the deﬁnition of
isentropic efﬁciency given by Eq. (5.16). The variation of total temperature and

5.3.3.2
Combustion Chamber (Or Burners) Module
Combustion chambers are modeled as burners within which energy is generated
through chemical reaction. Since there is no downstream turbine, a ramjet com-
bustor can safely operate at stoichiometric fuel to air ratios, which implies a
combustor exit stagnation temperature of the order of 2400 K for kerosene. Within
the combustion chamber fuel is added, mixed with a part of air, then burnt by one or
more ignitors. Remaining air quantity is used for cooling. Combustion process takes
place at nearly constant pressure. However, due to friction and fuel-air mixing, a
small drop in total pressure will take place inside the burner. The fuel burning will
be simulated as heat addition to escape the complication of chemical reaction.

Burning efﬁciency will be taken into consideration to represent unburned hydro-
carbons. According to Zucrow, burning efﬁciency was nearly 95 % in the 1940s and
1950s [28], while it reached 98 % in the 1960s and reached 99 % in the 1990s.
Concerning total pressure losses, it was 5 % in the 1960s and was improved to 2.5 %
in the 1990s.
First law of thermodynamics and continuity equation will be used to build the
burner model. Figure 5.17 shows the T-S diagram and burner’s geometry. Burner’s
governing equations are given by Eqs. (5.19) and (5.20). Figure 5.18 shows block
diagram of combustion chamber. Letters (A) and (B) are used for inlet as an outlet

Different types of fuels are used, namely:
•
Gaseous (hydrogen as an example)
•
Liquid (kerosene, synthetic hydrocarbon fuel; like US made RJ1, RJ4 and
French CSD07T, CSD15T)
•
Solid (polymers loaded with metal particles like Mg, Al, or B as examples:
polyether, polyester, polyurethane). In such solid fuel ramjet, a grain of solid
fuel gasiﬁes or ablates and reacts with air.
5.3.3.3
Nozzle Module
Nozzle is the last and the most important component in all jet engines. It converts
the pressure and thermal energy into kinetic energy of hot gases jet, which generates
the thrust. Nozzles may be of ﬁxed or varaible geometry. It also may be convergent
or convergent divergent sections. Finally, nozzles also may be choked or unchoked.
The ﬂow in nozzle is treated as polytropic expansion with a certain isentropic
efﬁciency. Typical value for nozzle efﬁciency is taken as 99 % [28]. T-S diagram
and nozzle conﬁguration of are shown in Fig. 5.19.
The nozzle model is constructed by applying the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
and the deﬁnition of isentropic efﬁciency in nozzle Eq. (5.21) between the nozzle
inlet state (A) and exit state (B). State (A) is completely deﬁned while only the
static pressure is known at state (B) (free-stream static pressure if unchoked and
sonic speed if choked). The ﬁnal form of the nozzle model is given by Eqs. (5.21)
and (5.22). Figure 5.20 illustrates a block diagram of nozzle module.

Aero-thermodynamic Analysis of Ramjet Cycle
To analyze ramjet performance, the different states of its three modules (intake,
combustion chamber, and nozzle) are deﬁned here (Fig. 5.21). Intake is located
between states (1) to (2), while combustion chamber from (2) to (4) and ﬁnally
nozzle from (4) to (6).
The cycle of events within the engine is described below (Fig. 5.22). Figure 5.22a
illustrates ideal processes, while Fig. 5.22b illustrates actual processes experiencing
losses.
State (a), stands for ambient, is far upstream of the engine. Diffusion process
takes place in part outside of the engine and in part inside the engine. The ﬁrst part
of diffusion takes place from the far upstream, state (a) to the engine entrance, state
(1). The second part of diffusion takes place inside the engine, from state (1) to state
(2), where state (2) is at the end of the diffusion section. Air then enters the
combustion chamber at subsonic speeds. This is achieved either through a strong
normal shock wave or a multiple oblique shock waves followed by a normal shock
wave. Fuel is next, injected as ﬁne droplets which mixes rapidly with the mixture
and next ignited by a spark. A “ﬂame holder” at state (3) stabilizes the ﬂame and
facilitates a good combustion process. The ﬂame holder may be of grill-type, which
provides a type of barrier to the burning mixture while allowing hot, expanding

gases to escape through the exhaust nozzle. The high-pressure air coming into the
combustion chamber keeps the burning mixture from effectively reacting toward
the intake end of the engine. Combustion raises the temperature of the mixture to
some 2000–3000 K before the products of combustion expand to high velocities in
the nozzle. Though the walls of combustion chambers cannot tolerate temperature
much above 1200 K, but they can be kept much cooler than the main ﬂuid stream by
a fuel injection pattern that leaves a shielding layer of relatively cool air next to the
walls [29]. The expansion process takes place at the third module of the engine,
namely the nozzle. Most ramjet engines now have a convergent divergent (C-D)

nozzle as it is installed to supersonic ﬂight vehicles. Expansion starts at the
convergent section between state (4) and the nozzle throat, state (5). The nozzle
has next a diverging section that ends at state (6). Sometimes state (6) is denoted by
(e) resembling the exhaust or exit condition. The nozzle accelerates the ﬂow, thus
the exit velocity is greater than the free stream velocity, and so thrust is created.
5.3.4.1
Ideal Cycle
For ideal cycle, all the processes are assumed isentropic (reversible adiabatic) and
no pressure drop will be encountered in the three modules of the engine, refer to
Fig. 5.22a.
Total pressure is constant in the whole cycle; thus
P0a ¼ P02 ¼ P04 ¼ P06
ð5:27Þ
Moreover, since neither work nor heat addition or rejection takes place in the intake
and nozzle, then from the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, equal total enthalpy (and
thus total temperature) is presumed. Thus
T0a ¼ T02
T04 ¼ T06

ð5:28Þ
Nozzle is assumed unchoked, thus a full expansion of the hot gasses within the
nozzle to ambient pressure is assumed, therefore

Real Cycle
For a real cycle, stagnation pressure drop is encountered in the all modules; intake,
combustion chamber and nozzle due to aerodynamic losses. Compression in the
diffuser and expansion in the nozzle are adiabatic. Moreover, losses occur during
combustion which is accounted for by combustion or burner efﬁciency. Fig-
ure 5.22b illustrates the effect of irreversibilties on the different processes in the
cycle. Thus stagnations pressure ratios in diffuser, combustion chamber, and nozzle
(rd, rc, rn

are respectively deﬁned as
rd ¼ P02
P0a
, rc ¼ P04
P02
, rn ¼ P06

Then the overall stagnation pressure ratio is

It will be shown here after that irreversibilities will lead to the inequality of the
ﬂight and exhaust Mach numbers. The properties (γ, R) of the ﬂuid through the
different parts of the engine are also assumed constant.

From the above derived relations, the speciﬁc thrust and thrust speciﬁc fuel
consumption (TSFC) are plotted in Fig. 5.23 for ideal and real engines. The ratio
between speciﬁc heats is assumed constantγ ¼ 1:4: The maximum temperatures
investigated areT04 ¼ 2000K or 3000K. The pressure ratios in the diffuser, com-
bustion chamber, and nozzle are respectively rd ¼ 0:7; rc ¼ 0:97; and rn ¼ 0:96.
The burner is assumed ideal ηb ¼ 1 and fuel heating value is QR ¼ 43, 000 kJ=kg.
For any given peak temperature, the thrust per unit mass ﬂow rate m
a, for real
ramjet is less than the ideal. However, the TSFC for real is higher than the ideal.
Also for real ramjet, there is a reasonably well-deﬁned minimum TSFC.

5.3.5
Nuclear Ramjet
The principle behind the nuclear ramjet was relatively simple: The three basic
components of ramjet engines are the same but a nuclear reactor is used to heat the
air instead of burning fuel in a combustion chamber. Thus additional components

Pulsejet, Ramjet, and Scramjet Engines

are used in nuclear ramjets, namely, reactor core, radiation shield, and heat
exchanger (Fig. 5.28a).
During 1950s and 1960s, there was a government program in the United States to
develop nuclear-powered ramjet engines for use in cruise missiles namely Project
Pluto. Two experimental engines were tested at the United States Department of
Energy Nevada Test Site (NTS) in 1961 and 1964. Unlike commercial reactors,
which are surrounded by concrete, the Pluto reactor had to be small and compact
enough to ﬂy, but durable enough to survive a 7000 mile (11,000 km) trip to a
potential target. The nuclear engine could, in principle, operate for months, so a
Pluto cruise missile could be left airborne for a prolonged time before being
directed to carry out its attack. For many reasons, the project started on 1 January
1957 and cancelled on 1 July 1964.
Hybrid ramjet and scramjet engine are illustrated in Fig. 5.28b. Nuclear ramjet
engine is located upstream of a scramjet engine. Exhaust of ramjet engine is pure air

at supersonic speeds which ﬂows into the intake of scramjet and next into a typical
combustion chamber where either hydrocarbon or hydrogen fuel is added and burnt.
5.3.6
Double Throat Ramjet Engine
Double throat ramjet (DTR) engine (Fig. 5.29) ﬂow stream needs to contain two
throats: the ﬁrst is to decelerate the ﬂow to subsonic ﬂow before the combustion
chamber, and the second is to accelerate the ﬂow to supersonic again in the nozzle.
Thus, DTR is composed of a supersonic-subsonic intake followed by a subsonic
combustion chamber and a subsonic-supersonic nozzle. The supersonic ﬂow in the
intake is decelerated to subsonic through either a normal shock or a number of
oblique shocks waves ended by a normal shock wave in the ﬁrst throat. Subsonic

constant pressure combustion chamber will follow. The subsonic ﬂow leaving the
combustion chamber is accelerated to supersonic speed in a convergent divergent
nozzle (incorporating the second throat). The main parameters affecting the engine
performance is the amount of heat added per unit mass of air passing through the
engine, which can be calculated from the fuel-to-air ratio in the engine.
Figure 5.29 shows the engine conﬁguration, and Fig. 5.30 shows the T.S diagram
of ramjet engine.

Scramjet
5.4.1
Introduction
A scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) is a variant of a ramjet airbreathing jet
engine in which combustion takes place in supersonic airﬂow [30–32]. Thus, the
airﬂow through the whole engine remains supersonic. Due to the nature of its
design, scramjet operation is limited to near-hypersonic velocities. Thus, a
scramjet-powered vehicle must be accelerated to the required velocity by some
other means of propulsion, such as turbojet, rail gun, or rocket engines. In the ﬂight
of the experimental scramjet-powered Boeing X-51A, the test craft was lifted to
ﬂight altitude by a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress before being released and accelerated
by a detachable rocket to near Mach 5.1 for 210 s on 1 May 2013 for the longest
duration hypersonic ﬂight [30, 31].
Scramjet like ramjet is also composed of three basic components, namely: inlet
(or intake), combustor and nozzle. While scramjets are conceptually simple, actual
implementation is limited by extreme technical challenges:

double-throat ramjet engine

Pulsejet, Ramjet, and Scramjet Engines

1. Only limited testing can be performed in ground facilities. Long duration, full-
scale testing requires ﬂight test speeds above Mach 6.
2. Hypersonic ﬂight within the atmosphere generates immense drag, and temper-
atures (heat barrier) found on the aircraft and within the engine [2, 3]
3. Maintaining combustion in the supersonic, as the fuel must be injected, mixed,
ignited, and burned within milliseconds [33].
Two families of operational application can be seen for high-speed air-breathing
propulsion, namely:
•
Combined airbreathing/rocket propulsion for space launcher
•
Military systems, mainly missiles and drone
Aerospace industries follow now the motto of “The sky is no longer the limit.”
Concerning ﬂight speeds or Mach numbers, scramjet engines are employed for
Mach numbers greater than 5.0, ramjet engines are used for a Mach number range
of (0.5–5.5), while turbine-based engines are installed to vehicles ﬂying at Mach
numbers up to 3.0 [34].
5.4.2
Evolution of Scramjets
The evolution of the scramjet engine started in the 1940s is elegantly reviewed in
several articles including those by John Bertin [34], Rife and Cantelon [35],
Hallion’s report [36], Waltrup et al. [37] Curran [38], and Segal [39]. These
developments will be quickly highlighted here below
•
In 1940s, research and development (R&D) in different institutions in USA and
Canada began to develop scramjet powered ﬂights. [37].
•
In 1944, Swithenbank and McGill University, Canada, published early work on
scramjet inlets, fuel injection, combustion, and nozzles focusing on hypersonic
ﬂight Mach numbers of between 10 and 25.
•
In the 1950s and 1960s, a variety of experimental scramjet engines were built
and ground tested in the USA and the UK.
•
In 1957, Avery and Dugger started an analytical and experimental study of
scramjet engines and their potential [38].
•
In 1958, Weber and MacKay published an analysis on the feasibility, beneﬁts,
and technical challenges to scramjet powered ﬂight (Mach 4–7).
•
In 1964, Dr. Frederick S. Billig and Dr. Gordon L. Dugger submitted a patent
application for a scramjet that was based on Billig’s PhD thesis. This patent was
issued in 1981 following the removal of an order of secrecy.
•
In the 1980s, the National Aero-space Plane (X-30) project envisioned a single
stage to orbit (SSTO) airplane, which could take off and land horizontally. The
plane’s engine was a scramjet engine powered by hydrogen. However, the
project was canceled in 1993.

Scramjet

•
In 1981, experimental scramjets were made and tested in Australia under the
guidance of Professor Ray Stalker in the T3 ground test facility at Australia’s
national university (ANU).
•
In 1991, the ﬁrst successful ﬂight test of a scramjet was performed by Russia. It
was an axisymmetric hydrogen-fueled dual-mode scramjet developed by Central
Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM), Moscow, in the late 1970s. The scramjet
ﬂight was ﬂown captive-carry atop the SA-5 surface-to-air missile that included
an experiment ﬂight support unit known as the “Hypersonic Flying Laboratory”
(HFL), Kholod [40].
•
From 1992 to 1998, an additional six ﬂight tests of the axisymmetric high-speed
scramjet-demonstrator were conducted by CIAM together with France and then
with NASA, USA. Maximum ﬂight velocity greater than Mach 6.4 was achieved
and Scramjet operation during 77 s was demonstrated. These ﬂight test series
also provided insight into autonomous hypersonic ﬂight controls.
•
In 2000 and 2001, the AFRL and P&W ground tested the ﬁrst uncooled liquid
hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet performance test engine (PTE) at simulated ﬂight
Mach numbers of 4.5 and 6.5 in 2000 and 2001 [41]. This was followed by the
ﬁrst successful ground test of a ﬂight-weight, fuel-cooled scramjet engine at the
same ﬂight conditions in 2003.
•
In the interval 2001–2006, the Australian project (HyShot) of The University of
Queensland, Australia, demonstrated the possibility of supersonic combustion of
scramjet engines [42]. Two stage Terrier- Orion Mk70 rocket carrying a scramjet
engine in its nosecone. The ﬁrst successful launch (Hyshot II) was of a University
of Queensland scramjet on 30 July 2002. A second successful ﬂight (HyShot III)
using a QinetiQ scramjet was achieved on 25 March 2006. The later QinetiQ
prototype is cylindrical with four stainless steel combustors around the outside.
The HyShot IV ﬂight on 30 March 2006 launched successfully. The scramjet
engine of HyShot project was not designed to provide thrust to propel a craft.
•
In 2004 and making use of the research and development for the X-30, the X-43
hydrogen-fueled hypersonic research aircraft succeeded in its ﬂight test. The
X-43 was designed and built to be an unmanned system [41]. A Pegasus booster
launched from a B-52 was used to achieve to the correct altitude and speed prior
to igniting the X-43 scramjet engine (Fig. 5.31). Thus, the X-43A was able to
reach and maintain a record speed of Mach 9.68 at 112,000 ft.
•
On 27 May 2010, NASA and the United States Air Force successfully ﬂew the
X-51A Waverider for approximately 200 s at Mach 5, setting a new world record
hypersonic airspeed. The Waverider ﬂew autonomously before losing accelera-
tion for an unknown reason and destroying itself as planned. The test was
declared a success. The X-51A was carried aboard a B-52, accelerated to
Mach 4.5 via a solid rocket booster, and then ignited the Pratt & Whitney
Rocketdyne scramjet engine to reach Mach 5 at 70,000 ft.
•
In May 2013, X-51A reached “4828 km/h” (Mach 5.1) during 210 s ﬂight under
scramjet power.
•
Other hypersonic programs [43] are available in Germany, India [44], and
Brazil [45].

Advantages and Disadvantages of Scramjets
(A) Advantages
1. Does not have to carry oxygen
2. No rotating parts makes it easier to manufacture
3. Has a higher speciﬁc impulse (change in momentum per unit of propellant) than
a conventional engine; could provide between 1000 and 4000 s, while a rocket
only provides 600 s or less
4. Higher speed could mean cheaper access to outer space in the future
(B) Disadvantages
1. Cannot produce efﬁcient thrust unless boosted to high speed, around Mach 5. For
a horizontal take-off, scramjet would need either a rocket or combined propul-
sion systems like turbojet/turbofan to boost it to Mach numbers (2–3) followed
by another propulsion method like ramjets or rockets.
2. Testing scramjet designs use extremely expensive hypersonic test chambers or
expensive launch vehicles, both of which lead to high instrumentation costs.
Launched test vehicles very typically end with destruction of the test item and
instrumentation.
3. Lack of stealth as the vehicle would be very hot due to its high speed within the
atmosphere and it would be easy to be detected with infrared sensors
4. The increased cooling requirements of scramjet engines result in lower efﬁciency.
5.4.4
Aero-Thermodynamic Analysis of Scramjets
Scramjet engine is similar to ramjet engine while having supersonic combustion to
overcome the overheating problems –thermal barrier – that appear when

decelerating high Mach number ﬂow to subsonic ﬂow. The model for scramjet
engine (Fig. 5.32) is composed of supersonic-supersonic intake followed by a
constant area supersonic combustion chamber and a divergent nozzle. The ﬂow
will not go through chocking or critical conditions to prevent ﬂow deceleration. The
parameters affecting the cycle performance are the burner Mach number, the air
mass ﬂow rate, and the fuel mass ﬂow rate. The thermodynamic behavior is
illustrated by the T-S diagram as shown in Fig. 5.33.
Different states on the engine and T-s diagram are described as follows:
Station 1: Represents the inlet of the intake which is also the beginning of
compression process. Since the hypersonic shock-wave angles are small, the
ramps (in 2-D inlets) or spikes (for axisymmetric conﬁgurations) are long. In
many of the suggested conﬁgurations, shock waves begin at the vehicle’s leading
edge. Additional compression takes place inside the inlet duct.

Station 2: Represents the combustion chamber entrance. In a ﬁxed-geometry
scramjet, the pressure at the combustion chamber entrance varies over a large range.
Station 3: Represents the combustion chamber exit and the beginning of
expansion.
Station 4: Represents the exit from the nozzle; because of the large expansion
ratios, the entire aft part of the vehicle may be part of the engine nozzle.

Intake
The ﬂow through intake is modeled as variable area supersonic adiabatic ﬂow with
isentropic efﬁciency. The Mach number at intake is used as cycle parameter and is
used to obtain contraction ratio through the intake, pressure, and temperuture
leaving the intake. Deﬁnition of Intake isentropic compression efﬁciency is stated
in Eq. (5.44) and Fig. 5.33. The intake output parameters are calculated using
Eqs. (5.45), (5.46), and (5.47).

Dual-Mode Combustion Engine (Dual Ram-Scramjet)
5.4.6.1
Introduction
Dual-mode ramjet (DRM), which is also identiﬁed as dual-mode scramjets, is a
ramjet that operates as ramjet at low supersonic speeds and transforms into a
scramjet at high Mach numbers. It normally operates in the lower hypersonic
regime between Mach 4 and 8. In ramjet operations, air ﬂow needs to contain two

Pulsejet, Ramjet, and Scramjet Engines

throats: the ﬁrst is to decelerate the ﬂow to subsonic ﬂow before the combustion
chamber, and the second is to accelerate the ﬂow to supersonic again in the nozzle.
For a scramjet, these two throats are no longer needed. Thus, a complicated control
system is needed to modify scramjet geometry to match ﬂight speed requirements.
Aerodynamists suggested a simpler solution, namely, adding a short duct between
the inlet and the combustor known as an isolator [46] and keeping the other engine

ratio

geometry unchanged. The isolator is a constant area duct that can maintain normal
or oblique shock trains (Figs. 5.37 and 5.38). The main concern in the isolator is that
the shock pattern that occurs during subsonic combustion operation does not reach
the inlet since this condition can cause the engine to unstart. For high supersonic
ﬂight Mach numbers (and correspondingly high combustor Mach numbers), the
boundary layers in the isolator will be very thin and no waves of any importance
will form in the isolator [47]. The shock train formed in the isolator and its
performance depends on the back pressure acting on it and the isolator height to
length ratio which is a new parameter affecting the system. Other components are
treated the same as in scramjet. The T-s diagram of dual ram-scramjet engine are
shown in Fig. 5.39. Static states are dispayed in Fig. 5.39a, while total and static
states are shown in Fig. 5.39b for both ideal and real processes.

Station 1 is downstream of the vehicle forebody shock and represents the properties
of the ﬂow that enters the inlet.
Station 2 is at the inlet throat, which is usually the minimum area of the ﬂow path,
and the isolator extends between stations 2 and 3.
Station 3 represents the start of the combustor, where fuel and air is mixed and
burned.
Station 4 represents the end of the combustor.
Station 5 represents the end of expansion process, which includes an internal
expansion within the nozzle and an external expansion to the end of the vehicle.
(A) Intake
The intake is modeled as adiabatic supersonic ﬂow with adiabatic compression
efﬁciency. The governing equations are same as listed in scramjet; Eqs. (5.44),
(5.45), (5.46), (5.47), (5.48).
(B) Isolator
The isolator behavior will be governed by Eq. (5.60) that relates isolator outlet
pressure ratio to its dimensions, inlet Mach number, and boundry layer parameters
at inlet [27]. In Eq. (5.63), L/Hare isolator dimensions according to Fig. 5.38, θ is
the momentum thickness at isolator inlet, and Rθ is the Renoldes number related to
momentum thickness. The maximum presure ratio that can take place in duct
module with no enery addition or subtraction will be equal to the pressure ratio
through a normal shock wave. So the pressure ratio in the isolator will be limited to
Eq. (5.64). The ﬂow in the isolator will be treated also as adiabatic supersonic ﬂow
with adiabatic compression efﬁciency deﬁned by Eq. (5.65) and Fig. 5.39a. The
combustion inlet temperature and Mach number can be calculated through
Eqs. (5.66) and (5.67).

ﬂow and energy Eqs. (5.68), (5.69), (5.70).

Conclusion
In this chapter, three types of athodyd engines, namely pulsejet, ramjet, and scramjet,
are discussed. These engines cover the whole ﬂight domain starting from subsonic to
hypersonic speeds. Historical review for the three types is reviewed. The ﬁrst engine
discussed is pulsejet engine. Starting by its ﬁrst version dates back to the thirties/
forties of the last century and ending by its new version, pulse detonation engine
(PDE), all thermodynamic and propulsive analyses are given.
Next, ramjet engine is handled. Both subsonic and supersonic types as well as
single-throat and double-throat types are discussed. Moreover, its aircraft and
missile applications are discussed with numerous examples for each. Nuclear
types are also described.
Finally, scramjet engines are discussed. Thermodynamic analysis of both single-
and dual-mode is given.

5.8 A ramjet traveling in level ﬂight at an altitude of 20,000 m with a constant
speed of 540 m/s. The intake conditions have been simpliﬁed to represent the
formation of a normal shock wave immediately at the inlet. It is assumed that
the pressure external to the engine is everywhere that of the ambient atmo-
sphere. Moreover, the ﬂow is isentropic through inlet (intake) and nozzle is
assumed isentropic. Combustion process occurs through the addition of fuel

Turbine-Based Engines: Turbojet, Turbofan,
and Turboramjet Engines
6.1
Introduction
Turbine-based cycle engines (or gas turbine) together with athodyd engines repre-
sent the two main categories of reaction engines; refer to Fig. 4.1. Athodyd engines
are analyzed in Chap. 5, while gas turbine engines will be analyzed in this chapter.
The main difference between athodyd and turbine engines is the presence of
turbomachines or rotating modules in turbine engines. There are ﬁve main types
of gas turbine engines; namely: turbojet, turbofan, advanced ducted fan, turbo-ram,
and turbo-rocket. In this chapter only three engines will be treated, namely,
turbojet, turbofan, and turboramjet engines. Turbo-rocket engines will be analyzed
in late chapters handling rockets.
Aircraft designers have always been limited by the efﬁciency of the available
power plants. Their constant endeavor is to achieve higher thrust, lower
fuel
consumption,
less
weight,
smaller
frontal
area,
and
better
cooling
characteristics [1].
Both piston engine and gas turbine engine are internal combustion engines. In
both, air is compressed, fuel added, and the mixture ignited, and the rapid expansion
of the resultant hot gas produces the power or thrust. However, combustion in a
piston engine is intermittent, and the expanding gas produces shaft power through a
piston and crank shaft arrangements, Chap. 4, whereas in a jet engine combustion is
continuous and its power results from expanding gas being forced out of the rear of
the engine as described in Chap. 5 and the present chapter.
Jet engines overcome the many drawbacks of piston engines particularly for
higher-power engines. Comparison between turbine and reciprocating (piston)
engines having the same power will be given hereafter [2].
Advantages of gas turbines over piston engines are:
Turbine engines have higher-power-to-weight ratio.
Turbine engines need less maintenance per ﬂying hour.
Turbine engines have less frontal area and consequently less drag force.

Turbine engines do not need any oil dilution or engine preheating before starting.
Turbine engines have lower rates of oil consumption.
Advantages of piston engines over gas turbines are:
Piston engines are less exposed to foreign object damage.
Piston engines have faster acceleration rates compared to turbine engines.
Piston engines have less operating temperature.
Piston engines have lower fuel consumption specially for low ﬂight speeds.
Piston engines have much less initial costs compared to turbine engines.
6.2
Turbojet
6.2.1
Introduction
The turbojet is the basic engine of the jet age. It resembles the simplest form of gas
turbine. It was separately coinvented by the two fathers of jet engines: Frank
Whittle from Britain and von Ohain from Germany. The ﬁrst airplane powered
by a turbojet engine was the He178 German aircraft powered by the He S-3 engine
on August 27, 1939. Based on von Ohain work, the German engine Junker Jumo
004 was later developed. It was the world’s ﬁrst turbojet engine in production and
operational use as well as the ﬁrst successful axial compressor jet engine ever built.
Some 8000 units were manufactured by Junkers in Germany during late World War
II which powered several aircrafts including Messerschmitt Me 262 jet ﬁghter,
Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance/bomber, and prototypes of the Horten Ho 229.
Frank Whittle in England having no knowledge of Ohain’s engine built his W.1
turbojet engine which powered the Gloster E28/39 aircraft. Turbojets are rarely
ﬂying today due its disadvantage of high noise levels and drastic fuel consumption.
Examples for the still ﬂying turbojets powering civil transports are GE CJ610-
Learjet 25 series, P&W JT12 Sabre 40, and JetStar Dash 8. Turbojet engines still
power old military ﬁghters, cruise and antiship missiles, as well as turboramjet
engines. Examples for cruise missiles are AGM-109C/H/I/J/K/L and Microturbo
TRI 60, while 3M-54 Klub is an example for antiship missiles and J58 turboramjet
engine powering SR-71 aircraft.
As described in Chap. 5, both ramjet and scramjet engines cannot develop
takeoff thrust. To overcome this disadvantage, a compressor is installed in the
inlet duct so that even at zero ﬂight speed, air could be drawn into the engine. This
compressor is driven by the turbine installed downstream of the combustion
chamber and connected to the compressor by a central shaft. Addition of these
two rotating parts or modules (compressor and turbine) converts the ramjet into a
turbojet. The three successive modules, compressor, combustion chamber, and
turbine, constitute what is called gas generator (Fig. 6.1). The air is squeezed in
the compressor to many times its normal atmospheric pressure and then forced into
the combustion chamber. Fuel is sprayed into the compressed air, ignited, and
burnt continuously in the combustion chamber. This raises the temperature of the
404

Turbine-Based Engines: Turbojet, Turbofan, and Turboramjet Engines

ﬂuid mixture to about 600–800  C. The resulting burning gases expand rapidly
rearward and pass through the turbine, which drives the compressor. The turbine
extracts energy from the expanding gases to drive the compressor. If the turbine and
compressor are efﬁcient, the pressure at the turbine discharge will be nearly twice
the atmospheric pressure, and this excess pressure is sent to the nozzle to produce a
high-velocity stream of gases. These gases bounce back and shoot out of the rear of
the exhaust, thus producing a thrust propelling the plane. This ﬁve-module engine
(intake, compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, and nozzle) is identiﬁed as a
single-spool turbojet engine.
Substantial increases in thrust can be obtained by employing an afterburner or an
augmenter. It is a second combustion chamber positioned between the turbine and

the nozzle, which is normally employed in military aircrafts. Moreover, for civil
transport, the thrust force may be increased by adding a second spool (or a second
set of compressor–turbine combination). Figure 6.1 illustrates two layouts for a
single-spool turbojet using either an axial or centrifugal compressors while a third
layout for a double-spool engine.
Classiﬁcation of turbojet engines [1] is shown in Fig. 6.2. Turbojet engines may
be a nuclear or nonnuclear engine. In the late 1940s and through the 1950s [3],
preliminary work was done on developing nuclear-powered rockets and jet engines.
In nuclear turbojet engine, a liquid metal is heated by the reactor which passes
through a heat exchanger in the combustion chamber.
Both US and USSR nuclear programs developed the American “Crusader”
NB-36, version of
B-36 [4], as well as the Russian Tupolev Tu-95 LAL [5]. Both programs were
ultimately cancelled due to technical difﬁculties and growing safety concerns as
catastrophic atomic radiation might be encountered in case of crashes/accidents of
such nuclear airplanes.

Other
classiﬁcations
for
turbojet
engines
may
be
afterburning
or
non-afterburning. Afterburning (or reheat) is a method of augmenting the basic
thrust of an engine to improve the aircraft takeoff, climb, and (for military aircraft)
combat performance.
Afterburner is another combustion chamber added between the turbine and the
nozzle that utilizes the unburnt oxygen in the exhaust gas to support combustion.
The increase in the temperature of the exhaust gas increases the velocity of the
exhaust gases leaving the nozzle and therefore increases the engine thrust by 40 %
at takeoff and a much larger percentage at high speeds once the plane is in the air.
A third classiﬁcation of the turbojet engines is based on their number of spools.
Turbojets may be single- or two (sometimes identiﬁed as double or dual)-spool
engines. A single-spool turbojet has one shaft with a compressor and a turbine
mounted at either shaft ends, while a two-spool engine has two concentric shafts as
well as two compressors and turbines. The ﬁrst compressor next to the intake is
identiﬁed as the low-pressure compressor (LPC) which is driven by the
low-pressure turbine (LPT). Both together with their shaft are denoted as the
low-pressure spool. The high-pressure compressor (HPC) is situated downstream
of the low-pressure compressor. Also this compressor is driven by the high-pressure
turbine (HPT). Both are coupled by the high-pressure shaft (which is concentric
with the low-pressure shaft) and constitute the modules of the high-pressure spool.
Figure 6.1 illustrates the layout and modules of the single- and double-spool
turbojet engines.
The single-spool engine may be further classiﬁed based on the type of compres-
sor employed. The compression section may be composed of either a single or
double compressors. Moreover, the compressor may be of the axial or centrifugal
(radial) type. A single axial or centrifugal compressor is seen in some turbojets. In
other cases two compressors assembled in series are found. These compressors may
be either two centrifugal compressors or an axial compressor followed by a
centrifugal compressor.
Lastly, this classiﬁcation closes by the type of entry associated with the two
centrifugal compressors case. Centrifugal compressors may have either a single or
double entries if they were assembled in a back-to-back conﬁguration.

6.2.3
Thermodynamic Cycle Analysis of a Single Spool
Single-spool turbojet engine is composed of ﬁve modules, namely, intake (or inlet),
compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, and nozzle. Afterburning turbojet
6.2
Turbojet

incorporates a sixth module, namely, afterburner. Intake, combustion chamber,
afterburner (if included), and nozzle are stationary elements, whereas compressor
and turbine are rotating elements. Generally, in aero engines and gas turbines, two
types of compressors and two types of turbines are found. These are the centrifugal
and axial ﬂow compressors (which will be analyzed in Chap. 9) and radial and axial
turbines (will be analyzed in Chap. 10). Centrifugal compressor was used in both ﬁrst
engines of von Ohain and Whittle. The axial ﬂow type has several stages of alternate
rotating and stationary airfoil blades which can achieve compression ratios in excess
of 40:1. Axial turbine consists of one or more stages of alternate stationary and
rotating airfoil-section blades. The turbine extracts energy from the hot exhaust gases
to drive the compressor. Radial turbines are found in small gas turbines like APU.
The characteristics of the engine that must be known in advance are ﬂight speed
(or Mach number), ﬂight altitude, compressor pressure ratio, turbine inlet temper-
ature (TIT) and maximum temperature of the cycle (if the afterburner is operative),
type of nozzle (convergent or convergent–divergent), and fuel lowest heating value.
Percentage of bled air as well as the power delivered to drive accessories and any
aircraft systems must be also speciﬁed. Component efﬁciencies of all modules and
pressure drops in stationary modules (inlet, combustor, and afterburner) must also
be known. When the cycle is assumed ideal, then all efﬁciencies are assumed unity
(or hundred percent) and all pressure drops are assumed zeros.
Figure 6.3 illustrates a layout with its designation points (Fig. 6.3a) as well as
thermodynamic cycle (T-s diagram) for a single-spool turbojet with inoperative
afterburner (Fig. 6.3b) and with operative afterburner (Fig. 6.3c).
The cycle different processes are described here:
–(1): air ﬂows from far upstream (where the velocity of air relative to engine is the
ﬂight velocity) up to the intake, usually with some deceleration during cruise and
acceleration during takeoff (the process is always ideal where: h0a ¼ h01).
(1)–(2): air ﬂows through the inlet (or intake) and ducting system up to the
compressor inlet. Since this element is always considered as a diffuser, the air
velocity is decreased.
(2)–(3): air is compressed in a dynamic compressor.
(3)–(4): air is heated by mixing and burring of fuel within the combustion chamber.
(4)–(5): products of combustion are expanded through a turbine to obtain power to
drive the compressor.
(5)–(6): gases may or may not be further heated if the afterburner is operative or
inoperative.
(6)–(7): gases are accelerated and exhausted through the exhaust nozzle.
If the engine is not ﬁtted with afterburner, then states 5 and 6 are coincident. The
amount of mass ﬂow is usually set by ﬂow choking in the nozzle throat.
The following remarks may be listed:
1. All components are irreversible but they are adiabatic (except burners); thus,
isentropic efﬁciencies for the intake, compressor, turbine, and nozzle are
employed.

2. Friction in the air intake (or diffuser) reduces the total pressure from its free-
stream value and increases its entropy. At the intake outlet, the total temperature
is higher than the isentropic case, while the total pressure is smaller than the
isentropic case which depends on the intake or diffuser efﬁciency (ηd).
Depending
on
ﬂight Mach
number,
the
diffuser
efﬁciency
ranges
as
(0.7 < ηd < 0.9). The speciﬁc heat ratio (γ ¼ 1.4). More details about intakes
will be given in Chap. 8.
3. The compression of the air in the compressor increases temperature, pressure,
and entropy due to irreversibilities of this process. Such increase in temperature
depends on the compressor efﬁciency (ηc) which ranges from 0.85 to 0.90, while
the speciﬁc heat ratio (γ ¼ 1.37). A portion of the compressed air is utilized in
cooling the turbine disks, blades, and the supporting bearings through an air
bleed system. Thus, the air mass ﬂow rate in the succeeding modules is some-
what smaller than that entering the compressor.
4. The burners are not simple heaters and the chemical composition of the working
ﬂuid changes during combustion process. The larger the fuel-to-air ratio ( f ) the
greater is the deviation in the chemical composition of the products of combus-
tion from that of the air. Losses in the combustion process are encountered due to
many factors including imperfect combustion, physical characteristics of the
fuel, as well as thermal losses due to conduction and radiation. Such losses are
handled by introducing the burner efﬁciency (ηb), where: 0.97 < ηb  0.99.
Pressure drop due to skin friction and pressure drag in the combustors (normally
3–6 % of the total pressure of the entering air) must be also taken into account.
5. The expansion process in turbine is very nearly adiabatic. However, due to
friction an increase in the entropy is encountered. Moreover, the outlet temper-
ature is higher than that of the isentropic case. Thus, the available power from
the turbine is less than that in the isentropic case. The expansion process is
associated with the turbine efﬁciency (ηt), where: 0.90 < ηt < 0.95 and speciﬁc
heat ratio. The speciﬁc heat ratio (γ ¼ 1.33).
6. The afterburner is similar to the burner. This added fuel is much greater than that
added in combustion chamber (burner). Losses in the afterburner are also due to
imperfect combustion and thermal losses due to conduction and radiation. Such
losses are handled by introducing the burner efﬁciency (ηab), where:
0.97 < ηab  0.99. Also a total pressure drop is encountered ranging between
3 and 6 %.
7. Finally, the expansion process in the nozzle is similar to that in the turbine and
inﬂuenced by skin friction. It is also governed by the adiabatic efﬁciency (ηn),
where: 0.95 < ηn < 0.98. The speciﬁc heat ratio γ ¼ 1.36
It is here worth mentioning that air/gas velocities within the gas generator is
ignored. The velocities at the inlet to intake and outlet of nozzle are only calculated.
The different processes through the engine modules are described again here.
1. Intake
During cruise, the static pressure rises from (a) to (1) outside the intake and from
(1) to (2) inside the intake. The air is decelerated relative to the engine. Since the
410
6
Turbine-Based Engines: Turbojet, Turbofan, and Turboramjet Engines

velocity at (2) is assumed to be zero and the deceleration is adiabatic, then the total
or stagnation pressure at states (0) and (1) are equal and greater than its value at
state (2).
The stagnation temperatures for states (a), (1), and (2) are equal and independent
from any losses:

given. The outlet pressure will be given by:

2. Compressor
From state (2) to (3), an irreversible adiabatic compression process takes place,
which is associated with the isentropic efﬁciency of the compressor (ηc). Thus, with
known pressure ratio (πC), the pressure and temperature at the outlet of the
compressor are evaluated from the relations:

3. Combustion chamber
In combustion process, fuel is injected in an atomized form, evaporated, and
mixed with air. Spark plugs initiate the combustion process. The mass ﬂow rate of
the burnt fuel is calculated from the energy balance of the combustion chamber:
_ma þ _mf


Cph T04 ¼ _maCpcT03 þ ηb _m f QR
6.2
Turbojet
411

The temperature at the outlet of the combustors (inlet of turbine) is determined from
metallurgical limits set by the turbine blade material and is known as the turbine
inlet temperature (TIT 
 T04) or turbine entry temperature (TET).
With
f ¼ _mf = _ma
then the fuel-to-air ratio is determined from the relation:
f ¼ CphT04  CpcT03
ηbQR  CphT04
ð6:6Þ
The stagnation pressure at the outlet of combustion chamber, state (4), is less than
its value at the inlet, state (3), because of ﬂuid friction. The pressure drop is either
given as a deﬁnite value or as a percentage. Thus, the outlet pressure from the
combustion chamber is expressed either as:
P04 ¼ P03  ΔPcc
ð6:7aÞ
or
P04 ¼ P03 1  ΔPcc%
ð
Þ
ð6:7bÞ
4. Turbine
The power consumed in the compressor is supplied by the turbine. If the ratio of
the power needed to drive the compressor to the power available in the turbine is
(λ), then the energy balance for the compressor–turbine shaft is:
Wc ¼ ηm λ Wt
Here (λ) is of the range 75–85 %. Thus, 15–25 % of the turbine power is used in
driving accessories, different actuators in the aircraft systems/cycles. The mechan-
ical efﬁciency (ηm) is equal or greater than 98 %. Thus, in terms of the temperature
differences:

5. Afterburner
If the jet engine is without an afterburner, then no work or heat transfer occurs
downstream of turbine, station (5). The stagnation enthalpy remains constant
throughout the rest of engine. However, if there is an afterburner, we have two
cases; either the afterburner is operative or inoperative.
(a)
Inoperative afterburner
If the afterburner is inoperative (Fig. 6.3b), no further fuel is burnt, and the
stagnation (total) temperature at states (5) and (6) is equal or:
T06 ¼ T05
ð6:10Þ
Concerning the total pressure, a similar treatment to the combustion chamber is
considered. Thus, based on the value of the pressure drop within the afterburner due
to the skin friction and the drag from the ﬂameholders:
P06 ¼ P05  ΔPab
ð6:11aÞ
Or :
P06 ¼ P05 1  ΔPab%
ð
Þ
ð6:11bÞ
(b) Operative afterburner
For operative afterburner (Fig. 6.3c), a subscript (A) is added to the symbols of
the temperature and the pressure to denote operative afterburner. In this case an
additional amount of fuel is burnt which raises the temperature to (T06A):
T06A ¼ TMAX
ð6:12Þ
6.2
Turbojet
413

It may be higher than the turbine inlet temperature (TIT). The reason for such a
higher temperature is that the downstream element is the nozzle, which is a
nonrotating part. Thus, the walls are subjected only to thermal stresses rather than
the combined thermal and mechanical stresses as in the turbine(s). The pressure at
the outlet of the afterburner will be also less than its value at the inlet. It is
calculated using Eq. (6.11a) and (6.11b) but P06A replaces P06. Conservation of
mass and energy are discussed with reference to Fig. 6.4.
There is an additional fuel quantity ( _m fab) added and burnt in the afterburner.
Then conservation of mass within the afterburner is expressed by:
_m6 ¼ _m5 þ _m fab
Conservation of energy yields:

The critical pressure is then compared with the ambient pressure. If it is greater or
equal to the ambient pressure, then the nozzle is choked (M7 ¼ 1). This means that
P7 ¼ Pc and the nozzle outlet temperature (T7) is then calculated from the relation:

P7 ¼ Pa, and the exhaust gases are determined from the relation:

For inoperative afterburner, the same Eqs. (6.21) and (6.22) are used, but the
afterburner fuel-to-air ratio fab is set equal to zero.
6.2.5
Important Deﬁnitions
Designers and operators of aero engines normally use the below deﬁnitions in their
daily work.
(A) Exhaust gas temperature gauge (EGT)
Exhaust gas temperature is measured with a thermocouple-type pyrometer. By
monitoring EGT, the pilot can get an idea of the engine’s air-fuel ratio. At a
stoichiometric fuel-to-air ratio, the exhaust gas temperature is different than that
in a lean or rich fuel-to-air ratio. High temperatures (typically above 900 C) can be
an indicator of dangerous conditions that can lead to catastrophic engine failure.
(B) Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR)
Engine pressure ratio (EPR) is the ratio of turbine discharge to compressor inlet
pressure. EPR is used as an indication of the amount of thrust being developed by a
turbine engine. An engine pressure ratio (EPR) gauge is used to indicate the power
output of turbojet (and turbofan) engines. Pressure measurements are recorded by
probes installed in the engine inlet and at the exhaust. Once collected, the data is
sent to a differential pressure transducer, which is indicated on a ﬂight deck EPR
gauge. EPR system design automatically compensates for the effects of airspeed
and altitude. Changes in ambient temperature require a correction be applied to
EPR indications to provide accurate engine power settings
(C) Bleed
Bleed air in aircraft engine is a compressed air that can be taken from within the
engine, most often after the compressor stage(s) but before the fuel is injected in the
burners. Bleed air has high temperature and high pressure (typical values are
200–250 C and 275 kPa). This compressed air is used in aircraft in many different
ways, deicing of wing leading edge, pressurizing the cabin, pneumatic actuators,
starting the remaining engines, and pressurizing lavatory water storage tanks.
Moreover, it is used in deicing of engine intake and cooling of turbine blades.
Example 6.1 A single-spool turbojet engine powers a military aircraft ﬂying with a
Mach number (M) at an altitude where the ambient temperature is (Ta). The
compressor pressure ratio is (π) and the turbine inlet total temperature is (T04).
Assuming all the processes are ideal, constant air/gas properties (γ, Cp) and constant
(T04), and ( f  0), prove that the maximum thrust force is obtained when:

Example 6.5 A civil transport aircraft powered by four turbojet engines is ﬂying at

overall pressure ratio is 20 and the maximum temperature is 1500 K. Due to an
ingested bird, one engine failed and the aircraft ﬂew by three engines at the same
altitude and Mach number. The pilot advanced the throttle lever to increase the rate
of fuel ﬂow and thus the turbine inlet temperature. This led to an increase in exhaust
gas velocity to compensate for the thrust of the failed engine. The thrust force of the
operative engines was thus increased. Calculate:
The original and ﬁnal exhaust speeds
The new maximum total temperature
Fuel-to-air ratio in both cases (fuel heating value is 42,000 kJ/kg)
Assume that:
All processes are ideal
Constant speciﬁc heats and speciﬁc heat ratio at all engine modules, such that

(52.3 %).
The maximum temperature (turbine inlet) increased from 1500 K to 1938 K
(29.2 %), which most probably led to a turbine overheat.

Practically, pilots normally follow other procedures, among which the ﬂight
altitude and speed are reduced which reduce the drag force. Thus, the thrust
generated by each engine in the second case is close to its value prior engine
failure. In this case the maximum temperature may be kept within the range of
100–110 % of its original value.
6.2.6
Double-Spool Turbojet
The two-spool (or double-spool) engines are composed of two compressors coupled
to two turbines through two shafts (or spools) (Fig. 6.8a). Double-spool engines are
designed to fulﬁll the high-thrust requirements for both military and civil aircrafts.
The ﬁrst spool is composed of the low-pressure compressor (LPC) located down-
stream the intake. It is coupled and driven by the low-pressure turbine (LPT)
located upstream of the nozzle or afterburner (if ﬁtted). The second spool is
composed of the high-pressure compressor (HPC) located downstream of the
LPC and upstream of the combustion chamber. This HPC is driven by the high-
pressure turbine (HPT) installed downstream of the combustion chamber and
upstream of the LPT. Low-pressure spool rotates at speed (N1) while high-pressure
spool rotates at a higher speed (N2). Also two-spool turbojet may be ﬁtted with
afterburner as shown in Fig. 6.8a. Afterburner is located downstream the LPT and
upstream of the nozzle. Most afterburning turbojet engines are ﬁtted to military
airplanes. Only supersonic transports (Concorde and Tu-144) are powered
afterburning turbojet engines, namely, Rolls-Royce/SNECMA Olympus 593 Mk
610 and Kolesov RD-36-51 engines. Moreover, afterburning turbojets employ
variable area intake and nozzle.
It may be concluded that two-spool turbojet engines may be composed of seven
or eight modules. These are intake, two compressors, combustion chamber, two
turbines, and a nozzle. For afterburning engines, the eighth module is the
afterburner.
6.2.7
Thermodynamic Analysis of Double-Spool Turbojet
Real (nonideal) case will be considered here, as the ideal performance can be
considered as a special case where the efﬁciencies are set equal to unity and no
pressure losses. Modules of two-spool turbojet engine were listed above.
Intake is identical to the case of single-spool turbojet. Thus, Eqs. (6.1), (6.2), and
(6.3) are used and no need to be repeated here. Now the successive elements (LPC
through nozzle) will be examined.

Micro-turbojet
Small turbojet engine are developed for use in cruise missiles, target drones, and
other small unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). Examples are Microturbo TRI
60 which different types (TRI 60-1, 60-2, 60-3, 60-5, 60-20, and 60-30) produce
a thrust force ranging from 3.5 to 5.3 kN. This engine is a single spool, having a
length of 851 mm (33.5 in), diameter of 348 mm (13.7 in), and dry weight of 61.2 kg
(135 lb). March 20, 1983, represents the ﬁrst-ever ﬂight of a micro-turbojet-
powered model aircraft, which had a three-minute ﬂight. This engine measured
4¾00 in diameter and 13½00 long and weighed 3¾ pounds. At 85,000 rpm it produced
over 9 lb of thrust and had a top speed of 97,000 rpm. Twenty years later,
commercial engines of roughly similar dimensions and weight are in the 30-lb
thrust class when running at 120,000 rpm. The airframe, with its twin-boom high-
tail conﬁguration, is remarkably, perhaps inevitably, similar to many of today’s
trainer aircraft.
The ﬁrst commercial micro-turbines were made available by JPX in the early
1990s [6]. Shortly after, Germany and the Netherlands sought out to develop a
powerful, lightweight, liquid-fueled micro-turbine. AMT and Schreckling Designs
were the ﬁrst two companies to accomplish these goals. Figure 6.9 shows a cross
section of micro-turbojet engine (SR-30). Table 6.1 shows some data for micro-
turbojet engines.
Figure 6.10 illustrates Harpoon missile which is an air-, surface-, or submarine-
launched anti-surface (antiship) missile. It is powered by Teledyne CAE J402 small
turbojet engine (together with a solid-propellant booster). Teledyne CAE J402
turbojet engine is thoroughly discussed in Example (6.8).
Example 6.8 Harpoon Block II (Fig. 6.10) is the world’s premier antiship missile.
It uses solid-propellant booster for launch and Teledyne CAE J402 turbojet for
cruise. General characteristics of Teledyne turbojet engine:
Inlet diameter: 14.35 cm
Compressor type: single-stage axial compressor and single-stage centrifugal com
pressor, having overall pressure ratio: 5.6:1

Turbofan
6.3.1
Introduction
Turbofan engines are the dominant air-breathing engines in the last 4 decades. They
are the most reliable engines ever developed. Turbofans were ﬁrst termed by Rolls-
Royce as bypass turbojet. Boeing Company sometimes identiﬁes them as fanjets
[7]. In turbofan or “bypass” engine, the partly compressed airﬂow is divided, some
into a central part, the gas generator or core, and some into a surrounding casing, the
bypass or fan duct. The gas generator acts like a turbojet, while the bypass air is
accelerated relatively slowly down the duct to provide “cold stream” thrust. The
cold and hot streams mix inside or outside the engine to give better propulsive
efﬁciency, lower noise levels, and improved fuel consumption.
Gas generator in both of turbofan and turbojet engines has three modules,
namely, compressor, combustion chamber, and turbine. In turbofan engines, the
fan pressurizes air and feeds it aft. Most goes around the engine core through a
nozzle-shaped chamber. The rest goes through the engine core where it mixes with
fuel and ignites. The hot gases expand through the turbine section and next the hot
nozzle as it exits the engine.

In the 1950s, Rolls-Royce introduced the ﬁrst turbofan in the world, namely,
RB.80 Conway. Conway design and development started in the 1940s, but it was
used only in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Conway powered versions of the
Handley Page Victor, Vickers VC10, Boeing 707-420, and Douglas DC-8-40. It
had a very low-bypass ratio (BPR designated as β) of 0.25 and maximum thrust of
76.3 kN [8]. In 1964, another RR turbofan engine was produced having also a
low-bypass ratio of 0.64. GE led the way of high-bypass ratio turbofan engines in
1965 with the TF39 (BPR 8) to power the C-5 Galaxy [9]. Rolls-Royce developed
the ﬁrst worldwide three-spool turbofan engines RB211 in 1969 having a high-
bypass ratio ranging from 4.0 to 5.0 depending on its series [10].
GE still leads HBPR turbofan engines with GE90 (BPR of 9) [11]. The maxi-
mum achieved BPR is 12.0:1 which is a record number scored by Pratt and Whitney
in 2013 in its PW1500 series, which powered Bombardier CSeries CS100 and
CS300 (second half of 2015), and PW 1100G series, which powered Airbus
A319neo, A320neo, and A321neo in October 2015 [12]. The PW1400 series will
power the Russian Federation airplane Irkut MC-21 in 2017, whereas the PW1700
series will power Embraer E-Jets E2 in 2018.
There are several advantages to turbofan engines over both of turboprop and the
turbojet engines. The fan is not as large as the propeller, so the increase of speeds
along the blade is less. Thus, turbofan engines power now all civil transports ﬂying
at transonic speeds up to Mach 0.9. Also, by enclosing the fan inside a duct or
cowling, the aerodynamics is better controlled. There is less ﬂow separation at the
higher speeds and less trouble with shock developing. The turbofan may suck in
more airﬂow than a turbojet, thus generating more thrust. Like the turboprop
engine, the turbofan has low fuel consumption compared with the turbojet. The
turbofan engine is the best choice for high-speed, subsonic commercial airplanes.

Milestones
Appendix C presents detailed list of milestones of turbofan engines.
6.3.3
Classiﬁcations of Turbofan Engines
As described in Chap. 1, numerous types of turbofan exist. Figure 6.11 illustrates a
very detailed classiﬁcation of turbofan engines.
Turbofan engines may be classiﬁed based on fan location as either forward or aft
fan. Based on a number of spools, it may be classiﬁed as single, double, and three
(triple) spools. Based on a bypass ratio, it may be categorized as either low- or high-
bypass ratio. The fan may be geared or ungeared to its driving low-pressure turbine.
Moreover, mixed types (low-bypass types) may be ﬁtted with afterburner or not.
Cross matching between different categories is identiﬁed in Fig. 6.11.

Turbine-Based Engines: Turbojet, Turbofan, and Turboramjet Engines

High-bypass ratio turbofan (β ¼ 7  8) achieves around 75 % of its thrust from
the bypass air and is ideal for subsonic transport aircraft. Examples in commercial
usage are Rolls-Royce Trent series (500/700/800/900/1000 powering in the Airbus
A330, A340, A350, and A380), Pratt & Whitney PW1000 G (geared) powering
Airbus A320neo, Bombardier CSeries, Embraer E2, Mitsubishi Regional Jet
MC-21, and General Electric GE90 series (76B/77B/85B/90B/92B/94B/110B1/
115B) powering Boeing 777-300ER, 747.
A low-bypass ratio turbofan, where the air is divided approximately equally
between the gas generator and the bypass duct, is well suited to high-speed military
usage. Examples in military usage are Rolls-Royce RB199 in the Tornado, Pratt &
Whitney F100-PW-200 in F-16A/B and F-15, as well as EuroJet Turbo GmbH
EJ200 powering the Typhoon.
It is too lengthy to analyze all types of turbofan engines. So, the following cases
will be analyzed:
Double-spool unmixed ﬂow turbofan
Tripe-spool unmixed turbofan
Double-spool mixed turbofan with afterburner
Aft fan engine
First of all, let us deﬁne the bypass ratio as:

Thus, if the air mass through the core (compressor) is ( _ma), then the bypass air (fan
duct) mass ﬂow rate is (β _ma).Typical component efﬁciencies and speciﬁc heat ratios
for a supersonic turbofan engine having a bypass ratio, β ¼ 2.7, are given in
Table 6.2.

Forward Fan Unmixed Double-Spool Conﬁguration
The main components here are the intake, fan, fan nozzle, low-pressure compressor
(booster), high-pressure compressor, combustion chamber, high-pressure turbine,
low-pressure turbine, and turbine nozzle. Two cases are seen for the low-pressure
spool, namely:
Fan and low-pressure compressor (LPC) on one shaft and driven by
low-pressure turbine
Fan driven by the LPT and the compressor driven by the HPT
Typical examples for the ﬁrst type are the General Electric CF6 engine series
and Pratt & Whitney PW4000 series. Typical example for the second type is GE
Rolls-Royce F136 engine.
A schematic diagram for the ﬁrst type as well as its T-s diagram is shown in
Figs. 6.12 and 6.13.
Low-pressure spool is rotating with N1 speed, while the high-pressure spool is
rotating with N2 speed.
Here below is an analysis for the different modules of the engine:
1. Intake
The inlet module is analyzed quite similar to turbojet engine using Eqs. (6.1),
(6.2), and (6.3).
2. Fan
A similar analysis to the compressor section is followed. The appropriate

The ﬂow in the jet pipe is frequently associated with a pressure drop mainly due to
skin friction.
Thus, the pressure upstream of the turbine nozzle is slightly less than the outlet
pressure from the turbine. The temperature, however, is the same. Thus:

Forward Fan Mixed-Flow Engine
Mixed turbofan engines are always found in either single- or two-spool engines. It
was used in the past for military applications only. Nowadays it is used in many
civil aircrafts but nearly all military aircrafts. An example for a two-spool engine in
civil aircrafts is the CFM56 series. The cold compressed air leaving the fan will not
be directly exhausted as previously described, but it ﬂows in a long duct surround-
ing the engine core and then mixes with the hot gases leaving the low-pressure
turbine. Thus, the cold air is heated while the hot gases are cooled. Only one mixed
exhaust is found.
6.3.5.1
Mixed-Flow Two-Spool Engine
Most of the mixed turbofan engines now are two-spool ones. If mixed turbofan
engines are analyzed versus unmixed turbofan engines, reasonable improvements
[14] in the following points are noticed; thrust generated, noise reduction and
reverse thrust increase.
Hereafter, a detailed analysis of this category will be given. Figures 6.15 and
6.16 present the engine layout and its temperature–entropy diagram.
The requirements for the mixing process are equal static pressures and also equal
velocities. Thus, from the layout designation, these two conditions are speciﬁed as
P
0
3 ¼ P7 and V
0
3 ¼ V7 which means that if no pressure losses in the bypass duct
connecting the cold and hot streams and no pressure loss in the mixing process,
then:
P010 ¼ P
0
03 ¼ P07 ¼ P08
ð6:58Þ
If losses exist in the fan bypass duct, then:
P
0
03 ¼ P010  ΔPfan duct
and
P07 ¼ P08 ¼ P
0
03
In the above equation, no pressure drop is considered during the mixing process.

In some engines like the CFM56 series, the mixing process takes place in a mixer
preceding the nozzle. It results in a quieter engine than if the mixer was not present.

3. Mixing process
The hot gases leaving the low-pressure turbine and the cold air leaving the fan
bypass duct are mixed, giving new properties at state (8). Thus, such a process is
governed by the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics as follows:

Now for a better evaluation of the gas properties after mixing, we can use mass-
weighted average properties of the gases at state (8) as follows:

Consider the real case of mixing where normally losses are encountered and a
pressure drop is associated with the mixing process. Such pressure losses are either
given as the value ΔPmixing or as a ratio rm in the mixing process:
P08 ¼ P07  ΔPmixing

Mixed Turbofan with Afterburner
Since more than three decades, most military aircrafts are powered by a low-bypass
ratio turbofan ﬁtted with an afterburner [15]. One of the earliest afterburning
turbofan engines is the Pratt & Whitney TF30 that powered the F-111 and the
F-14A Tomcat. First ﬂight of the TF30 was in 1964 and production continued until
1986. Afterburning gives a signiﬁcant thrust boost for takeoff particularly from
short runways like air carriers, transonic acceleration, and combat maneuvers, but is
very fuel intensive. This engine is a mixed low-bypass ratio forward fan one. The
mixed ﬂow still has a sufﬁcient quantity of oxygen for another combustion process.
Thus, an afterburner is installed downstream of the low-pressure turbine and
upstream of the nozzle. Tremendous amounts of fuel are burnt in the afterburner
when it is lit. This rises the temperature of exhaust gases by a signiﬁcant amount
which results in a higher exhaust velocity/engine speciﬁc thrust. For a turbofan
engine, afterburning (or reheat) offers greater gains because of the relatively low
temperature, after mixing of the hot and cold streams and the large quantity of the
excess air available for combustion. Exhaust nozzle is normally of the variable area
type to furnish a suitable media for different operating conditions. Unlike the main
combustor, an afterburner can operate at the ideal maximum (stoichiometric)
temperature (i.e., about 2100 K). Now, at a ﬁxed total applied fuel-to-air ratio,
the total fuel ﬂow for a given fan airﬂow will be the same, regardless of the dry
speciﬁc thrust of the engine. However, a high speciﬁc thrust turbofan will, by
deﬁnition, have a higher nozzle pressure ratio, resulting in a higher afterburning
net thrust and, therefore, lower afterburning speciﬁc fuel consumption.
Though afterburning turbofan engines are mostly two-spool engine, some few
single-spool ones are found. An example for single-spool afterburning is the
SNECMA M53 developed for the Dassault Mirage 2000 ﬁghter. The engine is in
service with different air forces, including the latest Mirage 2000–5 and 2000–9
multirole ﬁghters. It had two variants, M 53–5 and M63-P2, which develop dry
thrust, 54.0–64.7 kN, and wet (afterburning thrust) of 86.3–95.1 kN. Overall
464

Turbine-Based Engines: Turbojet, Turbofan, and Turboramjet Engines

pressure ratio is 9.8:1, bypass ratio is 0.36:1, speciﬁc fuel consumption is 0.90
(kg/daN.h), and thrust-to-weight ratio is 6.5.
Examples for other two-spool afterburning turbofans are:
The Pratt & Whitney series F100-220 (thrust: 40 K), F100-229 (48 K), F100-232
(28 K), F119 (65 K)
Eurojet EJ200
General Electric F110
Rolls-Royce Adour Mk.104
Russian engine RD-133
It is interesting to add here that military engines are now so powerful that the
latest ﬁghters can supercruise; (ﬂying at sustained supersonic speed without the use
of the afterburner). Examples are the Lockheed Martin: F-22 Raptor and
Euroﬁghter: Euroﬁghter Typhoon can accelerate to supersonic speed (without
using augmentation) and then sustain such a speed indeﬁnitely in dry thrust. F-22
can supercruise at Mach 1.82, while Euroﬁghter Typhoon can supercruise at Mach
1.1–1.5.
A. Forward fan mixed afterburning low-bypass turbofan (LBPT) engine
The ﬂow mixing will be the only difference in the cycle from that of afterburning
turbojet engine. Figure 6.17 shows the conﬁguration of a single-spool afterburning
turbofan engine, while Fig. 6.18 shows its T-s diagram, and Fig. 6.19 shows its
block diagram together with its input and output data.
A typical layout of a two-spool afterburning turbofan engine is displayed in
Fig. 6.20, while its T-s diagram for an ideal cycle is shown in Fig. 6.21.

The same conditions necessary for mixing described above still hold. Thus, the
following relation stands for ideal conditions (no pressure losses):
P010 ¼ P07 ¼ P08 ¼ P011
Normally mixing process is associated with pressure losses, which may be
governed by either one of the following equations for losses:
P08 ¼ P07  ΔPmixing

Here P011 is the total pressure at the outlet of the afterburner, when it is operative.
Moreover, the outlet temperature of the afterburner is T011 which is known in
advance. It is limited by the maximum temperature that the material of afterburner
can withstand. However, it could be much higher than the total turbine inlet
temperature (TIT) due to the absence of mechanical stresses arising from centrif-
ugal forces created by the rotation of the turbine blades.

Now the mass balance in the afterburner gives the following afterburner fuel-to-

Geared Turbofan (GTF)
Geared turbofans are of the two-spool unmixed forward fan category (Figs. 6.22
and 6.23). Since the fan is normally part of the low spool, both fan and LPT are
turning at the same speed (N1). This speed, however, often is a compromise. The fan
really operates more efﬁciently at low rotational speeds (rpm), while the rest of the
low spool is more efﬁcient at higher speeds. Putting a reduction gear in between
these components makes it possible for the fan and the low spool to run at their
468

Turbine-Based Engines: Turbojet, Turbofan, and Turboramjet Engines

optimum speed, namely, N1 for fan and N3 for LPT. This in turn will minimize the
possibility of formation of shock waves in the fan leading to a higher efﬁciency.
The other advantages are more fuel efﬁciency, reduced noise levels, reduced
emission (CO2 and NOx), fewer engine parts (fewer compressors and turbine
stages), as well as reduction in overall operating costs. Gearbox used here is of
the planetary type as shown in Fig. 6.22. Planetary gearbox is recommended as its
length is short to match with minimum size requirements of turbofan engines.
Examples of geared turbofan engines
Low-pressure spool may be either composed of a fan driven by low-pressure
turbine or a fan and low-pressure compressor representing the compression section
driven by a low-pressure turbine. In either cases, a reduction gearbox is located
directly downstream the fan.

An example for geared turbofan is the Honeywell LF 507 produced by
Lycoming, AlliedSignal, and then Honeywell Aerospace. The earlier ALF 502
was certiﬁed in 1980 [16]. The improved, higher-thrust LF 507 was used on the
Avro RJ update of the British Aerospace BAe 146. Lycoming ALF502R shown in
Fig. 6.23.
A second example is Pratt &Whitney PurePower PW1000G series (PW1100/
1200/1400/1500/1700 G/1900) engine which represents the future geared turbofan
scheduled for 2015–2018 [17]. It will power A320neo, MRJ, MS-21, and CSeries.
The PurePower PW1000G engine family has a maximum thrust in the range
62–100 kN.
It also has the following advantages;
It improves fuel burnup to 16 % versus today’s best engines. That alone could save
airlines nearly $1,400,000 per aircraft per year
It cuts carbon emissions by more than 3500 t per aircraft per year. That’s equal to
the effect of planting more than 900,000 trees.
It will be ready to power aircraft well with biofuels since it has successfully been
tested with alternative fuel.

Its TALON™X combustor slashes polluting emissions. Thus, it will surpass the
most stringent standards (CAEP/6) by 50 % for nitrous oxide (NOx).
It slashes aircraft noise footprints by up to 75 %—a big relief to communities. At up
to 20 dB below today’s most stringent standard, it is the quietest engine in its
class, meaning lower noise fees, shorter ﬂight tracks, extended curfew operation,
and quieter cabins.
Now, concerning thermodynamic analysis of geared turbofan, if the mechanical
efﬁciency of gearbox is ηgb, then two cases are examined. Firstly, the low-pressure
spool is composed of fan and a low-pressure turbine. The fan states are 2 and 3 and
the LPT states are 6 and 7. Then energy balance is expressed by the relation:

ð
Þ ¼ ηgbλ1ηm1 _ma 1 þ f  b

Þ Cph T06  T07
ð
Þ
ð6:66Þ
where b ¼ _mb
_ma is the air bleed ratio deﬁning the ratio between the air bled and the
HPC to the core airﬂow rate.
In the second case, the low-pressure turbine (states 6 and 7) drives both fan
(states 2 and 10) and low-pressure compressor (states 10 and 3). Then the energy
balance equation will be expressed as:
1 þ β

Next, if air is bled from at a station within the high-pressure compressor (HPC),
identiﬁed by the pressure P03b, then the energy balance of the high-pressure spool is
given by:

Forward Fan Unmixed Three-Spool Engine
The three-spool engine is composed of a low-pressure, intermediate-pressure, and
high-pressure spools running at different speeds (N1, N2, and N3). The fan and the
low-pressure turbine (LPT) compose the low-pressure spool. The intermediate
spool
is
composed
of
an
intermediate-pressure

(IPC)
and
intermediate-pressure turbine (IPT). The high-pressure spool is also composed of
a high-pressure compressor (HPC) and high-pressure turbine (HPT). Rolls-Royce

was the ﬁrst aero engine manufacturer to design, develop, and produce the three-
spool turbofan engine. The Rolls-Royce RB211 was the ﬁrst three-spool engine to
enter service (1972). Later on several manufacturers developed and manufactured
this type of engines.
The main advantages of three-spool arrangement:
1. Shorter modules and shafts which result in a shorted engine
(a)
Single-stage fan with no booster stages
(b)
Fewer overall compressor stages and fewer variable stages
(c)
Shorter high-pressure compressor
2. Higher efﬁciencies as each spool is running at its “optimum speed”
3. Greater engine rigidity
4. Lighter weight
The main drawbacks of this three-spool category are that they are more complex
to build and maintain [18].
Examples for three-spool engines
1. Rolls-Royce RB211
The ﬁrst of the whole series was RB211-22 series [18] which ﬁrst saw service in
1972.Its thrust rating is 169 kN. Several subsequent series were developed with
thrust rating of 222–270 kN, featured FADEC (full authority digital engine—or
electronics—control), and wide-chord fan (which increases efﬁciency, reduces
noise, and gives added protection against foreign object damage).
2. Rolls-Royce Trent
It is a family of high-bypass developed from RB211 with thrust ratings of
236–423 kN. Its layout provides lighter weight and better performance. It features
the wide-chord fan and single crystal high-pressure turbine blades with improved
performance and durability. The core turbomachinery is brand new, giving better
performance, noise, and pollution levels.
The layout of this engine and the T-s diagram is shown in Figs. 6.24 and 6.25.
Air bleed is also extracted from the high-pressure compressor at station (4b), not
shown.

The same procedure discussed earlier in evaluating the fuel-to-air ratio, jet veloc-
ities of the cold air, and hot gases from the fan and turbine nozzles may be followed
here. The propulsive, thermal, and overall efﬁciencies are obtained following the
appropriate equations from Chap. 2.

HP and IP turbines as shown in Fig. 6.27. Engine has the following data in Table 6.4

Introduction
Long distance airliner ﬂights are troublesome to passengers particularly if it last for
more than 6 h. This motivated aerospace industry for working hard in designing and
manufacturing airplanes and space planes that will satisfy the greatest human
demands for faster and comfortable Earth and space ﬂights. This can be achieved
by designing engines that power airplanes/space planes which ﬂy at high speeds
(Mach 3.0+) and high altitudes (20,000+ m). Such propulsion system has to facil-
itate low subsonic conditions for takeoff/climb ﬂight segments and hypersonic
speeds for cruise operation. Such tough requirements can be achieved only through
combined-cycle engines (CCE) or sometimes identiﬁed as hybrid engines. These
engines will combine a turbine-based cycle (TBC) (turbojet or turbofan) for low-to-
moderate ﬂight speed operation and a ram-based cycle (RBC) (ramjet, scramjet, or
dual combustion scram) for high-speed conditions. These are also frequently
identiﬁed as turbine-based combine cycle (TBCC) engines.
Moreover, such hybrid engines can also be employed in the long-range tactical
missiles as well as high-performance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or
unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) [39].
Figure 6.28 illustrates such a hybrid engine powering a future super-/hypersonic
speed transport.
Figure 6.29a illustrates hybrid engine layout for low-/moderate-speed operation,
where turbojet (or turbofan) engine is active, while ramjet/scramjet engine is
inoperative. Figure 6.29b illustrates operative ramjet/scramjet engine and inopera-
tive turbojet/turbofan engine during high-speed operation.
Concerning turbine-based cycle, only afterburning category of turbojet or tur-
bofan engines is employed. However, all types of ram, scram, or dual combustion
scram are employed as ram-based cycles. These two groups will generate the
following six different combinations for the TBCC:
Turbojet and ramjet (TJRJ)
Turbojet and scramjet (TJSJ)
Turbojet and dual combustion scramjet (TJDJ)
Turbofan and ramjet (TFRJ)
Turbofan and scramjet (TFSJ)
Turbofan and dual combustion scramjet (TFDJ)

Figure 6.30 shows block diagram of these different combinations of the turbine-
based combined cycle [19].
It is worth mentioning here that for an aircraft cruising at Mach 6, a multistage
vehicle is an alternative for TBCC (or hybrid) engine. A multistage vehicle is
composed of two vehicles (or stages), one having turbine engines to enhance
takeoff and acceleration to supersonic speeds where the second vehicle (stage) is
driven by ramjet or scramjet engines for supersonic/hypersonic ﬂight speeds
(Fig. 6.31).
In the following sections, a brief historical review of super-/hypersonic aircrafts
followed by mathematical modeling of such complex engine will be given.

Historical Review of Supersonic and Hypersonic
Aircrafts
6.4.2.1
Supersonic Aircrafts and Programs
Supersonic aircrafts have been used almost entirely for research and military
purposes. Only two airliners, Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144, were ever
designed for civil use.
Quick highlights will be described as:
On October 14, 1947, the Bell X-1 rocket plane, launched at an altitude of
approximately 20,000 ft from the Boeing B-29, became the ﬁrst airplane to ﬂy
faster than the speed of sound [20]. The X-1 reached a speed of 1127 km/h (Mach
1.06) at an altitude of 43,000 ft. However, it was powered by a liquid-fueled rocket.
In 1954, the second generation of Bell X-1 reached a Mach number of 2.44 at an
altitude of 90,000 ft.
On December 22, 1964, Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird (Fig. 6.32) entered service.
It is a long-range, strategic reconnaissance aircraft which can ﬂy at Mach number of
(3+), maximum speed (3530+) km/h at 80,000 ft (24,000 m). It is powered by
2 Pratt & Whitney J58-1, turboramjet engines continuous-bleed afterburning tur-
bojet [21]. However, it retired on October 9, 1999.
The Tupolev Tu-144 was the ﬁrst commercial supersonic transport aircraft
(SST), Fig. 6.33. The design, publicly unveiled in January 1962, was constructed
Fig. 6.31 A multistage aircraft concept

in the Soviet Union under the direction of the Tupolev design bureau, headed by
Alexei Tupolev. The prototype ﬁrst ﬂew on December 31, 1968, near Moscow, two
months before the ﬁrst ﬂight of Concorde. The Tu-144 ﬁrst went supersonic on June
5, 1969, and, on May 26, 1970, became the ﬁrst commercial transport to exceed

Mach 2. Tu-144 is powered by 4  Kolesov RD-36-51 turbojet, 200 kN (44,122 lbf)
each. It was withdrawn from service 1985 after only a ten-year line life. However,
in 1994, NASA had some developments for TU-144 that led to the ﬁrst ﬂight of the
ﬂying laboratory plane TU-144LL on November 29, 1996. The last time TU-144
was shown was during MAKS 2013 Eleventh International Aviation and Space
Salon held from August 27 to September 1, 2013, in Zhukovsky, Moscow region.

while on April 9, 1969, “Concorde” British prototype 002 made its ﬁrst ﬂight from
Filton. Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued commercial ﬂights until
November 26, 2003. Concorde powerplant is 4  Rolls-Royce/SNECMA Olympus
593 Mk 610 afterburning turbojets having dry thrust 140 kN each while thrust with
afterburner 169 kN each.
Many projects for SST were cancelled. Examples are:
(British) Bristol Type 223; (French–American) Convair BJ-58-9, Boeing 2707–
100, Lockheed L-2000, Douglas 2229, and Tupolev Tu-244; (Russian–American)
Sukhoi-Gulfstream S-21
Supersonic business jets (SSBJ) are a proposed class of small supersonic aircraft.
None has yet ﬂown. Examples are Aerion SBJ, HyperMach SonicStar, Tupolev
Tu-444, and Gulfstream X-54. All are still under development.
Examples for ﬂying strategic bombers (deﬁned as a heavy bomber that carries a
large bomb load over long distances) are Convair B-58A Hustler (1956), Tupolev

more of turbojet or turbofan engines ﬁtted with afterburners.
6.4.2.2
Hypersonic Vehicles
Aircraft or spacecrafts ﬂying at speeds above Mach 5 are often referred to as
hypersonic aircraft. A very brief review of the work held in the ﬁeld of hypersonic
aviation in different countries is given in [22]. NASA has been working in the
design of a lot of hypersonic commercial aircrafts from the 1970s till now. Perhaps
one of the most well-known activity concepts is the commercial derivative of the
NASP project.
Concerning military applications, trends of the 1950s and 1960s indicated that
military aircraft had to ﬂy faster and higher to survive, so concepts for high-altitude
ﬁghters and bombers cruising at Mach 4 or more were not uncommon. Although the
trend soon ﬁzzled and military planners looked to maneuverability and stealth for
survival, the military has recently shown renewed interest in hypersonic ﬂight. For
example, many have conjectured about the existence of a Mach 5 spy plane, the
Aurora, that may be a scramjet powered (Fig. 6.35).
The only manned aircraft to ﬂy in the low hypersonic regime was the X-15
(Fig. 6.36) and the Space Shuttle during reentry. American Robert White ﬂew the
X-15 rocket-powered research aircraft at Mach 5.3 thereby becoming the ﬁrst pilot
484

Turbine-Based Engines: Turbojet, Turbofan, and Turboramjet Engines

to reach hypersonic velocities and at a record altitude of 314,750 ft on July
17, 1962. White’s mark was later topped by fellow X-15 pilot Pete Knight who
ﬂew the craft to a maximum speed of Mach 6.72 in 1967. The record still stands
today as the highest velocity ever reached by an aircraft. Recently, an unmanned
X-43A used a scramjet, to make two hypersonic ﬂights, one at Mach 7, the other at
Fig. 6.35 Aurora a hypersonic ﬁghter

Mach 10. Because lift and drag depend on the square of the velocity, hypersonic
aircraft do not require a large wing area.
6.4.3
Technology Challenges of the Future Flight
The key technology challenges that are derived from the customer requirements and
vehicle characteristics are related to economics, environment, or certiﬁcation [23]:
Environment
Benign effect on climate and atmospheric ozone
Low landing and takeoff noise
Low sonic boom
Economics range, payload, fuel burn, etc.
Low weight and low empty weight fraction
Improved aerodynamic performance
Highly integrated airframe/propulsion systems
Low thrust speciﬁc fuel consumption (TSFC)
Long life
Certiﬁcation for commercial operations
Acceptable handling and ride qualities
Passenger and crew safety at high altitudes
Reliability of advanced technologies, including synthetic vision
Technical justiﬁcation for revising regulations to allow supersonic operations over
land
6.4.4
Propulsion System Conﬁgurations
6.4.4.1
Introduction
There are two main layouts for the turboramjet (or TBCC) engine, namely:
Wraparound conﬁguration
Over–under conﬁguration
The differences between them are:
The position of the ram with respect to turbojet
The position of the afterburner of the turbojet with respect to the ram
Wraparound turboramjet
The wraparound installation methods are limited for axisymmetric propulsion
systems. In such a conﬁguration, the turbojet is mounted inside a ramjet (Fig. 6.37).

Turbine-Based Engines: Turbojet, Turbofan, and Turboramjet Engines

Usually both engines share the same intake and nozzle, while the combustion
chamber of the ramjet engine may be located in the afterburner of the turbojet
engine or separated from it. The ﬂow is divided between the two engines by mean of
a number of bypass ﬂaps or movable inlet guide vanes—located just downstream of
the diffuser—that control the air mass fraction passing through each engine. The
wraparound conﬁguration with ram burner in the afterburner of turbojet was used in
the Pratt & Whitney J58 engine that powered the Blackbird SR-71 that ﬂows with
speed of Mach 3+ (Fig. 6.32). Figure 6.37 shows wraparound TBCC installed on
SR-71 in its two conﬁgurations for low and high Mach number operation [26]. Dur-
ing low-speed ﬂight, these controllable ﬂaps close the bypass duct and force air
directly into the compressor section of the turbojet. During high-speed ﬂight, the
ﬂaps block the ﬂow into the turbojet, and the engine operates like a ramjet using the
aft combustion chamber to produce thrust.
The Nord 1500 Griffon II, a French aircraft powered by a SNECMA ATAR
101 E-3 dry turbojet and a wraparound ramjet having a separate combustion
chamber, was the ﬁrst aircraft powered by combined-cycle engine in the 1950s
(Fig. 6.38).
Two installation conﬁgurations are seen for the wraparound turbo ramjet
engines, namely:
Wing like SR-71 [25–27] (Fig. 6.37)
Fuselage like Griffon II (Fig. 6.38)
Fig. 6.37 Wraparound turboramjet [26]

6.4.4.2
Over–Under Turboramjet
In over–under conﬁguration, the engines are installed one over the other, while the
vehicle body serves as part of the intake and the nozzle. In this conﬁguration, the
combustion chambers are totally separated. However, two cases are encountered for
intakes and nozzles, namely:
(A) Separate intakes and nozzles (Fig. 6.39)
(B) Shared intake and nozzle (Fig. 6.40)
The ram-based cycle has a rectangle cross section. The intake(s) and nozzle
(s) are rectangle, while they may be shared between the engines. In shared intake
and nozzle, the system should contain ﬂaps in the intake to divide the incoming
airﬂow between the two engines and other ﬂaps in nozzle to control the exit area of
each engine.
In the late 1980s, the NASA Lewis Research Center discussed analytically and
experimentally the performance of over–under TBCC conﬁguration with separated
intakes and nozzles and the interaction between the two intakes. Data from this
study was presented in [28].
The NASA Lewis Research Center in the mid-1990s extended its studies for
over–under TBCC conﬁguration with shared intake and nozzle. Non-afterburning
turbojet engines are integrated with a single-throat ramjet. The result is a simple,
lightweight system that is operable from takeoff to Mach number 6. Flow in intake,
spillage drag, system performance, and modes of operation were discussed in a
series of publications ([29] and [30]).
Concerning installation of over–under layouts, the following types are seen:

6.4.5
Performance of TBCC (or Hybrid Engine)
As previously described, TBCC (or CCE) is composed of different engines
performing different cycles, and each has strong and poor operation range [24] as
illustrated in Fig. 6.44. Designer must then speciﬁes which is which to be employed
in each ﬂight range and whether this engine will operate alone or in a combined
mode with another engine.
Turbine-based engine (turbojet or turbofan) is used during takeoff, climb, as well
as low supersonic Mach numbers. However, engine thrust will start to decrease at a
certain Mach number depending on the overall pressure ratio of the engine and the
bypass ratio for turbofans. In the same time ramjet generates thrust up to Mach
numbers of 5–6 but generates zero or small thrust at takeoff or low subsonic speeds.

Turbine-Based Engines: Turbojet, Turbofan, and Turboramjet Engines

As a result, designer set the turbojet/turbofan functioning at takeoff and operating
alone up to say 1.5 Mach number. Next, turbojet (or turbofan) engine operates in
conjunction with ramjet up to say a 3.0 Mach number. Finally, turbojet (or turbofan)
engine is switched off leaving ramjet operating alone up to a Mach number of 6.0.
Figure 6.45 shows cycle variation with Mach number for a Mach 6 civil airplane
design [31].
Moreover, scramjet keeps generating thrust theoretically up to Mach number of
20. Thus, RBC operates in the scramjet mode for a Mach number range of 6.0–15.0.
For space operation, this engine may have a booster rocket to help the engine in the
transition region or drive the vehicle alone if it moves in space (the aerospace
plane).

Cycle Analysis of Turboramjet (or TBCC) Engine
The analysis for both cases of wraparound and over–under turboramjet is given
hereafter.
6.4.6.1
Wraparound Turboramjet
Designation of different states of engine is identiﬁed in Fig. 6.46. During low-speed
ﬂight, controllable ﬂaps close a bypass duct and force air directly into the com-
pressor section of the turbojet. During high-speed ﬂight, the ﬂaps block the ﬂow
into the turbojet, and the engine operates like a ramjet using the aft combustion
chamber to produce thrust. In a combined mode, air may be split between both
engines. Afterburner of turbojet acts as the combustion chamber of ramjet.
The engine cycle has two modes of operation, either working as a simple single-
spool turbojet or as a ramjet. A plot for the cycle on the temperature, entropy plane,
is illustrated in Fig. 6.47.
6.4.6.1.1
Operation as a Turbojet Engine
In the turbojet mode, a chain description of the different processes through the
different modules is described in Table 6.5.
Different processes have been previously described in details. Input data for
turbojet cycle will be: ambient pressure and temperature, ﬂight Mach number,
pressure ratio of compressor, turbine inlet temperature, maximum temperature in
afterburner, type of nozzle, and lowest heating value for fuel used. Moreover,
efﬁciencies of different modules (intake, compressor(s), combustion chamber,

turbine(s), afterburner and nozzle, mechanical efﬁciency) together with pressure
drop in intake, combustion chamber, and afterburner. Calculations for temperature,
pressure for different states, ﬂight and exhaust speeds, as well as fuel burnt in
combustion chamber and afterburner are given by Eqs. (6.1), (6.2), (6.3a), (6.3b),
(6.4), (6.5), (6.6), (6.7a), (6.7b), (6.8), (6.9a), (6.9b), (6.9c), (6.9d), (6.10), (6.11a),

(6.19b), and (6.20).
Single-spool turbojet engine is discussed here. However, the same procedure can
be followed for double-spool turbojet engine.

In the ramjet mode, the ﬂow is passing through the processes and states described in

ramjet cycle will be: ambient pressure and temperature, ﬂight Mach number,

6.4.6.2
Over–Under Turboramjet
For the over–under conﬁguration of turboramjet engine, the engine height is large
compared to the wraparound conﬁguration. The reason is clear as the height in this
case is the sum of the heights of turbojet and ramjet engines. Usually a part of the
engine is to be buried inside the fuselage or inside the wing. Since the engine will
operate at high Mach number, it needs a long intake. In the fuselage installation
method, the vehicle underbody is completely integrated with the propulsion system
as the upstream lower surface serves as an external compression system intake and
the downstream surface as an external expansion nozzle (Fig. 6.50).
Three possible conﬁgurations for intake may be seen for different ﬂight regimes
(Fig. 6.49). In the ﬁrst case at takeoff and low subsonic ﬂight, the turbojet engine
operates alone where a movable inlet ramp is deployed to allow for the maximum
airﬂow rate into its intake and negligible or zero airﬂow rate into the ramjet engine
(Fig. 6.49a). In the second case of higher Mach number, the engine operates at a
dual mode where both turbojet and ramjet engines are operative for few seconds
until Mach number reaches 2.5 or 3.0. In this case, moveable surfaces allow airﬂow
rates into both engines (Fig. 6.49b). Finally, in the third case of hypersonic speed,
the turbojet engine is shut down and only ramjet becomes operative (Fig. 6.49c). An
example for such layout is found in the four over–under air-breathing turboramjet
engines powering the Mach 5 WaveRider [32].
The complexity of both aerodynamic and mechanical design of two variable throat
nozzles and necessary ﬂaps led to another design including only one nozzle [33]. The
suggested nozzle uses a single-expansion ramp nozzle (SERN) instead of a conven-
tional, two-dimensional, convergent–divergent nozzle. Figures 6.50 and 6.51 illustrate
a layout and T-s diagram of the over–under conﬁguration of the turboramjet engine.
An over–under conﬁguration has also three modes of operation, namely, a
turbojet, a ramjet, or a dual mode. Dual mode represents the combined or transition
mode in which both of the turbojet and ramjet are operating simultaneously.
6.4.6.2.1
Turbojet Mode
In this mode the engine is working as a simple turbojet engine and develops all the
thrust needed by the aircraft. The states and governing equations are the same as the
turbojet in the wraparound conﬁguration.
6.4.6.2.2
Dual Mode
Both of the turbojet and ramjet are operating simultaneously. Turbojet starts declin-
ing and its developed thrust will be intentionally decreased by reducing the inlet air
mass ﬂow rate via its variable geometrical inlet. The ramjet starts working by adding
fuel and starting ignition into its combustion chamber. The thrust generated in the
ramjet is increased by increasing also the air mass ﬂow rate through its variable area
inlet. The generated thrust force will be then the sum of both thrusts of turbojet and
ramjet engines. Same equations for wraparound case are to be applied here.
496

Turbine-Based Engines: Turbojet, Turbofan, and Turboramjet Engines

6.4.6.2.3
Ramjet Mode
In this mode, turbojet stops working and its intake is completely closed. All the air
mass ﬂow passes through the ramjet intake. With a Mach number increase, the
forebody acts as a part of the intake with the foremost oblique shock wave located
close to the aircraft nose, as shown in Fig. 6.48. Also same equations for wrap-
around case will be employed here.

and (c) hypersonic speeds [32]

6.4.7
General Analysis for a Turboramjet Engine
The turbine engine for a turboramjet may be either a turbojet or a of turbofan
engine. In the entire previous sections, only turbojet engine was discussed. How-
ever, if turbofan engine replaces the turbojet engine, then additional parameters
have to be speciﬁed, namely, fan pressure ratio and its isentropic efﬁciency besides
bypass ratio together with the other parameters listed in Sect. 6.4.6.1.1. Moreover,

Turbine-Based Engines: Turbojet, Turbofan, and Turboramjet Engines

for high supersonic speed, the ram-based engine will be a scramjet rather than a
ramjet engine. Figure 6.52 shows the control volume for the general turbo ramjet
engine. Figure 6.53 shows a block digram of the complete system.
The air mass ﬂow through the turbine-based cycle is _maTJ, while the air mass
ﬂow through the ram-based cycle is _maRJ. From cycle analysis the fuel mass
ﬂow rates will be calculated. Apply the mass conservation law (continuity
equations for both cycle to reach Eqs. (6.87) and (6.88). Momentum equation
deﬁnes the thrust force for a full expansion of gases in nozzle(s), Eq. (6.89).
The speciﬁc thrust and TSFC can be obtained through Eqs. (6.90) and (6.91):

Example 6.13 The turboramjet engine discussed in Example (6.12) will be used in
propelling the same aircraft during its operation from ﬂight Mach numbers of 2–4 at
same 20,000 m altitude. For Mach number 2, only the turbojet engine will be used
while the ramjet is off. At Mach number 4, the ramjet will be only operating while
the turbojet will be off.
The drag coefﬁcient for aircraft at different Mach numbers is given in Table 6.7.
Assuming aircraft is moving at constant speeds where thrust and drag forces are
equal, calculate:

Design Procedure
A simpliﬁed design procedure for a turboramjet engine will be given here [35–
37]. The following steps summarize the procedure for high supersonic/hypersonic
cruise aircraft propulsion integration:
1. Mission or ﬂight envelope has to be selected. The cruise altitude is important
from fuel economy point of view, while takeoff, climb, and acceleration are
critical from the surplus thrust that must be available over the aircraft drag force.
2. Calculate the drag force based on drag coefﬁcient variations with Mach number.
3. The needed thrust force must be greater than the drag value all over its Mach
number operation. A margin of 10 % is selected here.
4. Determination of the number of engines based on the maximum thrust suggested
for the hybrid engine at its different modes.
5. The performance of each constituents of the hybrid engine is separately deter-
mined. For example, if the hybrid engine includes a ramjet, turbojet, and
scramjet, each module is examined separately. Thus, the performance of turbojet
engine running alone is considered ﬁrst. The speciﬁc thrust and thrust speciﬁc
fuel consumption are determined for the cases of operative and inoperative
afterburner. Next, the performance of the ramjet operating alone also is consid-
ered. Since the ramjet operates up to Mach number of 6, liquid hydrogen is
considered as its fuel. If a scramjet is available, then its performance is deter-
mined separately also.
6. Optimization of the hybrid engine represents the next difﬁcult step. From the
speciﬁc thrust and thrust speciﬁc fuel consumption, the switching points are
deﬁned. Thus, in this step, the designer selects at which Mach number the
turbojet operates or stops the afterburner and, moreover, at which Mach number
508
6
Turbine-Based Engines: Turbojet, Turbofan, and Turboramjet Engines

the turbojet must be completely stopped and replaced by the ramjet. If a scramjet
is also available, another decision has to be made concerning the switching Mach
number from ramjet to scramjet. The switching process duration and the accom-
panying procedures regarding the air and fuel ﬂow rates and inlet doors actuation
are to be carefully deﬁned.
6.4.9
Future TBCC Engine
The Lockheed Martin SR-72 (Fig. 6.58) is a conceptualized unmanned, hypersonic
aircraft intended for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance proposed by
Lockheed Martin to succeed the retired Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. The SR-72
was dubbed by Aviation Week as “son of Blackbird [38]”. It could be operational by
2030. Moreover, it would ﬂy at speeds up to Mach 6.
The SR-72 will use a turbine-based combined-cycle (TBCC) system. Thus, a
turbine engine will be used from takeoff up to Mach 3, while a dual-mode ramjet
engine will accelerate the vehicle to hypersonic speeds. The turbine and ramjet
engines share common inlet that provides air to both turbine and ramjet and a
common nozzle to discharge exhaust from both engines. Variable inlet and nozzle
ramps open and close to match the cycle requirements.

Conclusion
This chapter is devoted to turbine-based cycle (TBC). Three major types of engines
are analyzed, namely, turbojet, turbofan, and turboramjet engines. Application to
both airliners and missiles is discussed. Detailed classiﬁcations and thermodynamic

Chapter 7
Shaft Engines Turboprop, Turboshaft,
and Propfan
7.1
Introduction
This chapter introduces three types of shaft aero engines, namely, turboprop,
turboshaft, and propfan engines. Piston engines together with these three engine
types complete the group of shaft engines. Turboprop engines have their exhaust
gases leaving the engine at very low speeds, while the exhaust leaves turboshaft
engines at nearly zero speeds. Power rather thrust is the key factor in both.
Turboprop engines power many commuter and heavy transport aircrafts ﬂying at
moderate subsonic speeds. Turboprop engine is composed of two main parts,
namely, gas turbine and propeller. Gearbox couples the propeller to the driving
turbine.
Turboshaft engines are employed in most helicopters, some tanks, and boats as
well as some race cars. In a turboshaft engine, the gearbox is not connected to a
propeller but to some other drive devices, namely, rotor(s) in helicopters and marine
screws in boats, etc. Turboshaft engines employed in other applications are iden-
tiﬁed as industrial gas turbines which are extensively employed in petroleum
industry and electrical power station.
Propfan engines combine many features of both turbofan and turboprop engines.
However, it is distinct from both. The engine uses a gas turbine to drive an
unshielded propeller like a turboprop, but the propeller itself is designed with a
large number of short, highly twisted blades, similar to the fan of a turbofan engine.
Propfan engines have the highest propulsive efﬁciency among all air-breathing
engines including shaft-based, ram-based, and turbine-based engines.

Turboprop Engines
7.2.1
Introduction
Many bush airplanes (like Cessna Caravan and Quest Kodiak) (Fig. 7.1) which are
low-speed transport/cargo aircraft and small commuter aircraft use turboprop
propulsion. However, some large military and civil aircrafts, such as the Lockheed
L-188 Electra (Fig. 7.2) and the Tupolev Tu-95, use turboprop engines also. A
distinguished application for turboprop engines is the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey;
Fig. (7.3), multi-mission, a tilt-rotor military aircraft that has both a vertical takeoff
and landing (VTOL) and short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities. It is
powered by Rolls Royce Allison T406 turboshafts.
The turboprop uses a gas turbine core to turn a propeller. As mentioned in
Chap. 4, propeller engines develop thrust by moving a large mass of air through a
small change in velocity. Propellers are very efﬁcient and can use nearly any kind of
engine to turn the prop. The propeller is driven through a reduction gear by either
the compressor–turbine shaft or a power (or free power) turbine shaft. The reduc
tion gearbox converts the high RPM/low torque output to a low RPM/high torque.
Turboprop power is measured in total equivalent power (either measured in horse-
power or kilowatts). The major part of this total equivalent power is generated by
the propeller, while its minor part is developed from the exhaust gases.
Turboprops have higher propulsive efﬁciency than turbojet and turbofan engines
when they ﬂy under 30,000 ft and speeds below 400–450 mph. This is due to the
low jet velocities of both the propeller and exhaust. Propellers become less efﬁcient
as the speed of the aircraft increases. In this case, the ﬂow may reach or even exceed

sonic speed along the outer portion of its blades giving rise to a substantial increase
in drag coefﬁcient and awful decrease in lift coefﬁcient.
Turboprop engines may be single, double, or triple spools. For a single-spool
engine, the only one turbine drives the only one compressor and propeller (Fig. 7.4).
A two-spool turboprop is composed of one or two compressors and two turbines
(high pressure and low pressure). The low-pressure turbine drives either the single
compressor or the low-pressure compressor (if two compressors are present) and
also drives the propeller (Fig. 7.5). Finally the three-spool engine features three
turbines and two compressors. The propeller is driven by the low-pressure turbine
(Fig. 7.6). The exhaust velocity of a turboprop is low and contributes little thrust
because most of the energy of the core hot gases has gone into turning the drive
shaft.
Moreover, the turboprop engine may be either of the pusher or tractor (puller)
type. Pusher types are installed to either the wing or fuselage. Two possible wing
locations are seen, namely, midwing or wing tip. Concerning fuselage, turboprops
are either installed to the aft pylon or aft end [2].
Tractor types have three possible types of installation, namely, wing, fuselage,
and tail. Turboprops are either installed to the mid or tip of the wing. Concerning
fuselage, two possible locations are seen, namely, forward or aft-fuselage pylon.
Finally tail installation shows three possible positions, namely, low, median, or tip
of the horizontal tail [3].

Milestones
The early name of turboprop engine was “airscrew turbine engine” which was later
given the neater title of turboprop.
Hungarian Gyorgy Jendrassik designed the very ﬁrst working turboprop engine
in 1938, called the “Cs-1.” It was produced and ﬂown in Czechoslovakia
(1939–1942). The engine was ﬁtted to the Varga XG/XH twin-engined reconnais-
sance bomber but proved very unreliable.

A Canadian famous company Pratt & Whitney of Canada (PWC) built a big
family of the popular turboprop/turboshaft engine including PT6, PT6A, PT6B,
PT6C, PT6D, and ST6 as well as PW100 and PW200. The PT6A comes in
65 different versions with engine power ranging from 500 to 2000 shp. Since the
PT6A family entered service in the 1960s, about 40,000 engines have been pro-
duced. To date, the PT6A has accumulated about 300 million ﬂying hours and is
therefore a highly proven and durable engine. It powers numerous aircraft including
Beechcraft 1900, Dornier DO 128-6, Bell412, and Sikorsky S58T.

7.2.3
Thermodynamics Analysis of Turboprop Engines
The different modules of a turboprop engine are the intake or inlet, one or two
compressors, a combustion chamber, and one or more (up to three) turbines and the
exhaust nozzle.
7.2.3.1
Single-Spool Turboprop
A simpliﬁed layout of a single-spool turboprop engine together with its
temperature–entropy (T-s) diagram is shown in Figs. 7.7 and 7.8.
The same procedure followed in Chaps. 5 and 6 will be followed here. The ﬂight
speed is expressed as U ¼ Ma
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

.
The different modules of the engine are treated hereafter.
1. Intake
The intake has an isentropic efﬁciency (ηd), and the ambient temperature and
pressure are (Pa and Ta, respectively), and the ﬂight Mach number is Ma. The
temperature and pressure at the intake outlet are T02 and P02 which may be
calculated using the same governing equations described in Chap. 5.
2. Compressor
For a known compressor pressure ratio (πc) and its isentropic efﬁciency (ηc), the
outlet temperature and pressure are calculated as in Chap. 5. The speciﬁc power of
the compressor is given by the following relation:

3. Combustion chamber
With known combustor efﬁciency of (ηb) and pressure drop in combustor of
(ΔP), then the pressure at the outlet of the combustion chamber and fuel-to-air ratio
are calculated in the same way as in Chap. 5.
4. Turbine
Since the turbine drives the compressor as well as the propeller and the portion
of power transferred to each is not known in advance, then it is not easy here to
determine the outlet pressure and temperature of the turbine. Let us ﬁrst examine
the power transmission from the turbine to the propeller as illustrated in Fig. 7.9.
Only a portion of the turbine power is delivered to the propeller. This propeller
power is dependent on several efﬁciencies, namely, the mechanical efﬁciencies of
turbine, compressor, and propeller, namely, (ηmt, ηmc, ηg) as well as the propeller
efﬁciency (ηpr). Figure 7.9 illustrates the enthalpy–entropy diagram for the expan-
sion processes through both the turbine and the exhaust nozzle. It has been shown
by Lancaster [4] that there is an optimum exhaust velocity that yields the maximum
thrust for a given ﬂight speed, turbine inlet temperature, and given efﬁciencies.
Now deﬁne the following symbols as shown in Fig. 7.9.
Δh ¼ enthalpy drop available in an ideal (isentropic) turbine and exhaust nozzle.
αΔh ¼ Δhts ¼ fraction of Δh that would be available from an isentropic turbine
having the actual pressure ratio.
Δhns ¼ 1  α

ÞΔh ¼ the fraction of Δh that may be available from an isentropic

The procedure to be followed here is to deduce a mathematical expression for the
thrust force generated by the propeller (Tpr) from the power generated by the
propeller. Adding this thrust to the thrust generated by the exhaust gases then the
total thrust is obtained as a function of (α). Differentiate this total thrust with respect
to (α), we can obtain the optimum value of α giving the maximum thrust.
The propeller thrust Tpr is correlated to the propeller power by the relation

A schematic diagram of a two-spool engine having a free power turbine together
with its temperature–entropy diagram is shown in Figs. 7.10 and 7.11. The
low-pressure spool is composed of the propeller and the free power turbine, while
the high-pressure spool is composed of the compressor and the high-pressure or gas
generator turbine.

7.2.4
Equivalent Engine Power
Here two ﬂight phases will be discussed, namely, static run and cruise conditions.
7.2.4.1
Static Condition
During testing (on a test bench) or takeoff conditions, the total equivalent horse-
power is denoted by t.e.h.p. and is equal to the s.h.p. of propeller plus the
s.h.p. equivalent to the net jet thrust. For estimation purposes it is taken that,
under sea-level static conditions, one s.h.p. is equivalent to approximately 2.6 lb
of jet thrust [6]. Thus

Analogy with Turbofan Engines
Turboprop engines are analogous to high-bypass turbofan engines. The propeller
itself is an unducted fan with a bypass ratio equal to or greater than 25. The air ﬂow
through the propeller is slightly accelerated and thus acquires speeds slightly higher
than the aircraft ﬂight speed. The momentum difference between the inlet and outlet
ﬂows through the propeller produces the propeller thrust. Next this accelerated air
passes through the engine core and accelerated to higher speeds. The momentum
difference between the outlet and inlet core ﬂow results in the core thrust. The thrust
force is given by the relation

Turboshaft
7.3.1
Introduction
A turboshaft engine is a form of gas turbine which is optimized to produce shaft
power rather than jet thrust. Generally, a turboshaft engine is made up of two major
parts assemblies: the “gas generator” and the “power section.” The gas generator
consists of one or more compressors, combustion chamber, and one or more
turbines. The power section consists of an additional turbine, a gear reduction
system, and the shaft output. The gas generator creates the hot expanding gases to
drive the power section. Depending on the design, the engine accessories may be
driven either by the gas generator or by the power section. In most designs, the gas
generator and power section are mechanically separate so they can each rotate at
different speeds.
Turboshaft engines are similar to turboprops, except that the hot gases are
expanded to a lower pressure in the turbine, thus providing greater shaft power
and little exhaust velocity. They differ primarily in the function of the turbine.
Instead of driving a propeller, the turbine is connected to a transmission system that
drives helicopter rotors. Other turboshaft engines that will be identiﬁed as industrial
gas turbine engines are used for land and sea applications. Examples for land
applications are electrical generators, compressors, pumps, auxiliary power units,
pumping units for natural gas in cross-country pipelines, tanks, and race cars, where
power turbine drives transmission system. Examples for marine applications are
naval vessels, cargo ships, hydrofoils, hovercrafts, and other vessels, where power
turbine drives marine screw. Many aero engine manufacturers produce two versions
from an engine one as a turboprop while the other as a turboshaft engine. Examples
are the PT6B and PW206 produced by Pratt & Whitney of Canada and AlliedSignal
LTS101-600A-3 and Allison 250-C30M.
An unusual example of the turboshaft principle is the Pratt & Whitney F135-
PW-600 engines for the STOVL F-35B. In conventional mode it operates as a
turbofan, but when powering the LiftFan, it switches partially to turboshaft mode to
send power forward through a shaft (like a turboprop) and partially to turbojet mode
to continue to send thrust to the rear nozzle.
Turboshaft power is measured in shaft horse power (shp), or kilowatts (KW).
7.3.2
Examples for Turboshaft Manufacturers and Engines
Pratt & Whitney of Canada (PWC) built a great family of its popular turboshaft
engine PT6 and PT6A. It powers numerous helicopters including Sikorsky S58T.
General Electric built several turboshaft engines, including CT58 powering
Sikorsky S-61, S-62, and Boeing Vertol CH-47 helicopters and the famous T700/
CT7 turboshaft engines, which powers Bell AH-1 W Super Cobra.

Allison Engine Company in the early 1960s built Allison Model 250, and since
Rolls-Royce acquired Allison in 1995 became the Rolls-Royce M250, (US military
designations T63 and T703). It powered many helicopters including: Agusta
A109A, Bell 206B/L/LT, Bell 407, 230, and 430, and Boeing AH-6.
The Lycoming company built Lycoming T-55-L-7C powering the Boeing Vertol
Chinook CH-47 helicopter, Bell 309, and Piper PA-48 Enforcer [9].
Turbomeca built Arrius 2K1 which powers the Eurocopter EC120 Colibri used
in tourism over New York City [10].
Rolls-Royce built numerous turboshaft engines such as Gem powering August-
aWestland Lynx helicopter and AE1107C-Liberty turboshaft that powers Bell
Boeing V-22 Osprey.

Soloviev Design Bureau built one of the earliest Russian turboshaft engines,
namely, D-25 V in 1957 having 4780 kW (5500 hp) that powered the Mi-6, Mi-10,
and Mi-12 helicopters.
The Ukrainian three-spool turboshaft engine D-136 Series 1 powers the MI-26
transport helicopters that are the largest in the world. Other famous Ukrainian
turboshaft engines are the TB3-117 BMA used to power the KA helicopters and
the TB3-117 BM powering the MI-17 and MI-8 AMT helicopters.
Example 7.4 Figure 7.15 illustrates a helicopter during hovering close to the
ground. A control volume with inlet and outlet dimensions is also shown in ﬁgure.
The total mass of the helicopter is 2000 kg. The exit static pressure is atmospheric.
Assuming the ﬂow is a one-dimensional, steady, and incompressible, calculate:
1. The exit velocity of air V2
2. The power of the turboshaft engine
Solution
A control volume enclosing the helicopter with states (1) and (2) identifying
upstream and downstream of the rotor is shown in Fig. 7.15. Both ends have a
diameter of 3.3 m, while the helicopter body at outlet of control volume, state (2), is
circular having a diameter of 3.0 m.

Thermodynamic Analysis of Turboshaft Engines
A turboshaft engine also has two conﬁgurations: either the load is driven by the same
gas generator shaft (Fig. 7.16) or driven by the free power turbine (Fig. 7.17). The ﬁrst
conﬁguration resembles a single-spool engine while the second is a two-spool one.
The load may be also installed either toward the cold or hot sections. Thermo-
dynamic cycles are plotted on the temperature–entropy (T-s) diagram for single and
556

Shaft Engines Turboprop, Turboshaft, and Propfan

double spools are shown in Figs. 7.17 and 7.19. It is noted that the hot gases expand
in the gas turbine (single spool) or free turbine (double spool) to nearly the ambient
pressure. This provides a greater shaft power and little exhaust velocity.

Power Generated by Turboshaft Engines
7.3.4.1
Single-Spool Turboshaft
From Fig. 7.18, the analysis of diffuser, compressor, and combustion chamber is
typical to that in turboprop engine.
Turbine
The turbine drives both of the compressor and load. Assuming full expansion in
turbine to the ambient pressure, then the speciﬁc power delivered to the output shaft
(Wshaft) is expressed as
Wshaft ¼ 1 þ f  b
ð
ÞηmtWt  Wc
ηmc
ð7:17Þ
where f, b is the fuel-to-air ratio and bleed ratio. The mechanical efﬁciencies for
turbine and compressor are, respectively,ηmt, ηmc.
This shaft which drives the load (here the rotor of a helicopter) experiences some
mechanical losses due to friction in gearbox and bearings, thus
Wload ¼ ηmWshaft

Propfan
7.4.1
Introduction
A propfan is a modern type of aircraft engine related in concept to both the
turboprop and turbofan, but distinct from both. The engine uses a gas turbine to
drive an unshielded propeller like a turboprop, but the propeller itself is designed
564
7
Shaft Engines Turboprop, Turboshaft, and Propfan

with a large number of short, highly twisted blades, similar to the fan of a turbofan
engine.
For this reason, the propfan has been variously described as an unducted fan
(UDF), open rotors (OR), or ultrahigh-bypass (UHB) turbofan. It is described as “a
small diameter, highly loaded multiple-bladed variable-pitch propulsor having
swept wide-chord blades with thin advanced airfoil sections, integrated with a
contoured nacelle”. Propfan is designed to operate with a turbine engine and
using a single-stage reduction gear that results in high performance. The design is
intended to offer the performance of a turbofan, with the fuel economy of a
turboprop.
The most common arrangement of propfan is a two-spool gas generator and
aft-located gearbox driving a pusher fan. This fan produces the majority of thrust. It
has a number of blades greater than propellers of turboprops and less than those of
fan in turbofans. Similarly its bypass ratio is also in-between of turbofan and
turboprop engines.
7.4.2
Historical Hints
During the 1970s due to the oil crisis in 1973, several projects for developing
propfans or unducted fan (UDF) were introduced. The propfan concept was ﬁrst
revealed by Carl Rohrbach and Bruce Metzger of the Hamilton Standard Division
of United Technologies in 1975 and was patented by Robert Cornell and Carl
Rohrbach of Hamilton Standard in 1979. Later work by General Electric on similar
propulsors was done under the name unducted fan, which was a modiﬁed turbofan
engine, with the fan placed outside the engine nacelle on the same axis as the
compressor blades.
Perhaps one of the most signiﬁcant series of propfan studies was conducted
during the late 1970s and early 1980s. This effort culminated in ﬂight tests of the
McDonnell Douglas MD-UHB demo aircraft based on the MD-81 airframe. The
MD-UHB was used to evaluate advanced, experimental propulsion technologies
designed to offer airlines signiﬁcant improvements in fuel efﬁciency and lower
operational costs.
The propfan concept was intended to deliver 35 % better fuel efﬁciency than
contemporary turbofans. In static and air tests on a modiﬁed DC-9, propfans
reached a 30 % improvement. This efﬁciency comes at a price, as one of the
major problems with the propfan is noise, particularly in an era where aircraft are
required to comply with increasingly strict Stage III and Stage IV noise limitations.
GE introduced its Unducted Fan (UDF) GE36 which featured an aft-mounted
open-rotor fan system with two rows of counter-rotating composite fan blades
during the mid-1980s. It is of the pusher conﬁguration. The core was based on a
GE F404 military turbofan. Exhaust gases were discharged through a seven-stage
low-pressure (LP) turbine; each stator ring was designed to move freely in the
opposite direction to that of the rotors. The turbine rotors drive one propeller, while
7.4
Propfan
565

the other prop is connected to the “unearthed” turbine stators and rotates in the
opposite direction. So, in effect, the power turbine has 14 stages (Fig. 7.22).
The GE36 ﬂew on the Boeing 727 and MD-80 aircraft and enabled speeds of
around Mach 0.75. McDonnell Douglas developed a proof-of-concept aircraft by
modifying their MD-80. They removed the JT8D turbofan engine from the left side
of the fuselage and replaced it with the GE36 (Fig. 7.22). A number of test ﬂights
were conducted which proved the airworthiness, aerodynamic characteristics, and
noise signature of the design. The test and marketing ﬂights of the GE-outﬁtted
“Demo Aircraft” concluded in 1988, demonstrating a 30 % reduction in fuel burn
over turbofan-powered MD-80, full Stage III noise compliance, and low levels of
interior noise/vibration. Due to jet-fuel price drops and shifting marketing priori-
ties, Douglas shelved the program the following year.
In the 1980s, Allison collaborated with Pratt & Whitney on demonstrating the
578-DX propfan, having a reduction gearbox between the LP turbine and the
propfan blades. The 578-DX was successfully ﬂight tested on a McDonnell Douglas
MD-80 (Fig. 7.24).
The Progress D-27 propfan (Fig. 7.25), developed in the USSR, is even more
conventional in layout, with the propfan blades at the front of the engine in a tractor
conﬁguration. It is used for propelling Antonov An-180 and An-70 aircrafts in the
Fig. 7.22 Open rotor with counterrotation achieved via statorless LP turbine

1990s. It is worth mentioning that the only ﬂying aircraft powered by a propfan
engine is AN-70.
Rolls-Royce is testing its contra-rotating propfan RB3011 which is planned to
ﬂy by 2020.
7.4.3
Classiﬁcations of Propfans
There are two main types of propfans:
1. Tractor type
2. Pusher type
Fig. 7.23 Unducted fan installed in MD-80
7.4
Propfan
567

1. Tractor (or puller)-type propfan is similar to forward fan with the fan placed
outside the engine nacelle (Fig. 7.23). Propfans are normally of the wing
installation type. Also such arrangement dictates a high-wing design.
This type is next divided into
(A). Single
(B). Contra-rotating (or counter-rotating)
An example is the contra-rotating propfan installed to the aircraft AN-70
(Fig. 7.26). The forward rotor is 8 bladed, while the rear is six bladed.
2. Pusher-type propfan is similar to the aft fan where the fan is coupled to the
turbine. It is always of the contra-rotating type (Fig. 7.27). The two fan rows are
driven by free power turbine. This type would be more elegant, as the engines
would be placed behind the rear pressure bulkhead in the fuselage, minimizing
noise. It also would allow for an aerodynamically “clean” wing.

7.4.4
Comparisons Between Turboprop, Propfan,
and Turbofan
Propfan engines have the best ever known propulsive efﬁciency. Single-rotation
propfan engines have propulsive efﬁciency around 80 %, while contra-rotating
propfan ones have higher efﬁciency close to 90 %. The main features of the propfan
engines versus both turboprop and turbofan engines are given in the following
Table 7.1.

7.4
Propfan
569

Propfan engines have the highest propulsive efﬁciency, the potential to signif-
icantly reduce fuel consumption and emission relative to state-of-art high-bypass
ratio geared turbofan engines [11] and [12]. Moreover, in terms of beneﬁts to the
aircraft operator and the environmental impact, relative to today’s aircraft, a future
open-rotor-powered aircraft could save approximately $3 million and 10,000 tons
of C02 per year per aircraft. Further consideration needs to be given to the trade-off
between fuel burn (global) and noise (local).

Shaft Engines Turboprop, Turboshaft, and Propfan

However, open rotors present many technological challenges [13] and [14],
including:
•
Noise and vibration (both inside and outside the aircraft cabin)
•
Structural reinforcement of the fuselage and wings
•
Airworthiness considerations (blade-off, etc.)
•
Engine installation and mounting
•
Gearbox cooling and reliability
•
Design of efﬁcient counter-rotating components
•
Competing technologies: The efﬁciency of current technology engines is
improving at an average of 1 % a year—which means traditional turbofan
engines available in 2020 are likely to be at least 11 % more efﬁcient than
2010 production models, without any major technology risk. Meanwhile, the
Fig. 7.27 Typical pusher propfan

571

Pratt & Whitney PW1000G geared turbofan could provide a 22–23 % fuel
efﬁciency gain by 2017, according to the company, while the CFM International
non-open-rotor LEAP-X design could provide 16 % lower fuel consumption
than the CFM56-7 by 2018. Some manufacturers are skeptical about open-rotor
technology.
•
Slower aircraft operating speeds: An open-rotor-powered aircraft is likely to
have a cruising speed 5–10 % slower than a turbofan-powered aircraft.
Example 7.7 A three-spool pusher-type propfan or unducted fan engine (UDF) is
ﬁtted to an aircraft ﬂying at a speed of 220 m/s and altitude of 6 km (Ta ¼ 249.2 K
and Pa ¼ 47.182 kPa) (Fig. 7.28). The engine is composed of three spools:
intermediate-pressure spool composed of an intermediate-pressure compressor
driven by an intermediate-pressure turbine, a high-pressure compressor driven by
a high-pressure turbine, and the unducted fan (resembling a low-pressure compres-
sor) driven by a low-pressure turbine. The maximum temperature is 1400 K and
fuel having a heating value of 40,000 kJ/kg is used. It has the following particulars:

Detailed analyses for three shaft engines, namely, turboprop, turboshaft, and
propfan, are given.
Turboprop engines were invented after turbojet to develop a better propulsive
efﬁciency. It is used in bush, commuter, and some heavy transport aircrafts.
Propeller provides most of the power, while exhaust gases (having very low
speeds) generated about 15 % of total power. Propeller design is the same as
those coupled to piston engines. So the only solved example for the giant 8-blades
propeller in Airbus A400 aircraft is given. Turboshaft engines are mostly used as
prime mover for helicopters. Few are seen in tanks and maritime applications.
Turboshaft engines have similar structure to turboprops. Both couple their gas
generator to the load through a reduction gearbox (mostly of the planetary type).
The load in turboprop is the propeller, while in turboshaft is the helicopter rotor.
Moreover, both turboprop and turboshaft engines are either single- or double-
spool engines. Few are triple spool. Hovering of helicopters close to ground
resembles an important feature, so it was treated as a solved example. Speed of
air vehicles powered by both engine types are limited to low to moderate subsonic
values.
Propfan engines have similarities with both turbofan and turboprop engines. It
combines their best features of high propulsive efﬁciency and low fuel consump-
tion. R & D for these engines started after the oil crisis of 1973. Several US
companies (GE, P&W, and Allison) cooperated to design and manufacture such
efﬁcient engines. It proved promising features but were not manufactured outside
prototype and testing numbers. The only propfan engine produced in mass
numbers is the Russian D-27 engine. A detailed example describing the thermo-
dynamic behavior and performance analysis of a pushing three-spool propfan is
given.

8.1.1
Introduction
All air-breathing engines installed in an aircraft must be provided with an air intake
and a ducting system (which is also identiﬁed as inlet or diffuser) to diffuse the air
from free-stream velocity to a lower velocity acceptable for further processing by
other engine components [1]. The intake is the ﬁrst part of all air-breathing
propulsion systems. Both of the words intake and inlet are used alternatively. Intake
is normally used in Britain, while intake is used in the USA.
Due to the inﬂuence of intake ﬂow on overall aircraft performance, responsibil-
ity for intake design rests with the aircraft manufacturer, not the engine maker.
However, both partners work closely together to arrive at an optimum solution.
Both manufacturers cooperate also in testing air intakes. An aircraft will require one
or more intakes to capture (collect) the atmospheric air (working ﬂuid) at free-
stream Mach number, sometimes change its direction of ﬂow, and supply this ﬂow
to the engine with as little distortion as possible, to ensure smooth running and
efﬁcient propulsion.
The performance of an inlet must fulﬁll the following requirements:
•
Delivers exact amount of air required for different ﬂight phases and wide
spectrum of angles of attack and sideslip
•
Diffuses air with maximum static pressure rise and minimum total pressure loss
•
Recovers ﬂow distortion or separation at large angles of attack to achieve as
uniform ﬂow as possible
•
Achieves least possible external drag to the system
•
Provides good starting and stability
•
Achieves low signatures (acoustic, radar, etc.) for a noise suppression and stealth
requirements
•
Holds minimum weight and cost while meeting life and reliability goals

Detailed aero-thermal analysis and design of intake for subsonic/supersonic and
hypersonic speeds was the topic of a lecture series organized by von Karman
Institute [2].
For gas turbine engine (turbojet, turbofan, and turboprop), the airﬂow entering
subsonic compressors or fans must be of low Mach number, of the order 0.4–0.5 or
less even if the aircraft speed is supersonic.
For a ramjet also, the inlet reduces the speed to a subsonic value to have a
subsonic combustion. Scramjet engine facilitates supersonic combustion, and thus
its intake delivers air at supersonic speeds to the combustion chamber. Thus the
entrance duct reduces air speed from ﬂight speed to lower values even for scramjet
engines.
Inlets may be classiﬁed as:
1. Subsonic or supersonic/hypersonic
2. Fixed or variable geometry
3. Two-dimensional or axisymmetric geometry
Inlet performance is either identiﬁed by isentropic efﬁciency or pressure recov-
ery. The last is deﬁned as the ratio, expressed in percent, of the average total
pressure of the air entering the engine to that of the free-stream air. The total
pressure is the sum of the static, or ambient, pressure of the air and the impact
pressure associated with its motion. Modern jet transports may cruise with values of
the pressure recovery of 97–98 %. Supersonic aircraft with well-designed, practical
inlet and internal ﬂow systems may have pressure recoveries of 85 % or more for
Mach numbers in the 2.0–2.5 range.
Noise generated in intake is another issue with extensive research list.
The intake geometry and performance are closely related to the method of power
plant installation. The position of the power plant must not affect the efﬁciency of
the air intake. In the following sections, the different methods of power plant
installation will be ﬁrst discussed for both civil and military aircrafts; next subsonic
and supersonic/hypersonic intakes will be analyzed. The performance of intakes
will be ﬁnally discussed.
8.1.2
Power Plant Installation
Power plant installation is sometimes referred to as propulsion–airframe integra-
tion. It is the process of locating the power plants and designating their installation
to meet many operating requirements while minimizing drag and weight penalties
[3]. The installation of the engines inﬂuences aircraft safety, structural weight,
ﬂutter, drag, control, maximum lift, performance and reliability of engine, main-
tainability, and aircraft growth potential. Power plant installation inﬂuences the
design of air-inlet system, cooling arrangement, and mounting structure. These
elements are largely the responsibility of the airframe manufacturer. However, the
590

engine manufacturer is also involved as the engine data must be available to the
airframe manufacturer to design a suitable installation.
Hereafter, power plant installation will be discussed for both subsonic and
supersonic aircrafts.
8.1.2.1
Subsonic Aircrafts
Power plant installations for both civil and military aircrafts are similar as long as
their ﬂight speeds are subsonic or transonic. However, for supersonic aircrafts there
are great differences in the installation methods of civil and military aircrafts as
well be described later on. Turbojet and turbofan engines have the same methods
for installation, while turboprops employ other methods.
(A) Turbojet and turbofan engines
Though most of the present-day transport (passenger or cargo) aircrafts are
powered by turbofan engines, turbojet engines still have small avenues. The
following methods are frequently seen for turbojet and turbofan engines:
1. Wing installation (Even number of engines: 2,4,6, or 8)
2. Fuselage (Even number of engines 2 or 4)
3. Wing and tail combination (Three engines)
4. Fuselage and tail combination (Three engines)
Figure 8.1 illustrates the breakdown of power plant installation for turbojet and
turbofan engines in civil applications.
(a)
Wing installation
The four forms of power plants installed to wings are the following:
(a)
Buried in the wing (2 or 4 engines)
(b)
Pod installation (2, 4, 6, or 8 engines)
(c)
Above the wing (2 or 4 engines)
(d)
Pitot installation (2 or 4 engine)
Buried in the wing
This type of wing installation is found in early aircrafts like the De Haviland
Comet 4 and the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. In both aircrafts, four engines are buried
in the wing root (Fig. 8.2).
This method of installation had the following advantages:
1. Minimum parasite drag and probably minimum weight.
2. Minimum yawing moment in case of engine failure that counteracts the asym-
metric thrust; thus, the pilot can easily maintain a straight level ﬂight.
However, it has the following disadvantages:
1. It poses a threat to the wing structure in case of failure of a turbine blade or disk.

591

2. Very difﬁcult to maximize the inlet efﬁciency.
3. If a larger diameter engine is desired in a later version of the airplane, the entire
wing may have to be redesigned.
4. Difﬁcult accessibility for maintenance and repair.
5. It eliminates the ﬂap in the region of the engine exhaust, therefore reducing the
maximum lift coefﬁcient CLMAX.

Pod installation
In this type engines are attached to the wings via pylons (Fig. 8.3). Most engines
nowadays have pod installation; either two or four engines are found in the
following aircrafts: Boeing 737, 757, 767, 777, MD-11, and future 787; Airbus
A320, A330, A340, A350, and A380; Tristar; and Antonov An-148. Six engines
power the Antonov An-225, while eight P&W TF33 turbofan engines power the
B-52.
This type of engine installation has the following advantages:
1. Minimize the risk of wing structural damage in case of engine ﬁre or blade/disk
failure.
2. Simple to obtain high ram recovery in the inlet since the angle of attack at the
inlet is minimized and no wakes are ingested.
3. Easy engine maintenance and replacement due to engine accessibility and being
close to the ground.
4. Less noisy.
5. The weight of the engines reduces the wing tip upbending effects of lift allowing
a lighter wing structure.
6. It may be a little easier to arrange for a suitable structural fuse that allows the
engine to break free from a wing–pylon under-engine seizure or other severe
event.
However, it has the following disadvantages:
1. For low-wing aircrafts like Boeing 737, the engines are mounted close to the
ground; thus, they tend to suck dirt, pebbles, rocks, snow, and so on into the inlet.

This is known as foreign object damage (FOD) which may cause serious damage
to the engine blades.
2. The high temperature and high dynamic pressure of the exhaust impinging on
the ﬂap increase ﬂap loads and weight and may require titanium structure which
is more expensive.
3. Pylon–wing interference affects the local velocities near the wing leading edge,
thus increases the drag, and reduces the maximum lift coefﬁcient. However, this
drawback can be remedied by choosing the nacelle locations sufﬁciently forward
and low with respect to the wing as shown in Figs. 8.3 and 8.4.
4. Strong yaw effect if an engine failed on one side.
Above the wing
Some of these planes are seaplanes like A-40 Albatros powered by two Soloviev
D-30KPV engines of 117.7kN thrust each plus two Klimov RD-60 K booster
engines of 24.5kN thrust. Others are conventional airplanes like Fokker VFW614
(Fig. 8.4) powered by two turbofan engines and Antonov An-74TK-200 aircraft
powered by two turbofan engines D-36, series 3-A. This type of installation has the
following advantages:
1. Prevents (or greatly reduces) foreign object ingestion into the engines from the
surface of a runway during takeoff and landing
2. Prevents water ingestion into the engine for seaplanes during takeoff and landing
3. Improves wing lift due to the blowing over of the wing’s upper surface and
inboard ﬂaps by engine streams
4. Reduces noise level at the terrain due to screening engine streams by the wing
which copes with the increasingly stringent civilian aviation noise regulations

As at present and in the future, increasingly stringent civilian aviation noise
regulations will require the design and manufacture of extremely quiet commercial
aircraft. Also, the large fan diameters of modern engines with increasingly higher
bypass ratios pose signiﬁcant packaging and aircraft installation challenges. The
design approach that addresses both of these challenges is to mount the engines
above the wing. In addition to allowing the performance trend toward large
diameters and high-bypass ratio turbofan engines to continue, this approach allows
the wing to shield much of the engine noise from people on the ground.
Pitot type
Pitot type is an ideal air intake for a turbojet engine ﬁtted to an aircraft ﬂying at
subsonic or low supersonic speeds (Fig. 8.5). Examples are Boeing 707 and Airbus
A300 aircrafts. It is a short circular intake. This type of intake makes the fullest use
of the ram effect on the air due to forward speed and suffers the minimum loss of
ram pressure with changes of the aircraft attitude. However, as sonic speed is
approached, the efﬁciency of this type of air intake begins to fall because of the
formation of a shock wave at the intake lip.
(b) Fuselage installation
As described in [3], fuselage installation (which is sometimes identiﬁed as aft-
engine arrangements) is most suitable for small aircrafts where it is difﬁcult to
install engines under the wing and maintain adequate wing-nacelle and nacelle-
ground clearances.
Pod engine installation is employed either on the sides or top of the fuselage
using short stub wings. Air gap between the engine and the fuselage minimizes
aerodynamic interference. Aircrafts are either powered by two engines (Fig. 8.6) as
in the DC-9, MD-80, Gates Learjet Model 25, Fokker F-28, Cessna 550 Citation II,
Tu-324 and 334, and Sud Aviation Caravelle 12, or four engines, as in the Jetstar
and BAC Super VC-10 (Fig. 8.7).
Fuselage installation has the following advantages [3]:
1. Greater maximum lift coefﬁcient and less drag due to elimination of wing–pylon
and exhaust–ﬂap interference
2. Less asymmetric yaw after engine failure as the engines are close to the fuselage
3. Lower fuselage height above the ground which permits shorter landing gear and
air stair length
However, this installation has the following disadvantages [4]:
1. The center of gravity of the empty airplane is moved aft, well behind the center
of gravity of the payload. Thus a greater center of gravity range is required which
leads to difﬁcult balance problems and larger tail.
2. On wet runway, the wheels kick water, and the special deﬂectors on the landing
gear may be needed to avoid water ingestion into the engine.
3. At very high angles of attack, the nacelle wake blankets the T-tail and may cause
stall which needs a larger tail span.
4. Vibration and noise isolation is a difﬁcult problem.

Fig. 8.7 Super VC-10 (4 engines fuselage pod installation)

It appears that for DC-9 size aircraft, the fuselage installation is to be slightly
preferred. In general smaller aircrafts employ fuselage arrangement.
(c) Combined wing and tail installation (Three engines)
Tail installation represents a center engine installation. Only one turbofan engine
is installed in all available tail combinations with either wing or fuselage arrange-
ment. Examples are found in DC-10 aircrafts. Figure 8.8 illustrates a typical wing
and tail installation.
There are four arrangements of center (or tail) engine installation, namely,
(A) bifurcated inlet, (B) long inlet, (C) long tail pipe, and (D) “S” bend inlet.
The two usually used are the S-bend and the long inlet conﬁgurations (Fig. 8.9).
Both installation methods have the following advantages:
1. Mounted very far aft so a ruptured turbine blade or disk will not impact on the
basic tail structure.
2. High-thrust reverser without interfering with control surface effectiveness. This
is achieved by shaping and tilting the cascades used to reverse the ﬂow.
Moreover, both arrangements also have the following disadvantages:
1. Large inlet losses due to the long length of intake
2. Difﬁcult accessibility for maintenance and repair

(d) Combined fuselage and tail installation
Examples for this type of installation are the Boeing 727 aircraft, Tu-154, and
Yak-42D. A typical layout for this conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 8.10.
(B) Turboprop installation
Turboprop (or turbo-propeller) engines, however, have limited options. The
propeller requirements always place the engine in one of the following positions
[5] (Fig. 8.11):
1. Wing installation
2. Fuselage installation, either at the nose or empennage of aircraft for a single-
engined aircraft
(a) Wing installation
Most present-day turboprops/piston engines are wing mounted to either pas-
senger or cargo transports. Either puller or pusher turboprops may be installed to
the wing. Typical wing installation of the puller type is shown in Fig. 8.12.
Examples for wing installation are De Havilland DHC-8 commuter airplane
powered by two PW120 puller engines, Fokker F-27 powered by two RR Dart
engines, and Beechcraft King Air powered by two PT6A engines (Fig. 8.12). In
some aircrafts a pair of counter-rotating propellers is installed to each engine.
Antonov An-70 is an example for these aircrafts where the aircraft is powered by
four engines.
Pusher engine types are less common; examples for pusher turboprops are Rutan
Long-EZ and Piaggio GP-166 Avanti aircraft powered by two PT6A. The latter is
shown in Fig. 8.13. An example for pusher propeller-piston engine coupling is the
famous UAV MQ-1C Sky Warrior powered by a single Thielert Centurion Diesel
engine.

Pusher propellers have the potential of a quieter ride since the propellers are
further from the passengers and because vortices from the propeller tips do not
strike the fuselage sides. However, the propellers are operating in a turbulent
airﬂow in the pusher conﬁguration (due to airﬂow past the wings moving aft in
vortex sheets), and high-velocity exhaust gases are discharged directly into the
props; thus the resulting external propeller noise is more choppy and raucous than
otherwise would be the case.

Figure 8.14 illustrates Dornier Seastar, a parasol-wing ﬂying boat, with its two
engines mounted in a single nacelle over the wings in a push–pull conﬁguration.
(b) Fuselage installation
Nose engine installation is always employed in small aircrafts. Turboprop engine
ﬁtted to the nose is shown in Fig. 8.15a. The majority of light aircrafts are powered
by a single piston engine buried in the fuselage nose, e.g., Cessna 172 (Fig. 8.15b),
Beech Bonanza, Piper PA-28R-201 Arrow, and Pilatus PC-9.
Empennage installation is illustrated in Fig. 8.16. An example for turboprop
engine is the Jetcruzer 500 with a single Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-66
(Fig. 8.16a). For piston engine, an example is Rutan Long-EZ powered by
Lycoming O-235 piston engine (Fig. 8.16b).
Finally an example for combined nose and empennage installation is employed
in aircraft Voyager (Fig. 8.17) with two piston engines, one engine buried in the
fuselage nose and the other in the aft fuselage. Both engines were installed along the
fuselage center line.
Intake of turboprop engines may have different shapes depending on size and
location of the reduction gearbox coupled to the propeller. These inlets may be
axial, axisymmetric, axisymmetric through plenum, or a scoop, which in turn

may have elliptical, rectangular, U, and annular shapes [5] as illustrated in
Fig. 8.18.
Figure 8.19 illustrates an elliptical inlet for a 6-bladed propeller of a puller
turboprop engine and a typical annular inlet.
8.1.2.2
Supersonic Aircrafts
Supersonic aircrafts are mostly military ones. Few civil aircrafts are supersonic
ones including the Anglo-French Concorde (powered by turbojet engines) and the
Russian Tu-144 (powered by turbofan engines). All the remaining supersonic
aircrafts are military ones.
(A) Civil transports
The engines of the two civil supersonic transports (SST) are installed in the
wing. Concorde is powered by four Rolls-Royce/SNECMA Olympus 593 turbojets
(Fig. 8.20), while Tu-144 is powered by four Kolesov RD-36-61 turbojet engines.

All engines are installed to the lower surface and aft part of the wing. Engine
nacelle is ﬂush to the wing surface and has rectangular inlet.
(B) Military aircrafts
Military aircrafts are powered by either turbojet or turbofan engines. Most
ﬁghters have one or, at the most, two engines situated inside the fuselage. Rather
few ones are powered by wing-type engine installation. Single engine may have
single or divided intakes (Fig. 8.21).
A variety of inlet locations and designs have been employed to supply air to
subsequent engine modules. Each of these arrangements has both advantages and

disadvantages. Figure 8.22 describes different methods for engine installation
employed on ﬁghter aircraft.
(a)
Fuselage installation
Engines installed in the fuselage may have pitot (or nose), chin, side, and
underslung conﬁgurations.
Nose (or pitot) inlet employed on the North American F-86 ﬁghter is illustrated
in Fig. 8.23. This type of installation enjoys good characteristics through a wide
range of angle of attack and sideslip and free from aerodynamic interference
effects—such as ﬂow separation—from other parts of the aircraft. The long internal
duct leading from the inlet to the engine, however, tends to have relatively high-
pressure losses.
The chin inlet employed on the F-8 and Euroﬁghter airplanes shown in Fig. 8.24
has many of the advantages of the simple nose inlet but leaves space in front of the
fuselage for radar or guns and has a somewhat shorter internal duct. The proximity
of the inlet to the ground introduces a possible risk of foreign object ingestion, and,
obviously, a possible damage of its hardware.
Side-mounted inlets may be used on both single- and twin-engine ﬁghters.
Grumman F11F is a single engine, while F-22 Raptor is a twin engine as
illustrated in Fig. 8.25. The side-mounted inlet arrangement probably offers the
best compromise of all the conﬂicting aerodynamic, structural, weight, and space
requirements, and it is used on many modern combat aircrafts.

Finally, Fig. 8.26 illustrates an underslung intake as ﬁtted to F16 airplane.
Finally, two engines may be installed to the empennage as shown in Fig. 8.27
illustrating Fairchild A-10A Thunderbolt II.
(b) Wing installation
Wing-root inlet installation shown in Fig. 8.28 is employed on the Vulcan
B-2 bomber. Inlets located in this manner offer several advantages. Among
these are short and light, internal ﬂow ducts, avoidance of fuselage
boundary-layer air ingestion, and freedom to mount guns and radar on the
nose of the aircraft. Further, no interference between the cockpit and internal

ducting is encountered in this arrangement. Careful design to avoid ﬂow
separation and associated losses must be accomplished. Wing-root inlets are
not suitable for modern ﬁghters of high-thrust-to-weight ratio because of the
large-size inlets required by these aircrafts and the difﬁculty of integrating
them with the wing.

Wing top intake is employed in the B-2’s four General Electric F118-GE-110
non-afterburning turbofans. They are buried in the wings, with two engines clus-
tered together inboard on each wing (Fig. 8.29). The intakes of the B-2 aircraft have
a zigzag lip to scatter radar reﬂections, and there is a zigzag slot just before each

airﬂow that tends to collect on the surface of an aircraft.
A unique wing installation is found in the SR-71 aircraft (Fig. 8.30). It is
powered by two turboramjet engines having a variable-geometry axisymmetric
inlet.

Electric turboshaft engines sat atop of either side of the middle fuselage having a

Side-facing intakes have a very poor pressure recovery compared to the other
two types. Thus using a side-facing intake can only be justiﬁed due to its effec-
tiveness as an inertial separator to protect against FOD [6].
8.1.2.4
Rockets
Hybrid rockets have both air-breathing and rocket engines. Air-breathing engines
may be ramjet, turbojet, or turbofan engines.
(A) Ramjet engines
The Raduga 3M-80 and 3M-82 and Kh-41/ASM-MSS Moskit are all variants of
the same 4.5-ton rocket-ramjet missile. Four intakes on the sides of the fuselage are
employed (Fig. 8.33).
Alternatively, MBDA Meteor has two rectangular side intakes. Detailed
description of ramjet missile propulsion status is described in [7].
(B) Turbojet engines
Several missiles are powered by turbojet engines (instead of the ramjet ones)
together with their basic rocket engines. Examples are the general dynamics
AGM-109H/L MRASM. It is a low-cost air-launched derivative of the Tomahawk
family. Its propulsion system is a Teledyne CAE variable speed turbojet of the
600 lb class. The power plant has ventral engine inlet/inlet duct assembly. Prior
launching the inlet is ﬂush with the missile’s skin, but deploys upon reaching a
programed point in the launch sequence.
(C) Turbofan engines
Williams F107-WR100 engine is a small turbofan engine that powers several
missiles including Tomahawk (Fig. 8.34) and Boeing AGM-86B air-launched
cruise missile (ALCM) (Fig. 8.35).

The F107-WR100 turbofan engine is embedded in the tail for both of Tomahawk
and Boeing AGM-86B missiles. Tomahawk uses a ventral engine inlet, while for
Boeing AGM-86B, the engine inlet is on the top of the fuselage. Inlet of AGM-86B
is usually shielded from GCI radars by the airframe. Prior to launch the vehicle’s
wings and vertical stabilizer are stowed. They deploy upon release from the launch
aircraft. Both Tomahawk and AGM-86B have tail cone exhaust.

Figure 8.36 illustrates Raduga Kh-55SM missile. The most visible difference
between Tomahawk and Kh-55 families of missiles is that Kh-55 uses the
two-spool turbofan engine TVD-50 which is mounted in a nacelle and stowed in
the aft fuselage. It deploys via a ventral door on a pylon after launch.
Figure 8.37 illustrates the YJ-62 cruise missile. It is also similar to Tomahawk
family but employs a unique ﬁxed scoop inlet for the air-breathing engine. It is
powered by either turbojet or turbofan engine.

8.1.3
Inlet Performance Parameters
Inlet performance is characterized by three factors:
1. Total (stagnation) pressure recovery (rd) is the ratio of the average total pressure
at the exit of the inlet to the free-stream total pressure, or
rd ¼ P02=P01
ð8:1Þ
Modern jet transports may cruise with values of the pressure recovery of
97–98 %. Supersonic aircraft with well-designed, practical inlet and internal ﬂow
systems may have pressure recoveries of 85 % or more for Mach numbers in the
2.0–2.5 range. A higher pressure recovery indicates a better performing inlet. The
maximum possible value of recovery is 1.0.
The isentropic efﬁciency of the intake is denoted by (ηd), which is static-to-total
efﬁciency and is a measure for the losses from the far upstream conditions to the
end of inlet (it is the fan/compressor face for turbine or shaft-based engines and the
inlet of combustion chamber for ram-based engines). The efﬁciency is then
expressed by the following relation (refer to Fig. 8.38):
ηd ¼ h02s  h1

Thus if the isentropic efﬁciency is known, the pressure recovery can be obtained
from Eq. 8.3, while if the pressure recovery is known, the diffuser efﬁciency can be
determined from Eq. 8.2.
However, since the ﬂow upstream of the intake is isentropic, then all the losses
are encountered inside the intake, or from state (1) to state (2). In some cases the
efﬁciency is deﬁned for the internal part of diffuser (η
0

efﬁciency is deﬁned as

2. Air distortion at intake outlet
An inlet distortion is often encountered when the real ﬂow is associated with
some degree of angle of attack to the engine nacelle. Takeoff, landing, and gust
encounter are some typical examples of such situation. The air-to-air refueling is
also one of the reasons of inlet distortion.
Such air distortion has its impact on the pressure/velocity across the exit of the
inlet, which in turn will inﬂuence the compressor/fan face for turbine-based engines
or the inlet of combustion chamber for ram-based engines. If air brought from free
stream to the compressor face is distorted, then at the exit of the inlet, one portion of
the ﬂow may have a higher velocity, or higher pressure, than another portion. The
ﬂow may be swirling, or some section of the boundary layer may be thicker than
another section because of the inlet shape. The rotor blades of the compressor move
in circles around the central shaft. As the blades encounter distorted inlet ﬂow, the
ﬂow conditions around the blade change very quickly. The changing ﬂow condi-
tions can cause ﬂow separation in the compressor (a compressor stall) and can cause
structural problems for the compressor blades and the whole engine or disrupt the
ﬂow through the engine. The simplest method for evaluating compressor distortion
takes the maximum measured total pressure minus the minimum measured total
pressure divided by the average total pressure. More sophisticated models use
mass- or area-weighted averages. Inlet distortion is an important factor because
highly distorted ﬂows cause compressor stalls that can damage the engine.
One of the strongest high-cycle fatigue (HCF) drivers can be caused by intake
distortion of the airﬂow which creates high energy, normally ﬁrst engine-order
(low-pressure shaft speed) driver. Intake distortion may be due to the operation of
the aircraft. High-yaw or sideslip maneuvers can grossly distort the inlet ﬂow.
Bifurcated intakes often create uneven pressure and velocity distributions at com-
pressor face that induce ﬂutter.

3. Inlet spillage drag is a drag that occurs when the engine cannot handle all of the
ﬂow that approaches the inlet. The airﬂow through the engine is set by choked
conditions in the nozzle. Any excess ﬂow that approaches the inlet is spilled
around the inlet generating additional drag on the airframe. The form of the
theoretical spillage drag

ranges from 0.4 to 0.7, but for a given inlet, the value is determined
experimentally.
8.1.4
Subsonic Intakes
Most subsonic aircraft inlets have a divergent shape and are sometimes referred to
as inlet diffusers because of their effect on pressure. As air ﬂows into a divergent
duct, it slows and converts some of its kinetic energy into pressure. Subsonic
intakes are found in the turbojet or turbofan engines powering most of the present
airliners and military transports (commercial and cargo aircraft). Examples of these
engines are the JT8, JT9, PW 4000 series, RB211, Trent series, and V2500
powering many of the Boeing and Airbus aircraft transports. Subsonic intakes are
also applied to some combat aircrafts and virtually all jet training aircrafts that
operate near the speed of sound.
The surface of the inlet is a continuous smooth curve where the very front (most
upstream portion) is called the inlet lip. A subsonic aircraft has an inlet with a
relatively thick lip. Concerning turboprop engines the intakes are much compli-
cated by the presence of propeller and gearbox at the inlet of the engine.
Subsonic inlets have ﬁxed geometry, although inlets for some high-bypass ratio
turbofan engines are designed with blow in doors. These doors are spring-loaded
parts installed in the perimeter of the inlet duct designed to deliver additional air to
the aero engine during takeoff and climb conditions as the highest thrust is needed
and the aircraft speed is low [8]. The most common type of subsonic intake is the
pitot intake. This type of intakes makes the fullest use of ram due to forward speed
and suffers the minimum loss of ram pressure with changes of aircraft altitude
[9]. However, as sonic speed is approached, the efﬁciency of this type of air intake
begins to fall because of the formation of a shock wave at the intake lip. It consists
of a simple forward entry hole with a cowl lip. The three major types of pitot intakes
are the following:
(a)
Podded intakes
(b)
Integrated intakes
(c)
Flush intakes
8.1
Intake
621

Podded intake is common in transport aircrafts (civil or military). Examples of
the commercial aircrafts are Boeing 707, 767, 777, and 787 and Airbus A330,
A340, A350, and A380. B-52 is an example for the military aircrafts. The integrated
intake is used in combat (military) aircrafts. An example for which is the British
Aerospace Harrier. For integrated intakes, the internal ﬂow problems are of dom-
inant concern, due to (a) the duct being longer, usually containing bends and shape
changes and (b) the presence of aircraft surface ahead of the intake, wetted by the
internal ﬂow [10].
For typical podded intakes, the friction losses are insigniﬁcant while the ﬂow
separation and minimum external drag are of prime importance. The mass ﬂow rate
and the downstream pressure are determined by engine operating conditions:
usually by the conditions at the choked turbine exit and by the operating speed of
the compressor and turbine.
Because of this variation in mass ﬂow requirements, the inlet may be operating
under suction (external acceleration) or spillage (external deceleration).
The internal ﬂow has the shortest and most direct route possible to the engine,
and its pressure recovery is almost 100 % [10]. From aerodynamics point of view,
the ﬂow in intake resembles the ﬂow in a duct. The duct “captures” a certain stream
tube of air, thus dividing the air stream into an internal ﬂow and an external ﬂow.
The external ﬂow preserves the good aerodynamics of the airframe, while the
internal ﬂow feeds the engine.
The ﬂow characteristics in podded intakes are illustrated in Fig. 8.39 for
different ﬂow conditions. Because the inlet does not have thermodynamic work,
Fig. 8.39 Flow characteristics of podded intakes
622

the total temperature through the inlet is constant. In ground run and climb
(small or zero Mach number), there will be no effective free-stream velocity
which results in a large induced ﬂow capture area causing the streamlines to
converge into the intake area. The ratio between the upstream capture area to
the inlet area approaches inﬁnite. The stream tube has a bell-shape pattern.
During climb, the free-stream velocity will be lower than the intake velocity due
to the high mass ﬂow rates required. This will also result in a larger entry
stream tube area than the intake area (a convergent stream tube pattern). At
moderate-speed cruise (M  0.45), the entry stream tube will be equal to the
intake area, and diffusion takes place inside the inlet. At high cruise and top
speeds (M0.85), diffusion takes place partially outside and partially inside the
intake.
8.1.4.1
Takeoff and Cruise Operation
Depending on the ﬂight speed and the mass ﬂow demanded by the engine, the inlet
may have to operate with a wide range of incident stream conditions. Figure 8.40
shows the performance of subsonic intake during two typical subsonic conditions,
namely, takeoff (Fig. 8.40a) and cruise (Fig. 8.40b).
For each operating condition, three plots are given in Fig. 8.36. The ﬁrst
illustrates the stream tube, while the second depicts the pressure and speed variation
and the third is a temperature–entropy diagram. The ﬂow in intakes is identiﬁed by
three states, namely, far upstream which is denoted as (1), at the duct entry denoted
by (1) and at the engine face denoted (2). The ﬂow outside the engine (from state 1
to 1) is an isentropic one, where no losses are associated with the total temperature
and pressure.
Takeoff and Climb Operation
During low-speed high-thrust operation (e.g., during takeoff and climb), the
engine will demand large mass ﬂow and the air stream upstream the intake will be
accelerated. The pressure at the inlet face is lower than the ambient pressure, so that
air is sucked into the inlet. Boundary-layer separation and compressor stall become
more likely [11]. The engine acts as a sink to the ﬂow which rushes in from a wide
stream tube, as shown in Fig. 8.39. There is then an external acceleration. Within
the inlet, the stream tube will have a divergent shape yielding ﬂow deceleration.
Many aircrafts use “bypass doors” which open at takeoff to pull in more air. In high-
speed ﬂight, these doors may slide open to let out some of the excess air and thus
reduce spillage around the lip of the inlet.
The following conditions are satisﬁed:
u1 > u1
,
P1 < P1
,
P01 ¼ P01

T01 ¼ T01
P2 > P1 , P02 < P01 , u2 < u1

623

Cruise Operation
For high speed, or cruise condition, the function of intake is to decelerate the
air velocity to that which is acceptable to the compressor/fan face. Air is
decelerated (diffused) both upstream and within the intake. Since the inlet
speed to the engine (compressor/fan) should be nearly constant for different
operating conditions, it is a favorable condition for the diffuser because the
pressure rise in the diffuser is smaller. Under these conditions the “upstream
capture area” A1 is less than the inlet area A1, and some ﬂow is spilled over the
inlet causing spillage drag. Thus losses are smaller, but external drag is
increased.

Thus, for cruise conditions, to avoid separation, or to have a less severe loading on
the boundary layer, it is recommended to have a low velocity ratio (u1=u1) and
consequently less internal pressure rise [12] while

A summary for intake performance (from far upstream to compressor/fan inlet)
may be tabulated in Table 8.1.
The serious problem is the change in M1 from zero at takeoff to about 0.8 at
cruise.
If optimized for the M1 ¼ 0.8 cruise, the inlet would have a thin lip to minimize
the increase in Mach number as the ﬂow is divided. But this inlet would separate
badly on the inside at takeoff and low subsonic conditions because the turn around
the sharp lip would impose severe pressure gradients. To compromise, the lip is
rounded making it less sensitive to the ﬂow angle, but incurring some loss due to
separation in the exterior ﬂow.
When fully developed a good inlet will produce a pressure recovery Po2=Poa

and that there are no ﬂow disturbances in or out of the diffuser. We start from the

Equation 8.9 relates the ratio of the capture area to the compressor/fan entrance
area, for the given ﬂight Mach number, M1, and the required Mach number, M2, at
the compressor/fan inlet.
Figure 8.41 shows the plot of Eq. 8.9 for various M2. It can be seen that a large
capture area is required during low-speed operations (acceleration), as noted above,
while the area ratio becomes less than one (deceleration) at normal cruise Mach
numbers.
Figure 8.42 shows the plot of Eq. 8.9 for a constant value of M2 (0.3) and
different values of inlet pressure recovery (πd).
Since the inlet resembles diffuser geometry, a quick review of the diffuser
performance is highlighted hereafter. Figure 8.43a illustrates a typical conical
diffuser. Three parameters deﬁne its geometry, namely, aspect ratio (AR), either
its wall length (L) or its axial length (N) is used as a characteristic length. The third
parameter is the divergence angle (2θ), though it is not an independent variable but
is related to other parameters by the following relation for conical diffusers:

pattern for the ﬁrst stall in the diffuser. Generally ﬂow ideally follows diffuser
contours; however, as boundary layer thickens, small separation region is ﬁrst seen

in corners. It occupies nearly (1/5) of the diffuser wall or less, and no (or little)
reverse ﬂow is encountered.
Figure 8.45 illustrates ﬁrst stall characteristics for diffusers of different geome-
tries [13]. It is clear from this ﬁgure that stall may occur in annular diffusers under
less severe geometries than in conical diffusers.

The equations governing the airﬂow are the conservation of mass, conservation
of momentum, conservation of energy equations, and some other auxiliary equa-
tions: Sutherland’s equation for viscosity and Spalart–Allmaras [14] for turbulence
modeling.
The numerical procedure follows the following steps:
1. Division of the computational domain into discrete control volumes using a
computational grid
2. Integration of the governing equations on the individual control volumes to
construct algebraic equations for the discrete dependent variables such as veloc-
ities, pressure, temperature, and conserved scalars
3. Linearization of the discretized equations and solution of the resultant linear
equation system to yield updated values of the dependent variables
Figure 8.47 shows the dimensions of the intake and following fan [15]. The axial
length of the intake is 155.55 cm, and the nose is simpliﬁed as a hemisphere of
radius 40.57 cm.
The computational domain in the study includes both the fan and the intake
zones. Due to the large dimensions of both the intake and the fan combination, it
was very difﬁcult to solve overall the domain. Since the fan includes 38 blades, a
periodic sector of an angle (360/38) was generated separately for both the fan and
the intake zones. The two zones were merged together to form the required
computational domain using Gambit preprocessor. Both the fan and the intake
zones were meshed separately and next merged using the Tmerge utility. Due to
complex geometry of both the fan and intake sectors, unstructured tetrahedral
grid is used. Number of cells for intake and fan blocks is 49,000 and 282,000,
respectively. The number of nodes for intake and fan blocks is 11,350 and
59,400, respectively.
The results of the computed airﬂow properties (Mach numbers, total and static
pressures, as well as the total and static temperatures) through intake are presented
in Figs. 8.48 and 8.49. Two ﬂight conditions are discussed: cruise and takeoff

conditions. These results include the variation of the ﬂow properties in an axisym-
metric section through the intake.
Cruise Conditions
Figure 8.48 shows the variation of the ﬂow properties at an axisymmetric
section in the intake and fan nose at the cruise conditions (11,000-m altitude,
0.85 ﬂight Mach number, and 100 % fan speed). The contours of the Mach
number are shown in Fig. 8.484a. One can observe that the Mach number varies
in both axial and radial directions. At inlet to the intake, the Mach number
decreases in the radial outward direction from about 0.5 at the center line to
about 0.2 near the intake casing. Moving axially toward the fan, the passage
convergence at nearly the ﬁrst third causes a rapid increase in the Mach number.
At this location the Mach number increases radially outward from about 0.5 to
0.67 due to ﬂow acceleration Next, the intake passage divergence results in a
decrease in the Mach number in both the axial and radial directions. At the fan
inlet, the Mach number is nearly uniform with a value of about 0.5. The
contours of static pressure and temperature are shown in Fig. 8.48b, c, respec-
tively. It is noticed that these contours have a reverse behavior compared with
the Mach number contours. The maximum static pressure (about 37.4 kPa) and
maximum static temperature (about 261 K) are shown at the fan nose stagnation
streamline.
Takeoff Conditions
The airﬂow results at the takeoff conditions are shown in Fig. 8.49. Figure 8.49
shows the contours of the Mach number, static pressure, and static temperature at an
axisymmetric section in the intake. One notices lower values of the Mach number
and higher values of both static pressure and temperature compared with the cruise
conditions given in Fig. 8.47.

8.1.5
Supersonic Intakes
The design of inlet systems for supersonic aircraft is a highly complex matter
involving engineering trade-offs between efﬁciency, complexity, weight, and
cost. A typical supersonic intake is made up of a supersonic diffuser, in which the
ﬂow is decelerated by a combination of shocks (one or more oblique followed by a
normal) and a subsonic diffuser, which reduces the Mach number from high
subsonic value after the normal shock to the value acceptable to the engine
[16]. Subsonic intakes which have thick lips are quite unsuitable for supersonic
speeds. The reason is that a normal shock wave ahead of the intake is generated
which will yield a very sharp static pressure rise without change of ﬂow direction
and correspondingly big velocity reduction. The adiabatic efﬁciency of compres-
sion through a normal shock wave is very low as compared with oblique shocks. At
Mach 2.0 in the stratosphere, adiabatic efﬁciency would be about 80 % or less for
normal shock waves, whereas its value will be about 95 % or even more for an
intake designed for oblique shocks.
8.1.5.1
Classiﬁcation of Supersonic Intakes Based on Geometry
Generally supersonic intakes [5] and [8] may be classiﬁed into two types, namely,
ﬁxed and variable geometry (Fig. 8.50). Podded installations are inappropriate for
ﬁghters.
(A) Fixed Geometry
It may have one of the following three conﬁgurations:
1. Two dimensional
2. Axisymmetric
3. Chin
(B) Variable geometry
With the maturing of supersonic ﬂight, the demands for variable-geometry
intakes and longer intake ducts gradually pushed engines further back, allowing
more room in the center fuselage for fuel over the CG. One of the aircrafts which set
the trend to fully rear-mounted engines was the MiG-21, with its short afterburner.
Since then aircrafts like the F-111, MiG-25, F-14, F-18, and Tornado have featured
this location, which ensures that the exhaust is aft of the empennage, yielding low

is on.
Variable geometry may have also one of the following three conﬁgurations:

2. Variable-geometry center body

This last one may be either variable lip angle, variable ramp angle, or variable
throat angle.
The adjustable ramps provide further compression along with the desired vari-
ation of the throat area with Mach number. The angle of the ramps varies automat-
ically in a prescribed manner as the Mach number changes.

two-dimensional (2-D) intake for F-14. SR-71 is another example for axisymmetric
intake. Axisymmetric intake uses axisymmetric central cone to shock the ﬂow
down to subsonic speeds. The two-dimensional inlets have rectangular cross sec-
tions; examples are the F-14 and F-15 ﬁghter aircrafts. For variable-geometry
axisymmetric intakes, the central cone may move fore and aft to adjust the intake
area. The inlet area in the case of rectangular section is adjusted through hinged
ﬂaps (or ramps) that may change its angles.
For ﬂight at Mach numbers much beyond 1.6, variable-geometry features must
be incorporated in the inlet to achieve high-inlet pressure recoveries together with
low external drag.
The General Dynamics F-111 airplane has a quarter-round inlet equipped with
a translating center body or spike (Fig. 8.52). The inlet is bounded on the top by
the wing and on one side by the fuselage. An installation of this type is often

Mach number changes. The throat area of the inlet also varies with the Mach
number. This is accomplished by expansion and contraction of the rear part of the

Classiﬁcation of Supersonic Intakes Based on Shock Wave
Pattern
Concerning shock wave pattern, there are three types, namely, internal, external, or
mixed compression. As shown in Fig. 8.53, three patterns for shock waves are seen,
namely, external, internal, and combined external/internal. The set of shocks
situated between the forebody and intake lip are identiﬁed as external shocks,
while the shocks found between the nose lip and the intakes throat are called

internal shocks. The third type combines both shock patterns (external and internal)
and denoted as mixed-compression intakes.
(A) External compression intake (inlet)
The forebody intake is frequently used for “external compression intake of
wedge or cone form” [10].
External compression intakes complete the supersonic diffusion process outside
the covered portion of the inlet where the ﬂow is decelerated through a combination
of oblique shocks (may be a single, double, triple, or multiple). These oblique
shocks are followed by a normal shock wave that changes the ﬂow from supersonic
to subsonic ﬂow. Both of the normal shock wave and the throat are ideally located at
the cowl lip. The supersonic diffuser is followed by a subsonic diffuser, which
reduces the Mach number from high subsonic value after the last shock to the value
acceptable to the engine. The simplest form of staged compression is the single
oblique shock, produced by a single-angled wedge or cone projects forward of the
duct, followed by a normal shock as illustrated in Fig. 8.53a. The intake in this case
is referred to as a two-shock intake. With a wedge the ﬂow after the oblique shock
wave is at constant Mach number and parallel to the wedge surface. With a cone the
ﬂow behind the conical shock is itself conical; the Mach number is constant along
rays from the apex and varies along streamline.

In a single oblique shock external compression intake, the capture area (Ac)
for supersonic intakes is deﬁned as the area enclosed by the leading edge, or
“highlight,” of the intake cowl, including the cross-sectional area of the
forebody in that plane (Fig. 8.54). The maximum ﬂow ratio is achieved when
the boundary of the free-stream tube (A1) arrives undisturbed at the lip. This

This condition is identiﬁed as the full ﬂow [10] or the critical ﬂow [8]. This
condition depends on the Mach number, angle of the forebody, and the
position of the tip. In this case, the shock angle (θ) is equal to the angle
subtended by the lip at the apex of the body and corresponds to the maximum
possible ﬂow through the intake. This is the design point for constant area. At
Mach numbers (or speeds) below the value of the critical (design) value, the
mass ﬂow is less than that at the critical condition, and the oblique shock wave
occurs in front of the cowl lip and this case is identiﬁed as subcritical. It is
notice here that
A1
Ac
< 1:0
Moreover, the outer drag of the intake becomes very large and smaller pressure
recovery is obtained. If at air speeds are greater than the design value, then the
oblique shock will impinge inside the cowl lip, and the normal shock will move to
the diverging section. This type of operation is referred to as the supercritical
operation.
The two-shock intake is only moderately good at Mach 2.0 and unlikely to be
adequate at higher Mach numbers [8]. The principle of breaking down an
external shock system can be extended to any desired number of stages. The
next step is the three-shock intake where two oblique shocks are followed by a
normal shock, where the double wedge and double cone are the archetypal forms
(Fig. 8.55).
Continuing the process of breaking down the external shock system, three or
more oblique shocks may be used ahead of the normal shock. For a system of
(n  1) oblique shocks, the pressure recovery factor will be

Two remarks are to be mentioned here:
1. As the number of oblique shocks increases, the pressure recovery factor
increases (Fig. 8.56).
2. Up to Mach 2, equal deﬂections of the successive wedge angles give the best
results, while for higher Mach numbers, the ﬁrst deﬂection angle needs to be the
smallest and the last the largest [8].
Extending the principle of multi-shock compression to its limit leads to the
concept of isentropic compression, in which a smoothly contoured forebody pro-
duces an inﬁnitely large number of inﬁnitely weak oblique shocks. In this case the
supersonic stream is compressed with no losses in the total pressure.
(B) Internal compression inlet (intake)
The internal compression inlet locates all the shocks within the covered passage
way (Fig. 8.53b). The terminal shock wave is also a normal one which is located
near or at the throat.
Fig. 8.56 Various types of intake geometry and their effect on pressure recovery
644

Stationary Modules Intakes, Combustors, and Nozzles

A principal difference between internal and external compression intakes is that
with internal compression, since the system is enclosed, oblique shocks are
reﬂected from an opposite wall which have to be considered. The simplest form
is a three-shock system. The single wedge turns the ﬂow toward the opposite wall.
The oblique shock is reﬂected from the opposite wall, and the ﬂow passing the
reﬂected shock is restored to an axial direction. A normal shock terminates the
supersonic as usual. For asymmetrical intake, as shown in Fig. 8.53b, there are four
oblique shocks. The reﬂected shocks are part of the symmetrical four-shock inter-
section system.
Again here there are three ﬂow patterns resembling critical (design), subcritical,
and supercritical cases. The inlet is said to be operating in the critical mode, when
the normal shock wave is located at the throat resulting in the highest pressure
recovery factor. In subcritical operation, the terminal (normal) shock wave is
located upstream of the throat, or in the converging part of the diffuser. Supercrit-
ical mode occurs when the terminal shock is located downstream of the throat, or in
the diverging part of the diffuser.
Subcritical ﬂow operation is an unstable mode [10]. The terminal shock may
move upstream, or ahead of the cowl lip producing a condition called unstart.
During unstart condition, the pressure recovery factor will drop, and ﬂow will spill
over the cowl, which will produce high drag.
The internal compression for the above reason, internal supersonic compression
intakes operate in the supercritical mode rather than the critical one. This represents
a margin of stability if the inlet ﬂow is suddenly changed.
(C) Mixed compression intakes
These inlets use a combined external and internal compression system
(Fig. 8.53c). In the present days, all the supersonic intakes are of the mixed-
compression type.
8.1.6
Hypersonic Inlets
Inlets for hypersonic aircraft present the ultimate design challenge. For ramjet-
powered aircraft, the inlet must bring the high-speed external ﬂow down to
subsonic conditions in the burner. Scramjet inlets are highly integrated with the
fuselage of the aircraft. On the X-43A, the inlet includes the entire lower surface
of the aircraft forward of the cowl lip. Thick, hot boundary layers are usually
present on the compression surfaces of hypersonic inlets. The ﬂow exiting a
scramjet inlet must remain supersonic. The two types of hypersonic engines are
the following:
1. All-around turboramjet
2. Above-below turboramjet
Refer to Chap. 6 for details and ﬁgures illustrating both types.

8.1.7
Performance Parameters
Supersonic intakes have the same performance parameters discussed in subsonic
intakes. It may be listed as follows:
1. The total pressure recovery, which measures the amount of the free-stream ﬂow
conditions that are “recovered.” The pressure recovery rd ¼ P02=P01
ð
Þ which
depends on a wide variety of factors, including the shape of the inlet, the speed of
the aircraft, the airﬂow demands of the engine, and aircraft maneuvers. Recovery
losses associated with the boundary layers on the inlet surface or ﬂow separa-
tions in the duct are included in the inlet efﬁciency factor ηi
ηi ¼ P02=P01
ð8:12Þ
For subsonic ﬂight speeds, these losses are the only losses. For Mach number
less than unity, the Military Speciﬁcations value of recovery is the inlet efﬁciency,
or
ForM < 1
ηi ¼ P02=P01
At supersonic ﬂight speeds, there are additional losses created by the shock
waves necessary to reduce the ﬂow speed to subsonic conditions for the
compressor.
ForM > 1

ð8:13Þ
Actual inlet performance may be greater. The magnitude of the recovery loss
depends on the speciﬁc design of the inlet and is normally determined by wind
tunnel testing.
1. There is another performance parameter called spillage drag. Spillage drag
occurs when an inlet “spills” air around the outside instead of conducting the
air to the compressor face. It is also expressed by Eq. 8.5.
2. Supersonic intakes when operating at off-design conditions also cause distortion
at the front face of engine. As the air is brought from free stream to the
compressor face, the ﬂow may be distorted by the inlet. The amount of disrup-
tion of the ﬂow is characterized by a numerical inlet distortion index. At the
compressor face, one portion of the ﬂow may have a higher velocity or higher
pressure than another portion. The ﬂow may be swirling, or some section of the
boundary layer may be thicker than another section because of the inlet shape.
The changing ﬂow conditions can cause ﬂow separation in the compressor, a
compressor stall, and can cause structural problems for the compressor blades.
A good inlet must produce high-pressure recovery, low spillage drag, and low
distortion.

the cross-sectional area of the inlet is Ai ¼ 0:4m2 . The air leaves the diffuser with a

8.2
Combustion Systems
8.2.1
Introduction
The purpose of the combustion system is to increase the thermal energy of a ﬂowing
air/gas stream by combustion, which is an exothermic chemical reaction between
the injected fuel and the oxygen in the ﬂowing stream. Combustion process takes
place in the main burner (or the combustor) and the afterburner (or the augmenter/
reheater) for supersonic aircraft.
The function of the main burner [20] or combustion chamber is to provide:
1. Complete combustion
2. Moderate total pressure loss
3. Stability of combustion process (freedom from ﬂameout)
4. In-ﬂight relight ability
5. Proper temperature distribution at exit with no “hot spots”
6. Short length and small cross section
7. Wide operating range of mass ﬂow rates, pressures, and temperatures
8. Satisfaction of established environmental limits for air pollutants
The amount of fuel added to the air will depend upon the temperature rise
required which ranges from 850 to 1700 C by the materials from which the turbine
blades and nozzles are made [21]. The air has already been heated to 200  550 C
by the work done during compression. Since the gas temperature required at the
turbine varies with engine thrust for (turbine-based engines), and engine power for
shaft-based engines, the main combustion chamber must also be capable of
maintaining stable and efﬁcient combustion over a wide range of engine operating
conditions.
8.2.2
Types of Combustion Chamber
Combustion chambers (or burners) may be classiﬁed as follows:
– Main burner or afterburner
– Subsonic or supersonic types depending on the speed of airﬂow within burners
– Direct or a reverse-ﬂow direction
Subsonic combustion chamber may be further classiﬁed into three types,
namely, multiple cans, tubo-annular, and annular ones (Fig. 8.58).
8.2.2.1
Subsonic Combustion Chambers
(A) Multiple cans
8.2
Combustion Systems
653

This type is sometimes identiﬁed as tubular or can-type combustion chamber. It
is used on centrifugal compressor engines (like Jumo 004, Rolls-Royce Nene, Dart
and Derwent, as well as Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 and PW150 turboprop
engines). It also was used in the earlier types of axial ﬂow compressor engines. It
is a direct development of the early Whittle W2B reverse-ﬂow combustion chamber
(Fig. 8.59).
The chambers are disposed around the engine, and the compressor delivery air is
directed by separate ducts to pass into these individual chambers. Each combustion
chamber has an inner ﬂame tube around which there is an air casing. The separate
ﬂame tubes are all interconnected. This allows all tubes to operate at the same
pressure and also allows combustion to propagate around the ﬂame tubes during
engine starting.
The number of combustion chamber is varying from seven to sixteen per engine.
The present trend is to have fewer numbers (8 or 10).
The advantages of the tubular type are the following:
•
Mechanically robust.
•
Fuel-ﬂow and airﬂow patterns are easily matched.
•
Rig testing necessitates only small fraction of total engine air mass ﬂow.
•
Easy replacement for maintenance.

•
High-pressure loss
•
Requires interconnectors that incur problem of light round

For these disadvantages, nowadays tubular (can) type is used in jet engines
incorporating centrifugal compressors, auxiliary power units (APUs), and

(B) Tubo-annular combustion chamber
This type may also be identiﬁed as can-annular or cannular. It consists of a series
of cylindrical burners arranged within common single annulus as shown in
Fig. 8.60. Thus it bridges the evolutionary gap between the tubular (multiple) and
annular types. It combines the compactness of the annular chamber with the best
features of the tubular type.
The combustion chambers are enclosed in a removable shroud that covers the
entire burner section. This feature makes the burners readily available for any
required maintenance. The ﬂow of air through the holes and louvers of the
can-annular system is almost identical with the ﬂow through other types of burners.
Reverse-ﬂow combustors are mostly of the can-annular type. Reverse-ﬂow com-
bustors make the engine more compact. Engines ﬁtted with tubo-annular combus-
tors include the Allison 501-K, the GE J73 and J79, Pratt & Whitney J57, J75, and
JT3 as well as RR Avon, Conway, Olympus, Tyne, and Spey. Moreover, General
Electric and Westinghouse use this type in their industrial gas turbines.

Advantages of can-annular types are the following:
•
Mechanically robust
•
Fuel-ﬂow and airﬂow patterns are easily matched.
•
Rig testing necessitates only small fraction of total engine air mass ﬂow.
•
Shorter and lighter than tubular chambers.
•
Low-pressure loss.
Their disadvantages are the following:
•
Less compact than annular
•
Requires connectors
•
Incurs problem of light round
(C) Annular combustion chamber
This type of combustion chamber consists of a single ﬂame tube, completely
annular in form, which is contained in an inner and outer casing. The chamber is

being open at the front to the compressor and at the rear to the turbine nozzles (refer
to Fig. 8.61).
Normally, this type is used in many engines using axial ﬂow compressor and also
others incorporating dual-type compressors (combinations of axial ﬂow and cen-
trifugal ﬂow). In the 1940s annular liners was conﬁned to engines of low-pressure
ratio, such as the BMW 003, the Metrovick Beryl, and the Westinghouse J30.
However, by the 1960s, the annular layout became the automatic choice for all new
aircraft engines. From this period and until now, the annular combustors were ﬁtted
to the General Electric CF6, GE90, P&W JT9D, PW 4000, RR RB211 and Trent
series, and V2500 engines. Moreover, several industrial gas turbines like ABB and
Siemens plants of over 150 MW use annular combustors also.
The advantages of annular type may be summarized as follows:
•
Minimum length and weight (its length is nearly 0.75 of cannular combustor
length).
•
Minimum pressure loss.
•
Minimum engine frontal area.
•
Less wall area than cannular and thus cooling air required is less; thus the
combustion efﬁciency raises; the unburnt fuel is reduced and oxidizes the carbon
monoxide to nontoxic carbon dioxide, thus reducing air pollution.
•
Easy light round.
•
Design simplicity.
•
Combustion zone uniformity.
•
Permitting better mixing of the fuel and air.
•
Simple structure compared to can burners.
•
Increased durability.
However, it has the following disadvantages:
•
Serious bucking problem on outer liner.
•
Rig testing necessitates full engine air mass ﬂow.
•
Must remove the engine from aircraft to disassemble for maintenance and
overhaul.
8.2.3
Components of Combustion Chamber
As illustrated in Fig. 8.62, combustion chamber has the following components:
Casing (or case)
The case is the outer shell of the combustor which has a fairly simple structure
needing little maintenance. The case is protected from thermal loads by the air
ﬂowing in it, so thermal performance is of limited concern. However, the casing
serves as a pressure vessel that must withstand the difference between the high
pressures inside the combustor and the lower pressure outside. That mechanical
(rather than thermal) load is a driving design factor in the case.
658

Diffuser
The purpose of the diffuser is to slow the high speed, highly compressed air from
the compressor to a velocity optimal for the combustor. Reducing the velocity
results in an unavoidable loss in total pressure, so one of the design challenges is to
limit the loss of pressure as much as possible. Furthermore, the diffuser must be
designed to limit the ﬂow distortion as much as possible by avoiding ﬂow separa-
tion. Like most other gas turbine engine components, the diffuser is designed to be
as short and light as possible.
Liner
The liner contains the combustion process and introduces the various airﬂows
(intermediate, dilution, and cooling; see Airﬂow paths below) into the combustion
zone. The liner must be designed and built to withstand extended high temperature
cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from super alloys like Hastelloy X.
Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling
is still needed in either cases. In general, there are two main types of liner cooling,
namely, ﬁlm and transpiration methods. In ﬁlm cooling cool air is injected from
outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin ﬁlm of cool air that
protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 K to
around 830 K. Transpiration cooling is a more modern approach that uses a porous
material for the liner, thus allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it,
providing better performance than ﬁlm cooling. Transpiration cooling results in a
much more even temperature proﬁle as the cooling air is uniformly introduced.
Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an
uneven proﬁle where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats.
More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order
of 10 % of total airﬂow, rather than 20–50 % for ﬁlm cooling). Since less air is used
for cooling, more air is available for combustion, which is more and more important
for high performance, high-thrust engines.

Snout
The snout is an extension of the dome (Fig. 8.62) that acts as an air splitter,
separating the primary air from the secondary airﬂows (intermediate, dilution, and
cooling air).
Dome/swirler
The dome and swirler are the part of the combustor that the primary air ﬂows
through as it enters the combustion zone. Their role is to generate turbulence in the
ﬂow to rapidly mix the air with fuel. The swirler establishes a local low-pressure
zone that forces some of the combustion products to recirculate, creating the high
turbulence. However, the higher the turbulence, the higher the pressure loss will be
for the combustor. Thus the dome and swirler must be carefully designed so as not
to generate more turbulence than is needed to sufﬁciently mix the fuel and air.
Fuel injector
The fuel injector is responsible for introducing fuel to the combustion zone and,
along with the swirler, is responsible for mixing the fuel and air. There are four
primary types of fuel injectors: pressure-atomizing, air-blasting, vaporizing, and
premixing/pre-vaporizing injectors. Pressure-atomizing fuel injectors rely on high
fuel pressures (as much as 3400 kPa to atomize the fuel). Simplicity is its main
advantage but it has several disadvantages. The fuel system must be robust enough to
withstand such high pressures, and the fuel tends to be heterogeneously atomized,
resulting in incomplete or uneven combustion which has more pollutants and smoke.
Air-blast injector, the second type, “blasts” a sheet of fuel with a stream of air,
atomizing the fuel into homogeneous droplets. This type of fuel injector led to the
ﬁrst smokeless combustors. The air used is just some amount of the primary air that
is diverted through the injector, rather than the swirler. This type of injector also
requires lower fuel pressures than the pressure-atomizing type.
The vaporizing fuel injector, the third type, is similar to the air-blast injector in
that primary air is mixed with the fuel as it is injected into the combustion zone.
However, the fuel–air mixture travels through a tube within the combustion zone.
Heat from the combustion zone is transferred to the fuel–air mixture, vaporizing
some of the fuel (mixing it better) before it is combusted. This method allows the
fuel to be combusted with less thermal radiation, which helps protect the liner.
However, the vaporizer tube may have serious durability problems with low fuel
ﬂow within it.
The premixing/pre-vaporizing injectors work by mixing or vaporizing the fuel
before it reaches the combustion zone. This method allows the fuel to be very
uniformly mixed with the air, reducing emissions from the engine. Fuel
autoignition is its main disadvantage, which if happens will result in a seriously
damaged combustor.
Igniter
Most igniters in gas turbine applications are electrical spark igniters, similar to
automotive spark plugs. The igniter needs to be in the combustion zone where the
fuel and air are already mixed, but it needs to be far enough upstream so that it is not
damaged by the combustion itself.
Once the combustion is initially started by the igniter, it is self-sustaining and the
igniter is no longer used. In can-annular and annular combustors, the ﬂame can
propagate from one combustion zone to another, so igniters are not needed at each
660

one. In some systems ignition-assist techniques are used. One such method is
oxygen injection, where oxygen is fed to the ignition area, helping the fuel easily
combust. This is particularly useful in some aircraft applications where the engine
may have to restart at high altitude.
8.2.4
Aerodynamics of Combustion Chamber
Aerodynamic processes play a vital role in the design and performance of gas
turbine combustion systems. The aerodynamic design of combustor provides its
size and performance analysis. In the next sections, ﬂow through diffuser and liner
holes will be thoroughly analyzed.
8.2.4.1
Aerodynamics of Diffusers
In its simplest form, a diffuser is merely a divergent passage in which the ﬂow is
decelerated and the reduction in velocity head is converted into a rise in static
pressure. Ideal diffuser achieves the required velocity reduction in the shortest
possible length with minimum loss in total pressure as well as uniform and stable
ﬂow conditions at its outlet. The different types of diffusers (Fig. 8.43) are as
follows:
1. Two dimensional
2. Equiangular
3. Straight-core annular
4. Conical
These straight-walled diffusers may be deﬁned in terms of three geometric
parameters, namely, area ratio (AR), geometrical length (either the wall length
L or axial length N), and the divergence angle (2θ). The area ratio is expressed by
the following relations:

The ﬁrst systematic study of ﬂow pattern in 2-D straight-walled diffusers was
carried out by Kline et al. [22]. As the divergence angle increased, different ﬂow
patterns were seen including no appreciable stall, transitory stall, fully developed
stall, and jet ﬂow in which the main ﬂow is separated from the wall. The ﬁrst
appreciable stall for different types of diffusers is plotted in Fig. 8.45. It was
measured by Howard et al. [13] and in good agreements with the data obtained
by McDonald and Fox [23] and Reneau et al. [24].

The Chemistry of Combustion
In this section, a brief introduction for the chemistry and thermodynamics of combus-
tion of generic hydrocarbon fuels, ( CxHy ), in which the oxidizer is the oxygen
contained in atmospheric air will be given. Atmospheric air contains approximately
21 % oxygen (O2) by volume. The other 79 % of “other gases” is mostly nitrogen (N2),
so we will assume air to be composed of 21 % oxygen and 79 % nitrogen by volume
[25]. Thus each mole of oxygen needed to oxidize the hydrocarbon is accompanied by
79/21¼ 3.76 moles of nitrogen. Using this combination the molecular mass of air
becomes 29 [kg/kmol]. The nitrogen will not normally undergo any chemical reaction.
The basic combustion process can be described by the fuel (the hydrocarbon) plus
oxidizer (air or oxygen) called the reactants, which undergo a chemical process
while releasing heat to form the products of combustion such that mass is conserved.
There are three cases for combustion depending on the oxygen percentage in the
process:
– Theoretical air (or stoichiometric air)
– Extra air (or lean mixture)
– Less air (or rich mixture)
In the simplest combustion process, (stoichiometric combustion) all the carbon
in the fuel forms carbon dioxide (CO2), and all the hydrogen forms water (H2O) in
the products.
If we supply less than theoretical air (rich combustion), then the products could
include carbon monoxide (CO); thus, it is normal practice to supply more than
theoretical air to prevent this occurrence.
Finally in the case of Excess Air (Lean Combustion) oxygen will appear in the
products.
The general chemical relation for stoichiometric combustion will be
CxHy þ z O2 þ 3:76N2
ð
Þ ! aCO2 þ bH2O þ cN2
ð8:20aÞ
The variable (z) is known as the stoichiometric coefﬁcient for the oxidizer (air).
Stoichiometric combustion is deﬁned as the complete combustion of a hydrocarbon
fuel and converted it into carbon dioxide and water vapor, in this case all the latent
heat of combustion of the fuel.
8.2
Combustion Systems
665

The general chemical relation for excess air (lean mixture) will be
CxHy þ z O2 þ 3:76N2
ð
Þ ! aCO2 þ bH2O þ cN2 þ dO2
ð8:20bÞ
The general chemical relation for less air (rich mixture) will be
CxHy þ z O2 þ 3:76N2
ð
Þ ! aCO þ bH2O þ cN2
ð8:20cÞ
Because the composition of the combustion products is signiﬁcantly different for
fuel-lean and fuel-rich mixtures, and because the stoichiometric fuel-to-air ratio
depends on fuel composition, the ratio of the actual fuel-to-air ratio to the stoichio-
metric ratio (or its inverse) is a more informative parameter for deﬁning mixture
composition. The fuel-to-air equivalence ratio Ф,

For fuel-rich mixtures

Equation 10.4a can be rewritten in terms of the fuel-to-air ratio ( f ) as
Φ ¼
f
f stoich
ð8:21bÞ
To prevent excessive temperatures at the exit of the main burner or the afterburner
and protect its walls, the overall F/A ratio must be much less than stoichiometric
ratio where Ф < 1
Example 8.7 Consider a stoichiometric mixture of propane ( C3H8 ) and air,
calculate the air-to-fuel ratio in the following cases:
(A) Stoichiometric ﬂow
(B) Less air (60 % of stoichiometric)
Solution
The general chemical relation for stoichiometric mixture will be
C3H8 þ z O2 þ 3:76N2
ð
Þ ! aCO2 þ bH2O þ cN2
Since this reaction yields four unknowns (z, a, b, and c), thus we need four
equations to solve. We obtain the four equations from balancing the number of
atoms of each element in the reactants (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen)
666

The First Law Analysis of Combustion
The main purpose of combustion is to produce heat through a change of enthalpy
from the reactants to the products. From the ﬁrst law equation in a control volume
bounding the combustion chamber, ignoring kinetic and potential energy changes
and assuming no work is done [25], we have the combustion heat expressed as:
Qcv ¼
X
p
Nphp 
X
r
Nrhr
ð8:22Þ
where the summations are taken over all the products ( p) and the reactants (r). Also
(N) refers to the number of moles of each component, and (h) in [kJ/kmol] refers to
the molar enthalpy of each component.
Since there are a number of different substances involved, we need to establish a
common reference state to evaluate the enthalpy, the common choice being 25 C
and 1 atm which is normally denoted with a superscript o.
Example 8.8 Consider the complete combustion of methane (CH4) with theoretical
air. If the enthalpy of formation of the reactants and products are as follows:

where (g

heating values of CH4.
Solution
The chemical relation for complete combustion of CH4 is
CH4 þ 2 O2 þ 3:76 N2
ð
Þ ! CO2 þ 2H2O þ 7:25 N2
Two notes can be mentioned here:
1. The enthalpy of formation of basic elements O2 and N2 is zero.
2. The Enthalpy of Formation (hfo

has negative sign means as the process is
Exothermic, i.e., heat is given off when the compound is formed.
Assume here that there is sufﬁcient heat transfer such that both the reactants and
the products are at 25 C and 1 atm pressure and that the lower heating value is
obtained when the water product is vapor, while the higher heating value is obtained
when water product is liquid.
Since there is no sensible enthalpy change, the energy equation (8.22), the higher
heating value becomes

If the products contain liquid water, then it is the higher heating value (as in the
above example); however if the product contains water vapor, then it is the lower
heating value of the fuel. The enthalpy of combustion is the largest amount of heat
that can be released by a given fuel.

Combustion Chamber Performance
A combustion chamber must be capable of allowing fuel to burn efﬁciently over a
wide range of operating conditions without incurring a large pressure loss. So, the
combustion chamber performance can be evaluated by some conditions or perfor-
mance as follows [5]:
1. Pressure loss
2. Combustion efﬁciency
3. Combustion stability
4. Combustion intensity

Pressure Losses
The sources of pressure drop or loss are either cold or hot losses. Cold losses arise
from sudden expansion, wall friction, turbulent dissipation, and mixing. Cold losses
can be measured by ﬂowing air without fuel through all the slots, holes, oriﬁces, etc.
The hot losses (fundamental losses) are due to temperature increase. Generally, the
fundamental loss due to heat addition in aero engine will be low compared with the
losses due to friction and mixing. Experiments have shown that the overall pressure
loss can be expressed by the relation

Where “m” is the air mass ﬂow rate, “Am” is the maximum cross-sectional area
of chamber, “ρ1” is the inlet density, and K1 and K2 are determined by measurement
of the performance of the system.
Typical values of PLF at design operating conditions for can, can-annular, and
annular combustion chamber are 35, 25, and 18, respectively.
8.2.7.2
Combustion Efﬁciency
The main objective of the combustor is to transfer all the energy of the fuel to the
gas stream. In practice this will not occur for many reasons, for example, some of
the fuel may not ﬁnd oxygen for combustion in the very short time available, so it
needed to deﬁne the efﬁciency of the combustion.
To obtain high efﬁciency from the combustor, the following conditions must be
achieved:
•
Fuel and air have adequate time and adequate space to mix and react.
•
Completely vaporized fuel and mixed with air before burning.
The combustion efﬁciency may be expressed as [26]

Deﬁning burner (or combustion chamber) efﬁciency is obtained from low-pressure
tests on several types of combustion chambers.
As stated in [21] and illustrated in Fig. 8.64, the combustion efﬁciency of most
gas turbine engines at sea-level takeoff conditions is almost 100 %. It is reduced to
98 % at altitude cruise.

8.2.7.3
Combustion Stability
Combustion stability means smooth burning and the ability of the ﬂame to remain
alight over a wide operating range. For any particular type of combustion chamber,
there are both a rich and a weak limit to the air/fuel beyond which the ﬂame is
extinguished.
Actually when a new system is tested, the stability limits will be investi-
gated which represent the highest and lowest fuel-to-air ratios at which
combustion will take place. Normally the limits will be well away from the
normal operating point. The range of stable operation will be reduced with the
increase of air velocity, and if the air mass ﬂow rate is increased beyond a
certain value, ﬂame will be extinguished. A typical stability loop is illustrated
in Fig. 8.65.
There are two reasons that cause instability of combustion. The ﬁrst is when the
fuel–air mixture becomes too lean or too rich such that the temperatures and
reaction rates drop below the level necessary to effectively heat and vaporize the
incoming fuel and air. The second reason is when the velocity of gas stream “U”
becomes higher than the ﬂame speed “S” which causes a blow out of the ﬂame.
Stability loops provide two basic kind of information.

Material
The walls and internal parts of the combustion chamber must be capable of resisting
the very high gas temperature in the primary zone. In practice, this is achieved by
using the best heat-resisting materials available. Normally the selected material
must withstand severe operating conditions together with the possible corrosion.
The most commonly used materials at the present are high-temperature casting
superalloy containing nickel, chromium, cobalt, and/or nickel-iron, Inconel
738/Inconel 738 LC, Inconel 939/Inconel 939 LC, Inconel 713/Inconel 713 LC,

Jet fuel or aviation turbine fuel (ATF) is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in
aircraft powered by gas turbine engines. These jet fuels are denoted as Jet-A (used
only in the USA and some parts of Canada) or Jet-A1 (used in the rest of the world).

A third type is identiﬁed as Jet B which is used for its enhanced cold-weather
performance. However, Jet B’s lighter composition makes it more dangerous to
handle. For this reason it is rarely used, except in very cold climates.
Military organizations around the world use a different classiﬁcation system of
JP (for “Jet Propellant”) numbers. It is designated as JP-i, where (i) stands for its
type and changes from 1 to 10. Some are almost identical to their civilian counter-
parts and differ only by the amounts of a few additives; Jet-A1 is similar to JP-8 and
Jet B is similar to JP-4. Other military fuels are highly specialized products and are
developed for very speciﬁc applications.
Aviation biofuel is a biofuel used for aircraft to reduce air pollution and
particularly its carbon footprint. In July 2011, biofuels were approved for com-
mercial use in aviation. Since then, some airlines have experimented with using of
biofuels on commercial ﬂights. The focus of the industry has now turned to second
generation sustainable biofuels (sustainable aviation fuels) that do not compete
with food supplies nor are major consumers of prime agricultural land or
freshwater.
•
Green Flight International was the ﬁrst airline to ﬂy jet aircraft on 100 % biofuel.
The ﬂight from Reno Stead Airport in Stead, Nevada was in an Aero L-29
Delfı´n.
•
A consortium consisting of Boeing, NASA’s Glenn Research Center, MTU
Aero Engines (Germany), and the US Air Force Research Laboratory is work-
ing on the development of jet fuel blends containing a substantial percentage of
biofuel.
•
British Airways and Solena Group are establishing a sustainable jet fuel plant in
East London, UK as BA plans to use the biofuel to power part of its ﬂeet.
•
Twenty-four commercial and military biofuel ﬂights have taken place using
Honeywell “Green Jet Fuel,” including a Navy F/A-18 Hornet.
•
In 2011, United Continental Holdings was the ﬁrst US airline to ﬂy passengers
on a commercial ﬂight using a blend of sustainable, advanced biofuels and
traditional petroleum-derived jet fuel. Solazyme company produced the world’s
ﬁrst 100 % algae-derived jet fuel, Solajet, for both commercial and military
applications.
The fuel speciﬁcation for aircraft engines is more severe than for all other types
of gas turbine.
Several requirements by different sources have to be fulﬁlled. Some are set by
aircraft and engine, others set by fuel system and ﬁnally those set by combustion
chamber itself.
Operation requirements set by aircraft and engine
It must fulﬁll the conditions: low cost and high availability; low ﬁre risk; high
heat content for maximum range and/or payload; high thermal stability (to avoid
ﬁlter plugging, sticking of control valves, etc.); low vapor pressure, to minimize
vaporization losses at high altitude; and ﬁnally high speciﬁc heat, to provide
effective heat absorption on high-speed aircraft.
8.2
Combustion Systems
673

Fuel system requirements
It includes pumping ability (fuel must remain liquid phase and ﬂow freely to the
atomizer), freedom from ﬁlter clogging by ice or wax crystals, freedom from vapor
locking, as well as high lubricity for minimum pump wear.
Combustion chamber requirements
It should be free from vanadium, alkali metals such as sodium as well as
contaminants that cause blockage of small passage in fuel nozzle, and good
atomization. It must provide rapid vaporization, minimum carbon formation and
exhaust smoke, less carbon content to avoid excessive carbon deposits in the
combustion chamber, and relatively small amount of ash.
8.2.10
Emissions and Pollutants
Recently, control of emissions has become one of the most important factors in the
design of aero engines and industrial gas turbines. The pollutants appearing in the
exhaust will include:
– Oxides of nitrogen (NOx)
– Carbon monoxide (CO)
– Unburned hydrocarbons (UHC)
– Oxides of sulfur (SOx), the most common of which is SO2
NOx emissions
The oxides of nitrogen can react in the presence of sunlight to produce “smog”
which can be seen as a brownish cloud. Oxides of nitrogen also cause acid rain, in
combination with moisture in the atmosphere, and ozone depletion at high altitudes,
which may result in a reduction in the protection from ultraviolet rays provided by
the ozone layer, leading to increases in the incidence of skin cancer. NOx emissions
also react with hydrocarbons to form ground-level ozone. NOx also cause lung
irritation and lower resistance to respiratory infections.
GE developed low-emissions combustor (LEC) on its CF6-80C, GE90, CF34,
and GP7000 engine families which used the existing case and fuel nozzles, opti-
mized mixing for reduced NOx and smoke, and controlled fuel spray and cooling to
cut unburned hydrocarbons. For a larger NOx cut, GE introduced the dual-annular
combustor (DAC) as an option for CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B engines. The DAC
has two combustion zones or stages, a rich pilot stage optimized for emissions
during ignition and low power conditions and then a lean main stage optimized for
low NOx production for high power conditions.
UHC may also contain carcinogens,
CO emission
CO is fatal if inhaled in signiﬁcant amounts. It has cardiovascular effects,
especially in those persons with heart conditions (e.g., decreased time to onset of
exercise-induced angina). It also has similar health effects on animals as on
humans.

SO2 emissions
When sulfur dioxide combines with water, it becomes the primary component in
acid rain. Many respiratory problems can be a result of SO2 inhalation.
Bronchoconstriction can be caused by any amount of SO2 larger than 1 ppm, and
10 ppm can cause eye, throat, and nose irritation which can lead to chronic
bronchitis. Much larger amounts of sulfur dioxide can be lethal. SO2 emissions
are a result of the combustion of sulfur and oxygen, and one sulfur and two oxygen
combine.
8.2.11
Afterburner
8.2.11.1
Introduction
Afterburners or augmentation devices were ﬁrst added to aircraft gas turbine
engines to increase their thrust during takeoff or brief periods of acceleration and
supersonic ﬂight [27]. In a gas turbine engine, the maximum gas temperature at the
turbine inlet is limited by structural considerations to values less than half the
adiabatic ﬂame temperature at the stoichiometric fuel-to-air ratio. As a result, the
gas leaving the turbine contains most of its original concentration of oxygen. This
oxygen can be burned with additional fuel in a secondary combustion chamber
located downstream of the turbine where temperature constraints are relaxed. The
increased total temperature produced at the nozzle by this additional heat addition
results in an increased exit velocity and thrust. The advantage of using the
afterburning gas turbine engine cycle is that the weight of the augmented engine
is much less than the weight of a turbojet engine producing the same maximum
thrust. However, when the afterburner is used for a small part of a ﬂight, the weight
reduction is more important than the increase in fuel consumption.
The afterburner as described previously is a second combustion chamber located
downstream of the turbine and is ﬁtted to supersonic aircrafts (mostly military) to
develop a greater thrust force. Afterburner consists of only two fundamentals parts:
1. The fuel injectors
2. The ﬂameholders
An afterburner is quite similar to the combustion chamber in ramjet engines.
Both have a maximum temperature much greater than conventional combustion
chambers. The gas stream enters the afterburner zone at very high speeds (250–400
m/s), and though diffused, its speed is still high enough to be blown away. For this
reason, the AB is provided with ﬂameholders downstream of the spray bars. The
ﬂameholders have the different forms. The V-gutter ﬂameholder type has been
widely used as it has the advantages of low-ﬂow blockage, low total pressure loss
(dry loss), simple, light weight, and has a good development history.
The speciﬁc design requirements for afterburner are larger temperature rise and
easy ignition.
8.2
Combustion Systems
675

Firstly the afterburner is not subjected to the physical and temperature limits as
in the case of combustion chamber. The temperature rise is limited by the amount of
oxygen that is available for combustion and limited by the liner and nozzle cooling
air. Moreover, combustion takes place easily because 75 % of the air (oxygen)
entering the AB, no longer needed for cooling, is still available for burning
with fuel.
8.2.11.2
Thermodynamic Analysis of Afterburner (Rayleigh Flow)
As a ﬁrst investigate the process of heat addition in simple, one-dimensional
channel ﬂow. The calculation will be carried out with the assumption that the
heat is added uniformly across the channel. This type of ﬂow is identiﬁed crude
approximation for the processes occurring in the combustion chamber of an after-
burner; it is convenient to Rayleigh ﬂow. With subscripts 1 and 2, identify the inlet
and outlet of the afterburner; the ratio between total temperatures and pressures at
outlet to inlet states are function of inlet Mach number. These are

Exhaust Nozzle
8.3.1
Introduction
The third stationary module to be examined here is the exhaust nozzle for any
airliner or aerospace vehicle (an aerospace plane, orbital launch vehicle, or
interplanetary spacecraft). In all cases, a nozzle is used to extract the maximum
thrust from high-pressure exhaust gases generated by the propulsion system. Figure
8.66 illustrates both convergent and convergent–divergent nozzles.
Early turbojet and turboprop engines employ simple ﬁxed-geometry convergent
nozzles.
Unmixed turbofan engines mostly employed in airliners have two nozzles for
cold and hot streams. Hot gases (core ﬂow) are exhausted from the center conver-
gent nozzle, while the cold air (fan ﬂow) is exhausted from a co-annular nozzle as
shown in Fig. 8.67. Mixing of the two ﬂows provides some thrust enhancement, and
these nozzles also tend to be quieter than convergent nozzles.
Military turbofan engines employ a single center convergent–divergent nozzle
which exhausts the mixed ﬂow from fan and low-pressure turbine.

The main functions of the nozzles are as follows:
(a)
Provide the required throat area to match the mass ﬂow and exit conditions of
the engine.

(b)
Efﬁciently expand the high-pressure, high-temperature gases at the engine
exhaust to atmospheric pressure, converting the available thermal energy to
kinetic energy.
(c)
Provide the required thrust in each ﬂight phase with a minimum installed drag.
(d)
Provide the reversed thrust when needed.
(e)
Minimize noise.
(f)
Minimize infrared radiation (IR) for military aircrafts.
(g)
Provide vectored force for VTOL and quick maneuverability of military
aircrafts.
Exhaust nozzle may be classiﬁed based on simplicity as:
•
A simple ﬁxed area
•
A complex variable area
A second classiﬁcation may be:
•
Convergent (normally employed in subsonic aircraft)
•
Convergent–divergent (C–D) nozzle (adequate performance in supersonic air-
craft as well as rockets)
Moreover, it may be classiﬁed based on geometry as:
•
Axisymmetric
•
Two dimensional
The majority of jet-powered aircrafts use axisymmetric nozzles which direct
thrust purely along the axis of the engine. Two-dimensional nozzles can direct the
thrust along the axis of the engine (as axisymmetric ones) as well as deﬂecting the
thrust to produce inclined thrust force. In later case, thrust force can be deﬂected up
and down in the vertical plane including the engine axis to develop a pitching up or
down motion of the aircraft. Examples of these are the American F-35, F-22 Raptor,
and Russian Su-37. If the 2-D nozzle is deﬂected to the right or left direction in a
horizontal plane containing engine axis, this will generate right or left yawing
motion. A nozzle combining both abilities is a 3-D type, while only one plane of
motion is a 2-D type.
The rocket has an alternative option for maneuver. Modern rockets, like the
Space Shuttle and the Saturn V, use a system called gimbaled thrust. In a gimbaled
thrust system, the exhaust nozzle of the rocket can be swiveled from side to side. As
the nozzle is moved, the direction of the thrust is changed relative to the center of
gravity of the rocket. Figure 8.68 shows three possible cases. The middle rocket
shows the “normal” ﬂight conﬁguration in which the thrust force is along the center
line of the rocket and through the center of gravity of the rocket. If the nozzle is
deﬂected to the left, then the thrust vector generates a torque about the center of
gravity and the rocket will be turned to the left. Such angle of deﬂection of nozzle is
called the gimbal angle. On the rocket at the right, the nozzle has been deﬂected to
the right, and the nose is moved to the right.

Operation of Nozzles
8.3.2.1
Convergent Nozzle
A convergent nozzle is ﬁtted to all airliners which ﬂy at subsonic or transonic
speeds. Thus it is either of the axisymmetric or annular geometry. All subsonic/
transonic turbojets and turboprop engines have one axisymmetric convergent
nozzle. Mixed-ﬂow turbofans ﬁtted to airliners have also one axisymmetric con-
vergent nozzle.
8.3.2.2
Convergent–Divergent Nozzle
Afterburning
turbofans and
turbojets are
ﬁtted
with
a variable-geometry
convergent–divergent C–D nozzle. In this nozzle, the subsonic ﬂow is accelerated
in the converging section up to the minimum area or throat. It reaches a sonic speed
exactly at the throat. Decreasing ﬂow area in the converging section results in
subsonic (Mach number < 1) acceleration of the gas. The area decreases until the
minimum or “throat” area is reached. Here the gas velocity reaches a sonic speed

Stationary Modules Intakes, Combustors, and Nozzles

(Mach number of one). Then the nozzle accelerates the ﬂow supersonically (Mach
number > 1) by providing a path of increasing ﬂow area. The variable geometry
causes these nozzles to be heavier than a ﬁxed-geometry nozzle, but variable
geometry provides efﬁcient engine operation over a wider airﬂow range than a
simple ﬁxed nozzle.
8.3.3
Performance Parameters of Nozzles
The main parameters governing performance of nozzles are as follows:
1. Pressure ratio
2. Efﬁciency
3. Area ratio
Pressure ratio in a nozzle is the ratio of outlet total pressure P0 outlet to inlet total
pressure P0 inlet. Thus
πn ¼ P0 outlet
P0 inlet
Nozzle efﬁciency is deﬁned as the ratio between the differences between total inlet
temperature T0 inlet and the static exit temperature Te and the difference between the
total inlet temperature T0 inlet and the isentropic static exit temperature Te isentropic.

It is not easy to determine the Mach number corresponding to any area ratio (A/A*),

ð8:28Þ
Area ratio for convergent nozzle is unity, while for convergent–divergent nozzles in
aircrafts is greater than unity. For rockets and space vehicles, it could be as large as
50.
The exhaust speed that can be achieved is governed by the nozzle area ratio
which in turn is determined by the design ambient pressure. Low ambient pressure
leads to a high nozzle exit area, higher gas exit velocity, and hence, more thrust.
Other design factors are nozzle weight, length, manufacturability, cooling (heat
transfer), and aerodynamic characteristics.

High-Speed Vehicles
Supersonic and hypersonic vehicles employ convergent–divergent nozzles. These
have three main types [30]:
– Cone
– Bell
– Annular
Hereafter, the main characteristics of these types will be brieﬂy described.
8.3
Exhaust Nozzle

8.3.4.1
Conical Nozzles
The conical nozzle was used in early rockets due to its simplicity and ease of
construction. The main geometrical parameters for a conical nozzle are half-angle
α, length L, and throat diameter D*. The ratio of exit to throat area is

D* þ 2L tan α

The length of nozzle is also expressed as

ð8:30Þ
The length of the nozzle is then calculated knowing the area ratio, throat diameter,
and desired nozzle half angle. Throat diameter D* is ﬁxed by combustion chamber
conditions and desired thrust. Moreover, the nozzle length and mass are strongly
dependent on α.
Figure 8.74 illustrates three conical nozzles having constant (Ae/A* ) and differ-
ent (L/D*). The longest nozzle (case a) has nearly uniform axial outlet speed. Case
(b) has almost axial ﬂow at nozzle outlet. Case (c) is the shortest nozzle, where the
ﬂow has a reasonable radial velocity component with possible separation. Soviet
nozzles look more conical.

Reducing a from 20 to 10 would more than double the length and consequently
mass of the divergent portion of the nozzle. However, small angle produces a great
thrust as it maximizes the axial component of exit velocity and produce higher
speciﬁc impulse. On the contrary, large angle reduces performance as it causes ﬂow
separation.
8.3.4.2
Bell Nozzles
Bell is the most commonly used nozzle shape. It offers signiﬁcant advantages over
conical nozzle. Concerning length, it is nearly 10–25 % shorter than conic as
illustrated in Fig. 8.75. Thus it has less weight. It has also better performance as
its contour avoids oblique shocks thus has better performance. However, its shape is
only optimum at one altitude.
Bell consists of two sections: near throat and divergent section. It diverges at
relatively large angle. Degree of divergence tapers off further downstream. Near
nozzle exit, divergence angle is very small ~2–8 [31].
Performance of bell nozzles depends on ﬂight altitude (refer to Fig. 8.76). At
optimum (intermediate) altitude the exhaust gases are ideally expanded (Pe ¼ Pa);
exhaust plume is a column-shaped producing the maximum efﬁciency. At lower
altitudes and sea level, nozzle is overexpanded (Pe < Pa), but gases do not expand
beyond Pe ¼ 0:4Pa. Exhaust plume is pinched by high ambient air pressure. At
high altitudes, the nozzle is underexpanded where Pe > Pa. The exhaust plume
continues to expand past the nozzle exit. Efﬁciency is reduced for low and high
altitudes.

Advantages of bell-shaped nozzle
1. Mechanical design is simple as tangential stresses are dominant which is easiest
to design for.
2. Cooling is easy as it is fabricated with walls of simple tubular construction that
enables cooling in a straightforward way.
3. Matching to combustion chamber is simple as it is most naturally a simple
cylinder.

Disadvantages of bell-shaped nozzle
Overexpansion case leads to both thrust loss and ﬂow instability as well as
uncertainty or unsteadiness of the thrust direction.
Generally US nozzle designs tend to have bell shapes and usually designed by
method-of-characteristics methods.
8.3.4.3
Annular Nozzles
Annular nozzles are sometimes known as the plug or “altitude-compensating”
nozzles. It recently received signiﬁcant research attention. However, it is least
employed due to its greater complexity. Plug refers to the center body that blocks
ﬂow from what would be center portion of traditional nozzle.
Annular nozzles are classiﬁed as two major types depending on the method in
which they expand exhaust, namely, outward or inward.
Radial outﬂow nozzles
Examples of this type are the expansion–deﬂection (E–D), reverse-ﬂow (R-F),
and horizontal-ﬂow (H-F) nozzles.
Radial inﬂow nozzles
Examples of this type are spike nozzles and linear aerospike nozzle for X-33.
Brief notes will be given hereafter for some of the annular nozzles.
(A) Radial outﬂow nozzles
Figure 8.77 shows an example of an expansion–deﬂection (E–D) nozzle, which
works much like a bell nozzle. Exhaust gases are forced into a converging throat
before expanding in a bell-shaped nozzle. Flow is deﬂected by a plug, or center
body, that forces the gases away from the center of nozzle which thus stays attached
to nozzle walls. Center-body position may move to optimize performance. As
altitude or back pressure varies, ﬂow is free to expand into “void” which allows
the nozzle to compensate for altitude.
Expansion ratio
ε ¼ Aexit  Aplug
Athroat
Another parameter
Annular diameter ratio ¼ Dplug=Dthroat
This ratio is used as a measure of nozzle geometry for comparison with other plug
nozzle shapes.
(B) Radial inﬂow nozzles
Radial inﬂow nozzles [32] are often referred to as
– Spike nozzles
– Aerospike or truncated aerospike
8.3
Exhaust Nozzle
693

Spike nozzle is named for prominent spike center body. It may be thought of as a
bell turned inside out. Each of the spike nozzles features a curved, pointed spike.
Spike shape allows exhaust gases to expand through isentropic process. Isentropic
spike may be most efﬁcient but tends to be prohibitively long and heavy.
Aerospike or truncated aerospike which is generated by removing pointed spike
altogether and replace with a ﬂat base. The main disadvantage of “ﬂat” plug is
turbulent wake forms aft of base at high altitudes resulting in high-base drag and
reduced efﬁciency. However, it may be alleviated by introducing a “base bleed,” or
secondary subsonic ﬂow. Circulation of this secondary ﬂow and its interaction with
the engine exhaust creates an “aerodynamic spike” that behaves much like the ideal,
isentropic spike.

Chapter 9
Centrifugal and Axial Compressors
9.1
Introduction
This chapter and Chap. 10 treat the rotating modules of both aero engines and gas
turbines. These modules are compressible turboachinery (or turbomachines). Let us
ﬁrst introduce a deﬁnition for turbomachines. The word (turbo) or (turbines) is of
Latin origin, meaning “that which spins or whirls around.” Though compressible
turbomachines may be fans, compressors, blowers, aircraft propellers, gas, and steam
turbines, only compressors, fans, and turbines found in aero engines (or gas turbines)
will be discussed in this book. Though the working ﬂuid for a compressible
turbomachine may be air, gases, vapor, or steam, only air and gases will be consid-
ered here as they are the operating media in both aero engines and gas turbines.
Fans and compressors transfer energy from a rotor to a ﬂuid, while a turbines
transfer energy from a ﬂuid to a rotor. Turbomachines are governed by the basic
conservation equations, namely, conservation of mass and energy as well as
Newton’s second law of motion (or Euler’s energy equation) for compressible
ﬂuids.
Turbomachines will be classiﬁed in Table 9.1.
Two types of turbomachinery will be analyzed in this chapter; namely:
(a)
Centrifugal compressor
(b)
Axial compressor

Brown [1] classiﬁed compressors as either intermittent ﬂow or continuous ﬂow
ones. Intermittent ﬂow compressors are positive displacement ones. They are

classiﬁed as either reciprocating or rotary types, as thoroughly discussed in Chap. 4.
Continuous ﬂow compressors are classiﬁed as either ejectors or dynamic compres-
sors. Dynamic compressors are further classiﬁed as centrifugal (radial) ﬂow, mixed
ﬂow, or axial ﬂow compressors.
Comparing intermittent to continuous ﬂow compressors, two points may be
noticed. Firstly, the pressure ratio of intermittent compressors may reach
200 while for continuous compressors it is only 20. Secondly, the mass ﬂow rate
of intermittent types is too small compared to continuous types.
Based on the previous section, dynamic compressors are identiﬁed as enclosed,
compressible turbomachinery that absorb power and mostly of the reaction type.
These may also be of the axial, radial, or mixed types. Mixed ﬂow compressors are
rarely found.

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

Dynamic compressors work by converting velocity to pressure in a continuous
ﬂow. They are efﬁcient, compact and handle large quantities of working ﬂuid.
Considering air as the working ﬂuid at 1.013 bar and 288 K, the inlet ﬂow is
typically 150 kg/s per square meter of inlet area at Mach 0.4 [2]. The intake
diameters of various types range from 0.1 m (4 in.) to 2.44 m (8 ft). The range of
mass ﬂow varies from about 1.2 to 700 kg/s. The isentropic efﬁciency ranges
typically from 0.7 to 0.9.
In this Sect. 9.2, the aerodynamic and mechanical designs of centrifugal com-
pressors are discussed. Axial compressors will be treated in the succeeding
Sect. 9.3.
Centrifugal compressors and radial inﬂow turbines are identiﬁed as radial
turbomachines. Surprisingly, radial turbomachines have a long history and predate
axial ﬂow compressors and turbines [3]. Centrifugal compressors were employed in
the ﬁrst jet engines developed by Frank Whittle and von Ohain due to the experi-
ence gained in the design of superchargers, which provided higher efﬁciency values
compared to axial compressors. With the development of aero engines, axial
compressors have nearly replaced centrifugal compressors. Thus, centrifugal com-
pressors are found in small turbofan engines such as AlliedSignal 731, Garrett
F109, GE Honda (HF120), and small turboprop/turboshaft engines such as the
Rolls-Royce DART, Honeywell Aerospace TPE33114, and the famous Pratt &
Whitney of Canada PT6. They are also found in auxiliary power units (APU) of
many civil transport airplanes such as Garrett GTCP-85 for DC8 and 9, MD-80,
Boeing 707, 737 airplanes, as well as Sunstrand Turbomach APS 200 for
Airbus A321.
Other applications for the centrifugal compressors are the aircraft cabin air
conditioning such as the Hamilton Standard 777 (ACTCS) and the multipurpose
small power units (MPSPU) represented by SunStrand Turbomach T-100. Micro-
gas turbines also resemble new application for centrifugal compressors. In a few gas
turbine engines, centrifugal compressor is used for the ﬁnal stage of compression
downstream of multistage of axial compressor. This arrangement is called axial–
centrifugal compressor similar to those in the General Electric T700 engine, Pratt &
Whitney Canada PT6, and Honeywell engine T53 [4].
Centrifugal compressors in aero engines provide small to moderate air ﬂows
(up to nearly 50 kg/s). They have either single or double stages (sometimes
identiﬁed as impellers in tandem). The pressure ratio per stage ranges from 4:1 to
8:1; while for double (two) stages in series, a pressure ratio of 15:1 is found in Pratt
& Whitney PW100.
Centrifugal compressors are used in many industrial applications such as reﬁn-
eries, chemical and petrochemical plants, natural gas processing and transmission
plants, very large-scale refrigeration, and iron and steel mills. Two other important
applications for centrifugal compressors are air-conditioning and refrigeration and
HVAC and automotive engine turbochargers (GTCP-85) and superchargers.
Comparing centrifugal and axial compressor, we can say that centrifugal com-
pressors have the following advantages: light weight, low cost, rigidity, high
pressure ratio per stage, easily made in relatively small sizes (thus suitable for

handling small volume ﬂows), simplicity, better resistance to foreign object damage
(FOD), less susceptibility to loss of performance by buildup of deposits on the blade
surfaces, and the ability to operate over a wider range of mass ﬂow at a particular
speed. The disadvantages of the centrifugal compressor are that it is generally less
efﬁcient than axial compressor (perhaps 4–5 % less), and it has a larger cross
section (frontal area) compared with the cross section of the inlet ﬂow.
Comparing centrifugal compressors to piston compressors, we can also say that
centrifugal compressor has not any parts that perform reciprocating movement,
consequently centrifugal compressor has very quiet run. In view of its quiet run and
because centrifugal compressor has not any part that appose, except of bearings,
centrifugal compressor is very reliable. Next advantage is the fact that speciﬁc mass
of centrifugal compressor is decreasing with its increasing capacity.
In conclusion, we can say that design of centrifugal compressor is interdisci-
plinary process including aerodynamics, thermodynamics, stress analysis, vibration
analysis, selection of materials, and so on. During design stage, possibilities and
requirements of manufacturing must be taken into account.
9.2.2
Layout of Compressor
Generally centrifugal compressor is called so because the ﬂow through the com-
pressor is turned perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This type of compressors is
composed of three main elements, namely:
1. Rotating part or impeller
2. Stationary part or stator
3. Manifold or a collector (denoted by scroll or volute)
9.2.2.1
Impeller
Air is drawn at the center or eye of the impeller, then accelerated through the fast
spinning speed of the impeller and ﬁnally thrown out at tip. At the eye (inlet), the
vanes are curved to induce the ﬂow: this axial portion is called the inducer or
rotating guide vanes and may be integral with or separated from the main impeller.
These vanes are cast, forged, or machined integrally with the impeller hub. The
number of vanes is usually a prime number, typically from 19 to 37, to avoid
vibration problems [2]. The outer curve of the vanes is sealed by the shroud, which
may be part of the stationary structure or may rotate with the rotor. Typical impeller
proportions are that the eye root diameter is about half the eye tip diameter, and the
tip (outlet) diameter is nearly twice the eye tip diameter. The impeller material is
often aluminum, with titanium or steel for smaller, high-duty machines.

9.2.2.2
Diffuser
The diffuser represents a part of the ﬁxed structure of the compressor that reduces
the kinetic energy, thereby increases the static pressure. The diffuser is either a
vaneless passage or a vaneless passage followed by a vaned section. The vaned
diffuser represents a large group including the vanes together with the cascade,
channel, and pipe types; Fig. 9.2 [2].
All diffusers have an initial vaneless gap outboard of the impeller in which the
ﬂow settles. The vaneless diffuser is bulky and can be inefﬁcient in comparison to
the other types. The cascade may involve one, two, or three rows of vanes, with
performance similar to that of axial cascades. Vaned diffusers may use curved or
straight vanes, having a longer path length than the cascade diffuser. Vaned diffuser
may be made variable, the vanes pivoting about an axis as shown in Fig. 9.2 to

stations of a centrifugal

accommodate different incident ﬂow angles through the speed range. Vaneless,
cascade, and vaned diffusers collect the ﬂow in a one volute type collector, which is
suitable for industrial applications.
Channel and pipe diffusers are suitable for aero engines and gas turbines. Both
diffusers collect the ﬂow in separate passages that diverge slowly. The pipe consists
of a conical hole while the channel has a rectangular section with one pair of
opposed walls diverging at 10–11 while the others are parallel. The pipe and
channel diffusers may feed separate combustors or may merge downstream.
Recently, it had been shown that the pipe-type diffuser is more efﬁcient than the
conventional rectangular channels [4]. Overall isentropic efﬁciencies of over 85 %
are claimed for compressors using new pipe diffuser.
9.2.2.3
Scroll or Manifold
The ﬁnal element of centrifugal compressors is either a manifold or a scroll.
Centrifugal compressors with manifolds are used when the compressor is a part
of a gas generator – in either a gas turbine or an aero engine – and thus the
compressor is followed by a combustion chamber. In case of industrial applications,
including oil and gas industry, chemical industries and petrochemicals, etc., the
working ﬂuid is collected in a scroll or volute. The working ﬂuid leaving the stators
is collected in a spiral casing surrounding the diffuser called a volute or scroll. The
area of the cross section of the volute increases along the ﬂow path in such a way
that the velocity remains constant. The possible shapes of volute are shown in
Fig. 9.3.

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

1. Single or multiple stages: For aero engines, centrifugal compressors have either
single stage or double (two or tandem) stages. In some cases, two (or double)
stages are mounted on the same shaft, handling the ﬂuid in series to boost its
ﬁnal pressure. In industrial gas turbines such as pipeline compressors, there are
up to ﬁve stages.
2. Single entry (or single-face) or double (dual) entry (or double-face): The princi-
pal differences between the single entry and dual entry are the size of the impeller
and the ducting arrangement. The single-entry impeller permits ducting directly
to the inducer vanes, as opposed to the more complicated ducting needed to reach
the rear side of the dual-entry type; ﬁgure (9.4). Although slightly more efﬁcient
in receiving air, single-entry impellers must be of greater diameter to provide
sufﬁcient air. Dual-entry impellers are smaller in diameter and rotate at higher
speeds to ensure sufﬁcient airﬂow. Most gas turbines of modern design use the
dual-entry compressor to reduce engine diameter.
3. Shrouded or unshrouded impeller: Unshrouded impeller means that there is a
clearance between the ends of the impeller vanes and a stationary shroud, while
shrouded impeller means that there is a rotating shroud ﬁxed to the impeller
vanes. Shrouding reduces the losses due to leakage of air from the pressure side
to the suction side of the blade. However, it increases the friction and weight of

the impeller. For gas turbine and turbocharger applications, the impeller is
usually unshrouded and the stationary cover is referred to as the shroud. For
large process compressors, the impeller is often constructed with an integral
shroud.
4. The impeller may have a non-, semi-, and full-inducer section. For full-inducer
impeller, the impeller vanes are continued around into the axial direction and
the compressor resembles an axial compressor at inlet.
5. The impeller vanes may be radial at outlet or they may be inclined backward or
forward, thus identiﬁed as backward-leaning (commonly now described as
backswept) or forward-leaning compressor.
6. The impeller layout may be open, semi-closed, or closed. Open type is built
with blades in a radial direction without enclosing covers on either front or
backsides, normally found in turbochargers. Semi-closed types are built with
blades in a radial direction with an enclosed cover on the backside that extends
to the periphery of the blades, normally found in air compressors. The closed
type is built with backward- or forward-leaning blades and has enclosing
covers on both the front and backside, normally found in multistage
compressors.
7. Impeller may include only full vanes or full plus half vanes (splitter blades).
Such splitter blades are located toward the tip to improve the ﬂow pattern where
the full vanes are widely spaced.
8. Intake or inlet passage to the compressor may or may not be ﬁtted with inlet
guide vanes (IGV). IGVs are designed to give either positive or negative
prewhirl. IGVs giving a positive prewhirl are frequently found in high-speed
compressors, say in aero engines, to minimize the possibility of air reaching or
exceeding the sonic speed. In this case, possible shock waves formed will lead
to great losses in the intake. Negative prewhirl is employed to increase the inlet
relative speed at some applications. These IGVs may also be set at ﬁxed angle
or they can be rotated to vary the inlet ﬂow angle.

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

9. Outlet through a collector (denoted as scroll or volute) or a manifold. In the
aviation ﬁeld, the air leaving the compressor must be directed toward the
combustion chamber with the minimum ducting losses. The diffuser is either
constructed or ended by a 90 bend to satisfy this requirement. If the compres-
sor is used in other industrial applications, then the air leaving the successive
passages of the stators is collected in a scroll or volute and ducted from a
single pipe.
10. Exit may or may not be ﬁtted with exit guide vanes (EGVs).
11. The casings of the compressor may be horizontally split casings, vertically split
casings, or bell casings.
9.2.4
Governing Equations
Aero-thermodynamic relations that govern the ﬂow in centrifugal compressors will
be discussed here. In turbomachinery, normally its analysis relies upon the follow-
ing steps:
1. Identify a control volume for the module or stage and locate different states
2. Plot the processes within turbomachines on both of temperature-entropy (T-s)
and pressure-volume (P-v) charts or one of them
3. Draw velocity diagrams at inlet and outlet states of rotor (or impeller)
4. Write down the governing equations, namely, gas law (or equation of state),
conservation of mass (or continuity equation), conservation of energy (or energy
equation), and Newton’s second law (or force-balance equation)
Layout of centrifugal compressor shown in Fig. 9.1 deﬁnes three states, namely,
the impeller inlet (state 1), impeller outlet (state 2), and diffuser outlet (state 3).
These states are also plotted on the T–S diagram in Fig. 9.5. Each state is deﬁned by
two points, namely, the static and total (stagnation) conditions. Thus, two pressure
lines (static and total) are seen for each state. The compression processes are
assumed adiabatic irreversible; thus entropy increase is found in each process.
The velocity triangles at the inlet and outlet of the impeller are shown in Fig. 9.6.
The velocity triangles in any turbomachine are governed by the relation
~C ¼ ~U þ ~W
ð9:1Þ
where ~C, ~U, and ~W are the absolute, rotational, and relative velocities, respectively.
The inlet velocity triangle is drawn in the axial–tangential plane. As shown in
ﬁgure, the ﬂow approaching the eye may be axial (C1) with a typical velocity of
150 m/s for air or may have a swirl angle (in case of prewhirl as will be discussed
later). The rotational speed is (U1) which varies with radii from eye hub to tip since
(U1). The relative velocity is (W1), which varies in magnitude and direction from
eye hub to tip due to variation of (U1). This requires the inducer vane to be twisted
to align with the ﬂow at all radii. It is normal for the relative Mach number at the

eye tip to be below 0.9, which falls to below 0.5 for most of the subsequent passage
length to minimize frictional losses. At the impeller outlet, the air leaves the
passage with a relative velocity (W2), which when added vectorially to the tangen-
tial speed (U2), will give the absolute velocity (C2). This absolute velocity (C2) is
greater than (C1) as a result of the work input to the rotor shaft. It is interesting to
note here that the outlet velocity triangle is at another plane, namely, the radial–
tangential plane. As shown in Fig. 9.6, the tip tangential velocity (U2) at outlet is
equal to the whirl velocity (Cu2). However, in most cases, (U2) is slightly greater
than (Cu2) and the difference is called the slip.
Changes in thermodynamic properties and velocities at the three states of the
compressor are summarized in Table 9.1. At state (1), impeller inlet, the static and
total temperatures are T1 and T01, while the static and total pressures are P1 and P01.
The absolute, relative, and rotational velocities are C1, W1, and U1.
Same symbols are used in state (2). Since state (3) resembles a stator outlet, there
will be neither rotational or relative speeds (U, W).
As described in Table 9.2, both the total temperature and total pressure increase
in the impeller due to energy addition to the air. Moreover, since the impeller is a
rotating diffuser then the static pressure rises while the relative speed decreases
(W2 < W1). Moreover, the diffuser converts the kinetic energy into pressure energy.
Thus, the total temperature at the inlet and outlet of the stator are equal from the ﬁrst
law of thermodynamics, while the outlet total pressure is less than the inlet total
pressure due to friction. The static pressure rises in the diffuser while the absolute
velocity decreases as found in any diffusing passage.

Where, (ηc) is the isentropic efﬁciency of compressor. Generally, two approaches
are used for determining stage efﬁciency at the preliminary design stage.
•
An approach that at ﬁrst sight appears to be less dependent upon empiricism is to
formulate a general 1D compressor model that includes some loss estimation for
the principal ﬂow elements of the stage.
•
The most comprehensive method includes models for IGV, impeller, vaneless
space and vaned diffuser. The loss models are tuned so that the method obtains
reasonable agreement with a representative range of test cases.
Switching to the governing equations for a moving ﬂuid, these will be:
1. Conservation of mass or continuity equation
2. Momentum equation or Newton’s second law
3. Conservation of energy or the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
These equations will be examined hereafter.
9.2.4.1
Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation)
For a steady ﬂow, the mass rates of ﬂuid entering and leaving a control volume are
identical. Thus, considering a control volume between the impeller inlet (State 1)
and outlet (State 2), the continuity equation is written as

where ρ2 and Cr2 are the density and radial velocity at the impeller tip, n is the

axial width of the impeller.
9.2.4.2
The Momentum Equation or Euler’s Equation
for Turobmachinery
Newton’s second law of motion applied to the ﬂuid passing through a control
volume states that the rate of change of momentum of the ﬂuid is equal to the net
applied force on the ﬂuid in the control volume, or
~F ¼ d
dt m~C


For a steady ﬂow between States 1 and 2, this can be written as
~F ¼ _m
~C2  ~C1


The above equation is used to obtain the torque arising from the net force, which is
related to the angular momentum of the ﬂuid within the control volume by multi-
plying the above equation by the appropriate radii; thus:
~T ¼ ~r 	 ~F ¼ _m
~r2 	 ~C2  ~r1 	 ~C1


The above vectorial equation is reduced to the following scalar relation for the
torque about the axis of rotation:

From the above relation, it is justiﬁed to say that centrifugal compressor has the
following performance characteristics, often called “the three fan laws”:
1. Flow is proportional to impeller speed.
2. Pressure ratio across an impeller is proportional to the square of the impeller
speed.
3. Power absorbed by the impeller varies with the cube of the impeller speed.
9.2.5
Slip Factor (σ)
If the ﬂow at impeller discharge is perfectly guided by the impeller blades, then the
tangential component of the absolute velocity (swirl velocity) is equal to the
rotational velocity (Cu2 ¼ U2) in the case of radial type impeller. In practice, the
ﬂow cannot be perfectly guided by a ﬁnite number of blades and it is said to slip.
Thus, at the impeller outlet, the swirl velocity is less than the impeller rotational
speed (Cu2 < U2). The classical explanation for the slip phenomenon [3] uses the
concept of the relative eddy. As the ﬂow into the impeller is normally irrotational,
that is, has no initial rotation, then at the impeller discharge the ﬂow relative to the
impeller must rotate with an angular velocity equal and opposite to the impeller;
Fig. 9.7.
By combining this relative eddy and the radial through ﬂow, the resultant
relative velocity vector has a component in the direction opposite to the impeller
rotation.
The slip factor is denoted by σ and is deﬁned as
σ ¼ Cu2
U2
ð9:15Þ
Though Stodola and Busemann derived formulae for this slip factor, the correlation
proposed by Staintz [5] has a wide range of application. Stanitz formula is
expressed as

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

σ ¼ 1  0:63π
n
ð9:16Þ
where n is the number of blades. It was considered satisfactory for both radial
blades, forward- and backward-leaning blades having blade angles ranging from
45 to +45. As the number of vanes of impeller is increased, then the slip factor is
also increased; slip lag at the tip of the impeller reduces.
The effect of slip is to reduce the magnitude of the swirl velocity from the ideal
case. This in turn will reduce the pressure ratio. In this way, slip will also reduce the
compressor power consumption. The detrimental effect of slip is that the impeller
must be larger or the rotational speed must be higher to deliver the same pressure
ratio. This leads to increased stress level and it will also lead to increased relative
velocity that will lead to increased friction loss and a reduced efﬁciency.

Further discussions for Power Input factor, Slip Factor and Efﬁciency will be
given here:
•
Power input factor and slip factor are neither independent of one another nor of
efﬁciency.
•
The power input factor represents an increase in the work input above that
needed for deriving the impeller (rotating element) of compressor.
•
This increment increase is absorbed in overcoming frictional loss
•
Power input factor should be as close as possible to unity.
•
Low values of power input factor imply that the impeller is very efﬁcient.
•
However, the value of compressor efﬁciency also depends on friction losses in
the diffuser which does not affect power input factor.
•
The slip factor limits the capacity of the compressor and this should be as high as
possible.
•
A high value of slip factor requires higher number of vanes.
•
Higher number vanes will increase frictional losses and hence increase the value
of power input factor and decrease the value of efﬁciency.
•
A suitable compromise must be found, and present day practice is 19–21 vanes
to get a slip factor value of 0.9.
Historical trends showed that its value was 70 % in 1950, raised to 75 % in 1960,
then to 82 % in 1980, reached 85 % in 2000, and ﬁnally scored 87 % by 2010. Its
projected value is 90 % in 2040.
Equations (9.5) through (9.16) are assembled in Table (9.3) as a conscious quick

Types of Impeller
The impeller may also be classiﬁed based on blading into three types, namely,
straight radial, forward leaning, or backward leaning. Figure 9.8 shows three types
schematically, together with typical velocity triangles in the radial plane for the
outlet of each type. The three velocity triangles have the same rotational speed U2
and same radial velocity component Cr ¼ Wr. As a ﬁrst approximation, the relative
ﬂuid velocity leaving the impeller W2 is assumed parallel to the blade. The angle of

the blade at exit with respect to the tangential direction is denoted by (β2) and is

of the absolute velocity is

At the same mass ﬂow rate and tip speed, U2, the rotor with forward-leaning blades
will do more work on the ﬂuid. Thus, at the ﬁrst sight it looks that it will produce the
highest pressure ratio compared to the radial or backward-leaning blades. However,
its positive slope is not an advantageous as the higher pressure ratio and tempera-
ture rise will lead to dynamic instability [6]. Moreover, the resulting absolute
velocity at exit C2 is maximum (for the same Wr2 and U2), which increases the
necessary pressure rise in the diffuser. For these reasons, forward-leaning blades are
not suitable for high-speed compressors and never used for aircraft engines. For
radial blades (β2 ¼ 0.0), a horizontal line is obtained, which means that the pressure
ratio is independent from the mass ﬂow rate. For backward-leaning (backswept)
blades, the above relation yields a straight line having a negative slope. Since the
absolute velocity (C2) for backward is less than that for both straight radial and
backward-leaning blades, it develops higher efﬁciency than straight radial blades.
This means less stringent diffusion requirements in both the impeller and the
diffuser, tending to increase the efﬁciency of both components [5]. The backswept
angle may be in the range 30–40. The use of backswept vanes gives the compres-
sor a wider operating range of the airﬂow at a given rotational speed, which is
important for matching the compressor to its driving turbine.

A comparison between different impellers is given in Table 9.5.
It is important to say here that impeller’s tip speed not only inﬂuencing aerody-
namics of compressor but also its allowable stresses. Maximum tip speed depends
on impeller’s material as follows:
•
Cast aluminum can be used up to a tip speed of around 200–300 m/s.
•
Forged machined aluminum can be used up to a tip speed of about 500 m/s.
•
Titanium can be used up to a tip speed of 650–700 m/s.
Titanium aluminide and titanium metal matrix composites are currently being
researched for the higher tip speeds.

This value is greater than the pressure ratio of the compressor due to the losses in
the diffuser.
The impeller isentropic efﬁciency is related to the compressor efﬁciency. Now,
if the losses in the impeller are equal to a certain fraction of the total losses, say λ,
then from the T–S diagram (Fig. 9.5), the impeller loss and the compressor loss are,
respectively, (T02  T02SS) and (T02  T03SS).

Radial Impeller
Impeller has no inducer section. The blade starts and ends in the radial plane. Thus
both velocity triangles are drawn in the (r  θ) plane. Figure 9.10 illustrates both

Diffuser
The function of the diffuser is to decelerate the ﬂow leaving the impeller, thus
reducing the absolute velocity of the gas at impeller exit from (C2) to a lower
velocity (C3) as shown in Fig. 9.5. The static pressure of the air/gas at impeller exit
is further raised by passing through the diffuser. The amount of deceleration and the
static pressure rise (P3  P2) in the diffuser depend on the degree of reaction and the
efﬁciency of the diffusion process. An efﬁcient diffuser must have minimum losses
(P02  P03) but maximum efﬁciency.
There are broadly two types of diffuser, namely, vaneless and vaned. The vaned
diffuser has many types, including not only the diffuser having ﬁxed or pivoting
vanes but also the cascade, channel, and pipe types; Fig. 9.2. All diffusers have an
9.2
Centrifugal Compressor
735

initial vaneless gap outboard of the impeller in which the ﬂow settles. The vaneless
diffuser is bulky and can be inefﬁcient compared with the other types. The cascade
may involve one, two, or three rows of vanes, with performance similar to that of
axial cascades. Vaned diffusers may use curved or straight vanes, having a longer
path length than the cascade diffuser. Vaneless, cascade, and vaned diffusers collect
the ﬂow in a one volute type collector. The channel and pipe diffusers collect the
ﬂow in separate slowly diverging passages, sometimes with corner vanes at their
outlet. The pipe diffuser consists of a conical hole while the channel type being
rectangular in section with one pair of opposed walls diverging at 10–11 while the
others are parallel.
The pipe and channel diffusers may feed separate combustors or may merge
downstream. The channel type is sometimes known as the vane-island or wedge-
type diffuser. The blunt end causes as much loss as 5 % of the overall efﬁciency.
The pipe-type diffuser is more efﬁcient than the rectangular channels. The passages
are formed by drilling holes tangentially through a ring surrounding the impeller,
and after the throat the passages are conical. Overall isentropic efﬁciencies of over
85 % are obtained for compressors using this pipe diffuser. Of all the types of
diffuser, the vaned diffuser may be made variable, the vanes pivoting about an
axial axis.
In general, the performance of diffuser is examined by considering the pressure
coefﬁcient
Cp ¼ P3  P2
P02  P2
ð9:23Þ
where stations 2 and 3 are the inlet and outlet of the diffuser, respectively. The
pressure coefﬁcient is sometimes identiﬁed as the pressure rise coefﬁcient and
given by the symbol Cpr.
9.2.9.1
Vaneless Diffuser
As the name implies, the air/gas in a vaneless diffuser is diffused in the vaneless
space around the impeller before it leaves the stage of compressor through a volute
casing. The air/gas in the vaneless diffuser gains static pressure rise simply due to
the diffusion process from a smaller diameter (d2) to a larger diameter (d3). The
corresponding areas of cross sections in the radial direction are
A2 ¼ πd2b2 ¼ 2πr2b2
A3 ¼ πd3b3 ¼ 2πr3b3
ð9:24Þ
Such a ﬂow in the vaneless space is axisymmetric inviscid. Since no external torque
is applied, the angular momentum is constant, or
r2Cu2 ¼ r3Cu3
ð9:25Þ
From the continuity equation, at the entry and exit section of the vaneless diffuser,

∴Cu3

Equation (9.28) shows that for incompressible ﬂuid, the diffusion is directly propor-
tional to the diameter ratio (d3/d2). This leads to a relatively large-sized diffuser,
which is a serious disadvantage of the vaneless type, which leads to an impractically
large compressor to be used in aeronautical applications. Moreover, Eq. (9.28) gives
α2 ¼ α3 ¼ tan 1 Cu2
Cr2
¼ tan 1 Cu3
Cr3

ð9:29Þ
Thus, the streamlines for incompressible ﬂow in a vaneless diffuser of constant
axial width make a constant angle with the radial direction α.

Vaned Diffuser
To save space, vanes are employed to reduce the ﬂuid angular momentum and
thereby reduce Cu more rapidly. Conical diffusers are mostly used in aircraft
engines.

9.2.10
Prewhirl
The tangential component of velocity at the inlet to the impeller is usually zero as
the ﬂow enters the impeller axially. If prewhirl (or inlet guide) vanes are installed to
9.2
Centrifugal Compressor
737

the inlet duct before the impeller, then the incoming air has a tangential component
of velocity. This velocity component depends on the vane outlet angle. Prewhirl
may be positive or negative as shown in Fig. 9.11.
Positive prewhirl reduces the inlet relative velocity, while negative prewhirl
increases the inlet relative velocity. In aero engines, positive prewhirl is frequently
used to reduce the inlet relative speed. The objective here is to avoid the formation of
shock waves on the blade suction side. The designer of compressor seeks for a small
inlet area of the engine to reduce the drag force. At the same time, the air mass ﬂow
rate is chosen as maximum as possible to maximize the thrust force. Both factors led to
an increase in the axial absolute velocity at inlet, and this in turn increases the relative
velocity. Since the relative velocity is maximum at the tip radius of the inlet then when
accelerated, there is always a tendency for the air to break away from the convex face
of the curved part of the impeller vane. Here a shock wave might occur, which upon
interaction with the boundary layer over the convex surface of blades, causes a large
increase in boundary layer thickness. Thus, excessive pressure loss occurs.
The value of the inlet relative Mach number must be in the range from 0.8 to 0.85
to avoid the shock wave losses described previously, or
M1 ¼
W1
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
γRT1
p
 0:8  0:85
where T1 is the static inlet temperature. Though this Mach number may be satis-
factory on ground operation, it may be too large at high altitudes as the ambient
temperature decreases with altitude. For this reason, IGVs are added to decrease the
Mach number. These IGVs are attached to the compressor casing to provide a
positive prewhirl that decreases the magnitude of the maximum relative velocity
(W1) at the eye tip.
The IGVs, sometimes denoted as swirl vanes, may swivel about radial axes to
vary the swirl angle with speed. Keeping W1 aligned with the inducer leading edge
results in a minimum incidence or shock losses. Thus, they widen the operating
speed range, increase efﬁciency, and reduce the relative Mach number at the eye
tip, but they also reduce the mass ﬂow by reducing the inlet area.
Assuming that the axial velocity is uniform from the root to the tip of the eye,
then the maximum relative Mach number at the eye tip; Fig. 9.11 is given by the
relation:
M1max ¼ W1max

γRT1
s
ð9:31Þ
where U1t is the rotational speed at the eye tip and (α1) is the prewhirl angle,
which is the angle between the absolute velocity leaving the IGV and the axial
direction.
Another advantage of the prewhirl is that the curvature of the impeller vanes at
the inlet will be reduced and so the radius of curvature will increase. Thus, the
738

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

bending stress is decreased. The reason is that the inducer of the impeller resembles
a curved beam. The bending stress for curved beams is inversely proportional to the
radius of curvature [8].
Example 9.4 An aircraft engine ﬂying at 10,500 m is ﬁtted with a single-sided
centrifugal compressor. At the compressor inlet, the total pressure and temperature
are P01 ¼ 0.34 bar and T01 ¼ 243 K, axial speed is Ca1 ¼ 120 m/s and rotational
speed is 270 rps. The intake duct of the impeller eye contains ﬁxed vanes, which
give the air a positive prewhirl of α1 ¼ 25 at all radii. The inner and outer diameters
of the eye are 18 and 33 cm, respectively; the diameter of the impeller periphery is
54 cm. Assuming that the impeller has radial blades at outlet, isentropic efﬁciency
of the compressor is 0.8, the slip factor is 0.9, and the power input factor is 1.04,

Discharge System
The discharge system as described earlier is either a manifold, a crossover duct
(an inverted U-shaped passage), or a collector (scroll or volute). Aero engines and
many gas turbines require the discharged air to be turned into axial direction for
transmission to the combustion chamber. Multistage compressors have inverted
U-shaped passage to turn the ﬂow from radially outward to radially inward, and
then to axial direction for transmission to the inlet of the next stage. In many
industrial gas turbines and turbochargers, the ﬂuid is collected in one pipe for
delivery to the subsequent modules of the system.
Very little work treated the volute. Figure 9.3 illustrates the volute shape. In
general, the cross-sectional area of the volute must increase with the azimuth angle
to accommodate the increasing ﬂow. The cross-sectional area of the volute may be
very close to the circular shape. However, other shapes for the volute are shown in
the ﬁgure. The simplest method of volute design assumes that the angular momen-
tum of the ﬂow remains constant (rCu ¼ K). The area at any azimuth angle Aθ at any
angle θ is expressed as
Aθ
r ¼ Q θ
2πK
ð9:32Þ
where r and Q are the radius of the centroid of the cross section of the volute and
volume ﬂow, respectively.

In this section, the characteristic behavior of a centrifugal compressor operating
between inlet station 1 and outlet station 2 will be discussed. Changing the
nomenclature a little, the overall stagnation pressure ratio will be P02/P01. For
any compressor, the stagnation pressure at outlet and the overall compressor
efﬁciency are dependent on other physical properties as follows:

The compressor performance is deﬁned (either experimentally or numerically) and
plotted in what is called a compressor map. This map has the vertical axis as the
pressure ratio, or the compressor efﬁciency, and the mass ﬂow parameter as the
horizontal axis for varying rotational speed parameter. If the performance of a
compressor is to be deﬁned experimentally, then the test rig provides capabilities
for both speed and air mass ﬂow rate. For each rotational speed, the air mass ﬂow is
varied and the corresponding pressure ratio and efﬁciency are determined. Next, the
rotational speed is changed and another set of experiments is followed by changing the
mass ﬂow rate and so on. A schematic representation of the compressor map is shown
in Fig. 9.12.

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

Each speed line (or corrected speed) has two limiting points, namely, surge and
choke points. The choking point is the extreme right point on the curve. It represents
the maximum delivery obtainable at a certain mass ﬂow rate, beyond which no
further mass ﬂow rate can be obtained and choking is said to occur. The left point on
the constant speed curve represents surging. Surging is associated with a drop in
delivery pressure with violent aerodynamic pulsation, which is propagated into the
whole machine [6]. Surging may be described as follows. If the operating point is
on the part of the speed line having a positive slope, then a decrease in the mass ﬂow
will be accompanied by a drop in the delivery pressure. If the pressure downstream
the compressor does not fall quickly enough, the air will tend to reverse and ﬂow

9.2

back in the direction of the resulting pressure gradient. This leads to a rapid drop in
the pressure ratio. Meanwhile, the pressure downstream the compressor has also
fallen, so that the compressor will be able to pick up again and repeat the cycle of
events that occurs at high frequency.
9.2.13
Surge
The phenomenon of surge is an unstable condition resulting in ﬂow reversals and
pressure ﬂuctuations in the system connected to compressor. This condition occurs
when there is sufﬁcient aerodynamic instability within the compressor that the
Fig. 9.14 Compressor map referred to sea level conditions
746
9
Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

compressor is unable to produce adequate pressure to deliver continuous ﬂow to the
downstream modules. Normally, surge is associated with excessive vibrations and
an audible sound [10]. Usually, operation in or near surge is accompanied by
pulsating noise level increase, pressure ﬂuctuations, and lateral vibration amplitude
increase and may damage the whole compressor. This instability causes stalling of a
stage or stages of the compressor. The stalling can occur at the inducer of the
impeller, in the radial portion of the impeller, in the diffuser, or in the volute. If
stalling is of sufﬁcient strength, the stage will become unstable, and this can lead to
surge of compressor. During surge, ﬂow reversal occurs resulting in reverse bend-
ing on nearly all compressor components. The higher the pressure or energy level,
the more damaging the surge forces will be. As ﬂow is reduced at constant speed,
the magnitude of relative velocity decreases proportionally, causing the ﬂow angle
to decrease. Additionally, the incidence angle increases, which can result in ﬂow
separation at the low pressure side of the blade leading edge. This ﬂow separation
frequently starts at one or more blades and continuously shifts around the impeller
blades. This occurs at relatively low speeds just before full surge occurs. At higher
speeds, the compressor generally goes directly from stable operation to ﬂow
separation on all blades and full reverse ﬂow.
Rotating stall can also originate in the diffuser. The point at which a compressor
surges can be controlled somewhat by the designer adjusting the diffuser area to
increase the relative speed and ﬂow angle. Of course, higher velocities result in
higher frictional losses, so a designer must balance between desired surge point and
stage efﬁciency during the design process [11].
Vanes in the diffuser shorten the ﬂow path through the diffuser, reducing
frictional losses and controlling the radial velocity component of the gas. Due to
lower friction, pressure ratio and efﬁciency are enhanced, but the operating range is
reduced.
9.3
Axial Flow Compressor
9.3.1
Introduction
Axial compressors are compressors in which the air ﬂows mainly parallel to the
rotational axis. Axial ﬂow compressors have large mass ﬂow capacity, high reli-
ability, and high efﬁciencies, but have a smaller pressure rise per stage (1.1:1–1.4:1)
than centrifugal compressors (4:1–5:1). However, it is easy to link together several
stages and produce a multistage axial compressor having pressure ratios up to 40:1
in recent compressors. Integrally bladed rotors (known as blisks) permit blade
speeds signiﬁcantly above conventional rotors and hence stage pressure ratios
greater than 1.8 [12]. Axial compressors are widely used in both aero-engines and
industrial gas turbines. Almost all present-day jet engines use axial-ﬂow compres-
sors, the notable exception being those used in helicopters, where the smaller size of
9.3

the centrifugal compressor is useful. The fan in turbofan engines is also an axial
compression module which is treated as an axial compressor having a fewer number
of blades of very large height, wide chord, and large twist. These fans may be a
single or up to three stages in low bypass turbofan engines (mostly in military
applications). Jet engines nowadays use two or three axial compressors (in double-
or triple-spool engines) for higher pressure ratios. Nearly all the turbojet engines are
of the two spool type, which have two compressors identiﬁed as low- and high-
pressure compressors. Two spool turbofan engines have the fan as the low pressure
spool. Sometimes this fan represents the ﬁrst stage of the low pressure compressor.
The fan in this case is followed by a few stages of an axial compressor (identiﬁed as
booster), which represents the ﬁrst module of the engine core. In other turbofans,
the fan by its own represents the low pressure compressor which is followed by the
high pressure compressor. Three spool turbofan engines have the fan, intermediate
pressure, and high pressure compressors. The low pressure compressor turns at the
lowest rpm while the high pressure compressor turns at the highest speed.
Since day one of the gas turbine engine, the compressor was the key component
for the success and always required high development efforts and costs. The
importance of the compressors for modern high bypass ratio engines is demon-
strated by the fact that 50–60 % of the engine length and up to 40–50 % of the
weight, 35–40 % of the manufacturing, and 30 % of the maintenance costs is
covered by the compression system. The advances in compressors allow the aero
engines to operate with core engine thermal efﬁciency in the range of 50 % while
the propulsive efﬁciency approaches 80 % [4].
A typical axial compressor depicted in Fig. 9.15 has a series of rotating rotor
blades followed by a stationary ‘stator’ set of blades that are concentric with the
axis of rotation. The compressor blades/vanes are relatively ﬂat in section. Each
pair of rotors and stators is referred to as a stage. The stator blades are required in
order to ensure reasonable efﬁciency; without them the gas would rotate with the
rotor blades resulting in a large drop in efﬁciency. The axial compressor com-
presses the working ﬂuid (here only air will be treated) by ﬁrst accelerating the air
and then diffusing it to obtain a static pressure increase. The air is accelerated in the
rotor and then diffused in the stator. This is illustrated in Fig. 9.15 where the
absolute velocity (C) increases in the rotor and decreases in the diffuser. For
successive stages, a saw-teeth pattern for the velocity is obtained, while the static
pressure continuously increases in both of the rotor and stator rows of all stages.
If the compressor is a part of turbofan engine, it is preceded by a row of inlet
guide vanes (IGVs). Compressor will be ended by a ﬁnal ring of stator blades
(vanes) called the outlet guide vanes (OGVs), as they guide the ﬂow to the axial
direction to suit the compressor outlet. Typically, compressor casing is made of
light weight titanium. However, in recent engines (like Pratt & Whitney 4084
engine), the casing is made of the ‘Thermax’ alloy of Inconel to allow for the
expansion of the casing and keeping acceptable tip clearance margin. The rotor
blades (like the stator ones) have airfoil section like the aircraft wing, but they are
highly twisted from root to tip to obtain the optimum angle-of-attack to the ﬂow
everywhere along the blade length. The reason for that twist is that the root section
748
9
Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

travels much slower than the tip section. Thus for a constant axial velocity, the
relative velocity and angle change from root to tip.
The length of the blades decreases progressively downstream in the same
proportion as the pressure increases. The rotor blades are attached by a dovetail
root, pin ﬁxing, ﬁr tree, and straddle T root [13]. These set of rotor are mounted on
the rotor shaft through drums, individual discs, bolted discs, or clamped. The disks
are assembled with a number of tie-bolts, with the bolt-circle diameter selected to
produce a dynamically stiff rotor and good torque transmission. As the ﬂow usually
has a constant axial velocity through the compressor, the cross sectional area of the
annular passage reduces towards the outlet (or from the front to the rear). This is due
to the decrease of the volume of air (thus increasing the density) as compression
progresses from stage to stage.

Three different layouts are possible; Fig. 9.16. The ﬁrst maintains a constant
casing diameter and increasing the hub diameter of successive stages (9.16a). This
design provides the maximum Mach number and pressure ratio. In the second
pattern, the hub radius is kept constant and the casing diameter is increased,
which provides the best geometry of a compressor (9.16b). The third pattern has
a constant mean diameter, where the casing diameter is decreased and the hub
diameter is increased (9.16c). This typical layout is generally employed in deriving
the basic theory of axial compressors.
9.3.2
Comparison Between Axial and Centrifugal
Compressors
The centrifugal compressor achieves part of the compression process by causing the
ﬂuid to move outward in the centrifugal force ﬁeld produced by the rotation of the
impeller. Thus the pressure rises due to the change in potential energy of the ﬂuid in
the centrifugal force ﬁeld of the rotor. On the contrary, the pressure rise in axial
ﬂow compressor rotors and stators is achieved by the exchange of kinetic energy
with thermal energy in a diffusion process. The pressure rise in a centrifugal
compressor is therefore less limited by the problems of boundary layer growth
and separation in adverse pressure gradients. For this reason, the centrifugal
compressor ﬁrst attained a range of pressure ratio and efﬁciency useful for turbojet
engines and was used in the von Ohain engine (1939) and Whittle engine (1941).
The essential feature of air ﬂow in the impeller of a centrifugal compressor is
that all the ﬂuid leaves the rotor at a constant radius rather than over a range of radii
as in the axial compressor.
9.3.2.1
Advantages of the Axial-Flow Compressor Over the Centrifugal
Compressor
1. Smaller frontal area for a given mass rata of ﬂow (may be 1/2 or 1/3), thus the
aerodynamic drag or nacelle housing the engine is smaller as shown in Fig. 9.17.
2. Much greater mass ﬂow rates as seen in present day axial compressors for high
bypass ratio turbofan engines [14]. In these cases mass ﬂow rates may reach
a

1000 kg/s, while centrifugal compressors have mass ﬂow rates less than
100 kg/s.
3. Flow direction at discharge is more suitable for mitigating, thus suitable for large
engines.
4. May use cascade experiment research in developing compressor.
5. Somewhat higher efﬁciency at high pressure ratio (perhaps 4–5 % higher than
centrifugal compressor)
6. Higher maximum pressure ratio, which was about 17:1 in the 1960s and pres-
ently exceeded 50:1 and even reached 52 for the combined three compressors in
RR Trent 1000 turbofan engines [14].
9.3.2.2
Advantages of Centrifugal-Flow Compressor Over the Axial-
Flow Compressor
1. Higher stage pressure ratio (5:1 or even 10:1), while the maximum value for
research axial stage is only 2.4:1
2. Simplicity and ruggedness of construction
3. Shorter length for the same overall pressure ratio
4. Generally, less severe stall characteristics
5. Less drop in performance with the adherence of dust to blades
6. Cheaper to manufacture for equal pressure ratio
7. Flow direction of discharge air is convenient for the installation of an intercooler
and/or heat exchanger in gas turbines

Main Points for Comparison Between Centrifugal and Axial
Compressors
Table 9.7 lists the main points for comparison between axial and centrifugal
compressors.
9.3.3
Mean Flow (Two-Dimensional Approach)
The ﬂow is considered occurring in the tangential plane at the mean blade height
where the peripheral rotation velocity is U; Fig. 9.19. This two-dimensional
approach means that the ﬂow velocity will have two velocity components one
axial denoted by subscript (a) and one peripheral denoted by subscript (u). The
radial velocity component is neglected here. The mean section for both of the axial
compressor and axial turbine as shown in Fig. 9.19 illustrates that the hub-to-tip
ratio of axial compressor is much smaller than its value in axial turbine.
For a constant mean radius, the velocity triangles at the inlet and outlet of a
single stage are shown in Fig. 9.20. Subscript (1) denotes state of air upstream of the
rotor, while symbol (2) denotes conditions downstream of rotor and upstream of

stator. State (3) denotes conditions downstream of the stator of one stage and
upstream of the rotor of next stage.
The air approaching the rotor with an absolute velocity (C1) at an angle (α1) to
the axial direction when combined to the rotational speed (U) gives the relative
velocity (W1) at an angle (β1) to the axial, refer to Fig. 9.20. After passing through

the diverging passages formed between the rotor blades which do work on the air,
its absolute velocity (C2) will increase (C2 > C1), while its relative velocity W2
decreases (W2 < W1) and the ﬂow exit angle β2 will be less than the ﬂow inlet angle
β1, (β1 < β1). This turning of ﬂow towards the axial direction is necessary to
increase the effective ﬂow area.
Since the relative velocity is decreased due to diffusion (W2 < W1), then the
static pressure increases (P2 > P1), i.e., a pressure rise will be developed in the
rotor.
The absolute velocity of the ﬂow leaving the rotor is C2. The ﬂow then passes
through the stator passages which are also diverging, thus the absolute velocity is
decreased due to diffusion and the static pressure is increased, i.e. C3 < C2 and
P3 > P2. The ﬂow angle at the outlet of the stator will be equal to the inlet angle to
the rotor in most design cases, i.e.α3 ¼ α1

The separate velocity triangles are superimposed either on the common base,

implying that the density is varying inversely with area. Figure 9.21b illustrates the
case of variable inlet and outlet axial speeds.

9.3.3.2
Variation of Enthalpy Velocity, and Pressure an Axial
Compressor
The gain in energy of the air/gas in a compressor stage inﬂuences the different air
parameters as described hereafter. The total enthalpy (and also the total tempera-
ture) increases in the rotor and remains constant in the stator. The total pressure
increases in the rotor and slightly decreases in the stator due to friction. Static
pressure (and static temperature) increase in both of the rotor and stator. The
absolute velocity increases in the rotor and then decreases in the stator. For
successive stages, the absolute speed has a saw shape as illustrated in Fig. 9.15.
The energy equation (or the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics) is expressed in terms
of the inlet and outlet conditions of a stage, states (1) and (3) respectively as
q13 þ h01 ¼ w13 þ h03
Since an adiabatic process is assumed (q13 ¼ 0), then the change in total enthalpy
will be equal to the work done on the rotor, or

Figure 9.22 illustrates the Mollier chart (temperature–entropy) variation for the
compression process through the stage. If the whole processes were isentropic, the
ﬁnal stagnation pressure for the same work input would be P0max. However, due to
losses in the rotor and stator, the pressure at the outlet of the rotor is less than the
maximum value and the pressure for air leaving the stator is also less than the
pressure at the outlet of the rotor, or P03 < P02 < P0max.

direction from one stage to another.
Analysis of experimental results showed that it is necessary to multiply the
changes in swirl velocity (ΔCu) by a factor less than unity identiﬁed as the work
done factor (λ). The axial velocity is peaky as the ﬂow proceeds, setting down to a
ﬁxed proﬁle at about fourth stage, as shown in Fig. 9.23. The value of the work done
factor starts by 0.98 for the ﬁrst stage and decreases to 0.93 and 0.88 for the second
and third stages, respectively. For the fourth and subsequent stages, its value is
constant and equals 0.83.

It is highly desirable to achieve high work input per compressor stage in order to
minimize the total number of stages necessary to provide the desired overall
compression ratio.
Example 9.5 Air at 1 bar and 15 C enters a three stage axial compressor with a
velocity of 120 m/s. There are no inlet guide vanes, and ﬂow enters axially to all
stages and has a constant axial velocity throughout. In each stage, the rotor turning
angle is 25. The annular ﬂow passages are shaped so that the mean blade radius

However, the increase in the rotational speed is limited by the maximum
acceptable tensile stress at the rotor hub. Furthermore, the increase in the rotational
and axial velocities; (U and Ca) is limited by the tip Mach number. Compressors of
the 1960s had a maximum tip Mach number less than 0.8 which has nearly been
doubled for the present transonic compressors; 1.4–1.7 [15]. The ﬂuid deﬂection
has upper limits determined by the diffusion factor or de Haller parameters. Stage
efﬁciency has several loss limitations.
9.3.4.1
Centrifugal Stress
Centrifugal stress depends on the rotational speed (ω), blade material density (ρb),
and height of blade. The maximum centrifugal stress occurs in the root. As shown in
Fig. 9.25, the centrifugal force arising from any element of blade is evaluated as:
dFc ¼ ω2rδm
Fig. 9.25 Nomenclature for centrifugal stress on a rotor blade
764

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

where (ω) and (r) are the rotational speed and the radius of any blade element
having a mass of (δm) and length of (dr).
δm ¼ ρbAdr
Then the maximum centrifugal stress at the root is the summation of the
centrifugal forces of all the elements of the blade from the hub to the tip divided
by the blade cross sectional area at the root, or

The same equations are applied for both fans and compressors. For fans, the blade
height is long which develops large tip rotational speed and the hub-to-tip ratio is
small, thus high tensile stresses are expected at blade root.
9.3.4.2
Tip Mach Number
For different compressor layouts (Fig. 9.16), the maximum Mach number in the
axial compressor occurs at the blade tip of the rotor inlet of the ﬁrst stage. This is
due to the maximum value of relative speed (W1) and the minimum static temper-
ature and so sonic speed at inlet. For the ﬁrst stage, the axial velocity is equal to the
inlet absolute velocity and has a constant value along the annulus. The
corresponding maximum Mach number is

Thus from Eq. (9.52), for a speciﬁed tip Mach number and rotational speed, the
axial velocity at inlet can be determined.
For a transonic compressor, an acceptable value for the maximum Mach number
at the tip is M1tip ﬃ1:3, while for the fan in turbofan engines much higher Mach

number is expected and allowed, thus M1tip ¼ 1:5  1:7. A challenging design is to
increase the rotational speed U and keep the Mach number within the acceptable
limits. This is achieved by adding inlet guide vanes (an additional row of stator
vanes) upstream of the ﬁrst stage of the compressor as shown in Fig. 9.26 to add a
swirl component to the inlet speed (C1) and thus reduces the relative speed (W1).
Note that the passages of the inlet guide vanes are nozzles to increase the absolute
speed (C1 > C0) and thus keeps a constant axial velocity Ca

Fluid Deﬂection
By ﬂuid deﬂection, it is meant the difference between the outlet and inlet angles;
(β2  β1) for the rotor and (α3  α2) for a stator. Excessive deﬂection which means a
high rate of diffusion will lead to blade stall. To maximize the speciﬁc work, the
difference between the ﬂow angles in the rotor must attain its maximum allowable
value. If the inlet relative velocity maintains a constant angle (β1), then the outlet
relative angle (β2) will control stall or install conditions. Since a constant axial

velocity is assumed, then the relative angle is a measure of the magnitude of the
relative velocities (W1, W2). Thus a criterion known as the diffusion factor (DF)
developed by NACA is adopted [15]. Another and earlier method for assessing the
diffusion was the de Haller number, deﬁned as, V2/V1. The limit for installed
operation is (V2=V1 < 0:72). Because of its simplicity, it is still used until now in
preliminary design. However, for ﬁnal design calculations, the diffusion factor (DF)
is preferred. The velocity distribution over the suction and pressure sides of a
typical passage of cascade is shown in Fig. 9.27. The velocities V1, V2, Vmax are
respectively the velocities at the inlet and outlet of the cascade as well as the
maximum velocity over the suction surface. The diffusion factor (DF) is deﬁned as:

Design Parameters
The following three design parameters are frequently used in the parametric study
of a repeating axial stage:
1. Flow coefﬁcient ϕ
2. Stage loading Ψ
3. Degree of reaction Λ
The ﬂow coefﬁcient is deﬁned as the ratio between the axial and the rotational
speeds, or,
ϕ ¼ Ca

The stage loading is deﬁned as the ratio between the total enthalpy rise per stage to
the square of the rotational speed, or
ψ ¼ Δh0

The degree of reaction of a compressor stage has several deﬁnitions. For an
incompressible ﬂow, the degree of reaction is deﬁned as the ratio of the static
pressure rise in the rotor to the static pressure rise in the stage [17], or

The expression given in Eq. (9.57) will be only employed in this book.
The following general relation will be derived for the degree of reaction assum-

velocities at the inlet and outlet of the stage are assumed equal, i.e., C1 ¼ C3, then

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

Now consider the case of 50 % reaction. In this case, the stage provides the best
efﬁciency. If the degree of reaction is much different from 50 %, one of the blade
rows must tolerate greater pressure rise than the other. Now, from Eq. (9.58d),
∴tan α1 ¼ tan β2
∴α1 ¼ β2
Moreover, from Eq. (9.38c)
U
Ca
¼ tan α1 þ tan β1 ¼ tan α2 þ tan β2
∴α2 ¼ β1
This means that these velocity triangles are symmetrical. It is interesting to notice
that if the degree of reaction is greater than 50 %, then β2 > α1 and the velocity
triangles will be skewed in the direction of the rotational speed [19]. The static
enthalpy rise across the rotor exceeds that of the stator (this is also true for the static
pressure). If the degree of reaction is less than 50 %, then β2 < α1 and the velocity
triangles will be skewed in the opposite direction of the rotational speed. The stator
enthalpy rise (and pressure) exceeds that in the rotor.
The case of zero degree of reaction is known as impulse blading. From
Eq. (9.58e), the magnitude of the relative angles at inlet and outlet of the rotor
are equal but have opposite signs β2 ¼ β1. There is no contribution for the rotor
row here. All the enthalpy (or pressure) rises in the stator blade row. The rotor just
redirects the incoming ﬂow, such that the outlet angle is equal in magnitude to the
inlet angle with opposite sign.
The case of 100 % degree of reaction necessitates that α2 ¼ α1. All the
enthalpy (and static pressure) rises in the rotor while the stator has no contribution.
The three cases described above are illustrated in Fig. 9.28.

Real Flow in Axial Compressor
In reality, air/gas ﬂow in turbomachinery (compressor/turbine) is a 3D turbulent
ﬂow [20]. Some of the 3D effects are due to compressibility, radial variation of
density, pressure, and work input/output as well as radial variation in blade thick-
ness, twist, and geometry. Secondary ﬂow and tip leakage as well as boundary
layers over blades, hub, and casing complicate such 3D pattern particularly if
coupled to shock waves. Non-uniform inlet ﬂow due to upstream blade rows
together with air bleed assures 3D of ﬂow. Finally, presence of two-phase ﬂow
like injection of water, rain, ice, sand, and volcanic ash also reﬂects 3D issues.
Since the equations of motion governing such complicated turbulent ﬂow
through complex geometry turbomachinery are highly nonlinear, hence most of
9.3
Axial Flow Compressor
773

the analytical solutions available are for simple ﬂows. These solutions involve
several assumptions depending on the type of machinery and the geometry of the
blade-row and ﬂow parameters. Numerical solutions for the governing equations
started in the late sixties [21]. The 3D ﬂow in turbomachines is either solved by
techniques classiﬁed as either axisymmetric solutions or non-axisymmetric
solutions.
The axisymmetric solution is used to predict radial or spanwise variation of
properties of ﬂow far upstream and downstream of blade rows.
Neither non-axisymmetric nor axisymmetric solutions are appropriate to the
present book. However, what is discussed in previous sections was only a 2D

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

ﬂow, where radial (i.e. spanwise) velocities did not exist. It was assumed that the
radial variations in the ﬂow parameters through the compressors annulus are
negligible. For a compressor in which the blade height is small relative to the
mean diameter, i.e., those with high hub/tip ratios (of the order of 0.8 or more), this
assumption is reasonable. But for blades with low hub-to-tip ratio (say 0.4, as in the
case of the fan of a turbofan engine), radial variations are important. A step further
in describing ﬂow ﬁeld within blade passage will be discussed in the following
sections that may be identiﬁed as quasi-3D ﬂow analysis. Alternatively, it is called
a simpliﬁed radial equilibrium equation (SRE)
9.3.7
Simpliﬁed Radial Equilibrium Equation (SRE)
It is assumed that all the radial motion of the particle takes place within the blade
row passages, while in the axial spacing (gab) between the successive blade rows
(rotor/stator combination), radial equilibrium is assumed. Thus the axisymmetrical
stream surface in the spacing between the blade rows has now a cylindrical stream
surface shape. Thus, the radial component of velocity is neglected in the spaces
between blade rows as
Cr  Ca,
Cr  Cu,
thus
Cr  0
For steady ﬂow, when the continuity and three-momentum equations are solved
over these cylindrical surfaces, they are simpliﬁed considerably, and the resulting
radial momentum equation is called the simpliﬁed radial equilibrium equation
(SRE). Only the radial equilibrium equation is relevant because the ﬂow does not
vary in either the tangential and axial direction. Thus for a steady inviscid ﬂow in
the cylindrical surface and absence of any body force, the variables, Cu, Ca, h and
h0, are function of the radius (r). Therefore, the radial component of the angular
momentum equation is given by Eq. (9.59) identiﬁed as the radial equilibrium
equation:

Equation (9.60) is denoted as the vortex energy equation which is also applicable
(as the radial equilibrium equation) only in the axial space between a pair of blade
rows. Equation (9.60) is an ordinary differential equation and can be easily solved
when all the variables except one are known. For example, for isentropic ﬂow, if Cu
and h0 are known or prescribed, then Eq. (9.60) can be solved for Ca

Thus the whirl velocity component of the ﬂow varies inversely with radius, which is

radial direction, then the radial equilibrium equation, 1

resulting blading is denoted free vortex blading. Though it represents a simple
mathematical treatment for blade twist, but it has two main disadvantages; namely

span (or height).

A great variation in the degree of reaction from the blade hub to tip is depicted by
Eq. (9.62). Moreover, some suspect that at the blade root where its radius is a
minimum, a negative reaction is possible. One note is remaining here is that the free
vortex relation; Eq. (9.61) is applied twice at stations 1 and 2. The following
example illustrates the above points.
Example 9.7 Consider a free vortex design for a compressor stage having a degree
of reaction at the mean section equals to 0.5, hub-to-tip ratio of 0.6, and the ﬂow
angles α1m ¼ 30, β1m ¼ 60. Calculate the absolute and relative angles at the hub
(αh, βh) and tip (αt, βt) for both stations 1 (upstream of the rotor) and 2 (downstream
of the rotor). Calculate also the degree of reaction at both hub and tip.
Solution
Since the degree of reaction is 50 % at the mean section, then α1m ¼ β2m and
α2m ¼ β1m

The difference in the angles (β1  β2) at different stations along the blade span
represents the blade twist. Thus adopting free vortex design yields a highly twisted
blade, which implies high structural loading, and a great variation in the degree of
reaction from hub to tip, which represent a less safe design blading. The velocity
triangles and the blade twist are shown in Fig. 9.29.

General Design Procedure
The disadvantages of the free vortex method mentioned above motivate searching
for other design methods. Thus the design is based on arbitrarily chosen radial
distribution of any two variables of the three (h0, Ca, Cu), then the variation of the
other is determined from Eq. (9.60). However, it is always preferred to employ a
constant speciﬁc work at all radii along the blade together with an arbitrary whirl
velocity distribute for Cu1, Cu2 that is compatible with the constant speciﬁc work
condition. Next, the variation of the axial velocity Ca and the degree of reaction Λ
9.3

with the radius r are calculated. Equation (9.60) is to be solved twice at both stations
(1) and (2) to obtain the radial variation of the axial velocities Ca1, Ca2.
The designer usually prescribes the whirl velocity somewhere between a forced-
vortex and a free vortex design according to the relation:
Cu1 ¼ aRn  b

Cu2 ¼ aRn þ b

ð9:63Þ
where
R ¼ r

The value (a) is determined from the degree of reaction
Λ ¼ 1  Cu1 þ Cu2

At the mean section, the degree of reaction will be

The values of (a) and (b) are constants and independent from the radius (r) as
veriﬁed by Eqs. (9.64) and (9.65).

The total enthalpy upstream of the stage (h01) is assumed constant and indepen-
dent from the radius (r). Since the speciﬁc work, Ws
h02  h01, is assumed
constant, then the downstream enthalpy (h02) is also constant. Now Eq. (9.60) is
to be solved both at state (1) and (2). In both cases the L.H.S. of Eq. (9.60) is zero.
The equation to be solved is now reduced to

The above equation will be integrated at both stations (1) and (2) from the mean
radius to any station (r). Note that at the mean radius
Rm ¼ 1,
Cu1m ¼ a  b
and
Cu2m ¼ a þ b
The resulting values for the axial velocities at any radius in stations (1) and (2) are
calculated. These results are assembled in Table 9.9 together with the values of the
whirl speeds and the degree of reaction.
As stated in [20], for exponential method, the loading as well as the blade twists
is moderate. The new blade design trend is towards low-aspect ratio blading. The
velocity triangles for any type of blading except n ¼ 1 is plotted in Fig. 9.30. At
hub (Ca2 > Ca1), while at tip (Ca1 > Ca2).

Conceptual Design Procedure for Axial Compressor
Compressors are designed by the indirect method [22]. That is, ﬁrst one deﬁnes the
ﬂow path (casing and hub) radii and decides the thermodynamic, aerodynamic
properties as well as work input that air must have at each axial location (station)
along the ﬂow path. An iterative analysis is conducted in which the continuity,
momentum, energy, and state equations are satisﬁed at each station. Then one
designs the blade and vanes to achieve the desired thermodynamic and aerody-
namic properties. The designer is constrained to achieve the overall pressure ratio
and mass ﬂow rate. The full design details are given in [23, 24].
Steps for such a conceptual design of an axial compressor will brieﬂy described
here.
(A) Quasi-3D analysis of compressor
(B) Experimental testing of blades
794

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

(C) Off-design performance analysis
The ﬁrst step (quasi-3D) starts by a 2D analysis (axial-tangential) and then
extended to deﬁne ﬂow properties at different stations along blade height (radial),
thus provides a quasi-3D ﬂow ﬁeld. Details of such step are as follows:
1. Choice of the compressor’s data: rotational speed (rpm) and axial velocity as
well as annulus dimensions based on previous experiences. These data are used
to determine the inlet and outlet dimensions of the compressor
2. Determine number of stages (assuming efﬁciency)
3. Calculate air angles for each stage at the mean section
4. Determine the variation of air angles from root to tip based on type of blading
(free vortex – exponential – ﬁrst power).
The second step (experimental testing) is decomposed into the steps:
1. Selection of compressor blading using experimentally cascade data
2. Check efﬁciency (previously assumed) using cascade data
3. Investigation of compressibility effects
The ﬁnal step is to estimate off-design performance and rig testing prior
production.
9.3.8.1
Choice of Compressor’s Data
(A) Speeds criteria
From past experience of subsonic/transonic compressor design [22], the maxi-
mum tip speed and axial velocity have the following typical values:
Ut  350 m=s
Ca  150  200m=s
(B) Hub-tip ratio
Typical values for the hub-tip ratio of the ﬁrst stage of a compressor are
ζ
rh
rt
 0:4  0:6
Generally hub-tip ratio at inlet ζ > 0:3 and at outlet ζ < 0:9, for fan ζ  0:2
(C) Mach numbers criteria
The following values are suggested:
Axial Mach number Ma  0.5(<0.7)
Relative Mach number: at tip M1tip < 1.2 for the high pressure compressor
(HPC), for fan M1tip < 1.8
9.3
Axial Flow Compressor
795

Relative Mach number: at hub M1hub < 0.9
However, if this compressor is a part of an aero-engine powering a supersonic or
future hypersonic aircraft, the total temperature at the inlet to compressor
approaches or exceeds 1000 K. In this case, the static temperature is very close to
the total values, which leads to very high values for sonic speeds. Thus the Mach
number values suggested above develops unaffordable stresses in the blades.
Consequently, these values are drastically reduced even to half its suggested values.
Alternatively, speciﬁc values for the mean blade and axial speeds are to be
employed.
For the ﬁrst stage, the ﬂow is axial or, C1 ¼ Ca1, then the axial Mach number is
calculated as
C1 ¼ M1

A check is requested here for the hub-tip ratio to be within the speciﬁed range.
Here a decision has to be made concerning the type of variation of the compres-
sor passage at its successive stages. One has to decide whether the compressor will
have a constant mean, constant tip, or constant hub radius through all stages.
Next to determine the outlet dimensions of the compressor, assume the stage
efﬁciency (or the polytropic efﬁciency) of the compressor is ηs, then the outlet

Example 9.13 A preliminary design of the low pressure axial compressor which is
connected to an axial turbine of a small turbojet engine is requested. The compres-
sor has an inlet total temperature and pressure of 322.2 K and 141 kPa. The mass
ﬂow rate is 50 kg/s. The turbine rotational speed is 180 rev/s and has a tip diameter
of 0.285 m. Assume the ﬂow to be axial at the compressor inlet.
Solution
Based on the suggested inlet Mach numbers, assume that the relative tip Mach
number M1tip ¼ 1.1 and the axial Mach number Ma ¼ 0.5. The procedure is as
follows:
1. Calculate the static temperature and pressure and then the density at inlet
2. Calculate the axial, relative, and rotational speeds
3. Calculate the tip radius and from which calculate the hub-tip ratio
4. If the tip diameter is far from the turbine outer diameter, the axial Mach number
is to be changed within its design range
The results for the example is arranged in Table 9.10, where the axial Mach
number varies from 0.5 to 0.6.
Since from turbine calculations
N ¼ 180rps
and
rt
ð Þturbine ¼ 0:285m
Choose M1 ¼ 0.6, where ζ ¼ 0.5 and rt ¼ 0.283 m, which is close to the tip radius of
the turbine. The corresponding blade rotational speed at tip is Ut ¼ 320 m/s
The mean radius is rm ¼ 1þζ
2 rt ¼ 0:213 m. The hub radius is 0.143 m. The mean
rotational speed Um or simply U is 241 m/s.
Example 9.14 A helicopter gas turbine requires an overall compressor pressure
ratio of 12:1. This is to be obtained using two spool layouts consisting of a ﬁve-
stage axial compressor (on the ﬁrst spool) followed by a single stage centrifugal
compressor (on the second spool). The polytropic efﬁciency of both compressors is
0.90. The axial compressor has the following data:

Determine Number of Stages (Assuming Stage Efﬁciency)
To determine the number of stages, the overall temperature rise within the com-
pressor is ﬁrst determined as ΔTcomp ¼ T02  T01. Secondly, the stage temperature
rise is determined. Divide both values to obtain the number of stages. This ﬁgure
will be rounded to the nearest integer.

Calculation of Air Angles for Each Stage at the Mean Section
For a constant mean diameter and known axial and mean blade speeds (Ca, Um), the
angles α1, β1, α2 and β2 will be calculated for each stage. The degree of reaction at
the mean section will be also calculated and checked for reasonable values.
(A) First stage
The ﬁrst stage is characterized by an axial inlet ﬂow (α1 ¼ 0), thus the relative
inlet velocity and angle are calculated from the relations:

tan β1 ¼ Um=Ca
for simplicity Um will be written here as U. The outlet relative angle is to be
calculated from Eq. (9.70), where the rotor de Haller number is selected equal or
greater than 0.72.
The absolute angle at the rotor outlet is calculated from Eq. (9.38) as follows:
tan α2 ¼ U
Ca
 tan β2
which is the inlet angle to the stator, the outlet angle to the stator (α3) may be
calculated from de Haller number of the stator deﬁned as
DHs ¼ C3

The value of de Haller number of stator has to be carefully selected otherwise it may
yield an imaginary value for α3 (if cos α3 > 1.0!!). Thus, it must satisfy the
condition:
DHs > cos α2
ð9:72Þ
Thus
cos α3 ¼ cos α2

9.3.8.4
Variation of Air Angles from Root to tip Based on Type
of Blading (Free Vortex – Exponential – First Power)
The three methods that estimate the variations of air properties in the radial
direction from blade hub to tip are applied here. The procedure is as follows:
1. Calculate the dimensions at the rotor inlet and outlet for each stage.
2. Calculate the values of the constants (a) and (b) from Eqs. (9.64) and (9.65).
3. Use Table 9.9 to calculate the variations in axial and whirl velocities as well as
the degree of reaction.
Now to calculate the dimensions upstream and downstream, the rotor states
(1) and (2); the dimensions at state (3) are ﬁrst calculated from the continuity
equation. The air density is calculated from the perfect gas law, and then the
annulus area is calculated as the axial speed (at mean section is already known).
ρ3 ¼ P3
RT3

A3 ¼

Next, calculate the blade height (h):
h3 ¼

2π rm
If the compressor is designed with constant mean radius, then the root and tip radii
are calculated as
rr3 ¼ rm3  h3
2
rt3 ¼ rm3 þ h3
2
The corresponding hub and tip radii at the rotor outlet are the mean value of those at
states (1) and (3), as shown in Fig. 9.31.
rr2 ¼ rr1 þ rr3
2
rt2 ¼ rt1 þ rt3
2
It remains to calculate the corresponding non dimensional radii (R ¼ r/rm) at the
root and tip at states (1) and (2). After calculating the constants (a) and (b), the whirl
velocities (Cu1 and Cu2) are calculated for any design methods from the known
9.3
Axial Flow Compressor
807

values at the mean radius. Moreover, the axial velocities Ca1 and Ca2 are calculated
for any design method other than the free vortex. The degree of reaction is also
calculated. It is important to have as high degree of reaction at the hub as possible.
9.3.9
Blade Design
Blades design or selection from available airfoil series may be performed through
experimentation or numerical analyses. The objective is to obtain information on
the effect of different blade geometries on air ﬂow angles, pressure losses, and
energy transfer across blade rows. Only experimentation will be reviewed here.
Cascade wind tunnels are used for testing a compressor blade row to be sure that it
satisﬁes the following objectives:
1. To turn air through the required angles

2. To achieve the diffusion process with optimum efﬁciency or in other words

Experiments are generally performed in a straight cascade wind tunnel;
Fig. 9.32, that is composed of a row of geometrically similar blades equally spaced
and parallel to each other. The height and length of cascade in a cascade wind
tunnel are made as large as the available air supply will allow eliminating the
interference effects due to the tunnel walls. Cascade is mounted on a turntable so
that its angular direction with respect to the inﬂow duct (α1) can be set in any

desired value and thus the incidence angle (i) may be varied. Vertical traverses over
two planes usually a distance of one blade chord upstream and downstream of the
cascade are provided pitot tubes and yaw meters to measure the pressure and air
ﬂow angles.
Pressure and velocity measurements are made by the usual L-shaped pitot-static
tubes. Air direction is found by either claw or cylindrical yaw meters.
Important parameters in cascade design and testing are as follows:

deﬂection increases with angle of incidence up to a maximum angle,; εs, known as
the stall or separation point. Since this angle may not be well deﬁned, it is taken as
the angle of incidence where the mean pressure loss is twice the minimum. The
practice has been to select a deﬂection which corresponds to a deﬁnite proportion of
the stalling deﬂection. This proportion found to be most suitable as 80 %, thus the
selected or nominal deﬂection ε* ¼ 0.8εs.
This nominal deﬂection angle (ε*) is mainly dependent on pitch/chord (s/c) ratio
and air outlet angle (α2). Cumulative results of different cascade tests are plotted in
Fig. 9.34. For known ﬂow angles, the deﬂection angle is calculated. Next from this
deﬂection angle and the ﬂow outlet angle, the ratio of (s/c) can be obtained. Since
the blade height is known, then assuming the height/chord ratio is known (typical
present day ratio is h/c ¼ 3 for subsonic compressor), then the blade chord is known
and the spacing (s) is calculated. The number of blades is simply calculated as
n ¼ 2πrm=s
It is recommended to avoid numbers with common multiples for the blades in
successive rows (rotor/stator or stator/rotor) to avoid introducing resonant forcing
frequencies.

The same procedure can be followed for any other blade ratios. The length of the

9.3.10
Choice of Airfoil Type
After the radial distribution of air angles and velocities are determined, the blading
can be designed. First, incidence and deviation angles are selected so that the slope
of the airfoil mean line (camber line) at the leading and trailing edges can be
established [22]. For minimum losses, incidence angle (i) must be in the range
5  i  5. The deviation angle is calculated from Eq. (9.58e), which is also in
the range 5  δ  20. Mean line shape and thickness are selected to achieve the
desired airfoil loadings. The pressure increase is achieved by the diffusion process.
The amount of diffusion is monitored by computing the diffusion factor, Eq. (9.54).
Values of diffusion factor greater than 0.65 mean ﬂow separation is imminent.
The nature and type of blading depends on the application and Mach number
[26]. Subsonic blading usually consists of circular arcs, parabolic arcs, or combi-
nations thereof. Many countries developed their own proﬁles (e.g., United States,
Britain, Japan, West Germany) for subsonic ﬂows. One of the famous American
proﬁles is NACA 65 series blades. The NACA 65 series designation is as follows:
NACA 65 (x) y, or 65-x-y, here x is 10 times the design lift coefﬁcient of an isolated
airfoil and y is the maximum thickness in percent of chord. Moreover, the famous
British proﬁle is the C-series. An example for the C-series is 10C4/20P40, where
blade is 10 % thick C4 proﬁle with a 20 camber angle and a parabolic camber line
812

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

having maximum camber at 40 % of the chord. A 10C4/20C40 blade would be
similar, but with a circular arc. Another British series is the RAF 27 proﬁles. The
NACA 65 series and similar British proﬁles are used in low subsonic ﬂows [23].
9.3.11
Compressor Map
Compressor performance is usually presented in the form of compressor map as
described in the Sect. 9.2.12 for centrifugal compressor. The design point is only a
single point on the compressor map, which is characterized by a certain rotational
speed, mass ﬂow parameter, pressure ratio, and efﬁciency. However, compressor
has to perform efﬁciently in other operating conditions, frequently identiﬁed as off-
design conditions, namely, engine starting, idling, reduced power, maximum
power, acceleration, and deceleration.
Consequently, compressor has to operate satisfactorily over a wide range of
rotational speed (RPM) and inlet conditions. But since the annulus area and
compressor blading are chosen to satisfy the design point condition only, then at
other conditions they will not function correctly [4]. Comparing maps for axial and
centrifugal compressors, it is noticed that for a ﬁxed value of
Nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
T01
p
, the range of mass
ﬂow rate is narrower in axial compressor than that in a centrifugal compressor. At
high rotational speed, the lines become very steep and ultimately may be vertical.
Surge point occurs before the constant speed curves reach a maximum value.
Stage characteristics are similar to overall characteristics but much lower pressure
ratio. Mass ﬂow is limited by choking in various stages.
Since the axial velocity is maintained constant, then the annulus area is inversely
proportional to the air density and thus the annulus area of the compressor decreases
from the front to the rear stages.
9.3.11.1
Stall and Surge
Stall is a situation of abnormal airﬂow through a single or multiple stages of the
compressor. Surge is the situation of stalling of the whole compressor. Surge results
in a loss of engine power. This power failure may only be momentary or may shut
the engine down completely causing a ﬂameout, as shown in Fig. 9.35 for civilian
and military aircrafts. The appropriate response to compressor stalls varies
according the engine type and situation, but usually consists of immediately and
steadily decreasing thrust on the affected engine. The most likely cause of a
compressor stall is a sudden change in the pressure differential between the intake
and combustion chamber. The following factors can induce compressor stall:
Engine over-speed, engine operation outside speciﬁed engineering parameters,
turbulent or disrupted airﬂow to the engine intake and contaminated or damaged
engine components.
9.3
Axial Flow Compressor
813

Rotating stall and surge phenomena in axial ﬂow compressors are the most
serious problem in compressor. Severe performance and reliability problems arise
if the compressor is unable to recover from stall. Surge and rotating stall can be
described as follows [22].
Rotating stall is deﬁned as a breakdown at one or more compressor blades [22]. A
rotating stall is a stagnated region of air which moves in the opposite circumferential
direction of rotor rotation, but at 50–70 % of the blade speed [27]. If the throttle is

814

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

closed or the back pressure is increased, the blade loading or the incidence is
increased. Then the adverse pressure gradient on the suction surfaces increases the
boundary layer growth which leads to separation and stall. Not all the blade passages
will stall at the same time. Stalling of a blade passage will lead to increase of the
incidence angle of the next passage in the opposite direction of rotation.
There may be several stall cells in a blade row rotating in the same time. As
described in [28], part span is usually encountered in the front stages of the
compressor with large aspect ratio blades and low speeds. It is usually encountered
during take-off or start up. Full span stall occurs in the medium speed range and its
effect is much more damaging. In brief, rotating stall does not move axially in either
direction although it may cause pressure waves to move upstream (compression
wave) or downstream (rarefaction waves).
The compressor surge occurs when there is complete breakdown of the ﬂow ﬁeld
in the entire engine (not just blading). Upon surge, a compression component will
unload by permitting the compressed ﬂuid in downstream stages to expand in the
upstream direction forming waves strong enough to lead to ﬂow reversal. The
compressor can recover and begin again to pump ﬂow. However, if surge cause is
not removed, the compressor will surge again and will continue the surge/recovery
cycle until some relief is provided. Otherwise, surge will result in violent oscilla-
tions in pressure, propagation of pressure waves, and the failure of the entire
compression system.
An important parameter called surge margin (very similar to the factor of safety
in mechanical system design) is deﬁned as

When surge occurs in an operating engine, it causes at the least a stoppage of the
airﬂow through the compressor [27], which leads to a straightforward expulsion of air
out the intake. In civil transports, this is evidenced by a loud bang emanating from the
engine as the combustion process “backﬁres”. Passengers will feel successive “can-
non shots” of ﬁre balls spaced about 3/4 a second apart. In particular, the occupants
seated next to the failed engine will be temporarily deaf in one ear and all the other
cabin occupants will complain of ringing ears. Surge also may be accompanied by an
increased exhaust gas temperature and yawing of the aircraft in the direction of the
affected engine. Moreover, all the Mach 0.70+ airﬂow reverse direction from inside
the engine. It projects a ﬁreball from the power generating core combustor of the
engine out the front of the engine (surge phase). However that ﬁre ball is driven back
into the engine by the forward speed of the aircraft and the residual inertia of the
rotating fan (for turbofan engines). The airﬂow tries to re-establish normal direction in
the engine at this point due to the rotating inertia of the engine rotors (recovery phase).
The pilot will think the controls have “whip sawed” him as the forces of the airplane
are redistributed and then he forces them back to where they should be. The cabin will
ﬁll with a haze from the contaminated hot bleed air [4].
9.3
Axial Flow Compressor
815

Violent fan or compressor surge might completely destroy the engine and set it
on ﬁre. But absent such structural damage, the engine will usually recover and
continue to run.
If the engine has been damaged too much (e.g. broken blades and parts), the
airﬂow will not resume a normal path and the engine disintegrates; Fig. 9.36.
If the engine is only partially damaged, it will give 1 or 2 more cannon shots
3/4 seconds apart before the engine completely disintegrates.
In supersonic aircraft, the consequences can be more serious because the block-
age due to surge can generate a shock wave in the inlet which may produce
overpressures large enough to damage the structure.
9.3.11.2
Surge Control Methods
As described above, surge causes serious problems both to compressor, engine, and
aircraft. Though it is unavoidable but its recovery is affordable. Since rotating stall
represents the onset of surge, if stall could be avoided surge will not be seen.
However, this is an impossible task due to the different operating conditions for the
compressors installed in aero engines powering airplanes during any trip or mis-
sion. For compressors in industrial power plants, different conditions are found
during starting, idling, acceleration, deceleration, etc. [4]. Foreign object debris
(FOD) is another serious circumstance that inﬂuences the ﬂuid mass ﬂow rate.
Compressor designers proposed and designed some methods for surge control.
Designers may replace the single spool engine by two spool engine. Each spool
(and consequently compressor) rotates at a different speed. Moreover, they devel-
oped the variable geometry compressor and air bleed system to counteract surge
during engine run. The later techniques are activated by the engine control unit

Centrifugal and Axial Compressors

(ECU), which represents a computerized control system that has its inputs from
sensors within the engine.
(A) Multi-spool compressor
Since reduction in compressor speed from design value will cause an increase of
incidence in the ﬁrst stage and a decrease of incidence in the last stage. The
incidence could be maintained at the design value by decreasing the speed of the
ﬁrst stages and increasing the speed of the last stage; these conﬂicting requirements
can be met by splitting the compressor into two (or more) sections each driven by
separate turbine at different rotational speeds. Examples for the small two spool
engines are General Electric CFE738) and Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600.
Examples for high bypass ratio two spool turbofan engines are General Electric:
CF6, GE90, GEnx, Pratt & Whitney: JT9D and PW4000, IAE V2500, engine
alliance GP7000, CFM international CFM56 turbofan engines. Examples for
three spools are Rolls Royce RB211and Trent family as well as Russian three
spool engines; Lotarev D-36, Lotarev/Progress D-18T and Progress D-436,
Kuznetsov NK-25 and NK-321. Recently, geared fan provides even better surge
control and reduced supersonic losses. Examples for geared fan turbofans are
Honeywell TFE731, ALF 502/507, and the recent Pratt & Whitney PW1000G.
Typical map for the low pressure compressors is illustrated in Fig. 9.37. It may
encounter surge during deceleration. On the contrary, high pressure compressor
may surge during acceleration; Fig. 9.38.
(B) Variable vanes
Variable stator vanes (VSV) may be employed to avoid stalling of stages
susceptible to surge, namely, the front or last stages of compressors. Furthermore,

Axial Flow Compressor

with the tendency of the back end stages to be more lightly loaded (due to lower
Mach numbers), the stall problem is not as severe in the back stages [30]. As a
result, variable stators are normally conﬁned to the front stages and their principle
use is to provide acceptable starting and/or low speed acceleration of the engine.
Positive stall is encountered when the inlet relative angle β1, and consequently the
incidence angle are increased. To reduce this value, two methods are employed. In
the ﬁrst, the inlet guide vanes or the stators of the ﬁrst stages are rotated away from
the axial direction to increase the absolute angle at inlet α1 and thus reduces the
relative inlet angle β1. As an alternative, the rear part of the blade is rotated, thus
becoming over cambered, to do the same job as the completely rotated stators;
Fig. 9.39.
(C) Air bleed
Bleeding of air downstream of a stalled stage or stages will allow the air mass
ﬂow to increase ahead of the bleed location. This increase in airﬂow will in turn
increase the axial speed and thus results in a reduction of the rotor incidence and
install the blade, Fig. 9.40. The ﬂow to the back stages will thereby reduce.
9.4
Centrifugal and Axial Compressors Material
The materials of compressors used in aero engines and gas turbines should have
high strength, ductility, and temperature resistance. In addition, compressors in
aircraft engines must have low density or high strength/weight ratios. Table 9.11

angles provide insight of the compression process within the impeller.

Turbines
10.1
Introduction
Turbines are a class of turbo machinery used to convert the energy in a ﬂowing ﬂuid
into mechanical energy by the use of rotor mechanisms. Turbines, in general,
convert either thermal or kinetic energy of the ﬂuid into work to drive compres-
sors/fans, accessories in turbine-based engines, or drive propellers/helicopter rotors
or electrical generators in shaft-based engines. Gas turbines and steam turbines are
thermal turbo machinery.
There are two basic types of gas turbines, namely, axial and radial ﬂow turbines.
Application areas of interest include propulsion and power systems of all types
and sizes including air breathing engines for both conventional and lift (VTOL)
propulsion, rocket turbo-pump systems and space auxiliary power units driven by
high energy propellants, and inert gas and metal vapor space power systems [1].
Most of the aircraft engines and industrial gas turbines employ the axial ﬂow
turbines. The radial turbine can handle low mass ﬂows more efﬁciently than the
axial ﬂow machines. Axial ﬂow turbine is similar to axial compressor, as both are
composed of several stages. Turbine expansion takes place in “stages” with each
stage composed of a row of stationary blades (nozzles) followed by a row of
moving blades (rotors).
The efﬁciency of a well-designed turbine is higher than that of a compressor.
The main reason is that in compressors, the ﬂuid undergoes a pressure rise and a
ﬂow deceleration accompanied by viscous losses and possible ﬂow separation,
while in turbines the ﬂow is accelerated and thus boundary layer thickness/losses
are minimized and ﬂow separation is avoided.
First stage turbine nozzle sees the hottest temperatures; referred to as TIT
(Turbine Inlet Temperature) or TRIT (Turbine Rotor Inlet Temperature). Modern
engines run TRIT as high as 1200 C (or even higher). Consequently, turbine blades
have to be cooled by cold air driven from compressor through a bleed system.

Turbine stators are subjected to thermal stresses, while rotor blades are subjected to
both mechanical and thermal stresses.

Axial Flow Turbines
10.2.1
Flow Features
The axial ﬂow turbine can be classiﬁed as (1) impulse and (2) reaction. As
described in Chap. 9, in reaction turbines, pressure drop of expansion takes place
in the stator as well as in the rotor-blades. In the impulse turbine, the gases will be
expanded only in the nozzle. Figure 10.1 shows a single stage of a multi-stage axial
ﬂow turbine or a one-stage turbine.
The stage comprises a row of nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) followed by a row of
rotor blades mounted on a disc. Rotor blades may be shrouded or unshrouded. For a
multi-stage turbine, the blading is arranged sequentially in an annulus with the discs
connected via conical drive features forming the drum.
Gases approach the stator (or nozzle) with an absolute velocity (C1), and
normally in an axial direction, thus the absolute angle to the axial direction (α1
¼ 0). The nozzle (either a convergent or convergent divergent) accelerates these hot
gases, thus leave the stator passage at a speed (C2) and angle α2 ; (C2 > C 1).
Moreover, the static pressure and temperature decrease.

Flow next enters the rotor blade row with a relative speed (W2

and relative angle


. Finally gases
leave the rotor with an absolute speed (C3  C1

and angle (α3  α1

: Static
pressure and temperature keeps its reduction through successive stages. The anal-
ysis of a turbine stage is very similar to that of a compressor stage as will be
emphasized here. The relation between absolute, relative, and rotational speeds is
expressed as
~C ¼ ~W þ ~U
ð10:1Þ
The blade speed eU increases from root to tip and hence velocity diagrams will be
different for root, tip, and any other radii points. For short blades, 2-D mean ﬂow
design is valid but for long blades, 3-D approach (which incorporates variations
from hub to tip) must be adopted in design phase. At ﬁrst, we shall consider the
mean diameter of the annulus. Velocity triangles at rotor’s inlet and outlet are
shown in Fig. 10.2. Assembled inlet and outlet velocities triangles are shown in
Fig. 10.3. Gas with an absolute velocity C1 making an angle α1, (measured from the
axial direction) enters the nozzle (or stator) blades and leaves the nozzles or stator
blades with an absolute velocity C2 and angle α2. Flow then enters the rotor blade
row with relative velocity W2 and relative angle β2 and leaves with relative velocity
W3 and relative angle β3: Details of gas ﬂow characteristics through a turbine stage
are summarized in Table 10.1.
Note that the velocity diagram of the turbine differs from that of the compressor,
in that the change in tangential velocity in the rotor;ΔCu, is in the direction opposite
to the blade speed U. The reaction to this change in the tangential momentum of the
ﬂuid is a torque on the rotor in the direction of motion [2]. In a similar way to the
axial compressor, if the axial velocity is constant at inlet and outlet of the stage

Example 10.3 A single stage axial ﬂow turbine has a mean radius of 0.30 m and
blade height of 0.06 m. The hot gasses enter the turbine stage at 1900 kPa and
1200 K, and the absolute velocity leaving the stator (C2) is 600 m/s making 65 with
the axial direction (α2). The rotor inlet and outlet blade angles (β2 and β3) are 25
and 60, respectively. Draw the velocity triangles and calculate:
(i) The rotor rotational speed
(ii) The stage pressure ratio if its efﬁciency is 0.88
(iii) Flow coefﬁcient, loading coefﬁcient, and degree of reaction
(iv) The mass ﬂow rate
(v) The power delivered by the turbine [γ¼ 4/3, R ¼ 290 J/kgK, and ϕ is constant

Since the blade speed U is not constant and varies from root to tip, velocity triangles

Turbine Cooling Techniques
The turbine inlet temperatures of gas turbines have increased considerably over the
past years and will continue to do so. This trend has been made possible by
advancement in materials and technology, and the use of advanced turbine blade
cooling techniques [4]. The ﬁrst stage stator blade is subjected to the highest
temperature and so must withstand the severest thermal stresses while the ﬁrst
rotor must withstand the combined thermal and mechanical stresses. Figure 10.5
shows the trend of ﬁring temperature and blade alloy capability.
Since 1950, turbine stators (nozzles) material temperature capability has
advanced approximately (472 C), approximately (10 C) per year. The importance
of this increase can be appreciated by noting that an increase of (56 C) in turbine
ﬁring temperature can provide a corresponding increase of 8–13 % in output and
2–4 % improvement in simple-cycle efﬁciency. Advances in alloys and processing,
while expensive and time-consuming, provide signiﬁcant incentives through
increased power density and improved efﬁciency. Cooling air is bled from the
compressor and is directed to the stator, the rotor, and other parts of the turbine rotor
and casing to provide adequate cooling. The effect of the coolant on the aerody-
namics depends on the type of cooling involved, the temperature of the coolant
compared to the mainstream temperature, the location and direction of coolant
injection, and the amount of coolant. A number of these factors are being studied
experimentally in annular and two-dimensional cascades.
The concepts underlying the following ﬁve basic air-cooling schemes are

5. Transpiration
Until the late 1960s, convection cooling was the primary means of cooling gas
turbine blades; some ﬁlm cooling was occasionally employed in critical regions.
Film cooling in the 1980s and 1990s was used extensively.
10.2.7.1
Convection Cooling
This form of cooling is achieved by designing the cooling air to ﬂow inside the
turbine blade or vane, and remove heat through the walls. Usually, the air ﬂow is
radial, making multiple internal passes from the hub to the blade tip.

10.2.7.2
Impingement Cooling
In this high-intensity form of convection cooling, the cooling air is blasted on the
inner surface of the airfoil by high-velocity air jets, permitting an increased amount
of heat to be transferred to the cooling air from the metal surface. This cooling
method can be restricted to desired sections of the airfoil to maintain even temper-
atures over the entire surface. For instance, the leading edge of a blade needs to be
cooled more than the mid-chord section or trailing edge.
10.2.7.3
Film Cooling
This type of cooling is achieved by allowing the working air to form an insulating
layer between the hot gas stream and the walls of the blade, which protect turbine
blades from hot gases at very high temperatures.
10.2.7.4
Transpiration Cooling
Cooling by this method requires the coolant ﬂow to pass through the porous wall of
the blade material. The heat transfer is directly between the coolant and the hot gas.
Transpiration cooling covers the entire blade with coolant ﬂow (Fig. 10.7).

and
M1

2. Rotor blade inlet hub relative Mach number
To ensure acceleration relative to the rotor and avoid possible separation at rotor
inlet, then
Mw2
ð
Þhub < 0:7 and α2 ¼ 65  73
3. Stage expansion ratio
For the highest efﬁciency,
•
Expansion ratio per stage should be between 2:1 and 3:1
•
The highest expansion ratio from a single stage turbine is 4.5:1.
4. Flow coefﬁcient ϕ
ð Þ
The ﬂow coefﬁcient versus stage loading for different efﬁciency is plotted in
Fig. 10.8.
5. Hub-tip ratio
To minimize secondary losses and the losses due to tip clearance, the hub-tip
ratio is in the range:
0:5 < ζ < 0:85
6. Aspect ratio (AR)
Aspect ratio based on axial chord
h
Ca
 
should be in the range:
AR ¼ 2:5  3:5
For low pressure turbines (LPT), it may be larger AR ¼ 6
7. Axial gap (g)
To avoid blade vibration difﬁculties, axial gap should be approximately 0.25
times the upstream axial chord.

8. Reaction (Λ)
For best efﬁciency: Λ  0:5
If blade temperature is borderline with respect to creep or oxidation: Λ ¼ 0:3
Hub reaction should be Λ > 0:2
9. Tip speed (Utip)
For high pressure turbine (HPT) due to disc stress limits: Utip  400m=s
For the last stage of an LPT: Utip  350m=s
10. Final stage exit Mach number
To avoid breakdown in ﬂow in turbine’s downstream diffusing duct (exhaust, jet
pipe, or inter-turbine duct), the ﬁnal stage Mach number should be in the range:
Mexit ¼ 0:3  0:55
11. Final stage turbine exit swirl angle
To minimize downstream duct pressure loss, the exit swirl angle should be in the
range:
αexit ¼ 5  20

efﬁciency is plotted (as an alternative to expansion ratio) versus the mass ﬂow
parameter for different rotational speeds.
For each referred speed line, there is a maximum ﬂow capacity which cannot be
exceeded. This operating regime is termed choke. For the map shown in Fig. 10.9,
the choking capacity is the same for all referred speed lines. This is usually the case
when choking occurs in the NGV.

Radial Flow Turbine
10.3.1
Introduction
Radial turbines are similar to centrifugal compressors as both have mixed ﬂow
directions. Fluid enters and leaves in two perpendicular directions. For radial
turbines, the ﬂow enters radially and leaves axially close to the axis of rotation.
This turning of the ﬂow takes place in the rotor passage, which is relatively long and
narrow. For small mass ﬂows, the radial turbine is more efﬁcient than the axial one.
The radial turbine develops a high-pressure ratio per stage than the axial one.
However, multi-staging of axial turbine can also develop necessary high overall
pressure ratios. The radial ﬂow turbines are used in turbochargers for small gas
turbines, turbochargers for cars, buses and trucks, railway locomotives and diesel
power generators, cryogenic and process expanders, APUs in aircrafts and rocket
engine turbopumps [6]. They are very compact and run at very high speeds.
A third type of gas turbines is the mixed ﬂow machine. It is characterized by a
combination of axial and radial motion of the ﬂuid relative to the rotor.
Radial inﬂow turbine is composed of four elements, namely, volute (or scroll),
nozzle vanes, rotor, and a discharge diffuser (sometimes identiﬁed as exducer)
(Fig. 10.10). Flow enters the diffuser at a large radius and leaves it at a smaller
radius.
10.3.2
Aero-Thermodynamics of Radial Inﬂow Turbine
Aerodynamic behavior of gas ﬂow within the turbine passages is demonstrated
by its velocity triangles. Thermodynamic behavior is illustrated by its Mollier chart
or T-s diagram.
10.3.2.1
Velocity Triangles
The velocity triangles for a radial turbine with prewhirl in the inlet volute is shown
in Fig. 10.11, while T-s diagram is plotted in Fig. 10.12.
As no work is done in the nozzle, we have
h01 ¼ h02
ð10:19Þ
The stagnation pressure drops from P01 toP02 due to irreversibilities. The speciﬁc
work is given by Euler’s turbine equation:
W ¼ U2Cu2  U3Cu3
ð10:20aÞ
10.3

The speciﬁc work can be expressed in terms of enthalpy drop as
W ¼ U2Cu2  U3Cu3 ¼ h02  h03 ¼ Cp T01  T03
ð
Þ
ð10:20bÞ
If the ﬂow at the rotor inlet is radial then the relative angle β2 is zero
(thus U2 ¼ Cu2), then
W ¼ U2

ð10:20cÞ
If the whirl velocity is zero at exit (outlet ﬂow is axial), then from Eq. (10.20a):

Spouting Velocity C0
The term spouting velocity C0 (originating from hydraulic turbine practice) is
deﬁned as the velocity that has an associated kinetic energy equal to the isentropic
enthalpy drop from turbine inlet stagnation pressure P01 to the ﬁnal exhaust
pressure. The exhaust pressure here can have several interpretations depending

upon whether total or static conditions are used in the related efﬁciency deﬁnition
and upon whether or not a diffuser is included with the turbine. Thus, if the ﬂow is
assumed ideal isentropic through the turbine with a perfect diffuser, then deﬁne the
speciﬁc work output as
C2

Where C0 is the spouting velocity deﬁned as the velocity equivalent of the
isentropic enthalpy drop, then from Eq. (10.20d):
U2
2 ¼ C2

This velocity ratio is identiﬁed as
ν ¼ U2
C0
¼ 0:707
ð10:22Þ
In practice U2
C0 lies in the range: 0:68 < U2
C0 < 0:71
When no diffuser is used and if total conditions are used instead of static ones,
then the spouting velocity is deﬁned as
C2

2 ¼ h01  h03ss ¼ Cp T01  T03ss

where T03ss is the total temperature when both stator and rotor are isentropic. Also
the speed ratio has the same characteristics identiﬁed by Eq. (10.22).

Introduction
Turbine is coupled either to a compressor or to a fan, thus forming an engine spool.
Each compressor/turbine has a certain design point where the rotational speed (N),
pressure ratio (πc, πt), and mass ﬂow rate ( _m) are speciﬁed. It is requested to operate
efﬁciently over the complete range of speed and power output for aero engine or
power plant. These conditions are identiﬁed as the off-design conditions and resemble
starting, idling, reduced power, maximum power, acceleration, and deceleration.

Single Shaft Gas Turbine Engine
Figure 10.14 illustrates a schematic diagram of a single-shaft gas turbine. The load
could be an electrical generator, a marine screw, a rotor of a helicopter, or a
propeller of a turboprop engine.
The following steps summarize the matching procedure:
1. Select a rotational speed (N); thus, from the known ambient conditions calculate

11. A check is next performed between this gained power and the needed power for
driving the load. If they are unequal, the above procedure is repeated by
assuming another value for compressor’s pressure ratio. Interpolation may be
employed to deﬁne the correct pressure ratio when several iterations did not
provide the exact load requirements.

Off-Design of Free Turbine Engine
In this case, the gas turbine incorporates two turbines, namely, the gas generator
turbine and the free (power) turbine. The power of the gas generator turbine is
exactly equal to that of the compressor. The remaining power in the gases leaving

the ﬁrst gas (generator) turbine is absorbed by the second (free) turbine and used to
drive the load (Fig. 10.16).
The analysis to be followed here is divided into two steps:

(B) Off-design analysis of the free turbine

Chapter 11
Rocket Propulsion
11.1
Introduction
In Chap. 1, propulsion systems were classiﬁed as either air-breathing or non-air-
breathing (rocket) engines. All engines discussed so far belong to the category of
air-breathing engines. In this chapter non-air-breathing engines (or rockets) will be
discussed. Non-air-breathing engines carry oxidizer as well as fuel on board.
A rocket is a propulsive device that produces a thrust force F on a vehicle by
ejecting mass a high relative velocity. Rockets can be classiﬁed into chemical and
nonchemical rockets. Chemical rockets can be further categorized into many types.
The most famous of them are liquid, solid, and hybrid types. Nonchemical rockets
are also classiﬁed into several types including electrical, thermal, solar, and nuclear
rockets. Some ﬂight vehicles use a dual-mode engine, which has an air-breathing
mode (either ramjet, turbojet, or turbofan engine) and a non-air-breathing or rocket
mode. One of the latest applications is SABRE [1].
Schematics of rocket engines are shown in Fig. 11.1. Chemical rockets consist of
a container or containers for propellant, a combustion chamber (frequently identi-
ﬁed as thrust chamber), an exhaust nozzle, an igniter, a navigational equipment, a
payload, etc. Chemical rocket propellants are either solid or liquid. In a liquid
system, the fuel and oxidizer are separately stored and are sprayed under high
pressure (1900–5500 kPa) into the combustion chamber, where burning takes place
that produces gases at high temperature (around 4000 K). Products of combustion
expand through the nozzle to high velocities which in turn generates very high
thrust.
When solid propellants are used, both fuel and oxidizer are contained in the same
casing or combustion chamber. The propellant charge is called the “grain” and it
contains the entire chemical ingredients for complete burning. Once ignited, it
usually burns smoothly at a nearly constant rate on the exposed surface of the
charge. Because there are no feed systems or valves such as there are in liquid units,
solid-propellant rockets are relatively simple in construction.

Thus, the earliest rockets were solid-fuel rockets powered by gunpowder; they
were used in warfare by the Chinese, Indians, Mongols, and Arabs, as early as the
thirteenth century [2].
Rockets have the following advantages over air-breathing engines [3]:
1. Thrust is essentially independent of speed and altitude.
2. Thrust per frontal area is the largest among all known propulsion systems, while
supercharged reciprocating engine is the smallest.
3. Thrust per weight of engine is the largest of all known propulsion systems.
4. No altitude ceiling (or depth ﬂoor).

rocket invention are given in Appendix D. A brief history for important dates is
given hereafter. Archytas, a Greek who lived in Southern Italy, used reaction
principle in ﬂying wooden pigeon (400 B.C.). A second Greek who lived in
Alexandria, Egypt, named Hero (10–67 A.D.), invented his aeolipile machine
which applies the reaction principle of rocketry. In the ﬁrst century A.D., Chinese
put gunpowder (made from saltpeter, sulfur, etc.) in bamboo tubes and tossed them
in ﬁre mostly for ﬁreworks in religious and other festive celebrations. Chinese Feng
Jishen (970 A.D.) is considered the real inventor of rockets. In 1232 Chinese
repelled the Mongol invaders during the battle of Kai-Keng by a barrage of arrows
of ﬂying ﬁre (resemble simple form of a solid-propellant rocket). In 1200s Tatars
and Moors used rockets in their invasion to Europe. In 1650 Kazimierz
Siemienowicz (a Polish artillery expert) published a series of drawings for a staged
rocket. Foundations for modern rocketry were laid by Sir Isaac Newton through his
three laws of motion. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857–1935), a Russian mathemati-
cian, developed the rocket equation and wrote on multistage rockets, artiﬁcial
satellites, and space travel. In 1923 his native Hermann Oberth published a book
on rocket travel into the outer space. The world’s ﬁrst liquid-fueled rocket launched
on March 16, 1926 was created and built by the American Robert Hutchings
Goddard (1882–1945). Goddard and his team launched 34 rockets between 1926
and 1941, achieving altitudes as high as 2.6 km and speeds as high as 885 km/h. He
conducted practical experiments in rocketry. He developed the single and multi-
stage rocket engines for both rocket- and jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) aircraft in
1945. Wernher von Braun assistant of Oberth in 1930 performed early experiments
in testing a liquid-fueled rocket with about 15 pounds of thrust. The V-2 (1942) was
the world’s ﬁrst long-range ballistic missile (Fig. 11.2). It was a liquid-propellant
rocket developed during the Second World War in Germany to attack allied cities.
In 1957 Soviet Union stunned the world by launching an Earth-orbiting artiﬁcial
satellite called Sputnik I. Their succeeding satellite, Sputnik II, carried a dog named
Laika on board. In the same year (1957), Jupiter-C rocket carried the US satellite
Explorer I into the space. April 12, 1961, dates the ﬁrst human’s journey into the
outer space when Russian Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin (Soviet pilot and cosmonaut)
with his Vostok spacecraft completed an orbit of the Earth. Allan Shepard was the
ﬁrst American astronaut to ride to the space inside a Mercury space capsule on top
of a Redstone rocket on May 5, 1961.
Apollo 11 was the space ﬂight launched by a Saturn V rocket (111 meter high)
from Kennedy Space Center on July 20, 1969, and landed the ﬁrst humans on
the Moon, Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong
became the ﬁrst to step onto the lunar surface 6 h later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC.
Since then, both Russia (previously Soviet Union) and the USA competed in
space invasion through many rockets and spacecrafts which were launched for the
Moon and Venus.
Between 1981 and 2011, a total of 135 missions for the space shuttle (Fig. 11.3),
which is a crewed, partially reusable low Earth-orbital spacecraft, was operated by
the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

11.4.1
Thrust Force
The thrust force for an air-breathing engine was derived in Chap. 3 and expressed as
T ¼ _m eue  _m au þ Pe  Pa
ð
ÞAe
Figure 11.5 illustrates the control volume selected in deriving the thrust equation
for both air-breathing and non-air-breathing (rocket) engines.
The following assumptions are followed for analyzing the ﬂow in an ideal
rocket:
Steady ﬂow of gases within rocket engine; thus mass ﬂow rate through the whole
rocket ( _m ¼ constant ). All the species of the working ﬂuid are gaseous. Any
condensed phases (liquid or solid) in the nozzle ﬂow have negligible volume.
There is no heat transfer across the rocket walls; therefore, the ﬂow is adiabatic.
For non-air-breathing engine, no inlet air is ingested into the engine; thus the
inlet momentum term vanishes ( _m au ¼ 0). The thrust equation is reduced to the
relation
T ¼ _m ue þ Pe  Pa
ð
ÞAe
ð11:1aÞ
The thrust force is independent of vehicle speed. It depends on the atmospheric
pressure (Pa) as well as the exhaust parameters: mass ﬂow rate ( _m), speed (ue), and
pressure (Pe).
In the vacuum of space Pa ¼ 0
ð
Þ, the thrust is expressed as
T ¼ _m ue þ PeAe
ð11:1bÞ
For a given design of nozzle, the value of exit pressure Pe
ð
Þ is ﬁxed. Thus, during
ﬂight through the atmosphere, the ambient pressure Pa
ð
Þdecreases continuously. As
a result, the thrust increases with altitude. However, beyond a certain altitude, the
variation is negligible and the thrust is nearly constant as illustrated in Fig. 11.6.
11.4.2
Effective Exhaust Velocity (Veff)
The thrust force can be related to the effective velocity (as described earlier in
Chap. 3).

Comments
In case (1), the nozzle is somewhat too long for sea-level conditions which is
indicated by the fact that Pe
ð
Þis smaller than (Pa). Thus a pressure “undershoot” and
an exhaust velocity “overshoot” occurred. The “penalty” of incorrect nozzle length
simply appears as the negative pressure thrust term. From Eq. (11.1), the difference
in thrust between space and sea level resides in the term AePa
ð
Þ. Since the nozzle
selected was too long at sea level, this thrust increase AePa
ð
Þ during rocket ascent
will be obtained in two steps. First, the negative thrust term Pe  Pa
ð
ÞAe has to be
reduced to zero (case (2)), when the rising vehicle reaches an altitude of 3 km
having equal exit and ambient pressures (Pe ¼ Pa ¼ 70kPa

. This represents an
ideal expansion in nozzle as described in Chaps. 2 and 8. Next, as the vehicle
continues to ascend farther and eventually reaches “empty space” (Pa ¼ 0

(case
(3)), the pressure thrust will attain a positive value equal to PeAe
ð
Þ. The combined
effect of the two phases is simply the elimination of PaAe
ð
Þ provided the nozzle is
ﬁlled at all times.
11.4.3
Exhaust Velocity (ue)
The propellants enter the combustion chamber, mix, and are ignited. The gas
produced is heated by chemical energy released during combustion and expands
through nozzle. Applying the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, the change in enthalpy
of exhaust gases is equal to its kinetic energy. The temperature of gases in
combustion chamber (Tc) will be equal to the total temperature of gases exhausting
the nozzle (Tc ¼ Toe

Important Nozzle Relations
Combustion chamber is frequently identiﬁed in rocket literature as thrust chamber.
Gases leave chamber ﬂows at nearly zero speed and then accelerated in a
convergent–divergent nozzle. It reaches sonic speed at throat and keeps its accel-
erating motion to attain supersonic or even hypersonic speeds at its exit.

Efﬁciencies
Though efﬁciencies are not commonly used in rocket design as in aircrafts, it is
useful to understand energy conversion processes. Similar to air-breathing engines,
rocket engines also have both internal and external efﬁciencies. Internal energy is
normally identiﬁed as thermal efﬁciency, while external efﬁciency is also denoted
as propulsive efﬁciency. The product of both also is identiﬁed as overall efﬁciency.
For chemical rockets, energy stored in fuel is released via a speciﬁc chemical
reaction process. This available energy depends in the combustion efﬁciency.
However, a part of this energy is lost through heat dissipation from combustor.
The remaining energy is now available to the nozzle, but, also, not all of which is
convertible into kinetic energy.
The efﬁciency of converting this chemical energy into kinetic energy is identi-
ﬁed as internal or thermal efﬁciency. This kinetic energy of the exhaust gases is
employed in propelling the rocket. The efﬁciency of converting this kinetic energy
into thrust power is identiﬁed as external or propulsive efﬁciency:

The following striking remarks can be deduced from Fig. 11.9:
(a)
Propulsive efﬁciency can reach 100 % in rockets which is never attained in
air-breathing engines.
(b)
Rockets can operate with exhaust speed less than the ﬂight speed (u=Veff > 1:0

;
on the contrary all air-breathing engines operate with ﬂight speed less than
exhaust speed (u=Veff < 1:0

, as propellant material in rocket is carried within
its interior; thus, it has a zero initial speed, while air-breathing engine has ﬁnite air
speed coming into its core and then next accelerated to a higher value within the
exhaust nozzle.

The Rocket Equation
11.5.1
Single-Stage Rocket
The equation of motion of a rocket is derived here. Newton’s second law of motion
is used. The forces governing the motion of a rocket are thrust (T), drag (D), lift (L),
and gravitational force (mg). Here (m) is the instantaneous rocket mass. First it is
assumed that both thrust and drag are aligned in the ﬂight direction. Flight direction
is inclined an angle (θ) to the vertical direction (Fig. 11.10).
The forces acting on the rocket may be resolved in the ﬂight direction to give
m du
dt ¼ T  D  mg cos θ
ð11:28Þ
The thrust force in the above equation can be either expressed as
T ¼ _m Veff
or
T ¼ _m gIsp
Thus, from Eq. (11.28), m du
dt ¼ _m Veff  D  mg cos θ:
Noting that a large fraction (typically 90 %) of the mass of a rocket is propellant,
thus it is important to consider the change in mass of the vehicle as it accelerates.
Since the rate of mass ﬂow through the nozzle is equal to the negative rate of change
of rocket mass, thus

11.5.2
Multistage Rockets
A multistage (or multistage) rocket is a rocket that uses two or more stages, each of
which contains its own engines and propellant [9]. Thus we have two or more
rockets stacked on top of or attached next to each other. Multistaging is used in
space launch vehicles and long-range ballistic missiles. Two-stage rockets are quite
common. However, rockets with as many as ﬁve separate stages have been suc-
cessfully launched. An example is the Saturn V rocket which used three distinct
stages in order to send its payload of astronauts and equipment toward the Moon.
Rocket staging has two types (Fig. 11.12):
•
Series
•
Parallel
For serial staging (sometimes identiﬁed as tandem or vertical staging), the ﬁrst
stage is at the bottom and is usually the largest; the second stage and subsequent
upper stages are above it, usually decreasing in size. The ﬁrst-stage engines are
every time electronically ignited. As this stage runs out of propellant, the upper
retaining cap splits, sending hot gas onto the next stage, burning it, and throwing the
lower stage back to the Earth. This leaves a smaller rocket, with the second stage on
the bottom, which then ﬁres. It operates at high altitude and thus under very
minimal atmospheric pressure. This process is repeated until the ﬁnal stage’s
motor burns to completion.
Both Saturn V and Explorer I are examples for series staging.
A popular method for producing a large ﬁrst stage has been to cluster several
rockets together to provide greater combined thrust without having to build a larger
rocket. Clustering is the act of using two or more motors in a group (or cluster) and
11.5
The Rocket Equation
937

having them all ignite simultaneously, as opposed to staging, which ignites motors
in succession (one after the other). The Saturn IC is an example of engine clusters
fed from a single set of propellant tanks (Fig. 11.13).
In parallel staging (Fig. 11.12) schemes, solid or liquid rocket boosters are used
to assist with liftoff. These are sometimes referred to as “stage 0.” In the typical
case, the ﬁrst-stage and booster engines ﬁre to propel the entire rocket upwards.
When the boosters run out of fuel, they are detached from the rest of the rocket and
fall away. The ﬁrst stage then burns to completion and falls off. For example, the
Atlas is parallel staged; it has two booster engines that are ﬁred along with the
central sustainer engine at launch.

Advantages of Staging
For a multistage rockets and boosters once the fuel is exhausted, the space and
structure which contained it and the motors themselves are dropped being no longer
useful. Thus the rocket lightens itself. The thrust of next stages is able to provide
more acceleration than if the earlier stage were still attached or a single, large
rocket. Thus, rocket performance is improved by eliminating dead weights.
Each stage can use a different type of rocket motor that is appropriate for its
particular operating conditions. Thus, the lower-stage motors are designed for use
940
11
Rocket Propulsion

at atmospheric pressure, while the upper stages can use motors suited to near-
vacuum conditions. Lower stages tend to require more structure than the upper as
they need to bear their own weight plus that of the stages above them; optimizing
the structure of each stage decreases the weight of the total vehicle and provides
further advantage.
The capability of the rocket to reduce thrust in mid-ﬂight thus avoids severe
acceleration for both men and instruments.
11.5.6
Disadvantages of Staging
Staging requires the vehicle to lift motors which are not yet being used; this means
that the ﬁrst stages must produce higher thrusts than they supposed to do.
Staging also makes the entire rocket more complex and harder to build.
In addition, each staging event is a signiﬁcant point of failure during a launch,
with the possibility of separation failure, ignition failure, and stage collision.
Example 11.6 A three-stage rocket is designed to place a small satellite into the
low Earth orbit, having a payload weight of 200 kg (Fig. 11.14). Data for the rocket
is given in Table 11.5 below. Calculate the increase in its speed Δu

As seen from Table 11.5, most of the weight of the rocket is the weight of the

Second stage:
As the propellant of the ﬁrst stage is burned off during powered ascent, the near-
empty tank and structure of the ﬁrst stage are dropped off to reduce the weight of the
vehicle to achieve orbital velocity. Smaller amount of propellant is retained in the
second- and third-stage tanks.

Chemical Rocket Engines

Introduction
All types of rocket propulsion engines contain a chamber, an igniter, and a nozzle.
Chemical rocket is unique in being a carrier to the whole energy source necessary
for its acceleration.
The chemical reaction of propellant chemicals (usually a fuel and an oxidizer)
takes place in the chamber and produces gases. The energy due to this high-pressure
reaction permits the heating of the product gases to a very high temperature
(2000–3500 C). These hot gases subsequently are expanded in the convergent–
divergent nozzle and accelerated to high velocities (2000–4500 m/s). The nozzle
design, shape, and size are critical for the efﬁcient function of the propulsion
system.
Chemical rockets are either:
•
Solid propellant
•
Liquid propellant
•
Hybrid propellant
11.6.2
Performance Characteristics
The engine’s main components are composed of two elements, namely, a combus-
tion chamber and a CD nozzle. Figure 11.15 illustrates these two modules as well as
the corresponding processes on T-s diagram. Combustion process is assumed a heat
addition process at constant pressure or with certain total pressure drop (ΔPc

in nozzle expansion is assumed an isentropic expansion or an adiabatic process with

certain isentropic efﬁciency. Thus ﬂow in both modules can be described as
follows:

Solid Propellant
11.7.1
Introduction
Solid-propellant rockets are the oldest type of rocket and date back to ancient
China. They are relatively simple in construction as shown in Fig. 11.16. The
term motor is used for solid rocket, while the term engine is used for liquid rocket.
Solid rocket engines are used on air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles and on model
rockets and as boosters for satellite launchers. A simple solid rocket motor consists
of a casing, propellant charge (identiﬁed as grain), igniter, and nozzle. This grain
contains both of the solid fuel and solid oxidizer components combined within a
cylindrical combustion chamber or case. The propellant is casted into the rocket
Fig. 11.15 Rocket engine

shell having a central cavity of different shapes including star shaped that serves as
combustion chamber (Fig. 11.16).
Thrust-burning time proﬁle depends on this cavity. A liner provided between the
case and the propellant protects the case from high temperatures developing inside
the propellant layers.
An electrical signal is sent to the igniter which creates hot gases that ignite the
main propellant grain. Once the ﬂame front is established, combustion is self-
sustaining. The rate of burning is proportional to the exposed surface area. As the
Fig. 11.16 Typical solid-
propellant rocket motor
11.7
Solid Propellant
947

propellant burns, a “ﬂame front” is produced which moves into the propellant until
all the propellant is burned. The hot exhaust gases produced in combustion are used
to propel the rocket.
Solid propellant must have the following features:
1. High chemical energy to generate maximum thrust and speciﬁc impulse
2. High density to enable packing a large quantity of propellant in a small volume
3. Low molecular weight thus the exhaust gases achieve high acceleration
4. Easy to ignite
5. Burns steadily at predictive rate
6. Easy to fabricate
7. Smoke-free and nontoxic
Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are the largest solid-propellant
motors ever ﬂown and ﬁrst designed for reuse. Each measures 12.17-ft diameter
and 149.16-ft length. It generates 3,300,000 lb sea-level thrust. Its weight with
propellant is 1,300,000 lb. Its propellant is ammonium perchlorate/aluminum and
has 11 point star shape in forward motor segments and double truncated cone in aft
segments. Burn time is 75 s and its expansion ratio is 11.3. After burnout at
approximately 150,000 ft, the spent cases separate from the vehicle and arcing up
to approximately 220,000 ft before parachuting to the ocean for recovery and reuse.
Table 11.6 presents advantages and disadvantages of solid rockets.
11.7.2
Composition of a Solid Propellant
There are basically three types of propellant grains, namely:
1. Homogeneous or colloidal propellants
Fuel and oxidizer are contained in the same molecule which decomposes during
combustion. Typical examples are nitroglycerine (NG) and nitrocellulose (NC).
Most propellants are double based (few single-based and triple-based propellants
are found). Double-based propellants are combinations of nitroglycerine (NG) and
nitrocellulose (NC), C3H5 NO2

, with small quantity of addi-
tives. It has nontoxic and smokeless exhausts.

2. Composite or heterogeneous propellants
These are mixtures of oxidizing crystals and a powered fuel (usually aluminum)
held together in a binder (synthetic rubber or plastic). Sometimes light metal
powders are added to increase the energy of the combustion process and fuel
density. They are more stable than homogenous and preferred in long-term stored
rockets. However, addition of light metals makes their exhaust toxic and smoky.
3. Composite modiﬁed double-based propellants
They are a heterogeneous combination of the double-based homogenous (col-
loidal) propellants and composite propellants.
11.7.3
Basic Deﬁnitions
Hereafter, some deﬁnitions are introduced here concerning grain:
1. Cylindrical grain: A grain in which the internal cross section is constant along
the axis regardless of perforation shape.
2. Perforation: The central cavity port or ﬂow passage of a propellant grain; its
cross section may be cylindrical, tubular, rod, star shape, etc. (Fig. 11.17). All
have a circular outer boundary due to rocket casing shape.
3. End-burning (or cigarette-burning) grain is the most common and is used.
4. Neutral burning: Motor burn time during which thrust, pressure, and burning
surface area remain approximately constant, typically within about +15 %
(Fig. 11.18).
5. Progressive burning: Burn time during which thrust, pressure, and burning
surface area increase (Fig. 11.18).
Fig. 11.17 Grains cross sections
11.7
Solid Propellant
949

6. Regressive burning: Burn time during which thrust, pressure, and burning
surface area decrease (Fig. 11.18).
7. Stoichiometric mixture of fuel and oxidizer is the correct proportions for com-
plete combustion. Thus the fuel is identiﬁed as oxygen balanced. If the propel-
lant contains insufﬁcient oxygen for complete burning, it is called under-
oxidized, and if it contains much oxygen, it is called over-oxidized.
Sliver: Unburned propellant remaining (or lost, that is, expelled through the
nozzle) at the time of web.
11.7.4
Burning Rate
Burning rate in a full-scale motor depends on [9]:
1. Propellant composition
2. Combustion chamber pressure
3. Initial temperature of the solid propellant prior to start
4. Combustion gas temperature
5. Velocity of the gas ﬂow parallel to the burning surface
6. Motor motion (acceleration and spin-induced grain stress)
The burning rate r for a solid propellant is:
Burning rate is deﬁned as the recession of the propellant surface in a direction
perpendicular to this burning surface per unit time. At any given initial temperature,
the empirical relationship between pressure and burning rate known as Vielle’s law
may be written as
_r ¼ aPn
c
ð11:42aÞ

n
ð Þ¼ the burning rate pressure exponent or combustion index, which is independent

ignition (Tp). Also it is known as the temperature coefﬁcient which is dimen-

ð11:43Þ
where both of (A) and (T1) are empirical constants.
Thus
_r ¼

T1  Tp

ð11:42bÞ
Here, some features of the exponent (n) [9]:
•
For stable operation, (n) has values greater than 0 and less than 1.0.
•
Most propellants have (n ¼ 0.2–0.6).
•
If n ¼ 0, no change in burning rate over a wide pressure range.
•
When the (n) value is low and comes closer to zero, burning can become
unstable and may even extinguish itself.
•
As (n) approaches 1, burning rate and chamber pressure become very sensitive to
one another, and disastrous rises in chamber pressure can occur in a few
milliseconds.
•
Some propellants display a negative (n) which is important for “restartable”
motors, burning rate, and chamber pressure.
The mass ﬂow rate of gas generation from the motor, refer to Fig. 11.19, is
_m g ¼ ρpAb_r
ð11:44Þ
where:
ρp ¼ solid-propellant density
Ab ¼ area of the burning surface
_r ¼ burn rate or surface regression speed
_m g ¼ rate of gas generation at the propellant surface

Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines (LREs)
11.8.1
Introduction
A liquid-propellant rocket engine (LRE) is a reaction engine using the liquid
propellants (fuel and oxidizer) stored on a ﬂight vehicle board. Since propellant
mass ﬂow rates are extremely large for high-thrust engines, liquids are desirable as
they have high density; thus, the volume of the propellant tanks is relatively low.
After combustion, the liquid rocket propellant (LRP) is converted into gaseous state
and discharges from the engine and creates thrust:
•
High-pressure tanks (one or more)
•
Pumps
•
Turbines
•
Gears
•
Bearings
•
Feeding lines (plumbing or piping)
•
Regulators, valves, and control devices
•
Thrust chamber or thruster (one or more combustion chambers)
•
Nozzle

Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines (LREs)
959

A liquid-propellant rocket propulsion system consists of one or more tanks to
store the propellants, one or more thrust (combustion) chambers, a feed mechanism
to force the propellants from the tanks into the thrust chamber (propellant pumps,
turbines, pressurizing device), power source to furnish the energy for the feed
mechanism, suitable plumbing or piping system to transfer the liquids, a structure
to transmit the thrust force, and control devices to initiate and regulate the propel-
lant ﬂow and thus the thrust and nozzles.
Liquid-propellant rockets can be throttled, be control of mixture ratio, shut
down, and be restarted.
Some commonly used liquid fuels are liquid hydrogen, UDMH, hydrazine,
alcohol, etc.
Some common oxidizers are liquid oxygen, red fuming nitric acid (RFNA),
liquid ﬂuorine, WFNA, etc. Most of the liquid propellants are toxic and require very
high combustion temperature which demands special materials for handling system
and cooling of the walls of chamber and exhaust nozzle. For better mixing and
efﬁcient combustion, the fuel and the oxidizer are atomized into small droplets
through the injectors and then mixed, evaporated, and ignited. Ignition is achieved
by chemical, pyrotechnical, and electrical means. The propellant can often be
hypergolic. The ignited propellants burn under high pressure, sometimes greater
than MPa.
Upon combustion high-temperature gaseous combustion products (CPs) are
formed and discharged through the nozzle. Temperature of CP continuously
decreases, while its velocity increases to sonic speed at the nozzle throat and
supersonic speeds (2700–4500 m/s) at nozzle exit.
11.8.2
Applications
LRE is the main type of engines for booster rockets and space modules. It is widely
used in high-altitude research rockets, long-range ballistic missiles, guided antiair-
craft missiles, and combat missiles. Examples of such LRE are:
•
The three space shuttle main engines (SSMEs), which are sequentially started at
launch, combust a mixture of propellants consisting of hydrogen and oxygen,
which are stored and delivered in a cryogenic liquid state from the external tank
(ET)
•
US Saturn V booster rocket ﬁrst-stage (F-1) engine
•
The Russian “Energy” booster rocket (RD-170) engine

11.8.3
Propellant Feed System of LREs
The propellant feed system of a liquid rocket engine determines how the propellants
are delivered from the tanks to the thrust chamber. The functions of the propellant
feed system in both types are:
1. Raising the pressure of the propellants
2. Feeding the propellant to the thrust chambers
LREs are generally classiﬁed based on the propellant feed system as either
pressure fed or pump fed. Pressure fed is performed using gas pressurization,
while pump fed relies upon pumps [10]. These two systems are shown in Fig. 11.21:
(A) Pressure-fed rocket engines
A high-pressure gas like helium or nitrogen stored in a high-pressure tank at a
very high pressure (say 35 MPa) is used to force the propellants to the thrust
chamber. Pressurization gas is warmed by heat exchanger to avoid its
cooling down.

The advantages of this system are its simplicity, reliability, and avoidance of
turbomachinery. Moreover, procedure for engine cutoff and restart are very simple.
However, its great disadvantage is their large and heavy tanks.
Due to the above advantages, this type of system is typically used for space
propulsion applications and auxiliary propulsion applications requiring low system
pressures and small quantities of propellants. Maneuvering and attitude control
thrusters of satellites and space probes are mostly pressure fed since they are
restarted thousands of times. Other famous applications are all engines of Apollo
CSM and Apollo LM.
(B) Pump-fed rocket engines
The pump-fed system is used for high-pressure, high-performance applications.
Several thousand horsepower engines are needed to drive feeding pumps. The
selection of a particular feed system and its components is governed primarily by
the application of the rocket, duration, number or type of thrust chambers, mission,
and general requirements of simplicity of design, ease of manufacture, low cost,
and minimum inert mass.
The main elements of liquid rockets are:
There are two categories of liquid-propellant rocket engines, namely:
•
Boosting propulsion (hours, days, and months in space)
•
Auxiliary propulsion (10 years or more in space)
11.8.4
Liquid Propellants
Liquid propellants are classiﬁed into two types:
(a)
Monopropellant
(b)
Bipropellant
In rare cases, tri-propellant rockets using three types of propellant are used.
The above classiﬁcation is written as mono-, bi-, and multiphase propellants.
11.8.4.1
Monopropellant
Monopropellant contains an oxidizing agent and combustible matter in a single
substance (Fig. 11.22a). It may be a mixture of several compounds, or it may be a
homogeneous material, such as hydrogen peroxide H2O2; ethylene oxide CH2
ð
Þ2O;
and hydrazine N2H4). Monopropellants are stable at ordinary atmospheric condi-
tions but decompose and yield hot combustion gases when heated or catalyzed.
It has the following features:
1. Monopropellant is passed through a catalyst.
2. Catalyst causes a reaction, which generates heat.
962
11

3. The heated products of this reaction are expelled through a nozzle.
4. Exhaust speed ¼ 2.3 km/s.
5. Usually used for altitude control of spacecraft.
Table 11.8 illustrates the advantages and disadvantages of monopropellant.
Some monopropellants are called hypergolic if the propellants ignite smoothly
on contact with each other. An example is hydrazine.
11.8.4.2
Bipropellant
The bipropellant rocket unit has two separate liquid propellants: an oxidizer and a
fuel (Fig. 11.22b). They are stored separately and are not mixed outside the
combustion chamber [9]. The majority of liquid-propellant rockets have been
manufactured for bipropellant applications. It has the following features:

2. Often use turbopumps.
3. Power tapped off of main combustion.
4. Injectors mix propellant to provide stable and thorough combustion.
5. Heat is generated from combustion.
6. Heated products are expelled out the nozzle.
Table 11.9 lists the advantages and disadvantages of bipropellants.
Also some bipropellants are called cryogenic if it has to be kept at a low
temperature to remain in a liquid state in propellant tanks. Examples are liquid
hydrogen (LH2), liquid oxygen (LOX), liquid methane, and liquid ﬂuorine.
Some bipropellants are also hypergolic like nitrogen tetroxide.
Table 11.10 provides some data for some bipropellant engines and its
applications.

Fundamental Relations
The propellant mixture ratio for a bipropellant is the ratio at which the oxidizer and
fuel are mixed and react to give hot gases. The mixture ratio (r) is deﬁned as the
ratio of the oxidizer mass ﬂow rate rho and the fuel mass ﬂow:
r ¼ _m o
_m f
The total propellant mass

Pump-Fed System
The main element in pump-fed system is the turbopumps. A turbopump is a gas
turbine that comprises basically two main components: a rotodynamic pump that
delivers fuel or oxidizer to the thrust chamber and a driving turbine, usually both
mounted on the same shaft or sometimes geared together. The purpose of a
turbopump is to produce a high-pressure ﬂuid for feeding a combustion chamber
where propellants react and produce high-temperature gases.
The main challenges in the design of turbopumps are to deliver very high power
in a small machine, which implies high pressure (up to 55 MPa), large mass ﬂow
rate (some 2500 kg/s), and small weight turbomachinery.
A turbopump can comprise either a single/multistage centrifugal pump or
multistage axial ﬂow pump. Pumps should rotate at tens of thousands revolutions
per minute. Turbopumps may also include booster pumps.
Pumps are driven by a gas turbine to form together turbopumps. These pumps
raise the pressure of cryogenic ﬂuid to higher than the combustion chamber
pressure. The gas driving the turbine may be a generator in a gas generator by
pre-burning some amount of the propellant, by burning separate propellant (like
hydrogen peroxide in the RD-107/108 engines on the Soyuz), or by gasiﬁcation of
some propellant in the cooling jacket of the thrust chamber and the nozzle.
Advantages of turbopumps:
1. High speciﬁc impulse due to its high pressure in thrust chamber
2. Compact and light weight compared to pressure-fed engines
3. More efﬁcient thus spend less propellant
Disadvantages of turbopumps:
1. Complexity
2. More expensive compared to pressure fed
3. Less reliable compared to pressure fed
4. Turbopumps are used in all stages of launch vehicles. The following Soviet ﬂight
vehicles used turbopumps: Lunar probes E8 (Lunokhods, soil sample missions),
Lunar modules for the man expeditions, space stations Salyut, and Soyuz
manned spacecraft.

Figure 11.23 illustrates three kinds of turbopump systems used for pump-fed
liquid-propellant rocket. Figure 11.23a shows a gas generator cycle. A part of the
fuel and oxidizer is burnt in a separate combustion chamber identiﬁed as pre-
burner. The products of combustion of this small chamber are used to drive the
turbine before exhausted to ambient pressure. For this reason it is identiﬁed as open
cycle [11]. The gas turbine has a high-pressure ratio. To minimize weight, a small
number of stages are employed; thus, a moderate turbine efﬁciency is attained.
Combustion pressure is also moderate, of the order of 5.0 MPa. Examples are the
Japanese LE-5 engine which was used in the second stage of H-1 rocket, Vulcain
2 engine (European ﬁrst-stage rocket engines for the Ariane 5), and many US
engines including Rocketdyne J-2 and the F-1 engines.

Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines (LREs)

Figure 11.23b shows a staged combustion [12] cycle. The turbine exhaust gases
are not dumped but fed into the main combustion chamber. So all propellant and all
heat pass through the thrust chamber and nothing are wasted. The fuel–oxidizer
ratio in main engine need not be the same as in the pre-burner. The turbine pressure
ratio is less than that of the gas generator case. Since the turbine driving gas is not
efﬁciently changed into a thrust like the gas generator cycle, high engine perfor-
mance is not obtained. High chamber pressure is achieved compared with the
previous gas generator, here more than 40 MPa. This system ﬁrst appeared in
USSR. Next, it was employed in the Japanese LE-5A and LE-5B. Moreover, the
space shuttle main engine (SSME) uses staged combustion arrangements, but
separate turbine is used for both fuel (hydrogen) and oxygen turbopumps.
The third type is the “expander” conﬁguration shown in Fig. 11.23c.
Its advantages are making use of all propellant and not requiring a separate gas
turbine.
The gas employed in driving the turbine is produced from the fuel vaporized in
the cooling jacket of the thrust chamber and nozzle. The cycle may be opened or
closed. For open cycle, a small portion of fuel is used to drive the turbine and next is
dumped. In closed cycle (shown in Fig. 11.23c), fuel is redirected into thrust

chamber after leaving the turbine. An example is SNECMA VINCI upper-stage
engine. A comparison between the above three cycles (gas generator, expander, and
staged combustion) is given in [4] and summarized here:
1. The gas generator cycle is the easiest to control and least sensitive since it works
against atmospheric or low pressure. The turbine is a low-ﬂow high-pressure
ratio machine. The discharge pressure of the pump is slightly above chamber
pressure.
2. In the expander cycle, the heat source is the nozzle cooling. All the ﬂow that
passes through the turbine is injected into the chamber. Chamber pressure
depends on how much pumping power can be delivered given the heat input.
This makes it sensitive to the turbine efﬁciency. Turbine discharge pressure is
higher than the chamber pressure.
3. A staged combustion cycle allows for extremely high chamber pressures. As a
consequence the discharge pressure from the pumps has to be extremely high.
Thus multiple pumps are used in some cases.
Table 11.12 gives a summary for reasonable choices of cycle for different
chamber pressures along with the resulting pump discharge pressure as described
in NASA SP-8107 [13].

11.8.7
Rocket Pumps
The principal requirements of a rocket engine pumps are reliability, light weight,
high delivery rate at maximum pressure head, smooth ﬂow for a wide range of
operating conditions, and high efﬁciency. As described in compressor sections, the
used pump types are centrifugal ﬂow, axial ﬂow, and mixed ﬂow pumps which
consist essentially of two basic elements: the rotor and the stator. Centrifugal
pumps are generally designed with a single stage, while axial pumps are primarily
of multistage design. However, multistage centrifugal pumps with crossover-type
volutes have also been considered.
The
selection
of
a
pump
conﬁguration
is
inﬂuenced
by
operational,
hydrodynmic, and mechanical considerations. Pumps have the same working prin-
ciple as compressors, namely, accelerating the ﬂuid ﬂow by imparting kinetic
energy to it in the rotor and then decelerating or “diffusing” it in the stator. This
results in increased ﬂuid pressure head. More details concerning different pumps
are given below:
1. Single-stage centrifugal pumps
Almost all existing chemical and nuclear rockets have centrifugal turbopumps,
due to its simplicity, reliability, wide operating range, and ability to handle large
ﬂows at high pressures efﬁciently. Regarding head and ﬂow rate, centrifugal pumps
can generate more than 100,000 ft and up to 30,000 gpm at 5800 rpm [14].
The elements of a centrifugal pump are rotor and stator assemblies. The rotor
assembly usually includes an inducer, an impeller, and a shaft, while the stator
assembly consists of a casing with stationary diffuser vanes, a volute with discharge
outlet, shaft bearings, and seals. An inducer is an axial ﬂow-type impeller which
increases the static pressure of the entering ﬂuid sufﬁciently.
The succeeding element is the impeller which is basically a rotating wheel. Fluid
is admitted axially into the impeller which may have either forward-leaning, radial,
or backward-leaning geometry the same as in a centrifugal compressor.
2. Multistage centrifugal pumps
For higher-pressure rises, multistage centrifugal pumps can be designed. The
basic construction of a multistage pump is similar to that of a single-stage pump,
except that proper channeling of the ﬂuid between stages is added [15].
3. Multistage axial pumps
Axial types become competitive to centrifugal ones when multistaging and
maximum efﬁciency are of paramount consideration [16]. This design is well suited
to liquid hydrogen service which entails the problems of extremely low ﬂuid
temperature and density. Low ﬂuid density results in high-volume ﬂow and in
high-pressure-head rise requirements. For such applications a multistage axial
ﬂow pump is generally superior with respect to construction and performance.
Elements of an axial ﬂow pump are the rotor and stator assemblies. Rotor assembly
972
11
Rocket Propulsion

which accelerates the ﬂow consists of an inducer, a cylindrical rotor with multiple
rows of rotating blades, and a rotor shaft. The stator assembly which converts the
ﬂuid velocity head into the pressure head includes a cylindrical casing with rows of
stationary blades spaced between inducer and rotating blades, a volute casing,
bearings, and seals [17]. The axial speed of ﬂow is kept constant throughout the
various stages of the pump.
Typical information for turbopumps is given in Table 11.13. It lists many
features of the four turbopumps available in the SSME.
11.8.8
Pump Materials and Fabrication Processes
The ﬁrst set of pumps used in turbopumps was made of aluminum [18]. Next, as the
pressures went up, pumps were made of titanium, steel alloys, and then superalloys
like Inconel or Hastelloy. In the early 2000, a few pump impellers were beginning
to be made by powder metallurgy processes with new material properties. Old
pumps manufactured some 65 years are two to four times as heavy as and consid-
erably larger than a modern newly designed version with better materials.

Axial Turbine
The turbines which provide shaft power to the propellant pumps derive their energy
from the expansion of a high-pressure and high-temperature gas to lower pressures
and temperatures.
As described in turbine sections, turbines are either impulse or reaction turbines.
Impulse turbines can be either single or multistages. Reaction turbines are usually
multistage.
Example 11.13 An axial turbine is used as a power source in a rocket turbopump.
The turbine is a single stage of the impulse type. It has a mean diameter dm ¼ 0:24
m and a rotational speed N ¼ 14, 000rpm: Hot gases ﬂow at the rate of 90 kg/s into
the turbine having a total temperature and pressure of T01 ¼ 960Kand P01 ¼ 7:5
MPa: The turbine pressure ratio and efﬁciency are πt ¼ 1:5 and ηt ¼ 0:85:
Flow in the stator is assumed ideal and ﬂow has an axial absolute exit velocity
from the rotor blade row.
The working ﬂuid is a molecular weightM ¼ 26:5and speciﬁc heat ratioγ ¼ 1:3:

Hybrid Propulsion
11.9.1
Introduction
Hybrid-propellant engines represent an intermediate group between solid- and
liquid-propellant engines. One of the substances is solid, usually the fuel, while
976
11
Rocket Propulsion

the other, usually the oxidizer, is liquid, although reverse hybrids such as liquid
hydrogen burning with solid oxygen have been studied (Fig. 11.25). Such engines
have performance similar to that of solid propellants, but the combustion can be
moderated, stopped, or even restarted. It has better speciﬁc impulse than solid
rocket ones.
The liquid oxidizer is injected onto the solid, whose fuel case also serves as the
combustion chamber. An igniter starts the combustion process, which develops heat
to vaporize the surface layer of solid fuel. The expanding hot fuel gas expands away
from the solid surface and meets the spray of liquid oxidizer. Combustion process
continues in a self-sustaining manner.
Typically the fuel is a polymeric hydrocarbon solid such as HTPB (which stands
for hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene), and the oxidizer can be any of the oxi-
dizers used with liquid-bipropellant engines (hydrogen peroxide H2O2

. HTPB has
slow burning rates; thus, a number of holes, or ports, exposing more surface area of
the fuel for burning are added. Unfortunately, so many holes make the solid fuel
structurally weak and subject to dangerous breakup as the combustion chamber
builds up pressure and gas ﬂow (Fig. 11.26).
Several hybrid propulsion programs were initiated in the late 80s and early 90s.
The Joint Government/Industry Research and Development (JIRAD) program
involved the testing of 11- and 24-inch diameter hybrid motors at the Marshall

Space Flight Center. Another hybrid program initiated during the early 90s was
DARPA’s Hybrid Technology Options Project (HyTOP). The Hybrid Propulsion
Demonstration Program (HPDP) began in March 1995 which included the design
and fabrication of a 250,000-pound thrust test-bed. The most recent advance in
hybrid rockets occurred in the fall of 2004 when SpaceShipOne carried a pilot to
over 328,000 ft in a new era in space tourism.
Some fuel–oxidizer combinations for hybrid-propellant rockets are shown in
Table 11.14.

is the combined oxidizer and fuel mass ﬂux, A is the
cross-sectional area of the combustion chamber, and the exponent (n) has the range
0:6 < n < 0:8.
Assuming that the fuel has a cylindrical area (Ab) with diameter (D

and length (L),
the rate of fuel mass generation is
_m f ¼ ρf Ab_r ¼ ρf πDL_r
ð11:50aÞ
where ρf is the fuel density.
Now following the procedure of Loh [19], who assumed that the recession rate is
proportional to the oxidizer only and not to the combined mass ﬂow of fuel and
oxidizer, then from (c), the fuel regression rate is
_m f ¼ ρf πDLa

Advantages and Disadvantages of Hybrid Engines
The main advantages of hybrid rockets are:
1. Lighter than the corresponding liquid-propellant types due to fewer propellant
pumping equipment and higher fuel density.
2. The regression rate is independent of the chamber pressure which is an important
characteristic in the motor design.
3. Inherently safe due to the nonexplosive character of the fuel. Thus in the event of
a structural failure, oxidizer and fuel cannot mix intimately leading to a cata-
strophic explosion that might endanger personnel or destroy a launch pad.
4. Thrust control is comparatively easier because only the ﬂow of liquid oxidizer
need be regulated.
5. Greater choices in the selection of grain conﬁguration compared to solid-
propellant rockets.
6. Less constituents as it uses only one liquid containment and delivery systems.
7. Less complexity due to omission of a regenerative cooling system for both the
chamber and nozzle.
980

8. A large cost saving could be realized both in manufacture and launch operation
as the fuel could be fabricated at any conventional commercial site.
Additional advantages over the solid rocket are:
(a)
Greatly reduced sensitivity to cracks and de-bonds in the propellant.
(b)
Better speciﬁc impulse.
(c)
The products of combustion are environmentally benign unlike conventional
solids that produce acid-forming gases such as hydrogen chloride.
11.10
Nuclear Rocket Propulsion
Nuclear rockets have never developed or ﬂown due to the grave risk of spreading
radioactive debris if an accident occurred [19] [20].
Nuclear sources include:
•
Radioactive isotope decay
•
Fission reactor
•
Fusion reactor
Nuclear rocket engines may be divided into two general classes based on the
type of reactor used:
(A) Solid-core systems
(B) Fluid-core systems, which may be further subdivided based on its core into:
•
Liquid core
•
Gas core
•
Plasma
Solid-core reactor systems have been under active investigation since 1955
[19]. These engines utilize reactors with graphite, metal, or metal–carbide cores
capable of operating at temperatures ranging from 2000 to 3000 K.
Such solid-core rocket engine is an adaptation of liquid-propellant engine, but
with the combustion chamber replaced by reactor (which resembles a heat
exchanger) and the oxidizer-feeding system eliminated.
It includes a propellant tank, feeding system (may be of the gas generator, staged
combustion, or expander system), reactor, and a convergent–divergent nozzle.
Nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) has the following main advantages:
1. High speciﬁc impulse capability which reduces the in-orbit mass requirements
for staging high ΔV missions
2. High-thrust level which increases interplanetary trip times
3. Ability to utilize any gaseous propellant and thus has the best potential for using
in situ planetary propellant resources

Both of the speciﬁc impulse and thrust are proportional to exhaust speed ue,
which in turn is proportional to chamber temperature Tc and inversely proportional

Equation (11.50b) indicates the desirability of using hydrogen (MH2 ¼ 2) as a
propellant. Its low molecular weight is the source of the superiority of the nuclear
engine over its chemical rival. Table 11.15 demonstrates these facts for some
nuclear propellants.
Due to close similarity between the ﬂuid-core nuclear engine and liquid-
propellant engine, same analyses for feeding systems including turbopumps and
nozzle will not be repeated again here. However, it is worth to say that these
components differ from similar components found in liquid chemical rockets only
in the modiﬁcations required to allow them to survive and function properly in the
reactor radiation environment.
11.11
Electric Rocket Propulsion
11.11.1
Introduction
Electric propulsion is deﬁned as “the acceleration of gases for spacecraft propul-
sion by electric heating and/or by electric and magnetic body forces” [21]. Electric
thrusters typically use much less propellant than chemical rockets because they
have a higher exhaust speed and higher speciﬁc impulse over long periods com-
pared with chemical rockets. Thus, electric propulsion can work better than chem-
ical rockets for deep space missions. However, electric propulsion is not usually
suitable for launches from the Earth’s surface, because of its very small thrust.
Historically, the idea of electric propulsion for spacecraft was introduced by
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1911 [22]. The ﬁrst in-space demonstration of electric
propulsion was an ion engine carried on board the Space Electric Rocket Test-I
(SERT-I) spacecraft, launched on July 20, 1964. Russian satellites have used
electric propulsion for decades, while only recently other countries used electric
propulsion. However, presently it is extensively used. As of 2013, over

200 spacecraft operated around the world use electric propulsion for station keep-
ing, orbit raising, or primary propulsion. In the future, the most advanced electric
thrusters may be able to impart velocity increase Δv of nearly 100 km/s which is
enough to take a spacecraft to the outer planets of the solar system. A useful
overview of electric propulsion for spacecraft was presented in [23].
Electric propulsion thrusters for spacecraft may be grouped in three families
based on the type of force used to accelerate the ions of the plasma, namely:
•
Electrostatic
•
Electrothermal
•
Electromagnetic
11.11.2
Electrostatic Rockets
In electrostatic thrusters, discrete particles are charged by electron bombardment
and then accelerated by electrostatic Coulomb forces. Electrostatic propulsion
depends
on
the
attraction
or
repulsion
of
electrically
charged
particles
(by electron bombardment) and uses this effect to accelerate a stream of positively
charged ions in order to produce thrust [24]. Spacecraft SERT-II (Space Electric
Rocket Test-II) used electrostatic ion propulsion and operated for 10,000 h in space.
Its different types are:
(a)
Ion thrusters (ITs)
(b)
Field emission electric propulsion (FEEP)
(c)
Colloidal thrusters
11.11.3
Electrothermal Rockets
Electrothermal rockets are very similar in principle to chemical and nuclear rocket
as the propellant is a ﬂuid (like hydrazine) which is heated in some chamber prior to
its acceleration in a nozzle to convert its thermal energy to a directed stream that
delivers reactive thrust power to the vehicle.
Heating may be achieved by either:
(a)
An electrical heating through the chamber wall or a heater coil (resistojets)
(b)
An electrical arc through the ﬂuid (arcjets)
(c)
Inductively
and
radiatively
heated
devices,
wherein
some
form
of
electrodeless discharge or high-frequency radiation heats the ﬂow
11.11
Electric Rocket Propulsion
983

11.11.4
Electromagnetic Rockets
Electromagnetic propulsion devices depend on the creation of a magnetic force on a
conducting ﬂuid (gas or plasma), by passing it through a ﬁeld with crossed electric
and magnetic ﬁelds. Its different types are:
(a)
Magneto plasma dynamic (MPD) thrusters
(b)
Hall thrusters (HTs)
(c)
Pulsed plasma thrusters (PPTs)
(d)
Pulsed inductive thrusters (PITs)
A brief comparison between the above three families may be summarized as:
1. Electrostatic thruster generates the highest speciﬁc impulse (from 2000 to over
10,000 s) and efﬁciency (from 60 to >80 %) and the smallest thrust (5 μN  0:5
N

). Example for electrostatic thruster is the Deep Space-1 ion engine [25].
2. Resistojet electrothermal types develop the minimum speciﬁc impulse (<5 00s)
and moderate thrust (0.05–5 N), exhaust velocity ~3.5 km/s, and efﬁciency
~80 %. But the electrothermal arcjet has a speciﬁc impulse (<7 00s), higher
exhaust velocity ~5–6 km/s, and lower efﬁciency ~40 %.
3. Electromagnetic (MHD) type generates the maximum thrust (25–200 N) and a
very high speciﬁc impulse (2000–5000 s) and efﬁciency (30–50 %).
