Everyone loves Scratchjr!
Children
“It’s really cool—I can make whatever I want. I made a project of 
The Very Hungry Caterpillar!” 
—Child, 6 years old, showing off his ScratchJr book report
“I was really excited to show my dad my space project. I was 
really proud of the characters disappearing and showing up 
again.” 
—Second grader
“My favorite block is Repeat Forever. You can take the Move 
Left block and then if you put the red Repeat Forever block at 
the end of it, your car will move left and left and left . . . forever!” 
—Kindergarten student
Teachers
“Students love exploring and discovering new blocks on their 
own, and I encourage the students to share these discoveries 
with their peers. I find that the best experience of the students 
is having them learn together.”
—Kindergarten teacher
“One of our report card skills is ‘child can follow multistep 
directions.’ You can see the kids practicing this when they 
sequence their programs.”
—Kindergarten teacher
“The students love working on ScratchJr, in and out of class. 
I like that they have to think in advance about what they are 
going to do and then test it throughout the process.” 
—First-grade teacher

“Technology is here now and it’s the future, and I think 
the earlier that we can get kids into it, the better off they’ll 
be . . . and it’s fun. We all know that people learn when they’re 
having fun.” 
—Second-grade teacher
Parents
“My daughter always thought that she wasn’t as good with 
technology as her brother, but ScratchJr showed her how much 
she was capable of.” 
—Parent of a second grader and a kindergartner
“For skeptical parents out there, I would tell them to embrace 
technology and go for it with their kids. My daughter and I used 
ScratchJr at home and it was tremendous. We loved it.” 
—Parent of a five-year-old
“I am proud to support ScratchJr. My son is already playing it 
on his own, making the ducks do crazy things (he was inspired 
by one of the sample programs). He’s just having simple fun with 
it now, and I am sure it is the best start for doing something 
deeper later.”
—Parent of a five-year-old
“I’m treating ScratchJr as another language. I think of it as a 
constructive tool instead of a game tool; I think if other parents 
approach it that way, then their kids will get more out of it.” 
—Parent of a second grader

This book’s history stretches back 
50 years when, in the 1960s, Seymour 
Papert presented a bold new vision of 
how computers might enter the lives of 
children. At the time, computers still cost 
tens of thousands of dollars, if not more. 
The first personal computers would not

xiv
become commercially available for another decade. But Seymour 
foresaw that computers would eventually become accessible for 
everyone, even children, and he lay the intellectual foundation for 
how computing could transform the ways children learn and play.
While other researchers imagined that computers might some-
day be used to deliver information to children or pose questions 
to children, Seymour had a very different vision. He believed 
that children should be in control of computers, using them to 
experiment, explore, and express themselves. ­Seymour and his 
colleagues at MIT developed the programming ­language Logo 
specifically for children so that children could program their 
own pictures, stories, and games. In his 1980 book Mindstorms: 
Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas, Seymour argued that 
children should program computers, not the other way around.
The two of us writing this book (Marina and Mitch) worked 
closely with Seymour when we were graduate students at MIT, 
and we were deeply influenced by his ideas. Both of us have ded-
icated our careers to extending Seymour’s work, providing young 
people with opportunities for designing, creating, and inventing 
with new technologies.
Mitch’s Lifelong Kindergarten research group at the MIT 
Media Lab collaborated closely with the LEGO Group on the 
MINDSTORMS and WeDo robotics kits and cofounded the 
­Computer Clubhouse Network of after-school learning centers 
for youth from low-income communities. More recently, the 
group developed the Scratch programming language and online 
community, which is used by millions of young people (ages 8 
and up) around the world.
Marina’s Developmental Technologies (DevTech) Research 
Group at the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study and 
Human Development at Tufts University has focused on early 
childhood learning, developing technologies and activities for 
preschool, kindergarten, and early elementary students. The 

Preface
xv
group developed the ideas and prototypes that led to the KIBO 
robot kit, which enables young children (ages 4–7) to program 
robotic projects by putting together sequences of wooden blocks. 
With KIBO, children learn programming without screens or 
keyboards. In 2013 Marina co-founded KinderLab Robotics to 
make KIBO widely available. The ideas underlying Marina’s 
and the DevTech Research Group’s work are described in 
Marina’s books Blocks to Robots: Learning with Technology in the 
Early Childhood Classroom (Teachers College Press, 2007) and 
Designing Digital Experiences for Positive Youth Development: 
From Playpen to Playground (Oxford University Press, 2012).
In 2010, Marina suggested that our two groups work together 
to develop a programming language for young children, extend-
ing MIT’s work on Scratch and drawing on Tufts’ experience 
with early childhood learning, and thus the idea for ScratchJr 
was born. We teamed up with Paula Bontá and Brian Silver-
man of the Playful Invention Company (PICO), who brought 
strong expertise in the design and development of ­programming 
languages for children (and who also had worked closely with 
­Seymour Papert). ScratchJr has been a true team effort, with 
contributions by many people at Tufts, MIT, PICO, and else-
where. We encourage you to look at the ScratchJr website 
(http://www.scratchjr.org/) for a full list of contributors.
We’ve been thrilled by the response to ScratchJr from thou-
sands of children, parents, and teachers around the world, but 
we recognize that more and better support materials are needed 
to help people use ScratchJr to its full potential. We wrote this 
book to support the use of ScratchJr in both homes and schools. 
We hope that you find the book useful, and we look forward to 
hearing your feedback and suggestions.

Preface
xvi
We want to thank members of the ScratchJr team who 
helped in researching, writing, and producing this book, par­
ticularly Claire Caine, Amanda Strawhacker, Mollie Elkin, 
Dylan Portelance, Amanda Sullivan, and Alex Puganali.
We are also extremely grateful to Tyler Ortman and Serena 
Yang at our publisher, No Starch Press. They have provided 
invaluable help and advice throughout the process of writing 
and publishing the book.
ScratchJr would not have been possible without generous 
financial support from the National Science Foundation (grant 
number DRL-1118664) and the Scratch Foundation. If you enjoy 
this book and ScratchJr, we hope you’ll consider making a dona-
tion to the Scratch Foundation (http://www.scratchfoundation 
.org/) to support the future development of ScratchJr software 
and educational materials.
Enjoy!

In recent years there has been a pro­lif­
eration of educational apps and games, 
full of flashy graphics and engaging 
music, for young children. But many of 
these educational apps have been frus­
trating for parents and teachers. The
An Introduction 
to ScratchJr

An Introd u ctio n to ScratchJr
2
problem: very few educational apps provide young children with 
opportunities to design, create, and express themselves. That’s 
what motivated us to create ScratchJr. 
What Is ScratchJr?
ScratchJr is an introductory programming language that encour­
ages creativity and expression, enabling five- to seven-year-old 
children to create their own interactive projects through coding, 
as it is often called these days. 
Using ScratchJr, children can snap together programming 
blocks to make characters move, jump, dance, and sing. They 
can modify how their characters look, design their own back­
grounds, add their own voices and sounds and even photos of 
themselves—and then use the programming blocks to bring 
their characters to life.
ScratchJr was inspired by the popular Scratch programming 
language, used by millions of young people (ages eight and up) 
around the world. We redesigned the interface and program­
ming language to make it developmentally appropriate, as well 
as fun and engaging, for younger children. 
Based on feedback from children, parents, and teachers, we 
went through dozens of prototypes for ScratchJr to make it as 
effective as possible for its purpose. We hope that you find it a 
useful tool for engaging children. 
Why Did We Create ScratchJr?
We believe that every child should be given the opportunity to 
learn how to code. Coding is often seen as difficult or exclusive, 
but we see it as a new type of literacy—a skill that should be 

An Introd u ctio n to ScratchJr

accessible for everyone. Coding helps learners to organize their 
thinking and express their ideas, just as writing does.
As young children code with ScratchJr, they learn how to 
­create and express themselves with the computer, rather than 
just interact with software created by others. Children learn to 
think sequentially, explore cause and effect, and develop design 
and problem-solving skills. At the same time, they learn to use 
math and language in a meaningful and motivating ­context.
As children use ScratchJr, they aren’t just learning to code, 
they are coding to learn.
Who Is This Book For? 
This book is for anyone who wants to help children learn to code 
and, more broadly, to think creatively and reason ­systematically. 
It was written particularly for people without coding experience 
or technical expertise, but it can also be helpful for those who 
do have expertise but don’t have experience working with young 
children. 
ScratchJr was designed especially for five- to seven-year-olds 
as a precursor to other programming languages. With a little 
additional support, younger children can enjoy it too, and it can 
also be useful for introducing older children to coding before they 
move on to other programming languages (like Scratch).
And, of course, for parents or educators without any coding 
knowledge, this book is a good way to learn the basics of coding. 
The best way to learn something new is to teach it to someone 
else. So as you help young children learn to code, you’ll be learn­
ing too.

What Do You Need? 
You need to have ScratchJr downloaded on a tablet. ScratchJr 
is available free of charge and runs on iOS and Android devices. 
There are links to download ScratchJr at http://www.scratchjr 
.org/. You can download it from the App Store for an iPad, and it 
runs on second-generation or newer iPads. Download it from the 
Google Play Store if you have a 7-inch Android tablet or larger 
that runs Android 4.2 (Kit Kat) or later. 
What’s in This Book? 
This book consists of four chapters. Chapter 1 introduces some 
initial activities to familiarize you with the basic features of 
ScratchJr. The rest of the book assumes you can make your way 
around ScratchJr, so don’t skip the first chapter! The remain­
ing chapters describe projects that young children can create 
with ScratchJr. Chapter 2 shows playful animations, Chapter 3 
shows how to tell interactive stories, and Chapter 4 shows how 
to create fun games. 
Each chapter is made up of a set of short activities that intro­
duce new programming blocks and features and a final project 
to integrate all of this knowledge. Each activity reinforces age-
appropriate math and literacy skills, and includes tips and chal­
lenges for children who want to explore more. 
Finally, the appendices have resources and references to help 
you make the best use of ScratchJr.

How Should You Use This Book?
We developed the projects as a sequence of activities that will 
incrementally teach different aspects of ScratchJr in a devel­
opmentally appropriate way. But don’t feel as though you need 
to follow this book step-by-step. Feel free to mix and match and 
adapt our suggested projects to your own and your child’s inter­
ests. Follow your child’s lead. Every detour is a child-directed 
learning experience. ScratchJr is a tool for self-expression. 
­Children should feel free to explore ScratchJr’s many buttons 
and features and to use characters and backgrounds that are 
meaningful to them. This is something we hear frequently from 
parents and teachers.
And please, do let us know how it’s going! Hearing about all 
the different ways you’ve used this book will help us to improve 
ScratchJr further. Send your comments to info@scratchjr.org.
Have fun! 


Welcome to ScratchJr! The projects that 
you can make with ScratchJr are lim-
ited only by your imagination. If you can 
dream it, you can make it. 
This chapter will teach you the basics 
of using ScratchJr, and together we’ll 
make a dance party! You’ll learn how

to make characters move and speak, how to change the back-
ground, and how to save your work so you can build on it again 
or share it with your friends. You’ll also learn how to delete 
objects and undo steps.
After finishing this chapter, you’ll know your way around 
the ScratchJr interface, and you’ll know how to use the program-
ming blocks to bring your characters to life.
Activity 1: Throw a Dance Party!
Let’s get the ScratchJr cat to dance with a friend on a stage. 
This chapter will show you how to set up and complete your 
first project.

Step 3: Make the Cat Move!
This is where the magic happens! You can make amazing ani-
mations, silly stories, and great games—all from the ScratchJr 
editor. Whatever you make will play in the center of the screen. 
We call this area the stage.

Each new project starts with the ScratchJr cat. To make the 
cat move, we can use the motion blocks, which are in the blue 
palette of programming blocks. Use your finger to drag one of 
the blue arrow blocks to the programming area.
Drag this block 
and then let go.
Motion Blocks
Tap the blue block, and the cat moves in the direction of the 
arrow!
You can drag more blocks to the programming area and snap 
them together to make a ­sequence of actions, which we call a 
script. 
Add some more blue motion blocks to make the cat dance. 
Can you guess what movement each block makes? Experiment 
to see which blocks make the best dance. 
To run the script and see the cat dance, tap any of the blocks 
in the script. Notice that the script runs from the beginning no 
matter which block you tap, and each block is highlighted as 
it runs.
Congratulations! You just made your first computer program! 
Now let’s turn it into a dance party!

Step 4: Use the Green Flag
There are other ways to make your project run besides tapping 
on scripts. You can also use the Start on Green Flag block to 
start your script. 
First, tap the yellow button in the block categories area to 
show the triggering blocks. Select the Start on Green Flag 
block, drag it to the programming area, and snap it onto the 
front of your script.

Now tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. 
The cat will dance just like it did when you tapped on the 
script! 
You can see that there are other triggering blocks. You’ll 
find out how to use these as you go through the other projects 
in this book.

Step 5: Add a Background
Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white 
background. Select a new background by tapping on the button 
with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. 
This is called the Change Background button.
You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For 
our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at 
the top to load it into your stage.

The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely danc-
ing on its own. . . . 
Step 6: Add Another Character
Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of 
your screen to add a character.

Getting Started
15
If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters 
you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and 
then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen 
the penguin.

Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the 
stage is the character area, which shows you all the characters 
involved in your project. 
The new character will always appear in the middle of the 
stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever 
you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a 
spotlight.

Character Area
You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat dis-
appeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the 
script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now 
the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. 
Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see 
the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and 
you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin 
again so that you can give it dance moves of its own. 
Step 7: Don’t Just Dance, Say Something!
Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can 
add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap 
the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the looks 
blocks.

Getting Started

Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s 
dance!” First, tap the word hi to make the keyboard appear. 
Use the backspace key to delete hi, and then type Let’s dance! 
or whatever you want the penguin to say.

Ch apter 1

Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and 
then put a Start on Green Flag block at the beginning of the 
penguin’s script.
Now try it out by tapping the Green Flag button ( 
 ) at 
the top of the screen.
You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start 
running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag ­button, 
it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag 
block for every character, all at the same time. This will be 
­really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters. 
Step 8: Add a Title
You can display a title on the stage by tapping the Add Text 
button ( 
 ) at the top of the screen. In the window that pops 
up, type Dance Party. 
You can drag the title around the screen and place it any-
where you want.
You can also use the Change Size ( 
 ) and Change 
Color ( 
 ) buttons to change the size and color of the title 
you give your project. Play around and see what suits your 
stage best. Press Go to try it out on the stage. If you want to 
edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text 
window back up.

Step 9: Name Your Project
Now give your project a name so that when 
you open ScratchJr again and see your proj-
ects on the home screen, you’ll know which 
project is which. 
To name your project, tap the yellow 
tab in the top-right ­corner of the screen. 
Then delete the current project name 
(­Project 1) and type Dance Party. When 
you’re ready to return to the main screen, 
tap the check mark.

If you want to send your project to someone else who has 
ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details 
on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Ques-
tions on the ScratchJr website (http://www.scratchjr.org/about 
.html#faq). 
You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!
Step 10: Save Your Project
To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the 
Home button ( 
 ) in the top-left corner. Your project will not 
be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea 
to do this a few times while you are working on your project so 
that you don’t lose anything.

Hints
The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing 
right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a char-
acter to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the program-
ming area and tap the block. 
1
The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can 
then delete this block and the character will continue to face left. 
Tips for Grown-ups
ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different 
actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when 
you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have suc-
cessfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” 
If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn 
the volume off on your device. 
Don’t Be Afraid to Explore!
As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel 
free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. 
You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many 
ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the 
background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you 
want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you 
don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid 
of them. 
We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.

Undoing and Redoing
You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo 
button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the 
Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of 
your work, one step at a time. 
Undo
Redo
If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse 
the most recent Undo.
Deleting Objects
To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger 
and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a long press) 
­until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete 
the object. 
You can use this process to delete a character within a proj-
ect or even delete an entire project from the home screen.
Deleting Blocks
To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the program-
ming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. 
You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette 
doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.

A Guided Tour of the ScratchJr Interface
Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a 
look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we 
skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of 
the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay 
to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to. 
Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.
Tapping the Green Flag 
runs all the scripts
that begin with a
Start on Green Flag block.
The Home button exits
to the home screen and
 saves your project.
Presentation Mode expands the
stage to the full screen. This is 
great for showing off your work.
The Grid button allows you to turn
the coordinate grid on and off.
Change Background lets you choose
a new background for the stage.
With Add Text you can add titles 
and labels to your projects.
Reset Characters moves
all the characters back to
their starting positions
on the stage. 
Tapping the Stop button 
stops the scripts that 
are currently running.

What’s Next?
You now have a good working knowledge of the ScratchJr inter-
face. Move on to the next chapter to learn about new program-
ming blocks and to explore new types of projects. 


Let’s get more familiar with ScratchJr by 
creating some simple animations. To get 
your characters moving, you just need to 
give them scripts that describe how you 
want them to move.
We’ll do four small activities together, 
and then we’ll make a final animation at 
the end of the chapter!

Activity 2: Make Your Cat Move!
Can you get the ScratchJr cat to move from one side of the 
screen to the other? Figure out how many Move Right blocks 
you need!
What You’ll Learn
In this activity, you will explore some options for making the cat 
move on the screen. All motion in ScratchJr follows a grid, and 
you’ll discover how to change the number of steps along this grid 
using the motion blocks.
You’ll also learn how to use the Start on Green Flag block to 
reset your cat’s position so that you can run your script again 
and again.

How to Make It
You can make a very simple script with lots of Move Right blocks, 
and the cat will take one step to the right for each block. But 
isn’t it a lot of work to drag and connect all these motion blocks 
together?
There must be a better way to do this. . . .
Aha! There is a number at the bottom of each motion block. 
Let’s see what happens when you change it.
Number
Input
When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, 
a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. 
Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. 
Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.
Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more. 
1.	 Tap the Grid button at the top of the screen to show the grid.

Ch apter 2
30
You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help 
you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.
The blue square
indicates the cat’s 
exact position
on the grid.
Horizontal
position
Vertical
position
2.	 Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat 
moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square 
will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will 
indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.
3.	 Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using 
the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.
4.	 If you start your script with a Start on Green Flag block 
and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the 
top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position 
before the script runs. 

Anim atio ns
31
This will make it easier for you to make changes in your 
script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the 
same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by 
dragging the cat to another location on the stage.
5.	 When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners 
of the stage, save your project by tapping the Home button  
( 
 ). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access 
all of your projects and make new ones.
Hints
There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you 
want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to 
move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and 
vertical steps.
Looking for a Challenge?
If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see 
if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.
Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when 
you change the number input. 
2
Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the 
same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other. 
2

This is because the number input on a Hop block controls 
how high a character will hop, not how many times a character 
will hop.

Literacy Connection: Spelling a Name
Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a 
name for the cat! Tap the Paintbrush button to go to the paint 
editor, and replace the word Cat at the top with your cat’s name. 
Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it. 
Math Connection: 
Seeing How Many Ways You Can Get to 10
See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will 
end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts 
can you create that will make the cat move to that particular 
location?
Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and 
get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the 
motion blocks to see what happens. 
Tips for Grown-ups
Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block 
can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting 
up these two scripts to show how they make a character move 
the same distance.

Activity 3: Make Your Cat Turn!
Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counter-

What You’ll Learn
In this activity, you’ll create another 
new project and learn how to use the 
Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt 
your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. 
See how many times your cat has to turn 
right or left to make a full circle. Then try 
thinking of other ways you could use these 
blocks!

2.	 Drag the Turn Right block from the blue blocks ­palette to 
the programming area.

3.	 Change the number input, and tap the Turn Right block to 
see how the cat responds. 
Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat 
turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should 
be to make the cat turn a full circle.
4.	 Don’t forget to start your script with a Start on Green Flag 
block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before 
turning.
5.	 Now try the same thing with the Turn Left block!
Hints
Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your 
finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t 
rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion 
block to do that. 
Looking for a Challenge?
See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it 
turn and move forward at the same time. 
Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the 
same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use 
this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat 
move diagonally!

Literacy Connection: Describing Feelings
Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? 
Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they 
understand why your cat is feeling that way.
Math Connection: Telling Time
Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare 
that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which 
one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat 
in the same direction as a clock’s hands?
See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the 
way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat 
turn halfway around the circle?
Tips for Grown-ups
You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms 
of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-
twelfth of the full circle.

Activity 4: Let’s Play Hide-and-Seek!
The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The 
cat will disappear and then reappear three times. 
What You’ll Learn
In Chapter 1, you used a purple block to 
make a character say something. In this 
activity, you will learn how to use the 
­purple Hide and Show blocks to make 
the cat disappear and reappear.
How to Make It
1.	 First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. 
These control how a character looks.
2.	 Drag the Hide and Show blocks to the programming area, 
but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the Hide block to see 
what happens. Now tap the Show block. These blocks make a 
character disappear and reappear.
Hide
Show

Ch apter 2
38
3.	 Now drag two more sets of Hide and Show blocks to the 
programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make 
a script that causes the cat to dis­appear and then reappear 
three times.
4.	 Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.
Hints
If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, 
you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!
Looking for a Challenge?
Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another 
place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then 
reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? 
How about three times?
Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, 
to see how they change your cat’s appearance.

How large can you make the cat? How small can you make 
it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on 
these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. 
See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the 
cat’s size.

Literacy Connection: Telling a Story
Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about 
why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this 
story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain 
what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!
Math Connection: Observing and Counting
Count the number of times your cat disappears and how 
many times it reappears. Does this match the number of 
blocks you used?
Tips for Grown-ups
It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when 
you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes 
children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their 
character complete a script after it has disappeared. 
Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a charac-
ter’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.

Ch apter 2

Activity 5: Do Something Over and Over!
In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on 
the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.
What You’ll Learn
Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use 
several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on 
a block. 
In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and 
the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.
Repeat
Repeat
Forever
4
How to Make It
Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:
The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) 
make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and 
Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than 
use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the 
first pattern run several times. 

Anim atio ns
41
1.	 First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them 
back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide 
block and a single Show block.
2.	 Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the control 
blocks.
Control Blocks
3.	 Drag the Repeat block to the programming area and position 
it around the two purple looks blocks.
You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat 
block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do 
exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change 
this number to 3.
You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and 
reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disap-
pear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat 
block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever 

Ch apter 2
42
block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign 
button that replaces the green flag button while a script is 
running.)
Hints
You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at 
the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks 
from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on 
the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the 
blocks to the right of that block will move with it.
Looking for a Challenge?
Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try 
out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the 
animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not 
included in the Repeat block.
You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends 
with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat 
forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat 
block will repeat for the number of times specified by the num-
ber input.

Literacy Connection:  
Comparing Your Scripts to Sentences
As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in 
your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of 
the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks 
light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script 
in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks 
take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take 
longer to say.
Tips for Grown-Ups
Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by 
looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script 
is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color 
when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker 
shade of purple, which means it is currently running.
The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and 
you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each 
block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the 
main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.
www.allitebooks.com

44
Math Connection: Comparing Two Scripts
Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another 
script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat 
block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the 
same thing.
Tips for Grown-ups
When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see 
a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the program-
ming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly 
which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.
You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat 
block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around 
all the blocks you want.

Project Time! Old MacDonald’s Farm
For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a 
barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when 
you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you 
learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.
How to Make It
Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.
1.	 To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the 
animals a good place to graze. Tap the Change Background 
button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the 
farm onto the stage.
2.	 Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start 
with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to 
add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap 
the check mark.

Ch apter 2
46
3.	 We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then 
move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag 
button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, 
and snap them together to make this script:
4.	 Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add 
more animals to your scene and create programs for them so 
that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button? 
Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give 
them programs to make the animals move around the stage. 
You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop 
block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Per-
haps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move 
Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.
Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add differ-
ent animals if you want to!
If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:

5.	 You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat 
from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, 
tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing 
and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.
6.	 You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of 
the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it 
to your farm too.
Hints
Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and 
each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green 
Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag 
button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start 
on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character 
will move.

Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks 
like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button,

Literacy Connection:  
Building New Vocabulary
Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that 
live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old 
MacDonald project? 
Remember, you can add text to your project, create charac-
ters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!
Math Connection:  
Counting the Blocks You’ve Used
Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue 
(motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you 
use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you 
used. Which block color did you use the most?
Tips for Grown-ups
If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag 
button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for 
all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block. 
Sometimes children may get frustrated because their charac-
ter is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an 
important part of the programming process is debugging—that 
is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and 
then improving the program.

You can make your own stories with 
ScratchJr by adding dialogue and new 
scenes to your animations. Invent new 
characters who talk to each other and 
travel to new places, just like in a story­
book. With ScratchJr, you can make 
these ­stories come to life and play out 
before your eyes like a movie!

to record another sound.
Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only 
after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to 
five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll 
learn how to add multiple pages in “Activity 7: Turn the Page!” 
on page 58.)

Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in 
the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a 
Start on Green Flag block, but don’t connect them together! 
Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound 
blocks.  

Making Connections
57
Literacy Connection: Presenting
Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to 
complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly 
when you record sounds so that other people can understand the 
story you have created. 
You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. 
Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. 
When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts 
with a friend or two and answer their questions. 
Math Connection: Adding and Subtracting
Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it 
dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance 
moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move 
right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number 
of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop 
blocks, how many dance moves are there now? 
Tips for Grown-ups
Make sure that your device allows recording through a micro­
phone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.
Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, 
it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you 
answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone 
now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of 
apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.
Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded 
sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and 
project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make

Activity 7: Turn the Page!
Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in 
your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will 
see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in 
your story, like turning pages in a book. 
You can show a character traveling through your school by 
making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that 
your character will visit.
What You’ll Learn
In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple 
pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages 
and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll 
learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your 
story from beginning to end without stopping.
How to Make It
In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: 
a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.

1.	 Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a char­
acter to tell the story. 
2.	 Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat char­
acter on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat. 
3.	 Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we 
will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the 
Green Flag button. 
4.	 When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on 
the right side of the screen.
Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of 
your story!

It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you 
can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on 
the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page. 
5.	 Pick a background for page 2. This time, let’s choose the gym.

6.	 We want the same character from page 1 to be on this page, so 
add the girl as you did before and delete the cat. 
7.	 In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump 
up and down a few times. 
8.	 Now add a third page with a background that looks like another 
room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, 
delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character 
should take. 

Ch apter 3
62
In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto 
it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”
9.	 When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them 
so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first 
page in the list to go back to it. 
10.	Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the end blocks. 
Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with 
a small picture of your new page (called a thumbnail) in it. 
End Blocks
You have a 
Go to Page block
for every page
in your project.

11.	Use the Go to Page 2 block at the end of your character’s 
script on the first page. 
When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to 
the second page of your story. 
12.	Now tap the second page, and add the Go to Page 3 block to 
the end of the script there. 
13.	Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the 
Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the action will 
flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new 
page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green 
Flag block will run automatically. 
Hints
As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of 
them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, 
and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character 
or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then 
tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the 
pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.
You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to 
­another by dragging the character from the character area to the 
page thumbnail.

Telling Your Own Stories
Use ScratchJr to tell a story that actually happened to you! Use 
multiple pages to make sure your story has a beginning, middle, 
and end. Try including more pictures and words to tell your story. 
Don’t forget to share it with a friend when you’re all done! 
Math Connection: Sequencing Your Story
Make new pages and put them in order. Practice counting for­
ward each time your story moves to the next page. How many 
pages does your story have? Are your pages in the correct order? 
Tips for Grown-ups
If the action does not automatically continue after the script has 
turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on 
Green Flag block.
To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first 
page is currently selected when you tap the Green Flag ­button. 
If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag 
­button, the action will start on that page and continue to the 
end, without going through the first part of your story.

Activity 8: Change the Pace!
Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!
What You’ll Learn
In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set 
Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.
How to Make It
1.	 For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background. 
2.	 Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.
3.	 Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a 
Start on Green Flag block. 
4.	 Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. 
You can use the Set Speed block to make characters go slowly 
or quickly.

Set Speed

Ch apter 3

When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set 
Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, 
and Fast. 
This changes the speed of any action block you put in the 
script after the Set Speed block. 
Your characters will all move at medium speed unless 
you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or 
quicker.
5.	 In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . . 
. . . and the monkey to go faster.
6.	 Tap the Green Flag button at the top and watch them race! 
Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you 
make it a tie?

Stori es

Hints
Since the scripts for the zebra 
and the monkey are so similar, 
we can take a shortcut. After 
making the zebra’s script, copy 
it to the monkey by dragging it 
from the zebra’s programming 
area over to the monkey in the 
character area on the left side 
of the stage.
Now choose the monkey 
and just change the speed in 
the Set Speed block in the 
script that you copied.

Looking for a Challenge? 
Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your char­
acters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a 
character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a char­
acter disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly? 
You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can 
you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? 
Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combina­
tions to see how your character can move.
Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action 
blocks that come after it.

Literacy Connection:  
Creating Announcements
Use the Add Text button at the top of the stage to create an 
announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, 
add a second page to your story and type an announcement 
about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page. 
Hint: go back to “Activity 7: Turn the Page!” on page 58 if 
you need a reminder of how to move from page 1 to page 2. 
Math Connection: Timing the Race
Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to 
complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. 
Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal 
had the fastest time? 
Tips for Grown-ups
It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and 
Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”
When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, 
you should see the script return to the programming area of 
the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s 
possible that you did not actually reach the target character 
before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that 
case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this 
happens, just tap the Undo button on the blocks palette, and 
the script should reappear.

72
Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, 
the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new 
speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, 
the character will move down at normal speed and then move up 
quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the charac­
ter will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set 
to Fast. 
To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of 
the script to reset the character to its initial speed.

Activity 9: Stop and Look!
Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the 
­sidewalk! 
What You’ll Learn
In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make 
the action pause for a few seconds.
How to Make It
1.	 Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top 
of the grass next to the house. 
2.	 Start your script with a Start on Green Flag block, and 
then use the Move Down block to have the cat take two steps 
toward the sidewalk.
Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps 
are too many, have the cat take one step instead.

4.	 You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait 
block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. 
The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the 
number to 20 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before cross­
ing the street.
5.	 After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, 
so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side 
of the street.
6.	 When you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at 
the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the 
Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This 
makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, 
pause, and then cross the street.

Literacy Connection: Adding Narration
What does your cat want to say during different parts of the 
story? Use the Say block to add narration. Can’t think of what 
to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke! 
Math Connection: Changing the Wait Time
Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your 
cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you 
enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds? 
Tips for Grown-ups
The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a 
­second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will 
wait 5 ­seconds. You can help your child understand this by 
counting seconds out loud.

Activity 10: Wait Your Turn!
You can use the Wait block to control how two characters inter­
act with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the 
cat a ride and they gallop off together!
What You’ll Learn
The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough 
to let another character say or do something.
How to Make It
1.	 First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. 
You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the 
horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown 
here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they 
move together.
2.	 Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a Say block to have 
the cat say, “May I have a ride?”
3.	 Add a Wait block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (20 tenths of 
a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it. 

Ch apter 3
78
4.	 Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.
5.	 Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a Wait block 
set to 2 seconds (20 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to 
ask for a ride. Then, add a Say block to have the horse reply, 
“Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.
6.	 Now when you tap the Green Flag button at the top, the cat 
and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat 
a ride to the end of the field! 

Stori es

Hints
Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move 
together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the 
cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat 
is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.
Looking for a Challenge?
After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer 
“Thanks!” You will have to add another Wait block for the horse 
so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try 
to figure out how much time you need to add for this. 
Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and 
says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?

Literacy Connection: Using Full Sentences
Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters 
speak to each other. 
Math Connection: Counting the Wait Time
If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how 
much time you need and replace the number on the block with 
your new time. 
Tips for Grown-ups
Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. 
It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes 
to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the num­
bers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more 
precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message 
and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in 
Chapter 4.
One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse 
is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The 
last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in 
the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation 
will look a little nicer.

Activity 11: Build a Snowman!
ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to 
draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you 
can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!
What You’ll Learn
In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint 
editor to make your own characters! You can also 
change other characters and backgrounds using the 
paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, 
it means you can edit that object or create your own 
object.

How to Make It
1.	 Start your project by choosing the arctic background. 
2.	 To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the 
screen as if you were going to add a new character.
3.	 Without actually selecting a character, tap the Paintbrush 
button to open the paint editor.

4.	 Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of differ­
ent sizes. To make a circle, tap the Circle tool.

5.	 Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or canvas) in a 
diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get 
the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift 
your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s 
middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you 
can move it.

If you tap on the drawing 
instead of dragging it, little

We want our snowman to have 
round snowballs, so be careful 
not to drag one of these little 
circles, or you might acciden­
tally change the round shape.

8.	 Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller 
circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap 
the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye

makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the Duplicate tool 
(which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you 
want to copy.

carrot. Use the Drag tool to drag the carrot into place on 
the snowman’s face.
Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t for­
get that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at 
the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such 
as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the 
top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will 
appear in your arctic scene.

Ch apter 3

Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell 
your winter story!
Hints
If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the 
paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead 
of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing charac­
ters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as 
a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go 
ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or 
modified characters that you make will be saved in your charac­
ter menu so you can use them in all of your projects.
If you make a mistake with your character, you can use 
the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in 
particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of 
scissors).

Literacy Connection: Asking Questions
As you are using the paint editor, you may need extra help 
finding the tool that you want. Don’t be afraid to ask your 
­classmates or an adult!
Math Connection: Counting the Circles
Count the circles as you add them to the snowman to make sure 
that the three circles of the body plus the two circles of the eyes 
make five circles. 
Tips for Grown-ups
When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, chil­
dren might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled 
circle and an unfilled one. Try selecting a more visible color just 
to show them how the Fill tool works. Then go back to white and 
fill the circles for the snowman.
Appendix B has a quick reference guide for all the tools in 
the paint editor.

Project Time! The Tortoise and the Hare
Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make 
a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tor­
toise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have 
to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the 
Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise 
and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned 
about making characters talk to each other and about turning 
story pages.
How to Make It
1.	 Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the ­rabbit 
character. 
2.	 We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use 
the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise 
quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene 
than it does in the paint editor.

Ch apter 3
92
3.	 The race will go over the farm, past a river, 
and through an orchard. For this we need 
to make two new pages. Add the river back­
ground to the second page and then add the 
spring background to the third page.
4.	 Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the 
two new pages too. Drag the rabbit char­
acter from page 1 to page 2 to copy it over, 
and then drag the tortoise from page 1 to 
page 2. Don’t forget to copy the characters 
to page 3 too.

5.	 You can use the Add Text button to add words of different 
sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a 
title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story 
that you can read aloud. Select page 1 and tap the Add Text 
button to give your story a title.
6.	 Now comes the action. On page 1, the tortoise and the hare 
talk about the race they want to have.

Ch apter 3
94
7.	 We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can 
you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?
“On your mark, get set, GO!”
Here are some tricks you may need:
• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets 
to the end of the page first! You can use the Set Speed 
block (set to Fast) and the Hide block to make the hare 
run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick 
to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! 
Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want 
it to slow down once it reappears.
• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!
• Fables like “The Tortoise and the Hare” usually have a 
moral at the end—a sentence explaining what the charac­
ters learned. You can use the Add Text button to display a 
moral at the end of your story. Use the Change Size but­
ton to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.

Stori es
95
Hints
Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up 
the timing of Wait blocks.
When you have more than one character, you need to add 
the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to 
turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the 
Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, 
and the page may turn before all the characters have finished 
their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script 
that takes the longest to finish. 
Looking for a Challenge?
Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple Play 
Recorded Sound blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds 
with the actions on the screen?

Literacy Connection: Creating a Digital Book
When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of draw­
ing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the 
tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the 
Say block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the Add 
Text button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your 
digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly 
to describe what is happening as your scripts are running. 
Math Connection: Making Characters Move
Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the 
characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need 
to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to 
make your characters move the way you want. Can you make 
the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the 
numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on 
the stage, try tapping the Grid button (at the top of the screen), 
and use the numbers on the grid as your guide! 
Tips for Grown-ups
It will likely take children many tries to create a complete nar­
rative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus 
on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and 
retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find 
and repair bugs, or things that happen differently than expected, 
in their scripts. 
It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember 
to save your work often by tapping the Home button at the top 
of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it 
is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue 
working.

You’ve already made some animations

How to Make It
1.	 Select the summer background and delete the cat character. 
You can see that the tree on the left already has some peaches 
on it, but these are just part of the background and they can-
not move. To get a peach that will move when we tap it, we 
need to add it to our scene as a character.
2.	 To do this, tap the plus sign in the character area and select 
the peach. Drag the peach onto the tree that already has three 
peaches on it.
3.	 We want to make the peach close to the same size as the other 
peaches on the tree, so tap the purple looks blocks category. 
Drag the Shrink block to your peach’s programming area and 
tap it twice. The first tap will make the peach smaller, and the 
second tap will make it even smaller.

4.	 Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the Shrink 
block back to the blocks palette to delete it.
5.	 Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of

Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which 
brings characters to life when you tap them.

6.	 Drag the Start on Tap block to the programming area to 
start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this 
triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from 
the tree. 
7.	 Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.
We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to 
play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen 
to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the 
ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not 
return characters to their original positions like the Start on 
Green Flag block does.  
You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the Reset 
Characters button at the top of the screen. 
The Reset Characters button will return all characters to 
their home positions. 

Gam es
101
If you have other characters moving around on the stage and 
you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer 
to reset just the peach. 
8.	 Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.

2
9.	 Drag the Go Home block to the end of the peach’s script.
Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has 
fallen, and you can play the game again!
Hints
You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before 
it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump 
straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the Wait 
block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.
Looking for a Challenge?
To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches 
to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe 
enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles 
on the tree and stays put.

Literacy Connection: Adding to the Story
Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a 
story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they 
surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and 
the Add Text button to incorporate speaking and words into 
your story. You can look back at Chapters 2 and 3 if you need 
help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend 
and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page! 
Math Connection:  
Composing and Comparing Shapes
Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different 
types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the 
biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the vari-
ous shapes and sizes you used. 
Tips for Grown-ups
It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character 
lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion 
as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, 
it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If 
the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child 
taps it, that’s the likely cause.

Activity 13: Blast Off!
In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship 
blasts off! 
What You’ll Learn
You’ll learn how to get the characters to 
work together, using the Send Message 
and Start on Message blocks. The cat 
will count down the seconds, and then 
the rocket will blast off!
How to Make It
1.	 Start by adding the moon background and the rocket 
character.
2.	 Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to 
return to it. Drag a Start on Green Flag block to the 
programming area.

3.	 Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three Say blocks 
to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.” 
4.	 Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send 
Message block.

5.	 Drag the Send Message block down to the programming area 
and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.
This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has 
finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to 
receive. 
6.	 Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make 
the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the 
cat. Start the script with the Start on Message block. This 
script will run when another script sends a message.  

Gam es
105
7.	 After the Start on Message block, add a Move Up block to 
make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and 
then add a Hide block to make the rocket disappear.
8.	 Now, tap the Green Flag button to try out the script.
Hints
This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six dif-
ferent message colors to communicate between characters in your 
project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to 
match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an 
orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with 
an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple 
Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins 
with an orange Start on Message block will never run!

Ch apter 4
106
Looking for a Challenge?
Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a 
Start on Message block. You could have a crowd of characters 
cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the 
same color Start on Message block. 
Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as 
the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message 
as the crowd? 
Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on 
Message block of the same color will start at the same time 
when a Send Message block of that color is used.

Making Connections
107
Literacy Connection:  
Getting Ready for Takeoff
Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an 
announcement about what is going to happen. Use the Say 
block and the Add Text button to prepare for the rocket’s take-
off. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off? 
Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket 
travels! 
Math Connection: Counting Backward
Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the 
amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. 
When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After 
programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count 
down from 10, 15, and even 20! 
Tips for Grown-ups
You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement 
that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the 
characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as 
the announcement will listen for the announcement and react 
to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.

Activity 14: Play Tag!
Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s 
script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will 
tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the 
program.
What You’ll Learn
In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting 
block: the Start on Bump block. 
Start on
Bump
The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the 
character bumps into another character.

How to Make It
1.	 Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat 
and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five 
steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions 
aren’t quite right when you try out your script. 
The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it 
will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to 
tag it. We’ll add a Repeat Forever block to the cat’s script 
so the cat and the dog will play again and again. 
2.	 Create the following script for the cat:

Ch apter 4
110
3.	 The dog’s script uses the Start on Bump block so that it 
starts when the dog is bumped by the cat. 
1
2
After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the 
cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, 
say “Tag!” and run away. 
4.	 Create the following script for the dog:
We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, 
because the Start on Bump block will run every time the 
dog is tagged.
5.	 Tap the Green Flag button to watch your characters play tag! 
Press the Stop button when you want the game to end.
Hints
If a character is touching another character that has a Start on 
Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters 
are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so 
close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump 
script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and 
over again until you move the cat away from the dog.

Gam es
111
Looking for a Challenge?
See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your proj-
ect and make it move all around the stage with a few different 
Start on Green Flag scripts that repeat forever. (See “Look-
ing for a Challenge?” on page 56 to see how to use two scripts 
together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of 
the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they 
say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make 
the game more exciting!
Remember that you can get your characters to talk and per-
form actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same 
programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a 
Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start 
on Green Flag block. 

Making Connections
112
Literacy Connection:  
Creating a Conversation Between Friends
Use the Say block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other 
while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and 
“You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punc-
tuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? 
Does someone give up? Remember to use the Start on Bump 
and Wait blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense 
with the way the characters are moving. 
Math Connection: Estimating
To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate 
what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue 
motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them 
out to see what works best with your program! 
Tips for Grown-ups
This activity repeats using a combination of the Repeat For-
ever block and the Start on Bump block. While it might seem 
like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump 
block just like the dog, this approach won’t work! 
If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be 
triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is mov-
ing or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. 
The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again. 

Gam es
113
Activity 15: Guess the Odd One Out!
Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and 
family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, 
but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. 
Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one 
out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, 
“Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You 
got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.
What You’ll Learn
You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the 
Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how 
to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for 
the same character.

How to Make It
1.	 Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the 
farm background would be one good choice. 
2.	 Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program 
four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of 
them to move differently.
3.	 Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a 
square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when 
it is tapped. 
4.	 Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of 
the animals have the exact same scripts. 
Note that instead of making a new script for each of the 
animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by 
simply dragging the script from the programming area to the 
animal in the list of characters. 

Gam es
115
5.	 Change the time on each script’s Wait block so that the 
animals will start moving at different times.  
6.	 Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra Move 
Down block to make the animal move slightly differently than 
the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says 
“You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop 
moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks cat-
egory and drag a Stop block to the end of the animal’s script.
7.	 When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the 
Enter Presentation Mode button to hide the programming 
area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.

Looking for a Challenge?
When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you 
can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the 
game is won. You will have to use a Send Message block and 
give each of the other animals a Start on Message script that 
stops its motion.

Literacy Connection:  
Writing the Game Directions
How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-
by-step instructions for the player using Say blocks or the Add 
Text button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the 
correct animal? 
Math Connection:  
Writing Your Own Math Problems
The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and 
Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet 
for this game? You could write problems like “How many move-
ments does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”
Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s 
math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark 
each other’s answers. 
Tips for Grown-ups
The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that 
has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a 
script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger 
(tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a mes-
sage, and so on).

Project Time! Cats Versus Birds
Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. 
We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three 
moving cats and touch the mushroom to win. 
When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, 
but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go 
back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom 
safely, the player wins!
The player
controls
this bird.
Avoid
these cats!
Reach the
mushroom
to win.
How to Make It
1.	 Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good 
option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in. 
2.	 Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side 
of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the 
stage. 
3.	 Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the 
stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.

Gam es
119
4.	 Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by 
changing the speed in the Set Speed block so it is differ-
ent for each cat. You need to make another script to send 
an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that 
the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an 
example of our script for one cat:

Ch apter 4
120
5.	 Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then 
add a script to make it go back to its home position when an 
orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:
6.	 Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped 
by the bird:
7.	 To play the game, tap the Enter Presentation Mode button.

Gam es
121
You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned 
in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the move-
ment of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and 
reaches the mushroom. Good luck!
Hints
Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mush-
room when they move around the screen. Bumps between any 
characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on 
Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from 
the bird.
Looking for a Challenge?
Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make 
the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this 
game easier or more difficult?

Making Connections
122
Literacy Connection:  
Turning Your Game into a Story
Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explain-
ing why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there some-
thing special about this mushroom? 
The second page can be the game, and the third page can 
be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For 
example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you 
reached the mushroom!”
Math Connection: Keeping a Tally
Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the 
number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up 
once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of 
times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player 
have the same outcome?
Tips for Grown-ups 
When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird 
instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new 
location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when 
the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will 
no longer go back to the edge of the stage. 
To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—
a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, 
you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner 
of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.

123
The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, 
like this: 
Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward 
when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the 
blue message from the star.
If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a 
problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and 
the game can carry on.


Even though you’ve reached the end 
of the book, you are only just getting 
started with programming. The goal of 
this book is to guide you in helping the

and, in the process, learn to design projects, solve problems, 
reason systematically, and express themselves creatively. 
When your child has mastered all that ScratchJr has to offer, 
it might be time to introduce Scratch and its active online commu-
nity. In Appendix A, you will find resources for this transition.
We have worked hard to bring coding to young children in a 
developmentally appropriate way. It is our strong belief that pro-
gramming opens new ways of thinking and new forms of expres-
sion. We hope to continue making improvements to ScratchJr 
and creating new resources and opportunities for learning and 
sharing. We want ScratchJr to remain free so anyone, anywhere, 
can use it. So far, we have been able to do so through generous 
grants from the National Science ­Foundation and the Scratch 
Foundation. If you believe in our vision and want to support us, 
please consider making a donation to the Scratch Foundation 
(http://www.scratchfoundation.org/). Any amount, large or small, 
is appreciated.
Let’s keep coding!
Marina and Mitch

When you’re ready to take the next step 
in your programming journey, we recom-
mend trying out Scratch, a programming 
tool designed for slightly older learners 
(ages 8 and up). Scratch offers additional 
features that enable children to ­create 
Appendix A
Transitioning  
from ScratchJr  
to Scratch

Appendix A
128
more advanced stories, games, and animations, but its basic 
programming approach is similar to ScratchJr, so it will feel 
familiar. 
You will know that children are ready to move on to Scratch 
when they can tell a story or make a game independently with 
ScratchJr or when they are ready to start creating more advanced 
projects. 
For example, children can use Scratch to do the following:
• Create games that keep score
• Import images and sounds
• Make characters move at any angle (not just up, down, 
left, and right)
• Program characters to change “costumes” within a 
project
• Create stories that are longer and more complex (more 
than four pages) 
The Scratch Community
Perhaps the biggest difference between Scratch and ScratchJr is 
that Scratch is integrated into an online community, so it is easy 
for children to share their projects with one another, comment 
on one another’s projects, and even remix one another’s projects 
(that is, make variations of other people’s projects using some of 
their characters and programming scripts). 
This social dimension of Scratch is very appealing to many 
children and opens up opportunities for them to collaborate 
and learn from one another. But younger children might not 
be ready to participate in an online community. Before a child 
joins the Scratch community, you should make sure to have a 

Transitio ning from ScratchJr to Scratch

discussion about appropriate online behavior. Also make sure to 
read the community guidelines on the Scratch website (https://
scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines/).
Getting Started with Scratch
Scratch runs in any web browser (such as Internet Explorer, 
Firefox, or Chrome) and on any type of laptop or desktop com-
puter. To get started with Scratch, go to the Scratch website at 
http://scratch.mit.edu/. There you’ll be able to explore more than 
10 million projects created by other members of the Scratch com-
munity, and start creating your own projects. Click Help in the 
top navigation bar to see all the resources available to get you 
started and answer your questions. 
If you want guided help with creating your first project, click 
the Step-by-Step Intro. You will see the project editor and a 
Tips sidebar with a step-by-step tutorial on how to make a proj-
ect similar to the one that you made in Chapter 1 of this book.
