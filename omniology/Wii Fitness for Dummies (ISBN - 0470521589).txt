Introduction
E
xercise and gaming — who thought the twain would ever meet? At least 
not until Wii Fit came along. Sure, there were other fitness titles on other 
platforms prior to the Wii, but Nintendo’s console really helped bring the 
genre mainstream. Why is this? Well, for the first time, there was a way to 
accurately track even subtle body movements and provide feedback in real 
time. Wii Fit was engaging, giving you the sense that a personal trainer was 
right there with you, and you weren’t just haphazardly mimicking actions 
observed onscreen while a lifeless automaton cycled through the same 
repertoire of encouragement.
Certainly, as with all things, there are skeptics. Some may even smirk upon 
seeing a “videogame” book categorized as a fitness title, but those folks likely 
never gave “exergaming” a try or are hardcore fitness enthusiasts who spend 
hours pumping iron or putting the treadmill to its paces at the gym. There is 
certainly nothing wrong with that, unless taken to the extreme, but even if we 
wanted to, most of us simply don’t have the time or resources to devote to 
that type of lifestyle. For us, exergames can be a great and fun way to make 
regular physical activity a part of our lifestyle, rain or shine.
We concede that some fitness titles are certainly better than others at 
yielding results and offering guidance and feedback, but we believe if you try 
any of the games covered in this For Dummies book—Wii Fit Plus, EA Sports 
Active: Personal Trainer, Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 — you will 
feel like you are doing your body good (be sure to turn to Chapter 14 to get a 
glimpse of even more games). Time is exceptionally precious in this harried 
world, and our goal is to help you make the most of the time you devote to 
these Wii fitness titles.
Conventions Used in This Book
Our objective is to help you get away from some of your conventions of 
daily living — those things that you do day in and day out — by helping you 
incorporate Wii fitness in your life. To facilitate this, we use conventions 
throughout this book. Although it seems ironic using conventions to get 
away from conventions, consistency is important when it comes to writing, 
especially when the objective is to provide an instructional guide.

2
Wii Fitness For Dummies
To lead you on your Wii fitness journey, we always refer to exercises the way 
that the manufacturer does, even if its title seems a little off. For instance, we 
cover Tricep Extension and Jumping Jack in Chapters 3 and 11, respectively, 
even though these are more commonly referred to as Triceps Extensions and 
Jumping Jacks. This allows you to easily identify the exercises covered in the 
software in this book.
Whenever any of the equipment is mentioned, such as the Balance Board, 
Wii Remote, Leg Strap, and Resistance Band, these items are captialized. This 
allows you to more readily identify any necessary equipment when skimming 
sections of the book.
We also use the word click quite a bit throughout, such as click the A button 
or click the Next button. The Wii Remote functions much like a computer 
mouse and the word click best describes the required action. Last, whenever 
we provide you with URLs for Websites, these appear in monospace font, 
ensuring they stand out. After all, these URLs are important to help you 
troubleshoot any issues with your equipment or to expand on the software’s 
offering, allowing you to boost your Wii fitness potential.
Why You Need This Book
In discussing Wii Fitness For Dummies with family, friends, and other 
individuals, some questioned, “Do you really need a book for that?” If you 
are reading this section, you are no doubt wondering this yourself. After all, 
these games generally have easy-to-navigate interfaces and do a great job 
of guiding you through each activity by demonstrating movements and 
providing feedback, making a For Dummies book seem superfluous. Although 
this book does provide you with a reinforcement of what the games already 
do well, its scope goes well beyond that.
Contained within these lovingly crafted pages, you also find tips on optimally 
performing the activities and navigating menus, suggestions for alternatives 
or variations on the exercises, additional routines, and countless useful 
figures and tables for quick reference. We also delve into exercise theory and 
physiology, dispelling common myths and noting how these activities can 
benefit your body. Most of the activities offered in each of the titles we cover, 
namely Wii Fit Plus, EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer, and Jillian Michaels 
Fitness Ultimatum 2010, are common exercises. Our goal is to give you a solid 
understanding of how to perform these activities so that you are confident in 
your ability to perform the exercises even without the guidance of your Wii.

 Introduction
How to Use This Book
Unlike works of fiction or other narratives, this book does not have to be 
read in a linear fashion or in totality for that matter. Each section stands 
alone, and some parts may be more useful to you than others because this 
book covers three distinct fitness titles, some of which you may not own. 
Identifying the parts that are most relevant to you is a breeze thanks to the 
For Dummies style. Each chapter contains many subsections, each of which 
is outlined in the book’s comprehensive table of contents, and every chapter 
features an “In This Chapter” introduction, which includes a bulleted list of 
the chapter’s scope. With this setup, you are never left wondering what’s 
covered. If you still can’t find what you’re looking for, turn to the index, 
where you can search for a topic alphabetically instead.
As for more specific uses, if you have just purchased one of the titles covered 
in this book, consider going through the part of the book devoted to that 
title before popping the program into your console. If you don’t have time to 
read that entire section, at least glance at the Getting Started chapter for that 
program, which will give you a good sense of what to expect from the game 
and allow you to make the most of the program from the very beginning. 
For example, when playing EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer, you may be 
tempted to use a Guest Pass the first time you play, but if you read Chapter 7, 
you find out why it makes sense to establish a fitness profile from the get-go.
You can also use this book to get a quick overview of an exercise. Although 
you will want to watch any tutorial videos before performing an activity 
for the first time, you may not want to watch them subsequently. You can 
use this book to get a quick overview of an activity before performing it; for 
instance, if you forgot an arm or foot placement.
Finally, having three fitness titles outlined in one book allows you to easily 
compare activities and capabilities between the different games. This can be 
handy if you own multiple titles, as it can facilitate deciding which game you 
want to work out with at any given time. It can also help you decide whether

Foolish Assumptions
Whether your exercise bike is collecting dust or you are already a fitness 
enthusiast, we assume that you bought this book because you are looking to 
incorporate Wii fitness in your life. Our goal is to help you achieve this, no 

4
Wii Fitness For Dummies
matter how much or how little guidance you need. For Wii or exercise 
novices, there is support throughout this book on navigating the software 
and performing the exercises. On the other hand, for those more experienced 
in either area, there are countless tips, scoring and gameplay information, 
exercise variations, and other fitness and Wii tidbits that may help enhance 
the Wii fitness experience.
Although some of the activities in the book do not require a Wii Balance 
Board, and many of the activities in each of the three software titles covered 
here — Wii Fit Plus, EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer, and Jillian Michaels 
Fitness Ultimatum 2010 — could be performed even without a Wii, we assume 
you either own a Balance Board or are looking to invest in one, as it greatly 
expands your Wii fitness options. 
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into four parts; the first three cover a popular fitness 
title for the Wii. The fourth is the Part of Tens, a staple of For Dummies 
books; it provides an overview of fitness accessories and other exercise titles 
available for the Wii. Each part consists of several chapters, all of which 
have multiple subsections. To find the information you need, you can simply 
skim chapters, refer to the table of contents, or peruse the index. Of course 
for maximum benefit, you can also read chapters in their entirety, which we 
hope you will.
Part I: Wii Fit Plus
Part I consists of six chapters. Chapter 1 provides you with an overview 
of Wii Fit Plus, including everything you need to know to get started, such 
as familiarizing yourself with the Balance Board and navigating the menus. 
Chapter 2 details the series of body tests that you will be asked to perform to 
establish a baseline and monitor your fitness progress. The remainder cover 
each exercise category offered by Wii Fit Plus, including yoga, balance games, 
strength training, and aerobics.
Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer
Part II, which starts with Chapter 7, gives you the information you need to get 
started. It examines the equipment that comes with this title, including the 
Resistance Band and the Leg Strap, and covers how to navigate the menu, 

5
 Introduction
establish your fitness profile, use the fitness journal, and more. Chapter 8 
covers the available exercises, which are broken out by upper body, lower 
body, cardio, and sports activities. The last chapter covers the routines, from 
selecting preset to customizing your own; we even give you a few specialized 
routines that you can try.
Part III: Jillian Michaels 
Fitness Ultimatum 2010
Some may wonder why we decided to include this title in the book, 
especially since its predecessor, Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2009, 
received rather poor reviews overall. Certainly this game is not of the same 
caliber as Wii Fit Plus or EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer, but it offers a 
unique approach to working out with its less traditional exercises and more 
ballistic activities, such as swing kicks and water pump. Part III starts with 
an overview of this title, including navigating the menus, creating your 
character, enrolling in the Hell-week style boot camp, and tracking your 
stats. The second chapter in this section reviews the training options and 
discusses how to determine your regimen based on your objectives. The final 
chapter provides an overview of all the exercises.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Part IV includes two chapters. The first, Chapter 13, gives an overview of the 
fitness and other accessories that you may want to consider to enhance your 
workouts, covering everything from exercise mats to wireless Nunchuks. 
Chapter 14 offers a glimpse of ten other fitness titles for the Wii that you may 
want to consider adding to your Wii fitness library.
Icons Used in This Book
In the left-hand margins of this book, you notice one or more icons, each of 
which has a distinct purpose and is vying for your attention. The three icons 
used are as follows:
 
As the name implies, this icon draws attention to information that you can

Part I
Wii Fit Plus

In this part . . .
W
elcome to a life of improved health and well-being 
with Wii fitness! This part of the book details 
Nintendo’s insanely popular Wii Fit Plus and many of the 
core exercise concepts that translate to the other Wii fit-
ness games and working out in general. Here you are 
introduced to the Wii Fit Plus software and the revolution-
ary Balance Board accessory. You also learn about your 
center of balance, body mass index, and the other impor-
tant health information gleaned from Wii Fit Plus’s various 
fitness tests. Next, you dig into the yoga and strength 
training exercises, and then proceed to the section on My 
Fit Plus, where you gain important knowledge about calo-
ries, exercise routines, and more. Then, you learn how to 
get your heart pumping by jumping into aerobics. This 
section concludes with an overview of the Training Plus 
and balance games, which are both fun and challenging.

Chapter 1
Getting Started
In This Chapter
▶ Getting acquainted with Wii Fit Plus
▶ Preparing your Mii
▶ Using the Balance Board and other controls
▶ Navigating the Wii Fit Plus software
A
fter you make the decision to incorporate Wii Fit Plus into your healthy 
lifestyle, the first step is to set up the system. Unlike most games, 
setting up Wii Fit Plus is a multistep process befitting its unique combination 
of sophisticated hardware and software. This chapter helps to make this 
process a breeze so that you can get down to the serious — yet surprisingly 
fun — business of working out.
In this chapter, you find out how to set up Wii Fit Plus to work with your Wii 
console. You also discover how to activate your Balance Board, prepare your 
Mii for the activities ahead, and establish your baseline physical fitness level. 
We go over what the Balance Board can and can’t do, how the Wii Remote 
and Nunchuk are used, and how to navigate around the many Wii Fit Plus 
menus.
Introducing Wii Fit Plus
One of the major reasons the Wii Fit phenomena has been so strong is 
because it relies on a unique bundled peripheral called the Balance Board. 
This innovative wireless controller has become the face of the Wii fitness 
revolution, adding a new dimension of interactivity far beyond what is 
possible with just the Wii Remote and Nunchuk.
Although the original Wii Fit features over 40 strength training, aerobics, 
yoga, and balance activities, the exercise experience is unstructured and 
mostly solitary. Although not a radical change, Wii Fit Plus adds over 20 
more activities, provides preset routines and customizable workouts, has a 

10
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) calculator that tracks calories burned 
based on how much exertion is required to perform a movement, and 
offers far more robust multiplayer support, making this updated version a 
worthwhile investment for old and new Wii fitness enthusiasts alike.
What’s in the Box
Wii Fit Plus comes in two flavors: a box set with the Wii Fit Plus software and 
the Balance Board, or, for those who already own the original Wii Fit, just the 
Wii Fit Plus software.
Inside the oversized Wii Fit Plus box, shown in Figure 1-1, you find the 
following:
 
✓ Wii Balance Board: The plastic Balance Board is a flat, rounded, 
rectangular platform that can support a standing weight of up to 330 
pounds. Through four Balance Sensors located on the bottom of the 
board, both weight (pressure) and balance can be measured. The board 
is battery operated and communicates wirelessly with the Wii console 
via Bluetooth, just like your Wii Remote.
 
✓ Wii Fit Plus software: Like most other Wii software, the Wii Fit Plus 
program comes in a plastic snap case that contains the Wii Fit Plus 
game disc, instruction booklet, registration information, and marketing 
material.
 
✓ Wii Balance Board foot extensions: If you plan to use the Balance 
Board on a thick carpet, one extension can be placed on each of the four 
balance sensors to provide sufficient clearance under the bottom of the 
platform to ensure proper measurements.
 
✓ Wii Balance Board Operations Manual: An instruction manual specific 
to the Balance Board hardware. A portion of this information is repeated 
in the Wii Fit Plus instruction booklet.
 
✓ AA batteries: For the Wii Balance Board to function, the four included 
batteries or suitable replacements must be placed in the well under the 
battery cover on the bottom of the board. Quality AA batteries can last 
approximately 60 hours.
Carefully remove these items from the box and discard the packing materials 
properly. You may wish to save the Wii Fit Plus box for future storage or 
transportation of the Balance Board, particularly because it features a 
convenient carrying handle.

Hooking Up the Components
At this point we assume you already have your Nintendo Wii set up and 
working, and at least one Mii stored on your console. If not, refer to the Wii 
Operations Manual that came with your console or, for additional detail, 
Wii For Dummies by Kyle Orland (Wiley Publishing). As for Wii Fit Plus, follow 
these setup steps after inserting your disc and starting the game, and you can 
be on your way to fitness and fun in no time flat:
 
1. Press A on your Wii Remote after you are comfortable with the 
Wii Remote Strap Usage screen instructions or simply wait to 
automatically proceed.
 
 If this is your first time playing Wii Fit Plus, you will have to create and 
save data and synchronize the Balance Board.
 
2. On the Wii Fit Plus save-data creation screen, press A on the Wii 
Remote.

12
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
 If you are upgrading from Wii Fit, Wii Fit Plus makes use of your previous 
data. After the save data has been created, a confirmation screen 
appears. Press A again. If you already have Wii Fit data, you are taken on 
a brief tour of Wii Fit Plus’s new features, and you can either skip ahead 
to the “Incorporating the Wii Remote and Nunchuk” section of this 
chapter, if you want a refresher on controller functionality, or go 
straight to the “Navigating the Wii Fit Plus Menus” section. Otherwise, 
you’ll be prompted to sync the Balance Board to the Wii.
 
3. Remove the battery cover on the bottom of the Balance Board and 
insert the four AA batteries if you have not done so already. Then 
press the small red SYNC. button, as shown in Figure 1-2.
 
 The blue power light on the Balance Board should now be flashing.
 
Figure 1-2: 
The Balance 
Board 
with the 
battery 
cover 
removed.
 
 
4. Open the SD Card slot cover on the front of the Wii console next to the 
system disc slot. While the blue power light on the Balance Board is 
still flashing, press the red SYNC. button on the Wii console, as shown 
in Figure 1-3.
 
 The power light on the Balance Board stops blinking and remains lit 
after the synchronization is complete.

13
 Chapter 1: Getting Started
 
Figure 1-3: 
The open 
SD Card slot 
cover on the 
front of the 
Wii console.
 
 
 Do not press and hold the rectangular SYNC. button on the Wii console 
for more than ten seconds; otherwise, all synchronization information 
for all your Wii Remotes will be deleted and you’ll need to resynchronize 
them per the instructions in the Wii Operations Manual.
 
5. Close the SD Card slot and Balance Board battery cover. Return the 
Balance Board to its upright position.
 
Only one Balance Board can be registered to a single Wii console at any one 
time. Any new Balance Board synchronization will overwrite the current 
registration information. Because the Balance Board uses the Player 4 
connection, any board-compatible software is limited to a maximum of a 
single board and three other controllers.
If all steps were followed correctly, the virtual Wii Balance Board greets 
you and serves as your animated anthropomorphic tour guide when you’re 
playing Wii Fit Plus.
After a brief intro, you are asked to verify your console’s date and time. If the 
settings are correct, use your remote to select Correct; otherwise choose 
Incorrect and make the necessary adjustments.

14
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
You are asked to choose a Mii already saved on your Wii system to represent 
yourself. The Miis from the Mii Channel’s Mii Plaza appear on your screen in 
groups of up to ten. If you have more than ten Miis on your system, you can 
click the arrows on the left and right sides of the screen to scroll through the 
list or press – or +, respectively, on your Wii Remote. Select your favorite 
virtual representation of you and press A on your Wii Remote to confirm.
Establishing Your Baseline
Now that you’ve confirmed the date and time and chosen the Mii for you, 
the virtual Wii Balance Board begins to step you through the introductions, 
which you can choose to read or skip. The first major task the virtual Wii 
Balance Board will have you do is a quick Body Test to establish your 
physical fitness baseline, which includes your weight, Center of Balance, 
Body Mass Index (BMI), body control, and Wii Fit Age. Turn to Chapter 2 for 
a comprehensive explanation of each of these measures and the tests used to 
assess them.
Initial body measurements
When prompted, enter your height and birth date. Point and click on either 
the up or down arrow on the screen to increase or decrease the values, 
respectively. After this information is entered, you are prompted to either 
change or accept the data by pressing OK. After you’re satisfied, click OK.
 
Be sure to enter your real birth date for accurate analysis. If for some reason 
you’re concerned that others who will be playing your Wii Fit Plus will be 
able to see this or your other personal information — such as your weight — 
you have the opportunity to enter a personal identification number (PIN), 
described later in this chapter, so only you have access to these data.
Follow these steps to create your baseline readings:
 
1. Place your Balance Board directly in front of the screen, three to ten 
feet back.
 
 The board’s power button should be facing away from the television, 
where the text for both Wii and Power on the top surface of the board is 
readable. After a brief synchronization, you are instructed to step on the 
Balance Board (be sure you’re holding the Wii Remote).
 
 Before stepping on the Balance Board, ensure that there is sufficient 
clearance underneath, particularly if it is placed on a rug. If there is not 
sufficient clearance, use the Wii Balance Board Foot Extensions.

15
 Chapter 1: Getting Started
 
2. Step on and remain still.
 
 If you move, or fidget, Wii Fit Plus will have trouble taking a baseline 
reading and you’ll be instructed to step off and restart the process. After 
Wii Fit Plus gets a successful reading, it will ask how heavy your clothes 
are: Light (-2 lbs.), Heavy (-4 lbs.), or Other. Use your best judgment and 
select your answer using the Wii Remote and pressing A. If you select 
Other, you can press up and down on your Wii Remote’s directional pad 
to respectively raise or lower the starting value of 0 lbs.
 
 It is recommended that you use the Balance Board barefoot. Socks can 
be too slippery and shoes might not provide enough range of motion or 
the tactile response necessary to perform certain activities. One good 
alternative to bare feet is to wear non-slip Yoga, Pilates, or “toe” socks, 
which provide traction and a full range of motion with minimal tactile 
loss.
 
 After you step on the Balance Board, a large green semicircle starts 
moving on the screen. This represents your Center of Balance. Try to 
keep the green semicircle centered.
. 
 Wii Fit Plus now prompts to measure your Center of Balance. If you 
fidget too much, you have to start over, so it is important to have a 
relaxed, stable stance. If you remain sufficiently still, you receive your 
Center of Balance results. Don’t worry if your balance is dramatically off 
center, as this is just an initial reading, and as you continue to use your 
Wii Fit Plus, your results should improve.
 
3. When ready, continue pressing the A button to proceed through the 
informational prompts until you come to the first test.
 
 You are now asked to align your Center of Balance by shifting your 
bodyweight until the red dot rests in the blue circle in the middle of the 
onscreen Balance Board.
 
4. After you receive your results, press the A button to proceed.
 
 You should now see your Body Mass Index, or BMI, results, which is a 
rough measure of body fat based on your height and weight. You will 
learn more about BMI in Chapter 2, but for now just accept the verdict 
as an arbitrary baseline that will be useful as a future point of reference 
to improve upon.
 
 Don’t be alarmed if Wii Fit Plus changes the appearance of your Mii’s 
waistline in either direction. Remember, Wii Fit Plus can’t see how you 
really look; it can only guess based on statistics, which don’t always 
reflect reality.
 
5. Press A to show two menu options, Weight and Next.
 
 Selecting Weight shows how much you weigh in pounds. If you select 
your weight, you have the option of going back to the BMI screen or 
clicking Next. If Next is selected, you are taken to the Body Control tests.

16
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
The Balance Board is said to be more accurate than the average bathroom 
scale, so if you find your weight to be completely off, it could be because you 
don’t have enough clearance below your Balance Board, indicating foot 
extensions are warranted. See “Understanding Balance Board Capabilities” 
later in this chapter for more on this. Some variation in weight is normal, 
however, and your weight can fluctuate by several pounds each day.
Body control baseline
Because this is your first time using Wii Fit Plus, your body control 
assessment starts with the Basic Balance Test. For a more comprehensive 
overview of this test, turn to Chapter 2.
To set up your body control baseline, follow these steps:
 
1. Press A on the controller until you reach the Basic Balance Test, 
where you are presented with brief instructions and a prompt to press 
A to start. Spread your feet evenly apart on the Balance Board and 
press A when ready.
 
2. Balance left and right on the board to keep each of the red bars in its 
respective blue area for three seconds.
 
 You go through a few practice rounds before the countdown to the real 
trial, which challenges you to make often dramatic left and right shifts 
and then hold your position for three seconds. You have 30 seconds to 
finish all five rounds. If you are unable to finish them within the allotted 
time, you are given a default score of 30 seconds. The less time you take 
to finish the Basic Balance Test, the better your score.
 
3. Press A to proceed.
 
 After receiving either good-natured ribbing or praise about your Basic 
Balance Test performance, you are presented with your Wii Fit Age. 
Much like BMI, consider your Wii Fit Age, which is described in greater 
detail in Chapter 2, an arbitrary baseline that will be useful as a future 
point of reference.
 
4. Press A on the controller until you’re prompted to stamp your 
progress on the calendar. Point your Wii Remote at your TV screen 
and press A to stamp today’s date with a footprint.
 
 Congratulations, you’re now official!
 
5. Press A to continue after reading each of the information prompts 
until you reach the Goal screen.
 
 Wii Fit Plus suggests a goal based on your analysis. For example, if 
you’re overweight, it may suggest setting a goal to help bring your BMI 
down. Regardless of its suggestion, the goal is yours to set.

17
 Chapter 1: Getting Started
 
 You can point and click on either the up or down arrow on the screen to 
increase or decrease your weight goal, respectively, which in turn shows 
the effect on your BMI rating, up or down. Be sure to set a reasonable 
initial goal: no more than a few pounds to gain or lose, depending on 
your needs. After your selection is made, you’ll be prompted for a deadline. 
The default is two weeks from today, which is the minimum span of time 
and a figure you may or may not be able to increase depending upon 
what goal you selected. For example, if you selected to lose only one 
pound, the maximum amount of time you can set to reach that goal is 
three months. Alternately, if you selected to lose two pounds, the maximum 
amount of time can be set to six months. As you change your deadline, 
the calculation shown for what you’ll need to lose or gain every two 
weeks changes as well. After selected, you’ll be prompted to either 
Change your goal or to click OK to proceed. We discuss setting goals in 
more detail in Chapter 2, so for now, click OK.
 
 You can make a new goal and deadline every week, so don’t worry too 
much about setting this initial goal. It’s more important at this early 
stage to familiarize yourself with the software and exercises.
 
6. Press A to continue after reading each of the information prompts 
until you reach the Password prompt screen.
 
 Selecting Yes allows you to protect your profile with a password if you 
wish to hide your weight and other data from others. Using a password 
is discussed in detail in Chapter 2. For now, either select No or Yes. If 
you select Yes, you are asked to enter a four-digit PIN for a password. 
When prompted, reenter the number to confirm. Press A to continue 
through the information prompts.
 
 You should now be prompted with the option to register a family 
member or friend (this prompt does not apply if you already have all 
eight available slots filled). Selecting No brings you to the Calendar 
screen, while selecting Yes brings you to the Wii Fit Plaza. See 
“Navigating the Wii Fit Plus Menus” later in this chapter for an explanation 
of your options at each of these screens. But first, let’s find out more 
about the Balance Board.
Understanding Balance 
Board Capabilities
Your Wii Balance Board is a stylishly designed and solidly built technological 
marvel. Through its four evenly placed Balance Sensors located underneath, 
the board is able to detect both the amount and relative location of the 
pressure applied to any of its quadrants. The board can then wirelessly 
transmit these data to your Wii console in real time, just like your Wii Remote. 

18
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
With support for a standing weight of up to 330 pounds and an impact 
force of over 600 pounds, the board accommodates a fairly broad range of 
individual body types, abilities, and general usage.
For the Balance Board to do its job accurately, you need to ensure that the 
sensors have sufficient clearance underneath, particularly if your Balance 
Board is being used on a rug. If any surface is touching the bottom surface 
of your board, you need to use the Wii Balance Board Foot Extensions to 
gain additional height. Placing the extensions is a simple process. Just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Turn the Balance Board over and ensure that each of the four sensors 
is free of any dirt or debris.
 
2. Push one foot extension straight into each of the four sensors.
 
 Ensure each extension is pushed in all the way so there is no imbalance.
 
3. Return the Balance Board to its original position and verify clearance.
 
 If there is still insufficient clearance under your Balance Board after 
placing the extensions, you either need to find a way to clear any 
obstruction or move your Wii to another, more suitable location.
Although a range of typically silicon non-slip covers is widely available in 
stores, the Balance Board already has its own textured surface. This textured 
surface is located on each half of the top of the board in an approximately 5 
x 9-inch area, where you would roughly place each foot. For this surface to 
do its job, you must be barefoot or use non-slip socks, which also maximizes 
your range of motion and feel for the board.
 
Be sure to keep the Balance Board dry during exercise. Sweat on the surface 
of the board can make for a potentially slippery — and dangerous — situation. 
Having a towel handy is a big help!
Even if you never use your Balance Board barefoot or share its use, at some 
point your board will need cleaning. Remember that even though it may 
not look it, your Balance Board is a sensitive electronic device that must be 
treated with care. To clean your board, follow these steps:
 
1. Wipe your Balance Board with a soft lint-free towel to remove any 
loose dirt or debris.
 
2. Wipe the board with a disinfectant wipe or a lint-free towel sprayed 
with a disinfectant cleaner.
 
 Never spray liquids of any type directly on the board.
 
3. Dry your board with a clean, dry, lint-free towel.
 
4. Allow the board to dry completely before use.

19
 Chapter 1: Getting Started
 
If control on your Wii Balance Board seems inconsistent or otherwise 
incorrect, the typical culprit is depleted batteries. As with most electronics, a 
fresh set of batteries can make all the difference. If performance continues to 
be erratic after putting in new batteries, you can choose Settings in the Wii Fit 
Plaza and select the Wii Balance Board Check, which verifies proper sensor 
function. If your Balance Board has malfunctioned, visit www.support.
nintendo.com or call Nintendo’s hotline at 1-800-255-3700 for assistance.
Incorporating the Wii Remote 
and Nunchuk
Although most of Wii Fit Plus’s more interesting functionality revolves 
around use of the Balance Board, you still use your Wii Remote to navigate 
the menus and begin exercises. As always, before using the Wii Remote, it is 
important to use the wrist strap and Wii Remote Jacket for maximum safety, 
particularly because you are likely to be breaking a sweat.
 
Though not necessary, wearing shorts or pants with pockets is helpful so 
you can safely place the Wii Remote in them when performing running 
exercises. You can also opt to use other alternatives, such as the EA Sports 
Active: Personal Trainer Leg Strap, which is described in Chapter 7. Otherwise, 
you can simply hold the Wii Remote in your hand.
Be sure to familiarize yourself with the Wii Remote Settings menu. This 
menu is accessible at any time by pressing the Home button on an active Wii 
Remote and then clicking the Wii Remote Settings panel on the bottom of 
the screen with the A button. To leave this menu, click the Close Wii Remote 
Settings panel at the bottom of the screen or push the Home button again.
From the Remote Settings menu, you can change the Volume, Rumble, and 
Connection settings, each of which functions as follows:
 
✓ Volume: By clicking on the onscreen + and – buttons or pressing the 
same buttons on the Wii Remote, you can respectively increase or 
decrease the sound coming from the Wii Remote’s speakers. Note that 
this setting remains the way you set it and applies to all Wii Remotes 
that will be connected to your system.
 
 You may find that for activities like the Free Run and Free Step Aerobic 
Exercises — both of which are explained in Chapter 5 — being able to 
adjust your Wii Remote’s speaker volume is essential.

20
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
✓ Rumble: This option determines whether the Wii Remote vibrates to 
certain onscreen or in-game options. Unless you are sensitive to 
vibrations, it is recommended that you leave this option enabled for 
Wii Fit Plus. Like Volume, the Rumble settings remain and apply to all Wii 
Remotes that connect to your system.
 
✓ Connection: This option disconnects Wii Remotes from your console 
without turning off the system.
Unlike the Wii Remote, the Nunchuk attachment is used only for Rhythm 
Boxing, which is explained in Chapter 5, and Rhythm Kung Fu, Rhythm 
Parade, and Big Top Juggling, which are explained in Chapter 6. You are 
prompted by Wii Fit Plus when to use the Nunchuk. Because the standard 
Nunchuk is not wireless, it needs to be plugged in to the bottom of your 
active Wii Remote, after which it will be automatically detected. Like the Wii 
Remote, the Nunchuk can be used in either hand for maximum comfort.
Navigating the Wii Fit Plus Menus
Wii Fit Plus is divided into three main navigation areas: Wii Fit Plaza, the 
Calendar screen, and the Training menu. A fourth area, the Wii Fit Plus 
Channel, can optionally be added to the Wii Menu. The following sections 
explore the options available in these areas.
Wii Fit Plaza
The Wii Fit Plaza is the starting point for your Wii Fit Plus training. After all the 
Miis you registered in Wii Fit Plus have finished running in, you see the Wii Fit 
Plaza, as shown in Figure 1-4. The Wii Fit Plaza has the following options:
 
✓ Wii Menu: Click the Wii icon at the upper left of the screen to return to 
the Wii Menu screen. You can also return to the Wii Menu screen any 
time by clicking the Home button on your Wii Remote.
 
✓ New Profile: Click the happy-face, plus-sign icon at the middle left of the 
screen to create a new user profile. This new user has to go through the 
setup process we describe earlier in this chapter. After registration, the 
new Mii appears in the Wii Fit Plaza, ready to be selected.
 
✓ Pet Stats: Click the animal icon in the lower left of the screen to register 
User Data for your pet. You enter your pet’s name, pet type (dog or cat), 
and characteristics. Although your pet will not be able to participate in the 
activities, your pet’s weight can be measured and tracked. In addition, your 
pet’s avatar appears during some of the activities to keep you company. 
Keep in mind that you can register only up to eight personal profiles, 
and this number includes your pets.

21
 Chapter 1: Getting Started
 
Figure 1-4:

 Creating a profile for someone 3 years old or younger has the same 
restrictions as registering a pet. Once the baby is older than 3, all 
measurements and activities will become available. Keep in mind that 
whether you’re holding a baby or pet, the Balance Board’s 330-pound 
maximum weight limit still applies.
 
✓ Settings: Click the wrench icon at the upper right of the screen to bring 
up a submenu with the following options:
 
• Install Channel: This option installs the Wii Fit Plus Channel on 
your Wii Menu, which allows you to check your weight, BMI, and 
overall Wii Fit Plus stats without having to insert the Wii Fit Plus 
disc into your system. This Channel is described in greater detail 
toward the end of this chapter.
 
• Wii Balance Board Check: You can use this option to verify 
if the four sensors on your Balance Board are functioning. If 
every sensor has a check mark, your Balance Board is working 
as it should. If not, visit www.support.nintendo.com or call 
Nintendo’s hotline at 1-800-255-3700 for assistance.
 
• Credits: Select the Wii Fit or Wii Fit Plus icon in the lower-right 
corner of the screen to see who helped make these titles possible. 
Pressing the B button at any time on your Wii Remote brings you 
back to the Settings menu.
 
✓ Trial: Clicking the question mark icon at the middle right of the screen 
starts up a trial version of Wii Fit Plus, which bypasses the standard 
Mii setup and registration procedure. After selecting one of six generic 
Miis, you can perform a basic Body Test or choose from a selection of 
15 training games. Because this is just a trial, weight and training data

Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
are not saved, so this is most useful for giving your friends and family a 
quick demonstration of what Wii Fit Plus is all about.
 
✓ Multiplayer: Click the multiplayer icon in the lower right of the screen 
to access this mode, which allows you to use one or more of the Miis 
stored on your Wii console to participate in the nine multiplayer activities. 
Each player takes turns playing a single round and using the Wii Remote 
and Balance Board. Stats tracked in this mode are kept separate from 
those in the main Wii Fit Plus game.
 
✓ Graph: This large area centered in the top half of your screen displays 
the daily BMI measurements for all the Miis currently registered on 
your system unless their profiles are password protected. Select the Fit 
Credits button to change to the daily bar graph view of how much time 
you’ve been spending with Wii Fit Plus each day. You can isolate the 
data on a single Mii by hovering your Wii Remote over that player. You 
can also click anywhere on the graph and drag the Wii Remote pointer 
right or left to see earlier or later dates, respectively.
 
✓ Miis: Click on a Mii and then select Begin to Advance to the Calendar 
screen, which is discussed in the next section.
Calendar
The Calendar screen, as shown in Figure 1-5, is the first screen you encounter 
after registering a new Mii or choosing a Mii from the Wii Fit Plaza. The Calendar 
screen is also the secondary gateway to daily training with Wii Fit Plus.

 Chapter 1: Getting Started
The options in this navigation area are as follows:
 
✓ Wii Fit Plaza: Clicking the return arrow icon at the upper left of the 
screen brings you back to the Wii Fit Plaza.
 
✓ Graph: Clicking the line graph icon at the lower left of the screen brings 
up a detailed chart of your Mii’s daily progress. Use the buttons on the 
top row to toggle the graph’s display between BMI, Weight, Wii Fit Age, 
Fit Credits, Waist, and Steps. Hover over a point on the graph with the 
Wii Remote to view a specific value for that day.
 
 Waist and Steps measurements are entered manually. To measure 
your waist, bend at your side. The crease that forms indicates your 
natural waistline, which should be directly above your belly button 
and below your rib cage. Wrap a soft tape measure around your waist, 
directly on your skin. Exhale gently as you pull the tape so it remains 
taut against your body, but does not squeeze your skin. Your waist 
measurement is the number that meets the starting point of the tape. As 
for steps, you can measure these by using a pedometer. Some suggestions 
on what to look for in a pedometer are presented in Chapter 13.
 
 You can click on the onscreen + and – buttons or press the same buttons 
on the Wii Remote to change the vertical and horizontal date range 
displayed on the graph. To scroll, click and drag the Wii Remote pointer 
anywhere on the graph. You can scroll farther by letting go of A and 
pressing it again. Click the Back button or press B on your Wii Remote to 
return to the Calendar screen.
 
✓ My Wii Fit Plus: A floating orange door appears in the lower left of your 
Calendar screen after the first time you access My Wii Fit Plus from the 
Training menu. This door is your instant portal to My Wii Fit Plus, saving 
you from having to take the long route via the Training menu to access 
this option.
 
✓ User Settings: Click the happy-face, word-balloon icon at the upper right 
of the screen to pull up a submenu with the following options:
 
• Edit Profile: Edit your Mii’s height, date of birth, and password. 
Click an option, then use the onscreen arrows or + and – buttons 
on the Wii Remote to edit the information. Click OK when finished 
or press the B button on the Wii Remote to back out.
 
• Change Design: This option allows you to change your calendar 
color and choose a new design for your calendar stamp. The more 
you play Wii Fit Plus, the more stamps you unlock, up to a total of 
eight.
 
• Save Time: If you find that you consistently work out late at night 
and prefer your data recorded on a particular day, you can use this 
option to tell Wii Fit Plus to begin a new day at 3:00 a.m. instead of 
12:00 a.m.

24
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
• Delete User Data: This ominous sounding option does exactly 
what it says, deletes all the stored data for your current Mii. If you 
choose Yes from the confirmation screen, all your measurements 
and hard work will be gone forever.
 
✓ Calendar: The calendar smack dab in the middle of the screen shows 
a stamp for every day you’ve performed a Body Test for the currently 
selected month. Click a stamped day to see the results of your BMI and 
Center of Balance tests for that particular day. Click the onscreen + and 
– buttons or press the same buttons on the Wii Remote to scroll through 
the months.
 
✓ Body Test: This option allows you to perform the Body Test for the 
day, as described earlier in this chapter. If you perform more than one 
Body Test in a day, the newest results will replace the previous results, 
provided you elect to save the more recent results. Because your body 
fluctuates throughout the day, you will often get different results. Try to 
do a Body Test only once each day and at roughly the same time each 
day for the most consistent results.
 
✓ Training: Opening this menu allows you to access the exercises you 
bought Wii Fit Plus for in the first place. We cover this in the next 
section.
Training menu
If you’re going to become fitter, you have to train for it, and that’s where 
the aptly named Training menu comes in. The Training menu, shown in 
Figure 1-6, includes Training Plus, Yoga, Strength Training, Aerobics, Balance 
Games, and My Wii Fit Plus options. It is also where your Fit Bank resides, 
which we describe in greater detail a little later on.
 
Notice the virtual Balance Board in the background trying to get your attention? 
You can click on it to go to the Ultimate Balance Test or Scale Challenge, 
which are described in Chapter 2.
From the Training menu, click any of the options on the right-hand side 
to bring up the applicable training submenu. For information on Yoga and 
Strength Training, refer to Chapter 3; My Wii Fit Plus, Chapter 4; Aerobics, 
Chapter 5; and Training Plus and Balance Games, Chapter 6.
What follows are some general navigation tips:
 
✓ Hover over an icon in a Training submenu to see the name of the exercise 
and how many times it’s been attempted with your Mii. Unlike the 
original Wii Fit, all exercises are available to you from the outset, except 
for the three Strength Training Challenges, which are grayed out and will 
have to be unlocked.

✓ Click the + and – buttons at the top of the screen or press the same 
buttons on the Wii Remote in a Training submenu to go directly to the 
other training submenus.
 
✓ Click the Back button in the lower-left corner of a Training submenu or 
press the B button on your Wii Remote to go back to the Training menu.
 
✓ Click the Switch Trainer icon to toggle between the male and female 
trainer in the Yoga and Strength submenu.
 
✓ In the Yoga and Strength Training submenu, after you select an exercise, 
you can click Demo to watch a trainer explain how to do the chosen 
movement. Click the Skip button at any time to jump to a screen that 
allows you to get a more detailed view of the trainer performing the 
exercise. From this screen, you can rotate your viewpoint around the 
trainer by pressing A and moving the Wii Remote pointer around the 
screen. The 1 and 2 buttons on the Wii Remote allow you to zoom in 
and out, respectively. Click the Pause button on the screen to stop a 
trainer’s movement and study its position, or click Restart to have the 
demonstration begin again. After you are ready to begin the activity, 
click the Start Workout button on the lower right of the screen. When 
you’re performing an exercise, press up or down on the directional pad 
on your Wii Remote to change the camera angle focused on the trainer 
between front and rear to personalize your view.
 
✓ Switch between players by clicking the Switch! button on the bottom 
right of the screen in the Training Plus, Aerobics, and Balance Games 
submenus. You can select from any of the players on your system, 
including unregistered users, but these players won’t build up Fit 
Credits, which we discuss shortly.

26
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
At any time during training, you can click the + button on your Wii Remote to 
bring up the Pause menu, which will give you the option to Continue, Retry, or 
Quit. Continue resumes the current activity, Retry restarts the current activity, 
and Quit brings you back to the Training menu. Keep in mind that if you Quit, 
you won’t get any Fit Credits for the current activity. So, let’s go over those Fit 
Credits.
Fit Credits and Fit Bank
Notice that cute little piggy bank with the display on the left of the Training 
menu? This is your Fit Bank or Fit Piggy, as it is often referred to in the game. 
When you engage in Wii Fit Plus activities, you are rewarded with Fit Credits, 
which get deposited into this Fit Bank. The number of Fit Credits earned 
varies based on how much time you spend performing an activity. Although 
the Fit Bank only keeps track of your daily earnings, you can see your 
cumulative counts by going to the Calendar screen, pressing the graph icon, 
and selecting Fit Credits; the Calendar screen is discussed in detail earlier 
in this chapter. As you accumulate Fit Credits, more advanced activities 
become unlocked, providing great motivation to stick with the program.
Besides storing your Fit Credits and looking cute, your Fit Bank serves 
another important purpose. After you complete an activity, the estimated 
number of calories used during that exercise will be presented to you and 
displayed on your Fit Bank, a feature that was lacking in the original Wii Fit.
If you are wondering how these calorie calculations are made, the Wii Fit Plus 
software uses a METs calculator. A MET, or metabolic equivalent of task, 
represents the intensity of an activity. For example, it takes 1 MET to sit still, 
which is considered your resting metabolic rate. Super Hula Hoop in Wii 
Fit Plus has a worth of 4 METs, which would be equivalent to a light walk or 
round of golf on foot. If you know the MET value of an activity, you can 
calculate the number of calories burned while performing that activity by 
using the following equation:
METs × Your Weight × Time (hours) × 0.48 = Calories Burned.
Keep in mind that all values for calories burned are estimates. The actual 
number of calories burned may be different due to factors such as your 
metabolic rate and efficiency of movement. Regardless, this caloric measure 
is a good way to get a sense of how much you may or may not be pushing 
yourself during your workout.

 Chapter 1: Getting Started
Wii Fit Plus Channel
You can check your profiles and Wii Fit Plus stats, and perform the Body Test 
without having to insert the game disc into your system by simply installing 
the Wii Fit Plus Channel. Do this at the Wii Fit Plaza, where you click on the 
Settings wrench icon at the upper right of the screen to bring up a submenu, 
then click on the Install Channel option. Click OK at the confirmation screen 
to install the Wii Fit Plus Channel on the Wii Menu. Click OK after the Save to 
the Wii System Memory prompt appears. After it’s installed, click OK when 
you see Finished Saving. The next time you access the Wii Menu, you will see 
the new channel, as shown in Figure 1-7.
 
The Wii Fit Plus Channel takes up 109 blocks on your Wii’s internal memory, 
so you need to ensure that you have sufficient space for a successful 
installation. Refer to the Wii Operations Manual that came with your console 
or Wii For Dummies by Kyle Orland (Wiley Publishing) for more on memory 
management.

Warming Up and Cooling Down
Before you start doing any of the activities in Wii Fit Plus, the program 
reminds you to warm up; however, no warm-up activities are provided 
outside of Warm Up, found under the Lifestyle category of Wii Fit Plus 
Routines, which is described in Chapter 4. As a general rule, before beginning 
any type of physical activity, it is important to elevate your body temperature 
and get the muscle groups you’ll be targeting moving. Contrary to popular 
belief, stretching is not recommended as part of your warm-up because 
stretching cold muscles can cause pulls and tears, potentially leading to 
serious injury. If you wish to stretch, do so at the end of your workout when 
your body has been put through its paces and is already warm, and be sure 
to stretch only within your limits.
The best way to warm up is with light aerobic exercise — just enough to 
break a sweat and test how your body is responding. This can include 
activities like jogging in place, jumping rope, or performing jumping jacks. 
If you’ll be performing strength-based movements, it’s a good idea to also 
warm up the general areas you’ll be working, such as with push-ups for upper 
body or bodyweight squats for lower body. Whatever you do, keep the 
activities low impact and low stress. Generally speaking, a good warm-up 
should approximate the activity or activities you’ll be performing and last 
only five to ten minutes, but feel free to adjust as needed to sufficiently 
elevate your body’s temperature.

W
hen following an exercise regime, determining your baseline physical 
fitness level and recording your progress may prove both challenging 
and time-consuming. This is likely the reason why many people don’t bother 
to keep a fitness log. Yet, a record can be invaluable in identifying trends and 
assessing your overall progress. Fortunately, Wii Fit Plus makes the process 
simple. You can perform a series of tests, and Wii Fit Plus saves this information, 
which it then plots out for you in graphs for future reference. This format 
is certainly easier than reading chicken scratch on paper and it saves a few 
trees in the process. You can even record physical activities outside of the 
Wii Fit Plus program.
This chapter provides an overview of your center of balance and the 
Wii Fit Plus Balance and Mind and Body Tests that are used to assess it and 
your Wii Fit Age. We also explain your Body Mass Index (BMI) and weight 
assessments, review how to mark your results, and go about setting realistic 
goals. Guidance on navigating the many charts that track your progress is 
also provided.

Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
Finding Your Center of Balance
Your center of balance, more commonly referred to as your center of 
gravity, is the point between the left and right sides of your body in which 
your body mass (weight) is considered to concentrate and through which 
gravity is enacting its constant downward force. It is this point that is working 
hard to keep you balanced. For most people, this point lies at roughly the 
level of the second sacral vertebra (S2), which is located in the lower part of 
the back just above the coccyx (tailbone) when standing upright, but it can 
vary based on your age, sex, build, posture, and whether you are supporting 
any external weight, such as a purse or shopping bag. It will also change 
depending on the position of your body and your movements. For example, 
your center of balance is lower when you bend your knees to perform the 
Rowing Squat under the Strength Training exercises and higher when you 
raise your arms to do the Half-Moon pose under the Yoga exercises (both 
of these are outlined in Chapter 3). The Balance Board has four Balance 
Sensors, which it uses to find and track your center of balance during most 
Wii Fit Plus activities; some activities just use the Wii Remote. Using the 
Remote allows you to make adjustments during the exercises, ensuring 
proper form and potentially helping you to improve your posture, which will 
prevent unnatural strain on your muscles, joints, and ligaments. To see if 
your posture and balance are improving, you can check your center of 
balance any time by taking the Body Test.
Body Test
The Body Test can be accessed by clicking Body Test on the lower left of the 
Calendar screen. This test has several components, including the Center of 
Balance Test, BMI, and the Mind and Body Control Tests. The Mind Tests are 
new to Wii Fit Plus, so unlike the original Wii Fit, your mental capabilities can 
also factor into your Wii Fit Age. If you are using Wii Fit Plus for the first time, 
you have to do all three to establish a baseline, as outlined in Chapter 1. On 
subsequent use, you can elect to do none; just the Center of Balance Test and 
BMI/weight assessment; or a complete assessment, including the Center of 
Balance Test, BMI/weight, and two of the Mind and Body Control Tests, both 
of which will be chosen for you at random.
 
If you want to establish your center of balance and BMI in under one minute, 
you can do so with the Simple Test, which appears in the Wii Fit Plaza after 
you select your Mii.

31
 Chapter 2: Understanding Your Baseline
If you choose to do a complete assessment, your results will be used to 
determine your Wii Fit Age. The Body Test begins by prompting you to enter 
the weight of your clothes. You can choose Light (–2 lbs.), Heavy (–4 lbs.), or 
Other, which allows you to input a specific weight (up to ±7 lbs.) by pressing 
up and down on the directional pad on the Wii Remote. You can even input 0 
if you are in the mood to exercise in the nude — hey, we aren’t going to judge 
you! Inputting a weight for your clothes ensures you receive a more accurate 
measure of your bodyweight and BMI, provided you are good at estimating or 
like to weigh your clothes before you put them on in the morning. All silliness 
aside, if you are wearing a T-shirt and shorts, generally picking Light will 
suffice. If you are wearing sweats, selecting Heavy works better.
 
You can hone your ability to estimate weight by engaging in the Scale 
Challenge, which you can access after you click on the virtual Balance Board 
that hangs out in the Training Menu. Disguised as a mental challenge, this 
frantic and fun mini game has you placing objects on the Balance Board that 
equal the amount of weight given as closely and quickly as possible. After you 
are satisfied with your estimation, press A. Wii Fit Plus provides feedback on 
the level of your accuracy. You have 30 seconds to complete five rounds.
Center of Balance Test
When the game prompts you, stand on the Balance Board with your body 
straight and your feet spread equally apart with your toes slightly pointed out.
Relax your shoulders and hold still — think mime or statue. Following a 
three-second countdown, your balance on the left, right, front, and back of 
your body will be measured by the four Balance Board sensors.
If you fidget too much, the test will end prematurely and you will have to step 
off the Balance Board and start again. After the measuring is complete, which 
takes just a few seconds, your results are shown on the onscreen Balance 
Board by a red dot that traces a line showing the shifts that were detected 
in your center of balance. The Wii Fit Plus software will then mark a red dot 
where your average center of balance is located and provide you with a 
percentage measure for your right and left sides, as shown in Figure 2-1.
To mix things up, Wii Fit Plus occasionally asks you to close your eyes during 
the Center of Balance Test. If you can’t help but sneak a peek, you will 
discover that the screen has turned black. If your balance is found to be 
way off — eyes open or shut — Wii Fit Plus administers a second test that is 

32
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
intended to make you more aware of your center of balance. Your current 
center of balance appears as a red dot on the onscreen Balance Board. The 
goal is to shift your weight accordingly so that you move the red dot into the 
blue circle in the center of the onscreen Balance Board and hold it there for 
three seconds.
 
If you find that the results of your Center of Balance Test fluctuate widely, 
this may have to do with your foot placement on the Balance Board. Make 
sure your left and right feet match; for example, one foot shouldn’t be straight 
while the other is pointing out. You can use the contours on the Balance 
Board as a guide.
 
Figure 2-1:

showing 
the results 
of a Center

test.
 
Body Mass Index (BMI)
During the Center of Balance Test, Wii Fit Plus also measures your weight 
and calculates your BMI, which it now shares with you. Figure 2-2 provides 
a glimpse of the BMI results screen. The Weight screen can be accessed by 
clicking on Weight at the bottom of the BMI screen.
Although Wii Fit Plus places a lot of emphasis on BMI, the Wii Fit Plus 
Instruction Booklet does point out three limitations.
 
✓ BMI is typically used as a measure of health in adults, so when BMI 
results are provided for a player between 3 and 19 years of age, it may 
not be as accurate, even though Wii Fit Plus was designed to allow BMI 
assessment in this age group. To ensure accuracy of this measure in 
children and teens, who may experience some serious growth spurts, 
it is important to keep their height information up-to-date. This can be 

33
 Chapter 2: Understanding Your Baseline
done by clicking on the happy-face, word-balloon icon in the Calendar 
screen, selecting Edit Profile, and then clicking on the listed height and 
making the adjustment. Be sure to choose Save when you are done.
 
✓ BMI can’t distinguish between muscle and fat, so if you are more muscular, 
your BMI may end up in the Overweight or even Obese range, and Wii 
Fit Plus will inflate your Mii to become heftier. Unfortunately, Wii Fit Plus 
has no means of accounting for muscle, so you’ll just have to deal with a 
potentially untrue visual assessment. What’s the big deal anyway, right? 
You know what you look like, and it isn’t like Miis can be muscular or 
shapely anyway.
 
✓ BMI is not the only measure of health that counts. Your cholesterol 
levels (high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides), 
blood pressure, blood sugar levels, heart rate, and numerous other 
factors are equally important, and these levels are affected by many 
factors, only one of which is weight or your BMI. So, even if you have a 
BMI of 22, which is considered to be the healthiest (people with this BMI 
are statistically less likely to get sick according to Wii Fit Plus), don’t 
let that lull you into a false sense of security. Only a complete physical 
examination by a qualified physician can guarantee a completely clean 
bill of health.
So, why even bother with BMI? Despite its limitations, BMI is a reliable indicator 
of body fat for most people and is a simple tool that can be used to screen for 
weight categories that have a higher risk of health problems. Until there is a 
console that comes with a blood pressure cuff attachment and that can screen 
your blood — though we are not sure how much fun that would be — BMI will 
have to do. Certainly, you know your health better than anyone else and are 
the best judge of how meaningful your Wii Fit Plus BMI measure truly is.

Controlling Your Body
To assess how adept you are at controlling your body, Wii Fit Plus has ten 
Mind and Body Control Tests that challenge your balancing abilities and 
assess your mental prowess. When you initially play Wii Fit Plus, you are just 
given the Basic Balance test, but on subsequent testing, two tests are chosen 
for you at random, some of which are more easily performed than others. 
Regardless, the information gleaned from these tests may help you ascertain 
whether you are favoring one side of your body over the other and how well 
your brain and body react to visual data and stimuli. The ten Mind and Body 
Control Tests, plus bonus, are as follows:
 
✓ Agility Test: Do you have the ability to shift your center of balance 
quickly and precisely? Find out with this test, which requires you to 
shift your weight in all directions on the Balance Board — front, back, 
left, and right — in a very controlled fashion to hit the blue boxes with 
the red dot that represents your center of balance, as demonstrated in 
Figure 2-3. You have 30 seconds to hit as many boxes as possible. This 
test becomes progressively more difficult; initially, there are several 
rounds with single boxes, followed by multiple boxes, and, ultimately, 
moving boxes.
 
Be sure to move your upper body forward and backward for this activity as 
well, as front and back shifts in balance (the sagittal plane of motion) are also 
required to get those boxes. Although it may be tempting to randomly move 
in any and every direction, use controlled movements to sharpen your 
proprioceptive sense, which is the unconscious awareness of the space that 
your body occupies. These exercises are especially good if you are accident 
prone like one of the authors of this book.

Test in

 Chapter 2: Understanding Your Baseline
 
✓ Basic Balance Test: Want to see how good you are at shifting your 
weight between the left and right sides of your body? If so, this test can 
provide some much-needed answers. The two onscreen vertical bars 
represent your left and right sides. As you shift your weight, the bars 
become filled in red, depending on how much pressure is being applied. 
Thus, if most of your weight is being put on your left side, the left vertical 
bar will be almost completely filled, whereas the bar on the right 
will be almost empty, as shown in Figure 2-4. You will also see blue 
rectangular areas on each of the vertical bars. The goal is to shift your 
weight so that each bar gets filled enough to reach the blue rectangular 
area, which turns yellow when you reach it, and then to hold that 
position for three seconds, at which point those elusive blue rectangles 
will change positions. You have five rounds to master.
 
Figure 2-4: 
The Basic 
Balance 
Test.
 
 
✓ Dual Balance Test: Are you adept at shifting your balance while also 
adjusting the position of your arms? You can find out with this activity, 
which is the Basic Balance Test with a twist. For this activity, you hold 
the Wii Remote with both hands out in front of you and follow the 
instructions for the Basic Balance Test, as previously outlined, while 
also adjusting the position of your Wii Remote so that it lines up with 
the blue bar that appears in the onscreen circle that represents your 
Wii Remote. This circle appears in the center of the screen between the 
vertical bars. After you successfully shift your balance and line up the 
Wii Remote, all blue bars turn yellow. You now have to hold steady for 
three seconds, after which you progress to the next round. You have 30 
seconds to complete five rounds.

36
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
This test is one of the more challenging Mind and Body Tests. If you find you 
are having a tough time coordinating all movements, try to adjust your center 
of balance on the Balance Board first and then adjust your Wii Remote to 
match the position of the blue bar that appears in the onscreen circle that 
represents your Wii Remote.
 
✓ Judgment Test: Are you able to quickly process information and react 
appropriately? See how well your brain and body collaborate with this 
virtual twist on Simon Says, where you need to move your body to select 
numbers that are either less than or greater than a number designated 
by Wii Fit Plus. To start the test, you have to shift your center of balance 
so that the red dot appears in the blue circle on the center of the screen. 
A number in a green bubble appears onscreen. For example, if the 
number needs to be less than five, shift your center of balance to select 
it, as shown in Figure 2-5. If not, stay as still as a mouse. For the next 
number to appear, the red dot needs to move to the blue circle. See if 
you can get all 20 correct.
 
Figure 2-5: 
The 
Judgment 
Test.
 
 
✓ Memory Test: Do you have the memory of an elephant? Find out with 
this test, which gives you 25 chances to compare the number in the 
center with the number to the right. If the number to the right is greater 
than the center number, you have to crush the center number by 
squatting to bring down the press that appears above it. If you don’t 
want to crush that number, stay still or that press is going to come 
down. Initially, all of the numbers are visible, but eventually they will be 
covered up and you will have to recall what the numbers were.

37
 Chapter 2: Understanding Your Baseline
 
✓ Peripheral Vision Test: How keen is your peripheral vision? Find out 
with this test, which is one of the more challenging Body Tests. The 
test starts by having you center your balance by adjusting your body 
so that the red dot appears in the middle blue circle. After you hold this 
position for three seconds, numbers will appear onscreen. You have to 
click on them in ascending order, from 1 to 10, while keeping the red 
dot in the blue circle. After you move the Wii Remote so that the cursor 
appears on top of the desired number, press A. Be sure not to move on 
the Balance Board. If the red dot migrates outside the blue circle, the 
numbers vanish and you will have to center yourself again on the board 
before the numbers will reappear.
 
If you have trouble with this test, you can hone your skills by doing Basic Run 
Plus, which requires you to use your peripheral vision. Basic Run Plus is found 
under Training Plus and is described in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Prediction Test: Are you able to predict obstacles that lie ahead of you? 
This 60-second test, which is reminiscent of Balance Bubble and Balance 
Bubble Plus (both are described in Chapter 6), requires you to shift your 
center of balance to the right or left to avoid hitting the walls and other 
obstacles, some of which are mobile. To complete the test, you have to 
look ahead and predict where the mobile obstacles are going to be when 
you reach them to avoid a collision. If an impact ensues, it’s game over.
 
You can hone your prediction skills by training with Obstacle Course, Balance 
Bubble Plus, and Balance Bubble. The former two appear in Training Plus and 
the latter under Balance Games. Turn to Chapter 6 to find out more about 
these activities.
 
✓ Single Leg Balance Test: Can you stand on one leg for 30 seconds? 
Sounds simple doesn’t it? After you select which leg you’d like to stand 
on, place it on the line in the middle of the Balance Board, lift your 
other leg off the Balance Board (you can rest it against the standing leg, 
if desired), and press A. The testing will now commence. You see an 
onscreen graph with two thin vertical borders, as shown in Figure 2-6. 
As you balance yourself, your frontal plane of motion (side-to-side 
balance) is illustrated by a red line that stems from a triangle (this 
represents your foot) resting on a horizontal red line (this represents 
the Balance Board) with a thin blue vertical line through the middle of 
it that extends from the top to the bottom of the graph (this represents 
the line through the middle of your Balance Board). The left and right 
sides are indicated on each side of the graph, and percentages for how 
much of your weight is distributed on both sides of your foot are provided. 
As the test progresses, those thin vertical borders become more 
prominent, allowing less wiggle room — if you go into the blue, it’s 
game over.

If you are concerned about your stability, you can use an object or spotter for 
support. Just be sure to keep practicing so that you can eventually shed these 
aides.

✓ Stillness Test: Can you remain as still as the Royal Guards who 
protect Buckingham Palace? Find out with this 30-second test (called the 
Steadiness Test in the original Wii Fit), which requires you to hold as still 
as possible — no fidgeting. That’s it! Easy, right? Like an annoying tourist, 
Wii Fit Plus tries to distract you. A red dot designating your center of 
balance appears onscreen in a black and white grid, and after ten seconds, 
the grid starts to move. Don’t follow it. Just keep your stance. In ten sec-
onds, the dot and grid completely vanish. Keep holding still, because it 
isn’t game over yet. After another ten seconds pass, testing is complete 
and your movements are revealed. Are you Guard material?
 
✓ Walking Test: Is there a spring in your step or is your gait off-kilter? This 
test reveals how well you are able to distribute your weight as you walk. 
Wii Fit Plus instructs you to stand with your feet spread equally apart and 
then walk in place for 20 steps; try to avoid any unnatural, exaggerated 
movements. Make sure to keep your feet in the textured squared-off 
sections of the Balance Board; otherwise you will look like a waddling duck 
and your steps may not register. The meter at the top of the screen counts 
your steps, and the onscreen foot that corresponds with the side being 
stepped on will turn red, enlarge, and have blue rings emanating from it as 
you take each step. That sounds ominous, doesn’t it? Don’t worry; your real 
feet won’t take a beating with this activity. At the end, your balance for 
each side will be provided as a percentage. You also receive a percentage 
for your overall balance, and if you completed the activity before, the 
previously attained value will be provided as a point of reference.

39
 Chapter 2: Understanding Your Baseline
 
The faster you go, the better your result will be; however, if you want a more 
accurate assessment of your balance while walking, a normal pace is the way 
to go.
 
✓ Ultimate Balance Test: This test is not a randomly generated test, but 
it fits in very well here. After you are all set up, you can access this 
test anytime from the Training Menu. Just click on the animated virtual 
Balance Board in the background; it may be throwing punches or jogging 
on one of the treadmills. After you click on it, you are asked: Would you 
like to take the Ultimate Balance Test? Once you click Yes, you will find 
that this activity is reminiscent of the Basic Balance Test, except that 
you now have to distribute your weight evenly. Although the blue bars 
are always aligned at the center (50 percent mark), they are now much 
thinner and will proceed to get even thinner as the test progresses 
through all three rounds. You have 60 seconds to get through the 
activity, and for each round, you have to stay within the blue area for 
three seconds. See if you can make it through. After you do, you can 
try to beat your time to get a new record. You have to hold your stance 
50-50 for 60 demanding seconds to be considered a Master of Balance.
 
After you perform a Mind and Body Test, that test will become available for 
you to practice anytime by going to the My Wii Fit Plus Menu and clicking on 
the virtual Balance Board cavorting in the background.
Determining Your Wii Fit Age
After you complete the randomly selected Body Tests, Wii Fit Plus presents 
you with your Wii Fit Age, which drops down on the screen as a giant number 
after a suspenseful drum roll. Whether you and your Mii are left feeling elated 
or disappointed after all that flourish, you can’t put too much stock in the 
number. Although the calculation takes your actual age into consideration, 
it is based predominantly on your performance on the Body Tests, and not 
even your BMI or weight are factored in.
Although the Wii Fit Plus instruction booklet suggests that your fitness goals 
can include lowering your Wii Fit Age, this is not an appropriate goal because 
your Wii Fit Age can fluctuate widely, even on the same day. Some Body Tests 
are easier than others, and until you master each of them, there may be vast 
differences in your Wii Fit Age, depending on which combination you get. So, 
although your Wii Fit Age is truly but a number, and is about as relevant an 
indicator of your health as a crystal ball is for telling your future, it sure can 
provide a laugh or two, and that is always good for your health.

Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
Marking Your Results
After you complete a Body Test, be sure to record the result by stamping 
your calendar before you shut off the system or start training. Just point 
the Wii Remote at the highlighted date on the Calendar screen and press A. 
Initially, the only available stamp is that of an orange foot; however, as you 
continue taking Body Tests, seven more stamps will become available to you. 
What follows is how many Body Tests you need to take to unlock the stamps:
 
✓ OK: 2
 
✓ Star: 5
 
✓ Heart: 7
 
✓ Flower: 10
 
✓ Smiley Face: 14
 
✓ Clover: 22
 
✓ Mii: 30
To access these stamps, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the smiling face icon at the upper right of the screen.
 
2. Select Change Design, and then hover over the stamp design 
you want.
 
3. Click A and then click OK.
You can also unlock seven additional stamps for your pets. Initially, an 
orange paw print will be available.
 
If you want to use a new stamp design, be sure to change it before the Body 
Test. Even though you can retake the Mind and Body tests and update your 
results, you can’t change the stamp on your calendar after it’s been marked.
Setting Goals
Wii Fit Plus allows you to set weight-loss or weight-gain goals. After you set 
your goal, you are locked in for one week, unless you reach that goal earlier 
or want to create a new Mii or delete your user data. You can undertake the 
last option by clicking on the happy-face, word-balloon icon on the top right 
of the Calendar screen and then selecting Delete User Data. However, after 
you delete it, all of your data is gone forever.

41
 Chapter 2: Understanding Your Baseline
Statistically, people with a BMI of 22 are said to be the least likely to get sick, 
and if your BMI is over 25, you may have increased health risks; however, as 
discussed earlier, BMI has considerable limitations. Don’t obsess over a BMI 
goal — try to keep your weight-loss goals to one to two pounds per week. 
Your doctor can provide the best guidance, as he or she will be able to take 
your medical history into account.
Also, try to keep your goals realistic. We suggest setting smaller goals, as 
this will enhance motivation and effort. If you feel you’re able to constantly 
improve, you’re more likely to stick with your exercise program and be more 
enthusiastic about it. Bigger goals can feel overwhelming and unattainable, 
which may increase the chance that you’ll throw in the towel before you’ve 
realized your full potential. Furthermore, accomplishing several smaller goals 
adds up to that big goal faster than you think.
 
If you start to build muscle, you may find your weight going up. This is 
because muscle weighs more than fat, and this should not be considered a 
bad thing. What matters most is how you feel. It truly is not all about the 
numbers, so don’t be disheartened if you don’t reach the goal you’ve set. It’s 
the progress that counts, even if it’s one more repetition on an exercise or 
being able to hold a yoga position for a few seconds longer.
Assessing and Comparing Your Results
To review changes in your BMI, weight, Wii Fit Age, Fit Credits, Waist, and 
Steps, click on the graph icon on the lower left of the Calendar screen, which 
pulls up a graph with tabs for each of these categories, as shown in Figure 
2-7. Click on the desired tab to review your results. You can scroll through 
any of these graphs by pointing at the graph, pressing and holding the A 
button, and then moving your Wii Remote in the direction you want to scroll. 
You can also change the time point displayed for any of these graphs by 
clicking – or + in the Graph Display Area, which is located to the right directly 
below the calendar and to the left of your Mii.
The following list examines each of these tabs in greater detail.
 
✓ BMI: Initially, the horizontal axis lists the days of the current month and 
the vertical axis lists BMI. A triangular point shows your goal. The dates 
that Body Tests were taken are plotted out in a line graph, allowing 
you to see how close you are to reaching your goal and whether you’ve 
made any progress. If you hover over the points, the date and your BMI 
pop up in a black bubble. Clicking the + in the Graph Display Area allows 
you to assess the results between different points in time, including 1 
week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year. The results for 3 months 

42
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
and 1 year are provided as a scatter plot, which allows you to easily 
observe trends. Did your BMI go up in December? Maybe you got carried 
away eating too much delicious holiday fare and can make a mental note 
not to let that happen again.
 
✓ Weight: This chart is plotted the same way as BMI, except that the 
vertical axis now lists weights. Depending on what your goal is relative 
to your weight, you may not see the point indicating your goal on the 
graph, unless you click the + in the Graph Display Area and pick another 
vantage point, such as 2 weeks or 3 months. As with BMI, the scatter 
plot views provide a good overview of trends in your weight, allowing 
you to identify potential weight busters, such as the ice cream shop 
that opened for the season next to where you work that you started 
frequenting in April.
 
✓ Wii Fit Age: Because your Wii Fit Age may vary greatly (see Determining 
Your Wii Fit Age, earlier in this chapter), this measure may best be 
observed as a scatter plot by selecting the 3-month or 1-year view from 
the Graph Display Area. Although not a very relevant measure of your 
progress or fitness level, it may be interesting to compare your highs 
and lows.
 
✓ Fit Credits: When you pull up this graph, you see dates on the horizontal 
axis, units of time in minutes on the vertical axis, and a color-coded 
key for each category of activity available on Wii Fit Plus. Notice that 
these colors correspond to those on the Training Menu; however, an 
additional category at the very top of this key, called Activity Log, has a 
corresponding button to the right of the key. If you record any exercises 
or activities done outside of Wii Fit Plus to the Activity Log, these are 
also tracked here as a bar graph; you can track activities for babies and 
pets as well. If multiple activities are performed on a given day, the bar 
will be divided into color segments of varying size to indicate the 
activities performed and how long they were performed. From the Graph 
Display Area, you can pick 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month. The 1-month 
setting is the easiest to scroll through, but the bars become quite small 
and may be hard to read.
 
✓ Waist: This measure is not automatically recorded by Wii Fit Plus, and 
any waist measurement must be manually entered. You can do this by 
clicking Waist and then Record. All waist measurements are entered in 
inches. For tips on measuring your waist, turn to Chapter 1. Wii Fit Plus 
allows you to track waist measurements for babies and pets as well.
 
✓ Steps: As with waist measurements, Steps are manually recorded. The 
ability to log your steps in Wii Fit Plus is useful if you use a pedometer. If 
you are considering purchasing one, turn to Chapter 13 for guidance on 
what to look for. If you already own a pedometer, strive for 10,000 steps 
a day — a common fitness goal. Wii Fit Plus allows you to keep track 
of steps for babies and pets as well. We aren’t sure why you’d want to 
track baby steps, but if your dog or cat is in serious need of a diet, this 
feature may be useful. You can purchase pet pedometers at select 
retailers.

Although the Fit Credits graph shows how much time you are investing in 
each type of Wii Fit Plus activity, it won’t help you ascertain whether your 
performance on individual exercises is improving. Although the star ranking 
you receive after completing an exercise serves as a good indicator, as you 
will also see previous records and results, the best indicator is the ease with 
which you are able to perform an exercise. So, if at first your legs turned to 
jelly after squeezing out five Rowing Squats, but after some work you are able 
to do ten with relative ease, you’ve made a lot of progress!

Activity Log
To add an activity to the Activity Log, press 
the Activity Log button. Press A when you see 
“You can record exercises and activities done 
outside Wii Fit Plus in your Activity Log,” and 
then click on Yes when you see “Do you want 
to record an activity in your Activity Log?” You 
will then have to select an activity type, Light, 
Normal, or Hard. If you are unsure how your 
activity ranks, you can click on Examples for 
each of these to get an idea. After you make 
your selection, just click on the up and down 
arrows for hours and minutes as desired and 
press OK. You will then receive a summary 
of what was added, followed by the question 
“Would you like to add another activity?” Pick 
Yes or No, depending on what you’d like to do.

Locking and Unlocking Your Results
The Wii Fit Plaza has a graph that displays your BMI and that of all the Miis 
you have registered on your system, offering a point of comparison with 
other players. You can also access everyone’s Fit Credits — that is, unless 
you want to hide your results and keep anyone else from accessing or playing 
as your Mii. Here is how:
 
1. Click the happy-face, word-balloon icon at the top right of the 
Calendar screen, select Edit Profile, and click the None button next to 
Password.
 
 Wii Fit Plus now asks you to set a password. Just click Yes.
 
2. After you set your 4-digit password, click OK.
 
3. Reenter the password for verification and click OK.
 
 You are notified that your password has been set.
 
4. After you click A, you return to your profile and see four asterisks 
next to Password.
 
5. Click Save and your profile is now secure.
 
 You can just click Back until you get to the Calendar screen.
Should you have a change of heart and want to undo the password, click the 
happy-face, word-balloon icon at the Calendar screen, choose Edit Profile, 
and click on the asterisks next to Password. A Change Password? prompt 
appears. Click Remove and then Yes when you see “Remove password.” After 
you click Save, you are password-free.
Although you should select a password you will remember, such as a PIN 
or the last four digits of your Social Security number, there is no need to 
fret if you forget. Just keep entering the possibilities, and after four or five 
attempts, Wii Fit Plus will ask if you are really the person whose Mii you are 
trying to access. Assuming you are, click A. You will now be given a security 
question, such as “What is your height?” If you answer correctly, your Mii will 
become accessible, and you can go into the User Settings and change your 
password or remove it altogether. Of course, if the people you are trying to 
hide your information from also know very basic facts about you, such as 
height and date of birth, they can just as easily unlock your Mii, regardless 
of what your password is. Although a password may keep some prying eyes 
away, you are not guaranteed that your information will remain private.

Getting Fit with Yoga and 
Strength Training
In This Chapter
▶ Getting started with yoga and strength training
▶ Understanding yoga
▶ Mastering the yoga poses
▶ Working your body with strength training
I
t may seem unusual for us to cover yoga and strength training in the same 
chapter, but we have two reasons for doing so. The exercises we highlight 
in this chapter are what make Wii Fit Plus the excellent fitness software that 
it is, and yoga and strength training actually have a lot in common, with both 
activities helping you develop strength and increase endurance. Yoga does 
this by stretching the muscles by holding poses, while strength training builds 
the muscles through strenuous, repetitive motions, also known as reps.
The first part of this chapter focuses on yoga. In this section, we review the 
benefits of deep breathing and how to do it the right way. We also provide 
step lists for all the poses and include the Sanskrit/Hindi terms whenever 
possible in case you ever want to take a yoga class. In the strength training 
section, we discuss how bodyweight moves can effectively target all 
your major muscle groups and provide you with step lists for each of the 
strength-training exercises. Images of select yoga poses and strength-training 
exercises are also provided throughout. Of course, you can watch demos 
of any of the yoga and strength-training exercises being performed while you 
are working out with Wii Fit Plus by selecting Demo after you choose your 
activity. For more details on navigating menus, turn to Chapter 1. Let’s get 
started!

46
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
Getting Started
The yoga and strength-training activities are accessed from the Training 
menu. Follow these steps to get started:
 
1. To start yoga or strength-training activities, click the blue Yoga button 
or green Strength Training button on the Training menu.
 
2. When you are at your desired exercise selector menu, pick the activity 
you want to perform.
 
 After you select an activity, you see the exercises summary 
information, including the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) 
value and equipment needed, and have three options: Back, Demo, 
and Start.
 
• Selecting Back returns you to the Yoga or Strength Training 
exercise selector menu.
 
• Selecting Demo activates a quick demonstration on performing the 
activity.
 
• Selecting Start proceeds directly into training at the Activity 
Level indicated (Yoga does not have different activity levels, but 
Strength Training does with the number of reps), unless this is 
your first time selecting the activity, at which point you’ll 
automatically watch a quick demonstration.
 
3. For Strength Training, after you unlock more reps for an activity, you 
can select that activity level by pressing the + and – buttons on your 
Wii Remote or by clicking on the onscreen + and – buttons.
 
Any time during an exercise, you can press + on the Wii Remote to access the 
Pause menu, which gives you the option to Continue playing the current 
session, Retry (this restarts the activity), or Quit, which stops the activity and 
returns you to the Yoga or Strength Training Exercise selector menu.
 
Before starting any exercise program, consulting with a physician is wise. 
This is especially important if you have any of the conditions listed in the 
contraindications section of Table 3-1. After you have your physician’s 
approval and are ready to begin, make sure that you take the time to warm 
up. Although the yoga poses in particular may appear gentle enough not to 
necessitate this, they can be demanding on your joints, ligaments, and muscles. 
By warming up, you are slowly raising your body temperature (hence the term 
“warming up”), which increases the flexibility of these structures and prevents 
tears, strains, and sprains. For more on warming up, turn to Chapter 1.

47
 Chapter 3: Getting Fit with Yoga and Strength Training
Understanding Yoga
You can try numerous yoga styles, but a fundamental goal of each is to unify 
the mind, body, and spirit through a series of poses (referred to by yogis as 
asanas), meditation, and breathing. Although Wii Fit Plus doesn’t get into the 
meditative or spiritual aspects of this discipline, it provides a good introduction 
to some of the more common poses that can help you improve your balance, 
posture, and flexibility. Wii Fit Plus also helps you learn how to breathe 
properly, allowing you to maximize the fat-burning potential of each movement.
Deep Breathing, referred to by yogis as pranayama, is the first choice on the 
Yoga exercise selector menu, and for good reason. Breathing is something 
you do 15 times per minute on average, or approximately 22,000 times daily, 
and is one of those activities you rarely think about, but can have great 
health benefits if done properly. Deep breathing has been found to reduce 
stress, lower blood pressure, ward off or control panic attacks, boost 
immunity, and increase metabolic rate, so learning how to master this skill is 
worthwhile.
Follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart on the Balance Board and 
place your hands on your abdomen, roughly by your navel.
 
 A blue circle, which will shrink and expand, encompasses your virtual 
trainer.
 
2. Slowly inhale through your nose as the blue circle shrinks and exhale 
through your nose as it expands.
 
 Alternately, you can also try inhaling through your nose and exhaling 
through your mouth.
 
3. Relax your stomach after exhalation to let the air back in naturally 
upon inhalation.
 
 Try to keep the red dot in the yellow center of the balance zone on the 
screen.
 
4. Repeat for the full number of repetitions.

48
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
Although it may seem like there is no correct way to breathe, many of us are 
shallow breathers and, therefore, are not oxygenating our cells as optimally 
as we could be, which can reduce performance. To determine if you are a 
shallow breather, place your hand on your abdomen after exhaling and then 
take a normal breath. If you don’t feel your abdomen expand, you are likely 
only using your intercostals — the muscles between the ribs — rather than 
your diaphragm to draw in air. If you discover that this is the case, try 
performing the deep-breathing exercise a few times daily with or without your 
Wii Fit Plus.
Mastering the Yoga Poses
Wii Fit Plus offers a total of 18 poses, which are listed in Table 3-1. When 
doing the poses, always pay attention to your center of balance and your 
breathing to optimize performance and prevent injuries. Your center of 
balance is tracked by the red dot that appears in the yellow balance zone on 
the screen. If the red dot exits the yellow zone, it indicates that your balance 
is off, and the virtual trainer will offer guidance and encouragement to help 
you correct for it. Your breathing is monitored by the blue circle that surrounds 
your virtual trainer. As the blue circle shrinks, slowly inhale through your 
nose, and as the circle expands, slowly exhale through your nose.
 
If you want to add a spiritual aspect to your yoga routine, try taking the name 
of the poses literally. Envision yourself as the warrior, cobra, tree, or whatever 
pose you happen to be doing.

*Yoga poses have many variations, depending on the yoga style; therefore, if you were to take a yoga class, you may find these poses performed slightly 
differently from the Wii Fit Plus versions. For instance, there is a Warrior (Virabhadrasana) I, II, and III, of which the Wii Fit Plus offers Warrior II.
**This list includes the most common contraindications for each pose, but these are by no means the only ones. Before starting any exercise, it is important

 Chapter 3: Getting Fit with Yoga and Strength Training
Standing poses
Wii Fit Plus’s ten standing poses can be broken down into roughly three 
types: stretch, two-legged balance, and one-legged balance. Of course, 
stretch poses require balance and balance poses require stretching, but 
this categorization emphasizes the primary challenge and objective of the 
exercises.
Stretch poses
Stretching is important for everyone, but is especially critical for us pencil 
pushers who spend a great deal of time seated in front of a computer on a 
daily basis. Sitting for extended periods of time puts considerable stress on 
our spines, resulting in poor posture and muscle tension, stiffness, or pain 
in the shoulders, neck, and back. By stretching on a daily basis, you will 
alleviate the stress on your spine, helping to prevent structural degradation. 
Stretching also promotes blood flow throughout the body, which can alleviate 
mental stress and anxiety and is important for muscular health and 
development. The Wii Fit Plus yoga stretch moves effectively target the spine 
and are designed to increase flexibility. Some of the gentler poses are also 
good as warm-ups.
Half-Moon
The Half-Moon (Ardha Chandrasana) is a side stretch pose that targets your 
waist muscles and can improve your posture and digestive health. After you 
learn this pose on Wii Fit Plus, you can easily perform it anywhere, even a 
transoceanic flight. Follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your feet together on the Balance Board and raise your 
arms above you head, interlocking your fingers.
 
2. Bend your upper body to the left and hold the pose.
 
 Make sure to follow the breathing cues and keep the red dot in the 
yellow balance zone.
 
If you master this pose or want to try a variation, keep one arm down at your 
side while extending the other arm above your head. Then bend your upper 
body in the direction of the nonextended arm and hold the pose. Be sure to 
follow the same breathing cues.
Sun Salutation
The Sun Salutation (Surya Namaskar) stretches your arms, thighs, and spine. 
Generally, this pose consists of a series of 12 postures that are performed 
as a sequence, with each posture flowing into the next. Wii Fit Plus’s Sun 
Salutation consists of the first three of these postures. Perform the pose by 
following these steps:

52
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
1. Stand with your feet together on the Balance Board and raise your 
arms overhead in a steady motion, reaching as far back as possible.
 
 You feel as though you are saluting the sun.
 
2. While slowly exhaling, bend forward and touch your toes with both 
hands. If necessary, bend your knees slightly.
 
3. Hold the pose for the duration, following the breathing cues and 
maintaining the red dot in the yellow balance zone.
Triangle
The Triangle (Trikonasana) strengthens your lower body and works your 
waist. Follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your feet together on the Balance Board and move your 
right leg off the Balance Board behind you so that your feet are 
roughly 31⁄2 to 4 feet apart.
 
 Your right foot should be pointing to the right at 90 degrees, and your 
left and right heels should be aligned.
 
2. Raise your right arm above your head while keeping your left arm at 
your side.
 
3. Reach for your left leg with your right hand and raise your left arm 
straight into the air so that it is in line with the tops of your shoulders.
 
 The fingers on your left hand should be separated and your head should 
be in a neutral position or turned so that you are looking at your left 
thumb.
 
4. Push firmly with your heels and toes so that you are putting 60 per-
cent of your weight on your front leg.
 
 You know that you have achieved this when the red bar is maintained in 
the blue zone.
 
5. Hold the pose for the duration, making sure to follow the breathing 
cues and then repeat with the other leg.
 
In the mood for a variation? Instead of raising your arm straight into the air, 
stretch it over the back of the top ear. Your arm will be parallel to the floor 
and both arms will form a backward “C.”
Spine Extension
The Spine Extension (Balasana) works your shoulders, legs, upper arms, and 
waist. It is considered an advanced pose, but it isn’t as difficult as some of 
the poses that are considered non-advanced, especially if you follow the tip 
for this exercise. Follow these steps:

53
 Chapter 3: Getting Fit with Yoga and Strength Training
 
1. Place your right foot on the Balance Board and your left foot behind 
you so that your heels are in line with each other and you have a wide 
base.
 
2. As you inhale, raise your hands up along your sides and bring your 
palms together above your head.
 
3. Release and bring your hands together behind your back with your 
palms together and fingers pointing up.
 
 Relax your neck and shoulders as you expand your chest.
 
4. Exhale and slowly bend your upper body forward, making sure to 
bend from the hips and not your back, as shown in Figure 3-1.
 
 Hold the pose so that you are comfortable and your ability to breathe is 
not impaired.
 
5. With your hips parallel to the floor, pull your chin into your chest and 
stretch your neck. Breathe slowly, and as you exhale, see if you can 
bend deeper.
 
6. Inhale as you raise your upper body and exhale as you bring your 
hands back to your sides.
 
7. Switch legs on the Balance Board and repeat.

If it is too difficult to bring your hands together behind your back, cross your 
arms behind your back instead.
Two-legged balance
Two-legged balance poses allow you to keep both feet on the ground, but 
they still put your balancing abilities to the test, whether by having you 
balance yourself on your toes or by having you shift your weight on the 
Balance Board. These poses help prepare you for the more complicated 
one-legged balance moves and are generally easier to master.
Warrior
There are three variations of the Warrior pose, called Virabhadrasana I, II, 
and III by yogis. Wii Fit Plus offers Virabhadrasana II. This pose, which is 
reminiscent of a fencing lunge, strengthens your thighs and hips and helps 
align your pelvis, improving your posture. Follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your feet together on the Balance Board and move your 
right leg off the Balance Board behind you, so that your feet are 
roughly 31⁄2 to 4 feet apart.
 
 Your right foot should be pointing to the right at 90 degrees, and your 
left and right heel should be aligned.
 
2. Raise your arms so that they are parallel to the floor and reach them 
out to the sides.
 
 Your shoulder blades should be open, your palms down, and your face 
looking forward.
 
3. Bend your left knee over your left ankle, so that your shin is perpen-
dicular to the floor.
 
 Anchor this movement by maintaining weight on your front leg so that 
the red bar remains in the blue area for the designated time.
 
4. Repeat with your right leg.
 
If you are struggling to maintain your balance, try decreasing the distance 
between your feet. On the other hand, if you’ve mastered this pose, you can 
challenge yourself further by increasing the distance between your feet. In 
either case, make sure that the knee of the leg on the Balance Board is still 
over your heel and not your toes.
Palm Tree
The Palm Tree pose on Wii Fit Plus is a variation of the standard Talasana. 
This pose will strengthen your ankles and stretch your back. By stretching 
your spine vertically, it may straighten any minor curves, improving posture. 

55
 Chapter 3: Getting Fit with Yoga and Strength Training
The pose is especially good at relieving tension, so if you are feeling stressed, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Stand on the Balance Board with your feet approximately shoulder-
width apart and feet turned slightly out.
 
2. Slowly raise your arms above your head so that your palms are 
facing out.
 
3. Raise your heels off the Balance Board and move your arms behind 
you so that your palms continue to face out.
 
 You may vaguely feel like Kate Winslet catching the breeze in Titanic.
 
4. Hold the pose for the duration, making sure to follow the breathing 
cues and keep the red dot in the yellow balance zone.
Chair
The Chair pose (Utkatasana) is reminiscent of the rowing squat, which is 
described later in this chapter, and works the same muscles — back, legs, 
and abs. Master the Chair by following these steps:
 
1. Start with your feet shoulder-width apart on the Balance Board.
 
2. Raise your arms in front of you so that your palms are down while 
simultaneously lifting your heels off the Balance Board so that you are 
standing on your toes.
 
3. Lower yourself so that your knees are bent.
 
 You feel like you are sitting in an imaginary chair.
 
4. Hold the pose for the duration while following the breathing cues and 
maintaining the red dot in the yellow balance zone.
 
If you are struggling to maintain your balance, try a more traditional 
Utkatasana by keeping your feet flat on the Balance Board, instead of performing 
the pose while on your toes.
One-legged balance
Unless you are a flamingo, standing on one leg doesn’t come naturally. 
However, as the old adage goes, practice makes perfect, so it pays to be 
persistent. One-legged poses are especially good at helping you become more 
in tune with your body because they require a great deal of concentration. 
Even if these poses seem intimidating, don’t be afraid to give them a try. If 
you are concerned about losing your balance, try performing the moves with 
the Balance Board placed next to a wall or see if someone can spot you.

56
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
A distracted or restless mind can contribute to poor balance. Maintain your 
focus by locking your gaze on a point in front of you, and make sure you 
breathe deeply through your diaphragm (see the section on deep breathing in 
this chapter). If you still have trouble maintaining your balance, see if you can 
find someone to spot you.
Tree
The Tree (Vrksasana) is the quintessential yoga pose. This pose tests your 
ability to maintain your balance and strengthens your thighs, calves, ankles, 
and back. Try this pose by following these steps:
 
1. Start with your feet shoulder-width apart on the Balance Board.
 
2. Pick up your right leg and grab your right ankle with your right hand.
 
3. Place your right foot as far up your left leg as possible, making sure 
your toes are pointing down.
 
 Don’t worry if you can’t lift your leg very high; just place your foot at a 
comfortable level and try to focus on maintaining your balance for the 
duration of the pose. Your center of balance will be tracked by the red 
dot on the screen, which you should strive to keep in the yellow balance 
zone.
 
4. Press your hands together in front of you at chest level, so that they 
assume the prayer position and raise your arms above your head.
 
5. Hold the pose until prompted to finish.
 
6. Repeat with your left leg.
 
Perform this move wearing pants, rather than shorts, which provides traction 
and prevents your foot from sliding down your bare leg. Another way to help 
keep your foot locked into place is to actively press your leg into the sole of 
your foot while at the same time pressing your foot into your leg. After you 
can hold this pose for more than a few seconds, you can further challenge 
yourself by trying it with your eyes closed.
Standing Knee
This pose increases flexibility in your thighs. Perform the pose by following 
these steps:
 
1. Start with your legs close together on the Balance Board.
 
2. Slowly lift your right leg to chest height, or as high as you can 
comfortably get it.
 
3. Hold your right knee with both hands and focus on maintaining your 
balance.
 
4. Repeat with your left leg.

57
 Chapter 3: Getting Fit with Yoga and Strength Training
Dance
This move, also called Natarajasana, is quite elegant and reminiscent of a 
ballet move. Although Wii Fit Plus indicates this move can tone your hips and 
align your spine, it is actually a full body stretch that targets your shoulders, 
chest, abdomen, and legs. This pose is considered an advanced pose, and 
it may be a good idea to have a spotter around the first time you attempt it. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your feet together on the Balance Board.
 
2. Raise your right leg behind you and grab your foot with your right 
hand, bringing your right foot up to your buttocks (your knee will be 
bent), and raise your left hand above your head so that your palm 
faces outward.
 
3. Slowly lift your right foot up and back, extending away from your 
torso so that your right thigh is parallel to the floor, while at the same 
time stretching your left arm forward in front of you, as shown in 
Figure 3-2.
 
 Your arm should be parallel to the floor with your palm facing down and 
your fingers pointed forward.
 
4. Repeat with your left leg.

Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
If you can’t grab your foot, you can try using a belt or other strap to hold it. 
Remember, you can always slow down and take the pose at your own pace.
Floor poses
Wii Fit Plus offers seven poses that are performed on the floor, only three of 
which use the Balance Board. These poses stretch and increase strength, 
but because most of them are not monitored, it is especially important to 
proceed with the moves cautiously and stretch only within your limits. These 
poses are best performed on an exercise mat. If you don’t already own one, 
turn to Chapter 13 for some recommendations.
Downward-Facing Dog
The Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana) is a common yoga 
pose that targets your back while stretching your whole body. This pose 
is thought to relieve sinusitis, headaches, and constipation. However, if 
you suffer from high blood pressure or are suffering from a headache, it is 
advised that you support your head on a bolster or block so that your ears 
are level between your arms. This pose uses the Balance Board. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Get on all fours with your hands on the Balance Board, about 
shoulder-width apart, and your knees directly under your hips.
 
2. Exhale while you lift your hips as high as possible and straighten your 
arms and legs.
 
 Try to distribute your weight evenly between your hands and feet; if you 
are successful doing this, the red bar on the screen remains in the blue 
area.
 
3. Hold the pose for the duration, making sure to follow all breathing 
cues.
 
If you want to challenge yourself further, try raising one of your legs so that it 
is parallel to the line of your torso. Hold this pose as long as possible and then 
perform it again, raising the opposite leg.
Cobra
Don’t be fooled by the Cobra’s (Bhujangasana) seeming simplicity. This 
pose is considered an advanced user pose. The Cobra is highly effective in 
stretching and strengthening the back muscles, helping to improve your 
posture. No Balance Board is required for this activity. Follow these steps to 
do the Cobra:

59
 Chapter 3: Getting Fit with Yoga and Strength Training
 
1. Lie face down with your forearms on the floor and your chest open.
 
 Your legs should be spread behind you.
 
2. While inhaling, extend your elbows and lift your upper body off the 
floor.
 
Don’t be discouraged if you can’t raise your upper body that far, and above 
all, don’t force the backbend. Finding a height that is comfortable for you will 
prevent back strain. To do this, take your hands off the floor for a moment. 
The height you achieve by doing so is through extension, preventing an 
exaggerated bend that can result in injury. Another option is to remain in the 
Sphinx pose, which is the first step in the Cobra pose and is considered the 
“infant of backbends.” If you remain in Sphinx pose, make the most of it by 
lightly lifting your belly away from the floor to create a dome that rounds up 
toward your lower back. This move is subtle, and you should not suck your 
belly in to achieve it.
Bridge
The Bridge pose (Setu Bandha Sarvangasana) is a more advanced backbend 
than the Cobra, and is considered an advanced user pose. The Bridge 
strengthens the torso and hips while stretching the neck and chest. If you are 
concerned about injuring your neck, consider placing a thickly folded blanket 
or towel under your shoulders for protection. This pose is performed sans 
Balance Board. Follow these steps:
 
1. Lie face up with your knees bent, arms at your sides, and your feet flat 
on the floor as close to your buttocks as possible.
 
2. As you exhale, lift your hips off the floor until your thighs are roughly 
parallel to the floor.
 
3. Keep your knees directly over your heels and make sure your thighs 
and inner feet are parallel.
 
 Your thighs should not touch.
 
 Your virtual trainer instructs you to hold the pose for 30 or 40 seconds, 
but you should only hold it for as long as is comfortable.
 
If you are looking to be more active, you can try lifting your hips up while 
slowly exhaling and rolling your body back down one vertebra at a time while 
slowly inhaling. If, on the other hand, you want to try a variation to the static 
Bridge, clasp your hands below your pelvis after you lift your hips off the 
floor.

Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
Spinal Twist
The Spinal Twist, often referred to as Jathara Parivrtti, has many variations. 
The version Wii Fit Plus offers stretches your back and helps align your 
pelvis. Although the pose sounds menacing and uncomfortable, it is meant to 
be relaxing. However, the Spinal Twist is an advanced user pose. Concentrate 
on your breathing throughout the pose to optimize its restorative effects. Put 
your Balance Board aside and follow these steps:
 
1. Lie face up on the floor, with your right arm stretched out to your side 
at shoulder height.
 
2. While exhaling, bend your right knee and use your left hand to guide 
and hold it down on your left side.
 
 Be sure to release any tension from your hips and let your leg rest where 
it feels comfortable.
 
3. Turn your head to the right and try to keep your right shoulder on the 
floor.
 
 You can feel the stretch from your hips through your back.
Shoulder Stand
This pose, which is perhaps the most advanced of all Wii Fit Plus yoga poses, 
offers an inversion and strengthens the abs and back while aligning the legs. 
Because the Shoulder Stand (Sarvangasana) has the highest risk for injury, 
respecting your limits is necessary. One precaution you can take is to place a 
folded blanket or towel on the mat for your upper back and shoulders to rest 
on (your head and neck will be on the mat, not the blanket or towel), which 
helps prevent your neck from being injured when you raise your legs and 
bear your weight into the floor. The Balance Board is not used for this pose. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Lie face up on the floor with your arms at your sides, ensuring that 
your head and spine are aligned.
 
2. Lift both legs upon inhaling and then lift your back.
 
3. Bend your elbows and use your hands to support your back.
 
 The higher up you place your hands, the straighter your pose will be.
 
4. Straighten your body as you raise your legs toward the ceiling, using 
your shoulders for support, as demonstrated in Figure 3-3.
 
 Keep your breathing slow and deep for the duration of the pose.
 
5. To come out of this posture, gradually lower your hands to the floor, 
pressing your arms and palms into the mat for support.

61
 Chapter 3: Getting Fit with Yoga and Strength Training
 
6. Contract your abdomen while slowly lowering your upper back and 
finally buttocks back onto the mat.
 
7. To finish, lower your legs while pressing your lower spine into the 
mat.

Gate
This Gate pose (Parighasana), considered an advanced user pose, opens the 
shoulders and stretches your hamstrings, spine, sides of the torso, and the 
muscles connecting the ribs, which are known as the intercostals. Because it 
elongates the intercostals, this pose allows the rib cage to move more freely, 
increasing the capacity of the lungs to draw in breath. As a result, the Gate 
pose is thought to be especially good for those with respiratory problems, 
such as asthma. Grab your Balance Board and follow these steps:
 
1. Face left, go down on one knee, and put your right foot on the Balance 
Board.
 
2. Raise your left arm straight and extend your right hand over your 
knee, making sure to keep your left arm and thigh perpendicular to 
the floor.

62
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
3. Exhale and slowly lower your upper body to the right. Place your 
right hand on your ankle and expand the left side of your rib cage, as 
shown in Figure 3-4.
 
 Try to distribute 30 percent of your weight to the right and hold this 
pose for 30 seconds while you breathe.
 
4. Inhale and come back to the starting position. Exhale and drop your 
hand.
 
5. Stand up and repeat with your left leg.

Grounded V
This Grounded V pose is similar to the yoga Boat pose (Navasana), which 
is outlined in Chapter 11, except that you keep your hands behind you for 
stability instead of stretched out toward your legs. As the name of the pose 
implies, you will be making a V-shape with your body. This pose can be 
challenging and is considered an advanced user pose. For this pose, you are 
seated on the Balance Board. This activity is great at targeting your core. 
Follow these steps:

63
 Chapter 3: Getting Fit with Yoga and Strength Training
 
1. Sit on the Balance Board and place your hands behind you for 
support.
 
2. Bring your legs together and exhale as you lift them up.
 
 If you need to, bend your knees, but keep your calves parallel to the 
floor. Keep your back straight and concentrate on your abdomen. Hold 
this pose for 30 to 40 seconds as you breathe.
 
3. Exhale and slowly bring your legs down to the starting position.
Beginning Strength Training
When you think of strength training, you may envision a sweaty, grunting 
behemoth with bulging biceps throwing weights around at a gym. Yet there 
are numerous ways to effectively strength train without using weights. The 
method that Wii Fit Plus uses is body-weight training. Many people assume 
that body-weight training is not effective because the moves appear to be 
too simple to be of much value. To see firsthand why this is not the case, 
we suggest you get on the floor and try to do a push-up. How easy was it? If 
you haven’t done a push-up since high school gym class, you may find it was 
quite challenging. Body-weight training helps you get strong relative to 
your own body weight and forces you to be very self-aware. You are not 
concentrating on moving a weight through space, but have to be cognizant of 
how you are moving your own body through space.
Wii Fit Plus offers 15 strength-training exercises and three challenges, as 
shown in Table 3-2. By showing you where your center of balance actually is 
versus where it should be, Wii Fit Plus ensures that you hit all muscles that 
can be targeted with a particular movement. This is feedback you don’t get 
from fitness videos or at the gym, unless you have an experienced training 
partner or personal trainer.

 Chapter 3: Getting Fit with Yoga and Strength Training
Working your lower body
Whether you’re walking about town or running up stairs, your legs are your 
base of power. Because your legs contain some of the largest muscle groups 
in your body, building these muscles gives you a leg up on your overall 
fat-burning efforts. Luckily, your leg muscles are also among the quickest 
to respond to training, so they will be among the first areas where you can 
achieve visible results.
Single-Leg Extension
Like most of the Wii Fit Plus strength-training movements, the Single-Leg 
Extension does not fit neatly into one body part category or section. In this 
case, the Single-Leg Extension is a compound movement that involves the 
back of the arm (triceps), the abs, and the front (quads) and bottom (calf) of 
the leg, requiring a good deal of coordination and balance. Perform the 
exercise by following these steps:
 
1. Start with both feet on the Balance Board, and then lift and stretch 
your right leg backward as you move your right arm upward and 
forward.
 
 Your left leg is used for balance and support, so it helps to tense your 
quads and calf throughout the set, as well as your abs.
 
 At the top of the movement, your right leg, torso, and right arm should 
be in a straight line at a roughly 45-degree angle.
 
2. As you fully extend your right arm, flex your triceps to maximize 
impact on the muscle. Similarly, as you fully extend your right leg, 
flex your buttocks.
 
3. As you return to the starting position, your right foot remains raised 
to roughly just below the top of your left calf muscle rather than back 
on the Balance Board.
 
4. Repeat the motion for the indicated number of repetitions before 
placing both feet back on the Balance Board and performing the same 
movement with the other side of your body.
 
You must proactively maintain your balance by keeping the red dot on the 
screen within the yellow balance zone.
 
Performing strength-training exercises at a fast pace places a high level of 
stress on the muscles and connective tissue at the beginning of each movement. 
Performing them at a slower pace requires a more even application of muscle 
force throughout the movement range and produces greater muscle tension. 
Although Wii Fit Plus helps you regulate speed for many exercises, another 
great way to add further challenge to your exercise regimen is simply to slow 
down.

66
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
Lunge
Lunges are not just for fencers, they’re also a great way for the rest of us 
to work our upper legs and buttocks. Though Wii Fit Plus suggests that the 
lunge is good for toning — which we are not denying — it is also a test of 
balance. Follow these steps:
 
1. Start by clasping your hands behind your head and maintaining a 
rigid posture, with your chin up and your eyes looking straight ahead.
 
 Keep your abs tensed the whole time to help maintain this posture.
 
2. Step onto the Balance Board, and then move your left leg back.
 
 At this point, your left knee should be at a roughly 90-degree angle and 
directly above your toes.
 
3. Slowly descend until your left knee is nearly touching the ground, and 
the onscreen progress bar passes the indicator line.
 
4. While maintaining your posture, drive your body upward.
 
5. Repeat for the required number of repetitions before performing the 
same movement with your right leg.
Rowing Squat
The squat is often called the “King of Exercises” and with good reason. 
Besides being extremely challenging, it’s one of the most powerful ways to 
build strength and muscle in your upper thighs and buttocks. Wii Fit Plus 
incorporates a variation on the traditional squat by incorporating a rowing 
motion that involves the back muscles. Although your body weight provides 
sufficient resistance when squatting, the effect on the back when rowing 
is purely from how you contract and squeeze those muscles. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Start by placing both feet on the Balance Board and then placing both 
arms straight out in front of you, palms facing down.
 
 Keep your head up and your stomach muscles contracted the whole 
time.
 
2. As you slowly bend your knees, start to pull your arms down and back 
to just above your belly button until your palms face each other at the 
side of your body, contracting and squeezing your back muscles.
 
 If done correctly, your back muscles should be at maximum contraction 
while you’re at the low point of the squat. As indicated by the red dot on 
the screen, try to keep your center of balance in the blue area.

67
 Chapter 3: Getting Fit with Yoga and Strength Training
 
3. Reverse the motion to return to the starting position and complete 
your first rep.
 
4. Continue the movement for the indicated number of repetitions.
 
You can make the rowing squat more challenging by squatting even lower. 
Just be sure to maintain your center of balance at all times.
Single-Arm Stand
The Single-Arm Stand, which targets your abdominals and thighs, is an 
exercise that requires a great deal of coordination. Follow these steps:
 
1. Start by lying on your back with your left arm fully extended and 
holding the Wii Remote.
 
2. With your left arm still extended, use your right arm to begin to push 
your body up while keeping your abs tensed.
 
3. Complete the movement by standing fully upright, continuing to keep 
your left arm fully extended and legs tensed.
 
 The onscreen red line monitors your balance throughout the movement.
 
4. Continue performing the Single-Arm Stand for the required number of 
reps, and then repeat for the other side.
Side Lunge
Side Lunges target the major muscles of the lower body, but may place less 
strain on your knees. Wii Fit Plus adds a stretch to this activity, allowing 
you to work the muscles between your ribs (intercostals) simultaneously. 
Perform the activity by following these steps:
 
1. Stand on the Balance Board and extend your left leg out to the side, 
about the distance of one Wii Balance Board.
 
2. Extend your left arm upward and place your right hand across your 
left side so that it rests on your stomach at roughly your navel.
 
3. Bend your right leg and lean over your right side, as shown in 
Figure 3-5.
 
 Stabilize your balance in your bent leg as you stretch. Be careful not to 
let the knee of your bent leg extend past your toes.
 
4. Return to the start position and repeat the motions for the required 
number of repetitions. Repeat for the other side.

Single-Leg Reach
The Single-Leg Reach targets your thighs, buttocks, and core, while putting 
your balancing abilities to the test. This activity is advanced, so you may 
want to enlist the help of a spotter on your first attempt while following these 
steps:
 
1. Stand on the Balance Board and slowly move your left hand and left 
leg simultaneously.
 
 Your left hand will be above your head and your knee will be bent and 
raised so that your upper leg is parallel to the floor.
 
2. Bring your left leg back, lower your left hand down to the floor, and 
hold this position, as shown in Figure 3-6.
 
 Your upper body should be parallel to the floor.
 
3. Lift your body back up and repeat for the required number of 
repetitions. Once complete, repeat for the other side.

Working your upper body
If you consider all your daily activities, you may find that most require use 
of your upper body. Many of these activities aren’t given a second thought, 
such as opening a door — unless, of course, a particularly heavy one is 
encountered. By regularly working your upper body, many daily activities 
will become much easier, and there will be fewer doors you can’t open. While 
gaining definition in your upper body may take longer to achieve, you don’t 
need 20-inch biceps to be strong; even spaghetti arms can be powerful. Of 
course for many, the muscles of the upper body are considered the “show 
muscles,” so aesthetics alone may be reason enough to work the area hard.
Push-Up and Side Plank
The Push-Up and Side Plank is another example of Wii Fit Plus taking a 
relatively straightforward movement — the push-up (also known as 
press-up) — and adding an additional step that ratchets up the difficulty, 
in this case the side plank. Push-ups work the pectoral (chest) muscles and 
arms, and side planks tone the shoulders and arms. Follow these steps:

70
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
1. Start by placing your hands an equal distance apart on the Balance 
Board and extending your legs behind you until your entire body is in 
the raised and prone position on the balls of your feet.
 
 It is important to stabilize your entire body before proceeding from this 
step so that you can maintain your form and balance throughout the 
movement.
 
2. Once stabilized, follow Wii Fit Plus’s prompts to bend just your arms 
down, then back up, where you should squeeze your chest.
 
3. Once at the top position and prompted to do so, move to the Side 
Plank by extending your right arm off the Balance Board and back 
while your right leg moves behind your left foot, as shown in Figure 
3-7. On full arm extension, squeeze your right triceps.
 
4. When prompted, move your right leg and right arm back to their 
original positions.
 
 For the next rep, repeat the same sequence for the other side of your 
body.
 
The closer together your hands are when performing push-ups, the less you 
emphasize your chest and the more you emphasize your triceps.

and Side 
Plank apex.

 Chapter 3: Getting Fit with Yoga and Strength Training
Plank
In some countries, the Plank is called a parallel stretch, and with good 
reason, as it’s a literal description of the exercise. The Plank helps to 
strengthen your core muscles, including your abdominals, which can 
increase flexibility and improve posture. Follow these steps to do the Plank:
 
1. Start by placing your forearms on the Balance Board and loosely grip 
the end with your fingers.
 
2. Extend your legs out and rise up on the balls of your feet as if you’re 
about to do a push-up, but leave your arms in place.
 
3. Use your abdominals and other core muscles to stabilize and hold 
your position while keeping your balance to hold the onscreen dot as 
steady as possible for the predetermined length of time.
Tricep Extension
You can put your Balance Board aside for this one, because all you need is 
the Wii Remote. As you might guess, Tricep Extensions work your triceps 
(the back muscles of your upper arms). Follow these steps:
 
1. Grasp the Wii Remote in your left hand and raise your arm so it’s 
pointing straight up, parallel to your head. Use your right hand to 
stabilize the back of your left arm just below the elbow.
 
2. Follow the onscreen indicator and extend your left arm, being sure to 
squeeze the triceps when you reach the top.
 
3. After completing the required number of repetitions, repeat for the 
other arm.
Arm and Leg Lift
The Arm and Leg Lift is another one of those exercise combinations that 
defies easy categorization and is equally at home under Lower Body, because 
it works your upper leg and buttocks. However, it is listed here under Upper 
Body, because it also works your triceps and shoulders. Like the Tricep 
Extension, the Arm and Leg Lift is performed with just the Wii Remote. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Start in a stabilized kneeling position on all fours with the Wii Remote 
in your left hand.
 
2. Extend your left arm and right leg at the first whistle, squeezing your 
triceps and buttocks at full extension.
 
3. Using the onscreen guide, hold this position steady until the second 
whistle, at which time you return your left arm and right leg to the 
starting position.

72
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
4. Perform the required number of repetitions, and then repeat for the 
other side.
Balance Bridge
The Balance Bridge works your triceps, core, and buttocks. Although you will 
be on the ground for this activity, a great deal of balance is required, as the 
name of this exercise implies. This exercise is an advanced activity, and you 
may want to enlist the help of a spotter before following these steps:
 
1. Sit on the Balance Board, place your hands behind you for support, 
and bend your legs in front of you.
 
 Make sure your body is fully supported before you proceed.
 
2. Lift your hips and straighten your arms while extending your right 
leg when the Raise triangle aligns with the yellow triangle at the top 
meter.
 
 Keep your upper body aligned with your lower body, so that it appears 
that you are forming a bridge, as shown in Figure 3-8. Your back should 
be straight and parallel to the ground.
 
3. Bring your buttocks down and leg back in after the yellow triangle 
clears the Raise bar, and repeat the entire sequence for the required 
number of repetitions.
 
4. Repeat for the other leg.

Whittling your waistline
Washboard abs certainly rank high (if not highest) on most people’s wish 
list. The good news is that unlike other body parts, it is difficult to overtrain 
your abs, since they recover from exercise stress quickly. Because you want 
to keep your abs tensed when doing all the other exercises, you’ll be working 
them constantly; however, Wii Fit Plus has strength-training moves that 
specifically target this often problem area.
 
Abdominal exercises alone will not reduce the waist or define this muscle 
group. Only in conjunction with a healthy diet and a drop in body fat will you 
be able to see a change in definition.
Torso Twists
If you have “love handles” that you do not love, this exercise is for you! Torso 
Twists are especially effective at targeting the side abdominal muscles. To 
chisel your abdomen, follow these steps:
 
1. Start with your feet shoulder-width apart on the Balance Board with 
your toes pointed slightly out.
 
2. Raise your arms to the side so that they are shoulder height and your 
palms are facing down.
 
 Make sure that you keep your core, especially your abs, tight at all 
times.
 
3. Using controlled movements, twist your torso from left to right, slowly 
moving your left shoulder forward and down as you twist so that your 
left arm is pointing down and your right arm is elevated above your 
head.
 
 Your arms will end perpendicular to the Balance Board.
 
4. Repeat this movement on the other side, twisting from right to left, for 
the required number of repetitions.
 
Avoid moving your hips or bending your back. Twist slowly and within your 
limits to avoid injury.
Jackknife
What is the first exercise that pops into your head when you think of working 
your abdomen? We would wager it is the sit-up, which is precisely what the 
Jackknife improves upon. Follow these steps:
 
1. Start by lying on the floor with your knees bent, heels resting on 
the Balance Board with your toes pointed up at an approximately 
45-degree angle, and arms stretched out above your head.

74
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
2. At the sound of the first whistle, raise your legs and upper body at the 
same time, so that you form a V shape.
 
3. At the second whistle, lower your body to the start position. Squeeze 
and contract your abs as you lift your body.
 
4. Perform the required number of repetitions.
 
 Do this exercise slowly; too much momentum can cause you to strain 
your back.
Single-Leg Twist
This exercise is another to add to your muffin-top-fighting arsenal. Single-leg 
twists target the oblique muscles, or sides, of your waistline. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Place your right hand on your hip, raise your left hand above your 
head, and lift your right leg off the Balance Board, making sure there 
is a slight bend in your knee.
 
2. Simultaneously raise your right leg and lower your left arm, bringing 
your right knee and left hand together at roughly your midline, as 
shown in Figure 3-9.
 
3. Bring your arm and leg back to the starting position. After your set, 
repeat on the other side.
 
Because you are balancing yourself on one leg throughout this exercise, watch 
your posture to make sure that you stabilize your upper body to keep from 
leaning forward.
Sideways Leg Lift
Unlike the other Wii Fit Plus waistline moves, this one works your shoulders 
in addition to the side abdominal muscles, also known as the oblique mus-
cles. Follow these steps:
 
1. Start this exercise with your right hand on your right hip, then raise 
your left hand above your head while lifting your right leg sideways 
off the Balance Board.
 
 Your right leg will be approximately at the height of the opposing knee 
and there should be no bend in either knee.
 
2. Lower your right leg so that it hovers just above the Balance Board 
and is parallel to your left leg, while at the same time slowly bringing 
your left arm down enough for your fingers to be pointed toward the 
ground.

75
 Chapter 3: Getting Fit with Yoga and Strength Training
 
Figure 3-9: 
Single-Leg 
Twist apex.
 
 
3. After you complete all your repetitions, repeat this movement on the 
opposite side.
 
Keep your body steady as you move your arms and legs, and make sure to 
squeeze your shoulder muscles and your abs when you lift your arm and leg, 
respectively.
Stepping up to the challenges
If you do well in the higher difficulty settings of the Push-Up and Side Plank, 
Jackknife, and Plank, you will unlock these challenges, respectively, which 
appear in the fourth row of the Strength Training exercise selector menu. 
When performing challenges, your virtual trainer’s personality changes from 
supportive to competitive, and you can put the proverbial metal to the 
virtual pedal and really test your limits. The goal is to outperform the virtual 
trainer in the number of repetitions performed or to hold a pose for longer.

76
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
Push-Up Challenge
Challenge your virtual trainer to see who can do more Push-ups. You do 
consecutive sets of ten repetitions at a time until either you or the trainer 
can’t do any more. If you beat the virtual trainer, he or she comes back 
stronger the next time you try, increasing the challenge until you are able 
to reach 100 repetitions, at which point you will have maxed out on the 
challenge.
 
Listen to the whistle. It will be your guide for the correct Push-up timing. If 
your timing is off, it may not register as a repetition.
Plank Challenge
Unlike the other challenges, which are based on repetitions, the Plank 
Challenge tests who can hold the pose the longest. You do consecutive sets 
of ten seconds each until either you or the trainer can’t do any more. If you 
beat the virtual trainer, he or she holds the Plank longer the next time you 
try, increasing the challenge until you’re able to reach 180 seconds, at which 
point you’ll have maxed out on the challenge.
Jackknife Challenge
You really feel the burn in your abs as you challenge your virtual trainer to 
see who can do more Jackknifes. You do consecutive sets of ten repetitions 
at a time until either you or the trainer can’t do any more. If you beat the 
virtual trainer, he or she comes back stronger the next time you try, 
increasing the challenge until you’re able to reach 100 repetitions, at which 
point you’ll have maxed out on the challenge.

In This Chapter
▶ Discovering My Wii Fit Plus
▶ Assessing icons
▶ Examining the preset routines
▶ Customizing routines
▶ Reviewing Favorites
O
ne of the criticisms of the original Wii Fit was that it did not offer any 
routines. The Wii Fit Plus developers address such criticism through 
My Wii Fit Plus. You can choose from a list of routines that are designed to 
help you achieve a certain goal, such as youth or health, or you can try your 
hand at designing your own routine. If you like elements of two different 
routines, Wii Fit Plus even lets you combine them; the options are virtually 
limitless. Certainly, having so many choices helps prevent boredom and 
keeps you engaged.
In this chapter, we review all that My Wii Fit Plus has to offer, including how 
to build your own routines and combine routines. We also provide a table of 
the preset routines for you to easily refer back to, and discuss some of the 
icons on the My Wii Fit Plus screen, such as the Calorie Check.
Starting My Wii Fit Plus
You can access My Wii Fit Plus from the Training Menu or by clicking on the 
door on the Calendar screen. The My Wii Fit Plus screen resembles a locker 
room, which is fitting considering that it serves as workout central when 
it comes to routines. You also encounter an old friend here, your virtual 
Balance Board. If you click on him, you can practice any of the ten available 
Balance Tests, provided you’ve done them before while taking a Body Test.

78
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
For more on the Balance Tests, turn to Chapter 2.
You have several options to choose from on the My Wii Fit Plus screen, 
including Calorie Check, Fit Credits, Change Trainer, and What are METs? 
icons on the left and Wii Fit Plus Routines, My Routine, and Favorites buttons 
on the right, as shown in Figure 4-1. The following sections help you discover 
what these options are all about.
 
Figure 4-1:

Plus screen.
 
Going Over the Icons
Although it doesn’t take a Sherlock Holmes to figure out what lies behind 
those four icons on the My Wii Fit Plus screen, our job is to ensure that you 
have all the information necessary to make the most of Wii Fit Plus. So, bear 
with us as we quickly walk you through what each of these icons has to offer.
Burning calories
Clicking on the Fork, Plate, and Knife icon allows you to set the number of 
calories you’d like to burn daily by clicking on the Calorie Burn Goal button. 
You can use this feature to see how many calories you need to burn to 
counter that hot-fudge sundae you’ve just eaten. Follow these steps to set 
your Calorie Burn Goal:

79
 Chapter 4: Working Out with My Wii Fit Plus
 
1. Browse through the food items, as shown in Figure 4-2, for 
informational purposes or if you want to find the calorie count 
for a food you wish to burn off.
 
2. When you are ready to set your caloric goal, click the green Calorie 
Burn Goal button at the bottom right of the screen.
 
 Doing this pulls up the Goal Food menu, as shown in Figure 4-3.
 
3. From this menu, select the food item that represents the number of 
calories you want to burn daily.
 
 As you hover over the Goal Food items, you can see how many calories 
they have.
 
4. When you are happy with your selection, click the Set button or click 
the Back button if you prefer to select a different Goal Food item.
 
 Keep in mind that you can change this goal anytime by clicking on 
Calorie Burn Goal and selecting Remove or Change. Remove erases your 
daily goal settings, whereas Change pulls up the Goal Food menu again. 
Simply click on the item you want, and your new goal is set.
 
The highest Goal Food item is a chocolate bar at 455 calories, whereas the 
scroll-through list includes food items up to a calorie count of 860. Although 
you can’t set your Calorie Burn Goal that high, you gain a good perspective on 
how many calories foods you may regularly eat or drink contain. For example, 
you may think that the taco salad you like to eat for lunch is a healthy option, 
only to discover that it actually has a whopping 655 calories. You can use this 
feature as a nutritional guide, and if there are items not on the list that you are 
curious about, you can visit the same source from where this information came: 
USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. You can access it by 
visiting www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search.
After you finish your workout, you can check how close you are to your 
Calorie Burn Goal by clicking on the Fork, Plate, and Knife icon. Your calories 
burned for that day are displayed in red on top of the scroll-through list. You 
can also see how many calories are left to reach your goal after you complete 
a workout through Wii Fit Plus Routines.
Checking Fit Credits
Clicking on the Graph icon enables you to check how many Fit Credits are in 
your Fit Bank, and they are color coded so that you see how your Fit Credits 
were earned. The default is a 1-week view, but you can see larger time 
intervals by clicking the + and – signs onscreen or on your Wii Remote.

Changing your trainer
Clicking on the Face icon enables you to change between the male and female 
trainer. After you select a trainer, you are asked if that is the trainer you 
want. If so, click OK, and if not, click the Back button to choose the one you 
really meant. Consider switching trainers every few workouts to help mix 
things up. To keep things interesting, the trainers’ hairstyles change every so 
often, and one day you may find your male trainer sporting a new ponytail.

81
 Chapter 4: Working Out with My Wii Fit Plus
Understanding METs
This icon is available only after you’ve spent some time training with Wii Fit 
Plus and have already been presented with a definition of METs, which are 
metabolic equivalents of task. You can turn to Chapter 1 for more on METs. 
We’ve also included tables in Chapters 3, 5, and 6 that list the MET value for 
each activity discussed in those chapters. When the MET icon becomes 
available to you in My Wii Fit Plus, you can click on it anytime to get a recap 
of METs and calorie expenditure.
Working Out with Wii Fit Plus Routines
The Wii Fit Plus routines are designed to help you target certain areas, such 
as a specific body part or your balance skills. You can select from Lifestyle, 
Health, Youth, and Form, each of which has three different focus areas with 
its own routines, all of which include three exercises, as shown in Table 4-1. 
You can opt to perform only one of the routines from these focus areas by 
clicking the one you want and then selecting Start. You can also opt to create 
your own routine by combining the available routines, which can be done 
by clicking the Combine button at the Wii Fit Plus Routines Menu screen. 
Whereas My Routines only allows you to select Yoga and Strength Training 
activities, these incorporate other Wii Fit Plus activities.

83
 Chapter 4: Working Out with My Wii Fit Plus
coded by category, with blue for Lifestyle, yellow for Health, green for Youth, 
and pink for Form. Hovering over each icon gives you the workout title. Refer 
to Table 4-1 for the activities included under each workout title. You can also 
choose from three activity levels, including one at a time, two at a time, and 
three at a time. Selecting one at a time randomly pulls one exercise from each 
of the workouts you’ve selected, two at a time randomly pulls two exercises, 
and three at a time includes all the exercises. Any routines you combine are 
one-time use and are not stored. If you want to perform the same activities 
again, you have to make the same selections, but there are no guarantees 
that the workout will be the same unless you choose three at a time. As you 
add activities, you can see the approximate workout time just above the Start 
button. You also cannot include a particular workout more than once on your 
exercise queue.

Making My Routine
As the name implies, My Routine lets you to create your very own routine. 
Although Wii Fit Plus offers many different activities, the only ones available 
here are Yoga and Strength Training. This may be a bit of a disappointment, 
but Yoga and Strength Training exercises are the ones that whip you into 
shape, and you can always perform some of the other activities afterwards to 
reward yourself.

84
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
Creating your routine
After you click on My Routine, you see Yoga and Strength tabs at the top, as 
shown in Figure 4-5. You can toggle between them to select the exercises you 
want by pointing to the desired exercise and then pressing A. After you have 
chosen an exercise, a yellow frame appears around it, and you see it listed on 
the right in the Selected Exercises menu. Unlike in My Wii Fit Plus Routines, 
you can select the same exercise more than once. To swap exercises, point 
to the one you wish to eliminate from your repertoire and press A, and then 
click on its replacement and press A again. To remove an exercise from your 
routine, press B. If you want to start from scratch, click the dial-like button 
to the left of the Start button, which resets the workout. Be careful. After 
you click this button, your items are instantly deleted. As you add or remove 
items, you can see the total workout time listed directly above the Start 
button increase or decrease, respectively. When you are happy with your 
workout, click the Start button to begin. Table 4-2 is a master list of exercises 
that indicate whether they target your upper or lower body and if they are 
good for warming up and cooling down. You can refer to this table to cus-
tomize your routine, and whether you want to target your upper body, lower 
body, or entire body.

which exercises you want to incorporate, as shown in Figure 4-6. You can 
select from 5 minutes up to 60 minutes by clicking on the + and – buttons 
onscreen or on your Wii Remote. Select Yoga to include only yoga poses in 
your workout. Select Strength if you prefer only strength training activities. 
You can also select both to create a workout with a combination of the two.

Favorites
Clicking on Favorites on the My Wii Fit Plus screen pulls up a menu that 
shows the ten exercises you’ve done most frequently, recently, and rarely, 
as shown in Figure 4-7. Although you can see how many times you’ve 
performed an exercise when you click on an activity from any exercise 
selector menu accessed through the Training Menu, having a ranked list can 
be helpful. After all, human being are creatures of habit and there are certain 
activities that we naturally gravitate to, often without even thinking about it. 
These lists can help you keep challenging yourself by showing you trends, 
which may serve as the impetus to move you out of your comfort zone. For 
example, you can see if you frequently perform activities focused mostly on 
one body part or whether you perform one type of activity, such as strength 
training. If so, you can customize your workouts to address this, or simply 
pick some of your rarely performed activities and put those into your next 
workout.

Breaking a Sweat with Aerobics
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the benefits of aerobics
▶ Toning up
M
any people equate exercising with performing aerobic activities, 
such as running on a treadmill or bicycling, because there are more 
immediate effects: Your heart starts pounding, sweat starts dripping, and 
your body starts to feel the burn, psychologically indicating fat is melting 
away. Although aerobic exercises shouldn’t be your sole form of exercise, 
they are an extremely important component of a well-rounded physical 
fitness regimen. Aerobic activities improve the efficiency of your heart, lungs, 
and circulatory system when performed regularly.
Wii Fit Plus’s aerobic exercises meet all the criteria for a good aerobic 
workout, but unlike riding a stationary bike or walking a treadmill, these 
activities also keep you mentally engaged, whether by catching hoops or 
looking for hidden Super Mario Bros. icons on the jogging trails.
In this chapter, you are introduced to the various Wii Fit Plus aerobic 
exercises, including descriptions of each one. Tips on performing the 
exercises are also provided.
Getting Started
To access the aerobics exercises, select the red Aerobics button on the 
Training menu. Once at the Aerobics Selector Menu, pick the activity you 
want to perform. Table 5-1 outlines the available Wii Fit Plus aerobics 
activities, including those that appear under Training Plus, which is 
covered in Chapter 6. After you select an activity, you see the game 
summary information, including which equipment is needed for the activity 
and how many metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs) the activity is worth, 

90
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
and you have the choice of two options: Back and Start. Selecting Back takes 
you back to the Aerobics Selector Menu. Selecting Start will proceed directly 
into training at the Activity Level indicated; the Hula Hoop, Basic Step, and 
Advanced Step have only one Activity Level. If an exercise has additional 
Activity Levels that have been unlocked, these can be accessed by clicking 
the + on your Wii Remote. Click – on the screen or the Wii Remote to go to a 
lower Activity Level.
 
Any time during the activity, you can press + on the Wii Remote to access the 
pause menu, which will give you the option to continue playing the current 
session, retry the activity (this restarts the activity), or quit the activity and 
return to the Aerobics Selector Menu.

Toning Your Body
Wii Fit Plus offers nine aerobic exercises under the Aerobics Selector Menu, 
but four distinct activities: running, step exercises, boxing, and Hula Hoop, 
as outlined in Table 5-1. Running and step exercises are especially good at 
working the lower body, the Hula Hoop works your core muscles — your 
torso minus your arms and legs — and boxing trains your upper body; thus, 
all your major muscle groups are covered. Some additional aerobic exercises 
are offered under the Training Plus Selector Menu, including Rhythm Kung 
Fu, Rhythm Parade, and Basic Run Plus, and these options are described in 
detail in Chapter 6.
As you can see from Table 5-1, all of Wii Fit Plus’s aerobic activities are rated 
between 3.0 and 5.0 METs. Exercises between 3.0 and 6.0 METs are consid-
ered moderate-intensity physical activities, whereas those above 6.0 METs 
are considered vigorous physical activities. No activities in Wii Fit Plus are 
higher than 5 METs; thus, the intensity of your workouts is usually moderate. 
To reap the greatest benefit from these moderate-intensity aerobic activities, 
your target heart rate zone should be 50 to 75 percent of your maximum 
heart rate. Table 5-2 provides average target heart rates by age. See the 
“Determining target heart rate” sidebar for more on target heart rate.
Determining target heart rate
Monitoring your target heart rate is a simple 
way to assess your exercise intensity and 
track your fitness levels. All you have to do is 
periodically take your pulse as you exercise 
and then stay within 50 to 75 percent of your 
maximum heart rate, which is considered your 
target heart rate. Since your heart rate will 
start to go down after stopping the activity, be 
sure to take your pulse within five seconds of 
stopping to ensure the greatest accuracy. 
Count your pulse for ten seconds and then take 
that number and multiply it by six. Voila, you 
now have your pulse rate.
Table 5-2 shows estimated target heart rates 
for different ages. You can use this as a guide 
to determine your target heart rate by using 
the values for the age closest to your own. If 
your age is not listed or you prefer more exact 
numbers, even though the difference will be 
but a few beats, you can determine your target 
heart rate with a simple calculation. First, 
determine your maximum age-related heart 
rate by subtracting your age from 220. Take this 
number and multiply it by 50 percent and then 
by 75 percent. You’ve now got your target heart 
rate zone. Here is an example for a 32-year-old:
220 – 32 = 188
50 percent level: .50 × 188 = 94
75 percent level: .75 × 188 = 141
Target Heart Rate Zone: 94–141 beats per 
minute

92
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
Before starting any activities, be sure to warm up. You can do this by 
performing a graduated, low-intensity aerobic exercise, such as walking in 
place for a few minutes. Some of the lower-intensity aerobic exercises in Wii 
Fit Plus also work well, such as Rhythm Parade. For more on warming up (and 
cooling down), turn to Chapter 1.
 
If you are taking medications, especially certain blood pressure medications, 
these values may not apply to you, as some drugs lower the maximum heart 
rate and thus the target heart rate zone. If you are on any medications, it is 
strongly advised that you speak with your physician before using target heart 
rate to gauge your exercise intensity.

Pounding the pavement
Wii Fit Plus running activities (Basic Run, 2-P Run, and Free Run) are best 
performed by jogging in place at a steady pace. If you try running and end 
up going too fast, your Mii will fall and you will receive fewer Fit Credits at 
the end of the activity. Jogging is also less taxing on your body, especially if 
you are not used to running, and it allows you to increase your fitness levels. 
These activities are not performed on the Balance Board, so if you are going 
to be doing them on a hard surface (non-carpeted area), you may want to put 
on a pair of sneakers to minimize shock to your knees as you pound the 
proverbial pavement.

93
 Chapter 5: Breaking a Sweat with Aerobics
 
In addition to using Wii Fit Plus to track your progress, consider investing in a 
pedometer to see how many steps you are taking during these activities and 
daily. You may be surprised to find that you are not taking as many as you 
thought. Strive for 10,000 steps daily, which is equivalent to roughly 5 miles.
Basic Run
For this exercise, you are putting your Balance Board aside and your 
movements will be tracked by the Wii Remote. Place the Wii Remote in 
your pocket or hold onto it if you don’t have pockets. If you hold onto the 
Wii Remote, make sure to use and secure the wrist strap to prevent the Wii 
Remote from dropping during the activity. After the countdown and Start 
prompt, begin jogging in place at a steady pace so that you won’t pass the 
Mii guide in front of you. Your Mii guide is a generic Mii and not one on your 
system, though you will encounter familiar Miis along the way as you make 
your way through the course. Be sure not to go too fast; otherwise your Mii 
will end up falling. To optimize the calorie burning potential of this exercise, 
swing your arms in big motions as you jog; if you are holding the Wii Remote 
in your hands, your Mii may run faster if you swing your arms faster than the 
pace of your feet. Your advancement through the course is tracked by the 
meter at the bottom of the screen, along which a mini version of your Mii’s 
head advances as you progress toward the goal. The medium-sized circle
in the middle of the meter indicates the half-way point of the course, and 
Wii Fit Plus also alerts you when you have reached this point and provides 
encouragement to keep going.
Although your Mii will traverse picturesque island terrain on the Short 
Course, which is available from the outset, you would likely become bored 
if this course were your only option. Fortunately, there are numerous other 
courses that can be taken. There are two longer courses, the Long Course 
and the Island Lap Course, both of which need to be unlocked. The Long 
Course becomes available once the Short Course has been completed, and 
the Island Course becomes available once the Long Course has been com-
pleted. The trail options don’t stop here though. On each of these courses, 
you can take an alternate course by following any of the single dogs that run 
past you — not those headed in a pack toward you. When you see one of 
these dogs, quickly run past your guide and start following the dog. An “Oh! 
You’ve passed your guide!” message appears, which is followed by “Now, 
follow the dog.” If you see another single dog pass the one that you are 
following, you can elect to follow it instead, leading to yet more alternatives. 
To get an overview of the entire terrain and available trails, refer to the Wuhu 
Island Running Map in your Wii Fit Plus instruction booklet. In addition to 
taking in the various sites along the way, there are numerous iconic marks 
from Super Mario Bros. scattered about the island for you to discover, including 
Mario, Luigi, star men, magic mushrooms, and others; an example is shown in 
Figure 5-1. How many can you find?

94
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
The number of Wii Fit Plus credits achieved on each course varies based on 
your performance. A steady pace yields more credits than an erratic one, so 
the motto of “slow and steady wins the race” certainly goes a long way here.

2-P Run
This is the same as the Basic Run, except that you can now add a second 
player as a running partner. The screen is split for this activity. One side 
shows your Mii and the other your partner’s generic Mii. As for all Wii Fit Plus 
running activities, your Balance Board is placed aside and you and your 
partner’s movements are tracked by your respective Wii Remotes; however, 
only your results will be saved.
Free Run
For Free Run, you can run or jog in place for 10, 20, or 30 minutes. Initially, 
you are given ten minutes, but the other durations become available as you 
complete the subsequent activity. Although you can run the course on the 
screen, the idea of this mode is to allow you to watch TV while you work out. 
Verbal guidance is provided through the Wii Remote’s speakers.
 
The prompts and feedback on your pace can be difficult to hear, especially 
if you have surround sound and are watching your favorite action movie. 
Increasing the volume of the Wii Remote in the Remote Setting menu may 
help; turn to Chapter 1 to find out how. It may also be best to hold the Wii 
Remote in your hand rather than putting it in your pocket, where the sound 
may become muffled by your clothes.

 Chapter 5: Breaking a Sweat with Aerobics
Stepping up to fitness
Step aerobics, which involves stepping up and down an elevated platform, 
originated in the late 1980s and quickly took off. Although this activity can 
provide a great workout, step bench heights generally range from four to 
ten inches, and the Balance Board has a height of just over two inches. As a 
result of this, you will not be working your muscles as intensely as you would 
with a traditional step aerobics program, and, therefore, won’t reap as much 
physically from this activity as from some other Wii Fit Plus exercises.
 
If you find that you enjoy Wii Fit Plus’s step aerobics programs, you can 
consider purchasing a special riser to elevate your Balance Board to the 
standard 4-inch height, which gives a boost to the workout potential of this 
activity. Turn to Chapter 13 to find out more about this accessory.
Basic Step
This activity is the step aerobics take on DanceDanceRevolution, as you will 
be stepping on and off the Balance Board in a choreographed pattern based 
on the beat of the music and onscreen prompts, which consist of arrows 
and cute little feet that appear in a vertical scrolling panel in the middle of 
the screen. This panel resembles a series of Balance Boards, and when a 
board in this panel becomes yellow and is rimmed in red, it means you need 
to execute the move that is shown. The goal is to step on and off the board 
in sync with the other Miis, who happen to be master steppers and nod in 
appreciation at you when you are in step with them. Initially, the movements 
are quite basic, and you will simply be stepping up when you see the red feet 
and down when you see the red arrows. However, halfway through, things 
get more complicated with the introduction of blue feet and arrows, which 
requires you to step off to the side of the Balance Board. In some cases, 
a blue arrow and two feet on either side of a board in the scrolling panel 
appear, with one foot being a lighter blue, as shown in Figure 5-2. This light 
blue foot indicates the foot that stays put; only the darker foot moves per 
the prompt indicated. If you find these feet confusing, you can ignore them 
and just try to follow the blue arrows. The feet simply illustrate the foot 
placements that the blue directional arrows are indicating.
 
If following the onscreen prompts proves too challenging, try watching the 
Miis and following their movements until you get the hang of it and catch the 
beat.

Advanced Step
 
This is a much faster version of the Basic Step with the introduction of two 
new moves. The activity starts the same as the Basic Step, with a set consisting 
of simply stepping on and off the board. Shortly thereafter, the side stepping 
with blue arrows and feet from Basic Step is introduced, except that you now 
also have to clap along with the other Miis when indicated, which you will be 
required to do for the remainder of the game; you will see little hand icons 
on the screen. Following a brief pause, a whole new move is introduced with 
green feet and arrows, which require you to kick your leg out in front of you; 
however, if you watch the Miis, they are not really kicking their legs out and 
are basically keeping their foot suspended in the air for the beat. After two 
rounds with the green feet and clapping, another new move is introduced 
with purple feet and arrows. You now have to step on and off the Balance 
Board sideways — first to the left and then to the right. Shortly thereafter, 
you go through the entire series of moves again, but at a much faster pace. 
As with Basic Step, if you have a tough time staying in sync with the beat, try 
following the Miis.
Free Step
If you want to step up and down on your Balance Board while watching your 
favorite television show, this is the activity for you. You can do this for 10, 
20, or 30 minutes, though only 10 minutes is available to you initially. The 
Wii Remote speaker provides you with feedback and keeps you apprised of 
how much time you have left. It also plays a rhythmic tone for you to follow. 

97
 Chapter 5: Breaking a Sweat with Aerobics
You can adjust the tempo of this tone by pressing up or down on the Wii 
Remote’s directional pad. If you don’t like the tone that is playing, you can 
change or eliminate it by pressing the A button. If you have a tough time 
hearing your Wii Remote speaker, you can adjust its volume by going into the 
Remote Settings menu; turn to Chapter 1 to find out how. You may also opt to 
hold the Wii Remote in your hand rather than putting it in your pocket, which 
may muffle the sound.
Knocking out fat
Punches have been thrown since the dawn of mankind, but the first historical 
records of boxing as a sport date back to the ancient Greeks. The sport has 
remained incredibly popular, with numerous styles developing through the 
ages in different cultures. Boxing has numerous benefits, especially when 
you do not have to worry about being pounded to a bloody pulp by an actual 
opponent. Some of these benefits include improved hand-eye coordination, 
increased strength and cardiovascular endurance, as well as improved fat 
burning. So put up your dukes and start throwing some punches, Wii Fit Plus 
style!
Rhythm Boxing
If you think you are going to have the opportunity to duke it out with another 
Mii, think again — this is family-friendly Nintendo, after all. Instead, you get 
to pound a punching bag with robot-like arms. Unlike all other activities, 
this game incorporates the Wii Remote, Balance Board, and Nunchuck. You 
are instructed to hold the Wii Remote in your right hand and the Nunchuck 
in the left, though you can switch hands at your discretion without penalty. 
Because this activity is not as straightforward as the other activities, it is 
essential to pay close attention as the Mii Trainer demonstrates each 
pattern of moves, which you have to mimic. To execute punches, you first 
have to step forward off the front of the Balance Board toward the punching 
bag. Your score is based on your timing, with each perfectly timed punch 
accruing two points versus one for less desirable moves. Try throwing 
punches immediately after the target appears on the punching bag. This 
activity has several durations, with three minutes being initially available. As 
the duration increases, so does the difficulty of the patterns that you must 
mimic. Toward the end of the three-minute exercise, there will be a five-
second Bonus Time in which your trainer will allow you to throw punches 
any way you want to; see Figure 5-3. You do not have to step on and off the 
Balance Board for this round, so focus on racking up the points by getting 
in as many punches as possible to knock out your punching bag opponent. 
Longer durations have longer bonus rounds.

Getting your virtual hoop on
Although Hula Hoop is a registered trademark of Wham-O, Inc., a toy 
company that was founded in 1948 and is still in existence today, it is in fact 
an ancient invention that has been used throughout history by countless 
cultures for different purposes. It was also constructed of numerous 
materials, ranging from wood to grapevines. The plastic Hula Hoops that we 
know today were first commercialized in the late 1950s by Wham-O, and the 
craze quickly caught on, with over 100 million sold the first year it was on the 
market. More recently, use of hoops has emerged as an aerobic fitness trend, 
often referred to as hooping or hoopdance, though these activities tend to 
use custom, weighted hoops. Exercising with the Hula Hoop has numerous 
benefits beyond the cardiovascular, such as strengthening your core, 
increasing spinal flexibility, and improving coordination, all of which are also 
provided with Wii Fit Plus’s virtual hoop, so get those hips swaying.
Hula Hoop
The goal is to quickly rotate your hips in a circular motion to keep your 
Mii’s Hula Hoop on its waist while getting in as many spins as possible in a 
70-second period; the faster you spin, the more points you acquire. The timer 
appears at the top right of the screen and the spin meter appears at the top 

99
 Chapter 5: Breaking a Sweat with Aerobics
center of the screen. Two Miis holding Hula Hoops face you and will on 
occasion toss a Hula Hoop your Mii’s way, which you have to catch, as shown 
by Figure 5-4. This can present quite a challenge. If you don’t place enough 
weight on the proper side of the Balance Board to catch the Hula Hoop, your 
leaning won’t register. One way to ensure you catch those Hula Hoops is to 
raise your arms above your head while leaning in the proper direction; this 
should be done immediately after the Hula Hoop is thrown. Once the Hula 
Hoop is caught, you should quickly get back into full swing to rack up as 
many points as possible, as each Hula Hoop caught will register as a rotation 
of your hips on the spin meter.
 
Figure 5-4:

Hoop being

catch it.
 
Super Hula Hoop
The mechanics are the same as for Hula Hoop, except that there are two 
rounds, both of which put 180 seconds on the clock. For the first round, you 
sway your hips to the right, and for the second round, you sway them to 
the left. At the end of both of these rounds, Wii Fit Plus draws each of your 
rotations for each side on the screen and comes up with a schematic that 
illustrates your average rotation on the right and the left. It also indicates 
how many rotations were done on each side and proceeds to rank you.

eeping your muscles and cardiovascular system strong is important, 
but equally essential is honing your balance skills and keeping those 
mental muscles sharp. To facilitate this, Wii Fit Plus offers 24 game-based 
activities that test the reflexes, mind and body coordination, balance, and 
memory. Unlike other Wii Fit Plus activities, most of the Training Plus and 
Balance Games activities won’t cause you to break a sweat, but they can be 
enjoyed by the whole family, including young children.
This chapter gives you an overview of all Wii Fit Plus Training Plus 
and Balance Games activities, reviewing game mechanics and scoring. 
Screenshots are provided for select activities. The role of the vestibular 
system in achieving balance is also discussed. Because these games are all 
quite gentle, requiring subtle movements, or in the case of the meditative 
Lotus Focus (a Balance Game), extreme focus while sitting motionless on the 
Balance Board, they can be used as part of the warm-up regimen before 
starting any of the other Wii Fit Plus activities. See Chapter 1 for more on 
warming up. They also can be used to test your mastery of some of the 
other Wii Fit Plus activities that require you to balance yourself, such as the 
one-legged yoga poses that are discussed in Chapter 3.
Starting Training Plus 
and Balance Games
To access the Training Plus activities, select the gray Training Plus button on 
the Training menu, or to get to the Balance Games, click the yellow Balance 
Games button instead. At the Training Plus or Balance Games selector menu, 

102
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
pick the activity you want to perform. After you select an activity, you see 
the game summary information, including which equipment is needed for 
the activity and how many metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs) the activity 
is worth. You have the choice of two options: Back and Start. Selecting Back 
takes you back to the Training Plus or Balance Games selector menu, 
depending upon which one you were on. Selecting Start proceeds directly 
into training at the activity level indicated. If you’ve already unlocked 
additional activity levels on a particular game, these can be accessed by 
clicking the + on the screen or pressing the + on the Wii Remote. Click – on 
the screen or press – on the Wii Remote to go to a lower activity level.
 
You can press + on the Wii Remote any time during a game to access the 
pause menu, which gives you the option to Continue Playing the Current 
Session, Retry to restart the activity, or to Quit, which brings you back to the 
Training Plus or Balance Games selector menu.
Exploring Training Plus
All training options listed under the Training menu are self-explanatory, 
except, perhaps, Training Plus. This option is new to Wii Fit Plus and features 
15 assorted activities, as shown in Figure 6-1, including some balance games, 
aerobic activities, agility tests, and exercises that engage the mind. Table 6-1 
is a master list of Training Plus activities and their objectives. Because this 
option is unique to Wii Fit Plus, even Wii Fit gurus may want an overview of 
this uncharted territory.

Perfect 10
For this game, your Mii is surrounded by mushroom caps on which numbers 
appear. Your objective is to shake your hips front, back, left, or right to hit the 
mushrooms with the numbers that will add up to 10, as shown in Figure 6-2. 

104
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
Use small, focused hip shakes, because exaggerated movements may result 
in you inadvertently hitting the wrong mushroom. If this ends up being the 
case, just hit the mushroom again to subtract it from your total, which is 
tracked at the top of the screen. You have 60 seconds to complete 20 rounds. 
For the first ten rounds, there are three mushrooms, and for the last ten, a 
fourth mushroom appears in front of you, compounding the arithmetic 
challenge. Additional challenges can be unlocked, including an Advanced 
level, where you have to add to 15, and an Expert level, where you have to 
add to 20. These levels have more rounds, but also give you a little more time 
to work with.

Scoring: Scoring is based on the time you take to complete all rounds. If you 
don’t make it through all rounds in the time allotted, the number of rounds 
successfully completed will be logged for your User Ranking.
Island Cycling
For this activity, you step on the Wii Balance Board to pedal your bicycle 
around Wuhu Island. The Wii Remote, which you hold horizontally in front 
of you, serves as your virtual bike’s handlebars. As a result, your bike goes 

105
 Chapter 6: Training Plus and Balance Games
in the direction that you tilt your Wii Remote. The objective is to clear all the 
checkpoints, which appear as flags, and return to the starting line. A small 
map appears in the right corner, allowing you to see the location of the flags. 
You can press and hold 1 on your Wii Remote to zoom out on an area of your 
map. The beginner course has 13 checkpoints, and additional courses can be 
unlocked.
Scoring: You have to clear all checkpoints for your score to be logged, which 
will then be recorded as the number of miles you cycled.
Rhythm Kung Fu
For this activity, you have to copy the martial arts movements of the other 
Mii characters in time with the rhythm. The Mii characters on the outside 
move first. After they complete their moves, you have to perform the same 
moves on the same beat. Initially, Wii Fit Plus instructs you on which body 
part to move, and you need to replicate only one move. But this activity 
quickly progresses through a more complex series of timed moves, and you 
have only your sense of rhythm to rely on. The beginner level has 35 moves. 
More advanced levels can be unlocked, which feature more moves. For 
example, the Advanced level has 42 total moves.
Scoring: Your score is determined by the number of Perfects, OKs, and 
Misses, worth 20, 10, and 0 points, respectively.
Driving Range
If you want to improve your golf swing and become the next Arnold Palmer 
or Lorena Ochoa, this game is for you. Otherwise, you may not find it to be 
anything special. The game assesses your center of balance and weight shift 
as you swing the Wii Remote, which represents a golf club. You may choose 
between Approach Shot, Iron, and Driver, and you have to rotate your 
Balance Board 90 degrees before you can begin. After you select whether 
you are left- or right-handed, Wii Fit Plus gives you a golf tutorial. After you 
get through that, you can start practicing. You have 20 balls to hit. As you hit 
them, your center of balance is traced out by a red dot during the swing, and 
you can also click on the Swing Analysis button at the top left of the screen to 
get more comprehensive feedback on how you did.
Scoring: You get ten points for each Nice Shot, five points for each OK Shot, 
and zero for any Missed Shot.

Segway Circuit
Always wanted to ride a Segway? Now is your chance to take a virtual version 
along Sugarsand Beach on Wuhu Island. As with Island Cycling, you hold the 
Wii Remote in front of you to control the direction of your Segway left and 
right. Leaning forward moves the Segway forward and leaning back makes it 
go in reverse. Your objective is to pop as many beach balls as possible. You 
can press and hold 1 on your Wii Remote to zoom out on an area of your 
map, which appears in the lower-right corner of your screen, to locate all 
the balls. Watch out for the moles, which reside in holes below the balls, as 
shown in Figure 6-3. Should you run into one, you will be docked five points. 
You can press A to have your dog pop the balls as well. A mole tries to run 
away with the last ball, and you have to chase him down to pop it. You have 
180 seconds to complete the beginner level.
 
Figure 6-3: 
Avoid the 
moles that 
live in holes 
under the 
beach balls.
 
Scoring: You receive 10 points for each beach ball popped, 100 points for 
catching the ball-stealing mole, and 1 point for each second remaining on 
your clock.
Bird’s-Eye Bull’s Eye
If you’ve always wanted to fly or you like the chicken dance, you’ve hit pay 
dirt. For this activity, you stand on the Wii Balance Board and flap your arms 

107
 Chapter 6: Training Plus and Balance Games
to reach various targets. Lean in while flapping your arms to move forward 
and shift your weight right or left to turn in either direction. Initially, 60 
seconds are on the clock. Each target has one or more numbers on it, which 
represent seconds. As you land on the targets, the number you land on is the 
number of seconds that get added to your clock.
Scoring: After you reach the goal target, you can score 10, 20, 30, 50, or 100 
(for Bull’s Eye chicken) bonus points, depending on where you land. You also 
receive one point for each second remaining on your clock. If you don’t make 
it to the goal target before time runs out, your distance will be logged.
Snowball Fight
Now you can engage in snowball fights without freezing your buns off. Lean 
left or right on the Balance Board to move out from behind your protective 
barrier to throw snowballs at your opponents. To hit your opponents, aim 
the Wii Remote at the screen and press A when the bull’s-eye is on your 
target. Watch out for incoming snowballs. Getting hit temporarily obstructs 
your view, reduces your health, and results in game over if you get hit with 
too many. The three hearts at the bottom center of the screen represent your 
health. The longer you avoid getting hit by snowballs, the faster your health 
will refill when you do get hit. Ninety seconds are on the clock for the beginner 
levels. The more advanced levels, which can be unlocked, have longer 
durations.
Scoring: Your score is recorded as hits, and you receive one point for every 
target that you hit.
Obstacle Course
You step in place to walk or run, and then straighten your legs to jump over 
obstacles or land on mobile platforms along this obstacle course, which is 
reminiscent of some of the Super Mario Bros. worlds, especially when having 
to dodge Chain Chomp-like impediments, as shown in Figure 6-4. The 
beginner level has three platforms, with 80 seconds on the clock. When you 
clear a level by reaching a checkpoint, 30 seconds get added to the clock 
and you are lifted to the next platform. The advanced level features a more 
challenging course that includes icy surfaces. If you get knocked off course, 
you are brought back to the beginning of that platform and will have the 
same number of seconds on the clock as when you got thrown off. When time 
runs out, the game is over.

Scoring: If you reach your goal, you get one point for every yard that you 
clear as well as one point for every second left on your clock. Otherwise, 
your score is recorded in yards.
Tilt City
For this activity, you have to hold the Wii Remote out in front of you and tilt 
it while shifting your weight on the Balance Board to tilt the three onscreen 
platforms to guide the dropping red, blue, and yellow balls into the matching 
pipe. The top platform resembles your Wii Remote and is controlled by 
it, whereas the two lower platforms resemble your Balance Board and are 
controlled by your shifting weight. The beginner level has 25 balls. More 
advanced levels can be unlocked, which increase the number of balls for you 
to coordinate. The advanced level has 40 balls.
Scoring: You receive points for each ball dropped into the correct pipe, with 
the balls with the Mii characters on them earning you bonus points. You also 
earn bonus points for dropping balls in consecutively. A perfect score is 250 
on the beginner level. You do not receive or lose any points for any balls 
dropped into the wrong pipe.

Rhythm Parade
If you’ve always wanted to be in a marching band, lead the Rhythm Parade, 
which combines elements of a music game with stepping in place in time 
with the whistle. For the activity, the Wii Remote is in your right hand and 
the Nunchuk in your left as you stand on the Balance Board. After you start 
marching in time with the whistle, two circles appear onscreen, which 
represent your right and left hands. When the scrolling icons hit either circle, 
flick your hand accordingly, as you continue to step in place and lead your 
band through the parade. If you keep the beat, your band grows, but if you 
don’t the band members will stop following. You know that you are keeping 
time if blue sparks emanate from your Mii’s feet as you march, as shown in 
Figure 6-5. On the advanced level, the scrolling icons drop much faster.

Unless you have a wireless Nunchuk, when flicking your hands to get those 
icons as they fall into the circles, flick downward rather than upward to avoid 
getting hit in the face with your Nunchuk’s cord.
Scoring: You receive five points for every Perfect, one point for every OK, 
and zero for every Miss.

Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
Big Top Juggling
For this activity, your Mii stands on a large ball while juggling. When a ball is 
thrown in your Mii’s direction, catch it by bringing your hand upward when 
the ball reaches you. Once caught, flick your hand and then your other hand 
to juggle it. Keep repeating these movements to keep the juggle motion going. 
More balls are thrown at you until you reach three balls. Watch out: Some 
naughty Miis are going to start throwing bombs at you. Be sure to dodge 
them. You have 90 seconds to accumulate points. The advanced level gives 
you five balls with 120 seconds on the clock.
Scoring: You receive one point for the initial successful juggle, two points for 
the second, three points for the third, and so on until you reach ten points, 
after which all successful juggles will be worth ten points, unless you lose a 
ball. Keep juggling those balls successfully and one of your balls will turn into 
an apple and be worth 20 points for every successful juggle.
Skateboard Arena
See if you can become the Tony Hawk of the Skateboard Arena. For this 
game, your Balance Board becomes your skateboard, and you need to turn 
it 90 degrees toward your television and stand sideways on it. Push off the 
ground with your right foot to skate forward and lean left and right to turn. 
If you find that you are slowing down, you can lean to the side to gain speed. 
The beginner level includes six levels, which progressively add more tricks 
for you to perform, such as riding rails and doing wheelies.
Scoring: You start with 60 seconds on the clock. You get points for skate-
boarding or doing tricks over the blue bars, while hitting cones deducts a 
point. As you complete a level, 30 seconds get added to the time you have 
remaining on your clock. For Level 1, you must gain 8 points to advance; 
Level 2, 10 points; Level 3, 10 points; Level 4, 5 points; Level 5, 7 points; and 
Level 6, a whopping 40 points. This equals a total of 80 points for completing 
the levels, and then you get 1 point for every second left on your clock.
Table Tilt Plus
This version is more challenging than Table Tilt in the Balance Games, which 
we describe later in this chapter. The objective is to successfully navigate 
your Mii-balls into the holes by tilting the floating platform by shifting your 
bodyweight left, right, forward, and back on the Balance Board. Movements 
should be subtle to prevent the balls from dropping off the table. If one or 

111
 Chapter 6: Training Plus and Balance Games
more balls drop off, you have to wait for the platform to make a 180-degree 
turn before your Mii-ball(s) are returned to the board, and if you had any 
Mii-balls left on the platform, their positions may be affected by the plat-
form’s rotation. Each table has unique contours and obstacles for you to 
navigate around or use to guide your Mii-balls into the goal holes, as shown 
in Figure 6-6. You have 60 seconds to complete all levels. This one is so 
challenging that we couldn’t even determine how many levels are needed to 
complete the activity at the beginner level. Level 6 is a killer!
 
Figure 6-6:

Mii-balls

holes.
 
Scoring: You get six points for every Mii-ball successfully guided into the goal 
holes, which also adds six seconds to your timer. If you do manage to complete 
all levels, the total number of balls placed in the goal is added to the time 
left on the clock. Scores in the triple digits are possible but very difficult to 
achieve!
Balance Bubble Plus
This version of Balance Bubble is a much more challenging version than the 
one we describe later in this chapter. Your Mii appears in a bubble in a river, 
and your job is to safely navigate your Mii through the course by avoiding the 
river’s edge and obstacles by leaning forward, backward, left, and right on 
the Balance Board. The farther forward you lean, the faster your Mii travels 
down the river, whereas leaning back will slow your Mii down. Leaning left 
and right steers your Mii accordingly. Keep movements subtle and control 

112
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
your speed until you become comfortable with the course, because you must 
navigate tight twists and turns, including an area where you have limited 
visibility and various pillars to circumvent. You have two minutes to 
complete the beginner course.
Scoring: This game is scored based on time, but if your Mii’s bubble bursts 
before you reach your goal, your score is recorded in yards.
Basic Run Plus
You will put your Balance Board aside for this aerobic activity that also tests 
your awareness. You run the course, as you would for any of the running 
activities outlined in Chapter 5, but you are given a quiz about what you 
saw on your run at the end of the activity. You are asked questions like “Did 
you ever fall down?” and “How many dogs did you see?” The quiz is multiple 
choice.
Scoring: Your score is given as a percentage that includes your Burn Rate 
and Mental Focus.
Improving Your Balance with Games
Balance exercises typically focus on developing the lower body while also 
targeting the vestibular system. So, what is the vestibular system? Without 
going into too much detail, which is well beyond the scope of this For 
Dummies book or the expertise of its authors, the vestibular system comprises 
the structures that make up the labyrinth of the inner ear, including the 
cochlea, which is also part of the auditory system; the anterior, posterior, 
and lateral semicircular canals, which detect rotary (circular) motion; and 
the otolithic organs, which detect linear acceleration. These structures help 
control eye movements and work with the visual system to keep objects in 
focus when the head is in motion. They also send signals to the neural 
structures that control the muscles that keep you upright, allowing your 
body to make adjustments as needed to maintain equilibrium.
So, now you may be wondering just how you can “exercise” the vestibular 
system. Wii Fit Plus Balance Games target the vestibular system by requiring 
you to move your head, body, and/or eyes according to visual and auditory 
cues onscreen while you are being provided with feedback on your balance 
in real-time, allowing you to make conscious adjustments. As you continue 
to play these games, your vestibular system will be trained to make many 
of these adjustments without you consciously having to think about them, 
thereby improving your balance. Table 6-2 outlines Wii Fit Plus Balance 
Games.

Soccer Heading
The objective of this game is precisely what its title implies — to head soccer 
balls that other Miis kick your way. There are 80 soccer balls for the beginner 
level and 120 for the advanced level. Of course, there are some naughty little 
Miis who enjoy kicking cleats and panda heads at you, as shown in Figure 6-7, 
which you will have to dodge to avoid point deductions. To head the soccer 
balls and avoid the cleats and panda heads, you shift your weight left and 
right on the Balance Board, depending on which object is flying in your 
direction. Making contact with the soccer balls is all about getting the right 
timing and avoiding exaggerated movements. Your body tilts should be 
subtle and adjusted as soon as the ball or undesirable object is kicked your 
way. Unlike your Mii on the screen, you do not need to lean forward. Simply 
shifting your bodyweight left and right is all it takes to make contact with 
objects or dodge them.
Scoring: Getting hit with a cleat deducts one point from your total score, 
whereas those soccer-like panda heads cost you three points. Your goal 
should be to hit as many balls in a row as possible without getting hit with an 
obstacle in the process, which activates bonuses for each ball: one point for 
the first ball hit, two for the second, and so on until you reach a maximum of 
ten points per ball. The perfect score is 555 points on the beginner level and 
655 on the advanced level, which is unlocked after you complete the beginner 
level.

Ski Slalom
The objective is to guide your Mii between the red and blue flags on the 
course as quickly as possible without missing any. Gates that are missed 
result in a seven-second penalty. To guide your Mii through the slalom 
course, lean left and right so that your Mii skis between the flags. Movements 
should be subtle. Leaning too much in either direction makes it difficult to 
change directions quickly enough for you to guide your Mii between the flags. 
You can increase your speed by leaning forward and slowing down by leaning 
backward. To achieve an optimal speed, position yourself so that the balance 
point located in the upper-right corner of the screen is maintained in the blue 
balance bar. This may prove difficult at first. You may want to concentrate 
on improving your time only after you are able to comfortably guide your Mii 
between all the flags.
Scoring: Scoring is all about completing the course in the least amount of 
time possible. Every missed gate results in a seven-second penalty being 
added to your total time. A score of 18 seconds on the beginner setting 
would give you a perfect, 4-star rating. A time of 30 seconds with no missed 
gates would give you a perfect, 4-star rating on the advanced level, which is 
unlocked after repeated play of the beginner level.

115
 Chapter 6: Training Plus and Balance Games
Ski Jump
The objective of this game is to achieve the farthest cumulative distance (in 
meters) in two jumps. Like the Lotus Focus and Penguin Slide, there is no 
advanced setting to unlock. You start the activity with your knees bent and 
your body leaning forward. To achieve the optimal position, make sure the 
red balance dot in the upper-right corner of the screen appears in the blue 
balance zone (also a dot in this case); maintaining it slightly above the blue 
dot will allow you to gain additional speed. After your Mii reaches the red 
jump zone at the end of the ramp, straighten your knees as quickly as possible 
and stand as straight and centered as possible for the duration of the jump. 
The trick to mastering this is to “jump” at the right moment. If you straighten 
your knees too early or too late, your Mii will fall off the ramp and turn into a 
virtual snowball.
 
It may take at least a few tries to overcome your natural instincts, but 
remember when “jumping” you’re merely extending your legs from the bent 
position to get your Mii airborne. If your feet leave the Balance Board at any 
time, Wii Fit Plus will end your game immediately.
Scoring: The distance you achieve on both jumps is added together for the 
final score. So far, the highest score we’ve seen online is a cumulative 404 
meters; the average score appears to be between 120 and 160 meters per 
jump or a cumulative score between 240 and 320 meters.
Snowboard Slalom
This game requires you to reposition your Balance Board, rotating it 90 
degrees clockwise, so that it better resembles a snowboard. As with the Ski 
Slalom, the objective is to guide your Mii between all the red and blue flags 
on the course as quickly as possible. Follow the arrows on the flags. The 
red flags have arrows that point right and the blue flags have arrows that 
point left, as shown in Figure 6-8. To guide your Mii accordingly, lean your 
body forward and backward instead of shifting your weight left and right. To 
achieve the optimal speed, adjust your position so that the red balance dot 
appears in the blue balance zone; the meter is located at the top right of the 
screen. All movements should be subtle, because exaggerated movement 
causes your Mii to stray too far off course, making it more likely that you 
will miss one or more turns. A miss results in a seven-second penalty being 
added to your time. A meter that tracks misses is located on the lower left of 
the screen, but you will also be alerted with a sound when you miss a turn.

116

Scoring: Again as with the Ski Slalom, the goal is to complete the course as 
quickly as possible while not missing any gates. Any misses add seven 
seconds to your time. A time of around 18 seconds earns a 4-star rating at 
the beginner level and a time of about 28 seconds garners a 4-star rating at 
the advanced level. The advanced level is unlocked after you complete the 
beginner level.
Table Tilt
This game is perhaps one of the most challenging of the Balance Games, 
though not nearly as challenging as Table Tilt Plus discussed earlier in this 
chapter. Table Tilt can be thought of as the opposite of the classic wooden 
labyrinth puzzle, where instead of trying to keep a ball out of the holes, the 
goal is to get one or more balls in a hole. To successfully complete this 
activity, you must complete eight different levels before time runs out.
To tilt the floating platform and guide your Mii-balls into the holes, you shift 
your bodyweight left, right, forward, and back on the Balance Board. Holding 
your arms out to the sides may help improve your balance. Movements 
should be subtle to prevent the balls from dropping off the table. Although 
many platforms have a curved edge, which acts as somewhat of a protective 

117
 Chapter 6: Training Plus and Balance Games
buffer, it doesn’t take much to tilt the platform enough for those Mii-ball(s) 
to drop. Don’t worry: This won’t end the game, but it will cost you some 
precious time, because you will have to wait for the platform to make a 180-
degree turn before your Mii-ball(s) are returned to the board. Furthermore, 
if you had any Mii-balls left on the platform, their positions may be affected 
by the platform’s rotation, potentially setting you further back. However, 
sometimes dropping balls can be advantageous, because it can facilitate 
getting others in the holes. Each table has unique contours, and with practice, 
you learn how to avoid or use them to your advantage. After you complete 
Level 8, your Mii-balls cheer you on as they return to their Wii form, as 
though a curse has been lifted.
Scoring: Completing a level scores you 10 points and adds an additional 20 
seconds to the clock. There are a total of eight levels to complete, and one 
point is awarded for each second you have left at the end. A score of 0 to 
29 nets you one star; 30 to 79, two stars; 80 to 99, three stars; and 100+, four 
stars.
Tightrope Walk
Ever want to walk a tightrope? Now you can do so without worrying about 
going splat. For this activity, you walk in place to guide your Mii across a high 
wire straddled between two skyscrapers while other Miis cheer you on from 
the target building. Your Mii will move relative to your center of balance, so 
when your center of balance is off, your Mii will lean too far to one side and 
will start sweating and becoming distressed. You will have to set them right 
before advancing; otherwise they will plummet to Wii oblivion (at least until 
you try again). You will also have to watch out for that iron jaw advancing 
toward you who is hungry for some Mii, as shown in Figure 6-9. Help your 
Mii jump over those jaws by straightening your legs at just the right time. It 
is best to jump when those iron jaws are directly in front of your Mii. Things 
become more challenging on the advanced and expert settings. On the 
advanced setting, your Mii has three iron jaws to jump over and floating bird 
feathers at the start make it difficult to see your Mii on the screen. On the 
expert setting, you will not only have those iron jaws to contend with, but 
also wind gusts that can push you off the rope if you don’t compensate for 
them. The advanced setting becomes available after you complete beginner 
mode and the expert setting becomes available after the advanced setting 
has been completed.

118
Part I: Wii Fit Plus 
 
Figure 6-9:

Scoring: You have two minutes to cross the high wire. The faster you cross 
it, the higher your rating. If you don’t cross it in the allotted time, you 
automatically fall off the rope and your score will be recorded in yards 
instead of time.
Balance Bubble
In this game, your Mii appears in a bubble in a river. Your job is to safely 
navigate your Mii through the course by avoiding the river’s edges and 
staying away from the bees, which are all too happy to burst your Mii’s 
bubble, causing your Mii to plunge into the water, ending the game. If you 
let your Mii get too close to the river banks without correcting course, it 
becomes distressed and starts trembling before the bubble finally pops.
You guide your Mii down the river by leaning forward, backward, left, and 
right on the Balance Board. The farther forward you lean, the faster your Mii 
travels down the river, whereas leaning back slows down your Mii. Leaning 
left and right steers your Mii accordingly. It is best to keep movements more 
subtle and control your speed until you become comfortable with the course, 
as there are some twists and turns to navigate. One way you can avoid the 
bees is to pass them quickly, which is easier to do on the beginner level than 
the advanced one. This game also has an advanced setting, which is unlocked 
after you complete beginner mode. On the advanced level, there are more 
bees, and they seem to be more aggressive — sort of like Africanized bees 
versus honeybees on the beginner level.

119
 Chapter 6: Training Plus and Balance Games
 
When you reach the fork in the river, it is best to veer right, as that path is 
considerably wider than the one on the left. Of course, if you’d like more of a 
challenge, go left to take the narrower and less forgiving course.
Scoring: This game is scored based on time, much like the Tightrope Walk, 
and you are allotted 90 seconds to complete the board. If you run out of time 
or your Mii hits the river’s edge or gets stung by a bee, your Mii’s bubble will 
burst, your score will be recorded in yards, and you will receive a one-star 
rating. If you successfully make it to the mouth of the river, your score will be 
recorded in time.
Penguin Slide
In this fast-paced game, your famished Mii is standing on an iceberg and 
donning a penguin suit. Luckily, the fish are flying! They are literally jumping 
out of the water, just tempting you to eat them. You catch them by quickly 
tilting the iceberg left and right. Like the Ski Jump and Lotus Focus, there 
is no advanced setting to unlock, but this game is challenging enough even 
without one.
You need to shift your body weight left and right to tilt the iceberg in the 
direction necessary to catch the fish. As you tilt the iceberg, your Mii begins 
to slide downward in the direction of the tilt. If you aren’t careful with how 
far you tilt, your Mii will slide off the iceberg completely and you’ll have to 
wait several seconds before your Mii can hop back on again. Staying in the 
center of the iceberg as much as possible prevents your Mii from sliding into 
the icy water and allows you to access fish on both sides of the iceberg more 
easily, ensuring you optimize your fish-catching potential. But keep in mind 
that not all fish are created equal! Be sure to pay close attention to the large 
red fish, as shown in Figure 6-10, because they are quite the catch. Once one 
of these red fish appears beneath the iceberg, take note of which side of the 
iceberg it eventually dives out of sight on, as it will surface shortly thereafter 
above the iceberg on the same side. Catching these red fish is considerably 
more challenging because the iceberg doesn’t tilt high enough for you to 
catch them. You will have to hoist yourself toward them, which you do by 
positioning your Mii below one of these fish on the iceberg and then quickly 
tilting the iceberg in the opposite direction. It takes some practice to be able 
to perform this maneuver consistently, but the extra points are well worth 
the effort.

Scoring: The blue fish are worth one point, the green fish are worth two 
points, and the challenging red fish are worth +points.
Lotus Focus
This game is perhaps the most deceptively simple of all Wii Fit Plus activities. 
Lotus Focus, or Zazen, is a key Zen Buddhist practice, and is essentially the 
act of sitting as still as possible. What differentiates this seated meditation 
movement from the more popular “couch potato” — besides the absence of 
salty snacks — is its focus on concentration. In its Wii Fit Plus form, Lotus 
Focus challenges you to maintain unwavering focus on an onscreen candle — 
the slightest twitch causes air to rush over your candle, possibly extinguishing 
it! If your candle’s flame is snuffed out, so is your game.
Unlike the other balance games, you begin Lotus Focus by sitting on the 
Balance Board with your legs folded and the palms of your hands resting on 
your knees. Be sure your back is straight and you breathe smoothly. Once 
the test begins, you must remain as focused and motionless as possible 
while breathing normally. To make things more difficult, a virtual moth 
will fly about and various sound effects will play at different times to try to 
distract you.
 
Zazen is typically performed with a variety of leg configurations, so feel free to 
experiment with different seated positions.
Scoring: Scoring is all about remaining focused and well balanced for as long 
as possible, up to 180 seconds, at which point you are declared a champion.

T
he original Wii Fit redefined the fitness videogame genre with its unique 
peripheral, the Balance Board, which uses your center of balance to 
track movements. Turn to Chapter 1 for more on the Balance Board and its 
unique capabilities. Although it was widely popular and well-received, Wii 
Fit has shortcomings that later exercise-based games sought to correct. 
Most notably, Wii Fit lacks the capability to continuously stream exercises 
or select a workout routine, which can leave you feeling lost and as though 
you are spending more time navigating menus than actually working out. 
Although this has been addressed with Wii Fit Plus, it doesn’t provide nearly 
as robust a portal for setting and customizing workouts as the vastly popular 
EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer, which lives up to the promise of giving you 
a 20-minute workout. Working out with EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer is 
much like working out with a quality exercise DVD, with the added bonuses 
of having your movements tracked and providing real-time guidance and 
encouragement. As its title suggests, you truly feel as though you have a 
personal trainer at your side. EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer also generates 
new routines based on your goals every time you work out, keeping workouts 
interesting and fresh.
This chapter provides you with all the information you need to get started 
using your EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer. You find out how to assemble, 
use, and care for the tools that come with the program — the Resistance 
Band and Leg Strap. You also discover how to use the software, including 
navigating the menus and calendars, create your Fitness Profile, incorporate 
the Balance Board, and take the 30 Day Challenge.

Exploring What’s in the Box
When you purchase your EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer, you receive the 
software, which features more than 25 different exercises and sports-based 
activities (see Chapter 8 for the complete list); a ribbon-style Resistance 
Band, which you have to assemble (as outlined in the next section); and a 
Leg Strap that comes with an Adjustment Strip, allowing you to adjust the 
size of the strap, if necessary. Figure 7-1 shows the contents of the EA Sports 
Active: Personal Trainer bundle. Try not to feel overwhelmed by the accessories 
in the bundle. They each serve a specific purpose. The Leg Strap remains 
on your leg for all EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer activities, and its sole 
purpose is to house the Wii Nunchuk for exercises that require tracking your 
lower body movements, such as Dancing, Kick-ups/High Knees, and Squats. 
The Resistance Band is used to increase the intensity of many upper body 
exercises, such as upright rows, bicep curls, and both shoulder raises and 
presses. The Resistance Band has a resistance level of .20 mm, which is 
considered very low. If you want to increase your resistance level, you can 
purchase stronger bands. See Chapter 13 for more on Resistance Bands, 
including some options.

 Chapter 7: Getting Started
 
To extend the life of your Resistance Band, which is constructed of very thin 
latex, we recommend storing it in a cool, dry place, such as a sealable bag or 
plastic box with lid, and putting a little baby powder or cornstarch on it 
between uses to prevent moisture buildup.
 
Allergy alert! The Resistance Band is constructed of a natural latex rubber and 
has a powder coating to which small latex particles can attach, so if you have 
a latex allergy, do not open the package. Latex-free alternatives are available. 
Because latex allergies can appear at any time and may worsen with repeated 
exposure, use of the Resistance Band should be discontinued immediately if 
any sensitivity is noticed, as life-threatening reactions, albeit extremely rare, 
are possible. According to the EA Active Web site, the Leg Strap is composed 
of neoprene, a synthetic rubber, and has a natural rubber backing, but no 
latex; however, latex is a natural rubber and caution may still be warranted. 
Neoprene itself can lead to an allergic reaction in some individuals; therefore, 
if you have a neoprene, latex, or other rubber allergy, you should find an 
alternative. This may prove a bit challenging, but some people have reported 
success using stretchy sports sweat headbands, for instance, to keep the Wii 
Nunchuk in place.
Gearing Up
The Resistance Band package contains one red Resistance Band and two 
black straps. Putting these three components together to form one cohesive 
unit is a snap — well, maybe more of a fold and a pull — that takes less than 
a minute. Follow these steps:
 
1. Spread the red Resistance Band out on a smooth, flat surface, such 
as a table or the floor, and take one of the black straps and place it 
under the flattened red band, roughly two to three inches from one 
end of the band.
 
 The big loop of the black strap should be facing you, as shown in 
Figure 7-2.
 
2. Fold the big loop over the red Resistance Band, as shown in 
Figure 7-3.
 
3. Pull the big loop of the black strap through the smaller loop, as shown 
in Figure 7-4, and keep pulling until the resulting knot is tight and 
secure.
 
4. Repeat these steps with the other black strap, and you will be good 
to go.

The Leg Strap is 28 inches wide and comes with a 5-inch adjustment strip. 
The EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer Instruction Booklet refers to this strip 
as a hook and loop fastener, but you are probably more familiar with its trade 
name of Velcro, which we refer to it as throughout the book. The adjustment 
strip can be used to either shorten or extend the strap, the latter of which 
is not discussed in the Instruction Booklet. The Leg Strap works best if you 
wear form-fitting pants or shorts. Loose pants, such as jogging pants, or slick 
fabrics don’t allow the Leg Strap to be tightened enough, making it prone to 
slippage during your workout, which can get quite annoying. Try on the Leg 
Strap to ensure you get a proper fit. Follow these steps:
 
1. Place the Leg Strap around your right leg, with the pouch facing 
forward and the opening of the pouch facing up.
 
 The Leg Strap should be high enough so that it stays put, but not low 
enough to interfere with bending your knees.
 
2. After you’ve found the proper position, bring the ends together and 
thread the long strap through the black plastic buckle, as shown in 
Figure 7-5.
 
 You can thread it through either opening on the plastic buckle, but the 
hook (rough) and loop (soft) sides of the Velcro should be facing each 
other.

128
Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
 
Figure 7-5:

position

Strap.
 
 
3. Pull the long strap until it is snug, but not so tight that you cut off your 
circulation, and secure the Leg Strap by pressing the hook and loop 
sides of the Velcro together.
 
 The Leg Strap should be comfortable upon squatting, and if positioned 
correctly, the pouch will be sitting on top of your thigh when your legs 
are at a 90-degree angle during the squat. If not, loosen the strap and 
readjust until you find the proper position and fit.
Is the Leg Strap too small? You can add up to an additional three inches to it 
by using the Velcro adjustment strip. Follow these steps:
 
1. Spread the Leg Strap out on a flat surface with the pouch facing you.
 
2. Expand the overall length by attaching the loop side of the Velcro 
adjustment strip to the hook side of the Velcro on the Leg Strap.
 
 Placement of the adjustment strip determines how much length you 
gain.
 
3. After placing the Leg Strap in the correct position on your leg, so that 
the pouch is facing forward and the opening of the pouch is facing up, 
thread the Velcro adjustment strip through the black plastic buckle.

129
 Chapter 7: Getting Started
Is the Leg Strap too large? Whip out that Velcro adjustment strip and follow 
these four steps to shorten it:
 
1. Spread the Leg Strap out on a flat surface with the pouch facing you.
 
2. Shorten the overall length by folding a segment of the strap over 
itself, as shown in Figure 7-6.
 
 The amount that is folded is the amount by which the strap is shortened.

Strap being

folding.
 
 
3. Take the Velcro strip and press the hook side firmly down onto the 
loop sides of the Leg Strap so that the strip straddles the folded and 
unfolded segments of the Leg Strap, as shown in Figure 7-7.
 
4. Try the shortened Leg Strap on for size, and if necessary, adjust the 
fold and secure the Velcro strip.

Creating Your Fitness Profile
Although you can proceed directly into your workout by selecting the green 
Guest Pass in the lower-right corner of the Fitness Profile screen, shown in 
Figure 7-8, we recommend that you take a minute to create a fitness profile. 
Establishing a fitness profile is required to track your progress in a fitness 
journal and to participate in the 30 Day Challenge. Setting up a profile takes 
just a few minutes, and you can edit or delete your fitness profile any time. 
You can create up to five fitness profiles, allowing your family or friends to 
get in on the action.
Establishing your Fitness Profile
To create your fitness profile, hover over a Create New card on the main 
menu and press A. Doing this brings you to the Personal Stats screen. Enter 
your gender, age, height, and weight by hovering over the appropriate 
arrows and pressing A or by holding down the A button while hovering over 
the slider in the middle of the scale and moving your Wii Remote left or right 
until the proper value appears in the slider. The minimum and maximum 
values for the stats are:

131
 Chapter 7: Getting Started
 
✓ 5 to 95 years for age
 
✓ 3 to 8 feet for height
 
✓ 30 to 300 pounds for weight
 
Figure 7-8: 
Viewing 
the Fitness 
Profile 
screen.
 
Because this information is used to calculate your projected calorie burn for 
each activity, it is in your best interest to be as accurate as possible. Don’t 
be discouraged if you weigh more than 300 pounds. Although discovering 
this arbitrary weight limitation in the software may be disappointing, it won’t 
impede you from performing the exercises, and getting in a good workout is 
ultimately all that matters. You can even incorporate the Wii Balance Board if 
you weigh up to 330 pounds, which is the weight limit of the Board; however, 
the Balance Board is optional and not using it does not limit the activities 
available to you. When you are satisfied with your personal stats, hover over 
Next and press A. Doing this pulls up an avatar for you to customize.
Customizing your avatar
A male or female avatar appears on the screen, depending on which gender 
was selected on the Personal Stat screen. None of the other information 
entered on that screen will affect your avatar’s looks, unlike Wii Fit Plus, 
which weighs you and shapes your Mii to its best guess. Eight simple steps 
are required to customize your avatar. After you make your selection for 
each category, press Next to go to the next screen. If you decide at any point 
during the customization process that you want to change one or more of 

132
Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
your selections, just click the Back button at the bottom of the screen until 
you get to the screen(s) that you want. Follow these steps to customize your 
avatar:
 
1. Select your avatar’s body type.
 
 You can use the arrows or pull the bar in the middle of the scale to the 
left (for thinner) or to the right (for heavier) to make your selection; 
even the heaviest option does not make for a very heavy looking avatar.
 
2. Select your avatar’s skin color from the six available options.
 
3. Select a hair style.
 
 There are 6 choices for male avatars and 11 for female avatars. You 
can access additional options for female avatars by pressing A while 
hovering over the arrow on the right. If you prefer an option on the first 
screen, click the arrow on the left to get back to it.
 
4. Select one of the six available hair colors.
 
5. Dress your avatar.
 
 There are 18 options for men and 20 for women. Click the arrow on the 
right to scroll through the myriad options and the one on the left to 
access previously displayed options.
 
6. Select a hat.
 
 Eleven are available to choose from. Of course you also have the option 
of resisting temptation and going hatless.
 
7. Choose to go with or without sunglasses.
 
 Five fashionable sunglass options are available.
 
8.  Select your avatar’s sneakers.
 
 Five options are available. No barefoot avatars allowed, so no shoes, no 
service!
Now you can create your Fitness Journal. After your final selection has been 
made, an onscreen keyboard appears. Use the keyboard to enter your name. 
Unless your name is conveniently “Name,” make sure you hover over the 
Backspace button and press A until you’ve deleted all the letters from the 
top window. If you want uppercase letters, hover over Shift and press A. Now 
hover over the letters you need and press A; you can enter a total of ten 
characters. After your name has been entered, select OK. Congratulations! 
You now have your very own Fitness Journal!

133
 Chapter 7: Getting Started
Editing your Fitness Profile
You can edit or delete a fitness profile any time. Just go to the main menu 
and select Fitness Profile. Then click on the profile you wish to edit. Doing 
this opens the screen containing your fitness profile. This screen has four 
options. The last two options are Edit Fitness Profile and Delete Fitness 
Profile. If you select the latter, you are asked to confirm this decision. Should 
you select Yes, the profile is history. If you choose to edit your profile 
instead, you go through the same menu that you went through to establish 
the profile, including the Personal Stats screen and each of the eight avatar 
customization screens. After you finish making your modifications, which 
concludes with the shoe selection, your changes are automatically saved 
and you are transported back to your fitness profile — no clicking of heels 
needed.
Earning trophies
You can earn a total of 30 trophies in EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer. The 
trophies are outlined in Table 7-1. Trophies are awarded to celebrate your 
achievements and milestones, and can be accessed through your fitness 
profile by selecting View My Trophies.

Keeping Your Fitness Journal
The Fitness Journal is used to track your workout progress. The Fitness 
Journal main page, shown in Figure 7-10, shows your daily checklist, medals 
achieved for the day, and trainer feedback. You can also access your goals, 
profile, and calendar. In the following sections, we examine each of these 
Journal components more closely.
 
Figure 7-10: 
The Fitness 
Journal 
main menu.
 
The Checklist
The Checklist includes three items: EA Sports Active Workouts, the Lifestyle 
& Nutrition Survey, and the Other Activity Survey. To have all three checked 
off in your Fitness Journal for the day, you need to complete a workout and 
both surveys. Selecting EA Sports Active Workouts allows you to choose 
a workout to complete. You can select one from your 30 Day Challenge or 
a preset or custom workout. The custom workout option is only available 
to you after you’ve created your own routine. We discuss how to do this in 
Chapter 9. After you complete your workout, EA Sports Active Workouts are 
checked off for the day.
The Lifestyle & Nutrition Survey asks you ten questions about how well you 
are taking care of yourself outside of EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer and 
gives you trainer tips. For example, you are asked how many sugar-containing 
drinks you consumed the day before, how stressed you are currently feeling, 
and how many hours of quality, uninterrupted sleep you received. To answer 
these and other questions, click on the + or – signs on the left-hand page to 
make your selection and press Next when you are satisfied with your answer. 

137
 Chapter 7: Getting Started
When you complete the survey, your answers are displayed on the left and 
trainer tips based on your responses appear on the right, as shown in 
Figure 7-11. You also see a Graph option on the bottom of the left-hand page 
of your Fitness Journal. If you select it, you see a monthly graph that plots 
out your answers to the lifestyle factors that you were queried on as well as 
what your goals should be based on the trainer tips provided. There are a 
total of ten graphs, one for each question, so you have to click the arrows 
on the bottom of the graph to scroll through to see them all. You can also 
opt to see a weekly graph by clicking the Weekly Graph button in the 
lower-right corner of the graph. If you click that button again, it reverts back 
to the monthly graph. To exit the graph screen, select the Close X tab in 
the upper-right corner. Doing this brings you back to your survey results. If 
you are finished with this page, click Done. Your results are saved and the 
Lifestyle & Nutrition Survey is checked off.
 
Figure 7-11: 
A completed 
Lifestyle & 
Nutrition 
Survey.
 
Through the Other Activity Survey, EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer rewards 
you for physical activities performed outside of the program, whether they 
are sports-based or regular daily activities, such as yard work. After you 
select the Other Activity Survey from your Fitness Journal’s main menu, you 
come to a screen where there are three physical activity tips and instructions 
on the left and Graph and Add Activities options on the right. If you select 
Add Activities, you come to a screen where you can choose from 15 activities, 
which you have to scroll through by clicking the up and down arrows or 
dragging the slider up and down, as shown in Figure 7-12. After you find an 
activity you want to add, click on it. This brings you to a screen that asks you 
how much time you spent doing the activity and to rate your intensity level. 
Activity time is added in five-minute increments. Make your selections by 
pressing the + and – signs. The right-hand page for each selected activity 
contains a definition of the activity and/or an explanation of its general 

138
Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
intensity level. You can add numerous activities to the survey, and you will 
see Total Time and the Average Intensity for all activities you have added 
to the activity selection menu. After you’ve added all your activities, click 
Submit. This step brings you back to your Fitness Journal’s main menu. As 
with the Lifestyle & Nutrition Survey, if you select Graph, you can see your 
activities plotted out and can select between a Weekly and Monthly Graph.

Daily medals
Each day that you use your Fitness Journal, you are awarded a gold, silver, 
or bronze medal, depending on your performance during the workout, 
your responses to the daily Lifestyle & Nutrition survey, and your reported 
activity levels outside of EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer. At the bottom of 
the Fitness Journal screen, notice the countdown timer. Fortunately, after 
this time lapses, your EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer will not self-destruct, 
but you will have run out of time to complete your workout. This means you 
will receive no medal or whatever medal was obtained by completing one or 
both of the surveys. Generally, doing the workout first is best. The surveys 
can be completed later without penalty, allowing you to get a gold medal 
even after time runs out. Also, although you won’t receive a medal on days 
that none of the items on your checklist is completed, you can still receive a 
gold medal on designated rest days as long as you complete the surveys.
 
If you click on your daily medal, you can get an overview of your Journal Stats, 
including your current age, height, weight, calories burned, average activity 
level, total workout time for the day, average daily rating for medals (bronze, 
silver, or gold), and average health rating.

139
 Chapter 7: Getting Started
Goals, Profile, and Calendars
EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer allows you to set the following three goals:
 
✓ Calories sets how many calories you’d like to burn over a certain period 
of time (500 calories in seven days, for example).
 
✓ Hours sets how many hours you’d like to work out over a designated 
period of time (such as ten hours over 17 days).
 
✓ Workout sets how many workouts you’d like to complete over a certain 
period of time (five workouts over seven days, for example).
You can select goals for all three, some, or none. As long as your Fitness 
Profile is active, these goals can be tracked in any area, and EA Sports Active: 
Personal Trainer can give you feedback on whether you are achieving your 
goals. If you find that your goals were too easy or overly ambitious, you can 
reset or delete them at any time. Just click on My Goals in the lower left of 
the right-hand page of your Fitness Journal, select the goal you want to reset 
or delete, and then follow the prompt to make your selection.
When you select Profile from the Fitness Journal menu, you have three 
options: View My Trophies; Edit Fitness Profile; and Delete Fitness Profile. 
Each of these options is discussed in detail earlier in this chapter.
Your Fitness Journal Calendar pulls up a monthly calendar that shows your 
workout history, medal history, and rest days. For detailed information on 
a particular day, click on the day you want to see. Doing this pulls up your 
Fitness Journal entry for that day. You can scroll through the days before and 
after it by clicking on the Last Day or Next Day tabs at the top of the screen.
Working Out
Now that you’ve created your Fitness Profile and familiarized yourself with 
the main menu and Fitness Journal, it’s time to start working out. You can 
choose between the 30 Day Challenge, or single session Preset & Custom 
Workouts with or without a friend.
As shown in Figure 7-13, there are three basic elements to a single player 
workout screen. In the upper left is calories burned so far. To the upper right 
is the current length of the workout. In the middle is trainer feedback. Finally, 
depending upon the exercise, you may also see an exercise guide/indicator 
to the left of your avatar and the trainer to the right showing you what to do 
next.

30 Day Challenge
The 30 Day Challenge is a great way to help you set a goal and structure 
a realistic timeline to achieve it. As you improve with each workout, EA 
Sports Active: Personal Trainer adapts to keep both the challenge and your 
motivation level high. New workouts are prepared each day, made up of 
various exercises that are tailored to the intensity level of your choosing. Of 
course, as is the hallmark of any good workout program, body parts worked 
are rotated, and rest days are strategically placed throughout your 30 Day 
Challenge’s calendar, as shown in the Weekly Calendar View in Figure 7-15.

The Weekly Calendar View is the main screen for your 30 Day Challenge. You 
can see what days you have to work out, what days you should rest, and 
whether you missed a day. Your trainer provides a summary for each day’s 
activities. You can select Workout to begin that day’s activities, or go back 
and play a previous day’s activities. Selecting Calendar gives you a longer 
view of your workout history and schedule up to your Finish Day, which is 30 
days from your start date, though you can keep playing the increasingly 
misnamed 30 Day Challenge up until day 90, at which point the Challenge 
must be restarted.

142
Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
The first day you begin a new workout during the 30 Day Challenge, you will 
be prompted to choose one of three intensity levels (low, medium, or high), 
whether you wish to use the Wii Balance Board, and what type of music you 
want to listen to.
 
The choice of intensity level appears only the first time you start your first 
workout in a 30 Day Challenge, so we recommend that you set your first 30 
Day Challenge to Low intensity, which still provides for some tough workouts. 
After you finish your first 30 Day Challenge, you can consider moving up to the 
Medium intensity level if you feel you are ready for it.
 
Upon successfully completing a 30 Day Challenge, you can go to 
EA’s official Web site, http://www.easportsactive.com/blog.
action?month=7&year=2,009, and get a 30 Day Challenge badge that you 
can proudly display on your favorite social-networking or other Web site. 
While there, you can also check out other fun activities related to the 30 Day 
Challenge and EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer in general.
Preset & Custom Workouts
Don’t feel like tackling a complete 30 Day Challenge or want to do something 
completely different on a particular day, like playing only your favorite 
exercises and activities? Selecting Preset & Custom Workouts from the main 
menu allows you to create, save, and access your own Custom Workouts, 
or choose from a selection of preset workouts designed around a particular 
goal. See Chapter 8 for a thorough description of each of the exercises, and 
Chapter 9 for more on creating your own Custom Workouts and routines.
Using Help & Settings
Have a regret about something you set in the 30 Day Challenge and want to 
change it? Want to see video of one of the exercises in action? You can do 
all this and more from the Info menu, which appears after selecting Help & 
Settings from the main menu. The options are: Settings, Tutorial Videos, Wii 
Balance Board Check, Credits, and Back.
Selecting Tutorial Videos brings up a selection of every EA Sports Active: 
Personal Trainer exercise activity as demonstrated by either the selected 
male or female trainer, and its corresponding summary information. Credits 
shows a list of the many talented individuals who made EA Sports Active: 
Personal Trainer possible. Back returns you to the main menu. Settings and 
Wii Balance Board Check are described in the next sections.

Selecting Settings from Help & Settings reveals four options: Workout 
Settings, Audio Settings, Create My Playlist, and Back, the latter of which 
returns you to the preceding menu option. Selecting Workout Settings allows 
you to turn Wii Balance Board support on or off, your Personal Trainer to 
Male or Female, and the game’s Measurement Units to Metric or Imperial. 
Audio Settings allows you to change Music Volume, sound effects volume, 
and your Playlist options: All Songs, Modern Beats, Guitars & Alternative, 
Custom, Electronica, Dance Club, and Hip Hop & Urban. Audio Settings 
also features a second tab for Trainer Settings, which changes their Speech 
Volume and how much, if any, feedback they provide. Create My Playlist 
allows you to customize what music you hear from the 41 available tracks.
Wii Balance Board
Selecting Wii Balance Board Check allows you to verify the normal operating 
status of your Balance Board. If your Balance Board has not already been 
synced to your Wii, you must do that before proceeding. Follow the onscreen 
instructions or refer to Chapter 1 for more information on setting up the 
Balance Board with your console.
 
Use of the Balance Board is optional and provides alternative ways to perform 
certain exercises and activities. Unfortunately, due to the technical limitations 
of the board, it is not available in the multiplayer portion of the game.
Getting Fit with a Friend
Although the original Wii Fit kicked off the Wii fitness phenomenon, it 
certainly wasn’t perfect, with one of its biggest omissions being a lack of 
multiplayer support beyond its running games. Among the many ways EA 
Sports Active: Personal Trainer distinguishes itself from the competition is by 
allowing you to perform all its exercises with a friend. To select this mode, 
go to the Preset & Custom Workout screen via the main menu and select 
Workout with a Friend. After you adjust the settings to your liking and begin, 
a split-screen view displays your avatar and friend’s working out side-by-side, 
with your respective trainers showing what to do next. This mode is a great 
way to find that little bit of extra motivation to power through that day’s 
workout as you and your friend compete not only for individual goals, but to 
contribute to your team goal.

Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
You will need a second Wii Remote and Nunchuk, as well as an EA Sports 
Active: Accessory Pack, or equivalent, to be able to perform all the exercises 
and activities. So grab the pack and a friend and get to it!

ith more than 25 exercises, EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
provides a multitude of workout options. If you become bored with 
following a regular workout routine, then you can give the program’s sports 
drills a try, which include fun activities such as dancing, volleyball, and 
baseball. Regardless of which activities you choose, you are guaranteed to 
break a sweat while still having fun, and you may just forget that you are 
working out.
This chapter provides an overview of all the exercises that are available in EA 
Sports Active: Personal Trainer. We’ve broken them out by upper body, lower 
body, cardio, and sports drills, allowing you to easily find exercises to target 
specific body parts and goals. Although this chapter provides guidance on 
how to perform each activity, EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer lets you 
watch a video demonstration of each exercise before undertaking it, ensuring 
that you never feel lost. In this chapter, you discover all that EA Sports Active: 
Personal Trainer has to offer.
Working Your Upper Body
The upper body exercises focus on your back, shoulders, arms, chest, 
and abdominals. For these exercises, you use the Resistance Band, which 
provides a bit of tension, forcing your muscles to work just a little bit harder. 
Exercising your upper body increases strength, improves posture, ensures 

146
Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
mobility of the joints, and builds bone density — all of which become especially 
important as you age. Plus, the work you put into sculpting your upper body 
won’t go unnoticed, because these gains are often the most visible.
 
To ensure the optimal and safe performance of several exercises, you have to 
become familiar with the Standing Hip Hinge position. To achieve this position, 
stand on one foot and bring your other knee upward. Place your fingers in 
your hip crease. After you bring your knee down, stand with your feet shoulder-
width apart and place your hands on your hips with your thumbs forward. 
Squeeze your elbows together to open your chest. Hold this position and bend 
forward, pushing your tailbone away from your chin. Keep your shins vertical 
and look straight ahead. As with all the exercises in this chapter, you can refer 
to the EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer tutorial video under the Help & 
Settings menu on the Standing Hip Hinge to see this technique in action.
Alternating Bicep Curls
This exercise primarily works the bicep muscle of each arm. To get your 
biceps pumped, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent, 
with the Resistance Band under the arches of both feet and a handle 
in each hand.
 
 The Wii Remote should be in your right hand and the Nunchuk in your 
left.
 
2. Place your hands at your sides and hold the handles with your palms 
facing forward.
 
3. Curl your right hand up in a semicircular motion until your forearm 
touches your biceps, keeping your elbows immobile and close to your 
sides at all times.
 
 As shown in Figure 8-1, actively contract your biceps at the top of the 
movement, making sure not to bend your wrist.
 
4. Lower your hand to the starting position and then curl up with your 
left hand.
 
 Repeat the sequence for the indicated number of repetitions.

Working Your Lower Body
The lower body exercises focus on your gluteal and leg muscles. For these 
exercises, you place the Nunchuk in the pocket on the Leg Strap, which 
allows your leg movements to be tracked. Although the work you put into 
your lower body may not be as readily apparent to others, this area should 
not be neglected; otherwise, your body may end up looking out of proportion. 
Working your lower body also helps improve balance, which can go a long 
way in preventing any injuries from unstable footing.
Alternating High Knee Reverse Lunges
This exercise not only places stress on the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, 
but also requires a great deal of balance and coordination. Follow these steps:

Standing Twists
Standing Twists are among the least challenging exercises, which make them 
good for warming up, helping to space out difficult exercises, or simply for 
increasing flexibility. Despite its relative simplicity, as with all exercises, care 
must be taken to perform this movement in a controlled and deliberate manner 
to minimize the risk of injury. Get to twisting by following these steps:
 
1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent, 
with the Wii Remote in your right hand and the Nunchuk in your left.
 
2. Extend your arms in front of your body at shoulder height, keeping 
them parallel to the floor.
 
3. Twist your torso, carefully accelerating through the movement while 
keeping your arms steady.
 
4. Pause briefly before accelerating in the opposite direction.
 
 Be sure to turn your torso as a unit, never allowing your arms to get 
ahead of you. Repeat for the required number of repetitions.

 Chapter 8: Performing the Exercises
Increasing Your Heart Rate with Cardio
Cardiovascular exercises are important to preserve heart and lung function. 
These activities can help burn body fat, lower blood pressure, and improve 
your cholesterol profile by increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol levels. It is thought that HDL transports cholesterol to the liver, 
where it is passed from the body rather than dangerously building up in the 
blood vessels. Although the breathlessness and repetitive motions of cardio 
for extended periods of time may be off-putting to some, EA Sports Active: 
Personal Trainer makes cardio fun by engaging your mind. The activities 
are easy to follow and enable you to take them at your own pace, helping to 
ensure you stick with your fitness program.
Cardio Boxing
EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer offers two Cardio Boxing activities: Heavy 
Bag and Punching Targets. These activities work your cardiovascular system 
while conditioning your upper body, especially your arms and shoulders, and 
require you to punch targets using a variety of combinations, including 
straight punches, crossover punches, and heavy bag punches. As you 
become more experienced, the combinations become more complex. Be sure 
to keep your legs shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent for these 
activities. You hold the Wii Remote in your right hand and Nunchuk in the 
left. A typical boxing screen is shown in Figure 8-14.
 
While you needn’t move your feet during these activities, you can burn more 
calories and get a better cardiovascular workout if you mimic the foot 
movement of actual boxers. To do this, stay on the balls of your feet and bob 
up, down, left, and right when throwing punches.
Heavy Bag
This activity focuses on developing speed and force, and you will have to 
dole punches quickly to reach the target. Be sure to fully extend your arms 
with each punch to get the most out of this exercise. After you hit the target 
the required number of times, the heavy bag becomes unhinged if you’ve 
delivered enough punishment, so don’t hesitate to blow off some steam when 
engaging in this activity.

Targets.
 
Punching Targets
As its name implies, this activity requires you to punch targets as they 
appear, and you use straight punches and crossover punches. For the 
straight punches, hit the red targets straight on with the correct hand so that 
your arm is extended directly in front of you at roughly shoulder height. To 
perform crossover punches, hit the blue targets by punching across your 
body with the opposite hand. Left targets will be hit with your right hand and 
right targets with your left hand. Your arm should extend across your body 
at roughly shoulder height. To put force behind both straight and crossover 
punches, snap at your elbow at the end of the swing. If you deliver enough 
force with your punches, the targets will break. Demolishing the targets is fun 
and an indication that you are working at a higher intensity level, ensuring 
you are maximizing the benefits of this activity.
Wii Balance Board
When you use the Balance Board to do Cardio Boxing, the activity also 
involves your legs, making the activity more like Kick Boxing. When the 
activity starts, you should be standing on the board with your feet shoulder-
width apart and knees slightly bent. The activity combines kicks and knee 
strikes with punches on the heavy bag. When kicking the heavy bag, kick out 
with your right or left foot. Be sure to pull your leg up high with each kick to 
maximize the workout, and return your foot fully to the board after each kick. 
To do knee strikes, raise your right or left leg knee high to strike the bag. Pull 
your knee up high with each kick to maximize the benefit.

169
 Chapter 8: Performing the Exercises
Cardio Dancing
These activities could be described as a DanceDanceRevolution for the arms, 
as you will have to perform several arm movements in time to the beat of the 
music by following the directional arrows as they fall into the green zone on 
the screen, as shown in Figure 8-15. The Cardio Dancing activities are short, 
consisting of 56 moves total, regardless of which level is undertaken. In the 
middle of these dance sequences, you encounter a specialty move, such as 
Do the Shopping Cart, Start that Lawnmower, or Wave the Lasso. You won’t 
be following directional arrows for these sequences, just mimicking the 
movements of your onscreen classmates, and the movements will be straight-
forward. While you aren’t required to move your feet for Cardio Dancing, you 
will find these activities much easier to perform if you bounce with the beat 
of the music. For stability, be sure to keep your feet shoulder-width apart and 
your knees slightly bent.

Wii Balance Board
When you use the Balance Board to do Cardio Dancing, the activity also 
involves your legs, and you will be stepping on and off the board while also 
moving your arms. When the activity starts, you should be standing on the 
board with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. Watch the 
onscreen indicators, which help you keep up with the cardio dance moves. 
Try to keep beat with the music and the background dancers.

Track
Running around a track dates back to the ancient Greeks and was the only 
event at the Olympics in 776 BCE, which is the first Olympics for which we 
have a written record. Since then, track and field activities, also commonly 
referred to as athletics, have evolved considerably. EA Sports Active: Personal 
Trainer has numerous track-based activities, including High Knees, Kick Ups, 
running, and walking. You can use the walking activity to warm up or cool 
down, and if you are looking for a more intense activity, give running, High 
Knees, or Kick Ups a try. A typical track screen is shown in Figure 8-16.
 
Figure 8-16:
 A typical 
track 
screen.
 
High Knees
When you do High Knees, bring your knees up high enough when you raise 
each leg so that your thigh is parallel with the ground. Be sure to maintain 
your posture by keeping your back straight and shoulders back. It will look 
like you are marching in place. If you want to be a true fitness soldier, be sure 
to pump your arms.
Kick Ups
When you do Kick Ups, keep your steps light and stay on the balls of your 
feet. Each time you raise a leg, drive your heel back toward your glutes. If you 
are doing this correctly, your leg may lightly kick the back of your thighs. For 
maximum benefit, pump those arms, which burns more calories and helps 
improve your balance and posture.

171
 Chapter 8: Performing the Exercises
Running
When running, be sure to lean forward slightly. Doing this places your 
center of mass on the front part of your foot, facilitating your foot’s spring 
mechanism. Be sure to pump your arms as well. Upper body motions 
compensate for the motions of the lower body and are important for 
keeping the body in rotational balance. The more force you exert with your 
lower body, the more exaggerated your arm pumping should be to keep this 
balance.
Walking
When you are told to walk, gently walk in place. You will see the characters 
walk onscreen, so you will know that you are doing the right movement. Be 
sure to swing those arms!
Having Fun with Sports
Sports are a great way to work out. The sports-based drills in EA Sports 
Active: Personal Trainer target both upper and lower body muscle groups, 
and many of the activities give you a solid cardiovascular workout. Even 
if you’ve never played sports, don’t hesitate to give these drills a try. Who 
knows, they may just inspire you to try your hand at the real thing.
Baseball
On the virtual baseball diamond, you perform several reflex-oriented activities, 
including swinging a bat, and catching and throwing a ball, all designed to 
challenge your upper body. Most of the movements are performed with the 
Wii Remote in your right hand and the Nunchuk in your left, though you can 
incorporate more lower body work and increase the challenge through the 
use of the Balance Board. An example of a typical Baseball screen is shown in 
Figure 8-17.
Batting
To bat, hold the Wii Remote in your hand and swing when you see the ball 
being pitched toward you. Hitting the ball with enough power gives you a 
home run, while hitting the ball lightly with give you an infield hit. For greater 
effect, twist your body into the ball as you swing.

172
Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer

Catching
To catch, you need to move the Nunchuk in the direction that the ball is 
going as it travels toward you. To catch a ball on the left or right, swing the 
Nunchuk in that direction. To catch a pop fly or grounder, hold the Nunchuk 
up or down, respectively. After you’ve caught the ball, swing the Wii Remote 
to throw the ball toward the target. Swinging the Wii Remote harder for each 
throw provides a greater workout benefit.
Pitching
To pitch, swing the Wii Remote forward in a throwing motion. Swinging 
harder provides a greater workout benefit.
Wii Balance Board
When you use the Balance Board while playing Baseball, only how you catch 
the ball will change. When the sequence involving catching starts, you should 
be standing on the board with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees 
slightly bent. To catch a ball on the left, step off to the left and swing the 
Nunchuk to the left. Reverse for a ball on the right. After you’ve caught a ball, 
keep both feet on the board while you swing the Wii Remote to throw the ball 
toward the target.

173
 Chapter 8: Performing the Exercises
Basketball
On the virtual basketball court, you perform two different activities involving the 
ball: passing and shooting. These are both considered upper body activities, 
though you can put more of your body into each pass and shot to greatly 
enhance the experience. You can also incorporate more lower body work and 
increase the challenge through the use of the Balance Board, though most of 
the movements are performed with the Wii Remote in your right hand and 
the Nunchuk in your left. An example of a typical Basketball screen is shown 
in Figure 8-18.
 
Figure 8-18:

Passing.
 
Passing
To pass, first pick up a ball from the rack by swinging your arms to the left. 
When you have a ball, you’re ready to pass. Push both hands forward with 
your elbows pointing out, using enough power to knock the target backward. 
Using more power for each pass provides a greater workout benefit.
Shooting
To shoot, first pick up a ball from the rack by swinging your arms to the left. 
After you have a ball, you’re ready to shoot. Push both hands forward like 
you’re shooting the ball toward the net. Using more power as you shoot 
provides a greater workout benefit and helps the ball reach the basket. The 
key to success here is getting into a good rhythm.

174
Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
Wii Balance Board
When you use the Balance Board while playing Basketball, only passing the 
ball changes. When the sequence involving passing starts, you should be 
standing on the board with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly 
bent. Pick up a ball off the rack by swinging your arms to the left. After you 
have a ball, aim at the target. To aim at the left target, take a step to the left 
with your foot. Reverse for the right target. To pass, push both hands forward 
with your elbows pointed out.
In-line Skating
Of all the sports activities in EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer, only In-line 
Skating (better known from the Nordica company trademark, Rollerblade) is 
designed to specifically target your lower body through a series of demanding 
squats and jumps. A lower impact effect can be achieved through use of the 
Balance Board. Even if you’ve never touched a pair of skates in your life, 
you’ll be crouching for speed and jumping off ramps as you navigate around 
the virtual track, shown in Figure 8-19, in no time at all.
 
Figure 8-19: 
A typical 
In-line 
Skating 
screen sans

Board.
 
To skate, you do a combination of squats and jumps. Place the Wii Remote 
in your right hand and the Nunchuk in the Leg Strap around your upper-right 
thigh. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. 
Squatting will increase the speed with which you move down the track; thus, 
the lower you squat, the faster you will go, and the higher, the slower. When 
you come to the end of a ramp, jump up. Try to land softly and evenly with 
both feet and a slight bend in your knees to cushion the impact.

175
 Chapter 8: Performing the Exercises
Wii Balance Board
When you use the Balance Board for In-line Skating, no jumping is involved, 
because doing so can damage the board. Stand on the board with your feet 
shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. When you squat, you 
increase speed as you move down the track. The lower you squat, the faster 
you will go, and the higher, the slower. Instead of jumping, you’ll be lifting 
your left or right leg in time to dodge hay bales on the track. If you fail to lift 
your leg over the bales, you will slow down.
Tennis
On the virtual tennis court, you work your upper body with volleys, ground-
strokes, and overhead smashes. Most of the movements are performed with 
the Wii Remote in your right hand and the Nunchuk in your left, though you 
can incorporate more lower body work and increase the challenge through 
the use of the Balance Board. A typical Tennis screen is shown in Figure 8-20.

Backhand
To do a backhand, quickly swing toward and through the ball. Rotate your 
shoulders and upper torso with the swing to get good full-body motion. 
Follow through by swinging across the body for the full range of the swing.
Backhand volley
For backhand volleys, raise the Wii Remote to about shoulder height. Bring 
your arms slightly across your body and behind. When the ball comes into 

176
Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
position, quickly swing toward and through the ball. Your swings should be 
quick, short, and powerful.
Forehand
For a forehand shot, quickly swing forward through the ball. Rotate your 
shoulders and upper torso with the swing to get good full-body motion, 
following through by swinging across your body.
Forehand volley
When you’re up close to the net, you volley. For the Forehand volley, raise 
the Wii Remote to about shoulder height. Bring your arms slightly back and 
behind you. When the ball comes into position, quickly swing through the 
ball.
Overhead Smash
When it’s time to do overhead smashes, you see the ball launched high, as 
if it’s going to go over your head. To hit these balls correctly, hold the Wii 
Remote slightly behind your head and over your shoulder. When the ball 
arrives, swing upward through its path, reaching as high as you can. Follow 
through completely to achieve a full range of motion. Your swinging hand 
should end on the opposite side of your body, below your shoulders, about 
the same height as your waist. Return to the ready position to prepare for the 
next ball.
Wii Balance Board
When you use the Balance Board while playing Tennis, only how you do 
backcourt forehands and backhands changes. When a sequence involving 
forehands or backhands starts, you should be standing on the board with 
your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. If the ball is traveling to 
your right, step off the board with your right foot and swing the Wii Remote 
in a forehand stroke motion. After you’ve made your stroke, return your foot 
to the board. If the ball is traveling to your left, step off the board with your 
left foot and swing the Wii Remote in a backhand stroke motion. After you 
have made your stroke, return your foot to the board.
Volleyball
In Volleyball, you’ll be on the virtual volleyball court targeting your upper 
body with bumping, setting, serving, and blocking, all without the risk of 
getting sand in your shorts. Although most of the movements are performed 
with the Wii Remote in your right hand and the Nunchuk in your left, you can 
put more of your body into each move and incorporate the Balance Board to 
enhance the experience, particularly for your lower body. A typical Volleyball 
screen is shown in Figure 8-21.

Blocking
For blocking, bend your knees and keep your weight forward on the balls of 
your feet. Hold the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in front of your face. When the 
ball comes in range, jump into the air and push your hands up as high as you 
can to hit the ball back over the net.
Bumping
To bump, hold the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in front of you at waist height 
so they are touching. Bend your knees and keep your weight forward on the 
balls of your feet. When the ball is in range, straighten your legs and make a 
short swing upward with your arms.
Serving
To serve, keep your left hand at waist height and hold your right hand behind 
and to the right of your head. With your left hand, throw the ball up in the 
air by moving the Nunchuk sharply upward. As the ball starts to come back 
down, swing the Wii Remote downward to drive the ball over the net.
Setting
To set, hold your hands a few inches above and in front of your head so you 
can see them. Face your palms upward. When the ball is within range, push 
up with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to set the ball.

178
Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
Wii Balance Board
When you use the Balance Board while playing Volleyball, only how you do 
bumping and setting will change. When a sequence involving bumping or 
setting starts, you should be standing on the board with your feet shoulder-
width apart and knees slightly bent. To bump, hold the Wii Remote and 
Nunchuk in front of you at waist height so they are touching. The ball will fall 
on either your left or right side. Step off the board to the side with the foot 
that the ball is falling toward and make a short swing upward to return the 
ball. To set, hold your hands a few inches above and in front of your head 
where you can see them. Face your palms upward. The ball will fall on either 
your left or right side. Step off the board in a lunge position to the side with 
the foot that the ball is falling toward and push up with the Wii Remote and 
Nunchuk to set the ball.

espite countless claims made on magazine covers, late-night infomercials, 
and advertisements for supplements and fitness products, no “quick 
fix” exists when it comes to losing weight and getting in shape. Of course, 
exercise has numerous benefits, which you reap along the way, such as 
improved joint flexibility and reduced stress levels. Although patience and 
determination are essential in any quest to whip your body into the best 
shape possible, working out with routines that keep you engaged is equally 
important. When a routine stops being challenging, your muscles stop 
responding, leaving you at risk of throwing in the towel. EA Sports Active: 
Personal Trainer offers an abundance of workout regimens that contain a 
multitude of activities, including cardio, upper and lower body exercises, 
and sports-based drills, ensuring your workouts remain interesting and 
challenging. You also have the flexibility to create your own workouts or 
customize a preset routine.
In this chapter, we give you an overview of the EA Sports Active: Personal 
Trainer preset workouts. You also discover how you can create your own 
workouts or edit an existing one and learn how to assess your results and 
progress. We also provide you with a few routines that you can try. As you 
can see, this game has no shortage of workout options or activities from 
which you can choose. We begin by examining the preset routines.

Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
Choosing From Preset Workouts
From the Main Menu, select Preset & Custom Workouts and then decide if 
you want to work out on your own or with a friend. If you choose to go solo, 
you have access to a wide range of workouts, including selections from the 30 
Day Challenge. If you have previously selected the Wii Balance Board option 
for your profile, board-enabled exercises will replace certain exercises in 
the various preset workouts. The board option can be turned on or off from 
the Choose Workout screen by selecting the Wii Balance Board button in the 
lower-right corner, as shown in Figure 9-1. If you choose to work out with a 
friend, you will not be able to use the Balance Board, but a range of cooperative 
workouts is available in addition to selections from the 30 Day Challenge.
 
Figure 9-1:

In the typical exercise list, like the one shown in Figure 9-2, you can see the 
list of exercises under the Preset Workouts tab. Each workout option gives 
total time to completion if all exercises are selected and performed, what the 
workout is called, along with a Practice, Easy, Medium, or Hard descriptor 
to let you select your desired challenge level, and a slightly more detailed 
description, in red, of what the workout consists of.
After selecting the workout of your choice, the Today’s Exercises screen 
appears, shown in Figure 9-2, which lists all the activities. The green check 
mark indicates that you will perform that exercise during the workout. If you 
see an exercise you’d rather not perform, or you wish to modify the time 
to completion or Calorie Target, you can click on an exercise to change the 
green check mark to a red x. Be sure you look at all the exercises in a 
particular workout by clicking through to the next page, as applicable, before 
clicking Continue.

Developing a Custom Workout
One of the most powerful features of EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer is its 
capability to allow you to create your own workout routines. Although there 
are enough preset workouts to keep you busy indefinitely, none of these may 
be tuned to your specific needs or preferences. Luckily, creating a custom 
workout in one of the four available slots is a relatively quick and intuitive 
process. It’s also easy to edit a previously created custom workout or delete 
it entirely.
EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer gives you a wide range of exercises at three 
different skill levels in four different categories to choose from as you create 
your routine (for more on the exercises, refer to Chapter 8). Each skill level 
has differing difficulty and completion times and also provides a calorie burn 
estimate based on your bodyweight. Table 9-1 lists the Cardio exercises, 
Table 9-2 lists the Upper Body exercises, Table 9-3 lists the Lower Body 
exercises, and Table 9-4 lists the Sports exercises. Note that the Wii Balance 
Board exercises are not an option if you indicate you don’t have a board or 
you choose to work out with a friend.

A harried schedule may make it easier for you to undertake two workouts in 
a day that are 15 minutes or less than one longer workout. If this is the case, 
consider creating mini routines for yourself that you can perform as time 
permits. Ideally, your mini routines focus on one half of your body, rather than 
including a mix of upper and lower body exercises.
Now try to create your first routine!
Creating your routine
Being able to create your own routines gives you a lot of flexibility with your 
workouts. It allows you to add variety to your workout, incorporate exercises 
that you enjoy or find challenging, or to target specific areas of your body. 
Follow these steps to create your own workout in EA Sports Active: Personal 
Trainer:
 
1. From the Main Menu, select Preset & Custom Workouts and then 
decide if you want to work out on your own or with a friend, each of 
which has his or her own set of four custom workout slots.
 
 If you select single player and have previously selected the Wii Balance 
Board option for your profile, board-enabled exercises will be available. 

187
 Chapter 9: Getting Active with the Routines
The board option also can be turned on or off from the Choose Workout 
screen by selecting the Wii Balance Board button in the lower-right 
corner (refer to Figure 9-1). If this is the first time you’re creating a 
custom workout, you see the Create Your First Workout! button, which 
brings you to the Create My Workout screen, as shown in Figure 9-4.
 
Figure 9-4: 
The Create 
My Workout 
screen, with 
the Cardio, 
Upper, 
Lower, and 
Sports tabs.
 
 
2. Add an exercise from one of the four onscreen tabs — Cardio, Upper, 
Lower, and Sports — by clicking on the exercise icon.
 
 Refer to Tables 9-1 through 9-4 for the exercises that are available for 
each option. You can also drag and drop an exercise onto the list by 
clicking on its exercise icon and dragging it down to the list area while 
holding the A button, and then releasing it. When more than one 
exercise is in the list, you can drag and drop the exercises within the 
list to reorder them.
 
3. After an exercise has been placed onto the list, you can change its 
default Medium difficulty by hovering the pointer over the icon until 
a selector appears, and either clicking the up arrow for Hard or the 
down arrow for Easy.
 
 You can also change every exercise’s difficulty on the list by pressing 
+, for more difficulty, or –, for less difficultly, in the Overall Challenge 
area toward the bottom of the screen. Clicking on an exercise in the list 
area removes it from the sequence. Each time you add a new exercise, 
the amount of projected calories burned and amount of time required 
to do the workout increase. You can also see the percentage focus on 
cardio, upper and lower body change via the indicators in the lower left. 
Generally speaking, the percentages only change if you mix in exercises 
from the different tabs.

188
Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
 
 Your body has finite recovery abilities, so a good rule is not to exceed a 
workout length of much more than 60 minutes. If you can work out 
longer than that, your intensity level probably needs to be increased.
 
4. When you’re happy with your exercise selection, the order, the total 
projected calories burned, the total workout time, and the body part 
mix, you’re ready to save your new custom workout by selecting 
Done.
 
 Your new workout populates the first available of the four save slots. 
After you choose a unique name and click OK, your workout will be 
saved and you’ll be asked if you’re ready to start your workout. It’s now 
time to get to work!
 
When all four save slots are filled, you must edit a workout — described in the 
next section — in order to make changes.
 
The four custom single player and the four custom two player workout slots 
are shared for all users of the EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer program. If 
you delete a custom workout using your profile, you delete that custom 
workout for everyone.
Editing your routine
After one or more of the four available workout slots are filled, you will have 
the capability to edit or delete these workouts. Clicking the red x allows you 
to delete, while clicking the blue pencil allows you to edit.
Follow these steps to edit a routine:
 
1. If you generally like a workout routine you’ve created, but there is an 
exercise you don’t want to perform on a certain day, simply click on 
the routine (not the pencil or x icons).
 
 The Today’s Exercises menu appears.
 
2. Click on the green check mark for the exercise(s) you don’t want to 
perform.
 
 A red x appears next to these activities. If your routine includes more 
than eight exercises, be sure to scroll through all exercises by clicking 
the arrow on the right of the green check marks. When satisfied, click 
Continue. This shows you the projected calories burned, and once you 
click Done, your workout begins.
 
3. If you want to add exercises, switch the order of the exercises, or 
permanently delete an activity from one of your custom routines, 
select the blue pencil icon for that routine.

189
 Chapter 9: Getting Active with the Routines
 
 This opens the Create My Workout screen. To make your edits, follow 
the instructions as outlined in the “Creating Your Routine” section 
earlier in this chapter.
Trying these routines
Now that you know how to create a routine, you can try the three sample 
routines in Tables 9-5 through 9-7 that help tone your upper, lower, and 
total body, respectively, and assume you don’t have access to a Wii Balance 
Board. These routines can help guide your thought process as you continue 
to build more of your own routines. Feel free to try these as-is or modify 
them for your specific needs or with your own ideas.
As we mention earlier, recovery is key. You want to train to failure, which is 
the point where you can no longer effectively perform exercises at maximum 
effort — but not beyond — as your body will have great difficulty repairing 
the muscle damage and rebuilding stronger for next time. If your body is 
constantly worn down, you can retard or even reverse your progress. For 
this reason, all the sample routines are well under 60 minutes. You want to 
train your body as hard as possible for as short of a time as possible and 
then spend the rest of the time eating right and resting for maximum gains. 
Particularly when first getting started, you are best served with one to two 
days of rest between every complete workout. If, for example, you work 
upper body on one day, you can take a break the next and then do lower 
body on the third. If you do a complete body workout, try taking two days off 
before your next strenuous activity. As you become more familiar with your 
body and how it responds, you can adjust these rest periods accordingly.
EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer does a good job of encouraging the use of 
exercise variety and targeting multiple body parts, but deviates slightly from 
the real-world standard of sets. A rep, or repetition, is merely the start to 
finish of an exercise motion. Multiple reps of an exercise motion comprise a 
set (for example, 8 to12 repetitions form a complete set). In lieu of multiple 
sets of a single exercise, EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer generally encourages 
doing a single set and moving on to the next exercise, perhaps returning to 
a particular exercise later on in the routine. The sample routines provide 
a more traditional approach of performing the same exercise for multiple 
sets. This traditional approach is easy to duplicate in the Create My Workout 
screen; simply add the same exercise to the list to match the desired number 
of sets. The advantage to multiple sets of the same exercise is simple — 
you’re guaranteed to target the same exact muscle groups each time and 
really work them to failure. You also have a slightly lesser risk of injury as 
those same muscles should already be thoroughly warmed up.

190
Part II: EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer 
Finally, in each of the sample routines, we begin with a warm-up, go through 
a logical body-part progression, do some cardio, and then end with a 
cooldown. By default, every exercise is set to Medium, but, depending upon 
your skill level, this can be adjusted up or down, which will also of course 
affect your total workout time and projected calories burn accordingly.
 
Stretching is not a warm-up. Stretching cold muscles can cause micro-tears. 
If you wish to stretch, do so carefully and only at the end of a workout after 
you’re thoroughly warmed up.

A regular, well-rounded workout regimen that targets all your core muscle 
groups is essential to obtaining results. Although it may be tempting to work 
certain body parts to the exclusion of others, this may leave your body 
looking off balance, especially after a desirable weight is reached. Further, it is 
impossible to spot reduce, meaning you can’t target where your body will lose 
body fat. The human body tends to react systemically to stress, and you will 
lose weight from all areas of your body, including areas where you might like 
to retain your current shape. For instance, when many women lose weight, 
they find their breasts shrinking, much to their dismay. To keep your body 
looking balanced and counteract these effects, it is beneficial to work your 
whole body over a period of time, say every seven days. So even if you think 
you don’t have to work your legs or chest, it’s important for your continued 
progress to regularly include them in your workouts. Of course, you can place 
greater emphasis on certain muscles if you wish to build more strength in 
them.
Assessing Your Post-Workout Results
After you complete your workout, EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer provides 
you with your post-workout results, including Summary, Performance, 
and Goals screens. The first screen is the Summary screen, which lists the 
calories burned, workout time, and number of exercises completed in the 
left-hand column and provides trainer feedback in the right-hand column, as 
shown in Figure 9-5.
The following steps guide you through navigating your results:
 
1. Click Next at the bottom right of the screen.
 
 A Performance screen appears, which provides a graphical depiction 
of how many calories you burned (shown by the blue line) versus what 
was projected before your workout based on your bodyweight.
 
 See Figure 9-6 for an example of the Performance screen.

2. Click Next at the bottom right of the screen again.
 
 The Goals screen appears and shows you how far you’ve progressed 
toward your goals, provided you have a fitness profile and did not work 
out using a guest pass. See Figure 9-7 for an example of the Goals screen.
 
3. Hover the cursor over each goal, including calories, hours, and 
workouts, to see what each of your current goal settings is and 
whether it has expired.
 
 Turn to Chapter 7 for more on these goals and how to set them.

195
 Chapter 9: Getting Active with the Routines
 
4. Go back to any of the previous Post-Workout Results screens by 
clicking the Back button.
 
 If you return to the Summary screen and click Back again, you will be 
brought back to the workout, which you can redo should you choose to 
do so.
 
5. If you are done assessing your Post-Workout Results and do not want 
to repeat the regimen, continue to click Done.
 
 You can also opt to see which trophies you’ve won by clicking Trophies 
at the bottom of the screen.

Although receiving trainer feedback and maintaining a record of your progress 
can be useful and fun, remember that no matter what the cold, hard data 
indicate, only you can truly judge your progress. If you feel like you got in a 
good workout, then you probably did. Little things such as getting an extra 
repetition or being able to do one more exercise than the last time, not to 
mention your clothing fitting better, are all very personal indicators that 
you’re well on your way to achieving your goals. Although computer software 
can give you trophies and medals along the way, it can’t give you the pride 
that comes from these physical accomplishments, which serve as the best 
measure of your progress.

W
hile the two games featured in the first two parts 
of this book work hard to establish their brands, 
the game featured in this part take the comparatively easy 
way out by aligning with commercial juggernaut and fit-
ness celebrity, Jillian Michaels. Of course, there’s no easy 
way out for you as Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
is just as serious about working out as the other two 
games. Luckily, it’s also as much fun. After being intro-
duced to Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 and learn-
ing how to navigate through its various elements, you 
learn about the exercises and how to perform them. 
Finally, you find out how to work with the preset routines, 
as well as how to design your own. Who knows? You may 
be the next fitness celebrity getting in people’s faces to 
motivate them!

ajesco’s Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2009, released in the United 
States on October 21, 2008, was advertised as the first game of its 
type to “combine a celebrity fitness trainer with the Wii and innovative Wii 
Balance Board accessory to offer you a fun and entertaining way to get fit.” 
Although the first part of that statement is factually correct and no doubt 
helped the game sell over 500,000 copies in its first five months alone, its 
actual execution left much to be desired. From lackluster visuals to a confus-
ing menu system to poor motion control tracking, Jillian Michaels Fitness 
Ultimatum 2009 disappointed many of The Biggest Loser star’s legion of fans. 
Luckily, Majesco quickly went back to the drawing board and enlisted a new 
developer for Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010, which was released on 
October 6, 2009, and addressed many of the first game’s shortcomings by 
greatly simplifying the experience. Although the 2009 version supports multi-
ple control schemes and multiplayer functionality, 2010 supports just a single 
Wii Remote and optional Balance Board, and drops multiplayer entirely, 
focusing instead on a quality one-on-one experience with the virtual fitness 
celebrity. Speaking of Jillian Michaels, her digital avatar has never looked 
better and the rest of the game’s visuals have received a similar boost. A new 
surprise feature makes the 2010 version accessible to more people — the 
game now can be played in Spanish!
This chapter provides you with all you need to know to get started using

Part III: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
Introducing Jillian Michaels 
Fitness Ultimatum 2010
With motion-captured movements, fitness routines, and audio from Jillian 
Michaels herself, Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 makes good use of its 
celebrity branding, including having her digital avatar present for one-on-one 
training throughout the game. You can work out in one of ten different Pacific 
island locations with 18 unique exercises, described in Chapter 11, that really 
put your strength and cardiovascular system to the test. A Resolutions mode 
features a customizable training calendar that lets you plan exercise routines 
for up to six months (see Chapter 12). Adjustable difficulty levels and a focus 
on safely warming up and cooling down help round out the Jillian Michaels 
Fitness Ultimatum 2010 experience. Now that you know what’s in store for you 
with the game, you can begin your journey not in the negative as the biggest 
loser, but in the positive as the biggest winner. You can do it!
Registering Your Information
After starting the game, you are presented with a brief video introduction 
from Jillian Michaels and then immediately taken to the Registration Menu. 
At the Registration Menu, you have the choice of one of three options: New 
Profile, Existing Profile, or Guest, the last of which offers access to all of 
the game’s features except for Resolutions, but does not save any data. 
Whenever you select any of the three options, you are asked if you have a Wii 
Balance Board. If you do have a Balance Board and have not already synced 
it with your Wii, please refer to Chapter 1 for setup information; otherwise, 
power it on and select Yes when prompted. You are guided through a brief 
calibration process, including a weigh-in. Note that the weigh-in does not ask 
you for the weight of your clothes, so keep that in mind when you see the 
number on the Profile screen.
 
Even if you answer No to having a Balance Board, you can still perform the 
Balance Board activities without tracking, by mirroring the movements of 
Jillian’s avatar.
When entering a New Profile, you are asked for the following information: 
Name, Age, Height, Weight, and Gender. Using your Wii Remote, enter the 
requested information by clicking on the appropriate label with the A button. 
Click DEL to erase any mistakes, press your Wii Remote’s B button to exit 
the data entry without saving, or click Enter when you’re happy and done 
with your input. Note that there is an eight-character limit for names in the 
program, so if you have a long first name like one of the authors of this book, 
you need to figure out an alternative. If you have a Balance Board, you do not 
need to manually enter your weight.

201
 Chapter 10: Getting Started
 
The only information you need to enter when creating a New Profile before 
proceeding is your name, but it’s better if you take the time to enter every-
thing else as well. Of course, you can always go to Edit My Profile under My 
Info at any time to change any of the information, except for your name, which 
is permanent unless you erase your entire profile.
There are only four available profile slots, so if you try to create a New Profile 
with all four slots already taken, you will be given the option of erasing an 
existing profile. This is also the only way you can remove a profile once it has 
been created, so it pays to create carefully in the first place!
 
Just like EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer, Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 
2010 does not keep track of your birthday, so be sure to update your age in 
the game every time your age changes to ensure accurate tracking.
Navigating the Island Hub
After creating a New Profile, choosing an Existing Profile, or signing in as 
a Guest, you are presented with the Island Hub, shown in Figure 10-1, and 
described in detail in the following sections.
 
Press B at any time on your Wii Remote to go back to the preceding screen.

The Workout Area
The Workout Area consists of Island Overview, Single Exercise, Circuit 
Training, and Resolutions, as shown in Figure 10-2. The following list 
describes each part.
 
Figure 10-2: 
The 
Workout 
Area.
 
 
✓ Island Overview: The game picks a random exercise at a predetermined 
difficulty level for you once you select one of the available locations: 
Cascade, Pier, Desert, Sand Dunes, Marshland, Rock, Jungle, Hilltop, 
Beach Landing, or Random. As opposed to Single Exercise, this area is 
best for when you really aren’t sure what you feel like doing or want a 
surprise.
 
✓ Single Exercise: This area allows you to specify all of the details you 
couldn’t in the Island Overview. You get to choose your exercise, the 
number of repetitions, the location you want to work out in, and the back-
ground music. For more information on this area, refer to Chapter 11.
 
✓ Circuit Training: Choose between one of Jillian’s Circuits that focuses on 
a particular area of your body, or one of your own, either already created 
or built on the spot. For more on Circuit Training, turn to Chapter 12.
 
✓ Resolutions: This area enables you to create a custom workout schedule 
for up to six months, or you can select a premade schedule provided by 
Jillian Michaels. For more on Resolutions, see Chapter 11.

203
 Chapter 10: Getting Started
Jillian’s Locker
Enter Jillian’s Locker if you are in the mood to change her avatar’s outfit, 
you want basic diet or exercise tips, or you are in need of some encourage-
ment. Tips include nuggets such as “go through your kitchen and throw out 
all the junk food and processed garbage immediately — you can’t eat it if it’s 
not there” and “exercise is the architect, and recovery is the builder. Your 
muscles need adequate recovery time to rebuild and get stronger.” While 
Jillian is tough on The Biggest Loser and doesn’t tolerate slip-ups, the tips 
here acknowledge that it can be tough to always make healthy choices, and 
they serve to encourage you even through times of weakness. As you use 
the program, more tips will become unlocked. Let’s briefly explore the three 
options in this area:
 
✓ Outfits: Outfits allows you to choose between three workout outfits, 
each with three different color combinations (though two of them look 
virtually identical), for Jillian to wear during the game. You can rotate 
Jillian’s avatar by pressing left and right on the D pad or by clicking on 
the blue arrows that appear on either side of her. You can also zoom 
in on her upper body by pressing up and down on the D pad. Onscreen 
icons indicate the D-pad movements for zooming in and rotating, but 
the labels for these are transposed, indicating you press up and down to 
rotate the avatar and left and right to zoom in, but this is incorrect.
 
✓ Diet Tips: Diet Tips enables you to view tips covering Diet Goals, Food, 
and Eating Out by clicking each of their respective tabs on the screen. 
After you select the tab you want, you can read through each of the tips 
in these categories by clicking the Previous and Next buttons on the 
bottom of the screen. More diet tips become unlocked as you use the 
program.
 
✓ Exercise Tips: Exercise Tips allows you to view tips covering exercise 
Goals, Time, and Mind, each of which has its own tab. Although none of 
this information is presented in a particularly compelling manner, the 
tips themselves are sound. You can read through the tips contained 
under each of these tabs by selecting the one you want, and then click-
ing the Previous and Next buttons on the bottom of the screen. As you 
continue to use the program, more tips become unlocked.
My Info
As the name implies, this area is all about you. Here you can modify and view 
your various in-game settings, including your profile, stats, options, and reso-
lutions. The following list examines each setting more closely.

204
Part III: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
 
✓ Edit My Profile: Allows you to see your Name and change your Age, 
Height, Weight, and Gender as necessary.
 
✓ My Stats: View your overall achievements and weight loss (or gain) to 
date.
 
✓ My Options: Consists of two options, Sound and Troubleshoot 
Mode. Sound allows you to change the volume for Voice, Music, and 
Environment so that you can get the most pleasing mix. Troubleshoot 
Mode lets you redo the calibration for your Wii Balance Board to verify 
that it is working correctly.
 
✓ My Resolution: View your Resolutions Calendar. For more on 
Resolutions, see Chapter 11.
Help
You can use two options here — Exercise Help and Scoring Help. Select 
Exercise Help to get a personal explanation from Jillian Michaels for every 
available Wii Remote and Balance Board exercise and Scoring Help to view an 
explanation of how scoring works.

Chapter 11
Tackling the Exercises
In This Chapter
▶ Examining exercise tracking and scoring
▶ Customizing the Single Exercise Workout Area
▶ Working out with Wii Remote exercises
▶ Performing Wii Balance Board exercises
▶ Cooling down exercises
A
good Wii fitness game provides quality exercises, and all of the games 
we cover in this book do this. What distinguishes Jillian Michaels 
Fitness Ultimatum 2010 from the rest is its use of explosive movements. 
Performing exercises explosively can increase your strength and heart rate 
as well as facilitate greater fat loss by helping to push your body beyond its 
usual abilities. Although ballistic motions can have great benefit, explosive 
exercises always need to be performed with great care because they can 
increase your risk of injury, particularly if you have sloppy form. Although 
it’s important to remain aware of and in control of your body at all times, 
it’s especially critical when performing explosive exercises such as those 
included in Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010.
In this chapter, we discuss how your exercise performance is scored, review 
how you can customize the Single Exercise workout area, and provide an 
overview of the individual exercises themselves and how to perform them. 
Exercises are organized based on whether they use the Wii Remote or Balance 
Board or whether they are intended for cooling down. Although you can power 
through explosive exercises, be sure to perform them at your own pace.
Examining Exercise Tracking and Scoring
Exercises use either the Wii Remote or the Balance Board, as outlined in 
Table 11-1, to track your movements by checking predetermined positions 
of the exercises against those of your Wii Remote or detecting weight shifts 
on your Balance Board. Your exercise performance — except when warming 
up and cooling down — is tracked onscreen by using the game’s Pulse Bar. 

206
Part III: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
The Pulse Bar is separated into four quadrants, each of which appears based 
on the motion of the exercise, then changes color to green, red, or yellow 
depending upon your timing while performing an exercise repetition.
 
If you do not have a Wii Balance Board, you can still perform the exercises, 
but your movements will not be tracked and you will be given a default 80 per-
cent of the possible points. Remember, Wii fitness is about maximizing your 
health, not maximizing your points, so be sure to work out intensely and with 
good form, even when you aren’t being tracked.
One exercise repetition can be worth a maximum of ten points if it is done 
correctly in time with Jillian’s onscreen avatar. If you can’t keep pace with 
Jillian, you can still get some of the points by getting your Pulse Bar to turn 
yellow. If you do the exercise completely incorrectly, the Pulse Bar flashes 
red and no points will be awarded.

If you want to change your point of view during any of the exercises, use the 
D-Pad on your Wii Remote. Pushing up zooms in, pushing down zooms out, 
and pressing left or right moves the camera in either direction, respectively.
 
You can press + on your Wii Remote at any time during an exercise in a circuit 
to bring up the Pause menu, where you have the choice of continuing or quit-
ting the exercise entirely.
Customizing the Single 
Exercise Workout Area
To customize individual exercises, select the Single Exercise option after 
selecting Workout Area from the Island Hub main menu. Figure 11-1 shows 
four tabs: Exercise, Location, Music, and Done. We describe each tab in the 
following list.

using your customizations. Here you see a summary of your selections, 
and after you are satisfied with them, click the Start button to begin the 
exercise.
Working Out with Wii Remote Exercises
Of the 18 available exercises, 9 use the Wii Remote. Although these include 
both upper and lower body strength movements and cardiovascular exer-
cises, each one requires you to hold the Wii Remote in one of your hands. 
The last thing we want is for your TV screen or other prized possession to go 
Kaboom! while you are working out, so be sure to use the Wii Remote’s wrist 
strap to prevent the Wii Remote from flying out of your hand while you are 
performing these explosive exercises.
Water Pump
As you likely guessed, Water Pump simulates the activity of manually pump-
ing water. This exercise works the tops of your upper thighs (quadriceps) 
and buttocks (glutes) through its squatting motion, while also targeting your 
shoulder and neck (trapezius) muscles through its upright rowing motion. 
Follow these steps to try this exercise:
 
1. Stand with your feet pointing forward and shoulder width apart. Raise 
your arms up as if you were grabbing a pump handle — in this case 
your Wii Remote — making sure that your elbows remain above your 
hands, as shown in Figure 11-2.
 
 Keep your torso upright and your eyes focused on a point in front of 
you, chin up.

209
 Chapter 11: Tackling the Exercises
 
2. Drop into a squat while pushing down the Wii Remote, as if you were 
pushing on a pump handle.
 
 As you squat, make sure that your knees do not travel over your toes.
 
3. Slowly come up out of the squat as you return your arms to their start-
ing position.
 
4. Repeat according to the onscreen instructions.
 
Figure 11-2: 
The start 
position of 
the Water 
Pump.
 
Sledge Swing
The Sledge Swing primarily works the tops of your upper thighs and buttocks 
through its squatting motion as well as the front of your shoulders (anterior 
deltoid) through its front raise motion. This exercise mimics swinging a 
sledge hammer. Now, get to building that power with these steps:
 
1. Hold your Wii Remote in both hands, fingers crossed, as if you were 
grasping the handle of a sledge hammer.
 
2. Stand, legs straight, with your feet just beyond shoulder width apart 
and toes pointing forward.

210
Part III: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
 
3. While still grasping your Wii Remote, bring your arms to your side 
and then up and over your head. Exhale sharply as you swing your 
Wii Remote down to the floor between your legs as you squat, being 
sure not to round your back, as shown in Figure 11-3.
 
Figure 11-3:

position of 
the Sledge 
Swing.
 
 
4. Bring the Wii Remote up and around to your other side as you inhale. 
Exhale sharply as you swing your Wii Remote down to the floor 
between your legs as you squat.
 
5. Repeat according to the onscreen instructions.
Hip Twist
Not to be confused with the Hip Twist in pilates that involves pivoting your 
lower body, the Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 version uses a differ-
ent angle, primarily working your stomach muscles, particularly those at the 
side of your waist. Start chiseling your midsection by following these steps:
 
1. Hold your Wii Remote in your right hand with both arms extended 
out to each side and parallel to the floor.
 
2. Stand with your feet farther than hip width apart, with your back 
straight and head looking forward.

211
 Chapter 11: Tackling the Exercises
 
3. As you exhale, swing your right hand down to your left foot as you 
bend your left knee. Touch your foot and then return to the starting 
position. Without stopping, inhale as you take your left hand down to 
your right foot as you bend your right knee and return to the standing 
position.
 
4. Repeat according to the onscreen instructions.
Oblique
The obliques are the muscles at the sides of your waist. The aptly named 
Oblique exercise primarily targets these muscles, while also working the rest 
of your stomach. If you desire six-pack abdominals, working the obliques is 
imperative to completing the look. To develop obliques magnifique, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Lay on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, 
spread about a foot apart.
 
2. Hold your Wii Remote behind your head with the buttons facing the 
back of your head and the top of the controller pointing away from you.
 
 Your elbows should be flat on the ground.
 
3. Use your stomach muscles to curl your body upward while you bring 
one elbow toward the opposite knee and exhale as you go.
 
 You can only go up about halfway because your opposite elbow should 
remain on the ground.
 
4. Slowly return back down to the starting position and inhale as you go.
 
5. Repeat the motion for the opposite side and continue according to the 
onscreen instructions.
Side Lunge
Lunges are great for gaining definition in your legs and banishing thigh jiggle. 
The side lunge primarily works the tops of your upper thighs and buttocks. 
Follow these steps to perform this exercise:
 
1. Hold your Wii Remote in either hand and stand with your feet 
together and arms at your sides.
 
2. Keep your feet pointed forward and take a step to the side (lunge) 
with one leg, bending at your hip until your thigh is parallel to the 
floor.

212
Part III: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
 
 Your step knee should be over your ankle while your opposite leg is 
kept straight with your foot flat on the ground. As you take the step to 
the side, bring your arms to eye level, parallel to the floor, and point the 
Wii Remote forward with each lunge.
 
3. Return to the starting position and repeat the same motion for your 
other side.
 
 Continue according to the onscreen instructions.
Back Kick
The Back Kick primarily works your buttocks, with a secondary focus on 
your shoulders and lower back. Get those buns of steel by following these 
steps:
 
1. Hold your Wii Remote in either hand, stand with your feet about 
shoulder width apart, elbows bent, and hands close to your chest.
 
2. Kick your right foot out behind you as you thrust both arms forward 
at eye level and bend at the waist so your body is parallel to the 
ground, as shown in Figure 11-4.
 
3. Bring your hands back toward your chest as you lower your leg back 
to the floor and straighten to a standing position.
 
4. Switch sides and repeat according to the onscreen instructions.

of the Back 
Kick.

 Chapter 11: Tackling the Exercises
Jumping Jack
Jumping Jacks do more than bring back memories of high school gym class. 
They also are great at targeting your cardiovascular system. While you likely 
do not need an overview of how to perform this activity, it is our job to 
instruct you, so here we go:
 
1. Hold your Wii Remote in either hand and point it at the ground.
 
2. Stand with your feet together, back straight, and your arms at your 
side.
 
3. Jump, bringing your arms over your head and landing with your feet 
about shoulder width apart and your Wii Remote pointed at the ceiling.
 
4. Jump again and return to the starting position.
 
5. Repeat according to the onscreen instructions.
Squat Jacks
As a fusion of the Jumping Jack and squats, Squat Jacks primarily target your 
cardiovascular system, the tops of your upper thighs, and your buttocks. 
These are great for combating cellulite, which is a common problem for 
women and also affects some men. Wage war on cellulite while gaining lower 
body strength by following these steps:
 
1. Stand straight with your arms at your sides, Wii Remote pointed at the 
ground in either hand, and feet shoulder width apart.
 
2. Jump, bringing your arms over your head, landing in a squat position 
with your knees bent at 45 degrees and your Wii Remote pointed at 
the ceiling.
 
3. Using your legs and buttocks, push yourself back to the starting 
position.
 
4. Repeat according to the onscreen instructions.
Running
Running targets your cardiovascular system and is a great way to build 
endurance. Although Wii Fit Plus and EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer offer 
running activities, this is your chance to go for a jog on a lush Pacific island 
without having to buy a plane ticket. Follow these steps to go for a run using 
Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010:

214
Part III: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
 
1. Hold the Wii Remote in either hand.
 
2. Jog in place while pumping your arms up and down, making sure with 
each step your knees rise up high and you land softly.
 
 Continue until time expires.
Performing Wii Balance Board Exercises
The following nine exercises use your Wii Balance Board and feature a range 
of strength-based movements. Many of these exercises require you to get on 
the floor.
 
Even if you don’t have a Wii Balance Board, you can still perform the Balance 
Board exercises without tracking, by mirroring Jillian’s avatar.
Boat Pose
The Boat Pose is a yoga pose that is referred to by yogis as Navasana. This 
pose, which primarily targets your stomach muscles, is similar to Wii Fit Plus’s 
Grounded V, which we cover in Chapter 3. Here is how you do the pose:
 
1. Lay flat on your back, arms at your side, with the back of your heels 
on your Balance Board.
 
2. Lift your hands about six inches above the floor with your palms 
facing in as you bring your legs and upper body together in a “V” 
position.
 
3. In a controlled manner, slowly lay back down to assume the starting 
position.
 
 For maximum effect, do not bend your arms or knees. Repeat per the 
onscreen instructions.
Crunch
Crunches are sometimes referred to as curl-ups, and they are one of the most 
common exercises to target the stomach muscles. While these are thought 
to be gentler on your back than traditional sit-ups, they can still be taxing on 
the spine. If you have back problems, you may opt to avoid these, as there 
are many other exercises that are great at working your abdominals. If you 
want to start crunching, follow these steps:
 
1. Sit on the floor with your Balance Board behind you.
 
2. Lay back so that your head rests in the center of your Balance Board.

215
 Chapter 11: Tackling the Exercises
 
3. Place your feet flat on the ground with your knees about a foot apart.
 
4. Interlock your hands behind your head, elbows wide apart and 
thumbs behind your ears.
 
5. Take a deep breath and exhale as you curl up and forward using just 
your stomach muscles until your shoulder blades are off the floor. 
Your hands are only there to support your head, not lift it. Hold at 
the top position for a brief moment, exhale, and lower yourself back 
down to the floor in a controlled manner.
 
6. Repeat for the indicated number of repetitions.
Swing Kick
An exercise inspired by martial arts, the Swing Kick primarily work your 
buttocks and the inside part of your upper thighs (adductors). Follow these 
steps to build powerful legs that you can use to protect yourself should you 
ever find yourself accosted in a dark alley:
 
1. Stand in front of your Balance Board with your feet about shoulder 
width apart.
 
2. Bring your hands up and hold them in a midpoint position for balance.
 
3. Swing your left leg up and over in a powerful motion so you end up 
touching the right side of your Balance Board, as shown in Figure 11-5.
 
Figure 11-5: 
Mid-point 
for the 
Swing Kick.
 

216
Part III: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
 
4. Swing your left leg back up and over to return to the starting position.
 
5. When prompted, switch sides, and repeat with your right leg touching 
the left side of your Balance Board.
 
6. Repeat for each side as indicated on the screen.
Lunge Kick
The Lunge Kick primarily works the tops of your upper thighs, your buttocks, 
and your stomach muscles. This exercise is another great one to add to your 
cellulite-busting repertoire. Follow these steps to perform the exercise:
 
1. Stand on your Balance Board with your feet spread evenly apart and 
your arms at your side.
 
2. Extend your right leg back, off of your Balance Board, until your left 
leg bends 90 degrees, as you inhale and swing both arms forward with 
your palms down until your arms are fully extended and parallel to 
the floor.
 
3. Bring your right leg forward and thrust your knee up at the ceiling as 
you exhale and move your arms down to your sides, back to the start 
position.
 
4. Repeat the same steps with your other leg and continue alternating 
according to the onscreen instructions.
Bicycle
Bicycles work your stomach muscles, with a particular focus on the rectus 
abdominis muscles. These are the muscles that give you that much sought 
after six-pack, provided you also watch your diet. To start working on those 
washboard abs, follow these steps:
 
1. Place the backs of your thighs across your Balance Board until your 
buttocks is resting against the edge.
 
2. Lay back, flat on the floor, and put your arms at your sides with your 
palms facing in.
 
3. Raise your right knee toward your chest as far as you can and then 
bring it back down so that the back of it touches your Balance Board. 
As you lower your right leg, raise your left knee to your chest.
 
4. Repeat in a continuous motion according to the onscreen instructions.

217
 Chapter 11: Tackling the Exercises
Side Plank
Just like Wii Fit Plus’s Plank, discussed in Chapter 3, Jillian Michaels Fitness 
Ultimatum 2010’s Side Plank works your core muscles, builds upper body 
strength, and requires quite a bit of balance. Follow these steps to perform 
the exercise:
 
1. Place your hands on your Balance Board with your body in a standard 
push-up position, described later in this chapter and shown in Figure 
11-6, as your starting point.
 
2. While balancing on your left arm, slowly roll your body back as your 
right arm extends to the ceiling.
 
3. Bring your right arm back down to the starting position and shift your 
weight to this side as you repeat the motion with your left arm.
 
4. Continue alternating sides according to the onscreen instructions.
Pelvic Thrust
The Pelvic Thrust primarily works your buttocks, with secondary emphasis 
on your stomach muscles. This exercise helps you gain definition in your 
rear. Here is how you perform the exercise:
 
1. Place your Balance Board on the floor and sit your buttocks on top of 
it in the center. Lightly grasp the sides of your Balance Board.
 
2. Bend your legs, keeping your feet flat on the ground as you lean back 
into the starting position.
 
3. Lift your buttocks as high as you can off the Balance Board.
 
4. Lower your buttocks back down to the starting position, touching the 
Balance Board.
 
5. Repeat according to the onscreen instructions.
Push-Up
The Push-Up in Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 works the same chest, 
shoulder, and arm muscles as Wii Fit Plus’s version, which is discussed in 
Chapter 3. It is also good at strengthening your stomach muscles if you keep 
your back straight and use your abs as a brace to keep your body locked in 
place. Follow these steps to perform the exercise:
 
1. Place your hands just outside the edges of your Balance Board so that 
you’re straddling it with your arms.

218
Part III: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
 
2. Extend your lower body behind you. Raise your arms to full extension 
and rise up on the balls of your feet, being sure to keep your upper 
and lower body straight and in line throughout the movement, as 
shown in Figure 11-6.
 
3. Lower your body down by bending your arms until your chest touches 
the Balance Board, and then push back up to the starting position.
 
4. Repeat according to the onscreen instructions.

Push-Up.
 
Closed Push-Up
Much like the Push-Up, the Closed Push-Up works you chest, shoulder, and 
arm muscles, with additional emphasis on your stomach muscles and overall 
core. This exercise also requires a great deal of balance. Follow these steps 
to perform the Closed Push-Up:
 
1. Place your hands on your Balance Board with your body in a standard 
Push-Up position, as described for Push-Ups and shown in Figure 11-6, 
as your starting point.
 
2. Bend your arms to touch your chest to your Balance Board.

 Chapter 11: Tackling the Exercises
 
3. At the top of the Push-Up, rotate your body to the right, lifting your 
right hand off the ground as your left knee swings up to meet your 
right hand.
 
4. Return to the starting position and repeat the same motions for your 
other side.
 
5. Repeat according to the onscreen instructions.
Cooling Down Exercises
Although the exercises described earlier are available at any time, the two 
cool-down exercises we describe in the following sections are only available 
during Circuit Training, which is described in Chapter 12. Because it is unnec-
essary to track a cool down, neither exercise makes use of the Wii Remote or 
the Balance Board.
Knees to Chest
Knees to Chest shares many similarities with the Bicycle, except instead of 
actively moving your legs, you’re focusing on holding various positions and 
stretching. Follow Jillian’s avatar for additional variations while performing 
this movement. Here is how to perform the basic Knees to Chest:
 
1. Lay down flat on your back.
 
2. Bring your knees to your chest.
 
3. Grab one knee with the same side arm and lower the other leg. Switch 
legs only when Jillian’s avatar does so.
Lunge Stretch
The Lunge Stretch is a less active form of the regular Lunge, where once you 
are in the bottom position, you concentrate on holding the pose and stretch-
ing. You can perform this stretch many ways; we describe one method. 
Similarly, you can also follow along with the variations that Jillian’s avatar 
employs. Remember, the point of a cool down is to wind down, so don’t 
overdo it!
 
1. Stand up straight, with your feet pointing forward and just under 
shoulder width apart.

220
Part III: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
 
2. Move your right leg back, placing your lower leg and knee on the 
floor as you extend your left leg out in front of you, touching your 
hands to the floor as you keep your head up.
 
 To intensify the stretch, lower your head.
 
3. Hold this position until Jillian’s avatar switches positions, and then 
reverse the sequence for the other side of your body.

▶ Examining Circuit Training
▶ Establishing Resolutions
S
ticking with an exercise routine is among the biggest challenges facing 
people looking to get healthier. Whether it’s boredom, lack of motiva-
tion, or lack of results, any number of factors go into a person losing momen-
tum and lacking the motivation to keep working out. A game, such as Jillian 
Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010, is the next best thing to having a live fitness 
celebrity get on your case and keep you moving through even the low points 
of your fitness journey.
One truism is, the more personal the experience, the more enjoyable it will 
be. In Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010, you have a great deal of control 
over your workouts, which consist of a series of exercises, in-game back-
ground locations, and music. Simply put, if you don’t like something, make a 
change.
In this chapter, you find out about custom and preset Circuit Training as well 
as custom and preset Resolutions. As you can see, you have many quick-start 
or personal options to choose from and configure. Get started by taking a 
look at Circuit Training.
Examining Circuit Training
Circuit Training is accessed from the Workout Area from the Island Hub main 
menu. Train by using either one of Jillian’s included circuits, or one you’ve set 
up and saved for yourself by selecting the exercises and the number of repeti-
tions — refer to Chapter 11 for an overview of the available exercises — if you 
want to include them in your circuit. Figure 12-1 shows the default Circuit 
Training menu screen, with the five predefined Jillian’s Circuits and five 
empty My Circuits slots that allow you to define and save your own workout 
routines.

222
Part III: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
 
Figure 12-1:

A circuit can have up to nine different exercise combinations from either one 
or both of the Wii Remote and Wii Balance Board categories as well as one 
warm-up and one cool-down exercise (see Chapter 1 for more on warming up 
and cooling down), both of which are required. Finally, a circuit consists of a 
location and music, both of which are definable on a per-exercise basis.
 
You can press + on your Wii Remote at any time during an exercise in a circuit 
to bring up the Pause menu, where you have the choice of continuing, skip-
ping the exercise, or quitting the circuit entirely.
Jillian’s Circuits
Jillian’s Circuits consist of five targeted workouts: Total Body 1 (Table 12-1), 
Total Body 2 (Table 12-2), Abs (Table 12-3), Upper Body (Table 12-4), and 
Lower Body (Table 12-5). The location for every exercise is random, except 
for Running, which always takes place on the Beach Landing. The music is 
random for every exercise. The tables below indicate which exercises encom-
pass Jillian’s Circuits. After selecting a circuit, such as Total Body 1, shown 
in Figure 12-2, you are given the opportunity to review but not modify what 
the workout consists of. Select Start Workout to begin. To exit, press the B 
button on your Wii Remote.

My Circuits
To create your own workout routine, select an empty slot by clicking Create 
New or, if all of the slots are filled, select an existing circuit to modify. When 
creating a new circuit, the My Circuit Training screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 12-2.
 
Figure 12-2:

Part III: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
On the Exercise tab, you have a choice of all available exercises (refer to 
Chapter 11 for an overview of the exercises). Scroll through the choices with 
either the left or right blue arrow. You can then add any exercise that is in 
the center of the list by hovering over it with your pointer and pressing A. 
You are asked to enter the number of repetitions you want to perform on the 
Reps screen. One such screen, for the Side Lunge, is shown in Figure 12-3. 
Your rep range is constrained by your choice of Easy, Medium, or Hard, and 
you can raise or lower your rep range within those limits by clicking on the 
up and down blue arrows, respectively, or by similarly pressing up and down 
on your Wii Remote’s D-pad. When you’re satisfied with your choice, select 
Done to move on.

Lunge 
exercise.
 
If you want to remove an exercise from one of the nine slots, click the slot in 
question. After it starts flashing, select Clear current slot to remove it.
 
If you don’t yet have a Balance Board, you may want to design a circuit of only 
Wii Remote exercises. Of course, not having a Balance Board shouldn’t stop 
you from doing those movements anyway for variety.
Unlike Jillian’s Circuits, you don’t have to fill all nine slots with exercises. In 
fact — particularly in the beginning — we recommend that you don’t fill all 
the slots and always pick the lowest possible number of repetitions until you 
get a feel for what works best with your body’s own exercise tolerance.

227
 Chapter 12: Running through the Routines
The same tips for creating your own routines that we give in Chapter 9 for EA 
Sports Active: Personal Trainer also apply when designing your own circuit in 
Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010. Try to design intense workouts that 
last less than 60 minutes and where you have a clear idea of what body parts 
you’re targeting (see Chapter 11 for what each of the Jillian Michaels exer-
cises target). Rather than detrimentally breaking your body down, getting 
sufficient rest between workouts and between working the same body parts 
is key to getting stronger and healthier.
 
You may just want to mimic Jillian’s Circuits based on the tables provided ear-
lier if for nothing else than being able to set your own locations and music.
After you’re satisfied with your exercise selections, click on the Warmup 
Cooldown tab. Your one warm-up choice is Running, though you’re able to 
select your lap range by clicking on the icon and going to the Laps screen. 
You have a choice of two cool-down exercises, Knees to Chest and the Lunge 
Stretch, each of which also has its own adjustable rep range. When satisfied, 
move on to the Location tab.
The Location tab allows you to choose the background Jillian’s avatar works 
out with you in. You can choose a different location for each slot you have an 
exercise in. When satisfied, move on to the Music tab.
The Music tab works just like the Location tab — one music selection per 
exercise in a slot. You can preview one of the 20 tracks by clicking the Music 
Preview bar, which also can be toggled off. Once finished, move on to the last 
tab, Done.
The Done tab is your last stop in the creation process. You have a chance to 
view the configuration of each slot with an exercise. Simply click the slot to 
see the summary of the Exercise, Reps, Location, and Music. If you want to 
make a change to any of the slots, go back to the appropriate tab and make 
your change; otherwise, click Save Changes. Input the name you want and 
then click Enter to save your circuit. This returns you to the Circuit Training 
screen, where you can then click on your newly created circuit and choose 
Start Workout to begin working out.
Establishing Resolutions
Resolutions is accessed from the Workout Area from the Island Hub main 
menu. Here you can set up and edit your Resolutions Calendar or view 
Jillian’s premade resolutions. To ensure consistency in your training, you 
cannot modify a Resolution after you have saved it. You can only delete the 
Resolution and start a new one.

228
Part III: Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 
When selecting Resolutions, you are presented with an option to continue 
with the Tutorial On or the Tutorial Off, with the only difference being addi-
tional descriptive text at each stage of the process when the tutorial is set 
to On. Selecting either option brings you to the My Resolution screen, which 
gives you the option of Create New or Jillian’s Pre-Made.
 
As with the rest of the games mentioned in this book, it is critical to Jillian 
Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2010 that your Wii’s date and time are accurate. 
Please refer to your Wii operations manual that came with your console or, 
for additional detail, Wii For Dummies by Kyle Orland (Wiley Publishing), if you 
need help setting the date and time.
Create New
Selecting Create New has you start by setting your weekly workout schedule. 
You are given a seven-day view to work with, which allows you to select up to 
four different single exercises or circuits for each day of the week. To create 
a new Resolution, follow these steps:
 
1. Scroll over the day of the week you want and press the A button.
 
2. Select the exercises you want to perform on the day by scrolling over 
a slot and pressing the A button.
 
 You have up to four slots you can fill with any combination of single 
exercises or circuits.
 
3. Select Circuit Training or Single Exercise.
 
 After you have made your selection, if you want to add additional exer-
cises or a circuit in one of the other available slots, do so now.
 
4. When you are satisfied with your day’s activities, click the Done 
button.
 
 You can now schedule activities for other days of the week. When you 
are done with your weekly schedule, click the Start Date button to select 
the start date on the calendar. After your start date is selected and you 
click the Accept button, select your end date.
 
5. Click the End Date button.
 
 A Resolution can be as short as two days or as long as six months.
 
6. Enter your end date and click the Accept button.
 
7. If you want to modify any of the information you entered, do so now; 
otherwise, select Save and Continue and name your Resolution.

229
 Chapter 12: Running through the Routines
You cannot modify a Resolution after it has been created; you can only delete 
it. After a Resolution workout is scheduled, you only have the 24-hour calen-
dar day to complete it or it is considered missed.
When you return to the Resolutions screen, you are brought directly to the 
calendar for your current Resolution, where you can see your latest informa-
tion or begin a workout. If you have a resolution waiting, as shown in Figure 
12-4, you are prompted to Attempt it or simply choose Later if you aren’t 
quite ready for your workout.

Jillian’s Pre-Made
Selecting Jillian’s Pre-Made resolutions presents you with four options: 
Arms, Back, and Chest, which takes place over a period of one month; Back 2 
Basics, which takes place over two months; Total Body Workout, which takes 
place over three months; and Ultimate 6, which takes place over the maxi-
mum six-month schedule. Naturally, Arms, Back, and Chest rates the easiest, 
while Ultimate 6 rates the hardest, so choose a Resolution based on your 
experience level.
These premade resolutions also provide great guidance for creating your 
own schedule, so don’t be afraid to tackle the game’s customization features 
after you go through one or two of these. Remember, although resolutions 
shouldn’t be made to be broken, they can easily be deleted if you don’t like 
how they’re designed — and you can try, try again!

Chapter 13
Ten Best Wii Fitness Accessories
T
hroughout this book, we show you how to maximize your Wii fitness 
experience. Now, you can accessorize it. One of the key tips to sticking 
with any exercise regime is keeping the experience fresh and fun to ensure 
that both your mind and body remain in the game.
Of course, some of these accessories are of the more practical variety, such 
as the rechargeable battery packs, while others, like the aerobics step risers, 
specifically enhance the difficulty level and effectiveness of games that use 
the Balance Board. Regardless of whether you implement one or all of these 
accessories now or in the future, we are sure you’ll agree that having so 
many options is nice.
Getting Down
Although the primary functionality of Wii Fit Plus is centered around the use 
of the Balance Board, which many other Wii fitness titles also support, you’re 
just as likely to be off the board as you are on it. For this reason, making your 
off-board experience — particularly floor work — as comfortable as possible 
is important. Exercise mats can help. Even a lightly padded mat can make 
working out on the floor a more pleasant experience, all while providing addi-
tional traction.
Many types of mats, including sticky, extra-thick, phthalate- and latex-free, 
eco-friendly, and printed are available. You have numerous choices when 
you’re looking for a mat that is best suited to your specific needs. However, 
the main characteristics you want to look for in a mat are padding and trac-
tion, because those two areas of functionality tend to be the most critical, 
particularly when performing yoga exercises. The following list covers the 
categories of mat options.
 
✓ Sticky: Most good mats have some type of non-slip gripping surface, 
either on one or both sides. Generally speaking, these mats provide 
a fair amount of traction on any surface, even rugs, which is impor-
tant when you’re trying to hold a specific position. Keep in mind that 
cheaper mats often have slicker surfaces.

234
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Extra-thick: The thicker the mat, the more cushioning is provided, 
something you’ll appreciate when your knees are digging into the 
ground. Typical mat thickness starts at 1⁄8 inch, while thicker mats start 
at 1⁄4 inch and can go to 1⁄2 inch or higher. Of course one downside to 
a thicker mat — particularly ones designed for pilates — is that you 
start to lose feel for the floor, a critical component of the types of yoga 
exercises you perform in Wii Fit Plus, for example. More expensive mats 
often contain air pockets rather than foam to provide better and longer-
lasting cushioning.
 
✓ Phthalate-and latex-free: Phthalates are substances added to plastics 
to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity. 
Because phthalates are being phased out in the United States over 
health concerns, it’s best to look for mats that are already free of such 
substances. Latex, on the other hand, is a natural or synthetic substance 
used to make rubber that is considered safe unless you have a specific 
allergy, in which case it also becomes a material to avoid when selecting 
a mat.
 
✓ Eco-friendly: Being in tune with your body often translates into being 
more in tune with the world around you, so a mat made from Earth-
friendly recycled material may be a good choice for you. Although these 
types of mats tend to cost more, they are typically fully biodegradable 
and latex-free.
 
✓ Printed: Most exercise mats feature textured surfaces in single, solid 
colors, but some, particularly premium mats, can feature elaborate 
designs or patterns. If you want something more decorative or provoca-
tive while you work out, keep an eye out for a design that personally 
appeals to you. Unfortunately, even if you find an appealing design, it 
may not have one of the other properties — such as being eco-friendly 
or extra-thick — that you’re looking for, so it’s best in this case to 
choose function over form, if you’re forced to choose.
Exercise mats are available from a wide variety of retailers, with some of the 
more specialized mats typically available only from yoga or pilates suppliers. 
Prices generally start around $10, with prices exceeding $100 for the fanciest 
mats. Somewhere under $40 tends to be the sweet spot for both price and 
performance.
Using Eco- and Econo-Friendly Power
The wireless nature of the Balance Board comes with a price — the even-
tual conspicuous consumption of batteries. As mentioned in Chapter 1, the 
Balance Board requires four AA batteries, which is the equivalent power of 
two Wii Remotes. The solution to this is to go with a rechargeable battery 
option, either rechargeable batteries or a special rechargeable battery pack.

235
 Chapter 13: Ten Best Wii Fitness Accessories
Although rechargeable batteries have a higher initial cost, they can be 
recharged many times during their service life — from approximately 100 
to more than 1,000 charge cycles depending upon type and brand. Use of 
rechargeables can greatly reduce the amount of toxic materials sent to 
landfills compared with the equivalent number of disposable batteries that 
would be required for the same usage period. Let’s take a look at some of the 
rechargeable battery options for the Balance Board:
 
✓ Standard NiMH rechargeable batteries cost approximately $10 to $20 
for four and require a charger ($15 and up), but are sometimes available 
in a combination package at a reduced cost ($15 and up). Keep an eye 
out for rechargeable batteries that promise more than 1,000 recharges 
for maximum value. Keeping extra rechargeable batteries on hand 
always gives you access to power even while your other batteries are 
charging and also makes a great addition to your Wii Remotes.
 
✓ The CTA Digital WI-BBP Battery Pack ($19.99) is a single unit that plugs 
into the Balance Board’s battery compartment. The CTA Digital battery 
pack is charged by using the included USB cable from any powered USB 
port, such as one on your Wii console. The unit can be charged while 
the Balance Board is being used.
 
✓ The Nyko Wii Fit Energy Pak ($29.99) is a single unit much like CTA’s 
offering, but instead of charging via USB, it charges via a regular AC 
power outlet for quicker recharges.
Of course, besides generally maxing out at approximately half the rated 
60-hour battery life of disposables between every charge, the major trade-off 
to using some type of rechargeable solution is that you need to remember to 
keep it charged!
Rechargeable battery solutions aren’t just for the Balance Board, either. A 
plethora of rechargeable options is available for your Wii Remote as well, 
from standard batteries that start around $10 for a pack of four without 
a charger or around $20 with one, to elaborate docking stations such as 
the Intec Nintendo Wii Charger Dock with four Battery Packs, which starts 
around $30. With the right combination of products, you can sever your Wii’s 
dependence on disposable batteries forever.
Keeping It Covered
Whether you use it with or without the Wii MotionPlus accessory, your Wii 
Remote should always be used with the Wii Remote Jacket for maximum 
safety. Although the Balance Board is designed to be used without a cover, 
adding a silicone, rubber, or plastic sleeve can add a touch of style, reduce 
wear and tear on both you and the board, and provide extra traction. Of 
course, removable covers are also much easier to clean and all exercisers 
can have their own board covers for optimal hygiene.

236
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Most covers are available in a variety of colors, as well as clear, and some 
even glow in the dark. The typically soft materials help to absorb impacts 
better than just the board alone, which is particularly nice on your feet 
during long step aerobics sessions. Covers are available from a variety of 
manufacturers, including CTA Digital, GamerGearOnline.com, Talismoon, WC, 
and YoungMicro. Major differences between brands include color, texture, 
and price.
Getting a Grip
As mentioned in Chapter 1, the Balance Board is best used with bare feet, 
even though using socks is more hygienic. Although the board does provide 
traction, the risk of slipping in regular socks is too great. If you are ashamed 
of your feet, they tend to get cold, or they become sweaty and slippery, con-
sider investing in a pair of non-slip socks, such as the ones from CTA Digital, 
DreamGear, or Hyperkin. Of course, there is a downside to even non-slip 
socks, as they can inhibit achieving optimal balance by preventing your toes 
from separating. However, there is a solution: toe socks, which are worn by 
the authors in this book’s photos.
Form fitting yoga or pilates toe socks not only provide a non-slip surface, but 
also allow a more complete range of motion. By allowing the toes to wiggle 
freely, the muscles in the foot can also become more flexible and stronger. 
Some toe socks even feature a horizontal stripe to help with alignment, which 
is particularly useful for certain Wii Fit Plus exercises. Toe socks are also 
available in half-toe varieties, where everything but your toes is covered. 
Brands include Acacia, Stick-E, ToeSox, and Yoga Paws.
With your feet receiving so much attention, are your hands feeling left out? If 
you find that even with the Wii Remote’s strap and jacket you’re still a sweaty 
butterfingers, consider non-slip gloves or grips, which, like non-slip socks, 
are also great for getting extra traction on floor exercises. Non-slip grips are 
available in full glove, fingerless, or palm-only varieties, and are available 
from manufacturers such as Stick-E, Sun Salutations, and Yoga Paws. Prices 
start around $15 per pair.
Creating Tension
EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer is centered around the use of its included 
Resistance Band. Although the EA Sports Active: Accessory Pack, discussed 
in Chapter 7, contains a second Resistance Band, it also contains a second 
Leg Strap, which makes it redundant and expensive for anything other than 
as a full replacement set or as a set for a second player. If you’re looking 
for just a Resistance Band replacement, either because yours is broken and 

237
 Chapter 13: Ten Best Wii Fitness Accessories
beyond the 90-day warranty period or you want something that offers more 
resistance, you need to look outside of the EA offerings. Luckily, resistance 
bands are a common exercise accessory, particularly for pilates enthusiasts, 
and a range of options is widely available.
You can find two basic types of resistance bands: the flat, ribbon style, such 
as the type that comes with EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer, and a shape 
more like thin rubber tubing. Other than personal preference, you won’t 
find major differences between the two types. Some, like Aylio’s Resistance 
Bands Exercise Training Set, include a range of bands that offer varying 
levels of resistance and a strap-style handle similar to the EA default option, 
which makes holding the Wii Remote easier. There are also other, lower-cost 
options, such as the Dyna-Band brand resistance bands that come in differ-
ent resistance levels and offer the same style of band that EA does, even fit-
ting into the same black straps.
Although you get the most use out of resistance bands in EA Sports Active: 
Personal Trainer because it was explicitly designed around their use, you can 
easily incorporate them into most other Wii fitness software when you want a 
different type of challenge.
Moving on Up
If you find that Wii Fit Plus’s step aerobics exercises, discussed in Chapter 5 — 
or any of the other programs’ exercises that involve stepping up onto the 
Balance Board — have become too easy, there is a solution for you. Adding a 
simple riser to your Balance Board allows you to raise the board to a height 
of four inches, which is standard in most step aerobics classes. Although 
not its intended purpose, in a pinch, these risers can also provide a higher 
and more stable platform on thicker rugs than the Wii Balance Board Foot 
Extensions.
Widely available aerobics step risers for the Balance Board include the CTA 
Digital 3-inch Aerobics Step Platform for Wii Fit, Everlast 3-inch Aerobic Step, 
and ZooZen Riiser Wii Fit Balance Board Aerobic Step.
Of Brassards and Remotes
If you use any of the myriad Wii fitness programs for any stretch of time, you 
may notice one major annoyance over all others — having nowhere to put 
your Wii Remote while performing the various exercises. Because, at mini-
mum, the Wii Remote is required for menu navigation, there’s really no way 
around its constant use. One clever solution to the issue of picking up and 
putting down your Wii Remote or holding it in your hand most of the time is 

238
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
an idea borrowed from those who work out with MP3 players such as Apple’s 
iPod — arm bands.
As of this writing, the most widely available arm band is the Wiitality 
Armband, which can fit over your biceps or wrist, the latter of which is the 
best location for programs such as EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer. This 
neoprene band holds your Wii Remote while you exercise, and leaves the but-
tons on the top of the remote fully accessible.
Breaking Free
Because both your Wii Remote and Balance Board are such wonders of wire-
less technology, it’s something of a disappointment when you get to an activ-
ity like Wii Fit Plus’s Rhythm Boxing, described in Chapter 5, and discover 
you need to attach the Nunchuk to your remote with a cable. Luckily, it’s 
easy to liberate your Nunchuk from its Wii Remote bondage. The following 
list describes a few of the available options to allow you to play more foot-
loose and fancy free. Try these options:
 
✓ Nyko Cord-Free for Wii Nunchuk converts your existing wired Nunchuk 
into a wireless peripheral by placing it into a self-standing sleeve that 
also acts as storage. This Nyko device runs on two AAA batteries, prom-
ising up to 60 hours of run-time.
 
✓ Nyko Wireless Kama is a stand-alone Nunchuk-compatible device that 
runs on two AAA batteries for up to 30 hours of run-time.
 
✓ Icon Wireless Playchuk Pro is a stand-alone, rechargeable Nunchuk-
compatible device with a built-in battery. Any powered USB port — such 
as the one on your Wii console — charges the device via the included 
cable. An LED charge indicator shows when the battery is charging.
 
✓ Intec Wireless Nunchuk is another stand-alone, rechargeable Nunchuk-
compatible device with a built-in battery, but features a more traditional 
design, similar to Nintendo’s Nunchuk.
Wireless Nunchuk solutions are available from most retailers that carry 
Nintendo Wii products.
 
All of the presently available wireless Nunchuk solutions, regardless of 
whether they adapt an existing wired controller or are stand-alone devices, 
require that a small receiver be plugged into the bottom of your Wii Remote. 
Keep in mind that these receivers may or may not be compatible with your 
current Wii Remote Jacket or anything else you might place your Wii Remote 
into, such as the weights described in the next section. The Leg Strap for 
EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer may also have issues with non-standard 
Nunchuk shapes, so it’s important to do research before deciding on which 
wireless solution is right for you.

 Chapter 13: Ten Best Wii Fitness Accessories
 
Wireless products that use a 2.4 GHz wireless frequency may be prone to 
interference from other devices, such as cordless phones or microwave 
ovens.
Heavy Handed
Earlier in this chapter, we mention that one way to up your workout inten-
sity with the Balance Board is to use an aerobics step riser. Although this is 
a great solution for working your lower body and overall cardiorespiratory 
system, an excellent alternative or adjunct to this is to put more focus on 
your upper body by turning your Wii Remote and Nunchuk into dumbbells. 
There are presently two solutions, each of which maintains full controller 
functionality while in use:
 
✓ Power Play Corporation RiiFlex dumbbell pair comes in both 2-lb. 
(green) and 4-lb. (blue) options, with one dumbbell holding Nintendo’s 
standard Wii Remote, without a Wii Remote Jacket, and the other dumb-
bell holding Nintendo’s standard Nunchuk.
 
✓ Everlast 2lb Dumbbells provide a lower cost alternative to the RiiFlex, 
but currently come in only one size and feature more traditional styling.
Even though programs such as Wii Fit Plus have you to use the Nunchuk for 
only a few activities, such as Rhythm Parade discussed in Chapter 6, and EA 
Sports Active: Personal Trainer often has you place the Nunchuk in the Leg 
Strap, to maximize the effectiveness of these weights, try to hold both dumb-
bells whenever possible. One nice feature about the added weight to your Wii 
Remote and Nunchuk is that you can make use of them even outside of the 
Wii fitness programs for just about any other Wii-related activities.
 
Safety and form are always your two top priorities. If you find you’re getting 
tired or the weights become too heavy to move correctly, immediately switch 
to using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk normally, or simply take a breather.
Of course, there are many other options for adding weight to your Wii fitness 
regimen, including wrist and ankle weights and weight vests. Naturally, if you 
use any of these heavy accessories, be sure to weigh yourself on the Balance 
Board before using them, and make sure that your combined weight does not 
exceed the board’s 330-lb. limit.
Stepping Out
Studies have shown that pedometers not only encourage users to walk more, 
but also to move more. For some, a pedometer might reinforce behavior 
change; for others, it may simply act as a wearable reminder to stick with 

240
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
the healthier lifestyle that began with Wii Fitness For Dummies. If you can 
instantly check how you’re progressing based on data from even a tiny 
device like a pedometer, the immediate satisfaction you receive can pay huge 
dividends, and Wii Fit Plus allows you to log your steps. Turn to Chapter 2 for 
more on this.
Although most pedometers count each step a person takes by detecting the 
hip motion, some pedometers can be tuned to detect aerobics steps or other 
types of motion, usually by adjusting the step-length setting. These pedom-
eters can be used even when engaging in a Wii fitness activity, allowing you 
to log every step that you take. What follows are descriptions of a few of the 
more interesting low-cost pedometers:
 
✓ Omron HJ-112 Pedometer: The HJ-112 allows for flexibility in wearing or 
carrying the device, a plus when doing activities other than walking. The 
pedometer counts steps — including aerobics steps — and calculates 
distance and calories burned. The device has a seven-day memory.
 
✓ Yamax Digiwalker CW-701 Pedometer: The CW-701, known for its rug-
gedness and step counting accuracy, displays distance, calories burned, 
and both actual and activity time. The pedometer has a seven-day daily 
memory and keeps two weeks’ worth of totals. The device has a two-line 
display.
 
✓ Omron HJ-720ITC Pedometer: The HJ-720ITC tracks the same type of 
data as the other two devices, but also has an upload feature that allows 
you to keep track of your data, set goals, and see your progress in a 
more visual manner via graphs and charts on your personal computer.
Prices for these pedometers start at around $25, and they are available from 
a variety of retailers.
 
You often hear about a daily target of 10,000 steps when using a pedometer. 
This was proposed as a standard because it’s the approximate number of 
steps an average adult human would take if he or she walked at a brisk pace 
for 30 minutes. As always, because there is no universal gauge for an individu-
al’s fitness requirements, adjust this target up or down depending upon your 
own needs for a given day, week, or circumstance.

Chapter 14
Ten Other Wii Fitness 
Workout Programs
A
lthough this book covers three of the most popular Wii fitness titles 
in Wii Fit Plus, EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer, and Jillian Michaels 
Fitness Ultimatum 2010, these are by no means your only options. Besides the 
original Wii Fit and Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2009, and the expansion 
pack for EA Sports Active: Personal Trainer, EA Sports Active: More Workouts, 
there are plenty of other ways to satisfy your Wii fitness needs.
Some of these programs function more like interactive workout DVDs, while 
others are considerably more advanced and come with their own accessories.
Active Life
Namco Bandai’s Active Life games, which consist of 2008’s Active Life: Outdoor 
Challenge and 2009’s Active Life: Extreme Challenge, each come with something 
called the Active Life mat. In conjunction with the Wii Remote, the large mat 
allows one or two players to control the onscreen action with their hands and 
feet. Unlike the rigid Balance Board, the flexible Active Life mat is more like the 
popular dance pad controllers that support running and jumping. Unlike dance 
pads, which are typically intended for one person, the Active Life mat supports 
up to two players at once. Although the Active Life games are targeted primar-
ily to children, the activities can be enjoyed by the entire family.
The Active Life games feature a training mode for different body parts, but 
they’re less about traditional workouts and more about having what we call 
active fun.
Daisy Fuentes Pilates
Pilates has many similarities to yoga in form and function, but it puts more 
emphasis on deep breathing and the flow, or transition, between each new 
movement or exercise. Although a popular exercise method, no Wii fitness 

242
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
title specifically addressed the discipline until Sega’s Daisy Fuentes Pilates in 
2009. Daisy Fuentes Pilates is one of several celebrity-endorsed fitness titles 
available for the Wii and makes use of the Wii Remote and, optionally, the 
Balance Board, though the latter is required to be scored on some of the ten 
different exercises. Designed exclusively for a single player, Daisy Fuentes 
Pilates offers varying difficulty levels, preset routines, and customizable 
workouts.
DanceDanceRevolution
Konami’s DanceDanceRevolution series began life in 1998 as a breakthrough 
arcade dancing game, but quickly made its way home. The only major differ-
ence between the arcade machines and the home conversions is that instead 
of a metal dance pad, home users typically use flexible dance pads that often 
come packaged with the games, though a wide variety are also available for 
purchase separately. 
The Wii’s DanceDanceRevolution titles consist of Hottest Party (2007), Hottest 
Party 2 (2008), Disney Grooves (2009), and Hottest Party 3 (2009). While pri-
marily fun dancing games where the goal is to step on the appropriate spot 
on the dance pad when prompted, dance games can really test your cardio-
vascular endurance when playing the higher levels and even feature workout 
modes.
Gold’s Gym Cardio Workout
Ubisoft’s Gold’s Gym Cardio Workout title from 2009 takes more than a little 
inspiration from the original Wii Fit by also offering a virtual personal training 
experience, but with a primary focus on cardiovascular exercises, particu-
larly as they relate to how a boxer might train. The control options are varied 
and include one Wii Remote and the Nunchuk, or two Wii Remotes, with addi-
tional support for the Balance Board.
Exercises feature a range of activities, including cardio boxing, running, sit-
ups, squats, and log cutting. The program tracks your progress and the diffi-
culty level evolves accordingly.
My Fitness Coach
Ubisoft’s My Fitness Coach, released in 2008, is perhaps the most hardcore of 
all Wii fitness programs, but also makes the least use of the platform’s fea-
tures. Instead of incorporating the Wii Remote and Nunchuk — let alone the 

243
 Chapter 14: Ten Other Wii Fitness Workout Programs
Balance Board — My Fitness Coach instead asks what exercise equipment you 
have available. These might include items such as a heart monitor, stability 
ball, or free weights, with My Fitness Coach then customizing your routine 
from a list of almost 500 unique exercises. The program also guides you in 
taking various body part measurements, which are used in determining your 
fitness levels and helps to further customize your workouts to target problem 
areas.
Because My Fitness Coach does not rely on specific Wii accessories, it is able 
to feature a Group Exercise mode that supports up to four players. Of course, 
whether four people can work out comfortably in front of your TV is entirely 
dependent on how much space you have available.
The Biggest Loser
The third Wii fitness title to feature Jillian Michaels, THQ’s The Biggest Loser, 
released in 2009, is of course based on the hit NBC television series. The 
Biggest Loser makes good use of the familiar license, allowing you to compete 
with contestants from past seasons in 4-, 8-, or 12-week programs, or with 
another player in weekly challenges. The game features more than 88 exer-
cises that focus on upper and lower body, core, cardio, and yoga, with 66 of 
them able to incorporate the Balance Board.
Besides the typical workout customization and calendar features often found 
in these types of programs, The Biggest Loser also helps you count calories and 
offers a selection of 50 healthy recipes from one of the brand’s cookbooks.
Walk It Out
Walk It Out is a 2009 release from Konami, so it’s no surprise that besides 
supporting the Wii Remote, Nunchuk, and Balance Board, it also supports 
dance pads. The easiest way to picture Walk It Out is as a lower intensity ver-
sion of the DanceDanceRevolution games, where timing is still important, but 
how quickly you react isn’t. Although it’s arguable how much exercise benefit 
there is to simply walking, Walk It Out is designed to ratchet up the intensity, 
which is a key to providing better results.
Walk It Out also jazzes up the experience by featuring more than 100 songs 
and an interesting game world, where the more you step, the more the envi-
ronment opens up, with a large list of locations to explore and goodies to 
uncover. If you’re looking for a Wii fitness program with less intensity, but 
one that still provides some nice cardiovascular benefits and multiplayer 
support, Walk It Out is worth checking out.

244
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Wii Sports
Although not specifically designed around fitness, Nintendo’s Wii pack-in 
game, Wii Sports (2006), and it successor, Wii Sports Resort (2009), which 
comes packaged with the Wii MotionPlus controller add-on, will definitely get 
you moving. Although it serves as a low-impact alternative to specific Wii fit-
ness programs, many of the same types of activities, like boxing and tennis, 
are available, just in a different context.
On days you may not wish to do a traditional workout or are unable to make 
it outdoors to do something, playing either of the Wii Sports games is a fine 
alternative to simply passively sitting in front of the TV.
Yoga
Much like Daisy Fuentes Pilates, Dreamcatcher Interactive’s Yoga, released in 
2009, focuses on one specific discipline and runs with it. Yoga, more so than 
Nintendo’s Wii Fit series, places serious focus on the Zen-like aspects of the 
practice, showcasing real-life guru Anja Rubik along with an animated avatar. 
Besides the expected variety of yoga exercises, Yoga also provides the philo-
sophical basis behind the practice, encouraging overall well-being.
As a slower, more relaxing approach to yoga, Yoga provides a logical next 
step for those intrigued by what was provided in the Wii Fit games. Whether 
a concession to the more personal, spiritual nature of the game, or more 
likely due to it requiring the Balance Board, Yoga is a strictly single-player 
experience.
Your Shape
Ubisoft’s Your Shape (2009) takes a fresh technological approach to fitness 
by including a camera that scans and projects your image onto your TV 
in real time next to your virtual workout buddy and guide, celebrity Jenny 
McCarthy. As such, this single-player game is performed entirely controller-
free since your movements are tracked solely with the camera, allowing Your 
Shape to actively correct your form.
Although the camera can be adversely affected by factors in your room, such 
as poor lighting or a busy background, when you combine its personalization 
options with close to 500 exercises, Your Shape still makes a strong case for 
inclusion in your Wii fitness arsenal.
