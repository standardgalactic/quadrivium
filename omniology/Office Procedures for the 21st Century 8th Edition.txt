Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
E
lectronics are smaller, faster and wireless is the name of the game.The twenty-
first century office is high tech; office procedures are changing rapidly and are
influenced greatly by these technological changes. Today’s office professional
must possess a broad array of both technical and interpersonal skills. To keep pace
with changes, this means the office professional must be committed to lifelong
learning. The future promises to be an exciting one!
The purpose of this chapter is to help you understand how you will contribute
to today’s changing and challenging office. You will study how your role supports
the company, its mission, and your manager by the functions you perform and the
workspace you use.
Throughout the remainder of this text, the words manager or supervisor will
be used to refer to persons at all levels of management, and office assistant,
administrative assistant, and office professional will be used to refer to support
personnel.
Your Company
To project the image that you are a professional who knows what is going on in
your company, you must first spend some time getting to know all about the
business. With the economic changes that have occurred in the past few years,
companies have been downsizing and restructuring to maintain company stabil-
ity, which has meant a reduction in the labor force. These changes have caused
management to evaluate each employee’s contribution and value to the com-
pany. You must look beyond the job you are required to do and keep abreast of
company happenings and project an image that shows you make a valuable con-
tribution to the company.
KNOW YOUR COMPANY
Knowing about your company allows you to leave the impression
with others that you are knowledgeable and can be a source of reli-
able information. Much of this information is available in annual re-
ports, files, and the company intranet system. Your experiences and
inquiries will also increase your knowledge. Remember, you repre-
sent your company’s image (see Figure 1).
You should know the answers to the following questions:
• Is my company a national or international company?
• Where are its various plants or offices located?
• Who are the top executives?
• What products does my company sell or manufacture or what
services does it provide?
• Who are my company’s competitors?
• How does my company rank in its industry?
• Is my company publicly or privately owned?
Learn as much as possible and stay informed about your com-
pany’s progress. Showing interest in learning about the business can
enhance your advancement within the company.

company’s image.

MISSION STATEMENT
A mission statement presents the goals, strategic intent, and business direction for
a company. Having a mission statement can be one of a company’s most impor-
tant plans. By affirming the company’s primary goals, this statement assures that
everyone in the company is working toward the same objectives. Common ele-
ments found in mission statements are concern for public image; quality; commit-
ment to survival, growth, and profitability; identity of customers, markets, and
services; a statement of company philosophy; and the traits that set the company
apart from its competition. Each company’s mission is different.
If your company has a Web site, the mission statement usually appears on it.
For example, Ben & Jerry’s (Figure 2) shares its mission statement online (www
.benjerry.com). Notice that the mission statement (Figure 3) is divided into three

Central To The Mission Of Ben & Jerry’s is the belief that all three parts must thrive equally in a manner

Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
parts—product, economic, and social—and that these “three parts must thrive
equally in a manner that commands deep respect for individuals in and outside the
company and supports the communities of which they are a part.”
ETHICS IN BUSINESS
In addition to mission statements, companies also develop codes of ethics. Ethics is
defined as a person’s motivation based on his or her ideas of right and wrong.A code
of ethics (also called a code of business conduct) is a set of rules governing the be-
havior of all members of an organization.The code of ethics calls for high standards
of honesty, objectivity, diligence, and loyalty. Companies are concerned about issues
of ethical and socially responsible behavior of all their employees.These issues range
from the management person who pads his or her expense report to the office as-
sistant who takes office supplies home for his or her children to use as school sup-
plies. The overall view is that everything costs someone something. Behaviors that
violate the company’s code of ethics usually end up costing the customer.
Deciding ethical issues is not easy. To help you decide what is ethical, you need
to define the key issues. Here are some questions you might ask yourself to make
a decision easier:
• Is the action legal? Avoid any action that is against the law no matter who is
asking you to do it or how much you feel it would help someone.
• How would you feel if you were in their shoes? Place yourself in their position.
• What other solution might you choose? Look carefully at all your options.
Don’t be quick to choose the easiest option.
• Would it help to talk to someone else about the issue? Often talking with some-
one else about the problem helps you identify new alternatives.
• How would you feel if your family, friends, employer, or coworkers learned of
your action? If it couldn’t be put on the bulletin board at work, then don’t do it.
Companies are also concerned with public
confidence. The code of ethics is a way to assure
the public the company is concerned and is
addressing ethics with its suppliers, customers,
and employees.This same code gives the employee
direction concerning expectations of the com-
pany regarding his or her behavior on the job.
For example, Texas Instruments, Inc., a world
leader in the semiconductor industry based in
Dallas,Texas (Figure 4), has developed a code of
business conduct. A portion of that code is pre-
sented in Figure 5.
CURRENT OFFICE TRENDS
The office of today is not the same as yesterday.
With management faced with such things as
heightened global competition, economic down-
turn, and market transparency, the focus is on
change. Management must plan ahead for such
changes as labor mobility, instantaneous com-
munication globally, global effects on financial

decisions, and environmental impact brought by pressure groups. All these changes
affect today’s office environment. Here are some descriptions of current office
trends to which office professionals must adapt:
• The office professional is no longer a subordinate who takes orders and follows
direction from the manager. Administrative assistants are full team members
whose skills are absolutely essential to the operation of the business. The role of
an administrative assistant is highly specialized, and both advanced technical
training and human relations skills are paramount. The administrative assistant
Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
FIGURE 5 • Partial code of ethics from Texas Instruments, Inc.
(Source: Code of Business Conduct,Texas Instruments Incorporated, www.ti.com. Reprinted with permission.)
The Code of Business Conduct contains principles that have long been part
of TI’s values and ethics statements. Certain behaviors have been specifically
included in this Code of Business Conduct in recognition of the growing inter-
est that investors have in the conduct of publicly-held companies, their
employees, and their directors. The public has every right to know what TI
standards are in these areas. Furthermore, the public legitimately expects
TIers to know and adhere to the standards of conduct. This Code of Business
Conduct is intended to comply with New York Stock Exchange listing stan-
dards. Employees should refer to the section entitled Compliance
Procedures, Policies and Rules for guidance on complying with this Code of
Business Conduct. No provision of this Code of Business Conduct may be
waived for any director or executive officer without approval of the TI Board of
Directors and appropriate public disclosure.
• We do not take any role in any outside concern that would adversely influ-
ence our TI responsibilities. When faced with a potential conflict, we com-
municate with supervisors and others to implement safeguards and take
steps to prevent such a conflict from materializing. We make full disclosure
and withdraw ourselves from discussions and decisions when our personal
interest appears to interfere with TI’s business interests.
• When exchanging business courtesies, meals and entertainment, we avoid
activities that could create even the appearance that our decisions could be
compromised.
• We respect the rights and property of others, including their intellectual
property, and only accept their confidential or trade secret information after
we clearly understand our obligations as defined in a non-disclosure agree-
ment or similar document. We protect and preserve TI assets, including TI
business opportunities and intellectual property, for TI’s benefit and not for
our personal benefit.
• We compete fairly without collusion or collaboration with competitors to
divide markets, fix prices, restrict production or allocate customers.
• We assure that those who seek to do business with TI have fair opportuni-
ties to compete for our business.
• We provide full and accurate information for use in internal and external
reports.
• We keep records that are verifiably accurate.
• More items are listed. . . .

is a contributing team member who must make valuable decisions within the
realm of his or her authority.
• The level of skill and responsibility has changed. Administrative assistants use
sophisticated hardware and software and coordinate a myriad of details. The
gap between management and administrative assistant is closing.
• Working hours have become very flexible. The concept of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Monday to Friday is disappearing.With computer networking, many office pro-
fessionals perform some of their responsibilities from their home computer. The
mode of working from home and having flexible hours means that employees
have become managers of their own time. Self-discipline for these office profes-
sionals is an essential skill.
• Companies have become more employee friendly by providing wellness programs
and quality management programs that require input and recommendations from
the staff. So office professionals cannot simply bring problems to the attention
of management. Instead, they are required to make recommendations and offer
solutions.
• Office professionals have the opportunity and need to become entrepreneurial.
Where once one settled into long-term employment with benefits and eventual
retirement, we now see more short-term employment available and fewer jobs
with company benefits. Therefore, the office professional must be constantly
ready for change, in search of new assignments, and ready to upgrade technical
expertise. Fortunately, the skills of an office professional lend themselves to en-
trepreneurial work, giving assistants the ability to open their own businesses of-
fering office support to individuals or corporations.
• Technology will continue to remove routine tasks from the office. Instead, of-
fice professionals will take a higher level of responsibility.
• Cultural awareness and sensitivity is an expectation of employment and no
longer considered an exceptional skill found exclusively in people with good
public relations. Electronic communication has made the business world a much
smaller place so that office professionals are routinely in electronic contact with
clients or colleagues located in other countries. International travel is an expec-
tation of many executive positions. Face-to-face meetings and hosting interna-
tional guests is simply routine.
• Your office may be going green. It starts with wanting to protect the environ-
ment, but often it comes down to cold cash. Companies from global empires to
small mom-and-pop companies are embracing environmentally friendlier built
buildings, supplies, and services. A recent survey showed that employees, espe-
cially those who grew up recycling, would rather work for a green company. It
seems then going green may come down to who gets the employee.
The future is bright and opportunities are infinite. Office professionals should
always be looking for new opportunities, responsibilities, and possibilities.

Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
When beginning your employment, it is important that you understand the classifi-
cations of authority used by management within your organization’s structure.
There is a wide variety of ways to structure jobs within an organization. Organiza-
tional structure emphasizes people-to-people relationships. Automated/electronic
office concepts in organizational structure are centered on the flow of information
and the communication needs for decision making, and they involve a systems
approach to organizational structure. Regardless of the approach used, chain of
command (the direction authority flows; also called line authority), authority, and
responsibility must be established.
Classifications of Authority
The distinction among managers in terms of authority and responsibility is ex-
pressed as levels of management. Most organizations have three common divisions:
top level, middle (intermediate) level, and supervisory (operating) level. The higher
the level of management, the more responsibility and decision-making power the
manager has. The lower the level of management, the more responsibility the man-
ager has for day-to-day functions. Top-level management usually consists of the
president or chief executive officer (CEO) and vice president(s). Middle-level man-
agement typically is comprised of the division heads, sometimes called regional
heads, or area heads or chiefs. Supervisory-level management generally consists of
the department heads or functional managers (Figure 6).
The two most common types of organizational structure are line organization
and line-and-staff organization.
Line Organization
The oldest and simplest organizational structure used by management is line orga-
nization. In line organization, authority flows vertically down within the organiza-
tion delegated from top management to middle management. Line authority allows
supervisors to supervise employees immediately below them in the organizational
structure. The middle managers are in charge of specific activities, and they in turn
delegate authority to lower-level managers or supervisors who are in charge of em-
ployees carrying out their operational duties. Supervisory-level managers are usually
charged with the responsibility to give orders, hire, terminate, and take disciplinary
action. They make the majority of these decisions and direct line personnel to
achieve company goals. See Figure 6 for an example of line organization.

Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
The advantages and disadvantages of the line organization are as follows:
Advantages
• The structure of the organization is easily understood.
• Employees have direct accountability to their superiors.
• Each worker has a clear-cut place.
Disadvantages
• Each supervisor has large areas of responsibility.
• The organization is more structured, thus less flexible.
• The flow of communication and information is often restricted.
• The ability to transfer employees to where they are most needed is limited.
Line-and-Staff Organization
Another common management organizational structure is called a line-and-staff
organization. As its name implies, the line-and-staff organization contains both
line positions and staff positions. Line positions are those directly involved in the
day-to-day operations such as vice presidents, production supervisors, or depart-
ment heads. Employees who hold staff positions do not actually produce the
product or service but do contribute to the company’s overall mission. When a
CEO, vice president, or manager is responsible for several areas, he or she must
rely on others’ expertise. In these cases, knowledge specialists are available to pro-
vide advice. An example of a staff position might be a legal advisor, who would
provide legal advice as needed to the CEO, vice president(s), or supervisor(s). Staff
positions serve the organization by indirectly supporting line functions and by
providing advice and knowledge to other individuals in the chain of command,
but they do not make decisions. See Figure 7 for an example of line-and-staff or-
ganization.

Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
The advantages and disadvantages of line-and-staff organization are as follows:
Advantages
• Line personnel have freedom from performing specialized tasks.
• Staff has flexibility to pursue unique projects.
• Expertise is available to line personnel.
Disadvantages
• Line employees do not have a clear understanding of the staff manager’s duties.
• Problems arise if staff managers with line duties contradict the line manager.
Participatory Management
Organizations today, in an effort to increase productivity and to meet competi-
tion, are focusing more on using participatory management. Participatory man-
agement, put simply, is forming project teams to bring together employees with
the talents needed to work on a specified project.This management style is in con-
trast to the traditional line-and-staff management style. Employees are invited to
work in smaller units within large organizations and are encouraged to commu-
nicate with different levels of management. Employees are asked for input about
their areas of responsibility and frequently are brought together in conferences to
discuss problems and offer solutions. Under participatory management, each em-
ployee reports to someone in the formal structure, but while on a team working
on a specific project or problem, each team member has equal authority even if
the team is made up of a project director, an office assistant, an accountant, and
a custodial employee.
You should be aware that opportunities to participate in project teams and
other forms of participative decision making may exist where you are
employed, and you should accept your responsibility in making valuable
contributions.
How does the office professional’s role fit into the overall organizational struc-
ture? Your role will be to support the person in whatever line or staff position your
supervisor holds. By doing this successfully, you will be contributing to the com-
pany’s overall mission. You must understand, however, that organizational struc-
tures and job titles vary from company to company.You must begin by recognizing
the chain of command and the management style used in your organization. To do
this, you need to understand how authority has been established. Studying the
company’s organization chart (discussed in the next section) will reveal what you
need to know.

Organization Chart
An organization chart is a graphic illustration of the formal structure of an orga-
nization. To understand an organization chart, look for lines of authority, the ex-
isting division of work (into what may be called divisions, departments, teams,
units, or some other appropriate title), and the relationship of the work groups to
each other. If an organization manual exists, a description of the division of work
and the positions shown on the organization chart will be given in the manual or
will be located on the company’s intranet. The titles shown in an organization
chart may be expressed as either functions or positions, but the form chosen
should be used consistently throughout. Figure 8 shows an example of an organi-
zation chart for a single company division. Functions that occupy the same level
of management should be shown on the same horizontal line, as illustrated by the
Vice President Sales and the Vice President Production in the organization chart in
Figure 7. The bold lines indicate line authority. The thin (sometimes broken lines)
lines indicate staff authority.
As an office assistant, you might be asked to create an organization chart.
Organization charts may be created using the chart feature of Microsoft® Word or
by using a software program such as OrgPlus™ from HumanConcepts dedicated to
automatically generating charts.

You and Your Manager
Building a good relationship with your manager is necessary if you want to be rec-
ommended for promotion, to obtain raises, and/or to be given key assignments. To
accomplish any or all of these,you must receive good performance evaluations.How
well you do your job depends on this.Your principal job is to see that your manager
succeeds at his or her job (see Figure 9). By doing so you are contributing to the com-
pany’s mission through the work you do. Other benefits are gained as well because
this positive relationship creates a positive work environment for you.

and office professional is important.
Adapt to Your Manager and Your Job
✓Each time you are assigned to a new manager, learn his or her
priorities, preferences, and work habits.
✓Adjust your schedule to that of your manager.After you are well
acquainted with your manager, perhaps you can make helpful
suggestions, provided you have thought an idea through care-
fully. But do not attempt to change your manager. Keep in mind
the only person you can change is yourself.
✓Admire and respect your manager,and do what you can to build
his or her morale.
✓Refrain from expressing your manager’s opinions. Everything
that goes on in your office should be kept confidential.
✓Refrain from giving your personal interpretation of a company
policy. That is your manager’s job.
✓Be careful not to give away secrets inadvertently to your
friends and coworkers, your manager’s counterparts, or
competitors.
✓Be loyal. Loyalty (being devoted or true to one thing or person)
is rated as one of the most desirable traits that an office pro-
fessional can possess. It means that you support a person and
his or her ideas and actions.

Previous Job Titles
Current Job Titles
Office assistant, clerical assistant,
clerk typist
Administrative assistant
Secretary or senior secretary
Executive secretary or secretary
Executive secretary or administrative
manager
Office manager or supervisor
Usually a job title that includes the word administrative denotes a higher
level of responsibility than the word assistant does. Assistant is a generic term
that is being used more and more to denote an employee who performs all
types of basic office functions. Executive assistant denotes an office profes-
sional who works for one or more managers. A receptionist is a person who
supports management at all levels and usually greets the public and answers
the phone.
No matter which title the office professional has, today’s office is a dynamic
place to work. The Information Age has made the administrative assistant’s pro-
fession one that is exciting and challenging, and that requires fine-tuned technical,
administrative, and human relations skills. Administrative assistants are the
lifeblood of an organization. They are information and people managers, and no
company could be successful without them.
Your Role
You should understand your role in the company because you will be expected to
contribute to the company’s overall mission. You will be successful on the job by
acquiring the necessary skills and putting them to use efficiently. Make sure you
are current on such areas as the common job titles in your field. Be prepared to
answer questions such as What are the office support functions I will be required
to do? What is the possibility of working from home? What is the long-range
prospect for office positions in my field in the future? What will tomorrow’s of-
fice be like?
JOB TITLES
As office support roles become more diversified, job titles are also changing.
Although some of today’s office professionals are still called office assistant,
clerical assistant, secretary, senior secretary, executive secretary, or administrative
secretary, titles are changing.
The most common job titles remain administrative assistant, executive
assistant, executive secretary, office manager or supervisor, and secretary.
A wide range of titles, commonly including terms such as coordinator,
administrator, specialist, associate, or a title denoting specialized business types
or functions such as legal, accounting, medical, and human resources continue to
be prevalent. In the future technology experts, futurists, and trend watchers say
new titles will appear in the areas of resources, workflow, knowledge, telecom-
muting, and virtual meetings. Manager will be a common title while new titles
such as liaison, organizer, or controller will appear. See the table below showing
current job titles.

Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
Start Off on the Right Foot
Face it—it costs a company a lot of money to find the right office
professionals, train them, and keep them motivated enough to re-
main working with the same company. So it’s crucial that the com-
pany start off on a positive note with new employees. Here’s what
many companies do on Day 1 to ensure a good start with their new
office professionals:
✓Let new office professionals see the big picture by discussing
the company’s mission and purpose.
✓Take a skills inventory of all new employees so the company
can place them in positions where they will be productive.
✓Connect new employees to a work team that depends on their
professional skills.
✓Acquaint new office professionals with their new surroundings
and new coworkers.
✓Assign each office professional a volunteer mentor whom he or
she can rely on to answer questions, give support, and supply
encouragement.
✓Make new office professionals feel welcome as valued mem-
bers of the staff.
It may sound simple enough, but it takes good management to
make it a reality.
OFFICE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS
Typical office support functions range from routine to managerial functions.These
functions fall into five categories: routine, technical, analytical, interpersonal, and
managerial.
• Routine functions. Require minimal original thinking; include essential
skills, such as filing (document storage and retrieving with emphasis on elec-
tronic record keeping), photocopying, coordinating direct mailings, and
keeping logs.
• Technical functions. Require judgment and advanced office skills, such as a
high level of document preparation and proficiency using various software
applications, including spreadsheets, databases, project management, and
presentations (creating and presenting); maintaining multiple schedules and
calendars; handling messages and correspondence (with voice mail, e-mail,
and regular postal mail); and maintaining computer files, directories, and
databases.
• Analytical functions. Require critical and creative thinking and decision-
making skills, such as creating and analyzing reports, planning meetings and
special events, working closely with vendors and suppliers, and making deci-
sions regarding equipment purchases.
• Interpersonal functions. Require judgment, analytical (decision-making) skills,
and people skills, such as coordinating a team project or quickly establishing
rapport with team members and identifying and responding to preferred work
styles and personality traits.
• Managerial functions. Require planning (analytical), organizing (analytical),
measuring (analytical), and using Internet/intranet and communications for re-

TELECOMMUTING
More and more companies are offering office person-
nel the opportunity to work from home or other re-
mote locations connected to the office via computer
called telecommuting (see Figure 10). The same work
completed in the office can be done at these remote lo-
cations using phones (or cellular phones), fax ma-
chines, computer hookup (by modem, broadband
access, or wireless technology), printers, scanners,
voice mail, e-mail, instant messenger, text messaging,
laptop, and handheld computers.
One question commonly asked by telecommuters is
“How will my manager or supervisor know I am work-
ing if he or she cannot see me working at my desk?”The
obvious answer is the telecommuter’s workload is mea-
sured by the amount of work submitted on time or
ahead of time. Here are a few of the questions that
should be answered before agreeing to telecommute:
• Am I expected to work specified hours? This time
should be defined.
• Who will provide the equipment needed for my
home office?
• Who will pay for the supplies used? The phone?
• How often will I be required to contact the office?
• How will work be submitted? How often? When?
FIGURE 10 • More and more employees are choosing
to work from home.

Virtual Office
The Internet and a growing list of breakthrough telecommunication services have
made today’s world smaller and more accessible. An increasing number of man-
agers are abandoning the problems and politics of corporate life in favor of work-
ing independently. By doing so, the need for full professional assistance with a
variety of support responsibilities is provided by virtual assistants (VAs) with just
the click of the mouse. Virtual assistants are independent entrepreneurs. They
work from their fully equipped home offices to assist other entrepreneurs or com-
panies with the following tasks:
• desktop publishing
• Internet research
• event planning and reminder services
• word processing
• travel arrangements
• technical writing
• bookkeeping
• marketing support
Communications are generally by, but not limited to, e-mail, mail, fax, tele-
phone, and file and diskette transfer. The entrepreneur or company avoids insur-
ance, payroll tax, and Occupational and Safety Health Administration (OSHA)
issues that employees bring and pays only for “time on task,” or by project. Be-
cause VAs save companies or independent entrepreneur’s money, are available be-
yond a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. schedule, work only when needed, and require no office
space and no equipment, their popularity is growing.
Virtual assistant opportunities are growing so fast that VAs have founded their
own International Virtual Assis tants Association (IVAA). You may obtain more
information about this organization from the Web site www.ivaa.org.
JOB PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE
The prospects for the employment of office personnel look very positive. More
than 362,000 administrative assistant and secretarial positions will be added in the
United States between 2006 and 2016, representing growth of 4.5 percent
according to the U.S. Department of Labor, as reported by the Occupational
Outlook Handbook, 2008–09 Edition.

Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
Here is what the futurists tell us:
• Mobile offices allowing employees to work from anywhere will become more
common.
• Internet research, desktop publishing, computer training, and Web site mainte-
nance will play a larger role in the office professional’s job function.
• Web-based conferencing services will continue to provide employees with real-
time access to meetings, thus reducing the need to travel.
• Telecommuting will increase.
As companies continue to outsource work outside the United States, job markets
will shrink. The need for education will determine how well workers will advance.
The U.S. Census Bureau reports that a worker over eighteen years of age and hold-
ing a bachelor’s degree will earn nearly twice as much as a worker over eighteen
with a high school diploma.
Your Workspace
With most Americans spending 70 percent of their waking hours at work, the of-
fice environment should be as safe, healthy, comfortable, and productive as possi-
ble.Then why don’t we feel more at home in the workplace? The answer is we have
traditionally been expected to conform to the workplace. However, workers have
not conformed as management expected. One reason has been that as computer
technology advanced and more office workers began using computers, problems
of user comfort arose. Because of the physical and medical problems that have
developed, an entire market of products has evolved that supports computer
workstations. Office furniture and computer accessories designed for comfort,
including halogen task lights, mouse pads, ergonomic keyboards, monitor arms,
ergonomic chairs, wrist rests, and adjustable seating and reception desks, are all
available.
ERGONOMICS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL OFFICE
With such emphasis being given to the development of computer products and the
work environment, the field of ergonomics evolved. Ergonomics is the science of
fitting the workplace to meet the physical and psychological needs of the em-
ployee. Everything that affects the worker must be taken into consideration—
computer workstation, décor, furniture, lighting, workspace, air quality, heating
and cooling, acoustics, and equipment placement. A well-designed office allows
each employee to work comfortably without needing to overreach, sit or stand
too long, or use awkward postures. Sometimes, equipment or furniture changes
are the best solution to allow employees to work comfortably. On other occa-
sions, the equipment may be satisfactory but the task could be redesigned.The fol-
lowing information discusses various areas to help maintain a healthy office
environment:
Computer Workstation
You should position your computer, monitor, keyboard, and mouse pad to avoid
stress or strain on your body (see Figure 11). This placement is crucial to your
good health. What seems to be only a minor problem can become a major one
when allowed to go unchecked for months or sometimes years.
18

Computer screen glare or a copy-
holder that does not adjust presents addi-
tional problems. Complaints arise about
eyestrain, backaches, and headaches. The
greatest complaint of office professionals
has been screen glare. Long hours at the
computer can also lead to repetitive mo-
tion illnesses, the most common of which
is carpal tunnel syndrome, a wrist ailment
typically caused by incorrect alignment of
hand and wrist. A wrist pad placed in
front of the keyboard to rest hands when
not keyboarding and a wrist pad attached
to the mouse pad to rest the wrist when
using the mouse helps to alleviate this
problem (Figure 12). Workers also have
to cope with “computer squeal,” a high-
frequency, barely detectable squeal that
some computer terminals emit. This
problem can cause anxiety, headaches,
and nausea.
Desktop Supplies and Equipment
Office equipment such as computer keyboards, under-desk keyboard drawers or
arms, staplers, footrests, anti-glare screens, mice, and mouse pads are all available
with ergonomic features. For instance, one ergonomic keyboard offers features
such as variable separation with up to 17.5 inches of separation between the G and 
H key.There is also unlimited lateral tilt (tenting), in which each keyboard module
can be independently adjusted from zero to ninety degrees, greatly reducing forearm
tension. In addition, unlimited rotation (including negative tilt) is also available.

Unlimited rotation means each keyboard half can be independently rotated to
adapt to a user’s particular needs. The height can be adjusted by lowering up to six
inches below the desk surface.
Décor
Colors that blend tastefully should be used throughout each office area. The color
scheme should be harmonious, but contrasting colors should be used to break the
monotony of look-alike stations. The colors in your work environment can affect
health and productivity as much as a supportive chair. Psychologists know color
can affect a person’s mood, efficiency, and perception of time, temperature, and
noise. Most office planners agree cool tones are best for tasks requiring high lev-
els of concentration; large areas of yellow, bright green, bright red, and dark
brown can have negative effects on workers.
Furniture
Office furniture manufacturers have designed modular furniture to carry out the
office landscape concept. Modular furniture consists of separate components that
can be fitted together in various arrangements to meet the user’s needs. If the
worker’s duties change, creating a need for a change in working surface, the mod-
ular furniture can easily be rearranged.
The chair is one of the most important pieces of furniture in the office.
A poorly designed or maladjusted chair can be a major contributor to poor cir-
culation and stress on the spine, back, and neck. When selecting a chair, consider
the following:
• The seat should be slightly wider than your hips and thighs.
• Most modern chairs can be pneumatically adjusted. You sit on the chair and a
pneumatic lever located under the seat allows you to adjust the seat up or down.
• The chair back should be adjustable up and down and forward and back to ad-
just to your size.
• These seat adjustments allow you to adjust the seat to ensure good circulation
in your legs and feet.
• If you are moving from desk to desk in your workstation, you should have a
chair with a five-pedestal base. This type of base helps to keep the chair from
turning over as you move.
When equipment is set up correctly, the keyboard should be placed at a com-
fortable height that allows the arms and wrists to move without strain. The
monitor should be placed behind the keyboard, positioned so the worker can
look slightly down at the screen. Improper positioning of the monitor can in-
crease glare and affect the worker’s posture and productivity. Office profes-
sionals who require bifocal glasses often complain of neck problems caused by
the angle they must hold their head to see the screen. If you wear bifocals, you
should wear reading glasses to correct this problem or make certain you can
look down to view the monitor. Refer to Figure 11 showing correct positioning
of the equipment and the user.
The Environmental Office
An environmental office is one that is concerned with managing resources so these
resources do not negatively affect the environment. In recent years more and more
companies have increased their commitment to preserving the environment.
An example of commitment can be seen through recycling paper. If your office has
Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
20

Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
not yet committed itself to becoming environmentally conscious, initiate this
change with your team.
• When you must discard paper, ask yourself if the paper can be recycled. Special
paper baskets, boxes, trays, and bins for the collection of recyclable paper
should be set around the office in convenient locations.
• Fax cover sheets are often a waste of paper; they almost always end up in the
wastebasket.Temporary adhesive fax-transmittal labels will often suffice.These
small adhesive notes can be adhered to the first page of the fax and are adequate
when a lot of cover information is not necessary. The adhesive notes can be pur-
chased in office supply stores.
• Although a little more expensive, recycled paper may be purchased.
Ask the office staff to contribute additional ideas about environmental issues that
might pertain to your office that will help everyone to manage their resources.
Continue to explore options.
Work surfaces and chairs should be adjustable. Disk drives should be within
easy reach of the worker.
Creating a good ergonomic working arrangement is important to protecting
your health. Every situation is different, and if you can’t seem to get your arrange-
ment to feel right or you are confused about how to arrange your workstation so
it is ergonomically correct, you should seek professional advice.

Ergonomic Tips
1. Give support to your lower lumbar region of your back to
avoid fatigue and stress on the spine.
2. Use wrist pads to reduce the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.
3. Tilt the seat forward to decrease muscle strain and back
pressure and improve blood circulation.
4. Use a copyholder to minimize head and eye movement and
avoid neck strain.
5. Elevate your feet to take the strain off the legs and back.
6. Tilt the monitor so you are looking down into the monitor
rather than up.
7. If you use a laptop at your desk, place your laptop on the
desk and consider getting a separate monitor or an add-on
pointing device and keyboard.
8. If you fly a lot and use your laptop, you should use the tray
table in front of you. Try to keep your wrists straight and
your elbows at a ninety-degree angle.
9. Even if you use a laptop for casual use, apply all the rules
for it that you would apply for a desktop computer.
10. To avoid end-of-workday aches, pain, or fatigue, stand up
and stretch every twenty minutes for twenty seconds.
International Employment
More and more companies are moving their operations outside the United
States to take advantage of a cheaper labor market. International employment
offers employees the opportunity to work abroad. You might have noticed
many of the products you purchase are made outside the United States. Our
government has also signed trade agreements with other countries that make it
easier for U.S. companies to do business with those countries. One example is
our agreement with Mexico and Canada—the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). This agreement has allowed companies to move some of
its offices or plants to Mexico or Canada, resulting in goods flowing freely
across U.S. borders.
If you consider working abroad, you will see many similarities to employment
in the United States from required skills to job titles. For instance, some job titles
are the same as in the United States; others are only slightly different, as you can
see from the following list:
• receptionist
• secretary
• administration assistant
• medical secretary
• team secretary
• PA (personal assistant) or PA to general manager
• secretary/commercial assistant
• medical transcriptionist

Concept Review and Reinforcement
Review of Concepts
Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
OUTCOME
CONCEPT
1. Describe the purpose of a
company mission statement.
A mission statement defines for employees the company’s goals, strategic intent,
and business direction.
2. Explain the purpose of a
company code of ethics.
A code of ethics is a set of rules governing the behavior of all members of an 
organization. The code of ethics calls for high standards of honesty, objectivity,
diligence, and loyalty.
3. Define and explain the
classifications of authority.
Line organization is where authority flows vertically down within the organiza-
tion. Supervisors control employees immediately below them and usually give 
orders, hire, terminate, and take disciplinary action.
Where line managers use staff specialists to assist them, the organization’s
structure is called a line-and-staff organization. Staff managers usually do not
have authority. They supply information or expertise to specific line managers in
an advisory capacity by making recommendations.
Participatory management is forming project teams to bring together employ-
ees with the talents needed to work on a specified project. Employees are asked
for input about their areas of responsibility and are brought together to discuss
problems and develop solutions.
4. Explain the importance of
developing a good working
relationship with your 
manager.
Building a good relationship with your manager is necessary to be recommended
for promotion, to obtain raises, and/or to be given key assignments. To accom-
plish any or all of these, you must receive good performance evaluations. Your
principal job is to see that your manager succeeds at his or her job. By doing so
you are contributing to the company’s mission through the work you do.
5. Explain the role of the 
office professional.
You should understand your role in the company because you will be expected to
contribute to the company’s overall mission. You should be familiar with current job
titles such as administrative assistant, executive assistant, executive secretary, office
manager or supervisor, and secretary; be ready to telecommute if asked; or become a
virtual assistant to assist entrepreneurs with such tasks as desktop publishing, Inter-
net research, event planning and reminder services, word processing, travel arrange-
ments, technical writing and grant proposal writing, bookkeeping, and marketing
support. You should be knowledgeable about the office of the future, Internet re-
search, desktop publishing, computer training, Web site management, and the likely
increase in mobile offices allowing office professionals to work anywhere.
6. Identify common office 
support functions.
Routine functions: require minimal original thinking; include essential skills such
as filing (document storage and retrieving with emphasis on electronic record
keeping), photocopying, coordinating direct mailings, and keeping logs.
Technical functions: require judgment and advanced office skills, such as a
high level of document preparation and proficiency using various software appli-
cations, including spreadsheets, databases, project management, and presentations
(creating and presenting).
Analytical functions: require critical and creative thinking and decision-making
skills, such as creating and analyzing reports and planning meetings and special events.
Interpersonal functions: require judgment, analytical (decision making), and
people skills, such as coordinating a team project or quickly establishing rapport
with team members and identifying and responding to preferred work styles and
personality traits.
25

Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
OUTCOME
CONCEPT
Managerial functions: require planning (analytical); organizing (analytical); 
measuring (analytical); using Internet/intranet and communications for research,
interviewing, orienting, and supervising.
7. Define the elements of
appropriate ergonomic 
design in the workplace.
Ergonomics is the science of fitting the workplace to meet the physical needs of
the employee in office layout, décor, furniture selected, and position of the com-
puter and monitor.
Long hours at the computer can lead to repetitive motion illnesses, the most
common of which is carpal tunnel syndrome.
When selecting a chair, consider the following: The seat should be slightly
wider than your hips and thighs; make sure you can adjust the seat up or down;
the back should be adjustable; for your safety you should have a chair with a five-
pedestal base; make sure the keyboard is placed at a comfortable height and al-
lows your arms and wrists to move without strain; make sure the monitor is
placed behind the keyboard, positioned so that you can look slightly down at the
screen; if you wear bifocals, be sure to adjust the chair or seat so your neck is not
strained when looking at the monitor or can look down to view the monitor. Your
work surface should also be adjustable.
Office equipment such as computer keyboards, under-desk keyboard drawers
or arms, staplers, footrests, anti-glare screens, mice, and mouse pads are all avail-
able with ergonomic features.

Introduction
These situations are designed to help you develop one 
of the most important workplace skills identified by
employers—thinking skills. Developing these skills re-
quires that a person
• think creatively by generating new ideas;
• make decisions by specifying goals and constraints,
generating alternatives, considering risks, and evaluat-
ing and choosing the best alternatives;
• solve problems;
• learn by using efficient learning techniques to acquire
and apply new knowledge and skills; and
• reason by discovering a rule or principle underlying
the relationship between two or more objects and ap-
ply it when solving a problem.
You will learn more about developing critical think-
ing skills in Chapter 3.
Each chapter has at least four case studies in which
you will be asked to generate new ideas, evaluate and
choose the best alternative, recognize problems, and de-
vise a plan of action. Be specific in your responses.

tant, has worked for the Army/Air Force Exchange
Service (AAFES) for five years and has just com-
pleted her performance evaluation. The one area for
improvement revealed in her review session is to
demonstrate ways in which she could support the
mission of the organization. Although Cindi earned
7 out of 10 on the rating scale, she wanted to im-
prove her rating on the next performance review.
The mission statement for AAFES is “To provide
quality goods and services at competitively low
prices and generate earnings to supplement appro-
priated funds for military morale, welfare, and recre-
ation (MWR) programs.” Why is it important for
Cindi to understand the organization’s mission
statement? Cindi’s goal is to receive a higher rating
on her next performance review. How can she
demonstrate her support for the organization’s mis-
sion to receive a higher rating?
2. Company’s structure. Because of the economic crisis
companies are facing today, there has been a sharp
decline in worker confidence in business. Concerns
about loss of benefits, cut in pay, and fear of losing
a job has had a negative impact on morale. How can
a company’s mission statement, code of ethics,

area to visit and identify the company’s organiza-
tional structure.
a. Obtain a copy of the company’s organization
chart and be prepared to present your
findings to the class.
b. If the company you selected does not have an
organization chart, ask for a copy from a
friend’s or relative’s company. Be prepared to
discuss your findings with the class.
3. Look in the newspaper and locate at least three job ti-
tles used in your area for office positions for which you
are now qualified or for which you may in the near fu-
ture be qualified. Using a memo format, list the office
support functions discussed in the chapter required for
each job title. For example, administrative assistant—
identify specific analytical, interpersonal, and manage-
rial functions. Include the source of your information.
4. As a team select an office in which one team mem-
ber works or set up an interview with someone in an
office to evaluate the office layout, décor, furniture,
and computer arrangement to determine if the office
is ergonomically meeting the physical and psycholog-
ical needs of the employee. Create a set of questions
using the list shown in the Stop ’n Check 5. Write a
memo to your instructor about your findings. In-
clude in the memo your questions, answers, and a
table that outlines the items evaluated and whether
they met or did not meet the specifications mentioned
in this chapter. Identify the department and title of
the person you interviewed. Do not include the com-
pany or the person’s name. Should you have difficulty
finding an office, ask your instructor about using an

3. Telecommuting. David Morgan accepted the op-
portunity to telecommute and work from his home.
His company provided all the office equipment and
paid for a dedicated fax/phone line with voice mail
and all his office supplies. He agreed to do the same
work at home that he was doing in the office. He
was to have all his work completed and submitted
by Friday of each week. Friday was the only day he
had to report to the office each week, and on that
day he was busy with conferences and meetings af-
ter turning in his work. Jana, one of David’s cowork-
ers, called him several times during an eight-week
period to ask business questions but was never able
to speak with him. Jana reported this to David’s
manager and commented she thought David was
traveling more than working. Was Jana correct in re-
porting David? If so, why, and if not, why not? What
were some of the assumptions Jana made? What do
you think motivated Jana to do what she did? What
do you think David’s manager said to Jana? What do
you think David’s manager said to him?
4. Chain of command. Your company has a manufactur-
ing plant in Mexico City. You do not have to commu-
nicate with this plant to do your job, but Chikondi,
whose office is next to yours, is required to communi-
cate daily with the office in Mexico City to clarify and
resolve problems. Chikondi speaks Spanish fluently
and has established a successful working relationship
with those in the Mexico City office.Milan,another of-
fice assistant, resents all the laughing and talking
Chikondi does. She complains that she can’t do her
work because of it. She tells you she plans to go to
Chikondi’s supervisor and complain, and if she doesn’t
get results at that level of authority, she will go to a
higher level. She has asked you to support her should
the supervisor ask any questions. What would you say
to Milan about your involvement? What would you
recommend Milan do if the situation is disturbing her
work? What do you think Milan’s supervisor’s response
will be? To Chikondi? What do you think the supervi-
sor would say if Milan went over his or her head to a
higher authority if the problem was not resolved?
Using the Web: Research Activities
The World Wide Web, also known as the Web, comprises
a vast collection of documents stored in specialized com-
puters all over the world. These computers are linked to
form part of a worldwide communication system called
the Internet. When you conduct a search, you direct your
computer’s browser, such as Mozilla Firefox or Mi-
crosoft® Internet Explorer, to go to Web sites where doc-
uments are stored and retrieve the requested information
for display on your screen. The Internet is the communi-
cation system by which the information travels.
A search tool is a computer program that performs
searches. A search method is the way a search tool re-
quests and retrieves information from a Web site.
In your searches, you will use any one or all of the
following popular tools:
• Yahoo!, known as a directory search, uses both subject
and keyword search methods. Choose a subject search
when you want general information on a subject or
topic.
• Google searches for information through use of key-
words, such as “office trends” and responds with a list
of references or hits. Choose a keyword search method
to obtain specific information as its database is substan-
tially larger and more current than that of a directory
search, such as Yahoo!.
If you are new to searching the Web, follow this gen-
eral procedure:
• Connect to the Internet via your browser (Mozilla
Firefox or Internet Explorer).
• In the browser’s location box, type the address (URL)
of your search tool choice. Press Enter.The Home Page
of the search tool appears on your screen. The ad-
dresses for two popular search tools are:
• www.yahoo.com
• www.google.com
• Type your query in the address box at the top of the
screen. Press Enter.
• The matching references are displayed on your screen.
The references returned are called hits and are ranked
according to how well they match your query.
• Use this style to reference all Web sites:

and locate three items from the list of ergonom-
ically designed desktop office equipment or
supplies.
2.
Research two additional ergonomically designed
items that are not in the list.

formation you could use in your presentation.
3.
Outline the information to be included in your
presentation.
Tip: Use the outline feature of your word process-
ing software to present the information.
completing a workshop exercise, spend some time review-
ing the specific rule(s) and examples for the chapter.
Rule 1: Commas Used with Conjunctions
Commas are placed before coordinating conjunctions
when they separate two independent clauses in a com-
pound sentence. Examples of coordinating conjunctions
are nor, for, yet, so, or, and, and but.
Dave is a good programmer, and he has been given
the lead programmer’s job for a month’s trial.
If clauses are short and related, you may omit the comma
before and.
30

Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
Tip: Therefore, however, and accordingly are not consid-
ered true coordinating conjunctions. Use a semicolon be-
fore these words, not a comma.
Rule 2: Commas Used with Nonrestrictive Words,
Phrases, and Clauses
A word, phrase, or clause that is not absolutely essential
to a sentence may be set off in commas. Restrictive
words, phrases, and clauses are essential to the meaning
of the sentence and are not set off by commas.
Word. The meeting,however, ran well into the evening.
Phrase. Mrs. Gonzales, the data processing coordi-
nator [nonrestrictive], retired after twenty-five years
with the company.

Simulation In the Office 
at Supreme Appliances
Welcome to Supreme Appliances, Inc. You are presently
completing an internship and have been hired as an ad-
ministrative assistant to support Amanda Quevedo, vice
president of the Marketing Division. Your internship is
a part-time job in which you will receive supervised
practical training in the office technology field. The in-
ternship is closely related to your academic and career
goals and will serve as a precursor to professional em-
ployment. You will be closely supervised by your men-
tor,
Amanda Quevedo,
in an apprenticeship-like
relationship until you complete your internship. This in-
ternship provides you with academic credit as well as
hourly pay.
Ms. Quevedo will delegate tasks to be completed, su-
pervise your work, and evaluate your performance. You
have completed your orientation for interns and are be-
ginning your first official day.
The assignments you receive will help you build
skills that are similar to the ones you will face in today’s
office. At times you will be given assignments that will
require you to use initiative or that may require clarifi-
cation or additional information. Although employers
notice employees using initiative, as an intern you will
need to ask for additional information to complete the
assignment. It’s much better to ask for additional detail
and complete the work accurately and in a timely man-
ner than to complete a task and do it wrong and have to
do it again.
Before you begin your tasks, note the following in-
formation about your company:
Supreme Appliances, Inc., sells both large and small
home appliances. It also manufactures its own line of
refrigerators, stoves, freezers, and dishwashers. Henry
Pippen serves as president of Supreme Appliances, Inc.,
and his administrative assistant is Kirk Lawrence.
The company address is:
14 Shady Lane
Rochester, NY 14623
The marketing division measures and analyzes market
potential and assists in short- and long-range fore-
casting. The division’s organization chart is shown in
Figure 8.
From the chart, you can see the vice president sup-
ports divisions in four regions: Eastern, Southwestern,
Northwestern, and Western. Each region is supported by
a sales office. In addition to these regions, Supreme has
two manufacturing plants.

Your office uses a network system that connects all
of the offices and plants. Therefore, you will be able to
communicate with all the appropriate personnel through-
out the organization.
Your job will entail prioritizing office tasks; com-
posing letters and e-mails; processing incoming and out-
going mail; handling the telephone; planning meetings
and conferences; welcoming visitors; keyboarding other
documents, such as agendas and meeting notes; schedul-
ing appointments; and making travel arrangements.
On occasion, you will be asked to assist the office
support staff in other offices to help handle the workflow.

Building Your Portfolio
Introduction to Creating 
Your Employment Portfolio
Finding the right job for you in today’s competitive job mar-
ket can sometimes be difficult. You have to do more than
what is expected of you to make a lasting impression dur-
ing an interview. During your study of office procedures,
you will be creating sample documents that can present
your skills to an interviewer much better than words. You
will be creating your employment portfolio, chapter by
chapter, so you can show an interviewer the quality of work
you are capable of producing.
What Is an Employment Portfolio?
An employment portfolio is a collection of samples of
your best work arranged in an attractive binder or file
folder—whatever you choose—that will demonstrate
your organization, writing, and critical thinking skills. Re-
member the key word is best. You would not want to in-
clude any work that has errors, is unattractive, or is
unclear to the reader. For example, an organization chart
you have created using Microsoft® Word is a great exam-
ple showing your ability to use the special chart feature in
the word processing software. Other samples of your
work may include a resume, cover letter, and completed
application form.
What Is the Purpose of the Portfolio?
The collection presents your abilities in a much stronger,
more positive way than your describing the work you
are capable of doing. Its purpose is to build confidence
in your skills, knowledge, and abilities in the inter-
viewer’s mind.
• Receiving telephone calls
• Placing international telephone calls
• Keeping confidential information confidential

34

Understanding the Changing and Challenging Office
The following suggestions may help you in preparing
a portfolio:
• Make your portfolio speak for you. If your employ-
ment portfolio is clean, complete, and carefully or-
ganized, that’s how you will be judged. If it’s unique,
colorful, creative, and imaginative, that, too, is how
you will be judged. So, too, will you be judged if your
folder or binder is messy, incomplete, and haphaz-
ardly put together. Before giving your portfolio to
someone else for evaluation, consider whether it re-
flects how you want to be presented.
• Attend to the mechanics of the portfolio. Make cer-
tain the folder containing your documents is the kind
specified and that it is clean and attractive. In the ab-
sence of any specification, use a pocket folder, which
is an inexpensive means of keeping the contents or-
ganized and secure. Put your name and address on
the outside cover. Organize the material inside as re-
quested. And submit it on time.
• Include exactly what is requested. If your instructor
wants three finished copies, that’s the minimum your
portfolio should contain. If an employer wants to see
five samples of different kinds of documents, be sure
to include five samples.
• Add supplemental material judiciously. If you believe
supplemental documents will present you in a better
light, include that too, but only after the required ma-
terial. If you include extra material, attach a note to
explain why it is there. Supplemental documents
might include letters, graphics, diagrams, or spread-
sheets that suggest other useful dimensions of your
thinking and abilities.
• Include perfect final documents. Show that your own
standard for finished work is high. Final documents
should be printed on high-quality paper, be carefully
proofread, and follow common formats.
• Demonstrate growth. The signal value of portfolios
is they allow you to demonstrate how a finished doc-
ument came into being. Consequently, your instruc-
tor may ask for drafts to be attached to final
documents, the most recent on top, so he or she can
see how you followed revision suggestions and how
much effort you invested. To build such a record of
your work, date every draft of each document.
• Demonstrate work in progress. It may be that you
present partially finished work that suggests future
directions and intentions. Both your instructor and
future employer may find such preliminary work
valuable. When you include such tentative drafts or
incomplete work, be sure to attach a note explaining
why it’s not quite finished.
• Attach a table of contents. For portfolios containing
more than three documents, attach a separate table
of contents. For those containing only a few papers,
embed your table of contents in the cover letter. For
this class, create a table of contents listing chapter
number and name.
• Include a cover letter. The cover letter represents your
most recent assessment of the work you completed,
serving two primary purposes: (1) as an introduction
explaining the portfolio’s contents and (2) as your self-
assessment of the quality of the work. Based on your
instructor’s directions, your cover letter may be com-
pleted at the end of this class.
• Include your resume. In today’s less certain and ever-
changing marketplace dynamic personal marketing
strategies are even more important. Make certain
your resume touches on critical areas that are your
best selling points related to the job for which you
are applying. Be sure to use key words from the ad-
vertised job description and show how your skills di-
rectly relate to that job. The resume should be a
perfect picture of your best work. You will create
your resume later in this text.
• Include letters of reference. Interviewers may not
have had time to send for references. Reference let-
ters from college instructors and from supervisors
with whom you have worked can offer the inter-
viewer a head start on knowing the kind of employee
you will be.
• Include any certifications you have. Examples might
be Microsoft®
Certified Applications Specialist
(MCAS) or certificates from other training or work-
shops you have attended.
Adapted from The Blair Handbook (5th ed.), by
Toby Fulwiler and Alan R. Hayakawa. Prentice Hall,
2006, pp. 226–267.
1. With the help of a team member or your instructor,
select the best work from the following:
• Exploring the Workplace: Activities. Explain what
you were to do in the activity, your approach to
completing the activity, what you learned from the
activity, and how you can apply the results of the
activity to your own employment.
• Simulation: In the Office at Supreme Appliances.
Include the two organization charts you created.
2. Make certain that you include the question,situation,or
an explanation of what your assignment was so an in-
terviewer could tell what work you were required to do
and what your final response or document looks like.
As you complete the assignments in each of the chap-
ters, keep in mind the document(s) you will want to
showcase in your portfolio as it will represent YOU!

evaluated, a rubric is provided.To download this data file,

Developing Professional Skills
B
usiness and industry representatives are becoming more and more concerned
about the gap between the workplace skill requirements for entry-level
employment and the workplace skill levels of most entry-level applicants.
Employers are finding most applicants possess adequate hard skills, also called
technical skills, but many applicants lack what is often referred to as soft skills
necessary for success on the job. These soft skills include personal qualities such as
being responsible,being dependable,being a self-starter,having a positive self-esteem,
being sociable, exhibiting self-management, displaying integrity/honesty, projecting
a pleasant personality, showing your human side, and projecting a professional
image. Soft skills also include interpersonal skills (interaction with others), which
you will learn about later in this chapter, such as participating as a team member,
teaching others, interacting with customers, demonstrating leadership ability,
negotiating agreements, and respecting diversity. Employers are looking for all these
skills in entry-level applicants.
Identifying Technical Skills
In Figure 1 you will notice four technical skills, six knowledge skills, and ten per-
sonal qualities required for job success. Although the purpose of this chapter is to
focus on soft skills, which include both personal qualities and a variety of inter-
personal skills, a review of all the skills is necessary because each one is important.
RESOURCES
You must be skillful in locating and managing resources. Managing resources
involves identifying, organizing, planning, and allocating resources. Examples of
resources are time, money, material and facilities, and human resource manage-
ment.
INFORMATION
You must be skillful in managing information. Managing information means
acquiring, evaluating, organizing, maintaining, interpreting, and communicating.
You must also use computers to process information.
Always be on the lookout for information that quickly allows you to identify
a problem so you can make the adjustment and correct it before it becomes too
late to make a correction. For instance, develop your proofreading skills to the
point where you want to find errors, not just speed read and skim a document so
you can quickly move to another.
You should understand there is a great deal of difference between employment
(having a job) and employability (possessing the qualities necessary to maintain
employment). Possessing excellent human relation skills, both personal and inter-
personal, will enable you to project an image of professionalism that will cause
you to be viewed as an asset to your company. When you lack these soft skills,
often “having a job” can be temporary.
The purpose of this chapter is to emphasize the two areas of soft skills em-
ployers are most concerned about employees possessing—personal qualities and
interpersonal skills. In this chapter and throughout this text, you will learn more
about the soft skills necessary to succeed in today’s office.

FIGURE 1 • Workplace skills necessary to succeed in today’s office.
SYSTEMS
You must understand how social, organizational, and technological systems work
and operate effectively within them. This means monitoring and correcting
performance and often improving and designing simple systems. Always look for
better ways to do a job. Often a simple change in a procedure can save the com-
pany time and money and just might get you promoted.
TECHNOLOGY
You must be able to work with a variety of technologies, which involves selecting
procedures, tools, or equipment, including computers and related technologies.
You should understand the intended use of the technology and the proper proce-
dures for its setup and operation as well as how to maintain and troubleshoot
problems. Take advantage of any training that comes your way to stay up to date
on software, equipment, and other technologies. Don’t wait until you need to
know then have to say “I wish I had gone to that training that was offered.” Be
ready when you have the opportunity.

Developing Knowledge Skills
BASIC KNOWLEDGE SKILLS
Basic knowledge skills such as thinking, reading, writing, performing mathemati-
cal operations, listening, and speaking are also identified in Figure 1 as important
workplace skills. A basic mastery of these skills is required to obtain any job.
Employers have expressed that more emphasis should be placed on develop-
ing listening, speaking, and thinking skills prior to entering the workforce. This
chapter emphasizes how you can improve your thinking skills. Now let’s begin by
focusing on developing stronger thinking skills.
THINKING SKILLS
How could any office professional not possess thinking skills? Of course,everyone pos-
sesses thinking skills.The term thinking skills refers to the degree to which a person can
use these skills to arrive at a decision or develop a viable solution to a problem.
Your supervisor may expect you to use your ability to think of new creative
ideas, make decisions, solve problems, visualize abstractly, or just know how to
learn or reason. An office professional should develop these skills and know when
to use each one. Take a moment to review the following list of ways you may be
required to solve a problem on the job.
Stop ’n Check 1
List the four basic workplace skills.

d. ____________________________________________________________________________________________
Creative thinking
Generate a new idea.
Decision making
Specify goals and constraints, generate alternatives,
consider risks, and evaluate and choose best
alternatives.
Problem solving
Recognize problems and devices and implement a
plan of action.
Visualizing
Organize and process symbols or other items.
Knowing how to learn
Use efficient learning techniques to acquire and apply
new knowledge and skills.
Reasoning
Discover a rule or principle underlying the
relationship between two or more objects and apply
it to solve a problem.
How should you go about developing better thinking skills? The best way is to use
these skills every time an opportunity presents itself. Here are some basic steps you
can use to begin.
42

Developing Professional Skills
Example
You work as an office assistant in the security department. This department
oversees the employee parking facilities. Your supervisor has received many
complaints that the employee parking lot is too small.Your supervisor will add the
expenditures in this year’s budget to solve the problem. He has asked you to chair
a committee to study the problem and present to him the committee’s ideas and
recommendation(s). See Figure 2.
1. Gather all the information about the problem.
2. Determine what you know about the problem already that might be helpful
in forming a solution.
3. Determine if more information is needed and where to get it.
4. Outline all possible solutions, whether right or wrong.
5. Analyze each solution, discarding those you know are wrong and narrow
your choices to two or three when possible.
6. Identify the pros and cons for each solution.
7. Select the best solution among the choices.
Here is an example of how these steps might work.
Developing Personal Qualities
When you accept a position with a company, management expects you to do the
best job you can and to get along with everyone to the best of your ability.
Remember that your contribution is essential to a smooth-running, productive,
and efficient office. By upholding a high standard of personal qualities, called soft
skills, you will demonstrate excellent human relations skills to those around you,
and your role will become a central one on the office team (see Figure 3).
By applying the steps laid out in Figure 2 when you are faced with a problem,
you can improve your ability to think logically and systematically. As with other
skills, knowing the process and practicing are the keys to success.

Example
Nothing went right this morning for you. The coffee pot decided to quit working,
the children dragged around until the last minute to get dressed for school, you
had forgotten to pick up the dry cleaning and didn’t have the pair of pants you
wanted to wear, and the gas gage in the car was almost on empty.What more could
go wrong! Well, being late for work when your supervisor was having a meeting
with the department heads, and you were to prepare the meeting room. Were you
being dependable?
Developing Professional Skills
Example
You have really been busy this week at work. The phone was constantly inter-
rupting your work, several customers had problems you had to handle, and you
had a huge project that had been assigned to you two months ago on which you
have been procrastinating. You hate to tell your supervisor how behind you are on
the project. Are you being responsible? What could you have done differently to
show responsibility?
BE RESPONSIBLE
Responsibility means accepting the assignment of duties. When you accept a posi-
tion, you are being entrusted with and assigned many duties to be performed. You
are expected to perform these duties to the best of your ability. To be responsible,
you must answer to someone for your actions, and on the job this means your
supervisor. Displaying responsibility is one of the key personal qualities of an
office professional.
BE DEPENDABLE
Dependability means being consistent and reliable in your behavior. For instance,
you would display dependability by having an excellent attendance record and by
being prompt in arriving at work each morning and in returning on time to your
workstation after breaks and lunch. Dependability helps create a desirable office
atmosphere.
Each employee in your office depends on every person being there. When
someone is absent, no matter the reason, or is late returning from lunch or a break,
someone in the office must cover for that person. When someone is covering for
another individual, that someone is not getting his or her own work completed.
Hostile feelings can grow quickly toward any person who does not carry his or her
workload and is not dependable.
BE A SELF-STARTER
A self-starter takes the initiative to begin a task for which he or she is responsible.
Don’t wait for your manager to ask you to do something—be observant and
anticipate what you are expected to do without having to be told.
When you finish your work, ask if you can help someone else. Everyone feels
overworked and underpaid, and when someone sits idly by while others are
swamped, a negative attitude toward the person who is not busy builds. You can’t
just say,“It isn’t my job,” because it is your job to help anyone at any time you are
not busy. You are paid to work a full day’s work, and you should project the image
of always wanting to help when help is needed.
46

Example
What if you have not had a moment to take a break and very little time to eat
lunch. In fact, you have eaten your lunch at your desk all week while working.You
take the initative and are self-motivated and work hard to get your work done.
You finally get a breather, but just now Amy, who works down the hall from you,
comes by and asks if there was any way you could handle a ten-page document
for her. She is trying to get some crucial information out to all the department
heads before an important staff meeting tomorrow. Amy is always behind and
needing help, and you feel if she planned better, she could do her work without
always being rushed. Should you refuse or help her?
DEVELOP POSITIVE 
SELF-ESTEEM
Self-esteem is the opinion you have of yourself. The following list identifies some
of the concepts that affect your self-esteem:
• the value you place on yourself as a person;
• the opinion you believe others hold of you;
• your strengths and weaknesses;
• your social status and how you relate to others;
• your independence and your ability to be independent.
Low self-esteem is when you view one or more of these items negatively, which
results in a poor self-image. High self-esteem is just the opposite and causes you to
be confident, sure of yourself, and possess a good attitude toward your ability to
succeed. Having positive self-esteem is critical to your living a happy life both at
home and in the workplace. A person who is self-confident relies on the correct-
ness of his or her own judgment and competence in spite of the discouragement
and influence of others. A confident person maintains composure, which is a feel-
ing of calmness and tranquility, and exhibits poise, which denotes ease and dignity
of manner. Here are some ways to become confident:
1. Believe in yourself and your ability to take on new and challenging assign-
ments. Tell yourself you can do any task given you. When you have a prob-
lem, you can always ask for help.
2. Do not expect to control the circumstances under which you work; they are
beyond your control. You can remain in control of your reactions, however.
Don’t overreact to minor problems. Just say to yourself,“This too shall pass,”
and do your best.
3. Accept that the business world is demanding and fast-paced. Take one thing
at a time. To cope with a heavy workload, proceed with assurance and keep
your cool.
4. Be patient, take time to distinguish between fact and fiction, and withhold
judgment until you have all the facts.
5. Accept criticism; in fact, welcome it. Use it as a tool to help improve your skills
and knowledge.
6. Develop a sense of humor. Laugh at yourself and laugh with others. Do not
take yourself or your problems too seriously.

FIGURE 4 • Being social among your coworkers helps develop 
a positive office environment.
Example
Well, you did it again! You didn’t order the cake early enough so the bakery could
have it in time for your supervisor’s retirement party this afternoon. Everyone is
going to be so disappointed. You seem to always do things like this. How do you
feel about yourself?
BE SOCIABLE
Sociability demonstrates understanding, friendliness, adaptability, empathy, and
politeness in group settings. Some employees develop social bonds with certain
coworkers. You may find others with whom you work who have interests similar
to your own and because of these similar interests you will become closer and
friendlier toward them.You should, however, strive to be friendly toward each per-
son in your work group (see Figure 4). A pleasant smile and an acknowledgment
of each one as you work will continually show others that you are a friendly, pleas-
ant coworker.
Always take part in office get-togethers such as birthday celebrations, lunches,
or holiday celebrations. Your attendance and participation is part of your belong-
ing to the office group and showing your desire to support one another.
Example
You are the president’s administrative assistant. You hate to go to company par-
ties. You are quiet and efficient at work but don’t like to make small talk with
people you don’t really know.And, you have to dress up and don’t have the clothes
you believe you need to wear to a company party like this one. What would hap-
pen if you didn’t go?
48

Developing Professional Skills
EXHIBIT SELF-MANAGEMENT
Self-management means that you set personal goals, monitor your progress, assess
yourself accurately, and exhibit self-control.Your goals may be for self-improvement
in certain areas,attempting something new,or working on a problem you might have.
When you are faced with difficult situations in the workplace, you should
always exhibit self-control. You know yourself better than anyone else; therefore,
if this is an area you need to work on, set self-management goals to develop the ability
to react as you should in stressful situations.When you are in a tense situation, stop
and think before you speak. Give yourself time to analyze the reaction of others to
what you might say. This time can allow you to organize your thoughts and re-
sponse, help you develop the desired attitude, and avoid reacting inappropriately.
You should seek to cultivate attitudes and traits that will contribute to your
success. When you succeed in displaying an appropriate attitude or trait in a diffi-
cult situation, you will be able to apply that experience in coping with the next dif-
ficult situation.
DISPLAY INTEGRITY/HONESTY
Integrity and honesty mean the same thing—being sincere and trustworthy. No one
wants to work with someone who does not possess these characteristics. The lack
of these characteristics can lead to termination of employment. Just as you set these
standards for yourself, you should expect the same standards from everyone with
whom you work. Integrity encompasses sound moral or ethical principles, fairness,
honesty, sincerity, and the courage to stand up for these moral precepts. Strength of
character and integrity are among the most important traits a person can possess.
Example
Your boss was having a bad day. When you didn’t let her know immediately that
a client had canceled an appointment, she got upset and raised her voice to you,
explaining she didn’t want this to happen again. She wanted to know immediately
when a client canceled so she could quickly make other plans. You felt like telling
her just what you thought of the way she spoke to you. What would have hap-
pened if you had?
Example
You are the administrative assistant for one of the vice presidents of the bank. You
are in charge of the petty cash fund. No one else can use money from the fund
except for business purposes. But, since you have access to the fund, you often put
an IOU in the fund and borrow money from it until the next day or so. Today, the
accounting auditors came.Their job is to audit money at the bank.They spot count
several tellers’ cash trays, the money in the vault, and, as luck would have it, your
petty cash fund. How are you going to explain what you have been doing?
PROJECT A PLEASANT PERSONALITY
Personality is what you are, the sum of all your mental, physical, and emotional
experiences. Everyone’s personality is affected by the experiences of daily living.
Psychologists tell us that one’s personality is formed early in life, yet at no time is
one’s personality completely fixed. Changes in personality take place gradually,
but they do occur; therefore, personality development or improvement is possible.
49

Developing Professional Skills
Projecting a pleasant personality is easy when things go right. To be successful
in business, you must be able to:
• Maintain composure when things go wrong.
• Say “no” tactfully when you must.
• Soothe the feelings of an irate customer or coworker.
• Be considerate and tolerant of someone who is inconsiderate of you.
• Exhibit poise under extreme pressure.
• Be patient and try to understand people with different personalities.
SHOW YOUR HUMAN SIDE
A friendly smile and cheerful “good morning” may be classified as ceremonial lan-
guage, but they are highly desirable when they are coupled with sincerity and an
optimistic approach to life. Take the initiative to speak first; call others by name.
Make an effort to get acquainted with as many coworkers as possible.
Try to be the coworker you would want everyone else to be. Here are some
tips to reach that goal:
• Be pleasant, courteous, responsive, and understanding.
• Listen attentively when someone is talking with you.
• Be responsive to what is going on around you.
• Treat others as you wish to be treated.
• Avoid being condescending when giving instructions.
• Suggest rather than command; request rather than demand.
• Show consideration for others in all the things you do, both large and small.
• Be thoughtful; for instance, stop at the office professional’s desk when you must
go in to see his or her manager.
• When you must interrupt someone, time the interruption so that the person is
at a stopping point when you ask for his or her attention.
• Respect the rights of others.
• Do not discuss religion, money, morals, personalities, or politics in the office.
Knowing what not to say is as important as knowing what to say.
• Gain the trust of others by never talking about anyone. Be especially careful not
to make remarks about coworkers.
• Be polite enough not to pry into personal affairs; avoid asking personal
questions.
• When you are talking, take the time to say exactly what you intend to say but
be tactful.
Example
You work with a coworker who has a perpetual scowl on her face at all times. It
isn’t that she is mad or unhappy—it is just the way her face looks. Because of this
look, you have heard several others remark about how mad or hateful she looks
all the time. She is a very good employee who is very efficient and competent. She
tells you she is going to apply for the office manager’s job that has just come open.
You know how the other employees feel about her. Should you say anything to her
about what you know? If so, what would you say and how would you say it?
50

Developing Professional Skills
FIGURE 5 • Take advantage of every opportunity to show your
knowledge and skills.
• Think and then speak; otherwise, your statements may come out wrong and
place you in an embarrassing position.
• Be cooperative and do more than is expected of you.
• Be generous but not to the point of punishing yourself.
Remember that little things do count. You can create a pleasant, businesslike
atmosphere for you and your manager by your rapport with the employees at all
levels and with outsiders who come to your office or call on the telephone. Be con-
sistent, not moody, as you show your human side. In addition to creating a pleasant
atmosphere, your thoughtfulness will help you enjoy your relationships with others.
PROJECT A PROFESSIONAL IMAGE
What is professionalism? Professionalism is aspiring to meet the highest possible
standards of your profession rather than a set of minimum requirements. Notice
the picture in Figure 5 in which the administrative assistant has agreed to give a
presentation. Embrace these opportunities rather than shying away from them.
First impressions are everything, and the first impression you want to make is
by projecting a positive professional image. A professional image reflects:
• an educated and skilled employee;
• a team player who contributes valuable ideas;
Example
You make it a point to say “good morning” or “good afternoon” to each person
you meet each day. You try to have a smile on your face and treat each person as
if they were important to you.You are professional, efficient, and businesslike with
customers. What are the advantages of your being this way?
51

Developing Professional Skills
• a polished individual whose appearance and communication style are “professional”;
• a person who can solve problems and integrate ideas;
• a person who takes pride in each piece of work he or she produces;
• an employee who works for the betterment of the organization and is not self-
serving;
• a person who takes pride in his or her career and who has aspirations for the future;
• an employee who manages assignments by applying quality standards;
• an employee who is willing to work hard and accept new and more challenging
responsibilities;
• an employee who is willing to learn and grow professionally;
• one who seeks to learn about professional organizations such as the
International Association of Administrative Professionals (IAAP).
Sir Walter Scott said,“Success or failure is caused more by mental attitude than
by mental capacity.” You should approach life and your job with a positive atti-
tude. Periodically take inventory of your needs and your accomplishments. Set
new goals and keep reaching. Your rewards will be many, including physical
vitality, an alert mind, and an optimistic attitude toward life.
Example
You practice being the best employee you can be. You are indeed a very efficient
professional in every way. You are goal oriented and know what you want. You
plan to complete your bachelor’s degree within the year. You are proud of all
your achievements. Do you think this image can be thought of as pushy or over-
confident or that you think more of yourself than you should? If so, why? If
not, why?

Developing Interpersonal Skills
To be an effective office professional, you must be aware at all times each person
you meet, whether customer or coworker, is forming an image of the organization,
your manager, and you. You must rely on your business personality to communi-
cate effectively with everyone you come in contact with in your business activities.
You cannot depend on knowledge, skills, and abilities alone for success in your
job. Your performance as an effective office professional and your happiness on
the job will be closely linked to your ability to communicate and to get along with
people. This in turn will depend on your understanding the importance of inter-
personal skills. Let’s consider what happened to an office assistant named Violeta:
Example
Violeta was one of several office assistants at a large travel agency in downtown
Denver. The manager and assistant manager were discussing which of the office as-
sistants should be promoted to office manager to replace the present office man-
ager, who had been promoted to travel agent after she received her certification.The
manager mentioned that Violeta should be selected for the office manager position.
He stated that she had less experience than the other four office assistants and had
adequate technical skills, but she would make a great office manager. The assistant
manager said he thought that Anita would make a better office manager. Anita
knew more about the computer system being used and had several years of experi-
ence with the travel agency. The first manager said,“I agree about Anita’s technical
skills and experience, but I have personally seen Violeta resolve several difficult
problems. She has terrific people skills and works really well with customers as well
as the rest of the office staff.”The assistant manager said,“Yes, you are right. Let’s
promote Violeta. We can keep Anita in mind as our second choice.”
Situations like this happen all the time in the workplace.Often a person is promoted
simply because he or she has good interpersonal skills combined with adequate techni-
cal skills. You should strive to display good interpersonal skills at all times. Do not de-
pend solely on your technical skills and knowledge, even if they are superior skills.
Interpersonal skills are not just getting along with people, however. These skills
are more than that. Here are some of the interpersonal skills to help you succeed in
the workplace. Figure 6 shows how you can improve your interpersonal skills by
working on one skill at a time. The reward is projecting a professional image.
BE A TEAM PLAYER
In every company, management expects each employee to be a productive worker
whose efforts contribute to the goals and objectives of the organization. You and
your manager should be working for common goals and functioning in harmony
with others in the organization.
If you will think in terms of what you can contribute rather than of what you
can get, you will find it easier to do the right thing at the right time. You may per-
form much detailed work, but you need not feel subservient. On the contrary, you
should feel that you are part of a team. Teamwork means collaboration with another
employee(s) assigned a task or goal for which the team must be cooperatively work-
ing together to arrive at a solution or recommendation (see Figure 7). Teamwork
ranks with communication and trust as components for a good relationship with

your manager. Communication is highly important; keep your manager informed.
Because your role is to assist, do everything possible to assist your manager in being
successful. Here are some helpful ways you can be a team player:
• Take full responsibility for your part of the workload and for the problems that
arise within the scope of the team’s work.
• Study your part of the assignment but ask for help from other team members
when necessary.
• Give helpful criticism when necessary but do so diplomatically. Criticize the
work not the person. It is better to say,“The introduction needs . . . ”rather than
“You left out . . . in your introduction.”
54

Developing Professional Skills
• Share the praise and other rewards for accomplishment even though you are the
most deserving.
• Strive for excellence and be enthusiastic about being on the team.
• Make others feel important.
• Be courteous and show respect but be yourself.
• Let your personality sparkle just enough for others to be glad they had a chance
to work with you.
Team Dynamics
Several factors, however, can affect the success of a team. These factors are called
team dynamics. Team dynamics are unseen influences, relationships, or forces that
operate between different people or groups of people in the team. These forces can
strongly influence how a team reacts, behaves, or performs. You should be aware
of these influences and how they impact the team. Here are only a few of the many
examples of the factors that influenc teams:
• Personality styles—friends; dominant, compliant, introverted, or extraverted
personalities—results in including or excluding people;
• Office layout—barriers that can separate members—results in poor communication;
• Team roles—authority figure, specialist, perfectionist—results in members fear-
ing to speak or a competitive situation might occur;
• Tools and technology—e-mail, texting, hidden ways to communicate—results
in discussion which can exclude other team members;
• Process, methodologies, procedures—not well defined—results in members feeling
they lack direction.
Establish Team Rules
To establish the basis for a successful team is to identify the house rules, also
referred to as the ground rules.The team should suggest and agree on some general
FIGURE 7 • Office professionals working as a team.
55

house rules before the meeting progresses. When these rules are not adhered to,
any team member may point this out and bring the meeting back on track. Sug-
gestions for house rules might be as follows:
• Everyone will be given an equal opportunity to speak.
• Any person wishing to speak must raise his or her hand.
• When someone disagrees, they are to criticize only the issue, not the person with
the issue.
• Team members may not carry on side conversations.
• Each team member must focus on the speaker.
• Team members should expect unfinished business from time to time.
• Each meeting will begin and end on schedule.
• Everyone will focus on the topic and will not interrupt the team’s work for
outside reasons.
• Team members may not display negative body language.
Example
Your department is made up of several cubicles in a large, open area. The arrange-
ment has become crowded and the work flow process has become impractical.You
are on a team that must make a recommendation about the rearrangement of the
cubicles. Joan and Sue are on the team and are best friends; Joe, another team
member is quiet and simply gets his work done and rarely chats with the rest of
the group. Urbania is a perfectionist about everything. You are the team leader.

RECOGNIZE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
To deal effectively with others in the workplace, it is necessary to recognize people
have different capabilities, needs, and interests. These different capabilities, needs,
and interests are referred to as individual differences. The purpose of learning and
understanding about individual differences in personality types is to help you build
a better working relationship or establish rapport with others. Author Andrew J.
Dubrin offers the following suggestions for dealing with different personality types
56

Developing Professional Skills
in Human Relations: Interpersonal Job-Oriented Skills (Pearson Prentice Hall,
2007). These suggestions are restricted to readily observable aspects of personality.
1. When relating to a person who appears to be neurotic based on symptoms of
worry and tension, be laid back and reassuring. Attempt not to project your
own anxiety and fears. Be a good listener. If possible, minimize the emphasis
on deadlines and the dire consequences of a project’s failing. Show concern
and interest in the person’s welfare.
2. When relating to an extraverted individual (one with an outgoing, friendly
personality), emphasize friendliness and warmth and provide a stream of
chatter. Talk about people more than ideas, things, or data. Express an inter-
est in a continuing working relationship. These people can put together cre-
ative ideas and plans.
3. When relating to an introverted individual, move slowly in forming a working
relationship. Do not confuse quietness with lack of interest. Tolerate moments
of silence. Emphasize ideas, things, and data more heavily than people. Intro-
verted people may get upset if you borrow a stapler and forget to return it.
4. When relating to a person who is open to experience,emphasize information shar-
ing, idea generation, and creative approaches to problems. Appeal to his or her
intellect by discussing topics of substance rather than ordinary chatter and gossip.
5. When relating to a person who is closed to experience, stick closely to the facts
of the situation at hand. Recognize the person prefers to think small and deal
with the here and now.
6. When relating to an agreeable person, just relax and be yourself. Reciprocate
with kindness to sustain a potentially excellent working relationship (see
Figure 8).
7. When relating to a disagreeable person, be patient and tolerant. At the same
time, set limits on how much mistreatment you will take. Disagreeable people
sometimes secretly want others to put brakes on their antisocial behavior.
8. When relating to a conscientious person, give him or her freedom and do not
nag. The person will probably honor commitments without prompting. Con-
scientious people are often taken for granted, so remember to acknowledge
the person’s dependability.
FIGURE 8 • To deal effectively with others in the workplace, it is necessary 
to recognize people have different capabilities, needs, and interests.
57

Developing Professional Skills
9. When relating to a person of low conscientiousness, keep close tabs on him or
her, especially if you need the person’s output to do your job. Do not assume
because the person has an honest face and pleasing smile, he or she will deliver
as promised. Frequently follow up on your requests, and impose deadlines if
you have the authority. Express deep appreciation when the person does
follow through.
10. When relating to a person with a high propensity for risk taking and thrill
seeking, emphasize the risky and daring aspects of activities familiar to you.
Talk about a new product introduction in a highly competitive market, the lat-
est technology available, skydiving, bungee jumping, or racecar driving. Risk
takers desire situations that involve thrill seeking.The decisions they make be-
cause of this propensity can affect their performance on the job.
The more you recognize certain personality types and how they are different or
similar to your type personality, the better you will be able to relate to them and
find it easier to work with them in harmony.
Example
You work with Haruka. Haruka is a very detail-oriented person. She is very par-
ticular, neat, and is often referred to as “picky” because she labels everything on
her desk—her stapler, pen, tape dispenser, correction fluid, etc. She is, however, an
excellent worker because she is mindful of details, deadlines, and correctness in her
work. The problem is, she has little patience with others who are not like her. She
gets very upset when someone borrows or even moves something on her desk from
the exact position where she put it. Others in the office have gotten tired of the
way she is and often do things that irritate Haruka on purpose. The situation is
brewing, and you are afraid it has gone too far. If you were the office manager, how
would you handle Haruka and others in the office about Haruka’s “pickiness”?
You really don’t want to lose any employees over this issue.
LEARN TO WORK WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE
No matter how congenial you are, how much a team player you are, how nice and
cooperative you are, you will encounter people with whom it is difficult to inter-
act effectively. While some employees who are difficult to work with perform their
jobs well, other difficult people do not perform well on the job or interfere with
the job performance of others.
Studies show about 10 percent of the workforce falls in the “difficult to work
with” category. Based on your experience, you might say, “No, I believe it is much
more than that!”How do we define a “difficult”person? A person can be difficult to
work with if they have annoying habits, if they are disruptive, if they talk too loud, if
they interrupt, if they complain, if they are lazy, if they. . . . We could go on and on. A
difficult person is one who is difficult to you but may not be difficult to someone else.
Certain types of difficult people, however, have been identified and everyone
agrees about these types. Some are bullies, gossips, gripers, naggers, dictators—the
list could go on. Here are a few common types and some suggestions on how to
cope with them:
The Bully
The bully uses intimidation to gain control by making others angry or afraid. The
bully tries to push all your buttons by yelling, name-calling, sarcasm, mocking,
58

Developing Professional Skills
putting down, belittling, embarrassing, or negativity to cause these reactions
in others.
Characteristics
• I will not move; you will move for me.
• I will sneak up on you, and you won’t know it.
• I will attack when threatened by others.
Coping
• Think only about the positive attributes of the bully—what you like about him
or her when he or she is not bullying.
• Look him or her straight in the eye. Using a calm, normal voice and I instead of
you words,say exactly what you don’t like about his or her behavior.For instance,
“I do not like it when people raise their voice at me. I feel as if I am being treated
as a child. I am not a child. I am an adult and want to be treated as such.”
Gossips
Gossips go from person to person spreading negative rumors about others whether
true or not, trying to set one person against the other. They look for people who
will listen and agree with them. They feel open to use anyone’s name who listens
to them and say such things as “I just talked to Jo and she told me . . . ” It makes
them feel powerful.
Characteristics
• I thrive on news, any kind of news.
• I have many friends and love to extract personal information from them.
• I will lie or stretch the truth, and it will not bother me at all.
Coping
• When the gossiper begins telling his or her rumor, break into the conversation
and say something positive about the person or situation.
• Each time the gossiper resumes interrupt with,“Yes, but . . . ” and give a positive
statement about the person or situation. Gossips dislike talking to people who
always find the good in others or in situations.
• If you refuse to listen, sooner or later the gossips will get the message.
Example
You were walking down the hall to your office and your supervisor meets you and
in a stern voice says, “I need to see you in my office in ten minutes!” You immedi-
ately start to worry and wonder what you have done wrong. Why is the supervi-
sor so angry at you? In ten minutes, you go into your supervisor’s office. You are
anxious, so you don’t sit down. The supervisor says, “Don’t just stand there; sit
down.” Reluctantly you do so. The supervisor says in a pleasant voice,“You did a
really great job on that report, and I want to thank you.” You are astonished but
say,“Thank you.”After a little more visiting, the supervisor says that you may go.
How would this treatment make you feel?
59

Developing Professional Skills
Know-It-All
Know-it-alls believe they are the experts.They have opinions about everything, but
when they are found to be wrong, they pass the buck or become defensive.
Characteristics
• I know I know more than you.
• I believe I am better than you.
• I will tell you anything you want to know.
Coping
• Deal with them on a one-to-one-basis, not in a group setting.
• Check the facts, be sure your facts are correct, and then state your facts.
• Do not put down the know-it-all.
• Give the person a way out so he or she can save face.
Backstabber
Backstabbers will try to get you to discuss a problem or situation in which you are
involved. They appear to befriend you and encourage you to talk freely. Later they
go to the person or supervisor with whom they know they can cause the most dam-
age to you, and they repeat what you told them, often embellishing the informa-
tion. They want to discredit you to others.
Characteristics
• I will be your friend, and then I will talk about you behind your back.
• I will promise I will not repeat a thing you say, but I will repeat all and use
your name.
• I really don’t like you, but I will pretend that I do.
Coping
• Do not retaliate by talking about the backstabber. You may appear to be the
backstabber, not him or her.
• Stay away from the backstabber—as far as you can in all professional matters.
Build alliances with people you know you can trust. When someone mentions
what they heard the backstabber say about you, just say, “Oh, that’s Mr. B. He
Example
You have heard Ishia talking about Rudy several times lately and have ignored it.
You know for a fact that much of what she says isn’t true. Today, however, she is
talking to her and Rudy’s boss negatively about Rudy. Should you keep quiet or
should you speak to the supervisor?
Example
You are so sick of hearing Demetrio tell everyone how skilled he is, how much he
knows, and how successful he is at everything. In your mind, you call him a 
bag of wind. You have to work with Demetrio and you love your job. What can
you do to make your relationship more pleasant with Demetrio?
60

Developing Professional Skills
has never forgiven me for my last promotion. I don’t know what the problem
is. He won’t let me talk to him about it. I just ignore him.”
• Always think before you speak. Don’t say anything to anyone in the office you
wouldn’t want repeated.
• Keep an accurate record of what happens. If the backstabber is your boss, you
need accurate verification of what was said—date, time, conversation, and any-
one else who heard it.
Blamers
Blamers never solve their own problems. When faced with a problem, they think
someone else caused it—the supervisor, a group member, or you.
Characteristics
• I will tell you all about my problems, but I really don’t want any suggestions.
• It is never my fault; it is someone else’s fault.
• I feel sorry for myself because this is happening to me.
Coping
• Attempt to get the blamer to answer the question, “Whose responsibility was it for
(whatever the problem is)?”Answering that question gets to the heart of the problem.
• Remind the blamer he or she must take ownership of his or her actions. Life is
a matter of choices. Who made the choice?
Example
You mentioned to Larry, without thinking about who you were talking to, that you
were thinking about retiring. You really haven’t thought it through seriously, but
have been considering it as a possibility. First thing this morning, you had three
people come by your desk and mention they heard you were retiring. Now you are
worried your supervisor has heard about it. What will you do?
Example
Kim Ahn came to you upset because she had been dating the supervisor, and they
had an argument this morning, and she said he said he would be moved out by the
time she got off work today. She told you all about their problems, their personal re-
lationship, and how unhappy she was with his leaving. You remarked that perhaps
she should go and talk to him. She said no, that she was afraid to because he might
fire her. She said this was all his fault. You make a couple more suggestions, but she
wouldn’t accept those either. The boss walked by and saw you two talking. He had
an angry look on his face. What should you do?
Difficult people tend to bring out the worst in us. Many know how to “push
our buttons” to cause us to react emotionally, to cause us distress, or simply to cre-
ate tension. Here is a plan to follow to help you deal with these difficult situations:
1. Do not react emotionally; stand back and take a look at the situation. If you
do not have to respond immediately, take time to write down everything in as
much detail as possible.
2. Analyze the behavior of the difficult person. Identify exactly what was said
that caused you to feel threatened or upset.What do you believe motivated the
person to make the statement or to create the situation?
61

Developing Professional Skills
3. Analyze your behavior and emotional response (e.g., anger, frustration,
disappointment).
4. Decide exactly what behavior—all or part—you believe you must acknowl-
edge and respond to and why.
5. Define all the ways you might respond.
6. Decide on a plan: What will you say (making sure you form the statements
using I and not you), where will you say it, and when will you say it?
7. Imagine how the person might respond.
The effect these people have on the average person is anger, rapid heartbeat,
rise in blood pressure, and flushed face. What effect do they have on the orga-
nization? When they aren’t dealt with by management, the effects are usually
low morale, increased conflict between employees, decreased productivity,
feeling of intimidation, group demoralization, and ultimately rising costs. One
of the most difficult jobs of a supervisor is dealing with difficult people. The
best way to handle these people is through accurate documentation on their em-
ployee evaluations. As an office professional, if you want to advance into a
higher-level, higher-paying job, most likely it will involve supervision. You
must learn to be objective and put feelings aside and evaluate each employee
fairly based on their performance. Once a difficult person knows his or her
behavior is unacceptable, then a low-performance evaluation may bring about
improvement.
UNDERSTAND CONFLICT RESOLUTION
What is conflict? Conflict is a disagreement where two or more people involved
perceive there is a threat to their needs, interests, or concerns. Conflict is inevitable
in the workplace. As an office professional you will most likely experience situa-
tions where coworkers with different views, goals, or needs get into conflicts, and
it can result in personal animosity.
The fact that conflict occurs, when managed successfully, however, can be a
good thing. Problems can be solved and outcomes can be positive. Positive results
can provide increased understanding, improved self-knowledge, and in a team sit-
uation, group cohesiveness can occur.
Here are some guidelines to follow when dealing with conflict. A facilitator
may be present if agreed upon by each party. Each party should:
• agree to come together voluntarily at a private location;
• agree to work cooperatively on the issues;
• agree what is going to be said will be kept confidential between the two
parties;
• agree on some ground rules, such as allow each party to speak without inter-
ruption (a timer can be used and set for three minutes; one person will talk and
the other must listen without interrupting during that time, and then the situa-
tion is reversed);
• agree to listen to the other person intently, focusing completely on what is be-
ing said without interruption, accusing, finding fault, or name-calling;
• gather information and identify key issues without making accusations about
who said what;
62

Developing Professional Skills
• state his or her position and how it has affected him or her while the second
party listens;
• view the other party’s position by stating the position as he or she understands
it to be, after which the first party may make clarifications; when finished, the
procedure is repeated with the second party;
• agree to what he or she can do to solve the problem through to creating a 
win-win situation;
• draw up an agreement with each getting a copy of what was agreed upon.
Conflict in the workplace can be very destructive when not managed correctly.
To avoid these negative circumstances it is best to take a positive approach and
stress non-confrontational discussion. If this is done, conflict can often be resolved
effectively.
TEACH OTHERS
Often the opportunity will arise on the job for you to help others learn new tech-
niques, processes, software, equipment, or other new skills. Seize every opportu-
nity to volunteer when the need arises to help others learn. Office personnel who
work together and learn from one another create an atmosphere that eliminates
stress, offers solutions in times of crisis, and prevents work bottlenecks when
someone is absent. Here are some helpful hints to successfully teach others:
• Be patient; not everyone learns at the same rate.
• Recognize that some learn by doing rather than just being told.
• Don’t overwhelm the learner; teach in short segments.
• Always review when you begin and summarize when you end a session.
• Don’t view others’ learning as a threat to your job.
Example
Hillary wants to learn Spanish. She had been studying Spanish from a set of CDs she
purchased. You speak Spanish fluently. How can you help her with her Spanish?
OFFER EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE
Exceptional customer service is helping customers, clients, or coworkers with a
willingness to put their needs first to help resolve their problems. Some of these
skills include the following:
• smiling and being friendly;
• offering to help before being asked;
• locating someone who can help if you are unable to;
• letting someone who is upset vent frustration and then showing empathy and
understanding;
• going above and beyond what would normally be expected of you.
These highly desirable skills will promote your professional image and the
customers-first image of the company. Customer service does not mean just offering
excellent service to those customers outside your business; it also means you see each
person within your organization as a customer as well and treat him or her as such.
63

Developing Professional Skills
EXERCISE LEADERSHIP
Exercising leadership means communicating clearly and effectively your position
on certain matters, persuading or convincing others, and responsibly challenging
existing procedures and policies when necessary.A good leader shows self-confidence
and intelligence, follows the rules, stands behind his or her word, is trustworthy,
and has a sense of humor.
It has been said that good leaders are made, not born. If you have the desire
and willpower to become a leader, your chances of attaining that goal will improve
by developing effective leadership skills. Good leaders develop through a never-
ending process of self-study, education, training, and experience. Remember,
power does not make you a good leader; power just means you are the boss. A
good leader influences employees to want to do a good job by leading rather than
just bossing people around.
NEGOTIATE EFFECTIVELY
Negotiation is something we do every day and is not something just used in busi-
ness. Whether you are discussing what TV show to watch, which restaurant you
will eat at, or which car to purchase, you are constantly negotiating. According to
the U.S. Department of Labor, negotiating means exchanging ideas, information,
and opinions with others to work toward agreements to formulate policies and
programs and/or arrive jointly at decisions, conclusions, or solutions. A good
negotiator:
• plans before he or she begins. Do your homework so you will know the other’s
side and then develop a plan and write it down. Allow the other person to state
his or her position without interrupting. Use silence to your advantage. Think
over your response before you begin talking.
• recognizes the other person often asks for more than he or she expects to get.
• practices negotiating skills every opportunity you get. Practicing will make
you stronger and will allow you to discover what you did wrong through trial
and error.
• is ready to compromise. Know the minimum and maximum for which you are
willing to settle. Identify the benefits of your offer. Even getting a little of what
you want makes you a winner.
Example
You work in the payroll department. You enter the data in the computer for the
software program to calculate and print each employee’s paychecks each week.
You noticed there was no overtime on Julie Ramos’ time card, and you saw her
working late at least two days that past pay period as you were leaving late your-
self. Should you bring this to Julie’s attention or just let Julie get it corrected next
pay period?
Example
Horatio, your supervisor, has nominated you for Employee of the Month. What
three characteristics do you you think would warrant recognizing someone for this
award?
64

Developing Professional Skills
• displays excellent people skills. You must observe the other person always
showing respect and be ready to adjust to his or her personality. Try to see the
issue from the other person’s point of view.
• is a good listener. Develop the habit of summarizing what the other person says
to make sure you understand his or her intent.
EMBRACE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM
Constructive criticism is the process of offering one’s opinion about the work of
another. The criticism should involve both positive and constructive comments
and offer the comments in a friendly manner rather than an oppositional one.
Some people tend to take criticism negatively; we should embrace constructive
criticism, even welcome it because it can help us improve. Here are some guide-
lines on how to give constructive criticism and how to accept it:
To give constructive criticism:
1. Be genuine. Criticism is only constructive if the person giving it truly means
to help the person receiving it and feels it is important.
2. Always give criticism in private.
3. Don’t sound threatening. Avoid statements that start with “I think you
should,”or “You have to,”or “You had better.”It would be better to say,“Let’s
take a look at what has been happening and see if, between the two of us, we
can work out a solution. What do you think?”
4. Focus on the problem, not the person.
To receive constructive criticism:
1. Welcome the criticism. See it as a way for you to improve.
2. Listen carefully to the criticism; restate the criticism when necessary.
3. Focus on the problem, not the person giving it.
4. Understand it can help improve the interpersonal relationship between you
and the person giving the criticism.
Example
Roscoe has a history text he purchased new this semester for $110. The bookstore
is offering him $20 to purchase it back. The used ones cost $80. Another student
told Roscoe that Landry is going to take history next semester, and they would still
be using that text. When Roscoe told Landry he had a used history text he would
sell him for $60, Landry said,“You’ll have to do better than that!”and walked off.
What was wrong with this negotiation?
Example
Jose’s supervisor met with him about his annual evaluation. The supervisor began
by pointing out that Jose seemed to finish his work after the deadline quite often,
and the supervisor had scored him low on that point. He also mentioned Jose
should take more initiative about asking for more work when he finished a proj-
ect. He was scored low on that also. What questions could Jose have asked to bet-
ter understand how he could improve in these areas?

Developing Professional Skills
RESPECT DIVERSITY
What is diversity? Diversity refers to the variety of experiences and perspectives
that arise from differences in race, culture, religion, mental or physical abilities,
heritage, age, gender, sexual orientation, and other characteristics. Offices today
are diverse and the trend is to value diversity. Keep these thoughts in mind about
diversity:
• Our workforce is becoming more diverse.
• Employers consider diversity to be sound business practice because it allows
them to better serve a wide range of customers.
• Your employer is bound by state and federal law to ensure that no employee
suffers discrimination and that he or she is allowed to progress to his or her full
potential.
• Diversity is not just cultural diversity, which may or may not be identified by
physical characteristics. It encompasses less visible differences such as religion
and sexual orientation.
• Sensitivity to the differences of others is essential. Learn about these differences
in order to help build good working relationships. You should recognize the
value of differences, combat discrimination, and recognize its rewards in the
workplace. Negative attitudes toward diversity can harm work relationships
and damage morale and productivity.
• People have more similarities than differences. Recognize that we all want good
health, peace, and security for ourselves and our families.
• Respect, tolerance, and goodwill are the keystones to enjoying the rich diversity
of our world.
As an office professional, you must be knowledgeable about diversity in the
workplace and embrace it.
Example
Hannah, Denise, and Roshannae are all different. They are different in race, cul-
ture, and age, yet they are able to get along really well, especially since each de-
pends on the other to do their job. What obstacles do you think they had to
overcome to have the positive relationship they now have?
RECOGNIZE OFFICE POLITICS
Office politics can be defined simply as actions taken by office employees to in-
fluence others for personal reasons. Depending on how you react to office politics,
it can work either to your advantage or your disadvantage.
These attempts to influence others are often exhibited in some of the follow-
ing ways:
• Withholding or Selectively Sharing Information. If an employee chooses to pass
along damaging information, it can seriously affect the careers of other em-
ployees. The same is true when accurate information is withheld.
• Creating Political Networks. When a person cultivates a relationship with
someone for the purpose of getting advancement in the office, gaining informa-
tion, getting approval on a project, or reaching other personal objectives, it is
referred to as political networking. If you are excluded from the office social
network, you may become quite powerless.
66

Developing Professional Skills
• Accusing Other People. Sometimes one employee will repeatedly place blame on
a particular employee. This action might be to target the person who is in a de-
sirable position. Eventually, management may be convinced that the employee
being blamed is detrimental to the staff. In this case, the accused person may
lose his or her job, leaving the job open for the accuser.
• Forming Groups. How often have we heard the expression “strength in num-
bers”? When two or more people with a common purpose join together to force
a change in the office, they are acting politically. This group may attempt to
change office procedures or even to change management decisions.
If you become politically involved in your company for the good of others,
especially your coworkers or subordinates, you will be favorably recognized. On
the other hand, the people who lose at the game of office politics or are the victim
of another person’s political gain will view office politics as unfavorable.
The best policy is to stay away from politics that will adversely affect others.
However, some healthy political maneuvers that bring success to your team and
are not at the expense of others are characteristics of good leadership.
Example
Juanita’s coworkers believe she is trying to be recognized as “special” by the su-
pervisor. She volunteers for extra assignments, brings her coffee when she gets
some for herself, and brings fresh vegetables to her from her garden or when she
finds a great sale at the grocery store. The coworkers think she is trying to take ad-
vantage of every situation to get ahead of everyone so she will get promoted. They
believe Juanita is playing office politics. Is Juanita just being a really nice person
or is she playing office politics in your opinion?

KEEP CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL
Whatever management system you work for, you will always have to practice dis-
cretion when it comes to confidential information.
Refrain from repeating your manager’s opinions. In fact, most activities that
take place in your office should be kept confidential. To gain the trust of your or-
ganization, your manager, and your coworkers, do not discuss, mention, or refer
to company business outside your office.
67

Developing Professional Skills
When there is an upcoming company announcement and you are aware of it,
keep it confidential. Company announcements should come from management.
Be careful not to give away confidential information to your friends and col-
leagues or to your company’s competitors. Sometimes just one isolated fact ob-
tained from you is all the information that a competitor needs. Confidential
information is often given away without intent. When this happens, you never
know where the information will be shared, with whom, and how it will be used.
When it comes to sharing company information, use good judgment and discre-
tion at all times.
COPE WITH CHANGE
People resist change because they want to continue to be in control of what is hap-
pening. They seem to have a natural inclination to do so. But changes do come in
our lives, and they come sooner than we expect them. Changes in the office are
brought about rapidly today because:
• Technology is being continually updated.
• Competition is now increased because companies are competing in a global
marketplace.
• Businesses are restructuring—in other words, making changes within the orga-
nization to meet competition. They are restructuring by combining or eliminat-
ing functions and by downsizing, which means reducing staff by eliminating
jobs and sometimes whole departments and divisions and by outsourcing which
means sending work overseas where labor is cheaper.
• Increased government involvement affects business activities.
Regardless of where you work, you will experience change.Anticipate change and
realize it is a constant.Expect to use new equipment and new software,experience sev-
eral new job assignments, and shift priorities during your career.
Example
You and several other administrative assistants went to a workshop on using var-
ious Web-based systems to enhance communication. At the workshop you saw a
former coworker who had moved to a competitor to accept a higher-level position
that paid more money. She was so glad to see you, and she wanted to catch up on
everything that had happened since she left. You shared everything with her, in-
cluding two new products the company had developed and planned to have a sur-
prise announcement about before the month was over. The next week you were
reading the local industry newsletter you subscribed to and on which your former
coworker was a contributing editor, and read all about the two new products your
company would be announcing. What should you do?
Example
Your company has merged with another company due to a buyout which resulted
in your job being duplicated.The two positions must be addressed meaning all tasks
must be identified and evaluated to determine if one or two people will be needed.
This could mean you would lose your job if only one person was needed.What could
you do to be seen as someone who is valuable and an asset to the company?

COPE WITH STRESS
Stress happens because of our physical and psychological response or reaction to
events, people, and environment. Work can be stressful, yet some people seem to
thrive on stress whereas others crumble under the strain. The difference is that
those who cope with stress best have control of their jobs and themselves. They
are meeting deadlines, but they are setting their own deadlines to the extent that
it is possible to do so and working at their own pace. Furthermore, they have a
positive attitude toward their work.
A person who has a lot of responsibility outside his or her job often suffers
from stress because he or she is trying to do too much—accepting responsibility
for family and home, volunteering for community work, going to school, and try-
ing to satisfy many different demands.
Wellness Programs
Although the workplace may seem to be safe, hazards abound. Egronomic illnesses
such as repetitive stress injuries, neck strain, eye stress, and muscle strain are just
the beginning. The most common workplace illness in the professional environ-
ment is mental stress.
Companies are well aware of the effect of stress on the employee. They are
equally aware of the cost to the company when workers are away from their jobs
either through physical illness or mental stress leaves. It is in the company’s best
interest to take good care of its employees. That is why programs for prevention
of workplace illness are in place in many organizations. Some of the common pro-
grams include
• free access to wellness counselors, social workers, and psychologists;
• company-sponsored memberships in health clubs;
• health seminars held at lunchtime;
• health videos, CDs, and books available in the company library;
• company-paid massage therapy;
• company-sponsored health care and dental plans;
• health food in the company cafeteria;
• fitness programs offered at the company’s own gym or courts.
To cope with stress, analyze what is happening to you. Frequently, it is not the
situation that causes stress but how you react to it and what you do about it. Also,
the longer the duration of the problem, the more likely it is to produce stress. A
certain amount of stress helps us to be alert, efficient, and creative, but it is im-
portant to learn to cope with stress before it becomes too great.

How to Cope with Stress
✓Recognize that anger and frustration are energy wasters. Han-
dle conflicts calmly as they occur rather than letting things
build up. For example, if arriving at work late causes you stress,
can you get up earlier in the morning? Can you decide what to
wear in the evening rather than waiting until the next morning?
Can you ask your children to help prepare their lunch in the
evening or the next morning? By recognizing the event that trig-
gers your stress, learn to take control.
✓Organize your work and your time for the entire day. Prioritize
your tasks. Do not plan more than is possible to do in a day.
✓Analyze an overload of work and discuss it with your supervi-
sor. Offer solutions. You will relieve stress when you face a sit-
uation rather than allow yourself to be overwhelmed by it.
✓Do not be overly critical of your work and yourself; do not ex-
pect too much of others. Strive for excellence, not perfection,
but at times be pleased with an acceptable performance.
✓Slow down! Work at a comfortable pace that will enable you to
keep mistakes to a minimum, to relate well with others, and to
avoid backtracking and revising.
✓Avoid taking on too much. Learn to say no, but say it tactfully.
✓Talk about your stressful problems. Find someone in whom you
can confide—someone away from the company who is an ef-
fective listener.
✓Eat nourishing food regularly and in moderate amounts.
✓Schedule relaxation. During a break on the job, be quiet and
practice relaxing techniques. Allow yourself a quiet hour at
home. Schedule some time for a hobby.
✓Get regular exercise of the right kind for you.
✓Escape to a movie,to your favorite TV program to spend time with
others,or do something for someone in need.Escaping from your
daily problems will give you fresh energy to cope with them.

DISPLAY GOOD MANNERS
Knowing how to entertain a guest and displaying good manners at a business
lunch are desirable social skills for any office professional. Management may ex-
pect you to take a new employee or customer to lunch, you might attend a busi-
ness lunch for an association you belong to, or you might be attending a luncheon
at a conference or business meeting.Whatever the occasion, you will want to make
the right impression.
70

Developing Professional Skills
Entire books have been devoted to the subject of using proper manners. This
short section is not meant to be a detailed guide; rather, the intent here is to help
you avoid making embarrassing mistakes. The following are some simple but im-
portant guidelines for business dining:
1. When escorted by the restaurant host to a table, your guest should walk ahead
of you and behind the host.
2. If you take a guest to a restaurant that has open seating, lead the way to an
appropriate table.
3. Unless you intend to negotiate with your guest during lunch, offer your guest
the best seat at the table; remember, your objective is to make your guest feel
comfortable. Often the best seat is the one facing the main eating area. Never
seat guests so they are facing the exit doors, the kitchen, or restroom doors.
4. Place your napkin on your lap only after everyone has arrived and is seated;
once the meal begins, the napkin should not be placed on the table until the
meal is finished.
5. Guests will get an idea of an acceptable price range from the meal you suggest
or order. Having your guest order first is a courteous gesture, but unless your
guest knows what you plan to eat, you may be placing your guest in an awk-
ward position.
6. When the server takes your order, refer to the other party as your guest 
(“I will let my guest order first,”“My guest would like to order . . . ”or something
similar). This is a clue to the server that you would like the bill brought to you.
7. Let hot food cool naturally; do not blow on your food, stir soup or coffee that
is too hot, or fan your food. These activities are distracting and are considered
rude, unbusinesslike behavior.
8. Begin eating only after everyone has been served. Often meals will arrive at
the table a few minutes apart. It is considered rude to begin eating while some-
one is left sitting without a meal.
9. If you reach for something, such as a condiment or breadbasket, offer the item
to your guest before you serve yourself.
10. Table settings are often confusing and leave a person wondering which glass or
fork to use.The general rule for utensils is outside in. If there is a series of forks
or spoons, simply begin by using the one on the outer edge of your table setting
and work inward toward your plate. Your glass will be at the top of your knife
on the right side of your plate; your bread and butter plate will be to your left.
11. Never chew with your mouth open or talk with food in your mouth. It is wise
to take only small bites so that you can carry on a conversation.
12. If the need arises to remove something undesirable from your mouth (such as
a seed, bone, pit, or partially chewed food), you should use a utensil rather
than your fingers to catch the food. Lift your napkin to your mouth at the
same time to conceal the unwanted food.
13. The proper way to eat any form of bread is to break it off as needed into bite-
sized pieces.
14. When you are finished eating, never remove or stack dishes for the server. You
want to maintain a professional business image.
15. Never primp at the table. If you wish to apply cosmetics, comb your hair,
straighten your clothing or—worst of all—blow your nose,do so in the restroom.
Following these general guidelines will increase your confidence and pleasure at
any business lunch.
71

Developing Professional Skills
Example
You are at a business lunch meeting with your supervisor and several customers.
Business will be discussed after the meal, and you are to take notes. The problem
is this restaurant is a very upscale restaurant. When you sit down, you notice there
are not only utensils to the left and right of your plate, but there are also utensils
above your plate, and there are several extra glasses and a small bowl with water
and half a lemon tied attractively with a cloth and ribbon. What should you do?
Displaying Ethical Behavior
Every office professional must display ethical behavior to be viewed as a profes-
sional. Ethical behavior is behavior that conforms to accepted professional stan-
dards of conduct. Ethics are a system of deciding what is right, or more right, in a
given situation. Ethics involve your values and what you believe to be the right
way you should live your life; therefore, you behave in ways that display these
values.
Many questionable employee practices are common in the workplace. Here
are some examples of situations of questionable behavior:
• doing something unethical based on a request by your manager—for example,
shredding documents;
• altering information on documents;
• not reporting incidents, such as accidents in a manufacturing company.
Without rules, good ethical practice becomes ambiguous. Codes of ethical
practice are an increasingly popular tool for reducing that ambiguity. Codes of
ethics can be effective depending on whether the organization supports them and
how employees are treated when they break the code. In the end, as an employee
you have the responsibility to do the right thing based upon your own judgment
and personal principles.Additional information about ethical behavior will be dis-
cussed throughout the text.

International Human Relations
If you should decide to work in an office in a country outside the United States,
you have several things to consider. Among the questions you might ask yourself
are the following:
• What general traits are expected of an overseas worker?
You must be ready and willing to change, possess a sense of adventure, have a
desire to be challenged, be open-minded, be patient, and, above all, be flexible.
72

Developing Professional Skills
• What type of adaptation and coping skills must I possess?
You must be emotionally stable, be able to cope with stress, be prepared for cul-
ture shock, have a sense of humor, and be observant and willing to make ad-
justments when needed.
• What intercultural communication skills must I possess?
You must have tolerance, sensitivity, good listening skills, and good nonverbal
skills, and you should possess a second language.
• What traits and skills must I possess personally to be effective in an office?
You must be independent, self-reliant, resourceful, persistent, versatile, organ-
ized, loyal, and energetic. You must possess leadership skills, good verbal com-
munication skills, and a commitment to working overseas.
• What skills will enable me to understand and appreciate different social and po-
litical cultures?
Take the time to read articles on what is happening socially and politically in
the country in which you are interested. Research the Internet to learn about the
leaders, political parties in power, famous musicians, movie stars, and sports fig-
ures. Identify common customs for greetings, gift giving, and meetings. Locate
the nearest U.S. consulate office to obtain current information for U.S. workers.
Professional and technical expertise alone is not enough when working over-
seas. You must embrace the characteristics listed previously to deal with problems
of global survival. You could see many things you aren’t used to, such as poverty,
war, and ecological destruction. You must rely on your inner strength to continue
to develop those human relations skills necessary to be successful when working
in an international environment.

1. Keeping information confidential. You are an ad-
ministrative assistant in the purchasing department.
Another administrative assistant, Joan Lopez, is
getting married in three weeks. The purchasing de-
partment employs twelve office workers, two of
whom are administrative assistants. According to a
rumor, Joan is not coming back to work after the
wedding, and two of the office workers want to ap-
ply for the position. They have come to you to find
out if the rumor is true. You have not seen an official
announcement about Joan’s employment plans after
she gets married. However, Joan did tell you that she
does not plan to come back to work after the wed-
ding. What should you say to your two coworkers?
2. Working in teams. You wanted to take your vaca-
tion during the last week in November, but you did
not request it because Robert Lawson, who fills in for
you when you are absent, had already requested va-
cation during the same week. Yesterday Robert can-
celed his vacation for November because his personal
plans fell through.The vacation schedule is approved
six months in advance, but you still would like to
take vacation during the last week of November. To-
day is November 15.Your team is working on a huge
project that must be completed by November 30.
Someone would have to finish your part of the proj-
ect and the staff is short. Are you justified in making
this request now? Explain why you think you are or
are not justified in making this request.
3. Working with a difficult coworker. You work with
Dillan. Dillan is difficult to work with because of his
negative attitude toward everything—his personal
life, his relationships, his job, and his supervisor.
Dillan rarely makes a positive statement about any-
thing or anyone. You are beginning to have negative
feelings, too. You like your work and your supervisor,
and you can see there will be opportunities for ad-
vancement in this position.Analyze the situation.Your
objective is to overcome your negative feelings toward
Dillan. Outline a specific plan for working with Dillan
using the following steps to resolve the problem. Key
each step followed by your response.
a. Gather all the information about the problem.
b. Determine what you know about the problem
already that might be helpful in forming a solution.
c. Determine if more information is needed and
where to get it.
d. Outline all possible solutions without regard to
cost or practicality at this point.
e. Analyze each solution, discarding those you
know are unworkable and narrow your choices
to two or three solutions.
f. Identify the pros and cons for each solution.
g. Select the best solution among the choices.
4. Discrimination. You have been selected to serve on
the interview committee to narrow the list of appli-
cants down to five for the vacant office manager po-
sition. You and your committee members have
reviewed twenty applicant files. During the discus-
sion to select the five finalists to be interviewed fur-
ther, Aida, one of the committee members, made the
comment that even though older applicants often
have lots of experience, they are usually difficult to
work with and have their way of doing things, not
to mention that they might not be with the com-
pany very long because of their age. Aida suggested
the committee might discuss an age limit for the ap-
plicants to help eliminate the ones everyone thought
would fall in this category. Everyone laughed but
you. No one took Aida seriously; therefore, the sub-
ject was dropped. What harm does a comment such
as this do? Discuss what you think the committee
should have done about this comment, if anything.

Rule 3: Commas Used with a Series
When listing a series of words, phrases, or clauses, set
them off with commas.
By midnight, almost everyone had left the office
party, leaving only the hosts, Maria, and Jessica.
It is critical to retain the comma between the last
two items in this example to prevent any possible
misunderstanding. The way this sentence is worded, it
reads only the hosts and Maria were left at the party.
Without the last comma, it reads that Maria and Jessica
were the hosts.
Rule 4: Commas Used Between Adjectives
When a series of adjectives have the same worth and refer
to the same noun, they should be separated with commas.
If the word and can be substituted and be grammatically
correct, a comma is required.
They are bright, young, attractive lawyers. (Bright,
young, and attractive are adjectives of equal value.)
Compare this example to the next one.
The red modern building is the second to be recog-
nized for its structure. (Red and modern are not of
equal value.)
Rule 5: Commas Used with Introductory 
and Parenthetic Phrases
Place commas after introductory words, phrases, and
clauses of four words or more. If the introductory mate-
rial is fewer than four words, the comma is optional.
Commas are almost always placed after long introduc-
tory elements and those containing verb forms.
As the earthquake intensified, the employees gath-
ered around the radio.
Today[,] the townspeople gathered to assess the
damage. (It is optional to use a comma after Today.)
Parenthetical and defining words and phrases are set
off in commas unless they have a close relation to the rest
of the sentence.
They can, I believe, meet the deadlines.
They were definitely the best presenters for the new
products.

Preparing for Your Employment
V
ery few office support positions are protected from corporate restructuring
and layoffs. Therefore, it is important to be sure you are employable and
know how to plan an effective job campaign.
Search for a position that matches your qualifications, personality, and inter-
ests.Your administrative career should be rewarding both monetarily and in terms
of job satisfaction and opportunities for promotion.
The first part of your job search should be your decision about where you
want to work—the geographic area and the type of business. Unless you have spe-
cialized in the legal or medical field, do not limit yourself to seeking a position in
a specific department, such as marketing, human resources, accounting, or sales.
Remain open to opportunities; often, getting your foot in the door is the first step
to gaining experience and eventually getting the position you really want.
Your office technology skills are transferable. Often the same basic skills are re-
quired in different departments; therefore, never limit your opportunities by ex-
pressing interest in working only for one department. Instead, express interest in
working for the organization. Let the interviewer know you are flexible and will-
ing to adjust to the needs of the position. The interviewer will strive to match you
to a position that will meet the needs of the company and maximize your talents.
Start your job campaign several months before graduation or keep alert to any
reorganization plans in your company. As soon as you decide where you want to
work, make a job prospect list, using the sources listed in this chapter. Next, pre-
pare your self-appraisal inventory and your resume, write your cover letter, and
make a list of the qualifications you plan to emphasize during job interviews. After
you launch your campaign, keep searching until you find the right position for you.
Locating Job Prospects
Some of the sources for prospects are the Internet, the college career office, the yel-
low pages, private and public employment agencies, government service an-
nouncements, chambers of commerce, newspapers, and your network of friends
and associates.
Use all of these sources, not just one, to locate job leads. Once you begin your
campaign, continue the process. Be persistent in checking up and following
through on what is available for someone with your qualifications and interests.
NETWORKING
In planning an approach to meeting and connecting with others for mutual bene-
fit, consider networking. Put in simple terms, networking means exchanging infor-
mation. The more information you give, the more information you usually get
back. If you have information and are willing to share it, you will be viewed as a
valuable person to have on staff.
During the job hunt, networking is an essential step toward gaining successful
employment. Sharing employment information with a network of people is prob-
ably one of the most effective methods of obtaining employment.
• You can begin to build your network by discussing your employment goal with
your instructors and with businesspeople among your friends and family. Keep
in touch with these people as you move through your course work; they may
provide employment opportunities.
88

Preparing for Your Employment
• Attend functions such as job/career fairs, where you can meet prospective
employers. Attend and participate in seminars and other functions where office
administrators and assistants will be present. By expressing your keen desire for
employment and by leaving a positive impression, you will be increasing your
opportunity to learn about possible employment opportunities.
When your contacts give you job leads, follow through on them. Then let the
person who told you about the lead know the results. This is a simple courtesy and
a way of thanking the person for his or her assistance.
To be a good networker, you must be a good listener. By applying your best lis-
tening skills you will collect accurate information. This, in the long run, may save
you time and effort in your job search. By listening to the needs of other net-
workers, you will be able to offer them greater assistance. In this way, you will be
viewed as a valuable network partner. As previously stated, the more information
you provide others, the more people will reciprocate.
Networking is a developed skill that will help enhance your life and your
career. It will increase your ability to be employed and to advance in your career.
The following are suggestions for improving your networking skills:
• If you are employed or have recently been employed, choose a corporate mentor.
A corporate mentor usually holds a position at a higher level than yours. This
person can offer you information and advice about the organization and give
you career direction.
• Never limit your contacts by missing an opportunity to meet new people. Your
network may include business associates, friends, neighbors, past graduates from
your college, relatives, and many other groups of people. A network should be-
come a vast chain of information. The more effort you put into networking, the
more the network will expand, and the greater your chances of career success.
• Make yourself visible. Becoming a leader of a professional organization or
volunteering to serve on a committee will open networking doors.
• Purchase a telephone message machine or sign up for a voice mail plan.
Missed messages may mean lost contacts.
• Increase your reading of business materials. Remember that information is
power and reading will build your information base.
• Develop an organized database of your contacts. A computer database will
be invaluable as the number of contacts expands.You will want to keep a cur-
rent record of names; addresses; telephone and fax numbers and e-mail
addresses; places of employment; job titles; and personal information that
will assist your communications with your contacts.
• Be a giver and not just a taker. Business organizations attempt to hire candi-
dates with a reputation for being contributors to the team, not people who
are self-serving. Therefore, don’t provide information to your network con-
tacts only because you think you will get some in return.
ELECTRONIC SOCIAL NETWORKS
If you are a user of Internet postings, including blogs, as well as social networking
sites, be aware that as applicants and potential employees, your postings are likely
to be read by future employers. So when you put something about yourself out
there, consider your visibility and how it might be viewed by potential employers.
89

Preparing for Your Employment
Be yourself in your postings and at the same time consider ways that will help to
build your credibility. What you post now can be revisited in the next year, two,
or three by your employer when you are being considered for a promotion.
CAMPUS CAREER CENTERS
Most colleges maintain a career office to assist their students in making contacts
for jobs. At the beginning of your job campaign, register with the career office.
Complete the information required, placing your name on the active file with
the center.
The center staff keeps up to date on employment opportunities. They arrange
for company representatives to conduct interviews on campus and to offer job
fairs. The center maintains a list of job openings prepared from the requests of
companies, searching for prospective employees.
Watch for the announcement of forthcoming campus interviews; call the cen-
ter to schedule interviews if needed. Be sure to prepare for the interview and to
keep the appointment.The campus interview is discussed later in this chapter.Your
career advisor will be able to help direct you in locating the most recent informa-
tion regarding your career search, industry profiles, and a directory of employers
interested in hiring college graduates.
Get acquainted with the center staff. Schedule an appointment to talk about
your specific interests, to ask questions, and to seek guidance. Whether your job
hunt is simple or difficult, you will need all the contacts you can get.
JOB FAIRS
Job fairs, sometimes called career fairs, are held on college campuses for entry-level
positions or internships, in hotels and auditoriums for others who are seeking a
position, and online. Their purpose is to attract your attention and “sell” you on
the companies as potential employers. Most fairs are offered free of charge to job
seekers; however, in some cases, where career sessions, such as setting goals and
time management, are held, a small fee may be required.
Job fairs provide excellent opportunities for you to network with other people
who may be interested in finding a new or different position or exploring options
in other areas. Fairs at your campus career centers are open to current students,
alumni, and anyone in the community. Many of the companies that participate in
job fairs are interested in visiting with you as they probably have job openings or
anticipate job openings in the near future.
BUSINESS NEWS ITEMS
Read the business news in the newspaper in the area where you plan to seek em-
ployment for at least a month before you apply for a job. Search for news about
established companies that are relocating their offices to your area or opening a
branch; established businesses that are moving their offices to new buildings or ex-
panding at their present sites; newly formed companies; and companies that are
merging. Any changes within companies may indicate career opportunities.
When you find a news item of interest to you, clip it and save it. It should pro-
vide you with the complete name, type of business, location, and possibly the
opening date of a new office.
The number of office professionals who move to another city when a company
relocates is small compared to the number of executives who transfer to the new
90

Preparing for Your Employment
location. Therefore, you can expect that any organization that has relocated its
offices to another city will be hiring office staff.
A local organization often adds new personnel when it moves its offices to a
new location. Such a move often happens because more space is needed to conduct
current operations and the company cannot add personnel until it can provide
space for them. A company that is expanding its operations often needs additional
office personnel. A new organization will need someone in the office as soon as it
opens and will add personnel to keep pace with the organization’s growth.
DIRECT APPLICATION
Often, the best jobs are not advertised. Many organizations prefer to select their
employees from applicants who take the initiative to come to them seeking
employment. Do not wait for a job to come to you; it probably will not. Take the
initiative to search for a position. Decide where you want to work, and apply. Call
the organization and arrange for an appointment with the person in charge of
hiring office staff.
Be optimistic. Some of the organizations on your prospective list may not be
seeking administrative assistants at this time, but an impressive contact may put
you in line for a future opportunity. If an opening for the position you are seeking
does not exist, ask the human resources representative to place your resume on file.
If you decide to work in a particular business but do not have a specific com-
pany in mind, refer to the yellow pages, which provide local business listings. For
example, if you are interested in working for an advertising company, look up
advertising; there you will find the names and addresses of the local advertising
companies.
STAFFING SERVICES
Openings for positions as office workers are listed with both public and private
employment agencies. The state-supported employment offices and the United
States Employment Service list openings for all kinds of work—industrial, com-
mercial, and professional. The services are free to the job seeker and the employer.
However, the number of jobs listed with a public employment office sometimes is
not representative of the openings in the community.
State employment offices generally give a proficiency test in keyboarding and
frequently a spelling and vocabulary test to office support applicants. To register
with a state employment office,go to the office and fill out an application form.Most
likely you will be able to take the tests and be interviewed during your initial trip to
the office. If an opening is listed for someone with your skills and work experience,
you will be sent to the prospective employer for an interview. After you have regis-
tered with a state employment office, check regularly to find out about openings.
Many private staffing agencies do not charge the applicant a fee for their ser-
vice. In a number of circumstances, however, the prospective employer pays these
fees. You can ask private staffing agencies, such as OfficeTeam (www.officeteam
.com) and Manpower (www.manpower.com), about the services they offer with-
out being obligated to sign a contract. If you do register with a private staffing
agency, study the contract thoroughly and ask questions before you sign.
Most private staffing agencies give excellent service. They administer tests,
advise applicants on their appearance, conduct thorough interviews, and carry out
a complete job hunt for each applicant. A staffing agency charges a company a
placement fee only if the applicant accepts a job obtained through the agency’s
91

Preparing for Your Employment
effort. Therefore, private staffing agencies make a real effort to refer applicants to
jobs for which they are qualified and which they are likely to accept.
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
If you are interested in securing employment with the federal government or in trans-
ferring from one federal job to another, you will find many, many opportunities.
Visit or call the Federal Employment Information Center (FEIC) in the area
you are seeking employment. Also check the Web site (www.usajobs.opm.gov) for
updated job vacancy listings. Request the following information:
• announcements of specific types of jobs;
• a list of local government agencies;
• application forms.
In contacting regional and local agency personnel offices, take the following
steps:
1. Request agency career opportunities brochures.
2. Talk with the agency human resources office and request job announcements
and information on special hiring programs.
3. Obtain local government field office phone numbers from your telephone
directory. Look under “U.S. Government,” generally found in the blue pages.
Visit your local library and review this publication:
The Federal Career Directory. If your library doesn’t have this publication, check
with a local college placement office. This directory provides an agency descrip-
tion and lists typical entry-level positions, agency contacts, student employment
programs, and so on.
4. Visit the Web site for the Occupational Outlook Quarterly. This Web site,
published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, is a
highly informational quarterly publication that highlights employment trends
and features interesting career articles.
Tests are required for specific groups, including office professional workers and
for certain entry-level jobs. The majority, approximately 80 percent, of government
jobs are filled through a competitive examination of your background, work expe-
rience, and education, not through a written test.
NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS
The career sections and help-wanted columns of newspapers are valuable sources
for job openings. The jobs will be listed under a variety of headings, such as
administrative assistant, office assistant, administrative secretary, executive assis-
tant, and information specialist.
• By studying career sections and help-wanted ads, you will gain valuable infor-
mation about trends in employment opportunities, salary ranges, and qualifica-
tions required. Study the ads in newspapers early in your job campaign.
• When you answer a help-wanted ad, be prompt. Reply the same day, if possible,
or at least by the next day. Remember that newspapers are widely read and that
looking in them for available jobs requires less effort than other search techniques.
It follows that the competition will be very high for jobs posted in newspapers.

Office Support Help Wanted
FIGURE 1 • Sample newspaper ads.
• Follow instructions. If a telephone number is given, call for an appointment.
If a post office box number is given, submit your resume. Many advertise-
ments request that applicants submit resumes by mail, fax, or e-mail and
clearly state they do not want applicants to call. If this is the case, follow the
instructions. You risk irritating the employer if you ignore the request for no
telephone calls. Of course, it’s always more proactive and shows a sense of ini-
tiative to telephone the employer and to drop off your resume in person. These
techniques should be part of your strategy unless the employer has requested
otherwise.
• Always study the advertisement carefully to determine all the stated qualifications
and then submit a cover letter and resume showing that you meet all the qualifi-
cations for the job. Follow the suggestions for writing a solicited cover letter dis-
cussed in the section on cover letters later in this chapter. See Figure 1 for sample
newspaper ads.
Blind Advertisements
A blind advertisement is an anonymous listing of a post office box number or a
telephone number but not a company name; it is used to avoid having to interview
a large number of unqualified applicants. For example, say the local National

Hockey League team requires an administrative assistant. If the team advertises its
name in the newspaper, it will receive a flood of applicants, many of whom are un-
qualified but apply because of their desire to work for celebrities. A simple adver-
tisement that lists the responsibilities of the position, the desired qualifications,
and a post office box number is more likely to attract those who are legitimately
interested in performing the advertised responsibilities.
Scrutinize blind advertisements carefully. Sometimes they are used for pur-
poses other than recruitment for employment, such as preparing a mailing list of
prospective purchasers. If you receive a telephone call in response to a reply to a
blind advertisement, ask for the name of the company and ask some questions
about the job during the telephone conversation to be sure the job advertised is
legitimate.
PROSPECTS IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS
To begin your search for job opportunities in other geographic areas, do the
following:
1. Conduct research on the Web by entering “www.companyname.com.”Examples
are www.microsoft.com or www.jcpenney.com.
2. Inquire at the local public library for the telephone directory and the news-
papers for the city in which you are seeking employment.
3. Write, e-mail, or fax the chamber of commerce in the desired geographic area.
4. Visit the campus career center. Ask a staff member to help you identify
prospects in the city where you will be relocating.
The telephone directory for the city where you want to relocate will be an
excellent source of information. Many telephone directories can be found online;
however, you may have to subscribe to those directories. Your public library has
telephone directories for a number of cities, and large public libraries have tele-
phone directories from all the major U.S. cities. Public libraries have the directo-
ries either in paper version or online. Public libraries also subscribe to many
newspapers from other cities.
To find what your public library has on file that will be helpful to you, call the
library and ask for Information Service. The librarian can answer your specific
questions concerning what telephone directories and newspapers are available.
You may be able to obtain the addresses of a few companies from the librarian by
telephone.

Preparing for Your Employment
Ethical Issues in the Job Search
As you know, many businesses adopt a formal document called the code of ethics
that states the primary values and ethical rules they expect employees to follow.
Naturally, they expect employees to hold similar values in terms of their job search
as they would exhibit in the workplace.
Suppose you read an employment ad and you believe you have all the qualifi-
cations advertised. However, the ad mentions the need for specific experience. Al-
though you do not have experience in the area mentioned in the ad, you feel you
can do the job.After all, you believe you are a quick learner.The action you choose
will determine your success. Based on your values and beliefs, study the following
options:
• Option 1. Move to the next employment ad. Because you don’t have the re-
quired experience, you don’t qualify for the position.
• Option 2. Create false experiences and apply for the position. You can just
make something up. After all, the last company you worked for isn’t in business
anymore.
• Option 3. Take a chance and apply for the position. In the interview process,
you can emphasize you have related skills and share how you can apply those
skills to the position.
Let’s consider the options above. In the first option, you may be missing a great
opportunity. Although you lack the specified experience, you may have related
skills. Be prepared to assess your skills and share how you can apply related skills
to the experience needed. You can proceed as Option 3 shows. The worst that can
happen is that your resume would be rejected. The best that can happen is the
prospective employer will see your potential and decide experience is not as im-
portant as initiative.
In Option 2, you are the loser. Adding false or misrepresenting information is
never a good idea. Misrepresentation of information has a way of “snowballing.”
If you are hired and cannot perform the duties that your resume indicated you
could, you will lose the respect of your manager and coworkers—and possibly
your job.

Preparing for Your Employment
Preparing Employment Documents
The resume, cover letter, and job interview are the applicant’s direct contacts with
prospective employers. The following discussion will provide you with methods of
making all three more persuasive and effective.
RESUMES
A resume is a tool that you use to sell yourself to the right employer. It is a reflec-
tion of who you are. It is not a document that rambles on about your qualifica-
tions and experience.A resume is a summary of an applicant’s employment history
and educational background. It must be
• well written;
• well presented; and
• well organized.
An excellent resume can be your passport to success.
A Resume
Sometimes called a curriculum vitae, or CV, a resume is a summary of an appli-
cant’s qualifications for the position being sought. Your resume should answer the
following key questions:
• who you are;
• what type of job you are seeking;
• what qualifications you offer;
• what experience you offer.
Using Resume Software
Resume software companies advertise their products in magazines and in com-
puter stores and on the Web. If you access the Web and enter key search words
such as “resume software” or “resume maker,” you will find several resume prod-
ucts. Most of these software products are designed to
• guide you through the entire writing process from beginning to end, providing
tips, examples, and action words;
• format your information into a professional resume style;
• provide help in writing cover letter and follow-up communications, such as
thank-you and acceptance letters;
• submit your resume to major career Web sites in a clear and readable format,
rather than garbled or in an e-mail attachment that can’t be opened.
You may want to practice using one of the software programs. If so, be certain
that your finished documents are grammatically correct and free of errors in
spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. In lieu of using a resume software pro-
gram, you can learn how to write an effective resume in the following paragraphs.

All resumes should be personalized; however, a few formats offer an attractive and
easy-to-read document for potential employers. The style and benefits of these
resumes follow.
96

Preparing for Your Employment
Chronological Resume.
The chronological resume format arranges your work
experience and education so the most recent information is presented first. The
chronological resume has many advantages: It is the preferred resume for em-
ployers because it is easy to follow and shows exactly what the applicant has done,
not what the applicant thinks he or she can do. This format is especially important
when the applicant has an impressive work or educational history. This format
works well for recent graduates because it emphasizes their education and also
identifies previous work experience responsibilities that relate to the position be-
ing sought. It is featured in Figure 2.
Functional Resume.
The functional resume is designed to point to the applicant’s
skills, abilities, and accomplishments. Refer to Figure 3. If you have never been em-
ployed, the functional resume works well. A functional resume gives you an op-
portunity to emphasize leadership and organizational experience indicating that
you will be a productive employee. A person who has not been employed but has
acquired comparable work experience through volunteering and day-to-day living
can also prepare a functional resume. In this style of resume, the experience sec-
tion is organized by functions, without reference to the time of the performance or
to a specific organization.
Targeted Resume.
The targeted resume format focuses on the applicant’s
achievements and abilities that relate only to a specific position. The disadvantage
of this style is applicants need new resumes for every job application.
Purpose of a Resume
The purpose of a resume is intended to obtain an interview. It should be
mailed, e-mailed, faxed, or personally delivered with a one-page cover letter.
As soon as your resume opens the door for a job interview, it has served its pur-
pose. Whether you are offered the position will depend on your qualifications
and how well you project your knowledge, abilities, and personality during the
interview.
Office professionals, including administrative assistants, executive assistants,
and office assistants, with excellent skills in interpersonal communication, as well
as written communications; organization and planning; and software applica-
tions, such as word processing, spreadsheets, and databases, are in demand. An at-
tractive, informative, and accurate resume that accents these skills will be partially
responsibility for getting the position you desire.
Self-Appraisal Inventory
As a preliminary step to preparing a resume, decide exactly what your qualifi-
cations are. Prepare a detailed self-appraisal inventory, which provides infor-
mation about your educational background, work experience, and personal
qualities and interests so you will know exactly what assets you have to offer
an employer.
To prepare your inventory chart, record all the data you think might help you
in your job search. Use separate sheets of paper to list your education, skills, work
history, and personal qualities. Include everything as you make your list; record
items in any order and rearrange them later, deleting any that may not be relevant
to the work you seek.
Under Skills, list the highlights of your abilities that are the most essential for
the specific job for which you are applying.

99

Preparing for Your Employment
Under Work History, list all your jobs, including part-time, summer, and vol-
unteer work. Be sure to include work experience that was unrelated to office work.
For each job, give the name and address of the organization, your job title, the
details of your duties, the dates of your employment, and accomplishments.
Under Personal Qualities, list your strengths, such as initiative, leadership,
ability to organize, and willingness to learn and participate in a team. Discuss these
qualities when you write your cover letter.
Under Interests, list your hobbies and special talents and the ways you spend
your leisure time.
Points of Emphasis
Organize your resume so the interviewer will grasp your most important qualifi-
cations if he or she reads only the first line of each section of your resume. Prepare
a one-page resume, or put the most essential data on the first page. Here are tips
to follow:
• Many employment consultants emphasize preparing a brief resume. Although
some advocate a one-page resume, this is rarely enough space to include the crit-
ical facts.As your experience and education expand, so must your resume. Most
applicants for office administrative work should have resumes no longer than
two pages.
• Indicate the type of position you are seeking in the Objective section.
• Decide whether your work experience or your education will be most persua-
sive and then place that section immediately after the Objective section.
• To highlight your education, list your most recent experience first. It is often
helpful to list key courses that relate to the employment opportunity. For the
office professional, this often means software or skills-oriented courses.
• Be consistent; just as you listed your education, arrange your work experience
by listing the most recent employment first, followed by other employment.
Suggested Outline for a Chronological Resume
The resumes of two applicants should not be identical, but effective resumes tend
to follow a recognizable pattern. Plan your resume so it presents all your qualifi-
cations and highlights your strongest points.
A resume is a list; it is not necessary to write complete sentences. Use lists
to describe duties or skills, but remember to be consistent. A common error in
resumes is the use of inconsistent verbs. Following is an example of an incon-
sistent list.
Unparallel Construction of Items
Responsibilities
• Keying documents
• Manage electronic databases
• Plan meetings and conferences
Following is an example of a consistent list.
Responsibilities
• Keying documents
• Managing databases
• Planning meetings and conferences
100

Preparing for Your Employment
Avoid using I. A resume contains facts only. Statements that reveal philosophy
or opinion may be used in the cover letter but not in the resume.
Heading.
In the heading, include your name, address, telephone number, fax
number, and e-mail address. If you have a temporary address, provide a permanent
mailing address to ensure that you receive any documentation sent to you. Use a
telephone number with an answering system so you will not miss any important
calls from potential employers.
Objective or Goal.
This section may be referred to as either Objective or Goal.
State the type of position you are seeking and the name of the company with which
you are seeking employment. Write the full name of the organization. Using the
name of the company in the resume shows that the resume was specially prepared.
Here is an example of an effective objective:
To work as an administrative assistant with Cabott Industries.
Some authorities agree that the strongest points may be summarized under a
category called Skills Summary. For example,
Efficient administrative assistant with four years’ experience. Proven ability to
train and direct staff. Successful record in management of three 6-month proj-
ects, development of training programs, and installation of records management
program. Problem solver with interpersonal skills.
Education.
The following information should be included in this section:
1. List the name of each post-secondary institute and high school attended. Place
the most recent college first. If you are still attending college, write,“Expected
Graduation Date: May 15, 200X.”
2. For each entry, indicate your major area of study, stating the degree or cer-
tificate obtained.
3. List your skills.For instance,if you are bilingual,indicate “Proficient in Spanish.”
Include those skills that are applicable and impressive, such as “effective cus-
tomer service skills” or “excellent telephone skills.”
4. List the different types of software you have experience using.
5. List courses you took you believe will be helpful to you on the job. List them
by name, not number.
6. Add school activities that reflect organizational, leadership, and team skills.
Experience.
Beginning with your most recent position, list your employment experi-
ence. If your work experience has been limited, include part-time, summer, and volun-
teer work,even when the work was unrelated to office work.Employers place value on
experience that is common to all jobs, such as carrying out instructions, being prompt
and dependable, working cooperatively with others, and accepting responsibility.
Use a separate entry for each job, and list your current or most recent posi-
tion first. Give the beginning and ending dates (months and years), the name of
the employer, the city in which the organization is located, the position held, the
specific duties performed, and accomplishments. If the job was part time or vol-
untary, place this information under the date. To indicate that you are currently
working, leave the date blank following the hyphen after the beginning date.
Interests and Activities.
Because the human rights codes relating to equal op-
portunity employment make it illegal for an employer to discriminate on the basis
of age, gender, race, marital status, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation,
you are not required to include personal data. However, where you believe certain
personal data may be to your benefit, you should include them.
101

Preparing for Your Employment
In this section, you may add whatever you believe will support your applica-
tion, such as honors received, extracurricular activities, and professional associa-
tions to which you belong.
References. The question of whether to include references is often raised.
Employers know applicants list as references those persons who will provide fa-
vorable recommendations. Many employers check with the persons who are
listed as references; some do not.
Some resumes say, “References available upon request.” Others go ahead and
include the references. If you choose to include references, give two or more for-
mer employers or instructors who can provide a specific evaluation of your com-
petence, work habits, and attitude toward work. If you include a character
reference, do not give the name of a relative. Prior to using the references on your
resume, ask permission of each person you want to include.
For each reference, give the full name, position held, and complete address,
including the postal code. Also include telephone and fax numbers and e-mail ad-
dresses. Use a courtesy title before each name. The position held is significant be-
cause it will indicate the person’s association with you. The person you want to
use as a reference may now be retired or may have moved to a different company.
If that person’s former title is important to your resume, write, for example,
Mrs. Christine Santiago
(Former) Director of Marketing
Or
Mrs. Christine Santiago
(Retired) Director of Marketing
When you succeed in getting a position, send your references a thank-you message
expressing your appreciation for their assistance. Thank-you letters are discussed
in more detail later in this chapter.
Appearance of the Resume
Remember the resume is a specimen of your work. Use appropriate word pro-
cessing or desktop publishing software features so your resume will be a higher-
quality document.
• Print the resume with a laser printer on bond paper, measuring 81⁄2 × 11 inches.
Some authorities suggest soft gray or ecru colors.
• Give the resume plenty of white space, using one-inch margins. The size of the
margins will actually depend on the setup and on the usual requirement to fit
the resume on two pages. To avoid a crowded look, use ample white space be-
fore and after headings and between entries. Too much white space, however,
will suggest inefficient planning.
• Print the main heading at the top of the first page. It should be centered and high-
lighted in such a way that it is eye-catching and easy to read. Suggestions would be
to use bold, enlarged, or italic print. Boxes or lines used in this area will enhance
the appearance.Remember to apply the “be conservative”rule.Using too many en-
hancements will detract from the qualifications your resume is intended to present.
• Side headings should be emphasized but should not detract from the main titles.
To this end, use a combination of capital letters, underlining, and bold or italic
print. However, be moderate; you do not want to reduce the importance of the
main heading.
• The second page will require a heading. Place your name and the page number
at the left margin.
102

Preparing for Your Employment
You must get your resume noticed in the stack that will be received by the
recruiter. An HR staff member sorts the resumes that do not meet the job require-
ments or qualifications. These unqualified resumes will never reach the desk of the
recruiter or department head. Follow these simple rules to be sure your resume is
not filtered out:
• Clearly state your skills that meet the key requirements of the job.
• Follow the instructions. Give precisely what is requested. If the ad states that the
company wishes to have resumes dropped off in person, then drop your resume
off in person.
• Concentrate on every detail. An office professional will catch the smallest er-
ror when scrutinizing the resumes. Any typographical or spelling error may
mean immediate rejection. No employer wants to interview an applicant for
an office professional’s position who allows errors in a document as impor-
tant as a resume. For that reason, don’t rely only on spell checking your doc-
ument with your word processing software. Manually proofread the
document as well.
Put yourself in the position of the person who must sort through and filter out the
resumes and then in the position of the department head. Make their jobs easier by
making your resume attractive, applicable, easy to understand, and flawless. If you
follow these suggestions, your chances of receiving an interview will improve.
Distributing Your Resume
You may distribute your resume in a number of ways: sending it as a fax, attach-
ing it to an e-mail, or uploading it so the organization can scan it.
Fax Your Resume.
If you have spent hours printing your resume on bond paper
of perfect quality and color, and perhaps have even used colored ink for just the
right amount of accent, the fruits of those labors will be lost in faxing it. However,
faxing does have the advantage of expediency. Employers will often request that
resumes be faxed to save time. Consider the following if you are asked to fax your
resume or if you simply determine that faxing is appropriate:
• A faxed resume will probably not be confidential. In fact, several people may
see it before the designated receiver. You may be able to avoid this disclosure by
telephoning the recipient just prior to sending the fax and asking him or her to
collect the faxed document.
• A faxed resume should always include a cover letter, just like the resume you
mail or deliver.
• If your resume is attractive enough to earn you points, mail an original in addi-
tion to sending the fax.
E-Mail Your Resume.
E-mailing your resume and cover letter might be prefer-
able to faxing it. E-mailing has the advantage of keeping the document relatively
confidential. However, it does not guarantee that the document will look more at-
tractive. Although the document may look perfect on your screen, it may not have
exactly the same format on the recipient’s screen or printer. If you e-mail your re-
sume, also send a backup copy in the postal mail.
Although e-mailing your resume is a good option, some employers may not
want to receive your resume as an e-mail attachment. This is due to proliferation
of computer viruses spread by opening attachments. If the employer has not re-
quested your resume be sent as an e-mail attachment and you choose to send it
that way, know that the receiver may decide not to open it.

Resume Checklist
Before submitting your resume, use the above checklist to ensure your document
will appeal to an interviewer.Resumes with spelling and grammatical errors are rou-
tinely discarded by employers because of the carelessness such errors demonstrate.
COVER LETTERS
A cover letter is a sales letter that is selling a product. The product is you. The main
purpose of a cover letter, also called application letter, is to introduce your resume in
the hope of obtaining an interview. Cover letters are either prospecting or solicited.
Prospecting Letter
A prospecting cover letter represents your initial effort at locating an employer seek-
ing the qualifications you have to offer and at convincing the employer to consider
your qualifications. You increase your cover letter’s chances of gaining attention
when you submit a resume along with it. Let the reader know what qualifications

you possess so he or she can compare them with the requirements of the positions
available within the organization.
Organize your cover letter around the steps of a sales presentation:
1. Use an opening that gets the reader’s attention and arouses interest in know-
ing more about your qualifications.
2. Emphasize facts that will convince the prospective employer you possess qual-
ifications that match the requirements of a position he or she is trying to fill.
3. Make a brief reference to the resume you are enclosing.
4. Use a closing that requests action, which in most cover letters is a request for
an interview. These points are illustrated in the cover letter in Figure 4.

Preparing for Your Employment
Solicited Letter
When you hear or read about a job opening, write a solicited (invited) letter. A so-
licited letter can be more specific than a prospecting letter because the applicant
knows a job opening exists.
Use the first paragraph to refer to the job and to reveal how you found out about
it. Include a reference to the source. Request in the opening paragraph that you be
considered for the job. Figure 5 presents a partial sample solicited cover letter.
Write a persuasive letter in such a way that you discuss every requirement men-
tioned in the announcement and show how you meet these qualifications.
Enclose a resume and refer to it in the letter. In the resume, highlight all the
qualifications and key words mentioned in the announcement, and include others
that may contribute to your getting the job.
Close the letter by requesting action, which usually is a request for an inter-
view in which to discuss your qualifications for the job.

106

Preparing for Your Employment
Appearance of the Cover Letter
Print your cover letter on good 81⁄2 × 11 inch bond paper that matches the quality
and shade of the paper used for your resume. Include your personal information
above the date. Because your letter could get separated from your resume, put your
complete mailing address on both the letter and the resume.
Address the letter to a specific person if possible. Make an effort to locate the
name of the employer to whom the letter should be addressed. This information
can be obtained with a single telephone call to the company. It is acceptable to ad-
dress the cover letter to Human Resources Representative.
Limit your letter to one page. Because you have organized all your facts in the ac-
companying resume, you should limit your cover letter to three or four well-written
paragraphs. Most letter styles are acceptable. The key factors in appearance are
• Keep the font and format conservative.
• Keep the appearance professional.
• Keep the information balanced on the page.
Time the arrival of your letter for the most attention. If your letter arrives on
Monday, it arrives with the weekend delivery. If your letter arrives on Friday, it
may get ignored among the week’s backlog. Some authorities agree that your let-
ter should arrive on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
Cover Letter Checklist
A cover letter is the window to your resume, so it is critical that your letter gives the
best view of your skills. Consider your cover letter as one of your marketing tools.
Refer to the checklist below to help create a cover letter that will gain attention.
APPLICATION FORMS
During your job campaign, you will be asked to complete application forms. Your
resume does not substitute for a completed application form; you will be asked to
complete one. Be sure to complete each section of the application. If a question on
the application form does not apply to you, write,“Not Applicable” or “Does Not
Apply” in the blank. If a question calls for salary expected and you do not want
to state a figure, write, “Open to Negotiation,” which means you would prefer to

Preparing for Your Employment
discuss salary once an offer of employment is made. If you leave the answer blank,
the employer may assume
• You were careless and missed the question.
• You did not understand the question.
Either of these assumptions may eliminate you from the potential pool of
candidates.
Each organization designs its own form for employee recruitment in order to
include the specific questions it wants applicants to answer. Nevertheless, most ap-
plication forms are similar.
Supplying information on the application form you are requested to complete
is a significant part of your job search. Follow the instructions carefully and sup-
ply the information exactly as it is called for. If the instruction reads, “Please
print,” do so. Your printing must be legible. After all, you want the application
form to stand out.
Prepare your answers before you write on or key the application form. When
you do this, your form will appear neat and organized. A completed application
form becomes part of the permanent record of the applicant who is hired.
Be prepared to complete the application. Do you:
• have a pen, preferably black ink?
• know the current date?
• have the names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail ad-
dresses for your references?
• have the dates of previous employment?
• have a list of your volunteer activities and the associations to which you belong?
• have the dates you attended high school and post-secondary institutions?
• know your Social Security number?
• know the exact title of the position for which you are applying?
Complete the form as requested even if you have your resume with you. If it is ac-
ceptable, staple a copy of your resume to the back of the application form.
PORTFOLIOS
A portfolio is one of the best marketing tools you can have on a job interview. It
is a collection of samples of your best work and should include only perfect work;
nothing less than perfect is acceptable.
A portfolio is often presented in electronic form.An e-portfolio should contain
the same documents as a hard copy portfolio; however, the documents will be
stored on a personal Web site or arranged in an electronic folder. An e-portfolio

requires the applicant to take a notebook computer to the interview. An advantage
of the e-portfolio is the ease of sending it to or leaving it with an employer. Note
that due to the spread of computer viruses, many employers may not want to open
a folder of materials that is sent as an e-mail attachment. In this case, storing an 
e-portfolio on a personal web site and providing a hyperlink from the e-mail to the
web site would be preferable.
When a hard copy portfolio is used, no writing of any kind should appear on
the documents.
Regardless of whether the portfolio is presented on paper or electronically, it
should contain samples of your original work and be highly organized. One sug-
gestion is to organize it into sections such as
• Correspondence
• Spreadsheets
• Tables
• Graphics
• Minutes of meetings
• Reports
• Newsletters or advertisements
• Web site developments
It should also contain
• Your transcript of grades (but only if it is impressive)
• Letter(s) of reference
• Certificates earned
• Recognition awards
When using an e-portfolio, transcripts, letters of reference, certificates, and
awards should be scanned and stored electronically.
All portfolios must be well organized. To give the hard copy portfolio an or-
ganized appearance, use a table of contents, dividers, and title pages. Protect all
documents by placing them in plastic sleeves. Then package all of the work into
an attractive leather or simulated leather case with rings to hold the pages. Do not
use a binder, since it doesn’t have the professional appearance you need. Keep your
e-portfolio organized by using web page links or electronic folders with titles that
accurately reflect the contents.
During the interview, find an appropriate opportunity to introduce the portfolio
and discuss your work with the interviewer. Remember the portfolio is not intended
to be an information tool. It is a sales tool and the product it is promoting is you!

Preparing for Your Employment
Interviewing for a Position
A job interview gives you an opportunity to convince a prospective employer
that you can make a real contribution to the organization. An interviewer can
judge your basic qualifications by studying your transcript, cover letter, resume,
test results, and completed application form. During the interview, the inter-
viewer will evaluate your personality, attitudes, professional appearance, and
ability to communicate (Figure 6). An impressive school record and evidence
that you possess the necessary office technology skills are pluses, but your suc-
cess in landing the position you want will depend upon the way you project
yourself during the interview.
Remember, the purpose of the interview is twofold:
1. to give the interviewer an opportunity to evaluate the applicant
2. to give the applicant a chance to appraise the job and the organization.
The interview is not just for the benefit of the employer. It should be mutually
beneficial. Sometimes getting an interview is extremely difficult. If getting an in-
terview seems impossible, don’t get discouraged. This difficulty may reflect the
competition for jobs in your specific area or geographic location.
Try to schedule several interviews with organizations you believe will offer the
type of work you are seeking. Don’t set your expectations on one particular posi-
tion. Becoming overly anxious about getting a particular position can create un-
necessary tension. Nevertheless, you should enter each interview with the attitude
the job you are applying for is precisely the one you want.As you learn more about
the job, it may become the position you want.

BEFORE THE INTERVIEW
Prepare thoroughly for each interview. Your preparation should include:
• researching the organization with which you have scheduled the interview;
• learning what the current salaries are for office professionals (including ad-
ministrative assistants, executive assistants, and information specialists) in the
community;
• summarizing your qualifications;
• deciding which qualifications to emphasize;
• anticipating the interviewer’s questions;
• formulating your answers to the interviewer’s questions;
• choosing clothes appropriate for the interview;
• scheduling ample time for getting ready and arriving for the interview;
• traveling to the location of the interview.
Research
Researching the organization is crucial. The following are effective research
methods:
• using the Internet to study the organization;
• exploring the organization in the reference section of the library;
• reading the organization’s most recent annual report;
• calling the organization’s receptionist and requesting information.
Learn all you can about the organization. Research
• the organization’s products or services;
• how profitable the organization is;
• the number of employees the organization has;
• how long the organization has been operating;
• the extent of the company’s operations;
• any recent expansion the company may have experienced;
• any mergers or name changes the company has undergone;
• the company’s competitive standing in the industry;
• the organization’s hiring practices.
Many applicants do poorly during an interview because they lack knowledge
about the organization. The interviewer will tell you about the organization and
its employment opportunities, but you will be able to converse with more ease and
ask pertinent questions if you have researched the organization. Lack of knowl-
edge could be viewed by the interviewer as lack of interest in the organization. Pre-
pare thoroughly; show your interest in the organization through your knowledge
about it.
Before the interview, research the current salary ranges in your geographic area
for the position you are seeking. The best way to do this is by researching the In-
ternet for salary comparison tools. These sites allow you to enter the job title and
geographic location by city, state, or ZIP code.

Anticipate Questions
Think about what you have to offer and the qualifications you want to emphasize.
Review your resume before you go to the interview. The interviewer will expect
you to discuss your job objective and why you feel qualified for the position. You
should be prepared to talk about yourself in an organized way without hesitation.
Anticipate questions the interviewer will ask and know what your answers will
be. In an attempt to determine if you can handle the job, the employer may ask
one or more of the following:
1. What do you know about this company?
2. What do you know about the position you are applying for?
3. We are looking for someone with extensive experience. Your resume indicates
limited experience as an administrative assistant (or whatever the title). How
do you expect to compensate for your lack of experience?
4. Why do you think you might like to work for this organization?
5. What do you expect to be doing three years from now? Five years from now?
6. Why did you choose a career as an administrative assistant?
7. Relating to the responsibilities described in the advertisement for this posi-
tion, what strengths will you bring to our company?
8. Relating to the responsibilities described in the advertisement for this posi-
tion, what responsibilities do you believe will be your greatest challenges?
How do you expect to meet these challenges?
9. How do you rate the education you have received?
10. Throughout your training to be an administrative assistant, what courses did
you enjoy the most? Least? Why?
11. Describe the qualities of a good leader. Have you encountered a person like
this? Where and when?
12. Describe the characteristics of a poor leader. Have you encountered a person
like this? Where and when?
13. Do you plan to continue your education? How? What field? Why is this im-
portant to you?
14. If you were a team leader, what type of team members would you pick? If your
team members did not meet your expectations, what action would you take?
15. What are your feelings about working overtime?
At the beginning of the interview you may be asked some general questions re-
lating to your personal interests, or you may be asked to give your opinion about
the latest current events. Some interviewers begin with questions they think will
put the applicant at ease. Answer all questions thoroughly but without rambling.
Consider your answers to all questions; the interviewer is searching for qualified
employees who will stay with the organization if they are hired.
To gain insight into your personality and to check on your attitude, the inter-
viewer may ask the following:
• Give an example of how you have displayed initiative.
• How do you spend your leisure time?
• What personality characteristics do you think are essential for the position you
are seeking?
• How do you accept criticism?
112

Preparing for Your Employment
• Provide an example of a situation in which you were criticized.
• Describe the best/worst employer/teacher you have ever had.
• Explain a stressful situation you encountered and describe how you handled it.
Behavioral Descriptive Questions
An applicant can prepare thoroughly for an interview; however, it is impossible to
anticipate all possible interview scenarios. Behavioral descriptive questions are
commonly used by interviewers to sort facts from exaggerations. These interviews
use a “demo” questioning technique, in which each question leads to the next and
probes deeper into an experience or scenario described by the applicant. A typical
set of behavioral interview questions is
1. Describe a situation where you were a team member and conflict arose within
the team.
2. What did you do to resolve this conflict?
3. What did you learn from this experience?
4. Since the conflict, how have you applied what you learned?
5. Who has benefited from your ability to resolve conflict?
Some applicants feel intimidated by the probing nature of these questions.
However, these questions, if presented in a diplomatic manner, are highly success-
ful in determining the best candidate. Because many people embellish their re-
sumes and then perform well at exaggerating their talents during the interview, the
best candidate is not always selected for the job.
Behavioral descriptive questions are not difficult to answer if the candidate has
the experience the recruiter is seeking. If you are asked a behavioral descriptive
question and simply don’t have the experience necessary to answer the question,
be honest. The best policy is to tell the interviewer that you have no experience in
this particular area. If you have related experience, ask the interviewer if you might
refer to a similar situation in a different type of environment.
Illegal Questions
Interviewers who want information on topics, such as marital status, age, smok-
ing habits, or race, must phrase their questions very carefully. Many questions re-
lating to these topics are illegal. For example, an interviewer cannot ask an older
person if he or she would be considering retirement in the next few years. If the
candidate’s response is “yes,”the interviewer cannot base the employment decision
on this response.
No questions should be asked about national origin. The interviewer can ask
what languages you speak and write fluently but should not ask what your native
tongue is. You should not be asked questions about your ethnic background or
race. Although the interviewer can ask, “Are you a citizen of the United States?”
he or she cannot ask, “Of what country are you a citizen?”
The interviewer can ask if you have a valid driver’s license and if you have ever
been convicted of a crime, but he or she cannot ask if you have ever been arrested.
To avoid potential unethical questions being asked during interviews, employ-
ers are advised how to conduct job interviews without violating the law.
Ask Relative Questions
An interviewer will expect you to ask questions, too. Some interviews lend them-
selves to the applicant asking questions periodically throughout the interview,
113

Preparing for Your Employment
whereas other interviews give the applicant an opportunity at the end of the in-
terview to ask questions.Your research prior to the interview should help you gen-
erate a list of appropriate questions. State that you have researched the company
Web site and that you prepared a few questions. Select appropriate questions, take
the sheet to the interview, and refer to it. The following is a list of relative ques-
tions to ask during an interview:
• To whom would I report? To how many people would I report?
• What are opportunities for advancement from this position?
• Why is this position open? Is it a newly created position?
• What personal qualities improve the likelihood for success in this position?
• How would you describe the corporate culture of this organization?
• What is the organization’s mission?
• What are the major barriers for this organization to fulfill its mission?
• I read in the . . . that you are expanding your . . . division. How would that
affect the position I am applying for?
• Does the organization have a human resource development program?
Make a Statement with Your Appearance
Although first impressions rarely win jobs, your appearance—your clothes, hair,
cosmetics, jewelry, and shoes—can certainly cost you the job before you ever open
your mouth. Your goal is to look the part of a professional, one who would rep-
resent the organization in positive ways. Your appearance should make the state-
ment that you are a professional and that you want to be taken seriously. This is
true even in companies that have a casual dress policy. Companies that encourage
their employees to dress casually still expect applicants to dress and act profes-
sionally in the interview. Once they are successful and join the staff, they may
adopt the company’s dress code.
Spend the extra time it takes to look well groomed. Dress conservatively be-
cause you want the interviewer to focus on your answers without being distracted
by your appearance. By applying the checklist below to your interview prepara-
tion, you may be able to convey the proper message.
Whatever you decide will be your image for an interview, consider the strong
nonverbal message that your image sends.
Interview Preparation Checklist
✓Your hair should be neat and away from your face.
✓Your nails should be well manicured and clean.
✓Shoes should be clean, polished, and conventional.
✓Body odor should be eliminated.
✓The most appropriate choice of color is a variation of black,
navy, brown, or gray.
✓Acceptable business clothing for women can be more colorful
than that of their male counterparts,although clothing still must
be conservative.
✓Cosmetics should be used sparingly.
✓Jewelry should be simple and minimal, yet complementary.
✓Professional attire should include a suit jacket.
✓Clothing should not be revealing; skirts should be a comfort-
able length and blouses should never reveal cleavage or
camisole.
✓Cologne or perfume and hand lotion should be avoided. A fra-
grance that is attractive to you could be offensive to another
person.
114

Preparing for Your Employment
Be Punctual
Know the exact location of the interview. Plan to arrive ten to fifteen minutes early so
you can avoid rushing before the interview.You can undermine yourself before the in-
terview by becoming stressed because you did not allow yourself enough time. A few
days before the interview, travel to the office and note the time it takes to arrive. On
the actual day of the interview, allow more time than is needed to get to the location.
Never schedule two interviews in the same morning or afternoon. You have no
control over the length of an interview, and you will not feel at ease if you are con-
cerned about time.
Know What to Take to the Interview
For the interview, you will want to have important materials on hand, but you will
not want to be encumbered with items you do not need.
You should avoid bringing the following items to an interview. (Although it
seems like common sense not to bring them, many employers report that appli-
cants often do.)
• Never bring packages. Avoid shopping immediately before an interview, unless
you can leave all the packages in a locker or in your car.
• Women should never carry a large purse. A small handbag with only necessary
items will not distract from a professional appearance. Instead of carrying a
backpack, men should carry a folder or small portfolio folder.
• Men and women should never carry a briefcase that is oversized or resembles a
schoolbag. Keep everything neat and simple and nondistracting.
• Never enter the interview with a cell phone turned on. So that you will not be
distracted, turn off all signals that alert you of an incoming call or message.
• Most important of all, never bring another person. Naturally you wouldn’t bring
another person into the interview, but a number of applicants make plans to meet
friends or relatives immediately after the interview.You need to concentrate on the
interview, not on your friends or relatives waiting in the lobby or reception area.
In particular, don’t bring children because their behavior may cause you to worry.
Demonstrate that you are an independent person; arrive alone and leave alone.
Here’s what you should take to the interview:
• Your portfolio, if prepared to a professional standard, will be one of the best
sales tools you have. Bring it to the interview and look for the perfect opportu-
nity to walk through it with the interviewer.
• Always bring along a pen and paper to write down important facts you learn
during the interview. Your pen should be attractive and in good condition. One
that has been chewed or runs out of ink will not leave the interviewer with the
best impression.
• Bring extra copies of your resume. Offer copies to the interviewer just as the in-
terview is ready to begin. Doing so demonstrates your preparation.You will also
need a copy for yourself to refer to throughout the interview.
• If references do not appear on your resume, you should bring a list of three or
more references that includes names, titles, company names, addresses, tele-
phone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses. The list should be attractively
keyed on a single sheet. Be prepared to leave this sheet with the interviewer.
• Bring along a version of the advertisement if one was posted or appeared in the
newspaper. Highlight the key responsibilities listed. Don’t be afraid to bring out
115

Preparing for Your Employment
the ad and refer to it during the interview. Doing so shows you know exactly what
type of position you are applying for and that you are prepared for the interview.
• Bring along your list of questions; you can list the responsibilities of the posi-
tion and, for each, identify specific examples of how you have demonstrated
competence. Don’t be afraid to refer to this sheet during the interview.The sheet
should appear neat and organized and, of course, should be keyed.
• With desktop publishing, you can prepare personal business cards that are pro-
fessional looking by printing them on cardstock. Or, for a nominal charge, you
can have a professional printer produce a small number of business cards with
your name and contact information. The applicant who leaves a business card
leaves a professional image.
DURING THE INTERVIEW
Be courteous, confident, and composed. As you approach the interviewer, smile,
greet the interviewer by name, and introduce yourself; for example, “Hello,
Mr. Schichili. My name is Courtney Luttrell.” If the interviewer extends a hand,
give a firm handshake. This gesture will express your confidence. Try to relax. You
will probably feel a little nervous because the interview is important to you. If you
feel nervous, don’t call attention to your nervousness by twisting your hair, tap-
ping your foot, thumping on the table, sitting on the edge of the chair, talking too
rapidly, or showing other outward nervous signs.
You may be interviewed by one person or by a group of interviewers, especially
common among companies that are driven by a consensus or team concept.
The interviewers have a job to perform; they must match an applicant to the re-
quirements of the position to be filled. The initial interview probably will last
thirty minutes or more. An effective interviewer will allow the applicant to talk
throughout most of the interview. The interviewer may be an HR representative
who will ask more general questions. If the HR representative is the hiring man-
ager, his or her questions will be more specific and job-related.
Some interviewers break the interview into the following segments:
1. getting acquainted;
2. presenting the organization’s opportunities;
3. evaluating the applicant;
4. answering the applicant’s questions.
Others begin the interview with one or more broad, open-ended questions,
such as “Tell me about yourself,” turning the discussion over to the interviewee at
once. The interviewer controls the interview by telling the interviewee to discuss

Preparing for Your Employment
specific topics. When this interviewing technique is used, the conversation seems
spontaneous rather than structured.
While the interviewer is talking, listen intently. Give the interviewer an oppor-
tunity to talk; show that you are an active listener.
When you are asked a question, give a full answer, not simply a “yes”or “no.”The
interviewer will ask a question or a comment to introduce a topic you are expected to
discuss. Look the interviewer in the eye and answer all questions frankly. Be deliberate;
do not start talking before the interviewer completes the question. Avoid talking too
much; keep to the point. Do not attempt to answer a question you do not understand.
Either restate the question as you understand it or ask the interviewer to clarify it.
While you are talking, keep your goal in mind, which is to promote yourself.
Use every opportunity to emphasize your good points and to relate them to what
you can do for the organization. To sound sincere, present facts, not your opinion,
about yourself. Don’t criticize yourself and never make derogatory remarks about
an instructor or a former supervisor or employer.
As you are talking, the interviewer will evaluate your mental and physical
alertness, your ability to communicate, your attitude toward life and toward the
organization, and your enthusiasm for work. Some interviewers will give tests in
order to evaluate your skill level.
As discussed in the section “Before the Interview,” you should prepare ques-
tions to ask at the interview. Every interviewer likes to be asked questions. The
questions you prepare must be relevant to the organization or to the job opportu-
nity. If all your prepared questions have been discussed during the interview and
you are left without questions to ask, ask the interviewer to elaborate further on
a statement or on details given earlier in the interview.
What About Salary?
At the initial interview, your questions should not concern salary or benefits. Reserve
these questions until you are offered the position. However, if the interviewer asks
you about your expected salary, be prepared to state a range. Remember that the fig-
ure the interviewer is likely to remember and focus on is the low end of your range.
If you have prepared a personal budget and have researched office salaries
in your area, you will know an appropriate starting salary for this employment
opportunity.
The best time to negotiate salary is after the job offer has been made. How-
ever, the interviewer is in control of the interview; if the interviewer asks you a
salary question during the interview, you must answer it.
Remember that although salary is often a negotiable item, these negotiations
must be handled with diplomacy.Although job satisfaction will be achieved mostly
through obtaining a challenging and responsible position, don’t sell yourself short
when salary is discussed. If you have earned a post-secondary certificate and degree
and have experience in the field, you have gained bargaining power.
Closing the Interview Confidently
Watch for cues that the interview is coming to an end. The interviewer may thank
you for coming, suggest you schedule a time to take employment tests, invite you
to arrange for a second interview, stand up and say you will hear by a certain date
if the organization is interested in you, or offer you the position.
A good closure to an interview would include the following actions:
• Firmly shaking hands.
• Restating your interest in the position. Example: “Please consider me for the po-
sition.I feel confident I would make a positive contribution to your organization.”
117

Preparing for Your Employment
• Checking the follow-up procedure that will be employed by the organization.
Example: “When might I expect to hear from you? If I don’t hear from you by
that date, may I contact you?”
• Leaving a business card.
If you are offered the position, you are not expected to accept it on the spot.
You are making a long-term commitment, and you should be sure it is the position
you want. The interviewer would prefer you give it enough thought to be ab-
solutely certain. You may accept at once if you have no doubt about it. Otherwise,
tactfully say you would like time to consider it. Ask if you can let the interviewer
know in a day or two or at some definite, mutually agreed-upon time.
You cannot always accurately judge how you are being rated. Interviewers
who rely on the second interview, which is discussed later in this chapter, for mak-
ing a decision are noncommittal during the initial interview. Appear interested and
confident as the interview draws to a close. Always express appreciation to the in-
terviewer before leaving.
AFTER THE INTERVIEW
Make each interview a learning experience. Ask yourself the following questions
to improve your self-promotion techniques:
• What points did I make that seemed to interest the interviewer?
• Did I present my qualifications well?
• Did I overlook any qualifications that are pertinent to the position?
• Did I learn all I need to know about the position, or did I forget or hesitate to
ask about factors that are important to me?
• Did I talk too much? Not enough?
• Did I interview the employer rather than permit the employer to interview me?
• Was I too tense?
• Was I too aggressive? Not assertive enough?
• How can I improve my next interview?
THE CAMPUS INTERVIEW
Most organizations actively recruit post-secondary graduates. Your career center
will set up appointments for students nearing graduation to be interviewed by rep-
resentatives from various companies. These interviews often occur on campus.
Stress your strong points, and listen attentively. In response to the interviewer’s
questions, relate how you meet the qualifications for the job. Project your person-
ality, and ask relevant questions.
Don’t expect that because the interview is held on campus you should dress ca-
sually. Give the interviewer a chance to see how you would look on the job if the

interviewer hired you. You will look capable of accepting responsibility if you
dress accordingly. The interviewer will be comparing your appearance with that of
office professionals who already work for the organization, not with the appear-
ance of other college students.
If, as a result of the campus interview, you are invited for a second interview
or to take tests, be sure to get the exact address. Write down the date, time, ad-
dress, and name of the person who will meet with you.

Testing
The career center staff and your instructors may know which organizations in
your area give tests. If you apply for a job with an organization that administers
tests, be prepared to take at least a word processing production test, a basic math
test, a keyboarding test, and a spelling test. The organization could test your skill
on any software application or test your ability to compose correspondence.
If you apply for a position at a staffing agency, you will probably be asked to take
tests at its location. Be prepared for similar tests, such as basic math, keyboarding, and
spelling tests. In addition, you will probably be asked to take computerized tests in
word processing, spreadsheets, and databases.The computerized tests generally direct
you to perform a function using specific software. Your score will likely be based on
your responses to using the software menus, icons, and keystrokes.
Many tests have time limits. Listen carefully to the instructions you receive.
If you do not clearly understand what you are expected to do, ask questions.
You will be expected to perform at speed levels determined by the organization
administering the tests. Test results are usually evaluated by degree of accuracy.
Personality tests and mental ability tests are popular. It is not possible to pre-
pare for these tests.The goal of these examinations is to determine which applicants
will work well with existing staff members, which applicants will most likely share
the company’s goals, and which applicants have potential leadership skills.
Composing Follow-Up Letters
The letters essential for continuing and finalizing a job search fall into five categories:
1. thank-you
2. reminder
3. inquiry
4. job acceptance
5. refusal
119

Preparing for Your Employment
Compose follow-up letters on the same quality paper you used for the resume,
and be sure to include your return address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail
address. Check them carefully for accuracy. Be sure that the organization’s name
and the interviewer’s name are spelled correctly.
All of the letters can be sent as e-mail messages, but your choice to use this
method will depend on the formality of the situation. Most employers are inter-
ested in quick and to-the-point communication, so e-mail is very appropriate.
However, where the environment is very formal, a letter on bond paper may be
necessary.
THANK-YOU LETTER
Writing a thank-you letter following an interview is not a requirement but a cour-
tesy. Always write a thank-you letter and send it immediately after the interview.
If you want the position for which you were interviewed, you can use a thank-you
letter to do far more than express appreciation to the interviewer. Not everyone
writes thank-you letters; consequently, when your thank-you letter arrives at the
interviewer’s desk, it will single you out from other applicants and call attention
once more to your application.
Say that you definitely are interested in the position and that you want to be
considered seriously for it. When interviewers are considering several applicants
with apparently equal qualifications, one question they are trying to answer is
“Which applicant has the keenest interest in working for our organization?”
Keep your letter brief. In the opening paragraph, thank the interviewer, men-
tioning either the day or the date of the interview and the specific position discussed.
Use the remainder of the letter to refer to something specific about the interview and
to express interest in the job. Close with a statement to let the interviewer know you
are waiting for a reply. Here is an example of how one applicant expressed interest:
Talking with you last Wednesday afternoon about the duties of an administra-
tive assistant with Midwestern Products convinced me that this is exactly the
position I am seeking.
I appreciate the time you spent with me, discussing employment opportunities
with your company and describing the requirements for an administrative
assistant’s position. I feel confident I can meet these requirements, and I am
waiting to hear that you also feel I can.
Reminders
When you do not receive a response to an application or are told that your appli-
cation has been placed on file, write another letter after a few weeks have elapsed
to remind the interviewer that you still are interested. You will find reminder let-
ters especially helpful when you plan to move from one geographic section of the
United States to another and make inquiries about positions months in advance of
your availability for employment.
Do not assume your resume has been kept on file. Send another copy of your
resume with your reminder letter. In the opening paragraph, mention the posi-
tion you applied for and when. In the body of the letter, briefly state your inter-
est in working for that particular organization, express confidence about what
you can do for the organization, and ask if an opening for the type of position

In January, I inquired about employment opportunities for office support with
your company and sent you a resume detailing my qualifications. Modern Plas-
tics is a company that has enjoyed rapid growth, and I would like to be a mem-
ber of its dynamic team.
Next week I am moving to Denver. May I please schedule an appointment
during the week of May 25 to discuss my qualifications for employment as an
assistant with Modern Plastics? Please reply to my Denver mailing address.
For your convenience, I am enclosing a copy of the cover letter and resume I
sent to you in January. I look forward to receiving a positive response. Thank
you for your assistance.
Inquiry
Following a job interview, you can write a letter of inquiry or make a telephone
call if you have not heard anything by the time the interviewer said you would re-
ceive a reply. Be patient. Wait a day or two beyond the time you are expecting a
reply and, if you do not hear, telephone or write to inquire. If you are told the po-
sition has not been filled, indicate that you definitely are interested.
Job Acceptance
Even when you accept a job offer during an interview or over the telephone, fol-
low up with an e-mail or a letter. You will probably receive a letter offering you a
position and suggesting you call to accept. Respond by telephone, but also send a
letter to leave no doubt about your acceptance. The letter offering you the posi-
tion, plus your written response, should contain all the elements of a contract and,
as such, constitute a contract.
In the opening, accept the job enthusiastically. Mention the specific position
being accepted. If you have received a form for supplying additional information,
complete it, enclose it, and refer to it in your letter. Repeat the report-to-work in-
structions, giving the date, time, and place. In either the opening or the closing, ex-
press appreciation. Keep a copy of the letter of offer and your reply. Here is an
example of an acceptance response:
As I expressed over the telephone, I am delighted to accept the position of admin-
istrative assistant in the International Markets Division of Midwestern Products.
Enclosed are the forms you requested I complete after my interview last week.
I appreciate the opportunity to join your team and am eager to report to work
on Monday, June 16, at 8 a.m. Thank you for selecting me for the position.
Job Refusal
If you conduct a thorough job campaign, you may be offered more than one job.
In this case, you will have to refuse all but one offer.What a good problem to have!
Be as prompt in refusing as possible. If you have already accepted a position, re-
fuse the second offer at once. This is a courtesy you owe the person who must
search elsewhere to fill the position offered you.
you are seeking exists. You may be successful with composing a letter similar to
this example: 
121

Preparing for Your Employment
Since your letter will be disappointing to the reader, you should organize it in the
same way you organize other letters of disappointment. Begin by making a favorable
statement concerning your contact with the interviewer or about the organization.Ex-
press appreciation for the job offer at either the beginning or the end of the letter. In-
clude at least one reason for refusing the offer. State the refusal tactfully, but make it
clear you are refusing. By making a definite statement about already having accepted
a position or about your continuing to search for a particular job, you will be refus-
ing the offer without making a negative statement. Close with a positive comment.
Don’t burn your bridges—you may want to work for the organization at some
point in the future. Check your letter to make sure the attitude reflected by your
statements does not close the door for you. In the following example, the writer
shows appreciation and says he would be interested in a more senior position:

Conducting an Electronic Job Search
Computers and telecommunications have changed almost every facet of the way
we work. In fact, they have played a part in how we search for work. The Internet
has become a popular tool for searching for available employment and for post-
ing resumes for potential employers to view.
Searching the Web for employment opportunities will not eliminate the need
to practice traditional job-hunting techniques, but it does add another dimension
to your job search. Not only will you be able to find positions available, but you
can also locate names of companies within a specific ZIP code in your area.
Job announcement databases are available for browsing. By browsing through
Web sites, you will reach many online job search facilities. Here are two popular
Web locations:
• www.monster.com
• www.careerbuilder.com
Thank you for the offer to become an information specialist in the Research De-

In the highly competitive search for work, the Internet has become a new job
market. The Web may be used for job searching, but it is also useful for sending
your resume to one of the online career services. The online career service will ask
you to either complete the online resume builder form, or send a copy of your re-
sume. Your resume information now becomes part of a database that is accessible
to employers looking for employees with specific qualifications.
Any reputable online career service keeps confidential the personal portion of
your resume (name, addresses, and contact numbers). When an employer believes
your credentials match a job opportunity available, the employer will offer to pur-
chase your name and contact numbers.With your permission, the online career ser-
vice will release the information to the paying customer—a potential employer.
Scan Your Resume
A growing number of companies are using electronic scanning systems to digitally
scan, store, and track resumes and cover letters, which will be discussed in the fol-
lowing section. In fact, hundreds of resumes can be scanned in only a few minutes.
A scannable resume has a plain format that allows companies to scan it as pure
text. When recruiters wish to retrieve a group of qualified candidates, they supply
key words that are essential for the right applicant. These key words will identify
expertise, experience, and education. For example, they might include such words
as bilingual, desktop publishing, database management, and teams. The computer
software scans the database, and within minutes a list of applicants whose resumes
match the stated criteria is brought to the screen.
Refer to Figure 7 for an example of a partial resume that has been prepared
for electronic scanning.
Scanned resumes save the recruiter a lot of time. However, even a resume with
extensive credentials may go unnoticed if the scanner cannot identify them. Scan-
ning can dramatically change the appearance of your resume. Many scanning pro-
grams make mistakes when reading words or special characters. To ensure all the
information on your resume is collected by the electronic system, follow these tips
to be sure your resume is scanner friendly:
1. Describe your personal traits in nouns, not verbs.
2. Use the key words found in the job ad.
3. Use straightforward words to describe your experience. Embellished terms
will not be on the list of skills for which the recruiter is searching.
4. Use multiple pages if necessary. Unlike humans, computers do not tire of reading.
5. Increase your lists of key words. Include specific software names, such as
Microsoft® Word.
6. Use common resume headings, such as Objective, Education, Experience, and
Interests.
To keep your resume clean and simple, steer clear of these practices:
1. Don’t use italics. Instead, use a standard typeface.
2. Don’t use bullets. Instead, use asterisks and hyphens.
3. Don’t bold any text.
4. Don’t underline or use graphic lines.
5. Don’t use indents or centering.
6. Don’t print your resume on colored paper.
One advantage of an electronic scanning system is that electronic storage takes
so much less space than paper storage. This means resumes may be kept on file for
an extended period.

FIGURE 7 • Example of partial resume that has been prepared for electronic scanning.
If applicants are not aware of the electronic scanning process and submit attrac-
tive yet traditionally formatted resumes, they may not be identified by the computer,
no matter how outstanding.The best approach when you do not know whether elec-
tronic or human screening will be used is to submit two resumes.The resume intended
for human scrutiny should be printed on attractive paper, using highlighting features,
graphic lines, and other design elements. Place a removable note on the nicely
formatted resume that states,“Visual Resume.” Place another removable note on the
resume destined for scanning that says,“Scannable Resume.”The reason you have in-
cluded two resumes should be briefly explained in your cover letter.

Making Decisions Regarding
Employment Opportunities
Decisions, decisions, decisions! As a job searcher, what happens if you are offered
several positions of which any one would be ideal for you? Which one do you
choose? How do you learn to make good decisions?
There is a need for thinking skills, including decision making and problem solv-
ing. The same steps to solve a problem can be applied to the following situation.
After a number of interviews, Chandra has been offered two similar exciting,
challenging positions to work as an administrative assistant in two different com-
panies. Chandra doesn’t know which position to accept. She can’t decide. How
many people have accepted a position to work in a particular environment only to
learn months later they had made the wrong decision? Before Chandra makes a
decision, let’s help her work through the decision-making process.
Step 1 entails gathering all the information she needs to decide. What addi-
tional information does Chandra need to learn about the companies who have of-
fered her the positions? For example, Chandra might contact a few people “who
know someone who knows someone” in these companies. She might research
salaries in the San Francisco Bay area where the companies are located. She might
also increase her span of knowledge about the companies. At this point, she might
do more in-depth research about the companies’ products and services and their
position in their industry. What are the transportation issues?
Chandra has completed Step 2 (Determine what you know) and Step 3 (Deter-
mine if additional information is needed) by studying all the information she had
gathered prior to her interviews, during her interviews, and since she had been
offered these positions. In Step 3, Chandra learned one company would reimburse
100 percent tuition while the second company would reimburse tuition up to 50 percent.
Chandra’s next step—Step 4 (Outline all possible solutions)—is to develop alter-
natives or possible solutions.The more alternatives she can develop, the better her final
decision will be.What alternatives has Chandra been able to develop? Her list includes
• Accept the position where her friend works and with whom she can carpool.
• Accept the position with the smaller company as she had a good feeling about
this employer.
• Continue to look for other potential employment.
At Step 5 (Analyze each solution) and Step 6 (Identify pros and cons), she be-
gins to consider the alternatives and implications. In other words, she must con-
sider all the good points, or pros, and the bad points, or cons, of each alternative.
Here are a few of her considerations:

Preparing for Your Employment
• She must ride the Metro to reach one company while she can carpool to another.
• From a friend who is employed by one of the companies, Chandra has learned
the company has great benefits and shows a progressive working team concept.
• Chandra had a great feeling about the other company and its environment.
• Being reimbursed for 100 percent of tuition appeals to Chandra, who is inter-
ested in continuing her education.
• Benefits are important; however, Chandra’s husband has health insurance cov-
erage through his employer.
As Chandra evaluates each alternative, she must consider the following:
• What will each choice cost her?
• What is the most favorable outcome she can expect from each?
• What is the most unfavorable outcome?
At this point, Chandra may begin discarding one or more alternatives, or she
may discover that she needs more information, which means returning to Step 3
in the process.
In Step 7,Chandra must decide on the best alternative and take action on it.What
is “best” depends on things such as the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the in-
formation gathered in Steps 1, 2, and 3; her ingenuity in developing alternatives in
Step 4; the degree of risk she is willing to take; and the quality of analysis in Step 5.
Sometimes people cannot decide; therefore, they more or less make their decisions
like throwing darts at a board! After considering all the alternatives and implications,
Chandra consciously decided to accept the position with the company where her
friend worked, where she could carpool, and receive up to 50 percent on her tuition.
Once a decision is made, evaluate the results of implementing a decision. To
complete this step, ask yourself the following question: Did my choice accomplish
the desired result? For Chandra, her decision was a good one as in six months she
received a promotion and a salary increase.
If the follow-up and evaluation indicate the desired outcome wasn’t achieved,
you will want to review the decision process to see where you went wrong. Doing
so provides additional opportunities to consider other alternatives as circum-
stances may have changed and allows you to approach your decision again with a
fresh perspective.
Considering International Employment
Working overseas can be an exciting option. The potential benefits to working
abroad are many, including lucrative salaries, tax exemptions, overseas service pre-
miums, free housing, completion bonuses, forty days or more of annual vacation
time, international travel, and education allowances for dependents.

Of the steps described in the decision-making process, which one would you consider to be the most difficult to complete? Why?

Preparing for Your Employment
The range of international employment opportunities available is broader than
most Americans expect. Staffing requirements in the overseas job market areas are
as diverse as in the domestic U.S. market. Highly skilled administrative assistants
are in great demand, particularly if they communicate fluently in English, which is
considered the international language of business.
Individuals with backgrounds in private business, nonprofit organizations, gov-
ernment work, international agencies, teaching, construction, telecommunications,
computer specialties, and management information systems may find opportunities
that will satisfy their interests and pay them better than comparative positions in the
United States.
The curriculum vitae (CV), is used in overseas job hunting. The standard CV
is between two and three pages long and may contain a contact section, references,
detailed information on all former positions held, a list of memberships in profes-
sional organizations, overseas living and working experience, publication credits,
and detailed education information. You will be required to present copies of all
diplomas, certificates, and transcripts, and a copy of your passport as the selection
process progresses. Before hiring, countries may require results of medical exami-
nations and chest X-rays, and proof of up-to-date immunizations as required by
that country.
You should be aware that companies and organizations outside the United
States are under no legal constraints as to what information they may require from
a potential job candidate. Depending on the country in which you are seeking em-
ployment, you should be prepared to provide personal information such as pic-
tures, marital status, date of birth, number of children, and other information that
would be restricted by discrimination laws in the United States.
Research can be conducted easily on the Internet by using a search engine, such
as Google, to search for international resume, international curriculum vitae, or
similar topics.
Interviews conducted for international employment may not follow the same
process as in the United States. For example, you may find that you are asked ques-
tions of a personal nature—about family, marital status, and health. Restrictions
on questions that can be asked will vary with the country’s policies guarding per-
sonal information and human rights issues. Even within the same country, com-
pany interviewing policies may vary, within the guidelines set down by that
country. Researching the Internet for information on the recruitment and inter-
view process before the event will minimize the changes that you will be unpre-
pared for from what you would encounter in the United States.
Quick Tips
PRELIMINARY WORK COMPLETED BEFORE SUBMITTING A RESUME
• Take advantage of the Internet.
• Visit the company’s Web site.
• Learn as much as possible about the company.
• Remember, a good resume doesn’t always mean it will fit job
openings with all companies.
• Tailor your resume to focus on the company’s specific job
opening.
• Editing your resume can be a minor task for you but can
make a major impact on the person reading it!
• Keep a list of the cover letters and resumes you sent, when
you sent them, and to whom.

Concept Review and Reinforcement
Review of Key Concepts
OUTCOME
CONCEPT
1. Identify sources for locating
employment opportunities.
Sources of job prospects include network, campus career centers, offices, job fairs, busi-
ness sections of newspapers and newsletters, direct application, staffing agencies, the
federal government, and newspaper advertisements.
2. Complete a self-assessment
inventory.
A self-appraisal inventory helps organize information about educational back-
ground, work experience, and personal qualities.
3. Describe the significance of
practicing ethical behavior
during the job search.
Employers have a zero tolerance for misrepresenting or falsifying information re-
garding employment, education, or experience.
4. Prepare a resume.
A resume emphasizes employment history, educational background, and special
skills and abilities.
The purpose of a resume is to obtain an interview.
•
Chronological resume: Lists employment history with most recent position
first and identifies specific employers and positions.
•
Functional resume: Itemizes duties and skills, rather than specific employers
and positions.
5. Prepare a cover letter.
Primary purpose of cover letter is to obtain an interview.
Reasons to write a cover letter: When the job you are seeking is located in another
city; when you are answering an ad; and when you mail or fax a resume.
•
An applicant who does not know that a job opening exists writes a prospecting
cover letter.
•
A solicited cover letter is written in response to an announcement that a job
opening exists.
6. Complete an employment
application form.
Application form may be the first impression a company has of you.
•
Be prepared to complete an application: have a black ink pen, information for
references, dates of previous employment, social security number, and exact
title of position for which you are applying.
7. Prepare for an interview.
Purpose of the job interview is twofold: to give interviewer opportunity to evaluate
applicant in terms of needs of organization, and to give applicant a chance to ap-
praise job and organization.
•
Before the interview, prepare thoroughly by researching the organization,
anticipating questions, planning appearance, and organizing important
materials to take to the interview.
•
During the interview, remain courteous, confident, and composed. Listen
intently and answer interviewer’s questions by giving full answers.
•
Discussion about salary is appropriate only after job offer has been made,
unless the interviewer brings up the subject.
•
Watch for cues that interview is closing. Remember to firmly shake hands, restate
interest in position, and check follow-up procedure that the organization will use.
•
Make each interview a learning experience. Ask yourself questions to improve
your self-promotion.

Step 5. Analyze each alternative.
Step 6. Identify pros and cons for each alternative.
Step 7. Select the best decision or solution and at some point, evaluate your
decision.

1. Stretching the truth. Ismael, your best friend, has been
offered a position at your company. Both of you are
excited about his job because it is a great opportunity,
and you will be able to share a ride to work. Once
you learn about the position he has accepted, you are
concerned. You are aware of the qualifications for
the position, and you know that Ismael doesn’t have
some of these qualifications. You suspect that Ismael
may have “stretched” the truth about his qualifica-

2. Becoming informed. A job announcement posted on
the office technology bulletin board appeals to you. A

Building Your Office Skills
Exploring the Workplace: Activities
1. Research the employment ads for positions for which
you qualify or would like to qualify eventually. Make
a list of your top three choices. Include the position
titles, duties, and types of industries in which these
jobs are found—for example, medical, legal, or in-
surance. Describe why you would like to obtain these
positions. Think about the size of the company and
its products or services. List your knowledge, skills,
and abilities that can be applied to your choices.
Evaluate your choices. Consider if one company is
closer to you in location. Do you have transporta-
tion, or must you consider additional costs in getting
to a particular location as one of your choices? As
you evaluate your alternatives, consider the size of
the company. Does it make a difference to you in ben-
efits and/or advancement? Report your summary in
table format in memo form to your instructor.
2. Visit a private staffing service or public office employ-
ment agency in your area to determine how the agency
places its clients in office support positions.During your
visit, gather information about its employment testing
program. For instance, ask the agency to share infor-
mation with you about the kinds of employment tests it
gives for at least three different office support positions.
Report your findings in a memo to your instructor.
3. Visit your campus career center to gather the fol-
lowing information: specific career information
about your chosen occupation, employment oppor-
tunities in your local area, upcoming local job fairs,
and interest surveys or assessments that will help di-
rect you in your chosen occupation. Report your
findings in a memo to your instructor.
4. In your team, develop items for a Do/Don’t check-
list, not to exceed a total of ten items. The items rep-
resent qualities that make a resume acceptable or
unacceptable. Include a rating scale with a range
from 1 to 4, with 1 representing unacceptable (U)
and 4 being acceptable (A). Each team member pre-
pares a resume. When everyone’s resume is com-
plete, review each other’s resume and check off items
on the form, as you believe they have been accom-
plished, satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily. Here is an

about the company, neither you nor the staff can find
any information. Using the information in this chapter
and other information that may be provided,what can
you do next to become informed about the company?
3. Decision making. You have received two job offers.
One is from a small metal-building manufacturer
who employs a total of a hundred employees with
only one fabrication facility. The second offer is
from a national insurance company with thousands
of employees and regional offices covering the
United States. The smaller of the two companies of-
fers a starting salary that is $1,000 per year more
than the national insurance company, but it has no
retirement or profit-sharing plan. The larger com-
pany offers $1,000 less in direct compensation but
provides a liberal benefits package that includes sick
leave, profit sharing, and retirement plans. As you
consider these two options, consider the following
questions:
a. Compare the companies to determine which
one offers the greatest potential
opportunities for personal and professional
growth, the greatest monetary gain, and the
best benefits package.
b. Are you looking for immediate financial gain
with limited career growth?
c. Are you looking for possible long-term financial
gain with possible long-term security?
4. Identifying unacceptable features in resumes. You
have been an administrative assistant for three years.
Because the company is rapidly growing, three new
office support positions have been created in your
department. Your manager asked you to review the
resumes that applicants have sent. After reviewing
the resumes, you find that only five of twenty-five re-
sumes look acceptable. List items or features that
would be unacceptable in a resume.

rganizing work and managing resources are essential for measurable ac-
complishments day after day, year after year, throughout a lifetime, regard-
less of the goals a person endeavors to reach. There are five basic workplace
skills that are necessary to be successful in the workplace. Those skills include
resources, which involve identifying, organizing, planning, and allocating re-
sources. Examples of resources are workplace facilities, material, people, and time.
To manage your resources, you must demonstrate self-management. This chapter
focuses on managing resources applying the concept of self-management, which
requires you to cultivate attitudes and traits that will contribute to your success.
This chapter identifies tools and techniques that should help you to become a more
effective administrative assistant.
Time Management
Quality Approach
Through globalization, new markets continue to open both in the United States
and abroad.To remain competitive in this global marketplace, many organizations
have adopted a sound and effective approach for achieving success. It is funda-
mental and practiced through four basic principles:
• customer focus;
• continuous improvement and learning;
• strategic planning and leadership;
• teamwork.
Companies that adopt quality programs not only plan for strategic business im-
provement but also encourage learning and new leadership ideas from their em-
ployees.As authors Stephen Robbins and David DeCenzo note in Supervision Today
(2007),“The foundation of continuous improvement is built on the participation of
the people closest to the work” (p. 47).
As an office professional in an organization that embraces this approach to
business, you are likely to become a member of a problem-solving team, or a team
working to improve a business process somewhere in the organization. Most
certainly you will be empowered to make broader decisions within your sphere
of work.
WHAT IS TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT?
The quality approach—making the customer the number one priority—does not,
at first glance, seem to be significantly different from other customer-focused
strategies. However, an all-out quality commitment requires companies to elimi-
nate wasteful practices, redesign business methods, and adopt a focused approach
to managing day-to-day business.
Total Quality Management (TQM) is not new. In the late 1940s, Dr. W.
Edwards Deming, an internationally renowned statistician and consultant, took
his revolutionary management philosophy to Japan, where it became pivotal to
that nation’s successful economic recovery after World War II. Inspired by Japan’s
initial success, businesses worldwide have adopted Deming’s management tech-
niques in order to survive in the new marketplace. According to Dr. Deming,“The
consumer is the most important part of the production line. Quality should be
aimed at the needs of the consumer, present and future.”
140

Time Management
This statement forms the main principle of all quality initiatives. In simple
economic terms, we are all either producers or consumers, or both. Relating to the
main principle is not difficult, but implementing it will be one of the challenges
you face as an office professional.
HOW DO QUALITY ORGANIZATIONS WORK?
There is no single formula that works for every organization; fundamentally,however,
TQM makes all employees responsible for strengthening the competitive position of
their company by improving its products and services. Making the best use of labor
(your work), materials, and time, is seen as the key to the success of the Total Quality
approach. Anything less simply increases the expense to the customer; inevitably, this
results in loss of market share, profits, jobs, and ultimately the business itself.
The organization’s suppliers of products also need to be aware of the quality
approach. It should no longer be acceptable to deal with suppliers that are unreli-
able or provide shoddy products or services. Depending on your responsibilities,
you may wish to review your list of suppliers and develop an alliance with only
one supplier for the benefit of cost, reliability, and quality.
In the office, quality means that each employee is involved with office teamwork
and focused on customer (internal and external) satisfaction. Employees at every
level are encouraged to find new and innovative ways of doing their jobs more
effectively and to be flexible enough to assist others. You may be empowered—that
is, given more autonomy and broader responsibilities—with the goal of simplifying
office operations. You will be given responsibility for making decisions that affect
your own effectiveness and performance.
You will be judged on your team contribution and on your innovation: If the
filing system does not correspond to the operation—change it! If your colleague is
having difficulty completing a project—help out! If a customer has a complaint—
resolve it!
As an example, the administrative assistant may be invited to become part of
a team that reviews the problem of products that aren’t being delivered to the cus-
tomer on time. The team would comprise employees who are directly involved in
the delivery process under review. All members of the team have equal responsi-
bility and an equal voice in identifying all the steps and problems involved in the
delivery cycle.
The problem must be clearly understood and stated in written form. All the is-
sues that team members consider important are recorded. Team members then pri-
oritize (by vote) the stated problems. The problem that is deemed the most
significant is the first one the team deals with.
The first-priority problem is then thoroughly examined. Each step of the current
procedure is analyzed for its effectiveness and necessity. The process of examining
the entire procedure will inspire improvements. Additionally, each member will feel
he or she has contributed to a solution for improving customer satisfaction.
This team problem-solving approach is typical of process improvement activ-
ity that organizations are conducting as part of their quality approach. Let’s review
a sequence of events that might occur as a cross-functional team is formed to
address a late-delivery problem:
1. A team of employees directly involved in the order and delivery process is
formed. This team may include the administrative assistant.
2. A team leader is selected to chair the meeting.
141

Time Management
3. All input is documented by a designated recorder.
4. A facilitator may be involved to organize the team members’ input.
5. The general problem is clearly defined during the first team meeting.
6. Each team member has an equal opportunity to state what he or she believes
to be the contributing factors to the general problem. This step, which allows
the employees the freedom of open suggestion without criticism, is known
as brainstorming. In this case, examples of contributing factors to the general
problem may be
a. the person who places the orders is often away from work.
b. when the orders are placed, the suppliers do not have ready stock; they
must get stock from other markets, including foreign markets.
c. when suppliers deliver stock, it is sometimes in damaged condition, and
therefore must be reordered.
7. The team members now vote on what they believe to be the most important
specific problems (contributing factors). In this case, the most significant
factor may be that the stock is often received in poor condition and must be
reordered.
8. Next, each team member helps outline the exact steps that take place in the
process. In the case of goods arriving in damaged condition, it may be dis-
covered that the suppliers are not packing the goods carefully enough.
9. As the process is completely identified, team members provide input about
possible changes until an improved process is developed. In this case, em-
ployees might suggest that proper packing and careful handing goods would
expedite the delivery of the product to the customer.
10. The team will now make a delivery process improvement recommendation to
management.
It should be noted there are no set rules for Total Quality Management; its
application is broad and varied. But underlying all quality approaches are the
four principles.
Effectiveness and Efficiency
For the office professional, being effective and efficient are equally important.
However, these two qualities are often confused with each other. These terms,
although interrelated, are separate and distinct. Effectiveness is often defined as
doing the right things and efficiency as doing things right.

The need for efficiency has a profound effect on the level of effectiveness. Why is that?
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?
Effectiveness means producing a definite or desired result. For example, an effective
professional completes the right task correctly. Efficiency means producing the de-
sired result with a minimum of effort, expense, and waste. Although it is possible
to be effective without being efficient, the cost of inefficiency is usually too great
for profit-making organizations; they must combine efficiency with effectiveness.
Whether office professionals work for one manager or for more than one, they
must always do three things to organize their work so they can perform efficiently:
• Divide large projects into manageable segments of work.
• Group related isolated tasks to reduce the time consumed in changing from one
unrelated task to another.
• Match the work to the time frame in which it must be performed by classifying
it as work that must be done today, work that must be done this week, or work
that has no specific deadline.
Time management is defined as organizing and sequencing tasks so they are
accomplished in an efficient manner. It involves
• developing work habits that result in maximum efficiency;
• acquiring knowledge and skills to extend performance beyond present capabilities;
• controlling attitudes and emotions that have a tendency to steal time.
Work habits and effective reminder methods are discussed here.
Time Management Tools and Strategies
The need for effective time management tools and strategies becomes clear when
office professionals answer the following questions:
• Do I ever seem to get everything done that I had hoped to accomplish?
• Is my desk cluttered with papers that I am constantly reshuffling but never
processing?
• Do I often work overtime at the office? Do I often take work home to complete?
• Am I continually being interrupted by telephone calls, visitors, and others who
monopolize my time or co-workers who want to socialize?
• By failing to set priorities, do I spend most of my time on trivial details without
enough time remaining to work on the important jobs?
Office professionals who answer “yes” to all or most of these questions prob-
ably spend a lot of time on tasks that produce only minimal benefits.
143

Time Management
ESTABLISH EFFICIENT WORK HABITS
You can boost your own morale by increasing your organizational skills and by
managing your time and working efficiently.
Be a self-starter; that is, take the initiative to begin a task for which you are re-
sponsible. Don’t wait for your supervisor to prompt you. You also need to be a fin-
isher. If you have many tasks started and none finished, your workload will seem
heavier than it actually is. As you face a load of unfinished tasks, you may become
less efficient. If you fall behind in your work and you can’t catch up during regular
hours, work overtime (if allowed).As you lighten your load by completing unfinished
tasks, you will feel more relaxed and find it easier to cope and be effective.
It’s much easier to complete your work if you have an exemplary attendance
record, arrive on time each day, keep focused while at work, and put in the full
expected hours.
An administrative assistant often works under the pressure of juggling priori-
ties. One of the most difficult parts of your job will be learning how to judge these
priorities. You will have to learn what degree of importance to place on each task
and when to shift quickly to another task and apply extra effort.
Timing is an important factor in efficiency; a job must be performed not only
well but also at the right time. To make time for urgent priorities and to feel that
you are in control of your job, work willingly and with enthusiasm.
TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR TIME
There is no single “right way” for managing time on the job. The rules are often
job specific and change from organization to organization. Exactly what consti-
tutes successful time management is hard to define without using specific exam-
ples from the workplace.
Effective employees establish efficient work patterns, but no two employees
necessarily follow the same pattern. Nevertheless, the ideas presented in this chap-
ter can be used as a guide to establish your own work habits and time manage-
ment techniques.
It is important to remember this is only a guide. You will have to work hard
and think about how best to adapt these tools and strategies to your own situa-
tion. For example, balancing family responsibilities and work responsibilities is a
significant challenge to many office professionals. Organizations are developing
employee-friendly policies and support systems that provide flexible work sched-
ules and permit more work-at-home and telecommuting options.
In a type of schedule redesign known as flextime, employees work a set num-
ber of hours each day but vary the starting and ending times. Flextime allows
management to relax some of the traditional “time clock” control of employees’
time. Similarly, working from home and telecommuting present an extraordinary
opportunity to manage your own work, time, and other resources.
Finally, time management involves self-management. To manage your re-
sources (time, tasks, materials, and people), you must be able to practice self-
management. Self-management means you focus on achieving specified goals and
objectives by a given deadline and in order of priority.
LEARN THE JOB
The organization expresses its objectives—the tasks to be accomplished—in terms
of long-range, intermediate, and short-range goals. Management focuses its
attention on achieving organizational objectives by accomplishing those goals.

In any given week, your manager or supervisor will devote time to both dealing
with the work at hand and addressing longer-range goals.As you join this dynamic
environment, be as flexible, adaptable, and tolerant as you can in order to provide
real value-added assistance.
In a new job, you must understand how your manager works. Organize your
day’s work so that it coincides with that of your manager; do not expect your man-
ager to adjust to your work schedule. At first you should concentrate on learning
what is expected of you before taking initiative.
Before you can organize work, you must know what the position or job en-
tails. In most cases, someone will explain your new position and duties to you.This
might be the office assistant you are replacing, an administrative assistant in your
department, a mentor, an office manager, or your manager. During
this orientation, you should
• listen;
• take notes;
• ask questions that will increase your understanding of what is be-
ing explained and be alert to what are considered priority items;
• learn your manager’s preferences;
• write down the names of people you meet, note their depart-
ment, and learn quickly what they do (Figure 1).
Every day make an effort to learn more about your job and effi-
cient ways to perform the tasks to be done. Learn the job not just
for the current week and the next but also for three months to a
year in advance. Become familiar with the information in your of-
fice. For instance:
• Carefully study all the instructions left for you by the previous
office professional.
• Check on the different kinds of stationery and forms in your
desk or office supply cabinet and determine when each is to be
used.
• Read instruction sheets that have been prepared for certain tasks
you are to perform.
FIGURE 1 • Office assistant taking notes.

145

Time Management
• Find out what is in the active files.
• Study the organization of electronic folders either in the word processing direc-
tory or in the electronic mail system.
• Refer to the organization directory or chart to learn the names of the executives
and other employees and their titles.
When you report to work, the former employee may not be available to train
you. You may not find a procedures or desk manual describing your duties or
tasks. In this situation, your manager may be able to direct you. However, if your
manager cannot help you with the procedures, you must rely heavily on your
resourcefulness and judgment in finding answers. Keep in mind you cannot per-
form at maximum value to the organization until you fully understand the scope
and responsibilities of your position.
TAKE TIME TO THINK
After working overtime the evening before, you arrive at work early the next
morning to try to get a head start on some of your priorities. Instead, you find an
urgent request left on the seat of your chair, messages on adhesive notes stuck to
the screen of your computer, your telephone message light is blinking and, before
you can put your lunch away, your telephone is ringing. The day is just beginning
and already you feel stressed.
With this level of pressure, responsibility, and expectations, how can adminis-
trative assistants find the time and the right environment to think clearly? We often
underestimate the importance of taking time to think, but without clear thinking,
office professionals cannot improve office procedures, streamline office policies, or
provide creative solutions to problems. Improving procedures, streamlining poli-
cies, and being creative about solving problems are as much the responsibility of
the administrative assistant as they are of the manager.
Finding the Time
So just how do you find the time for creative thinking and planning? You could
ask yourself the same question about where you will find the time to answer the
telephone or reply to e-mails. Solving problems and making improvements should
be as much a part of your job as answering the telephone. So schedule the time
into your working day.
Creating the Environment
Solving problems and developing better procedures are often done best as a team.
When you have a definite problem or procedure that needs attention, call an in-
formal brainstorming session with people who are involved in the problem. If you
need to think through a problem or procedure on your own, put the telephone on
hold and ask a co-worker to cover your desk for the next fifteen minutes or half-
hour while you move to a place void of interruption. If this is impossible, do your
creative thinking on a scheduled break or early before others arrive. It’s your job
to think.
ASSIGN PRIORITIES
Setting priorities is the most difficult part of organizing your work and assigning
your time. Although you are guided by general policies about priorities, you need
to make judgments concerning performing the work in the most beneficial way for
146

Time Management
your manager and for the organization. Performing the work in the order in which
it is submitted to you is not always feasible because some tasks have more press-
ing deadlines than others. An example of a low-priority item is a memorandum
written only as a matter of record. It can be keyboarded and filed at any time.
Some time management consultants suggest assigning priorities to work tasks
in four categories:
1. (1 or A). Must be done immediately; cannot be delayed
2. (2 or B). Must be done today
3. (3 or C). Less important—may be done as soon as time allows, perhaps the
following week, if necessary
4. (4 or D). Least important—may be completed within the next week or two, if
necessary
As time passes, tasks that are in category 4 will move to categories 3 and 2. Other
consultants suggest three categories. What is important is that you establish your
categories with your manager.
If you are unsure how to determine priorities, ask yourself the following ques-
tions about each task:
• Is this task or project a priority of my immediate supervisor or manager?
• Is this work needed immediately? Is this a daily task or a long-range task?
• How much time is required to complete this task?
• Are others involved in the completion of this task?
• Is there a specific deadline for this task?
You can determine the order of priorities in at least four ways:
1. Ask questions of those involved in the process.
2. Study documentation, such as the office manual.
3. Listen to your manager’s requests to determine a “pattern.”
4. Keep a record of how work flows in and out of the office.
For example, know when routine reports are due and how much in advance
to request work from other departments, learn mail pickup and postal schedules,
and be aware of the most convenient times to reach executives by telephone.
WORK WITH MULTIPLE MANAGERS
The demands of managers and others for whom you work will be the overriding
factor in how you divide your time. When you are working for two managers, one
may have lots of work for you and the other very little. Or perhaps you work for
a group of salespeople who are out of the office much of the time; each one may
have very little work for you, but every salesperson expects you to do it on the day
he or she returns to the office. Under this arrangement, you can prepare a sched-
ule a week in advance showing who will be in the office on which days of the week.
This information may not be easy to obtain, but it will be helpful when it comes
to answering the telephone and anticipating your own workload.
Over time you will learn how much time you need to devote to performing
each person’s work. For your own use, keep a record of how you spend your time.

FIGURE 2 • Time distribution chart.
Prepare a time distribution chart, as shown in Figure 2.The time distribution chart
is designed to show how work and time are allocated for several workers per-
forming related office tasks; however, with minor changes it can be used to show
the distribution of time and duties performed by one worker for several others. To
complete the chart, follow these steps:
1. At the top of the columns,write the names of those for whom you perform work.
2. Enter the time used and a brief description of the task performed in the
columns below the names.
3. After keeping the charts for several weeks, total the time used on behalf of
each person and compute percentages.
After reviewing your results, answer the following questions:
• Were there any surprises? What was the biggest surprise?
• How many of the tasks you performed were planned?
• How much of what you did was unplanned?
Your analysis will give you some estimate of how much work to expect from
each person, and it may suggest what you are doing that could be channeled else-
where. When you have so much work to be done that some of it must be reas-
signed, your chart will be especially helpful to you and your manager in deciding
which duties or activities might be handled by someone else.
148

Time Management
Most office professionals who work for groups comprising employees of dif-
ferent ranks give highest priority to the work of the top-ranked person in the group,
second priority to the next in rank, and so on.This arrangement may ensure a good
relationship with your manager, but it may also create problems, particularly if
some employees at the lower ranks feel they can never get their work done on time
or at all. Eventually they will complain. Avoid this situation by learning how to as-
sess the urgency of the work of the senior managers or supervisors in the group.
You will discover some of their work can wait. Make your own judgment without
discussing it with others and proceed with completing the tasks. However, when
your work is backed up to the extent it must be discussed formally, the most senior
manager has the responsibility of assessing the total workload and determining the
need for additional help.
Some employees, in an effort to gain priority for their requests, label all re-
quests ASAP (as soon as possible) or Rush. In each case you must judge what is
“rush” and what is not. When you sense these employees are under a lot of pres-
sure, you might occasionally prevent a disruption by giving priority to their work;
however, this practice must not become the norm. By giving priority to managers
who mark all items Rush, you are encouraging this behavior at the expense of
other managers’ work. Those managers who decrease stress in the office by prac-
ticing effective time management should not be penalized. Dealing with this issue
requires diplomacy. The best advice is to collect facts before you approach the
problem. For example:
• How many rush items are you receiving?
• Which managers are giving you the rush items?
• What are the rush items?
• On what dates are you being given the rush items?
• When are the deadlines?
The time distribution chart will assist with collection of this information.
You can maintain more control over your work schedule by relying on your
own judgment about the order in which work should be done, instead of trying to
follow rigid rules. Your judgment must be good, and you need to be as concerned
about your rapport with the members of the group as you are about the quality of
the work you perform.
Some office professionals aspire to work for only one manager. Advantages
and disadvantages to such a situation include the following:
Advantages of Working with Only One Manager
1. You are often viewed as having more status within the company.
2. You do not have to adjust to conflicting management styles.
3. Your manager has a clearer idea of your time constraints. Where several man-
agers share the same office professional, the managers often are not aware of

Disadvantages of Working with Only One Manager
1. Your responsibilities may be routine. When an office professional works for
more than one manager, the worker often receives a greater variety of projects
to complete. Remember, the more experience you receive, the more marketable
you become.

Time Management
2. An office professional working for only one manager gains business contacts
from only that source. If you work for a number of managers, your chances
of networking are improved; this, of course, could improve your future em-
ployment opportunities.
3. Working for only one manager may not allow you to practice your organiza-
tional skills to the same degree that working for multiple managers would.
The preference is a personal one. Both positions may require equal challenges. If
the challenges do not present themselves, find them!
ADOPT A FLEXIBLE PLAN
Management consultants recommend planning work and then following the plan.
This is good advice; however, planning may present disadvantages. Consider these
issues:
• Planning may create rigidity.
• Plans are difficult to create in a dynamic environment, one in which the envi-
ronment changes frequently.
• Plans tend to focus on what works today and not how to deal with the issues of
tomorrow.
In the end, you must plan for the ideal distribution of your time, but your plan
must be flexible. Use your plan as an overall guide, but do not become discouraged
when you cannot follow it closely. Your reputation for being flexible, adaptable,
and tolerant with your plan will serve you well for the rest of your career.
One of your major responsibilities is to save your manager time. To accom-
plish this,
• perform as much of your manager’s work as you can. For example, ask which
telephone calls or e-mail messages you can handle.
• decrease interruptions or at least schedule them. Keep a list of questions you
may have or someone else has and present them at a scheduled moment or dur-
ing a particular block of time that is convenient for your manager.
• collect and verify facts and assemble materials he or she will need to perform
the task.
To enable your manager to perform with maximum efficiency, tackle the most
pressing or important job first and keep adjusting your plan so you can meet the
corresponding deadlines.
You must recognize your work schedule is not truly your own. Your work
schedule is governed not only by your manager’s objectives and deadlines but also
by the inherent schedule of the organization’s information. For example:
• You may plan to devote the morning hours to starting a lengthy assignment only
to discover your manager wants you to process a new expense summary in or-
der to meet a scheduled payroll run.
• A telephone call from the corporate home office requesting critical information
may take precedence over everything else.
• The deadline for sending the department’s weekly and monthly revenue report
is based on a routine and defined schedule.
• Whenever an interrelated department with which you work changes its schedule,
you may have to adjust your schedule to accommodate that department.

Time Management
MANAGE DETAILS
Keep an ongoing list of the tasks you have grouped and add miscellaneous items
by completing a daily to-do list. This list must be updated daily, preferably at the
end of the day. To keep your to-do list current, use Microsoft® Word or Outlook.
If you prefer, write your to-do list in a notebook or create a form.
Figure 3 shows a sample format for a daily plan or to-do list. Numbering or
ranking priorities according to the 1, 2, 3, or 4 categories discussed earlier will help
you to constantly update and reassess your list.
Like every other office professional, you will be faced with the problem of
keeping up with a myriad of details. In fact, you will be forced to devise methods
for managing them. Not only must you record these details immediately, but you
also must put them in a form that will enable you to locate and use them later.
To capture details, use spiral-bound notebooks, notepads, or your computer to
help you manage details and reminders. The advantage of an electronic format is
that the detail is easily changed or modified and that its distribution to other staff
is simple (see Figure 4). Forms bring related information together in one place and
prompt the user to record all the essential facts. For example, a Gantt chart, named
for Gantt, a pioneer of project management techniques, provides graphical visual-
ization of a project that displays each task as a horizontal bar. The primary pur-
pose of the Gantt chart is to graphically display project schedule information by
listing project tasks and their corresponding start and finish date in a calendar
format.
Recording facts as soon as they become available to you is an important aspect
of managing details.You will discover the practice of“do it now”is in conflict with
the concept of grouping tasks to save time and energy; nevertheless, you need to
capture details at the precise moment they arise in order to keep up with them.
Actually, the means you devise for keeping up with details can vary from task
to task according to the work involved and your personal preferences. That being
said, recognize in all your work
• the importance of having some method for capturing details;
• the need to be consistent in following your method.
You can use check marks, initials, codes, and symbols to indicate the status of
each detail you want to capture. For instance:
• The date stamp you place on a piece of incoming mail tells you have already
seen it.
• The check mark by the enclosure notation on the file copy of a letter reminds
you that you did include the enclosure.
• The electronic date and time notation attached to a computer file (located under
File, Properties) indicates when the file was last modified.
In addition, if you are consistent in using each type of notation to convey its re-
spective meaning, the absence of an appropriate notation will alert you to give at-
tention to that item.
When you encounter a new task, spend a little time deciding how you are going
to keep up with the details and then be consistent in doing so.
Details arranged in the chronological order in which they were originally
recorded usually are not in their most usable form. Details must be arranged so
they can be located quickly. The organization can range from indexing on cards to
computer information search tools.

Organizing the details you need to keep, such as the names of new contacts,
telephone numbers, changes of address, and schedule changes, can be done with
great efficiency with a computer because you need to record it only once. Not every-
thing you write down needs to be transferred; this is especially true of reminders of
things to do or other temporary items. Cross out the reminders as you complete the
tasks, but go over your list carefully and transfer the reminders of tasks yet to be
done to your to-do list for the following day.You may also want to transfer detailed
instructions you have in your notebook and place them in your office manual.
As more managers become familiar with their personal digital assistants
(PDAs), some office professionals are giving up traditional personal organizer
notebooks in favor of a palm-sized personal digital assistant, such as a Palm. The
PDAs retain the essential phone book, calendar, memo pad, and to-do lists. The
wireless models enable you to access the Internet to send and receive electronic
mail. Having a computer backup of your calendar, action list, and names and tele-
phone numbers is a lifesaver. If you lose or misplace your traditional personal or-
ganizer notebook, you’ve lost it all.
GROUP SIMILAR TASKS
You can save time and energy by not shifting from one task to another. For example,
replenish your office supplies once a week or less often. Avoid making a trip to the
supply area every day. If supplies are delivered to you, complete one requisition for
all the supplies you will need for several weeks.
Different work requires different degrees of concentration and, in turn, a
different pace. Therefore, to control your pace, group the tasks that require the
same degree of concentration. Letters to confirm information and to make routine

requests are favorable in tone, usually short, and easy to write. Group these letters
and compose them rapidly; then use a slower pace to compose a letter requiring a
long explanation that may require input from your manager.
In addition, group tasks to increase effectiveness. For instance, making a tele-
phone call should not be a routine task to be sandwiched between other assignments
in an offhand way.A telephone call conveys an impression of the organization to the
receiver. By grouping your telephone calls, you can give them your complete atten-
tion and project your personality in a thoughtful, businesslike manner.
WORK AT ONE TASK AT A TIME
Schedule your work so you can keep at one task until you finish it or until you come
to a logical stopping place, such as a new subheading. If a stopping place does
not exist, try to work at one task at the very least, one hour or longer—even if you
have interruptions. Jumping from one task to another is confusing. Furthermore,
reviewing work to figure out where to begin and recalling what has and has not
been done results in wasted time and energy. You will be rewarded threefold when
you stay with a task until it is completed:
• You will be motivated by the satisfaction of having finished the task.
• You will save time you otherwise would lose locating where you left off.
• You will decrease the risk of forgetting to perform a part of the task.
As you work, thoughts about other tasks will flash across your mind. Write
down each usable thought on your to-do list and continue to concentrate on the
work at hand. Learn how to handle interruptions and shift back quickly to the im-
mediate task; coping with interruptions is discussed later in this chapter.
Form the habit of working at an uncluttered desk. On the immediate work
area of your desk, place only the materials you need for the task on which you are
working. Because you can give attention to only one main task at a time, put the
other work aside, carefully organized and labeled. Stacking work on top of work
in a disorganized way leads to confusion; it is how papers get lost and nerves be-
come frayed. The time you spend organizing work in progress will not be wasted.
When you put aside everything except the task on which you are working, you will
feel more relaxed and be able to focus it. Additional discussion about your work-
station is provided later in this chapter.

Time Management
START THE DAY WITH A DIFFICULT TASK
Begin your day in an unhurried way so you will not need the first thirty minutes
at the office to “pull yourself together.” If you commute and frequently worry
about your bus or other transportation being late, try to improve your day by tak-
ing an earlier bus (or train or subway). If you drive, allow an extra five or ten min-
utes to get a head start on the morning traffic rush.Arrive early, go over your plans
for the day (which you prepared the day before), and then tackle a task that re-
quires concentration and effort on your part. Tackle either a task that is difficult
or one that you dislike. It will seem easier when you are more energetic and your
mind is clear.
Make the first hour one of accomplishment, not one in which you simply get
ready to work. Perhaps your first tasks will be to listen to the voice mail, take mes-
sages and direct them to the person who is to receive them, and read your elec-
tronic mail. As soon as you finish these regular duties, start a challenging task. Of
course, there will be times when you use the first hour to complete unfinished work
from the day before.
Some workers claim they perform best early in the day, others, in the after-
noon, and still others say they concentrate best very late in the day. Psychologists
have confirmed that every person has his or her own preferred work cycle. If you
consider yourself an afternoon performer, use your afternoon hours for your most
creative and challenging work, but force yourself to make the first hour a brisk
one. Workers who waste time getting started are putting themselves under unnec-
essary pressure to accomplish their work in what remains of the day. At any rate,
do not use the beginning of the day to perform those easy tasks that can provide
relaxation at intervals during the day.
AVOID PROCRASTINATION
Procrastination is an unproductive behavior pattern that causes you to delay
working on your most important assignments and to focus on tasks that aren’t pri-
orities. We all procrastinate to some degree at certain times, but to some people it
is a habit. To break the habit of procrastination, you must first gain an under-
standing of your behavior and then work to overcome it. You can gain a better
understanding of this behavior by taking these steps:
1. Admit that you are procrastinating.
2. Ask yourself what type of projects or tasks causes you to procrastinate.
Some office workers might see a major project as a horrendous task, whereas
others might find daily routine tasks too much to face.
3. Ask yourself why you avoid these projects or tasks.Are you bored with the rou-
tine or afraid of the challenge? Are you avoiding interaction with certain office
workers or authority figures? Do you fear failing at greater responsibility?
After answering these questions, you will be better prepared to overcome this un-
productive behavior. The following tips will help you avoid procrastination and
become more productive:
1. Ask yourself what is the worst thing that can happen while you perform this
task. Once you think it through, you will find that the risk created by the proj-
ect or task is not that great; in fact, the benefits of completing the project or
individual tasks will far outweigh the difficulties.
155

Time Management
2. If the project is large, divide it into smaller sections. Several small tasks always
appear to be easier to accomplish than one large task. For more suggestions,
refer to the “Manage a Large Project” section presented later in this chapter.
3. Reward yourself often. Allow yourself a break or a more pleasant task once
you have completed a portion of the work. Small and frequent rewards work
better for procrastinators than one large reward after completion of a very
strenuous task.
4. Ask yourself what is the downside of not completing the task on time—or
worse, not completing the task at all. Does not doing the task mean the loss
of your job, a demotion, or the loss of respect from your peers and managers?
5. If you are a perfectionist, you may be avoiding a simple task because of your
working style. Remember not all work must be flawless. Working smarter
instead of harder means recognizing the difference between work that must
be perfect and work that can contain minor flaws and acting on it.
COPE WITH INTERRUPTIONS
Every challenging office job that demands a variety of duties will be punctuated
by interruptions. To avoid some interruptions:
• Practice avoidance by organizing your work area so that it is less accessible to
co-workers who wish to socialize during work hours. Try moving extra chairs
away from your desk, or moving or angling your desk so that it cannot easily
be seen by passersby. Remove the candy dish that encourages your co-workers
to drop by to grab one or two pieces and interrupt your work.
• To avoid interruptions caused by noise, relocate noisy equipment away from
your desk.
• When you are working on a project or an individual task that requires your
full attention, ask another worker to handle your telephone calls; explain the
urgency of your task to co-workers and then move to a location away from your
desk. Be careful not to overextend your requests for help as your co-workers
may grow tired of covering for you during these times.
Your success in coping with interruptions will depend on your attitude toward
them and your ability to handle them. You know that interruptions will occur—
the telephone will ring, a visitor will walk in, a co-worker will ask you a question,
your manager will need assistance. What you do not know is the precise moment
when the interruption will occur.
Recognize that interruptions are part of the job and allow time for them in
your planning. Keep a record of the number of telephone calls you receive in a typ-
ical day, the number of visitors you receive, and the number of times you assist
your manager and co-workers. Estimate the time consumed by these interruptions
and determine how much time you have left for other tasks. Do not create your
own frustrations by planning to accomplish more than you can get done. For a
review of a time distribution chart, refer to Figure 2.
Do not resent interruptions. Keep calm; do not allow yourself to become upset.
You will feel less frustrated if you know how much time you need to perform each
of your normal tasks. For example, keep a record of how long it takes to key a
two-page letter, to compose a one-page schedule, to develop a twelve-page formal
report, and to process the daily mail. This is useful information for future planning
and scheduling. If you discover you are running out of time to meet a deadline, decide
for yourself which work can be postponed. Use your time for the priority items.

When You Must Interrupt Others, Be Considerate
✓Wait until the other person is at a break in his or her work.
✓Direct your questions to the correct person, and do not interrupt
others unnecessarily.
✓Do not ask others to answer questions to which you can find the
answers by looking them up.
✓Accumulate the questions you must ask your manager; then
ask several at one time to cut down on interrupting her or him.
✓Write an electronic message enumerating your questions. This
is an excellent way to avoid a direct interruption and to obtain
a quick response.
Give adequate time to handling each interruption. Do not appear to be rushed.
Be courteous, but do not waste time because of an interruption. To reduce the time
used for each interruption, proceed in the following ways:
1. Mark your place as soon as you are interrupted—a light, erasable check mark
in the margin with a soft-lead pencil will suffice.
2. Once you are interrupted, handle the interruption immediately if it can be
dealt with in only a few minutes. If a co-worker asks for information, look it
up and supply the information while the co-worker is at your desk. In response
to a telephone call you can handle, follow through on the caller’s request, even
looking up information if you can do so without keeping the caller waiting
a noticeable length of time. However, if the interruption requires prolonged
attention, you may have to postpone action on it. Realize, however, that each
time you must postpone following through on a request, you are creating a
new item for your to-do list.
3. Quickly resume work where you left off at the time of the interruption. Do not
encourage co-workers to linger in your office. Be courteous, but do not con-
tinue a telephone conversation beyond the time necessary to handle the call.
4. Avoid interrupting yourself because of lack of planning.
5. Keep a pencil in your hand, or keep your hands on the keyboard. These
actions inform the visitor that you are eager to continue your work.
6. Do not get involved in office gossip. Small talk creates big interruptions.
7. When a co-worker drops by your office for a visit, stand up. Often a person
feels invited to sit if you are sitting. If the co-worker sits down and you feel the

need to sit, do so on the edge of your desk. This does not invite the co-worker
to become too comfortable.
8. When possible, hold meetings in another person’s office. This allows you to
leave as soon as the business is complete. Meeting with visitors in reception
areas or conference rooms helps to keep the meeting short because these areas
often do not provide the privacy of an office.
DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME
To produce acceptable work on the first try, plan each task before you begin, focus
on the exactness of the details as you perform, and then check each finished task for
correctness and completeness before you release it. Remember waste results when
work that could have been completed correctly on the first try must be redone.
Before you start performing a task, make sure you understand the instructions.
Then review the facts, visualize the work in its finished form, and make a plan.
The speed with which business information flows, especially with the advent
of computer networks, has placed a premium on accuracy. An error that has been
released is difficult to retrieve. Problems created by errors that are released into
the channels of information are not only time consuming to correct but can also
result in losses to the organization. For example, a keyboarding error in a budget
can be duplicated to other departments within an organization and go undetected
until after decisions are made to purchase new equipment. The consequence may
be some departments may not be able to purchase the equipment as planned for
in a particular quarter and may be delayed in ordering the equipment for some
later time or may be forced to delay the purchase for a year. Check your work
carefully.
Evaluate Your Workload
Most organizations provide a lunch hour and short morning and afternoon breaks
during a regular workday. With these exceptions, employees are expected to per-
form efficiently and effectively through the day.
To maintain your best performance throughout the day and the week, experi-
ment with alternating difficult and easy tasks to establish the best combination for
conserving your energy. Observe which tasks consume a great deal of energy and
which ones seem to require little energy. Rotate tasks that require more concen-
tration and effort with tasks that require less thought and energy. Whether a task
is difficult or easy for you to perform will depend on your ability, your experience
in performing the given task, and your attitude toward it.
Performing an undesirable task requires an extra expenditure of energy. Repet-
itive tasks are often disliked because of their repetitious nature rather than for the
work itself. Fortunately, the computer and its various peripherals have introduced
new and interesting methods of accomplishing routine tasks.
Here are a few more tips to follow:
• Once you discover which tasks are easy for you, save them to perform between
difficult tasks.
• Use them to provide relaxation as you work.
• Throughout the day, alternate difficult tasks with easy ones.
158

Time Management
How to Balance Your Workload
✓Establish the duration of peak workload, how often it will occur,
and what you can do about it, if anything.
✓Determine what preparation you can make in advance to
lessen the peak workload. To avoid crises and to prepare for
the “peaks and valleys,” set your own personal deadlines a
few hours or days before others set deadlines for you
(Figure 5).
✓If there is no letup in the work,either you are not approaching your
job in an efficient way or you need assistance. Discuss the situa-
tion with your manager and be prepared to offer viable solutions.
FIGURE 5 • Administrative assistant planning workload.
• When possible, also alternate sitting with standing tasks.
• When you cannot change the task, change your pace. After lunch and after your
morning and afternoon breaks, tackle difficult tasks.
• When you are estimating the time needed for performing a long, complicated
task, allow for a decrease in production as you continue working. You cannot
expect to perform at your maximum rate for six or seven hours. Your produc-
tivity will be highest when you can keep fatigue to a minimum. Discover and
maintain a pace that will make it possible for you to do your best work.
Because of the pressure of work, you may sometime find it necessary to forgo
your morning or afternoon break and shorten your lunch hour. A particular due
date or deadline may require you to stick to the difficult task and postpone other
work. During these heavy peak work times, you may be asked to work overtime,
and others in the office may be asked to assist you.All of these pressures may make
you feel you have no control over your work schedule. When you face these situ-
ations, reevaluate your workload.

MAKE A DAILY PLAN
Many management consultants agree that if you use the last ten to twenty minutes
of your day to get organized, you will notice there is far less clutter after a week
or so. This activity can help you wind down at the end of a hectic day and ease
your transition from work to home.
At the end of the day, review the work you must do the next day. Estimate the
time each of your tasks will take and fit them one by one into time slots. Go
through the same steps daily, and then leave your office with the satisfaction of
knowing your work is well organized for the next day. To prepare a systematic
daily plan, you could proceed as follows:
1. Whether you use an electronic calendar or a desk calendar pad, make sure that
the appointment entries in your manager’s calendar and yours are identical.
2. Go over your to-do list. Refer to Figure 3 as an example of a form. If some-
thing on the list must be carried out the following day, enter it in your to-do
list. As you are planning your work, you will think of tasks that must be done
sometime later. Put notes about these on your to-do list.
3. Locate the reports, correspondence, and other items to which you know your
manager will need to refer during meetings or conferences or before he or she
places a telephone call, writes a report, or carries out other responsibilities.
Flag these with colored stickers so you can retrieve them quickly the follow-
ing day. Likewise, locate the information you will need in order to proceed
with your own work.
4. Complete your paper filing and lock the files. As a part of your filing routine,
transfer copies of completed work and the related data from your work-in-
progress folder to the file.
5. Clear your desk, putting everything in place.
The next morning, review the entries in your daily appointment calendar and
your to-do list. By using this system, you will be well prepared to start your work
immediately. You will enjoy the satisfaction of having a plan for your tasks and
priorities.
PLAN ASSIGNMENTS IN ADVANCE
With the exception of routine duties, office work requires planning. The amount
of planning time needed depends on how complicated the job is, how long it takes,
and whether or not the person doing the work has ever performed similar tasks.
Executives in successful organizations plan three to five years in advance.
Managers at all levels plan at least one year in advance. Observe how your man-
ager and others in your organization think ahead, and then apply some of their
techniques to your own assignments. The time you spend thinking through what
needs to be done will save you minutes and hours of redoing work.
Take time to study a job until you can visualize it to its completion, regardless
of how complicated or lengthy it is. People who work aimlessly seldom reach the
goals toward which they should have been working. If necessary, ask yourself and
others what the expected outcome of the specific assignment is. Do not hesitate to
ask about the purpose of an assignment. When an assignment is new to you, you
may find it difficult, if not impossible, to visualize it to its completion. If necessary,
ask your manager to guide you. As you learned in Chapter 1, your contribution to
the organization is through the assignments you complete that help the organiza-
tion achieve its goals.
160

Time Management
Don’t let thoughts of complicated tasks and deadlines interfere with getting to-
day’s work finished. Do one job at a time. Schedule “thinking” time in the same way
you schedule time for word processing. Start by writing down your thoughts at ran-
dom. Organize them later.As you study the job, estimate the time needed to complete
each part of it.Start with the completion date and work backward to the current date.
The most critical parts of an assignment are the ones that require other peo-
ple, either to supply information or to perform certain tasks. Begin your prepara-
tion with the segments of the work that involves others.
Assume you are compiling data for a report. Make a checklist of your needs.
For instance, will you need special information or materials, such as the most re-
cent figures from the accounting department, a comparative analysis from the data
center, photographs to be taken by the audiovisual department, charts that must
be reduced in size by the printing department, or the public relations department’s
approval for the illustrations to be included in the report? Make each of these re-
quests as soon as you are certain of your needs.
As you prepare an assignment in advance, plan it so carefully that you can put
it aside and not think about it until you are ready to start it. This is important be-
cause thinking about an endless stream of work has a negative effect on perfor-
mance. Label a folder for the assignment and put everything pertaining to it in that
folder. Plan your time.Allow some time for delays. Keep careful notes on what you
have and have not done. Once you actually start performing the assignment, make
a daily check of the work completed against the projected time schedule.
Review the Gantt chart in Figure 4. This chart is an excellent tool for comparing
your planned work schedule against the actual time required to complete a task.
MANAGE A LARGE PROJECT
When you start a large project, you will need to allocate some time each day for
planning and controlling. The following suggestions should help you manage a
large project.
1. Determine the desired goal. Know exactly what you are to accomplish. Being
unsure about the goal is a real time waster.
2. Write down the target date.
3. Divide the project into manageable segments and then, as far as it is possible
to do so, work with one segment at a time.
4. Set completion dates for each segment; as you progress, check the dates to en-
sure you are on schedule.
5. Check for the supplies you will need; have a few extras on hand of those that
are quickly used.
6. Delegate some of your regular duties, if needed, to make time for working on
the project.
7. If you will need the services of others, either within or outside the organiza-
tion, contact them at the planning stage of the project to find out about sched-
uling. Determine what you will have to do to meet their schedules.
8. Determine what data you will need, how to obtain it, and when.
9. As soon as you begin the project, make detailed notes in an electronic docu-
ment or a large bound notebook.
10. Divide the document into subdocuments or divide the notebook into seg-
ments, matching the segments of the project.

Office Organization
By organizing office supplies and the workstation, an office professional can save
a great deal of time and save the company money. Following are suggestions for
organizing the office supplies and your workstation.
ORGANIZE THE OFFICE SUPPLIES
1. Label the shelves where supplies are kept. This way other workers who use
the supplies will know where to look without interrupting you. This proce-
dure also helps you keep track of supplies on hand.
2. Make sure one person is responsible for controlling inventory and ordering sup-
plies. This is a task that you or a senior office professional will often delegate.
3. Develop your own requisition form, if necessary. Keep these forms in the sup-
ply area. Staff will be expected to complete the form if they notice a product
is running low. Be sure the form has room for a full description. Encourage
11. As you plan for each segment or part of a segment, list everything that must
be done. Keep adding to your list at random.
12. As you complete each item, mark an X or draw a line through it. Circle in a
different color the items still to be done. Do this carefully because the most
helpful part of your notes will be the notations about unfinished items.
13. When you have completed an entire segment, write Completed at the top of
the corresponding page in your document, file, or notebook.
14. When you make a change, be sure to make it everywhere the change occurs.
15. Separate the in-progress segments so you can add to them or reorganize them
with ease.
16. Carefully recheck all the circled items to be sure nothing has been left undone.
Creating a detailed project plan and keeping it up to date for most nontrivial proj-
ects can be a time-consuming process if completed manually. Today, thanks to the
use of the computer, automated solutions enable everyone to benefit from using
project management methods, such as the one provided by Microsoft® Project, an
application software.

the staff to fill in as much information as possible (descriptions, quantities,
colors, sizes, and so on). This will simplify your work when it comes to com-
pleting the requisition for ordering. In most organizations, the form will be in
an electronic format.
4. Compose a list of all items you use on a regular basis. Include the item unit
numbers, unit prices, descriptions, colors available, and so on. Post this list in
the supply area along with a stack of the requisition forms, which is necessary
if you expect staff members to partially complete the requisition forms.
5. Discourage staff members from placing verbal orders with you. This type of
interruption can be time consuming: You must stop your work, listen to the
request, write down the information, check the supplies, and perhaps get back
to the staff members for further clarification.
6. When staff members have rush orders, request they either send you an e-mail
request or complete a requisition, and send it to you electronically.
7. Before placing an order, compare prices between the office supply catalogs
and advertisements sent to you. Be sure you know your company’s procedures
for placing orders. Follow designated procedures with accuracy as you will
save time and money by getting the order right the first time.
8. Do not over-order supplies, unless you are ordering supplies in standard-
sized packages. Too many supplies will cause confusion. Because space is of-
ten at a premium, excess supplies tend to create a storage problem. As well,
some supplies have a shelf life: if not used before a certain date, they become
less useful.
9. When you place an order, be prepared with all the required information. Hav-
ing requisition forms returned or needing to make a follow-up telephone call
to clarify an order will delay delivery.
TAKE INVENTORY OF THE OFFICE SUPPLIES
As you have learned, administrative assistants should replenish their office sup-
plies during the time of day or week they are the least busy. Yet they need to plan
well enough that they are not searching for supplies when pressed for time to com-
plete a rush job; or, others aren’t needing supplies for which the administrative as-
sistant is responsible for maintaining.
Your office software can help you to keep track of supplies so your office does
not run out of critical items, keep too much stock on hand, or use outdated sup-
plies, such as printer cartridges. Using your computer will make calculating the use
rate of supplies easier and more accurate. You can create your own spreadsheet or
follow these steps to create an inventory.
1. Open the spreadsheet software and create a document called Office Supply
Inventory.
2. Type the title in the appropriate cell of the spreadsheet.
3. Create a row for each type of supply and columns across the spreadsheet to
show the following data for each month of the year.
a. The amount on hand for that month
b. The amount used since the last inventory
c. The amount that needs to be ordered
4. Create formulas in the appropriate cells to automatically calculate the amount
used and the number to be reordered.
163

Time Management
5. Count the number of each item in the supply stock and record the number in
the correct place on the spreadsheet.
6. When the counts are complete and recorded, save the file and print the spread-
sheet.
7. Use the printed spreadsheet to reorder supplies.The spreadsheet formulas will
have calculated how many of each item has been used and how many more
you need to order.
8. When new supplies arrive, stock them behind the existing supplies, which al-
lows the oldest supplies to be used first.
Administrative assistants play key roles in maintaining supplies that are
needed to complete day-to-day tasks.
ORGANIZE THE WORKSTATION
A cluttered desk gives clients, co-workers, and managers the impression that you
are disorganized. A cluttered desk is not necessarily a sign you are busy; in fact, a
cluttered desk simply adds to your workload. It is essential you purge any extra-
neous materials and then organize the materials you intend to keep.
Place Work in Easy Reach
An unorganized desk area accounts for one of the greatest time wasters in the of-
fice. Normal and maximum working areas at a desk have been established through
time and motion studies. Materials and supplies should be positioned within the
normal working area if the worker is to attain maximum efficiency. You can de-
termine the normal working area of the desk for either the right or left hand by
swinging the extended hand and forearm across the desk.
Before you begin a task at a desk or a table, place the supplies, tools, and equip-
ment you will need in the normal working area. Use the space in your desk to store
supplies, stationery, and work-in-progress. Materials should pass across the top of
your desk but should not be stored on it. Keep a minimum number of items on top
of your desk.
File all your work-in-progress in one drawer unless your manager is working
on a project that generates so much paperwork the materials have to be subdivided
into several folders. Allocate separate space in a vertical file drawer for a project
of this magnitude. Never put a single folder of pending material in an unusual
place—relocation of this material can lead to confusion and wasted time.
In case you might be absent, let your manager know where you keep impor-
tant project folders and other work-in-progress. If the work-in-progress is highly
confidential, you may have to store it in file cabinets with special locks at night.

Time Management
If you have a drawer that is not deep enough to hold file folders in a vertical
position, keep it empty. Use it as temporary storage when you want to clear your
desk to store the papers on which you are currently working—for instance, while
you sort the mail or go to lunch.
Do not use sections of your desk for permanent storage. File completed items
immediately after completing a task so you will not be searching in two places to
locate one item. Furthermore, you will need the desk space to store the data for
the new project or assignment.
Purge Unnecessary Items
One of the first steps to take in organizing your desk is to eliminate all that you
don’t need. Each time you pick up a document from your desk and wonder where
to file it, ask yourself whether there’s a law that says you must keep it. If not, con-
sider the recycling box or the garbage bin.
If any of the following applies to a document, you have just cause to purge
yourself of paper:
1. Another co-worker has filed it where you can access it if needed.
2. The document is duplication. Once you get organized, one copy is all you need
of any document.
3. The document is out of date. Newer information is usually better information.
You can always get current information from the Internet or from the reference
section of the library.
4. Chances are you will never find the time to read the information. If the infor-
mation is “nice to know” rather than essential, rid yourself of it until you are
organized.
You will find that you work much more efficiently after you have organized your
desk.
Federal privacy laws require companies to dispose of confidential information
properly so it cannot be stolen and misused. If you are disposing of records with pri-
vate information about customers or co-workers, which might include social security
numbers or account data, for instance, follow proper archival or disposal procedures.
Organize Necessary Items
Ridding your workstation of excess paper is only the first step in getting organized.
The importance of a highly organized workstation cannot be emphasized enough.
One of the most frustrating time wasters is searching for information that has
been filed incorrectly or has simply disappeared. Of course, employing the correct
filing rules is imperative. However, there is much more to organizing your work-
station. When your workstation is organized, you save valuable time.
The following suggestions will help you get started:
1. Consider how and where you want incoming work to be placed. Select a system
you can use to avoid your manager and co-workers from “dumping” materials
on your chair, under your mouse, or on your keyboard. Here is one suggestion:
• Place all the new mail and paperwork that arrive during the day in the IN
box. Once you have processed everything, invariably there are papers and
pieces of mail that need to go out; place these in the OUT box. IN and OUT
boxes should be clearly labeled and should be either wood or wire because
these boxes are the roomiest.
165

Time Management
2. If your workstation is currently in a cluttered condition, plan several uninter-
rupted breaks to attack the problem.
3. Once you have organized the workstation, take a mental snapshot of it and
vow you will never leave it disorganized at the end of the day. Start the day
with a clear mind and a clear desk. Many offices now practice a clean desk
policy, which stipulates that each evening employees must leave their desks in
either a totally clear or tidy condition.
4. If your office does not have a paper shredder, approach your manager about
purchasing one. Employees are often reluctant to discard confidential mate-
rial, so they let it accumulate in what eventually becomes a thick folder tucked
into a corner of the desk or on top of the desk. Compact shredders can be
placed on top of wastebaskets.
5. A basket placed in your workstation to hold work that is pending often be-
comes a storage bin. If you do not intend to work on a document immediately,
file it in its appropriately labeled folder. Then place the folder in the file cab-
inet and make a comment in your calendar on the day this document must be
dealt with. This way the phrase “out of sight—out of mind” will not apply.
6. Use one calendar for all your appointments. Referring to several calendars—
personal and business—is a waste of time and will result in disorganization.
7. Wherever you store information—drawers,cabinets,folders,baskets,and so on—
affix a label that describes the type of information that should be stored in this lo-
cation. While you are getting organized, you will have stacks of paper. Organize
them by placing a temporary label on top of the pile. Not only will the labels as-
sist you in locating information, but they will also assist others in your absence.
8. Attempt to follow this rule: Never handle a piece of paper more than once. At
times this rule may be unrealistic, but it will force you to make a decision
rather than procrastinate, then handle and reread a document.
9. Never use the surface of your desk as storage space. Your desk is a work area;
you need all of it available to remain organized while you conduct your work.
10. Keep your computer reference information current. If names, addresses, and
telephone numbers are indexed on your computer system, consider it a prior-
ity to update the system as often as possible. You cannot enjoy the efficiency
of using a computer system unless it provides correct information.
11. Create a reference for frequently called telephone or fax numbers. Place this
reference list nearby or code the numbers into the memory of the telephone
or fax machine.
12. Place reference books at an arm’s length from your work area.These references
should include a dictionary, a thesaurus, an office reference manual, your own
desk manual, telephone directories, and the like. When you need these books,
you need them now; you should never have to look for any of them.
13. Do you really know what is in your desk and cabinets? Schedule fifteen to
thirty minutes every month to purge your current bookshelves, desk drawers,
and cabinets. You must keep current with the contents of your workstation.
Keep the wastebasket and recycling box handy; you should constantly purge
your workstation of unwanted materials.
14. If there is a bulletin board in your workstation, be sure the information is cur-
rent and well organized. If the bulletin board is not easy to use, it is just occu-
pying space and adding to the office clutter. A bulletin board is sometimes an
invitation to clutter; if not in use,you may consider removing the bulletin board.
166

Time Management
15. After you take a telephone message, place the message in a designated loca-
tion, off your desk or send the message electronically to the appropriate indi-
vidual. In this way, you have dismissed the task immediately. You are then free
to continue with your other tasks, and your desk is less cluttered.
16. Use colored paper to coordinate your tasks as it draws attention. Using color
will assist you in locating categories of information. For example, you will be
able to quickly spot blue telephone messages in a pile of white documents. Not
only will the colored paper help you get organized but it will also draw the at-
tention of others to requests for action or information you place on their desks.
Try using fluorescent-colored paper when you want to get immediate attention.
17. Your workstation will require drawer space for office supplies. Store only a
limited supply at your desk; store larger amounts away from your worksta-
tion in a supply area or cabinet.The small supplies you keep at your desk such
as a stapler, tape, pens, clips, and the like can be stored with drawer organiz-
ers. Letterhead, envelopes, forms, and other major paper supplies should be
placed in drawer trays, not left out in visible stacks.
18. Your personal items need a place too, but do not crowd your desk surface with
family photos. Leave the desk surface as clear as possible and place the pho-
tos on top of your credenza or filing cabinet. For personal photos, using the
same picture frames will help to avoid a cluttered look.
Use Follow-up Organizers
Follow-up organizers aid office professionals in remembering details and meeting
deadlines. In addition to the daily appointment calendar, which you will study in
Chapter 10, and the to-do list, office professionals must have a foolproof method
of following up on work that will be pending for a week, a month, or longer. The
tickler file, which provides reminders according to dates, is the most widely used.
A pending file, which is defined in a following paragraph, can be used for actual
documents-in-progress to be processed by specific dates.
Tickler File
Folders can be used to organize a tickler file, depending on the work to be followed
up.A tickler file is a paper time management system that can be used for reminders
of (1) work to be done at a specified time and (2) incoming
information that is anticipated at a specified time. A tickler
file set, available at office suppliers, consists of twelve fold-
ers with the names of the months printed on the tabs and
thirty-one folders with 1 through 31 printed on the tabs to
indicate the days of the month. To set up a tickler folder file,
place the folders for days of the month, followed by the
guides for the months as shown in Figure 6.
Do not put original correspondence in the follow-up fold-
ers. Make a copy of the original or prepare a memo referring
to it for the tickler file; note the location of the original
paper on the memo. When you put memos in the folder, use
either 81⁄2  11-inch sheets of paper or staple small notes to a
large sheet.All your notations for the tickler file do not have to
be printed. If you recorded the information in longhand as
instructions were given or a request was made, you may file
these notes as a reminder.

Time Management
Place a reminder in the file for the date you must begin a task, not the date you
must complete it. Follow the same plan concerning reminders for your manager.
For instance, if you estimate that it will take you three days to type a periodic re-
port due on Friday, June 30, file the reminder in the folder labeled 27.
A tickler file cannot jog your memory unless you use it. Each morning, with-
out fail, remove the reminders for the day from the tickler file. Place that folder at
the end of the numbered folders. As a result, the current folder will always be at
the front of the file.
The reminders will fall into three categories:
• those that have already been taken care of;
• reminders of work you must carry out that day;
• items that must be postponed.
Discard any copies or notes pertaining to items completed. Return to the file an
item that is still pending. For instance, if you received an acknowledgment saying
that a catalog you requested will be sent as soon as the new catalog is reprinted,
probably within two weeks, put the reminder back in the file at a date approxi-
mately two weeks later.
Near the end of each week as you are planning your work for the following
week, review the reminders in the tickler file for the entire week. Estimate the time
you will need to complete each task. Remember to coordinate the items to be com-
pleted in your tickler file with your to-do list.
On the first day of each month, arrange any reminders for the current month by
dates. For example, on the first day of April remove the papers in the April folder and
sort and file them by date into the numbered files. Place the folder labeled April be-
hind the March folder.As you transfer the items from the month file to the daily files,
turn folders representing dates for Saturdays and Sundays backward, and then you
will be less likely to inadvertently file a reminder in a folder with a weekend date.
You can accomplish the same thing as a tickler file by adding notes to your cal-
endar. However, if you have bits of notes posted to your computer monitor or on
the wall in your work area, you can eliminate these notes by placing them in the
tickler folders.
Pending File
A pending file supports your regular calendars and holds the actual documents to
be completed by specific dates. You should check the pending file regularly to be
sure nothing has been overlooked. A pending file is a booklet, made of sturdy card
stock, and has dividers labeled 1 through 31.

Ethics Regarding Your Work,
Time, and Other Resources
As you learned in Chapter 1,ethical concepts have a far-reaching effect on today’s busi-
ness offices.The ethical office is an extension of the ethical organization, an organiza-
tion that acts with integrity and lives up to its responsibilities and obligations.
It encourages employees to assume their responsibilities by authorizing and entrusting
people to complete their job or task ethically and to the best of their ability.
Our ethical responsibilities need to be reviewed with this level of trust. If you
find yourself considering any of the following, your organization’s policies and
trust are likely to be compromised.
WITH REGARD TO WORK
These examples show how employees have demonstrated unethical behavior re-
garding their work:
• practicing plagiarism, using the words or ideas of someone else as your own
without permission or reference to the original source;
• harassing co-workers;
• making false claims of illness;
• exaggerating accomplishments, such as those shown on a resume or in a monthly
report to supervisors;
• providing negative public statements about the organization, such as the ones
that are sometimes shown on YouTube, MySpace, or Facebook.
WITH REGARD TO TIME
Here are a few ways employees have shown disregard for their company’s values:
• going home early—consistently;
• taking extended breaks;
• taking frequent smoking breaks;
• getting to work late—consistently;
• gossiping in the office;
• taking personal telephone calls—consistently;
• talking too long on personal telephone calls.
WITH REGARD TO OTHER RESOURCES
Some organizations have noted the following unethical behavior in their employ-
ees regarding other resources:
• playing computer games;
• conducting personal research on the Internet;
• exaggerating time devoted to a task or project;
• taking paper, paper clips, binders, stamps, and other office supplies.
Consider your company’s code of ethics as well as your own standards. Ask
yourself if you would feel comfortable if the results of your decision or action were

Discussed in previous chapters, when you face ethical situations, you face a decision. To justify questionable conduct, people have de-
veloped some common rationalizations. In Supervision Today, authors Stephen Robbins and David DeCenzo identify common rationaliza-
tions (2007). Below are two examples of common rationalizations.Answer these questions:What does it mean? What are examples of this
situation or issue?

2. “No one will find out.”

Time Management in Other Cultures
The essence of time management—organizing and sequencing tasks—may be per-
ceived by different cultures in different ways. For example, imagine you are a lo-
cal employee in the home office in Venezuela, and a Canadian employee comes by
for her 2 p.m. appointment. She arrives promptly and, as you greet and begin to
help her, you also handle a telephone call, answer a co-worker’s question, and send
a fax to someone else. From your point of view and in line with your perception
of time management, you consider that you are very efficient; you are, after all, ac-
complishing several other tasks in addition to dealing with the visitor. However,
from your visitor’s point of view, she may feel that your activity is unfocused and
not as efficient as it could be. She may even perceive your multitasking while meet-
ing with her as an indication that her visit is unimportant or a disruption to your
routine and that it has not been given the appropriate attention.
Don’t make assumptions. Learn to understand other cultures’ personal styles
and preferences for getting work done by determining their approach to time man-
agement. Discussing those issues with people who are members of the culture you
want to understand will result in greater understanding and acceptance by all.

Building Your Office Skills
Exploring the Workplace: Activities
1. How many unfinished projects do you have? Are
you burdened with the thought that “everything is
started and nothing is finished”? Make a list of your
unfinished projects and tasks. Select the one you can
finish in the least amount of time and complete it.
Select another task you can complete in a few min-
utes and then complete it. Notice how you lighten
your load by finishing tasks. Use what you have dis-
covered to remind yourself to finish tasks as soon as
possible, leaving your mind free to tackle new as-
signments. Write a memorandum to your instructor
describing your list of unfinished projects and tasks
and the tasks you completed in the least amount of
time. Also, describe what you have learned from
completing this activity and how it will help you to
list and prioritize future projects and tasks.
2. Are you using bits and pieces of time? To find out,
keep a record (a spreadsheet is an excellent tool to
set up your record). Begin by keeping a to-do list. In
the left column, jot down at random everything you
think you must do other than the major tasks. Leave
space to the right of each item. As you complete
each task, write down the date, the number of min-
utes used, and when. For example, was it between
classes? Were you waiting for your ride? Was it at
lunchtime? At the end of one week, determine how
much extra time you gained by using bits and pieces
of time. Multiply your answer by 52 to estimate the
time you could gain in one year. Write a brief sum-
mary to your instructor and attach your record. Be
prepared to report your results to the class.
3. Keep a time distribution chart for two weeks similar
to the one in Figure 2. (Using Excel is an excellent
tool to set up your chart.) Write down what you are
doing, what the task involves or refers to, and who
else is involved if the task is a meeting or an ap-
pointment. Also assign a priority to the task: 1, 2, 3,
or 4. Then note whether the activity was planned (P)
or involved an interruption (I). At the end of two
weeks, analyze your chart for the following:
a. Telephone calls.
Add up the calls made or
received during the two-week period. How
many qualified as legitimate; how many were
unwelcome interruptions?
b. Drop-in visitors.
Add drop-ins; what
percentage of the day do these get-togethers
consume? How many were legitimate; how
many qualified as unwelcome?
c. Paperwork, projects, writing, planning.
How
many of these activities qualified as a top
priority? As 2s, 3s, or 4s? Averaging more than
three or four number 1 priorities per day means
ineffective planning or inaccurate rating.
d. Other activities.
Consider all remaining
entries. Again, ask yourself if the remaining
tasks are legitimate or unwelcome,
unnecessary, or “firefighting.”
After your analysis,respond to the following questions:
• Am I complicating tasks, putting more time into
them than necessary?
• Am I using efficient techniques whenever possible?

Time Management
• Am I taking on inappropriate work? Being effec-
tive? Doing too much for others? Failing to dele-
gate, if possible?
Summarize the results from your analysis in memo-
randum format to be shared with another class
member. Compare the results and discuss how im-
provements can be made toward managing your re-
sources. Be prepared to submit your report to your
instructor along with your notes from meeting with
your team member.
4. Divide into teams and visit an office supply store and
look at work and time organizers. Next, compare
these organizers with available time organizer soft-
ware (for example, paper desk calendars versus
electronic calendars). As a team, summarize your
findings of the manual versus electronic work and
time organizers. Be prepared to share the summary
with other class teams and to submit the summary to
your instructor. If the activity is completed as a team,
be certain to identify your team members’ names
and each person’s contribution to the activity.

Enter your response after each situation.
1. Telephone interruptions. You have a new job and
have been working for three weeks. Each afternoon
before leaving work, you carefully plan your work
for the next day.You are having difficulty keeping up
with your plan because the telephone rings continu-
ally. You are becoming frustrated because you must
answer so many telephone calls.
• What problems could be causing this situation?
• What stress-reducing techniques can you use?
• What are some solutions to resolve the situation?
2. Lack of organizational skills. Jon, one of your team
members, has confided in you about the lack of orga-
nizational skills shown by his supervisor, Selina. He
describes his supervisor as one who focuses on rela-
tionships but not on details.In other words,she works
well with employees; however, she always seems to be
“handling a crisis”rather than planning to avoid one.
Selina has difficulty in keeping up with her corre-
spondence, and her office looks like a construction
crew has worked in it.Lately,she has missed some ma-
jor deadlines. Jon has asked you to help him help his
supervisor. With another class member, discuss Jon’s
supervisor’s situation and complete the following:
• What problems can you identify in the supervi-
sor’s situation?
• List as many ways as you can to help Jon ap-
proach his supervisor. Discuss the advantages
and disadvantages of each item you have listed.
• Suggest at least three solutions to help Jon help
his supervisor to manage her work, time, and
other resources.
3. Stressed out. You work for five managers, and to-
day one of the managers, Jean Forrester, has sent
three reports to you for final completion with a spe-
cial request to finish this work by this afternoon at
5:30 p.m. However, the other three managers have
also assigned work to you and expect you to com-
plete the assignments right away. You have had
some difficulty in completing one of the assign-
ments, you have missed lunch, and now you are be-
coming frustrated due to the pressure of completing
all the work.
• What problems can you identify in this situation?
• What stress-reducing techniques can you use?
• What can you do to resolve this situation?
4. Inefficient performance. Mickel Rasmussen is a
new member on your team. You have noticed that
his desk is messy; he cannot find certain telephone
directories, supplies, and reference materials. He
is constantly asking others for information that he
has but doesn’t want to or can’t locate. Mickel has
materials stacked in piles on his desk and on the
floor around his desk. He has had trouble deter-
mining priorities and has not produced his work
in a timely fashion. You realize that Mickel’s work
is being haphazardly performed. Your manager
has come to you to discuss Mickel’s inefficient
performance.
• Identify the problems in this situation.
• Suggest ways that Mickel could improve his
efficiency.
• In your approach to Mickel, consider what you
want to achieve and what you want to avoid.

PART I: THE WORK ENVIRONMENT
INTEGRATED PROJECT
The Integrated Project continues to allow you
opportunities to develop your office administration
skills by
• performing general office functions.
• preparing a variety of documents.
• being resourceful in obtaining, organizing,
analyzing, evaluating, and managing information.
• enhancing your communication and interpersonal
skills.
• using critical thinking skills to make effective decisions.
• working independently or working as a team member.
Supreme Appliances provides a realistic, challenging,
and interesting work environment. Throughout this
integrated project, you will continue to serve in your
current position and will report to Ms. Quevedo.
The projects are divided into six parts as identified
in the Table of Contents of your text. Each part includes
several chapters and contains one Integrated Project
that consists of multiple tasks. The tasks highlight the
skills to be practiced throughout the entire project.
Tasks within each project are numbered. Some activities
are further subdivided into two or more tasks.
Here’s how you begin:
• Review the instructions before beginning the
project’s tasks.
• Determine the supplies needed.
• Identify the time management tools and
strategies to use.
• Download the To-Do list from the Web site; list
the tasks, the beginning and ending time,
checking off the tasks as you complete them.
• Follow your instructor’s directions about styles
(letter, memo, report).
Be sure to follow these steps after you complete the
tasks:
• Proofread each document.
• Check your document for spelling, grammar, and
punctuation.
• Verify the spell-checker found all the errors.
• Finish the To-Do list by completing the time log
portion for each task and submit it with the
activities.
• If submitting the documents electronically, save the
activities as lastname-P1T1, for Part I Task 1. For
example, kirkland-P1T1, which would identify the
first task completed under Part I.
• Follow your instructor’s steps to submit the
activities.
• With the help of a team member or your instructor,
select the best activities representative of your work
from the Integrated Project to be included in your
portfolio.
Task 1: Telecommuting 
Conduct Internet Research; 
Write a Report; Write a Memo
Supreme Appliances has continued to grow as sales
have increased. Office space is becoming a problem and
Henry Pippen, the company president, has asked
managers to offer recommendations on how to solve
this problem. Ms. Quevedo has recommended the
company offer certain employees the opportunity to
telecommute to open up office space. As you learned,
telecommuting allows an employee to work from home
or other location while connected to the office via
computer, fax machine, access to the Internet, telephone
services using voice mail, paging, and conference
calling. Computer group software is available that will
allow an employee to e-mail and share calendars and
assignments.
Your Task
Ms. Quevedo has asked you to research
telecommuting for her using your library or Internet.
Upon completing your research, you are to compose 
a report describing telecommuting, advantages,
disadvantages, and suggested employee guidelines.
Complete the checklist that includes a time log of the
time you spent on this report. Be sure to include your
INTRODUCTION TO THE EXPANDED SIMULATION
178

Time Management
sources. Write a cover memorandum to your instructor
attaching the report and time log.
Task 2: Teambuilding 
Conduct Internet Research; 
Create Rosters
Ms. Quevedo is concerned about the lack of teamwork
in the division and what she perceives to be a stressed
staff. Three times this month she has discussed with
different team leaders problems that have arisen in their
teams. Other comments have been made about the high
stress level of some employees because of the pressure
caused by deadlines.
Your Task
Ms. Quevedo has asked you to make two
lists that will be circulated through the staff. Both
rosters will list seminars or workshop names, dates, and
registration fees. Prepare one list of Stress Management
seminars and another list of Team-Building seminars.
Use the Internet to find actual seminars. Complete the
checklist that includes a time log of the time you spent
on this activity. Write a cover memorandum to your
instructor attaching the two lists and the time log.
Task 3: Using Job Boards
Conduct Research; Complete a Survey;
Write a Report
Although you are not looking for another job at the
moment, you would like to continue to invest time and
effort in becoming familiar with the kinds of available
positions at Supreme Appliances. Doing so allows you
to understand that job awareness is an important part
of your education. Many people know surprisingly little
about the work done in their occupation and the
training requirements. You would like to study job
openings in your field so you can compare information
appearing on different online job boards. The job
boards provide opportunities to learn what’s available,
what qualifications are necessary, and what salaries are
being offered.
Your Task
To get started, select a position title, such as
office assistant, administrative assistant, or executive
assistant. Click on one of the following job boards:
• www.monster.com
• www.careerbuilder.com
• www.hotjobs.com
Choose three ads for the selected position title and
analyze the skills required. Create your own checklist,
follow your instructor’s directions, or respond to the
following questions:
• How often do the ads mention
• interpersonal skills, such as teamwork or
customer service?
• written communication skills?
• oral communication skills?
• Microsoft® Office software skills?
• telephone skills?
• What specific tasks do the ads mention?
• What salary is mentioned in the ad for this
position?
• What work experience is mentioned?
Present this information in a format that allows
your instructor or class members to easily review the
results of your survey. Complete a time log of the time
you spent on this activity. Submit the activity according
to your instructor’s directions.
Task 4: Overcoming 
Time Management Problems 
Analyze a Case Study; Write a Report
With some people, time management can be a minor
problem; however, with others, it is a source of
considerable stress and anxiety. Your co-worker and
friend, Chan, works in another department at Supreme
Appliances and has come to you for help. She recognizes
that she has problems managing her time. She shares the
following situation that occurred last week. Her report
was due on Wednesday, so she started last Monday.
Her desk is cluttered with project notebooks, file
folders, and articles, so she decided to work on her
laptop on another desk in her area. When she began
the report, she discovered she needed some
information from the Accounting Department. Rather
than obtaining the information at that time, she
thought she would begin another part of the report
and would get the information later in the day. After
about fifteen minutes of working on the report, her
supervisor asked her to attend a meeting that will take
about one-and-a-half hours. Because her supervisor
was called upon to attend another meeting, Chan was
179

Time Management
asked to attend in his place. After the meeting, she
returned to her office to find your e-mail asking her to
go to a new restaurant for lunch, and she agreed to go.
During lunch, Chan mentioned she had a report to
complete by Wednesday; you recall that she
mentioned, “I’m more productive when I work under
pressure. I have plenty of time to complete the report.”
By the time Chan returned from lunch, she discovered
that her supervisor had delegated additional tasks, all
of which needed to be completed by Monday
afternoon and by noon on Tuesday.
On Tuesday morning, she finishes the tasks and
returns to the report. This task proved to be more
difficult than she thought it would be. She needed
advice from her supervisor, who had called in because
he was ill and wouldn’t be in the office for the day. She
phoned another manager, but all she got was a voice
mail saying she was in training for the day. Chan began
to think she wouldn’t get the report finished on time. It
needed to be on her supervisor’s desk the first thing on
Wednesday. She’d have to do some quick work on
Tuesday afternoon; it wouldn’t be her best work, of
course, but that couldn’t be helped. Late Tuesday
afternoon, Chan remembered to contact the Accounting
Department only to discover a voice mail indicating the
person was on vacation and would be out for the week.
On Wednesday morning, Chan wakes up after 
7:30 a.m., having found she had forgotten to set her
alarm clock. She reaches her desk twenty minutes late.
Your Task
In a report, list Chan’s time management
problems. List at least five strategies and explain how
Chan could use these strategies to overcome her time
management problems.

Telecommunications
T
oday, the telephone is an essential office tool that every employee has, and it
rings and rings and rings. Couple the volume of telephone calls with a virtual
deluge of faxes and e-mail, and we begin to recognize our dependence on
telecommunication services in the office.
Businesses rely heavily on technology to conduct their day-to-day operations
and communicate with their customers internally and externally. However, the
value of using technology depends largely on how effectively employees are
trained to use the technology.Through office professionals who are trained in tele-
phone techniques and in the use of technology, companies can achieve one of their
continuous improvement goals—customer focus.
You’ll need personal and interpersonal skills in today’s workplace. To provide
effective customer service using the telephone, you will use the same personal and
interpersonal skills as well as the communication skills discussed in that chapter.
When you use the telephone to communicate with people inside and outside
the company, you are the voice of your organization. In each conversation, you are
creating an impression, and the caller does not know whether your office is “un-
der construction or under control.”Whatever the situation may be, the caller forms
an opinion of the department, organization, its management and employees, and
its products and services by the way you answer and handle a telephone call.
Next to face-to-face communication, the telephone is one of the most impor-
tant links to customer service. Suppose your company has just spent thousands of
dollars to update its telephone system but ignores the manner in which its em-
ployees use the telephone. Think about the small company that cannot afford to
promote its image in the mass media but must rely on the image created by its em-
ployees who answer the telephones and make calls to customers and clients. Think
for a minute about the image you project on the telephone. Is your voice pleasant?
Are you positive? Are you sincere in helping to resolve a situation? It is easy to un-
derstand why employees who become proficient in their telephone skills will in-
crease their value to any organization. Your success depends on your
communication skills and knowledge of the tips and techniques presented in this
chapter to make and receive telephone calls.
Using Your Communication Skills
Speaking clearly, listening actively, and using correct grammar are essential skills
in communicating successfully and in projecting a professional image, and this is
especially true in telephone communications.
SPEAK CLEARLY
The following discussion is related to the use of the telephone.
Above all, speak clearly and in a positive tone. If you do not speak clearly, the
customer can become frustrated with the conversation and be left with an unpro-
fessional image of your company. Because we cannot rely on nonverbal expres-
sions when speaking on the telephone, our tone and words must be especially clear
to communicate effectively. Make your voice an asset at all times and under all cir-
cumstances.The better you sound, the better you and your company are perceived.
184

Telecommunications
“wouldja” for “would you”
“wanna” for “want to”
“gimme” for “give me”
“innerview” for “interview”
The voice you project is determined by how well you can demonstrate the follow-
ing elements:
Volume
Speak as though you were talking to someone across the desk from you. Of course,
if the caller is having difficulty hearing you, you may have to adjust your speech
volume to accommodate the caller.
Rate of Speed
If you speak too quickly, you may run one word into the next. Speak distinctly at
a rate that is neither too fast nor too slow. Speaking at the proper rate will enable
you to appear confident and poised. Furthermore, the caller will not be able to un-
derstand you if you talk too rapidly and may ask you to repeat information. Avoid
speaking rapidly in greeting your caller. Because you have to repeat the introduc-
tion so often, you may have a tendency to say the greeting rapidly.
Inflection
The term inflection means to vary the tone of your voice to bring out the meaning
of what you say and add emphasis to what is said. Emphasizing a person’s name
by varying your tone can leave a positive impression.
Quality
Let your voice show that you have a smile on your face, that you are courteous
and enthusiastic, and that you are ready and willing to help the caller. If you need
help with adding a smile while talking on the telephone, add a small mirror to your
desk area or stick a smiley face on your telephone. A voice that conveys a smile
will project an image of a courteous and enthusiastic worker who is ready and
willing to help—a professional image.
Pronunciation
Pronunciation means saying each word correctly, clearly, and distinctly by moving
your lips, tongue, and jaw freely. For example, how often have you heard:
Common errors in pronunciation include the following:
Distort Sounds
In particular dialects of English, some people will transpose letters in certain words
to distort sounds. For example, someone may say, “May I ax you a question?” Of
course, the correct word is ask, not ax.
Omit Sounds
For instance, the r in February has been dropped so the month is almost always
pronounced as Febuary.
185

Telecommunications
Add Sounds
Although the previous two errors involve distorting sounds or omitting sounds
from a word sometimes, a sound (or syllable) gets added. For example, the correct
pronunciation is disastrous, not disasterous.
LISTEN ACTIVELY
Effective listening is active rather than passive. In passive listening, you absorb the
information given. If the caller provides a clear message and makes it interesting
enough to keep your attention, you will probably get most of what the caller in-
tended to communicate. Active listening requires you to understand the message
from the caller’s point of view. Hearing is easy; but active listening is hard work.
To be an active listener, you must focus on the following elements: concentration,
empathy, acceptance, and responsibility. In Supervision Today, authors Stephen
Robbins and David De Cenzo offer these recommendations:
Concentration
You must be engaged in active listening—that is, really concentrating and asking
questions of the caller. If you are not engaged in the listening process, the mind
tends to wander because it does not have enough to keep it busy. To help you fo-
cus on what the caller is saying, ask open-ended questions, ones that cannot be an-
swered with a “yes” or “no.” Obtaining responses to open-ended questions helps
you to gather more information, clarify intent or feelings, and expand the content
of the message. To remember important information that might be relevant later,
concentrate on what the caller is saying, not on what your next response will be.
You can increase your ability to listen actively by eliminating distractions, such as
someone talking to you while you are on the telephone or continuing to keyboard
while you are talking to the caller.
Empathy
You must demonstrate empathy, which means you must try to understand what
the caller wants to communicate rather than what you want to understand.
Empathy means that you put yourself in the caller’s shoes. If you hold your
thoughts and feelings while the caller is explaining, chances are you will increase
the likelihood you will interpret the message being communicated in the way the
caller intended.To demonstrate empathy, validate the caller’s feelings and share their
feelings about the issue at hand. Here are a few examples:
• “I understand how you feel right now; you are frustrated and angry. I would be
too if I were in your situation.” “Gee, that is confusing; please let me help you
with that. . . .”
• “Of course, I would be upset too if that happened to me. As soon as we end this
call, I will. . . .”
• “That is really disappointing. I can understand how you feel. When my super-
visor returns, I will. . . .”
Acceptance
To demonstrate acceptance, you must listen objectively without judging content
until the caller is finished. It’s natural to be distracted by the content of what a
caller says, especially when you disagree with it. When you hear something you

disagree with, you have a tendency to begin formulating mental arguments to
counter what is being said. In doing so, you often miss the rest of the message. Lis-
tening objectively is a challenge; be alert to demonstrating acceptance.
Responsibility
As an active listener, take responsibility for completeness. That is, ask questions to
gather information to determine the intended meaning from the caller. Take notes
to help you with details of the conversation.
USE CORRECT GRAMMAR
Along with speaking clearly and listening actively, using correct grammar helps
project a professional image. When you use incorrect grammar, your image, and
that of your organization, is at stake. That is, your use of poor grammar reflects
negatively on your professionalism. Your image cannot rely solely on your techni-
cal skills. You must strengthen your grammar skills, including subject and verb
agreement and sentence structure. The following examples represent common er-
rors in grammar:
Grammar
Grammar errors occur in many ways. For example, when the subject in a sentence
does not agree with the verb. For instance, “Our projections have steadily de-
clined,” not “. . . has steadily declined.” In sentence structure, the following exam-
ple would be written as “My manager and his assistant are flying to both Seattle
and San Francisco,” not “. . . both to Seattle and San Francisco.”
Jargon, Technical Terms, or Local Sayings
Use caution in choosing words to convey your meaning. People outside your com-
pany, culture, and geographic location may not have the same level of under-
standing that you have regarding the following phrases:

Making Productive Telephone Calls
Suppose you need to make a telephone call to Energy Resources. To do this, you
pick up the telephone and begin dialing the company. After dialing the number,
you begin thinking about the conversation you are about to have with the com-
pany representative. Now you realize you should have referred to a folder that
contained information related to your call. You also realize you should have writ-
ten down a few questions related to the information contained in the folder. Dur-
ing the conversation you feel frustrated because you seem to be shuffling papers
within the folder and do not appear to be organized with your thoughts. Although
you obtained the needed information, you feel you could have been much more
productive in handling the call.
The key to making productive telephone calls is to establish a system for
managing your time and resources. This section provides ideas for helping you to
establish an effective system.
BE PREPARED
Before you place a call, assemble the materials you may need to refer to during the
conversation. Write down the questions you want to ask and comments you want
to make. Be sure you have the correct number and name of the person with whom
you wish to speak.
Use Telephone Directories
A local telephone directory is available for every telephone. Directories for other
geographic areas may be obtained, for a nominal fee, by contacting the telephone
company that publishes the directory or by using some free websites where you
can look up telephone numbers. However, the numbers provided online may not
be as complete and as up to date as those from phone companies.
Company Staff Directory. Organizations provide their employees with a staff
directory for calling other employees within the organization. Organization or
staff directories are usually provided as a list available from the office computer.
Alternatively, some offices provide hard-copy office directories. Both computer-
based and hard-copy office directories can be easily updated as staff and telephone
assignments change. The company directory may be updated by the human re-
sources department or by the public information office. Depending on the situa-
tion, you may be called upon to update the directory information for your
department.
188

Telecommunications
• Refer to the introductory pages of your organization’s directory for policies
concerning telephone use and procedures to follow when placing calls. In addi-
tion to local numbers, an organization’s directory will include the telephone
numbers of its branch offices, plants, distribution centers, and other facilities lo-
cated outside the local area.
Public Telephone Directories. An office professional should become skilled at
using the alphabetic and classified sections of public telephone directories and
should be thoroughly familiar with the telephone procedures described in the
introductory section of the local directory. The front pages of many directories
contain useful information such as
• information that provides emergency and non-emergency numbers;
• information guide and consumer tips provide a variety of free facts and answers
about things to buy and services needed;
• community pages provide attractions, events, and the general-interest informa-
tion unique to a particular area. Often, maps are provided on these pages;
• phone service pages answer questions you may have about your phone service;
• an index to help you locate information.
If you frequently call government offices, become familiar with their listings.
Government offices are listed in the alphabetic directory according to political
divisions—federal, state, county, and city offices, respectively. Government listings
are sometimes found in a special colored section in some directories.
The alphabetic directory, which may be a separate volume or may be bound
with the classified directory, contains the name, address, and telephone number of
every subscriber in the local calling area, except for those with unlisted numbers.
Names of individuals and organizations are listed in alphabetical order.
• For the sake of speed, circle new numbers in the alphabetic directory as you lo-
cate them.
• If you do not complete a call on the first attempt, enter the number in your elec-
tronic file or write the number in your notebook so that you won’t have to look
it up again. If you anticipate that you will be using a number often, enter it di-
rectly into your telephone, transfer the name and number to your telephone
card file or computer telephone list.
• When you are given an unlisted number, be sure to record it. You will not be
able to look up the number elsewhere. Indicate on your telephone record that
the number is unlisted.
Classified Directories. The classified directory, called the yellow pages, is
arranged by subject for products and services. Listings under each subject are then
arranged in alphabetical order.
• To use the yellow pages, think of all the possible ways the reference you are
seeking may be listed, and search first for the most likely classification.
Some yellow pages directories offer a Special Guide section or a Quick Reference
section at the beginning of the book; these sections can save a lot of time. An
alternative to the traditional yellow pages is the talking yellow pages, a supple-
mental publication. This service is provided by the local telephone company and
189

small businesses; its purpose is to help the general public locate business informa-
tion. It is similar to voice mail in two ways:
• It has business information stored in voice mailboxes.
• Users access those voice mailboxes through numeric instructions.
Directories for 800 Numbers. A company may list its telephone number in a di-
rectory as an 800 number. Companies using 800 numbers are automatically billed
for charges.
• If you do not know if a company has an 800 listing, dial 1-800-555-1212 and
give the operator the name of the company. A directory of 800 numbers is also
available for those who use such numbers frequently.
Online Telephone Directories. You can locate telephone information about a com-
pany by accessing the Internet. For example, you can locate 800 numbers by using
key search words such as 1-800 telephone directory. The search will provide a list-
ing of different references that will help you locate a 1-800 telephone directory.
Many companies offer free access to yellow pages online directories.
• Search the Web using key search words such as yellow pages directories. In
some cases, once you have the information, you will be able to select a map to
help you locate a particular company.
Examples of online telephone directories include but are not limited to the
following:

Your organizational skills are evident when you can handle tele-
phone calls in the most efficient manner. Be mindful of the receiver of
your call, who is busy and probably on “information overload” as
well. Being prepared sends the message that you are time conscious.
INTRODUCE YOURSELF
Some guidelines to follow:
•
If the first person you reach by telephone is the receptionist, give
the extension number of the person you are calling (Figure 1).
•
If you do not know the extension number, give the receptionist the
person’s name and department. Receptionists will often say the
person’s extension number as they look it up; others will give you
a number if you request it. Write down extension numbers and add
them to your telephone card file or computer address book.
•
Give the person ample time to answer. Let the telephone ring at
least four or five times. If the person who answers is not the one
FIGURE 1 • Receptionist receiving

with whom you wish to speak, ask for the person and identify yourself: “May
I speak to Miss Wetherby? This is Sonja Alvarez of Delta Manufacturing.”
• When you do not need to speak to a particular person, make your request of the
person who answers. Although some people prefer to add a “good morning” or
“good afternoon” to their identification, others feel it is time consuming.
CONCLUDE CALLS EFFICIENTLY
Be mindful of the receiver of your call by concluding calls efficiently. To maintain
your professional image, end the call on a positive note. Here are a few tips to use
when concluding your calls:
• Use the receiver’s name.
• Summarize comments, agreements, actions, and responsibilities.
• Get agreement on the summary.
• Thank the person for his or her time.
For example, “Mr. Slaton, I understand the report will be completed by Monday,
June 27, and you will send it to me by e-mail. I will review it and add my supervi-
sor’s attachments and return the report to you by this Thursday. Is that correct?”
By using these tips to conclude your calls efficiently, your receiver will appre-
ciate your professional attitude.
LEAVE MESSAGES
So many times people leave messages with only their name and telephone number.
Sometimes, a person leaves a message with just his or her first name, believing he
or she is the only Juan, Shondra, or Almas. If you cannot reach the person called,
leave a complete message that includes the following:
• your first and last name;
• company name;
• reason for call;
• telephone number including area code;
• best time to return the call.

Receiving Telephone Calls
Every time you answer the telephone, you are projecting the image of your orga-
nization. To the caller, you are the organization. You must depend on your voice
to project a pleasant, businesslike attitude and to give the caller your full attention.
This section provides you with some specific tips for receiving telephone calls.
ANSWER PROMPTLY
Answer the telephone no later than the third or fourth ring. An unanswered tele-
phone conveys an image of inefficiency. However, do not lift the receiver and let
the caller wait while you finish a conversation with someone in the office—this is
discourteous.To be clearly understood, ensure that the mouthpiece or microphone
is close to your lips, no more than one inch away, and speak directly into it in a
normal, conversational tone; use just enough volume for your voice to be pleasant
to the listener.
IDENTIFY YOURSELF
Let the caller know that the right office has been reached. If the incoming calls are
answered by a receptionist, he or she will say,“Good morning (or good afternoon),
Delta Manufacturing.” When the receptionist rings your telephone, you can say,
“Sales Department, this is Sonja Alvarez.”
Your manager may tell you specifically how the telephone should be answered.
If your manager does not tell you, ask. Never answer a business telephone with
“Hello.” “Hello” is considered to be too casual for the business office. It is cour-
teous to let the caller know who you are. To identify yourself, use both your first
and last names.
When telephone calls come directly to your office, first let the callers know
they have reached the right organization; then add the identification for the par-
ticular telephone you are answering, and give your name. Example: “Delta Man-
ufacturing, Sales Department. This is Sonja.”
When you answer the telephone for many managers, code each station on your
telephone, so you can give proper identification for each person whose telephone
you are answering.
TAKE COMPLETE MESSAGES
You have several options when taking telephone messages; you may use your com-
puter system’s e-mail message form for telephone messages or keep a small notebook,
pen, and pad of message forms by the telephone. Spare yourself the embarrassment
of asking a caller to wait while you look for a pen or pencil. Many people think tak-
ing telephone messages is a simple task. It is simple enough, but handling this task in-
efficiently wastes time and may cause loss of customer goodwill and business.
There are seven essential elements in a complete telephone message:
1. The date and time of call. The time of the call is important; for instance, if
your manager talked with the caller at lunch, the manager needs to know if
the call was made before or after lunch.
2. The complete name of the caller, spelled correctly. Remember that your man-
ager does not know every Lawrence or José who calls. If you do not know
how to spell the caller’s name, ask him or her to spell it for you.
192

Telecommunications
3.
The telephone number with area code. Some
callers will say your manager or the person for
whom this call is intended has the number. You
can simply explain you would like to save your
manager the time it would take to look up the
number. Larger cities have more than one area
code. For example, the Dallas/Fort Worth metro-
politan area has 214, 972, 817, and 469.
4.
The business name of the caller.
5.
All pertinent information to help the person for
whom the call was intended know what to expect
when returning the call.
6.
Your initials. If you are the only person taking
messages, initialing the form is not necessary. If
several people are taking messages, it is helpful to
the person receiving the messages to know who
took the message should there be any questions
regarding the call.
7.
Always restate the message to ensure both you
and the caller have recorded it accurately and
entirely.
When you must record the name and the number
so someone can return the call, write it on a telephone
message form as the caller gives you the information.
A typical message form is illustrated in Figure 2. All of
the information on the message form is important; do
not skip any part. Telephone message books are available from office supply
stores. In some companies, message books are filed for three to six months. If there
is no office policy for filing your message books, consider keeping your book for
three months and then discarding it. During that time if you need proof of a mes-
sage taken or a person’s telephone number, you can find it in your message book.
BE CAREFUL WHEN ANSWERING CALLS FOR OTHERS
Be careful how you explain your manager’s and other coworkers’ absence from
the office. Here are some tips to follow when answering calls for your manager:
• Simply say, “He is away from his desk at the moment. May I ask him to call
you?” or “He is not here at the moment. How may I help you?”
• Avoid statements such as:
“He is in Denver.”
“He’s still at lunch.”
“He is in the hospital.”
“He hasn’t come in yet.”
“He is in a conference.”
In some companies, office professionals use their company’s communication
system to record telephone messages.They take messages by entering the information

using the keyboard. When the person for whom the calls are intended returns to
his or her workstation, the telephone messages can be retrieved via the computer.
As offices provide workers with training on their integrated information systems,
recording messages via the computer will become more popular.
The conference explanation has been overused and will be perceived as an
excuse or even as untrue. When it is true, you should state in a sincere way that
Mr. Berstein is in a meeting and suggest what time you expect him to return to
the office.
If your manager is out of town for a week or so, he or she may choose to ac-
cess his or her own calls by dialing the telephone number and using a private code.
However, if you are responsible for answering your manager’s calls, you might say,
“Mr. Berstein is not in the office this week. How may I help you?” or
“Mr. Berstein is not in the office this week. Nelva Kirkpatrick is assisting while
Mr. Berstein is away. May I transfer your call?”
Wait for a response. Give the caller the extension should there be other ques-
tions while your manager is away from the office.
In most organizations, managers answer their own telephones when they are
in the office. Alternatively, you may be expected to take all telephone calls and im-
mediately put them through to your manager. Here are some tips to follow:
• Know exactly whose telephones you are responsible for answering and when.
• Determine how you are to interrupt your manager with a telephone message
when he or she is in a meeting.
• Tell the caller that your manager is not available to answer a telephone call be-
fore you ask who is calling. If you ask who is calling before you let the caller
know your manager is not available, the caller may think he or she personally
is being screened. Refer to Chapter 10 for a discussion of how to interrupt your
manager when you think that a call is urgent enough to do so.
If you are answering the telephone for a coworker who has stepped away from
his or her workstation, let the caller know immediately. For instance, you may be-
gin by saying,
“Good afternoon, I am answering Manny’s line. This is Sondra. How may
I help you?”
As you have learned how to be careful when explaining the absence of your
manager, the same basics apply to your coworkers. How does it sound to a cus-
tomer if you say, “Manny went to lunch at 11:30, and I’m not sure when he will
return”? And, it is now 1:15 p.m.What impression does the customer have of your
organization?
TRANSFER CALLS PROPERLY
Nothing is more frustrating than to be transferred from one department to another
or two to three times within a department. Transferring calls properly not only in-
volves knowing how to use the transfer feature on your telephone but also know-
ing who performs various functions within your company. Your reputation is
enhanced as an office professional if you can demonstrate your proficiency in us-
ing the transfer feature on your telephone as well as your knowledge about who
does what in your organization. Here are some suggestions that can help you to
increase your efficiency in transferring calls.
194

Telecommunications
• Explain to the caller that you are going to transfer the call to someone else who
will handle the call. For example, you might say, “Mr. Jenkins in our account-
ing department will be able to help you rather than Miss Truong in our depart-
ment. May I transfer your call to him?”
• Be sure you transfer the call to the right person. Knowing who does what can
provide you with the information as to the appropriate person to handle a trans-
fer call. Never transfer a call on the speculation that the person to whom you
are transferring the call might be helpful.
• Before you transfer the call, invite the caller to call you back if you have not re-
ferred him or her to the right person. If the caller does call back, offer to locate
the right person and refer the request to that person.
• Never say, “I will transfer you; if I should lose you, Mr. Brighton’s number is
531-6088.” Say, “For your reference, Mr. Brighton’s number is 531-6088. I will
transfer you now.” Give the caller the name and the telephone number of the
person to whom he or she is being transferred, so the caller can place the call
again if he or she is disconnected as you transfer the call.
• If your department cannot handle the request and you do not know who should
handle it, tell the caller so. For example, you might say, “I don’t know the an-
swer to your question; I will be happy to make some inquiries. May I call you
back in half an hour?” Another approach is to say, “I need to find out who has
that information. May I call you back in half an hour?” Be sure to follow
through on your promise. Doing so creates work for you, but it may result in
increased business for your organization as it creates a positive image. Be sure
to make a note about the action to be taken and the time to help remind you to
handle this situation without delay. If your organization has an electronic com-
munication system, such as Groupwise or Microsoft® Outlook, create a re-
minder to help you remember to handle this situation.
• Limit transfers as much as possible. Callers often find themselves being trans-
ferred three or four times. Imagine how frustrating this must be for them each
time they must repeat their story. In addition, three or four people will have been
interrupted by calls they cannot handle. When these callers reach you, stop the
runaround. Offer to locate someone who can help.
ANSWER A SECOND LINE
Many office professionals have two or more telephone lines into their offices. If
two telephones ring at the same time, answer one and ask the caller if you may be
excused to answer the other telephone. For example, “Law firm. This is Shandra.
I have another call coming in. May I put you on hold?” Do not leave the line un-
til the caller consents. Press the hold button and answer the second call. Then you
might say: “Law firm. This is Shandra. I am on another line. May I put you on
hold?” When you return to the line of the first caller, say,
“Thank you for holding, How may I direct your call?” or
“Thank you for holding. How may I help you?”
What you need to do to answer multiple calls depends on whether the calls are
local or long distance.
If the call is local, offer to call the second person back, after you have explained
why and return to the first caller. As soon as this conversation ends, dial the sec-
ond caller.
195

Telecommunications
When the second call is a long-distance call, do not offer to call back. Either
ask someone else to take the call or explain to the long-distance caller that you in-
terrupted a local call on another line in order to answer. Excuse yourself long
enough to get back to the first caller to say,“I will be with you in a minute.” Com-
plete the long-distance call as quickly as possible. Try not to keep the first caller
waiting more than a minute. When you get back to the first caller, apologize for
the delay and thank the caller for waiting. Use these same methods if you are talk-
ing on the telephone when the second telephone rings.
Office professionals who are handling multiple lines must learn how to handle
calls efficiently and maintain the overall image as their goal. You will experience
frustrating times when handling multiple telephone lines, but it is critical to busi-
ness and customer goodwill to keep a positive, helpful attitude during these times.
DISTRIBUTE MESSAGES PROMPTLY
Delaying the delivery of telephone messages to the appropriate people can cause
costly and perhaps embarrassing situations for your manager and coworkers. If
you are taking messages for your manager or covering someone else’s phone, place
the messages in a designated location in such a way that they will not be covered
by papers and overlooked. Avoid entering your manager’s work area to deliver
messages when he or she is trying to work without interruptions. The plan that
your manager uses for returning his or her calls depends on the daily schedule, the
pace of work, and his or her preferences.
If you receive calls from people who have previously called and left messages
with your manager but their calls haven’t been returned, simply say,“I will be sure
the message is delivered.” That’s all you can guarantee. Do not say your manager
will return the calls. It is up to your manager to decide which calls are of high (or
low) priority.
When your manager is unavailable, don’t just take messages—take the initia-
tive. Many telephone requests can be satisfied by you or by other coworkers within
your department or the company.
If your manager is away and telephones the office to check on the office ac-
tivities, never say, “Nothing is happening” or “The usual.” By this comment you
are admitting that you are unaware of office activity. You should always be able
to provide a brief summary of activities and incoming telephone calls. Remember,
the office professional is an information worker. Your job is to collect, use, and
provide information.
SCREEN CALLS
Some managers have such heavy demands on their time that their calls must be
screened, and many of those calls must by handled by someone else. If you must
screen calls, probe courteously for information. Respond to the caller yourself or
determine what the caller’s request is and refer the call to someone who can help
him or her.
When screening calls, you are attempting to find out who is calling and what
the caller wants. You might say,
“May I tell Mr. Morton who is calling, please?”
You should never ask a caller bluntly, “Who is calling?” or “Who is this?”
To find out what the caller wants, you might say,“May I tell Mr. Morton what
you are calling about, please?”

You may experience situations when a caller does not give his or her name for
one reason or another. Remember that when screening calls, you want to deter-
mine what the caller wants. Your manager is better prepared to help the caller if
he or she knows the nature of the call. If you cannot obtain the name of the caller
and the nature of business, you have several options, including the following:
• Ask your manager for his or her preference as to how to handle this type
of call; or
• Tell the caller your manager is not available.
Screening calls (1) saves your manager time and (2) assists the caller. The more
you know about your company, the easier your job of screening calls will be.
Never tell a caller, “I don’t know” and leave the caller wondering what to do
next. As mentioned previously, you might say,
“I don’t know the answer to your question, but I will ask Ms. Blanco,” or
“I will need to find out that information. May I call you back in about ten
minutes?”
If you really don’t know, it’s your responsibility to find out or to ask for assis-
tance from someone who does know.
Placing Long-Distance Calls
DOMESTIC LONG-DISTANCE CALLING
As an office professional, you may be required to make long-distance calls within
the United States. If so, you may be given an authorization code for tracking pur-
poses to use when dialing long distance from your office telephone. Long-distance
calls are all calls placed outside the local calling area. The United States and
Canada are divided into more than one hundred telephone areas. Each of these ar-
eas is identified by a three-digit area code, such as 903, called an area code. As you
know, the area code must be used to place all long-distance calls, even within your
own area code range. More than likely, your long-distance calls will be placed to
anyone who answers the called telephone number. For example, suppose you were
asked to call a pharmaceutical company in Seattle, Washington. The charges for
your call begin when the called telephone is answered.
197

Telecommunications
Long-distance calls may be placed either directly or with operator assistance:
Direct-distance dialing (DDD)—Whenever possible, dial your number directly
without the assistance of the operator.
The cost of making a direct call is lower than that of an operator assisted call.
To make a direct long-distance call in the United States from your office telephone,
1. Dial a number—for example, 9—to get an outside line.
2. Dial the access code 1, the area code of the geographic location you are call-
ing, and the seven-digit local number.
Before the number connects you to the person you are calling, you may have
to enter a long-distance access code provided by your company’s administrative
services coordinator. In most areas the number from which you are calling will be
recorded automatically; however, in some areas the operator will intercept to ask
for your number.
Operator-assisted calls—Remember that of all the services offered by tele-
phone companies, those requiring the intervention of a live telephone operator are
the most costly. Therefore, you should always try to use automated services and
avoid operator assistance whenever possible.
When would you need the operator to assist you with making long-distance
calls? There are a variety of instances. These might include
• You wish to speak to a particular person, not just the person who is answering
the telephone.
• You are having difficulty getting through to the destination.
• You wish to reverse the charges.
• You wish to bill a third party. Third-party billing means you don’t want the
charges to be applied to the telephone from which you are calling or the desti-
nation telephone. Rather, you wish to have the charges billed to another tele-
phone number, for example, often your home or business telephone number.
To place long-distance calls requiring operator assistance, use the zero-plus
method. Dial 0, then the area code and the seven-digit local number.After you have
dialed the complete number, a short automated process will start during which you
will have the choice of entering your calling card number or speaking to a live op-
erator for assistance in placing your call.
Many long-distance telephone companies are using a computerized operator.
If you are placing a long-distance call and wish to use a special service such as re-
versing the charges, dial 0, the area code, and the local number. A computer-
controlled voice will ask you which service you want, and then ask you to state
your name clearly. When the call is placed, the computer-controlled voice system
announces your name and the fact that you wish to reverse the charges or acti-
vate one of the other special services available. When you wish to reverse the
charges, the person on the receiving end will accept or refuse the charges either
by keying in a response on the telephone pad or by responding to questions with
a simple “yes” or “no.” All of this takes place without the intervention of a life
operator.
CALLING CARD CALLS
Telephone calling cards are sometimes given to employees for expense purposes.
These employees are expected to use calling cards when they travel, rather than
claiming each individual long-distance telephone call on their expense accounts.
198

Telecommunications
Telephone calling cards may or may not require the assistance of an operator. Most
pay phones are equipped with a magnetic strip reader to accommodate telephone
calling cards. When you use a calling card for placing a call, the charge is auto-
matically billed to your personal or business account. Some services providers add
a surcharge to the cost of each call that is made using your calling card. The in-
formation stored on the card includes a coded account number so the calls can be
tracked.
Prepaid calling cards are set up in the same way as direct debit cards. The
magnetic stripe on the back of a prepaid card stores the original purchase value of
the card and updates (debits) that amount each time a call is made. Pay telephone
equipment can read and update a prepaid calling card as the call progresses. Pre-
paid calling cards are available in different denominations; you can purchase cards
with values of $5, $10, or $20, for example.
DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE CALLS
Depending on your company telecommunication policy, calls to directory assis-
tance may be restricted for cost control reasons. In some companies, directory as-
sistance calls are not allowed unless authorized by the administrative services
manager or the telecommunication manager. Normally telephone number infor-
mation is accessed by dialing outside your company’s telephone system to get an
outside line and then dialing 411 or 1411.
If you want to call long distance but don’t know the number of the party you
want to reach, you need to access directory assistance. Similar to accessing direc-
tory assistance for local calls, dial 1, the area code of the geographic location you
want, and 555-1212. You will reach the information operator, or the automated
directory system for the area you are calling. First provide the name of the city or
town you want and then the name of the person. Write down the number that is
given to you and hang up. Then dial 1, the area code, and the seven-digit number
provided by the operator. This same procedure is used whether you are dialing in-
side or outside your area code.
Your department may be charged for this service whether you request a num-
ber inside or outside your area code. (Refer to the introductory pages of your tele-
phone directory to determine how to request local directory assistance.)
You don’t need to call for directory assistance to locate a telephone area code.
As you have learned, you can access the Internet. This search produces a number
of options from which to choose; however, be aware of any listing that charges
a fee.
TELEPHONE CONFERENCE CALLS
A telephone conference call takes place when three or more telephone stations are
connected across a network that supports the conversation (Figure 3). Telephone
conference calls can be initiated by:
• prearranging a call through a telephone operator;
• using the special “conference” feature on a telephone.
Before arranging for a conference call, be certain you are familiar with your
company’s procedures for setting up this type of call.
199

FIGURE 3 • Team on a conference call.
U.S. TIME ZONES
When you are placing a long-distance call, know the time zone of the city you are
calling. For instance, when it is 4:30 p.m. in Kansas City, you can anticipate of-
fices in New York City will be closed. When it is 5 p.m. in Kansas City, offices on
the West Coast will still be open.
The United States is divided into five time zones:
• Atlantic;
• Eastern;
• Central;
• Mountain;
• Pacific.
From east to west, the time in each zone is one hour earlier than the time in
the adjacent time zone. The time and location where the call originates determine
what long-distance rates apply.
INTERNATIONAL CALLING
Although the process may vary from country to country and from city to city within
a country, there are generally two ways to make international calls. You may dial di-
rectly or use an international operator.
• If you choose to dial directly, simply dial:
011  country code  city code  local number

Note: The actual number of digits for each category can vary by country or city.
Country code is the national prefix to be used when dialing to that particular coun-
try from another country.In some cases you will also need to dial a city or area code.
• If you use an international operator, dial:
01  country code  city code  local number
Placing International Calls Without Realizing It
It’s not always easy to tell if you’re dialing an international telephone number. In
most cases, you have to dial 011 to begin a call to a foreign country. But there are
locations outside the United States where telephone numbers may look like do-
mestic long-distance calls but are actually international calls charged at interna-
tional rates. For example, calls placed to Canada and the Caribbean countries are
charged at international rates, even though it may seem that you are making a do-
mestic long-distance call by dialing 1  the area code  the phone number.
Long-distance international telephone country codes are listed in most tele-
phone directories but are subject to change without notice. Using the Internet, you
can search for current international telephone country codes. Here is a small sam-

Time Zones Around the World
The world is divided into twenty-four time zones, which are based on degrees of
longitude. The zones are one hour apart in time. Greenwich, England, is recog-
nized as the prime meridian of longitude; in other words, standard time is calcu-
lated from Greenwich, England. The Greenwich zone is called the zero zone
because the difference between standard time and Greenwich Mean Time is zero.
Each of the zones in turn is designated by a number representing the number of
hours by which the standard time of the zone differs from Greenwich Mean Time.
The United States and its possessions are divided into eight standard time zones,
established by Congress with the adoption of the Uniform Time Act of 1966. The
time zones are Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, Alaska, and
Hawaii/Aleutian. The time in these zones is earlier than Greenwich by four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, and eleven hours, respectively.
If you need to determine time in cities around the globe, access the Internet and
search for international time zones.
Developing Effective Telephone Techniques
The purpose of this section is to enhance telephone communication between you
and the customer. You have probably experienced poor etiquette on the telephone
and know this can be a frustrating experience. The following techniques should
assist you in serving your callers in appropriate, positive ways.
BE COURTEOUS
Can you think of a time when someone was rude, short, or indifferent to you on
the telephone? How did you feel? What impact did it make on you? What im-
pression do you have now of that person? Product or service? Company? Lead-
ers of companies expect their employees to be courteous so they will not irritate
or even lose customers. Being courteous means you demonstrate good manners,
202

Telecommunications
politeness, and diplomacy. Here are some suggestions to follow to demonstrate
courteousness.
• Authorities do not agree on whether a greeting such as “Good morning” and
“Good afternoon” should be used when answering the telephone. Nevertheless,
a greeting is a courtesy. As well, many callers do not hear the name of the orga-
nization if it is the first word spoken when a telephone is answered. Use the most
appropriate greeting for your organization.
• Listen actively. As you have learned earlier in this chapter, listening is an essen-
tial element in effective telephone use. If the caller interrupts you, permit the
caller to talk. Do not, however, permit the caller to complete a long explanation
if the caller has reached the wrong office. You should interrupt by saying,
“Excuse me, I believe you should speak to someone in the ____________ De-
partment. The number for that department is ____________. Would you like me
to transfer you?”
• When you must leave the line to obtain information, explain why and how long
it will take. Give the caller a choice: Ask whether the caller would prefer (1) to
wait or (2) to be called back. If the caller chooses to wait, avoid a wait of more
than two minutes. When you return to the caller who is holding, offer your
thanks for waiting.
When searching for information takes longer than one minute, check with the
caller and let him or her know you are still looking for the information.
• During telephone conversations, use “please,” “thank you,” and other courte-
ous phrases. At appropriate times, use the caller’s name.
• When the caller has dialed the wrong number, be especially courteous. Callers
often reach a wrong number because they have looked at the wrong number on
a list of frequently called numbers. The caller may be one of your current or fu-
ture customers.
• The person who initiates a telephone call should terminate it. However, you can
bring the call to an end by thanking the person for calling or suggesting that you
will give the message to your manager, or whatever is appropriate. When you
initiate the call, let the other person know that you are going to leave the line.
Do not end abruptly.You may close with “Good-bye”or “Bye.”“Bye-bye”is too
familiar, so avoid it.
BE CONSIDERATE WHEN USING SPEAKERPHONES
The speakerphone feature on many telephone systems allows hands-free phone
conversations, eliminating the risk of any discomfort or injury associated with im-
proper phone use. Although using this feature offers an advantage, it has practi-
cal limitations: the speakerphone generally does not work well in a noisy
environment or for confidential conversations, and can sometimes reduce the
sound quality of the conversation. When using the speakerphone, use the follow-
ing suggestions:
• Let the other person or group of people know you are using your speakerphone
feature.
• Ask the person if the reception is clear before you begin any conversation.
• Let the person know who else is in the room.
• Avoid shuffling papers or moving items on your desk because the speakerphone
is sensitive to noise.

HANDLE ANGRY CALLERS
When handling angry callers, it is important to know and remember that anger is
a secondary emotion. This means that when the caller is angry, he or she is usually
not mad at you—so don’t take it personally. Some other emotion, called a primary
emotion, always precedes anger, even though you may not be aware of it. Specifi-
cally, before the caller feels angry, he or she perceives a threat of a loss or an actual
loss of something that is important.
People often cover up primary emotions in order to defend or protect them-
selves. The negative primary emotions (e.g., disappointment, confusion, pressure)
do not feel good, so to relieve the discomfort, people use secondary emotions (like
irritation and anger) to shift the focus from themselves to others, usually blaming
or criticizing them.
As an office professional, you must respond in a professional manner regard-
less of the caller’s behavior. No matter what happens, avoid the following:
• hastily and/or unnecessarily transferring an angry caller to an unsuspecting
coworker;
• ignoring an angry customer while he or she “talks it out and calms down”;
• telling an angry caller, “Calm down” or “Don’t be upset”;
• Promising to call back and then either failing to do so or allowing three or four
days to pass without returning the call.
Here are some tips to use when handling an angry caller:
1. Deal with the feelings first.
a. Show understanding.
b. Provide feedback.
c. Summarize the situation.
2. Deal with the situation.
a. Find out what the caller wants.
b. If it is not possible to do what the person wants, suggest alternatives.
c. Share information.
d. Agree on a solution.
e. Follow up.
RETURN TELEPHONE CALLS PROMPTLY
Become the person who has a reputation for returning telephone calls in a timely
manner. Establish a procedure for returning calls. Remember to apply the tech-
nique for grouping tasks when returning calls. For example, you may want to
group returning several calls at one time prior to lunch and again before you leave
work in the evening. Become aware of your routine callers’ habits, so you can de-
termine the best times in which to return calls. To return your calls promptly, you
must check your messages frequently.
CHECK YOUR MESSAGES FREQUENTLY
People may be trying to contact you or your manager to provide information or ask
questions so they can resolve a situation. If you are away from your office on a reg-
ular basis, develop a routine for checking your messages frequently. For instance,
204

Telecommunications
when you arrive in the morning, check your system for telephone messages. If you
have attended several meetings during the morning, check your messages prior to
lunch. Be certain to check your messages again in the afternoon so you will be able
to return the calls prior to leaving for the day or early the next morning.
AVOID TELEPHONE TAG
Although the use of e-mail has increased, people still continue to use the telephone
and should do so, depending on the situation. However, people play telephone tag,
phoning back and forth trying to reach each other without success. Reduce
time spent missing each other and increase your productivity by following these
suggestions:
1. If possible, gain enough information from your manager to learn of his or her
availability. For example, if you and your manager can view each other’s elec-
tronic calendar, you can check his or her availability.
2. Consider other options: If the telephone tag continues, try sending an e-mail
or fax.
3. Determine if you can locate information for another person or from another
source rather than waiting on the person you have been trying to call for the
past two or three days.

Telephone Technology
Though much of this chapter’s topics have been dedicated to the interpersonal na-
ture of telephone communications, office professionals must become knowledge-
able about the technology of telecommunications.Advances in telecommunications
have had a tremendous impact on how employees communicate with their
managers, coworkers, and customers. These advances include telephone systems
with automated routing units, answering services and machines, and cellular
telephones.
AUTOMATIC ROUTING UNITS
Many offices have automated routing unit (ARU) telephone systems to handle heavy
telephone traffic. The system answers the call, and a recorded voice identifies
205

Telecommunications
departments or services the caller can access by pressing a specified number on the
touch-tone telephone.
Some automated telephone systems have electronic mailboxes so the caller can
leave a message if the person they are calling is unavailable. In many systems, the
caller is prompted through a menu of options to acquire information. If the caller
does not select an option, the call is directed to a live operator.
ANSWERING SERVICES AND MACHINES
Answering services are attended by a live operator who responds to subscribers’
telephones at designated hours. The operator takes messages, records numbers to
be called, and judges whether or not to reach the subscriber during after-business
hours. An example of a subscriber is a doctor whose calls are answered after reg-
ular hours by telephone answering services.
With an answering machine, a user can turn on a recorded message at the end
of the business day. The message might tell callers when the office will be open, its
location, and invite them to leave their number or a message. Sometimes, cus-
tomers are encouraged to place orders after hours by leaving their requests on the
automatic recording machine.
MESSAGING
Two popular methods of communicating in the workplace are instant messaging
and text messaging. Can you imagine using instant messaging to talk simultane-
ously with coworkers and customers? Instant messaging (IM) is a type of com-
munications service that allows you to create a private chat room to communicate
in real time over the Internet. Typically, the instant messaging system alerts you
when someone on your private list is online. Before using IM, check with your su-
pervisor for approval. Find out whether your organization has a policy about us-
ing IM. Text messaging involves sending short messages usually to a wireless
device such as a cell phone or personal digital assistant (PDA).
CELLULAR SERVICE
Cellular (cell) telephones are everywhere. They offer convenient and flexible com-
munication. For example, you are attending a seminar for two days and want to
check your telephone messages. So during the afternoon break of the first day, you
use your cell telephone to retrieve your messages. Suppose your manager has been
delayed in arriving for his meeting scheduled in a conference room on your floor
and has called you to deliver a message to the group who has already gathered.
As the technology has provided this convenience, it has also created issues. For
instance, you see visitors who enter the lobby of your building still carrying on
conversations on their cell phones. When you get on the elevator to go to lunch,
you say hello to your coworker who is on her cell phone talking with her manager
about an office issue that should never have been made public.
With all the technology available at the touch of a button, it is important to
address cell telephone etiquette. Here are a few guidelines to follow:
• Never talk in public places, such as elevators, restaurants, churches, and libraries.
• Don’t use loud and annoying tones.
• Never accept calls while you are in a meeting, in an interview, or in a doctor’s office.
206

Telecommunications
• Unless you are waiting on an emergency call, do not place your cell phone on
your desk. Allow your manager to see you concentrate on your job tasks, not
on your incoming personal telephone calls.
VOICE MAIL
• Voice mail is a computer-based system that processes both incoming and outgo-
ing telephone calls. Special computer chips and software convert the human voice
into a digital recording that can be stored in the computer.The recording can then
be retrieved at any time for playback. Today, voice mail is a common method of
messaging. Depending on the system, voice mail can help in the following ways:
• Voice mail ensures that no calls are missed.
• Messages can be sent regardless of time zones or work schedules.
• Office professionals can leave messages for anyone who has an access code.
For example, if you are out of the office and want to leave details of a sched-
uled meeting, you can give those invited your access code and leave a de-
scriptive voice mail message.
• Voice mail allows messages to be recorded and saved in a mailbox. A voice
mail system can also forward messages to another location or to other
coworkers.
• Voice mail messages can be sent to a number of people simultaneously.
• Voice mail can also serve as an automated telephone operator by answering
calls with a standard recording.
Voice mail also handles telephone messages quickly and efficiently and, if used cor-
rectly, may eliminate the annoying practice of telephone tag.
However, voice mail has some disadvantages:
• Callers forced to listen to long messages can find the system annoying.
• Voice mail also delivers the implicit message that the caller’s time is less valu-
able than the recipient’s.
• Some users do not access their mailboxes regularly.
• The recipient does not know when a message comes in unless the system has a
signaling feature.
Because voice mail can be delivered as a public telephone network service, tele-
phone companies provide many sophisticated voice mail features as a service. For
example, voice mail can help employers deal with diversity in the workforce. The
local telephone company can provide voice mail services in several different
languages. A company’s voice mail language of choice will provide access for
employees and customers to the company’s voice mail without encountering a
language barrier.
Although voice mail lacks the richness of direct communications, here are
some fundamental practices that should be considered to improve voice mail
interactions:
1. Consider stating and changing the date of your greeting message on a daily
basis. Doing so provides the caller with information that you are, in fact, in
touch with your voice mail system.
2. Record an appropriate announcement on your greeting message when leav-
ing for vacation or other extended periods when you will not be checking
your voice mail for incoming messages.
207

Telecommunications
3. When leaving messages for others, state your name and phone number
clearly and at a slow enough pace for note taking.
4. State your message clearly and concisely.
5. Specify the action you wish to occur.
6. Indicate when you will be available to receive a return call.
7. Consider the tone of voice and impression you are leaving with your message.
8. Avoid leaving lengthy messages.
The features and functions of voice mail systems are improving rapidly. It must be
noted that unless used correctly, the voice mail system can annoy and frustrate
callers, with the result that business suffers. It is essential to put appropriate pro-
cedures in place when using voice mail.
The following three practices will help minimize caller frustration:
1. Make it possible for the caller to speak to a representative of the company,
in addition to being able to leave a message on the voice mail system.
2. Introduce organizational procedures for responding to voice mail to resolve
the problem of messages not being collected or not being answered.
3. Ensure that employees are fully trained to use the voice mail message system.
When a system fails to meet its objectives, it is often because of inadequate
staff training.
Just as technology is transforming office procedures, it is having a similar impact
on telephone messaging. Voice mail and electronic meetings offer office profes-
sionals tools for conducting more productive conversations and meetings.
COMMON TELEPHONE EQUIPMENT
Two types of telephone equipment in the workplace are the touch-tone telephones
and key telephones.
Touch-Tone Telephones
Most regular telephones are touch-tone activated. The touch-tone telephone
provides both regular telephone service and tone transmission of data through a
twelve-button keypad. Ten buttons represent the numbers 0 through 9 and the
alphabet. The other two buttons, showing the # and the * symbols, generate
unique tones that may be connected to special telephone company services. An
example of such a service is repeat dial, which will redial the last number used.
Key Telephones
Key telephones, or keysets, provide flexibility in making and receiving multiple
calls simultaneously. Key telephones have multiple buttons, and the buttons on
one phone set are the same as those on the other sets in an office. A number
of calls from both inside and outside the office may be made or received
simultaneously.
The basic key telephone is a regular telephone with push-button keys corre-
sponding to the number of telephone lines terminating in the telephone.
• The push buttons flash on and off to indicate incoming calls on the lines.
208

Telecommunications
• To answer a call, push the key that is flashing and
lift the receiver.
• If a second call comes in while the first is in
progress, suspend the conversation properly,
push the hold button, then push the flashing key
of the incoming call and answer the call.
• To suspend this call and get back to the first call,
push the hold button again and push the key of
the first incoming call.
• When a push-button key glows steadily, it indi-
cates that the line is in use.
Figure 4 shows a key telephone with an add-on
module that allows moretelephone lines to be used.
Other features can enhance your telephone ef-
fectiveness. For example:
• By touching a predefined button, the office assis-
tant may speed-dial a number.
• By pressing a key, a previously dialed number
may be redialed.
• Most telephone systems provide electronic mem-
ory where names and numbers are stored. With
the electronic memory feature, frequently used
numbers may be recorded and reused for dialing
automatically and accurately.

Ethics and the Telephone
Workplace ethics is partly based on core values, such as honesty, respect, and trust,
but can be learned directly from the actions of others. For example, what people
see their company executives, managers, and coworkers do in the workplace can
influence their own views of what is acceptable or unacceptable behavior.
Consider Reeshemah’s example. Reeshemah works for a small company that
doesn’t have a formal ethics program; however, she sees the company’s leaders and
supervisors modeling ethical behavior and sees the core values applied frequently
at work. In the past few months, she has recognized questionable behavior by her
immediate team leader. For example, her team leader has a friend working in
Madrid and periodically calls her from work for lengthy chats. She has started ask-
ing Reeshemah to place the calls for her since she might have to try several times
before reaching her friend, and she wants to avoid that. Both Reeshemah and her
team leader know that the company does not allow long-distance personal calls at
company expense or on company time. However, her team leader tells Reeshemah
it’s okay because the company has a business associate in Madrid, so they will
never know. Reeshemah feels uncomfortable about placing the calls and also
about reporting this misconduct.
Situations such as this one can become very uncomfortable for workers, par-
ticularly when the request is made by a supervisor. Although her team leader tells
her otherwise, Reeshemah knows that placing personal calls using company re-
sources is unethical. When you use company time and telephone accounts for per-
sonal use against company policy, formal or informal, you are “stealing” resources
from them, just as surely as if you had taken money from their petty cash box for
your personal use.
Reeshemah faces a dilemma shared by other workers who are placed in simi-
lar situations. They recognize behaviors that are unethical, but, for a number of
reasons, they are concerned about refusing to cooperate and also about reporting
the misconduct. Their reluctance may be a result of
• the belief that management and coworkers will see them as “informers”;
• the company’s negative response when misconduct was reported in the past;
• fear of retaliation, either from a supervisor or coworker.
Unfortunately, you are responsible for your actions, and unethical conduct in
the workplace can have serious repercussions, including loss of job, not to men-
tion loss of self-esteem. Ask yourself, “Would my employer approve of this ac-
tion?” If the answer is “no,” decline taking part in the unethical behavior. Tactfully
say that you feel uncomfortable about making the call (in Reeshemah’s case) be-
cause you know it is against company policy.
If there is no formal ethics policy at your workplace, approach your em-
ployer and offer to help draft a policy. You will feel you have not compromised
your values and in the long term, likely will gain respect from coworkers and
employers.
Many more telephone features are gaining popularity as enhancements to
productivity such as bilingual displays and voice communication over the
Internet. New developments include bilingual alphanumeric displays. Refer to
Figure 4.

Making International Telephone Calls
Telephones are easy to use, but some people tend to panic when an international
call does not go through immediately. When something goes wrong, you ask your-
self questions such as:
• Why did a fax sound come on when I expected to hear a person answering the
phone? Perhaps you have a number that is intended for a fax line or the desti-
nation receiver has the telephone connected to the fax line.
• Why is there no answer at the company I am calling? Perhaps the difference in
time zones means that it is after hours in the location you are calling. Perhaps
the country you are calling is observing a national holiday or has a midday
extended siesta built into the workday.
• What do I do now that an unexpected person is answering the phone in a lan-
guage I don’t understand? Perhaps you should hang up and dial using an inter-
national operator who is trained in the language. Perhaps you can ask to speak
to someone who speaks English.
• Why did someone in Minnesota answer the phone when I was dialing Sydney,
Australia? Perhaps the area code is incorrect, or perhaps the country code
wasn’t dialed.
When making international calls, be sure to check the following:
• your own office phone system;
• correct format for dialing international numbers;
• international holidays;
• time zone differences;
• language barriers.
Quick Tips
PROFESSIONALISM IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS
When answering the telephone:
• Convey a message of sincerity to help; don’t leave the
impression that the call is an interruption.
• Present a responsible attitude; forward calls to appropriate
person in the office who is more specialized in the callers’
questions and follow up to see situation was resolved.
• Avoid personal telephone calls, text messaging, and e-mails
during working hours.
• Never eat or chew gum while answering the telephone.
• Don’t use acronyms for your company’s name—unless it’s a
very well-known company like AT&T or IBM.
• Avoid other “shorthand,” such as “IS, this is Sue, may I help
you?” This greeting may not be clear if the caller doesn’t know
IS stands for Information Systems.

tory to determine how the following are classified:
educational services (public schools, private schools,
colleges and universities); food catering services;
medical doctors (general practitioners); furniture for
an office, office stationery; office computers; and
airlines. Prepare a list in memo form and submit it to
your instructor.
2. With your team, review the following comments re-
garding messages that have been provided to

“I don’t know where he is . . .”
“No one told me where she is . . .”
“She left early today.”
“He took the afternoon off.”
3. Make multiple telephone calls this coming week and
evaluate how well individuals receive the calls by an-
swering these questions.
a. Did the person answer the telephone within
five or six rings?
b. Did the person identify himself or herself by
using a greeting, company name or department
name, and own name?
c. If leaving a message, did the person ask for
enough information to record a complete
message?
d. If a transfer call was necessary, was the transfer
completed efficiently? Were you given a
telephone number of the office where the call
was being transferred?
e. If needed, did the person screen the call
properly?
f. Was the person helpful in concluding the
call efficiently?
Prepare your responses along with the questions and
submit your report to your instructor.

1. Improving rapport. During your first job perfor-
mance review, you were criticized for the way you
answered the telephone. You had been asking the
caller to state the purpose of the call before you said
whether your manager was in the office. After you
found out who the caller was and the purpose of the
call, you sometimes said, “Mrs. Burke is not in her
office,” or “Mrs. Burke is in a meeting.” It was true
Mrs. Burke was not in her office when you said this,
but apparently the callers were not convinced. What
can you do to improve rapport with callers?
2. Delivering a message. You know your manager,
Mr. Perkins, is expecting an important long-distance
call. He called Mike Williams at 9:30 a.m., and he is
expecting Mr. Williams to return his call. At 4:30
p.m. Mr. Perkins was called to the president’s office.
A few minutes after Mr. Perkins left his office,
Mr.Williams called.You feel you should not interrupt
Mr.Perkins.You do not know whether Mr.Perkins will
return to his desk before 5 p.m.What should you do?

3. Answering calls for others. Robert started working
in your department one week ago. His job includes
answering the telephone at his workstation. As you
are the assistant to the department manager and the
person responsible for telephone training, you have
noticed Robert has made the following comments:
“Who is this?” “Call back later,” “She is still at
lunch,” and “Hold on.” What should you do? What
suggestions should you make? What additional
training do you think is needed?
4. Receiving personal calls. You have noticed that
Lauren spends a great deal of time on the telephone
for personal calls. She leaves her desk frequently and
transfers her calls to your workstation.You really do
not mind taking her calls, but a majority of her in-
coming calls have been personal ones. What should
you do? List several alternatives for handling the sit-

Ms. Quevedo asked you to place several telephone calls.
Here is Ms. Quevedo’s conversation with you:
“Mr. Arnett, (303) 366-8184, who was sched-
uled to speak at the November Sales Seminar on
Wednesday, November 12, at 10 a.m., cannot at-
tend on Wednesday. He is handling his manager’s
work as his manager has had a heart attack and
will not return to work for at least six months.
Mr. Arnett must be in the office on November
12. He can, however, attend the seminar on
Monday and Tuesday.
“Find a speaker who can trade times with
Mr. Arnett. Call James Yates, 674-8609, who is
scheduled to talk at 2 p.m. Monday. If he can’t
do it, ask Ruth Agway, (608) 547-3232, who is
scheduled to speak at 11 a.m. Monday. Another
possibility is Ray Morris, 638-1456, who is on a
panel on Tuesday afternoon.
“Be sure to call Mr. Arnett and tell him what
arrangements you have made.
“Be sure to make the proper notations in the
official copy of the program. It would be a good
idea to write a confirmation letter to the person
whose time has changed.”
Note: When you called Mr.Yates, he said he could not at-
tend the seminar on Wednesday.
Before you place any calls, make notes on what you
need to say. Record all essential information, such as
names, telephone numbers, dates, and time of day. Also
write down reminders about what you need to do after you
have found someone who can trade times with Mr. Arnett.

Building Communications Skills
E
ffective communication is the responsibility of every person in the organiza-
tion. Your ability to communicate with coworkers, supervisors, customers, or
clients can enhance your effectiveness or damage it. As an office professional,
you will be expected to have excellent verbal, nonverbal, and written communica-
tion skills in both the electronic and personal realm.
Examining the Communication Process
Because employees spend the greater part of their time in some type of interper-
sonal situation, estimated to be as much as 75 percent of the time, effective com-
munication is an essential component of the company’s success. The function of
communication is to ensure that every employee knows what he or she is expected
to do, that the right person receives the correct information, and that all activities
within the organization are coordinated. Effective communication ensures that the
company’s plans and procedures as well as manager’s instructions are understood.
When this process works smoothly, group and team cooperation is assured and
stress is reduced.
COMMUNICATION METHODS
Experts say communication is composed of different methods: verbal (by words
and voice); interactive, mobile, and instant (by computer and telephone); written
(by letter, e-mail memo, or report); and nonverbal (by body language). Of these,
some are more effective in delivering a message than others. Various studies tell us
that in a conversation or verbal exchange:
Words are 7–10% effective.
Tone of voice is 38–40% effective.
Nonverbal clues are 45–50% effective.
How effective your communication is depends as much on how you say it as on
what you say. Also, whether your message is understood depends on the method
of communication you choose to use to deliver it.
Verbal Communication
Verbal communication can mean a telephone conversation, a voice mail message, a
formal meeting, or even an informal chat with a coworker at lunch (see Figure 1).
Much of the communication in an office is verbal. The most effective verbal com-
munication takes place in a comfortable atmosphere on a one-to-one basis. A per-
son can inspire, energize, or even convince others by helping them grasp exciting
mental pictures of the topic being discussed. Effective verbal skills can be learned.
You should strive to continually improve these skills.
When communicating verbally with another person, follow these guidelines to
speak with confidence:
• Listen and watch for verbal and nonverbal feedback. Many factors affect how
someone reacts to what you are saying. Among them is past experience—what
happened to that person in a similar situation.
• Choose your words carefully when the topic you are discussing is sensitive or
controversial. You may wish to withhold your opinion entirely if you know your
224

Building Communications Skills

view will offend the listener, put the listener on the defensive, or force the listener
to disagree with you.
• Encourage the other person to talk; communication should be a two-way street.
Communication will be open and honest if the person trusts you; it will be
restricted if the person does not.
• Give the other person your undivided attention. Performing another task while
you are talking is distracting and rude. Paying attention to what is said applies
to anyone you talk to face-to-face as well.
• Avoid talking incessantly. Pause often to give your listener an opportunity to
respond.
• Summarize the important points in logical order and give the listener a chance
to ask questions at the end of a conversation. Communication does not take
place until the listener truly understands what you are saying.
The words you use when you speak tell others about your verbal skills. Your
speech should show you have carefully developed a general aptitude and accumu-
lated knowledge of word meanings and relationships. The best way to build your
vocabulary is to read widely and work steadily to improve these skills.Figure 2 iden-
tifies some common mispronounced words and phrases in English. You can avoid
making such errors simply by being aware of the correct pronunciation of words
and practicing each time you speak.
Interactive, Mobile, and Instant Communication
Speeding up the flow of information is becoming more and more important in
business. Technologies that provide instant communication such as e-mail, instant
messaging (IM), text messaging, voice mail, cell phones, and wireless networks are
common. Even though an office professional might not use many of these commu-
nication technologies on the job, they are having a profound effect on how quickly
information is sent. For instance, your supervisor may use his or her cell phone,
laptop, or handheld device to send and receive messages.

Building Communications Skills
Ten Ways to Improve Your Verbal Communications
✓Avoid saying “uh,” or “You know?” or some such repeti-
tious phrase. Some people use uh when they are stopping to
think what they will say next. This pause gives them time to
think. A person once said, “I counted 104 ‘uhs’ in another per-
son’s message.” I doubt if they heard any of what the person
was saying otherwise. “Know what I mean?” is a habit and an
example of another common ineffective repetitious phrase. Be
careful not to pick up the habit of using these phrases.
✓Slow your speech. When you talk fast, you may appear to be
nervous and unsure of yourself.
✓Don’t talk in a monotone. Inflection helps convey meaning.
When you want to make a point or emphasize something, put a
dip in your voice by lowering it briefly. Raising your voice
slightly at the end of a statement makes it a question.
✓Don’t speak loudly. If you are standing close to someone,keep
your volume down. Increase your volume depending on the
distance from the person. Don’t, however, speak so softly your
listener has to ask you to repeat what you are saying.
✓Speak clearly. Don’t mumble. When you hear “Huh?” that is a
warning you are not speaking clearly.
✓Use the correct word. An example of misusing a word is “The
speaker spoke in a monochrome voice,” when the person
meant “The speaker spoke in a monotone voice.” Others will
question your competence if you incorrectly use words.
✓Use the right word. If you aren’t sure of a word’s meaning,
don’t use it.
✓Always use eye contact. When you don’t look the person in
the eye as you speak, the other person may view you as ap-
pearing to be shy, unsure of yourself, or incompetent. Remem-
ber, though, eye contact is considered disrespectful in some
cultures.
✓Use gestures. Your body language should show the listener
you are interested in speaking with him or her. Be careful not to
overdo it; but do show a little animation when speaking with
someone.
✓Smile occasionally. A smile shows that you are interested in
what is being said and that you are a friendly, enjoyable per-
son. Of course, some circumstances do not call for a smile,
such as when the speaker is upset or when the occasion is a
sad one.
Written Communication
Written communication is just as important today as it ever has been. The rules
that apply to letters and reports also apply to e-mail and instant messages.You will
learn more about written communications later in this chapter.
Nonverbal Communication
Most people are skilled at communicating a message without speaking even one word.
Using nonverbal communications, our facial expressions, body gestures, and the way
we dress often express our feelings and opinions better than our spoken words. Make
certain the receiver doesn’t misinterpret what is often seen as subtle nonverbal cues.
It is imperative that your actions convey a clear meaning—that is, the meaning you

intend. Verbal communication can be completely discredited by its nonverbal coun-
terpart. The following are ways people use to interpret nonverbal meanings:
• Image. It is no surprise that the way you dress creates an image to others and sends
a message to customers and colleagues. Conservative dress conveys the message
that you are a professional and want to be taken seriously. Make sure you are
dressed presentably even on “casual Fridays” that many companies allow.
• Personal space. Everyone has expectations about personal space. Personal space
refers to the distance at which one person feels comfortable talking to another.
People who stand too close are viewed as aggressive or perhaps overfriendly;
people who stand too far away may be seen as aloof. Always be considerate and
do not violate another’s personal space.
• Eye contact. In U.S. culture, a person shows confidence and interest with eye
contact by looking directly into someone else’s eyes when speaking with him or her.
Eyes are one of the most important nonverbal language tools. We use our eyes to
read the other person’s body language and, in turn, our eyes convey nonverbal
messages. In other cultures, direct eye contact can make a person feel uncomfort-
able or even threatened; in such situations, avoid prolonged direct eye contact.
• Posture. Your posture, the way you stand, sit, and walk, tells others a story and
can convey your level of confidence. By leaning toward someone you show at-
tentiveness; likewise, leaning away can show lack of interest and some level of
reserve. When you hunch your shoulders and keep your head down, it appears
you have low self-confidence. When you puff yourself up, you may be showing
aggression. Remember your posture may not be telling the story you intend to
tell, so be cautious about how your posture is perceived. A relaxed body pos-
ture will help you appear and feel more relaxed and confident.
• Facial expressions. The face is the most expressive part of the body. It is capable
of many expressions that reflect our attitudes and emotions. In fact, the face
speaks a universal language. Many cultures share the same expressions of hap-
piness, fear, anger, or sadness. Others interpret your meanings from your facial
expressions. You can break a misrepresentation of appearing aloof, disapprov-
ing, or disinterested, by simply smiling. Your smile is the strongest nonverbal
tool you have. It can help you appear warm, open, friendly, and confident. Be
aware of the impact this powerful nonverbal tool can have.
Because nonverbal language is far more powerful than verbal communication,
it is imperative that you pay attention to the messages your body language sends.
It gives signals about your interest in someone or something, your openness, and
attentiveness. Nonverbal language tells others what is going on inside of us. Smil-
ing, making eye contact, using open gestures, and using good posture can project
self-confidence. Being aware of your body language can help you send a consistent
message. Figure 3 identifies some crazy phrases and sayings related to body lan-
guage that have slipped into our vocabulary.
OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO COMMUNICATION
Anything that prevents understanding of a message is a barrier to communication.

Crazy Phrases and Sayings Related to Body Language
Have you ever heard someone say,“I don’t trust those beady eyes,” or “He is so standoffish”? Have you ever wondered what these
crazy phrases mean? Here are some interpretations without any scientific basis for each meaning.
Phrase
Meaning
“Beady little eyes”
The pupils unconsciously constrict when we are lying or being deceitful.
“Gets under my skin”
You feel your hair slightly raise; for instance, when you are uncomfortable around
a certain person, or conversational topic or tone.
“Opening up to you”
When someone displays open gestures (e.g., uncrossed arms and legs) talking
more freely with you and showing a feeling of trust. Open gestures demonstrate
trust.
“Pain in the neck”
When something is not to our liking.
“Pushy”
When someone keeps on insisting about a matter or thing and continues to talk
about it even when we have asked the person not to do so.
“Shifty eyes”
When the person looks away and avoids meeting the other person’s eyes, they
may be lying.
“Sparkle in the eyes”
The pupils unconsciously dilate when we see something we like; this action
allows more light to be reflected off the back of the eye.
“Standoffish”
When a person stands a little too far away from us and makes us uncomfortable
because they are outside our personal zone. Or, when a person does not connect
with the group, he or she is considered to be standoffish.
“Stand on your own two feet”
When we need to stop expecting the other person to help us or bail us out when
we are in trouble. We must take responsibility for our own actions.
“Under the thumb”
When a person thinks he or she is controlled by another person.
FIGURE 3 • Crazy phrases and sayings related to body language.
of the reasons might be the following: Too much
information was sent, so the receiver missed key
points; perhaps the language was too difficult;
the method used to send the message was
flawed; or the recipient, for whatever reason,
failed to listen carefully or perhaps had bias
against the sender. Reasons for the breakdown
in communications are often many. What is im-
portant is that you recognize barriers and at-
tempt to remove them.
Let’s say your supervisor told you to remind
him to call a client “about 2 p.m.” To you that
meant 2 p.m., but the supervisor really meant
1:45 p.m. The supervisor assumed you thor-
oughly understood his meaning. Remember the
sender and receiver of the message must make

the same assumptions. To avoid a misunderstanding, the receiver could ask for
clarification (“Do you mean right at 2 p.m.?”) or the sender could be more spe-
cific (“Remind me a little before 2, say at 1:45”). When in doubt, explain what is
meant in detail to avoid missing the meaning.
Differing Interpretations
Interpreting a person’s meaning differently than he or she meant it is another com-
mon barrier. Each person is unique. No other person in the world is exactly like
you.You are unique in that your experiences, education, culture, expectations, per-
sonality, and many other elements make up who you are. How you interpret some-
thing, such as an upcoming project that will require a lot of work, may be different
from how another person interprets it. You may be positive, excited, or eager. A
coworker who will be working on the project with you may approach it with
dread, anxiety, and as too much work to handle. Because you must work together,
these differences can cause a barrier to communication. You must seek to under-
stand each other’s views to avoid this barrier.
Using Unfamiliar Words
Another barrier to communication is being unfamiliar with the meaning of certain
words. Using words unfamiliar to the other person prevents him or her from un-
derstanding your message. You must make sure you consider the receiver’s level of
language skills. Speaking or writing using the appropriate level of language skills
for your audience can help avoid this barrier.
Emotional or Physical Distractions
Emotional and physical distractions can affect effective communications. How
one feels or physical distractions such as faulty acoustics, poor lighting, or bright
colors can affect a person’s mood. Make sure there are no distracting sounds; you
have a well-lit work area; and the office décor is in cool, restful colors. Soft music
will also affect your mood positively. Careless formatting, typing errors, spelling
errors, and printing smudges can all be distractions to understanding messages.
Paying attention to detail can easily correct these errors.
Not Listening
Not listening is perhaps the greatest barrier to effective communication. Few peo-
ple listen as attentively as they are capable of listening, and those who do have
trained themselves to listen. Real listening is an active process. You should listen
so intently and identify so closely that you experience the other person’s situation.
When you are an active listener:
• You show the other person you care and want to understand.
• You show the other person you accept and welcome him or her to talk to you.
• It fosters more meaningful, more helpful, closer relationships.
• It may reduce prejudice or negative assumptions about others because you get
to know them better.
• Others will enjoy talking to you and will open up more.
Recognize that good listening skills can be learned, and adopt a plan for im-
proving your listening skills. Here are other tips to improve your listening skills.
230

Building Communications Skills
• Concentrate on what is being said and on grasping the meaning of what is said.
Give your full attention to the person who is speaking. Avoid saying you under-
stand when you do not.
• Become aware of your listening barriers, such as allowing your mind to wander,
planning on what you are going to say next, or being close-minded about what
is being said.
• Let the speaker finish before you begin to speak. Remember you cannot listen
if you are thinking about the next thing you want to say.
• Repeat information to ensure complete understanding. Ask questions if you are
not sure you understand what the speaker has said.
• Take notes and confirm what you understand is what was meant. Listen for
key ideas.
• Don’t judge until you fully comprehend what the other person is saying.
• Give feedback. Sit up straight and have good eye contact with the speaker.
Nod your head now and then to show you understand. When appropriate,
smile, frown, laugh, or be silent. These clues help the speaker know you are
listening.
COMMUNICATING ACROSS CULTURES
The U.S. workforce has become a destination for many cultures to immigrate to
find peace, prosperity, education, or simply an opportunity to better themselves.
Our workforce is becoming more and more diverse (Figure 5). This influx of im-
migrants means that you may work in an office with coworkers from several cul-
tures. When communicating with various cultures, you will find you must make
some adjustments in your communication. Here are some suggestions to improve
your communications with those of other cultures.

3. Speak slowly and enunciate clearly.
Use pauses and full stops to give the
listener time to translate.
4. Watch for blank stares.
Blank stares or a glazed expression tells you the
listener may not comprehend your message.
5. Ask the listener to paraphrase.
When the listener can repeat your message,
there is a better chance it is being understood. Paraphrasing will give you an
opportunity to correct any misunderstanding.
6. Accept blame for misunderstanding.
Accepting blame will make the listener
feel less embarrassed about not understanding your message. Doing so will
also allow him or her to “save face” or show respect.
7. Listen without interrupting.
Don’t help the speaker finish his or her sentences.
Finishing sentences only points out what a poor command the speaker has of
the language; it also indicates the impatience on the part of the listener.
8. Follow up in writing when negotiating.
A follow-up message that summa-
rizes an agreement will confirm the results and avoid misunderstandings. A
person with limited English speaking skills may read with more understand-
ing than he or she speaks. In some countries, reading is taught and learned
well, but the opportunity to practice speaking English is often limited.
9. Observe nonverbal messages.
Examples of nonverbal messages are personal
space and eye contact, as mentioned earlier in this chapter.
Written Messages:
1. Use familiar formats.
Learn the format for keyboarding documents and
addressing envelopes for the country with which you are communicating.
2. Respect titles and ranks.
Send documents to the highest-ranking person in
an office and avoid sending copies to subordinates.
3. Use short sentences and short paragraphs.
Just as you learned earlier in this
chapter, keep your words simple and sentences and paragraphs short.
4. Use correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
Always spell-check, then
read over for words that might not have been caught by the spell checker. Cor-
rect any grammar or punctuation errors. Removing these barriers will help the
receiver to understand your message.

Building Communications Skills
Writing Effective Business Messages
Excellent writing skills are among the most important skills you can possess. The
business letter is one of the main vehicles for transmitting messages between the
organization and its customers or clients. You need to develop techniques that en-
able you to write well, just as you would use effective techniques in developing
communication skills.
THE WRITING PROCESS
Letters, reports, e-mail memorandums, and sometimes regular memos (mostly used
as a record) are the types of documents the office professional writes. The writing
process applies to each of these written communications. However, the office pro-
fessional will most often be required to write letters; therefore, our discussion here
will emphasize writing letters. Letters fall into three categories: (1) those written as
an assistant to the manager, (2) those written for the manager’s signature, and
(3) those written as a correspondent for the organization. Most office professionals
today write letters in one or more of these categories. Writing letters is a manager’s
responsibility he or she may do or delegate the task; consequently, an office profes-
sional composes only those letters the manager asks him or her to write.
Writing business letters is a significant endeavor. Think of the business letter as
your organization’s representative, going out alone to do a job. Keep in mind that
communication does not take place until the reader comprehends and responds to
the message. Realize the effectiveness of each letter you write depends on how well
you have written the letter to accomplish its task. Although you may learn many
guidelines for writing letters, recognize the significance of giving more thought to an-
ticipated reaction and results than to rigid procedures for writing letters (Figure 6).
The person who writes outstanding business letters works at it continually,
weighing each word, anticipating reader reaction, and carefully organizing the
contents to accomplish its purpose.
An effective business letter:
• focuses on a single purpose.
• is written from the reader’s viewpoint.
• conveys a meaningful message through complete-
ness, correctness, coherence, conciseness, clearness,
and courtesy.
• reflects a positive, sincere, and appropriate tone.
• is expressed in an interesting style through the use of
natural, vivid, and varied language.
Know Your Purpose
The purpose of a letter may be to inform, to create un-
derstanding and acceptance of an idea, to stimulate
thought, or to cause action.
Isolate the main purpose of the letter you are writ-
ing and develop your message around it. Make other
points secondary to the main purpose; give the second-
ary points a subordinate position. Use one letter to do
the job when you possibly can, but do not overwork
your letter. Sometimes you will need a series of letters
FIGURE 6 • Composing a letter at the computer.

234

Building Communications Skills
to accomplish one purpose. Unrelated topics that require answers should be pre-
sented in separate letters.
When you have composed a letter, consider these issues: “After the receiver
reads this letter, I want him or her to. . . .” or “The purpose of this letter is to. . . .”
or “Will this letter get the results I am seeking?”These considerations will help you
clearly define the letter’s purpose.
Focus on the Reader’s Viewpoint
Keep the reader in mind at all times. Make an effort to write all the sentences in a
letter from the reader’s point of view. Years ago when this writing technique was
developed, it was called the you-attitude. You-attitude techniques do not mean the
words you or your is used in every sentence. Using the you-attitude means to show
consideration for the reader—to explain what benefit the reader will enjoy, to put
the reader’s needs first, to emphasize the reader’s interests, and to use words that
are meaningful to the reader.
Try to put yourself in the reader’s place. Get to know the reader through the
letters in your letter files and try to visualize the reader in his or her type of busi-
ness. Be aware that self-interest is crucial in motivating readers to accept ideas or
to carry out suggested actions. Reflect the same interest in a reader’s needs in a let-
ter that you would if you were talking with him or her in your office or over the
telephone. Here is an example of writing from the reader’s point of view:

Convey a Meaningful Message
To determine that your message will be meaningful to the reader, check it for com-
pleteness, correctness, coherence, conciseness, clearness, and courtesy. These re-
quirements are sometimes called the six Cs of business writing
(Figure 7).
Completeness. When you are responding to a letter, you must an-
swer all the questions the reader asked or include a discussion con-
cerning all the topics mentioned in the reader’s letter. Often you can
use bullets to list the items or number the items to make each point
clear for the reader. When you are making a request, ask all the
questions to which you need answers. Always anticipate the back-
ground information you must supply so the reader can grasp the
full meaning of your message. Also, anticipate the questions the
reader will have when reading your letter; inject the response to
those anticipated questions. Be certain to include enclosures.
Correctness. Correctness denotes accuracy in every detail: accu-
rate facts and figures in the content, perfect spelling of every word,

flawless grammar and punctuation in every sentence, and an absence of key-
boarding errors. Appearance is important too: The letter should be centered on
the page so it is pleasing to the eye. Inaccurate information will confuse and even
irritate the reader and delay response. Therefore, try to eliminate the confusion
and additional communication generated by inaccurate, incomplete, or vague
information.
Coherence. Coherence refers to the arrangement of words and ideas in logical or-
der. Words and ideas must be arranged so they fit together naturally within each
sentence, within each main paragraph, and in the remaining paragraphs that hold
the communication together. A coherent communication is woven together so
carefully the reader is always sure of the relationship of words and ideas.
Conciseness. To write concise messages, use all the necessary words, but not more.
Send the reader a complete message, but avoid obscuring the thought with need-
less words. To distinguish between completeness and a profusion of words, watch
for irrelevant details, obvious information, and unnecessary repetition of words
and ideas. Eliminate them.
To be concise does not mean to be brief. When you concentrate solely on
brevity, you run the risk of writing a message that is incomplete or curt or both.
Instead, write the full message and stop.
Wordiness also results from the inclusion of expressions, often called trite ex-
pressions that convey no meaning. Here are some examples of wordiness:
Wordy
Concise
A check in the amount of
A check for
Made the announcement that
Announced
For the purpose of providing
To provide
At the present time
Now
Wordiness is an obstacle to concise writing because long phrases are used in
place of one or a few meaningful words.
Clearness. Clearness in writing cannot be isolated entirely from correctness, com-
pleteness, coherence, and conciseness, but clearness does involve an added dimen-
sion: choice of words. Words have different meanings to different people.
Nevertheless, as much as possible you must choose words that have the same
meaning for the reader as they do for you.
To write a message that can be understood is not enough. You must write a
message that cannot be misunderstood. Use familiar words; explain technical
words; and avoid colloquialisms, slang, and coined phrases. Words are symbols,
tools of thought. Your purpose is to choose a word that will penetrate the reader’s
mind and create the image you want the reader to associate with the word. To do
this, you need a vocabulary large enough to enable you to select a word that con-
veys the precise shade of meaning you want to express. You must understand both
the denotation and connotation of the words you use. Denotation is the explicit
dictionary meaning of the word. The suggested idea or overtone that a word ac-
quires through association, in addition to its explicit meaning, is called
connotation. Avoid any word with a connotation that would be distasteful to the
reader.

Courtesy. Your attitude toward the reader will have a noticeable effect on the tone
of the letter. Even though your attitude is not described in the letter, it has a way
of creeping in. Therefore, to set the appropriate tone, examine your feelings to-
ward the reader. Show consideration for the reader and reflect a sincere attitude
by using words such as please and thank you. Notice how different the following
sentences might appear to the receiver.
You must tear along the above perforation and keep this portion for your

Please tear along the above perforation and keep this portion for your records.
Reflect a Positive, Sincere, and Appropriate Tone
The tone of each letter must be appropriate for the given situation.Whenever it is ap-
propriate, write informally and radiate a warm, friendly tone. Be courteous and tact-
ful. Do not write sentences or include words that later you would regret having said.
One way to achieve tact in writing business letters is to replace negative words
and phrases with words and phrases that are positive in tone. Compare the tone
in the following phrases. The italicized words in the left column are negative in
tone. They have been omitted from the phrases in the right column.

How to Make Your Writing Interesting
When a reader receives a letter that is well written and interesting, it holds his or
her attention. Often the reader has received so many pieces of communication that
your letter is competing for attention. One way to get and keep that attention is to
make the writing interesting. Follow these guidelines to help you create an inter-
esting style of writing through using natural, vivid, and varied language:
• Use active verbs, except when you want the statement to be impersonal. The
subject of the sentence should do the action.
• Make the subject of the sentence a person, idea, or thing.
237

Building Communications Skills
• Use specific, meaningful words. Use general or abstract words only when a
concept has not yet been reduced to specific terms.
• Use familiar words and phrases in place of the unfamiliar.
• Use a phrase or a clause to describe rather than an adjective or an adverb.
• Use short words instead of long words.
Preparing Written Communications
To carry out your daily work, you may find yourself writing messages concerning
appointments, requests, orders, routine replies, acknowledgments, transmittals,
delays, follow-ups, and other business situations. For letters you sign, use the title
“Assistant to” followed by your manager’s name.
WRITING LETTERS FOR YOUR MANAGER’S SIGNATURE
In some instances you will be asked to write letters for your manager’s signature.
Writing letters for a manager’s signature requires a special skill. It is not an easy as-
signment because the letter must sound as though the person signing the letter actu-
ally wrote it.The reader should not be able to detect that an assistant wrote the letter.
The easiest letter to write for another person’s signature is the letter report pre-
senting a series of facts. The personality of the writer is not so apparent in factual
reports. If the message is lengthy, the assistant could write an informal report to
be accompanied by a cover letter actually written by the manager.
When you are asked to write letters for your manager’s signature, study your
manager’s letters to become thoroughly familiar with his or her vocabulary and
style. Use phrases your manager uses, use the same salutation and complimentary
close, and organize the letters in the same way your manager does. You may want
to use paragraphs, making appropriate changes, from letters your manager has
written previously if similar paragraphs are available. When it is feasible, prepare
a draft of the letter and ask your manager to review it and make changes before
you finalize the letter. Remain anonymous. Do not reveal you are writing letters
for your manager’s signature.
ROUTINE LETTERS
Following are some types of routine letters you may write either for your signa-
ture or for your manager’s signature.
Appointments
Appointments are requested, granted, confirmed, changed, canceled, and sometimes
refused as part of regular business procedure. An appointment can be handled en-
tirely by letter, by telephone, by e-mail, or by a combination of telephone and e-mail.
You will learn more about e-mail later in this chapter.This section covers the specifics
of what should be included when writing an e-mail message about appointments.
E-mails concerning appointments should follow the same guidelines used
when appointments are arranged by telephone: (1) refer to the purpose of the ap-
pointment; (2) clearly set forth the date, day, time, and place; and (3) request a con-
firmation of the appointment when it is applicable.
238

Building Communications Skills
When you are postponing or canceling an appointment for an indefinite pe-
riod, always express regret and suggest some provision for a future appointment.
When you are postponing the appointment, suggest another specific date and ask
for a confirmation.
Routine Requests, Inquiries, and Orders
When writing routine requests and inquiries, anticipate that the reply to your mes-
sage will be favorable. State the request or inquiry directly, include only essential
information, and create a pleasant tone. These messages will be short. If the mes-
sage seems curt because it is too brief, add a sentence or two to improve the tone.
For example:
Will you please send me a copy of your booklet, “21 Ideas: Tested Methods to
Improve Packing, Shipping, and Mail Room Operations”? We are continually
searching for methods to improve our mailing operations and are looking for-
ward to receiving this booklet.
Routine Replies
When a reply is favorable, state it in the opening sentence. The message of a favor-
able reply carries a favorable tone; therefore, even a brief message is effective. In a
disappointing reply, add a sentence or a paragraph to cushion or soften the message.
When declining a request, give at least one reason before you state the refusal.
Acknowledgments
Most acknowledgments either state or imply that another communication will fol-
low. Frequently, the office professional has the responsibility of writing acknowl-
edgments when the manager is away from the office for an extended period.
Acknowledge messages promptly, preferably the same day they are received.
Be cautious about giving away business secrets; make statements about your man-
ager’s absence in general terms. Avoid making promises or commitments your
manager cannot keep or would prefer not to keep. Make copies of the messages
you refer to others and of the messages you forward to your manager.
What you say in an acknowledgment depends on what you are doing about
the message. You can acknowledge the message without answering it, supply the
answer yourself, say you are referring the message to someone else for reply, or let
the reader know you are forwarding the message to your manager for reply.
Other uses of acknowledgments are to let the sender know that important doc-
uments have arrived and to confirm an order when the recipient is not expecting
immediate shipment.
Cover Letters
Cover letters are used in a search for employment. Brief cover letters are also writ-
ten to accompany transmission of other materials and identify the source. Here is
an example of a short cover letter:
Here is your copy of the report “Ten Years Ahead.” Mr. Whitehall asked me to
send each member of the Goals Committee a copy of the completed report.
Follow-up Letters
You may need to write a follow-up letter when you have not received something
promised or due or when you have not received a reply to a letter after a certain
period. Keep a careful record of missing enclosures and other items promised and
239

Building Communications Skills
write follow-up letters to obtain them. For information concerning assembling en-
closures see the heading “Assembling Enclosures” later in this chapter. Follow-up
letters can also serve as reminders.
Be specific about what is being requested. If you are referring to an unan-
swered letter, send a duplicate of it. Avoid making the reader feel at fault.
Appreciation Letters
Numerous situations arise in business for expressing appreciation. Do not neglect
writing thank-you letters. Be prompt in sending a thank-you letter, for the letter
loses its effectiveness if it is delayed.
To let the reader know that the letter was written especially for the reader, be
specific. For example:
Thank you for sending your proposal for needed changes in the contract with
dealers.
LETTER FORMATS
With the efficiency of e-mail messages, fewer formal letters are being prepared.
Further, unless the letter is formal, contemporary letters usually adopt a basic style.
The most popular and recognized formats are the full-block and modified-block
letter styles. However, there are many acceptable letter styles. When you are new
to the office position, begin by following the letter style already used in the office.
Once you have established your credibility, you may want to introduce one of the
following styles.
Full-Block Letter Style
Figure 8 illustrates a full-block letter style. Note that:
• Every line from the date to the reference initials begins at the left margin.
• Paragraphs are single spaced and not indented.
• A double space separates paragraphs.
• Four blank lines are left after the complimentary close to leave room for a signature.
Notice that Figure 8 also shows an example of mixed punctuation: A colon is
used after the salutation and a comma is used after the complimentary close.
Modified-Block Letter Style
Figure 9 illustrates a modified-block letter style. Note the format is the same as the
full-block style with the following exceptions:
• The date, complimentary close, and signature lines begin at the center of the
page and are keyed to the right of center (not centered).
• Although not shown in Figure 9, the paragraphs are sometimes indented. How-
ever, the preference is to block them at the left.
Notice that Figure 9 also shows open punctuation. This punctuation style uses
no punctuation after the salutation or after the complimentary close.
E-MAIL MEMORANDUMS
No Internet tool has such global use as e-mail. It is the most common form of com-
munication, surpassing the letter both within and outside an organization. E-mails
are used to transmit, confirm, request, inform, persuade, and report.

There are effective and ineffective ways to use e-mail to convey information in
today’s office.A major downside is that e-mail has become the most overused com-
munication tool available because it is so easy to use. One manager told us he reg-
ularly fields 150 e-mails each day. What a time-consuming, wasteful way to spend
an entire morning when half or more of the e-mails could have been eliminated!
As an example, he said he had sent some requested information to another

employee, and the employee sent him an e-mail thanking him for information he
was required to provide! The key to avoiding unnecessary e-mail is to think before
you create the e-mail. Ask yourself, “Is this e-mail really necessary?”
E-mail is frequently written quickly and often poorly. The writing principles
discussed previously for letters also apply to writing e-mail memorandums:
• Use the you-approach.
• Use positive language.
• Know your purpose.
• Be coherent, concise, correct, complete, clear, and courteous.
• Make your writing interesting.

FIGURE 10 • Format of an e-mail message.
You should also take a close look at your e-mail screen. You will see a lot of
technical jargon. Knowing what this jargon means can be valuable. In Figure 10 is
an e-mail message sent using Internet Explorer and Yahoo Mail, a popular e-mail
software.This figure identifies the parts of an e-mail message. Each e-mail software
screen is different, but the basic e-mail service is the same. Be sure you take time to
investigate your screen to fully understand all that your e-mail can do for you.
243

The following tips will help you to write e-mails that will be well received
every time:
• Include a salutation. It is preferable to always use the person’s name in the saluta-
tion. If you normally address the recipient by his or her first name, however, you
may omit the salutation or you may include something like Dear Ann or just Ann.
If you normally address the person as Miss/Mrs./Ms./Mr. Brown, that is the way
you should address him or her in the salutation—Dear Ms. Brown or just
Ms. Brown. When the e-mail has been sent to a group, always respond to a spe-
cific person rather than to everyone in the group, and address the person by name.
• Create a descriptive subject line. Your subject line must be meaningful. For ex-
ample, which one would you consider more descriptive: Change in Policy or
Change in Vacation Policy? Recipients scan the subject to determine whether or
not to open, forward, file, or trash the message.Your message is competing quite
often with many, many other e-mails.
• Write an attention-getting opening. Your first sentence or two will determine
whether the reader will continue reading on or delete the message. Get to the
point, be specific, and indicate a benefit to the reader, as in “How would you
like a raise this year? We need volunteers for the Salary Committee.”
• Use short sentences and simple words. Just as you learned in writing letters, you
must write on your audience’s level. Keep your e-mail messages simple and easy
to read and understand so the recipient will know exactly what you want him
or her to do. Try to keep your messages no longer than one screen.
• Focus on the you-attitude. Identify what is in it for the recipient for doing what you
want him or her to do. List the benefits, use numbering or bullets, and be specific.
• Keep each e-mail to one subject. If you want to express two concerns, do so in two
different e-mails. Often e-mails are filed by subject and two subjects in one e-mail
may mean one is lost, misfiled, or ignored. When possible, send short messages as
the subject line so recipients don’t have to open the e-mail to read a single line.
• Add a sense of urgency. Many times readers will respond faster when they know
you are working under a deadline.
• Avoid flaming. Flaming is expressing strong opinion or anger. Keying your e-mail
message in capital letters means you are yelling at the recipient. If you find your-
self writing in anger, take a break. Avoid hitting the “Send” button too quickly.
Take time to get your anger under control. Especially avoid flaming in all caps.
• Show respect and restraint when sending sensitive information. Show respect to
those receiving sensitive information by not sharing it with everyone. For in-
stance, if you need to reprimand certain individuals for taking too long at break
time, don’t send a general message to everyone. Target only those who are
breaking the rule and don’t alienate those who are in compliance.
• Proofread all messages. No message should contain misspelled words. Most 
e-mail programs have a spell-checker—use it! Read over the message carefully
to catch those words that are spelled correctly but used improperly. Also, use
correct punctuation, grammar, and capitalization. Messages with these errors
present a poor impression of the sender and the organization.
• Don’t send unsolicited attachments. Copy and paste all important points in the
message rather than sending an attachment. Often attachments take time to
download, or recipients fail to have the software such as Adobe Acrobat Reader
to open .pdf files. PDF (portable document format) is a universal file format
developed by Adobe® that preserves all the fonts, formatting, graphics, and color
of any source document, regardless of the application and platform used to
Building Communications Skills
244

Building Communications Skills
create it.To view pdf files, you need Adobe® Acrobat Reader, which you can down-
load free on the Internet. Should the recipient need the entire file for some reason,
then, of course, it should be attached. When you must send files, be aware of the
size of the file to avoid sending attachments that take a long time to download.
• Make sure your PC is protected against viruses. A virus is a program that at-
taches itself to a file, reproduces, and spreads from one file to another from one
computer to another. Viruses can be harmful, annoying, or damaging to your
files and computer. Unless you take precautions, such as regularly downloading
the latest files from your antivirus software, you run the risk of your computer
getting infected with a virus and unknowingly sending virus-infected e-mail
messages to everyone in your address book.
• Do not open suspicious e-mail. If the e-mail message looks suspicious, don’t open
it. Many viruses do damage when the message or an attached file is opened. If it
says in all caps that “YOU HAVE WON THE SPANISH LOTTERY!” ignore the
message. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
• Include the e-mail signature in your closing. Since it is not possible to sign your
e-mail, you should include the same information, minus the signature, at the
bottom of the e-mail message. Often companies will assign abbreviated names
or numbers for employee e-mail addresses, and those abbreviations and num-
bers mean nothing to someone else. E-mail software such as Microsoft® Out-
look or GroupWise will automatically add your signature information below
your e-mail message. In the signature line, you should include your name, title,
company name, e-mail address, fax number, and company phone number. Keep
the number of lines for your signature to five or less.
• Don’t break the e-mail threads. When an e-mail is sent the first time, the person
responding should reply to this e-mail; when the originator of the first e-mail
receives this first reply and needs to respond, he or she should do so in the same
e-mail. When this thread is followed and not broken, either the sender or re-
ceiver can follow the comments each has made throughout all the e-mails. If the
thread is broken, it is often difficult to follow what has been said previously.
• Format your messages simply. Avoid using colorful backgrounds, fancy fonts,
and animated images. When the messages are formatted using these extras,
sometimes the message will be sent as gibberish or even could crash the e-mail sys-
tem.Those fancy formats are for your personal use—not for the office. Formatting
e-mail messages should be plain text so any e-mail client can handle the format.

A last comment needs to be made about e-mail. People read their e-mail at dif-
ferent times. Don’t expect that you will receive an immediate response from every
e-mail. Assume that if you send a message, most people will read it and respond
within twenty-four hours; however, this is not a guarantee. If your message is ur-
gent, pick up the telephone.
STANDARD MEMORANDUMS
You may be called upon occasionally to write a memorandum, also called a memo,
rather than send the information as an e-mail message. You should continually
strive to improve your writing skills whether writing letters or memos. Keep a ref-
erence manual handy for resolving questions about grammar, punctuation, capital-
ization, and number use.When asked to write a memo, use the following guidelines:
• Use a standard format (most word processing software programs have memo
templates from which to choose).
• Write informally.
• Keep the memo to one page.
• Make sure the memo covers only one topic.
• Use lists whenever possible to itemize for easier reading.
Microsoft® Word offers templates for several memorandum forms. You can edit
the templates to suit your company's needs. See Figure 11 for an example of the Mi-
crosoft® Professional memo template from Word. To access Word 7 memo templates
on your computer, click on File, New, Memos, then select the desired memo template.
INFORMATIONAL REPORTS
An informational report tells the reader about a topic, idea, issue, or event, and the in-
formation is presented without analysis or recommendation.The purpose of an infor-
mational report is to select and emphasize the relevant facts clearly and concisely.
Examples of information reports are trip reports,progress reports,periodic reports,and
investigative reports. Because information reports do not contain sensitive or controver-
sial information, they are organized in a direct manner that presents the information in

WHAT IS MARKETING?
Marketing,more than any other business function,deals with customers.Building customer
relationships based on customer value and satisfaction is at the very heart of modern market-
ing. The definition of marketing is:Marketing is managing profitable customer relationships.The
twofold goal of marketing is to attract new customers by promising superior value and to keep
and grow current customers by delivering satisfaction.
Delivering What Is Promised
Wal-Mart has become the world’s largest retailer and the world’s largest company by deliv-
ering on its promise, “Always low princes. Always!” Ritz-Carlton promises—and delivers—truly
“memorable experiences” for its hotel guests. At Disney theme parks, “imaginers” work won-
ders in their quest to “make a dream come true today.” Dell Computers leads the personal
computer industry by consistently making good on its promise to “be direct.” Dell makes it easy
for customers to custom-design their own computers and have them delivered quickly to their
doorsteps or desktops. These and other highly successfully companies know that if they take
care of their customers, market share and profits will follow.

an objective, organized way. Usually the reader is somewhat familiar with the infor-
mation; therefore, background information is often omitted (see Figure 12).
How do you begin? First, ask yourself some key questions such as
• What kind of report am I writing?
• What is the purpose of the report?
• Who will read it?
• What are the key points of information the reader should know?
Once you have answered these questions, you can gather the information and
begin writing the report.

What Is Marketting? Page 2
Sound Marketing Strategy
A sound marketing strategy is critical to the success of every organization—large or small,
for-profit or not-for-profit, domestic or global. Large for-profit firms such as Proctor & Gamble,
Microsoft, Sony, Wal-Mart, IBM, and Marriott use marketing. And, so do not-for-profit organiza-
tions such as colleges, hospitals, museums, symphony orchestras, and even churches.
Moreover, marketing is practiced not only in the United States but also in the rest of the world.
You already know a lot about marketing—it’s all around you. You see the results of market-
ing in the abundance of products in your nearby shopping mall. You see marketing in the adver-
tisements that fill your TV screen, spice up your magazines, stuff your mailbox, or enliven your
Web pages. At home, at school, where you work, and where you play, you see marketing in
almost everything you do. Yet, there is much more to marketing than meets the consumer’s
casual eye. Behind it all is a massive network of people and activities competing for your
attention and purchases.

Trip reports are required following you or your supervisor's attendance at a
conference, convention, or other trip paid for by the company. These trip reports
are often summarized in an e-mail memorandum or standard memorandum iden-
tifying the event (date, time, location), outlining three to five key points (how the
trip benefited the company), and itemizing expenses incurred as required (may be
on a separate sheet or travel expense form). Close by expressing appreciation for
the opportunity to make the trip.
Progress reports, also called interim reports, describe for internal or external
readers ongoing projects to bring them up to date on the status of a project, plan,
or some activity. The basic format for trip reports is used where you include infor-
mation in an e-mail memorandum or standard memorandum identifying the proj-
ect, plan, or activity; summarizing three to five main points that brings the reader
up to date; itemizing expenses incurred as required; and expressing appreciation
or action to be taken or a statement of the value the reader will receive.
Periodic reports, sometimes called activity reports, help management keep up
with company operations. Examples are reports on sales figures, inventory levels,
profit figures, employee numbers, and many other bits of information that help
management make decisions. Periodic reports use the same format as the previous
reports—the e-mail memorandum or standard memorandum.They include summa-
rizing the activities that occurred during the reporting period, which may be weekly,
monthly, or annually; identifying problems; noting changes in progress; and mak-
ing requests as necessary. The main use of periodic reports is to keep management
informed about progress within the company, whether positive or negative.
Investigative reports are created about specific topics, situations, or event based
on research, without including interpretation or recommendation. The format
used for these reports are an e-mail memorandum or standard memorandum that
includes an introduction (presents the subject, purpose, and action to date), the
body (includes the facts, findings, or discussion) and a short summary (identifies
the main points of the report). These reports save the reader time. The information
needed is provided in a short report that can be quickly read instead of having to
complete the research. The research is delegated to the office professional.
In writing reports, the office professional must have excellent writing, grammar,
spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and number use skills. The workshops at the end
of each chapter in the text are designed for you to review the rules for each of these areas.

OTHER FORMS OF COMMUNICATION
Another common form of communication business has become a part of is
MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin. These are social networking Web sites
on the Internet where users ranging from the young to the old communicate to
249

Building Communications Skills
keep in touch with family and friends. Because of the tremendous growth of these
networks, companies have found it good business to explore these potential new
markets. Using a social network to promote a business gives its target audience a
chance to see products and services in a new way not previously available—online
instead in printed form. Here are some ways a business can promote itself through
these networks:
• Post ads. Of course, ads are the most obvious forms to sell or market products.
Posting an ad which might include photos, videos, and product descriptions can
target specific network users—and it is free!
• Play games. The network user can link to games to play allowing the business
to give information about their products.
• Set up slides. Slides identify products users can surf through to see if they are in-
terested making purchases.
• Join a group. Joining a group that has similar interests in what your company
sells allows a company employee to meet users and talk to them about company
products.
Office professionals, who most likely have personal experience using one or
more of these networks, may find themselves involved in writing, editing informa-
tion, or simply communicating with network users to promote the company and
its products or services.
Another way to communicate is through a blog. A blog (weblog) is an interac-
tive Web site where companies, small businesses, educational institutions, and gov-
ernmental agencies communicate by exchanging information with employees,
students, customers, or the public. Posts to blogs may be commentaries or news on
a particular topic and may include text, images, photos, videos or links to other
Web sites about the same topic. Blogs, for instance, may be written about personal
experience, organizational information, a certain topic, or a particular business.
Like social networks, blogs may promote business. Originally blogs had their ori-
gin from commercial online services such as CompuServe, e-mail lists, and bulletin
board systems. Office professionals may be involved in writing, editing, and post-
ing information in the company’s blog.
As an example, a company may set up their own intranet blog or join My-
Space or Twitter or one of the other networks to allow employees to share infor-
mation, promote products, respond to customers, or communicate about
projects or other company matters. When available, be sure to read your com-
pany’s guidelines for blogging. Here are some general guidelines of which you
should be aware.
• Identify yourself and your position within the company and write in the first
person.
• Avoid using a negative tone when referring to your company. Remember any-
one who has access to your blog can read what you write, and you are respon-
sible for the content.
• Avoid disclosing confidential information.
• Respect your audience. Don’t use ethnic slurs, personal insults, obscenity, or
engage in any conduct that would not be acceptable in the workplace.
• When you make a mistake be the first to post a correction and don’t alter pre-
vious posts without indicating that you have done so.
• Provide worthwhile information and perspective. You represent your company
and what you publish may reflect on your company.

Preparing Documents for Distribution
An effective business document is a package of information containing essential
facts, knowledge of business procedures and policies, and a specific message. All
of these ingredients are carefully woven together and sent to a specific destination.
Once the task of creating a final draft is completed, several steps must be taken
to ensure that the information package is accurate and complete. This section dis-
cusses the procedures necessary to complete the preparation process: proofread-
ing, submitting letters for signature, assembling enclosures, and addressing
envelopes.
PROOFREADING
All communication must be proofread and, if necessary, corrected. An office
worker’s mistakes easily could cost an organization goodwill, not to mention time
and money. It is essential that all documents are correct in grammar, punctuation,
content, format, and style. You can use proofreader’s symbols when editing hard
copy. Refer to the proofreading symbols in Figure 13, which shows the most com-
mon symbols and their use.A complete list of proofreader’s symbols is on the back
inside cover of this text. Remember people will judge the competence of your or-
ganization, your manager, and you by the quality of work they receive.
You can proofread using your word processing software’s spell-checker. Most
word processing software automatically checks grammar and style. Remember, how-
ever, word processing software cannot detect every possible error, such as then for
than, and should not replace your own proofreading and checking of a document.

Building Communications Skills
Proofreading at the Computer
✓Always consider your first version as a rough draft.
✓Don’t depend on your computer’s spell-checker to catch gram-
mar errors such as words that sound alike but have different
meanings, such as you’re for your, cite for site, their for there,
or misused words, such as loose for lose or then for than.
✓Be sure to turn on widow/orphan protection when using word
processing, so a single line will not be left stranded at the top
or bottom of a page.
✓Print a hard copy to double-check for spacing errors.
✓Do a thorough job of editing before you begin making your
corrections.
✓Check cross-references to other pages to make certain the in-
formation to which you are referring is still on those pages af-
ter editing.
✓After you finish making your editing corrections,proofread each
change carefully.
✓Do a spell-/grammar check again of the corrected version of
the document.
How to Double-Check Outgoing Documents
✓Check facts and figures. Verify specific information, such as
dates (verify dates with days of the week), time, amounts of
money (verify both figure and written amounts), columns of
data, proper names, and locations.
✓Check format. Make sure the date line, enumerations (verify
correct numbering, especially where corrections have been
made),centering (check spacing before and after centered lines),
salutation and closing lines, signature line, and enclosures have
the correct placement and spacing. (See Figures 8 and 9 for cor-
rect letter formats.)
✓Check for completeness and meaning. Make sure informa-
tion is complete (verify substitutions and omissions). Proofread
for meaning.
✓Check mechanics. Grammar, punctuation, spelling, capitaliza-
tion, and number use must be perfect.
SUBMITTING LETTERS FOR SIGNATURE
To save time and to decrease interruptions, group letters and submit them for signa-
ture. Submit as many letters as you can complete, allowing time for your manager
or others to sign them and for you to insert them in the envelopes before mail pickup.
The most appropriate time or the number of times each day to submit letters will
depend on the mail pickup schedule in your organization and what is convenient for
your manager. Written communication is most manageable when nothing is in the
FOR SIGNATURE folder (see Figure 14) but the material to be sent. Place the ad-
dressed envelope over each letter and its accompanying enclosures to separate each
item from the others in the stack. If a copy of a letter is to be mailed, place the match-
ing envelope over it and put it in the stack immediately after the original.
When the same letter is sent to two or more persons, all these letters must be
signed and should be arranged in the FOR SIGNATURE folder in the same order
in which the addresses appear on the letter.
Some managers want to see the letters being answered. If your manager wants
to see the letters, submit them in a second folder, arranged in the identical order of
the items to be signed.
Some office professionals have the responsibility of writing letters for their
manager’s signature, as mentioned earlier. Submit separately any letters you or
252

Building Communications Skills
someone else has written for your manager’s signature.
Your manager may want to read the letter before signing
it. Before you put a letter in an envelope:
1. Glance at the signature to ensure it has been signed.
2. Verify the enclosures and at the same time make a
check mark on the file copy by the enclosure notation
to indicate the enclosures were sent.
3. Make certain the addressee on the envelope and on the
letter are the same.
4. If your manager has written a note on a letter, photo-
copy it for the file.
Staple the file copy to the front of the letter being an-
swered, and put these items in the to-be-filed location.When
your manager initiates a letter of two or more pages long,
staple the pages of the file copy before placing it in the
to-be-filed location.
Sometimes all parts of a letter are not answered at one
time. You should keep track of this. Never file a letter that is only partially an-
swered. Mark the unanswered part and give it back to your manager. If your man-
ager asks you to sign a letter for him or her, sign it, and place your initials below
at the right end of your manager’s signature.
ASSEMBLING ENCLOSURES
An enclosure notation is typed on a letter to provide a checklist both at the time
the letter is being sent and at the time it is received. Therefore, choose the type of
notation that will be most helpful to you. Here are some tips to follow:
• You have the responsibility, whenever an enclosure is mentioned, of obtaining
or preparing it and attaching it to the document. When you submit documents
for signature, you should include all the enclosures with them. If you do submit
a document for signature without its enclosure, attach a note to inform your
manager and serve as a reminder to yourself to include it.
• Remember copies being mailed also require enclosures.You can make the copies
after the documents are signed. The recipient of the copy may need the enclo-
sures that accompany the original document, plus additional ones, to be
brought up to date on the transaction.
• If the item to be enclosed is on your desk, put the enclosure with the document.
Make a list of the enclosures needed on your to-do list and collect all the enclosures
at one time.Check off the enclosures as you obtain them.On this same list,jot down
reminders of all the tasks you must complete later pertaining to the processed doc-
uments. For instance, you may need to register a letter and request a return receipt
or to ask another department to package material for mailing separately.
• Keep a record of the persons receiving the copies and the date the documents were
distributed.You can write this information on the original near the top of the page.
• Letter-sized enclosures are placed behind the document and folded simultane-
ously; small enclosures are placed in the fold of the document. Enclosures that
have been prefolded mechanically should be placed in the fold of the document.
• To hold small enclosures temporarily in place until you are ready to insert the
document and the enclosures in the envelope, put them in the envelope or

fasten them to the document with a paper clip. Paper clips make imprints and
will sometimes catch and tear. To prevent this, fold a small sheet of paper over
the assembled items before you fasten them with the paper clip. Do not put a
paper clip in an envelope to be mailed.
• Do not staple enclosures to the document. Today, mail must go through four or
five high-speed machines at the post office. When you use a staple, you run the
risk of having the document torn up in a machine and of damaging several other
pieces of mail.
• When typing an e-mail message and sending an attachment, make certain the
receiver will be able to open and read the attachment. Remember that higher
versions of word processing software can read lower versions, but lower ver-
sions cannot always read higher versions, and not all word processing software
can convert files from other software. You can send files as text files (files saved
with a .txt extension) and any word processing software can read them.
• When you must mail large items, you are responsible for preparing the labels,
even if the items will be wrapped and sent by someone in another department.
When you forward an item to another department for handling, it probably will
be processed immediately. However, it is your responsibility to see the item is
mailed. If follow-up is necessary, place a note to do so in your tickler file (refer
to Chapter 4 for tickler file).
ADDRESSING ENVELOPES
The information in the inside address on an external letter and the address on the
envelope should be identical; the form could differ. The U.S. Postal Service recom-
mends all envelopes be addressed in all-capital letters and no punctuation appear
in the entire address, as shown in the following example:
MR HAROLD MARTIN
1515 REGAL ROW
DALLAS TX 75225
The inside address is usually typed with uppercase and lowercase letters. If win-
dow envelopes are used, the scanners used by the U.S. Postal Service can sort the
all-caps, no-punctuation style more rapidly. Also, if your equipment will store the
address to be automatically printed on the envelope and you want the address on
the envelope to be in all-caps style, you can accomplish this by using all caps for the
inside address. Address the envelope and place it face up over the top of the letter.
If your organization uses window envelopes for external letters,key the inside ad-
dress at a position on the letters that will ensure all the lines of the address are clearly
visible through the window. This can also be accomplished by keying the address on

a plain sheet of paper which is folded with the letter where the address shows in the
envelope window. Fold the letter so it cannot shift in the envelope, obscuring part of
the address. According to the U.S. Postal Service, there should be at least one-fourth
inch between the address and the left, right, and bottom edges of the window when
the insert moves to its full limits in the envelope. If the address contains more than
five lines, do not use a window envelope because the entire address will not show.
For interoffice communications at your location and for packet mail, use a
reusable interoffice or interdepartmental envelope (Figure 15). Be sure the name
of the last addressee is crossed out.Write the name of the addressee and an address
that is complete enough for the communication to be delivered without delay. Seal
an interoffice envelope if the enclosure is confidential. Some organizations do not
use interoffice envelopes except for confidential information. When envelopes are
not provided for nonconfidential interoffice mail, staple a routing slip with the ap-
propriate information on it near the top left edge of the communication. Do not
fold the communication.

Demonstrating Ethics in Writing
Many businesses today have a written code of ethics that encompasses everything
from ethics in business practices to ethics in receiving and writing e-mail. Use the
following guidelines:
• Make certain the information included in your writing is correct. Document
your writing with source information where necessary or make a note on your
file copy of the source you used. If you are asked later where you obtained your
information, you will have a ready reference.
• Keep all confidential information away from prying eyes. Place sensitive infor-
mation in a folder when you are not working on it rather than just in your in-
basket or on your desk where others might read it.
255

Building Communications Skills
• Make certain the information you write is your own. Always give credit where
credit is due when you use others’ work.
• Never violate copyright laws. A copyright identifies the legal right of authors or
artists to protect their work against unauthorized reproduction. Make certain
you have permission to use copyrighted material before you copy it.
• Maintain integrity in your communications. Much has been reported in the me-
dia about accountability at high levels in corporations. Everyone is accountable,
including you as an office professional. Never agree to cover for someone else’s
mistake that might compromise your position. Make certain that you know
where the information you work with comes from and keep supporting docu-
ments should you be asked to justify or verify information.
International Correspondence
You cannot assume that the rules you have learned about business writing in the
United States apply to other countries. Just as you must recognize the differences
in cultures, you must recognize and adjust to the differences in rules for writing in
those cultures. With the globalization of our economy, your learning must include
international information to build your skills in this area.
ADDRESSING ENVELOPES
When addressing envelopes to countries outside the United States, type the entire
address in all capital letters. The postal delivery zone should be included with the
city, when required. The country name must be typed in English, in all capital let-
ters, and as the only information on the last line. Do not abbreviate the name of
the country. For example:
MR THOMAS CLARK
117 RUSSELL DRIVE
LONDON W1P6HQ
ENGLAND
There is a new addressing standard for Canadian destinations. When the
postal address delivery zone is included in the address, use the standard abbrevia-
tion for provinces and territories. Leave two spaces between the province abbrevi-
ation and the postal code, as is shown in the following example between ON for
Ontario and K1A 0B1 for the postal code (replaces our zip code). Notice the en-
tire address is in all caps, as you use in the United States.
MS MARGARET LEWOSKI
2121 CLEAR STREET
OTTAWA ON K1A 0BI
CANADA
International postcards have specific maximum and minimum dimensions:
maximum 41⁄4  6, minimum 31⁄2  51⁄2.
If you are writing from outside the United States to someone in the United
States, type UNITED STATES OF AMERICA as the last line of the address.
256

Building Communications Skills
WRITING LETTERS
Because so many U.S. companies have offices or plants outside the United States
or do business with international companies, it is highly likely you will encounter
letters from outside the country. Letters from abroad may need translation. There-
fore, they will come to you in English. The wording may differ greatly from what
you have learned in this chapter or in a business communications class. For in-
stance, the usual format for a letter written in the United States that gives bad news
to the reader would begin by creating a neutral first paragraph that softens the
blow by reviewing the facts leading to the bad news, express the bad news, then
include a polite closing to maintain rapport with the reader. In Germany, however,
the buffer might be omitted, going right to the bad news. In Latin America, the let-
ter might avoid the bad news altogether. In Japan the letter may present the bad
news so politely that someone from the United States wouldn’t even recognize it.
All of this is to say misunderstandings are possible.
The more opportunities you have to read and analyze business letters from
abroad, the more you will become familiar with the differences in style and
wording. Here is a beginning sentence from the translation of a Spanish letter
into English:
“I am grateful for the opportunity to write to you to offer you my catalog. . . .”
If you received this business letter from someone in the United States, you
might consider the language flowerly and overly wordy.” Instead of saying, “I am
grateful for the opportunity to write to you to offer,” we would say, “Thank you
for requesting our catalog. . . .”Your acceptance of cultural diversity should extend
to business letters from abroad. Be patient, tolerant, and understanding, and
remember the sender’s culture is different from your own. This difference may be
reflected in both the writing and formatting of the correspondence.

OUTCOME
CONCEPT
1. Discuss the
communication process
and explain the
importance of
communication.
Employees spend the greater part of their time in some type of interpersonal situation.
The function of communication is to ensure all employees know what is expected of
them, the right person receives the correct information, and activities within the
organization are coordinated. Effective communication ensures management the
plans, procedures, and instructions are understood. When this process works
smoothly, group and team cooperation is assured and stress is reduced.
2. Discuss various
communication methods
and explain how to
overcome barriers to the
communication process.
The various communication methods are
•
verbal communications.
•
nonverbal communications.
•
written communications.
•
Writing business letters is a significant endeavor. Keep in mind communication
does not take place until the reader comprehends and responds to the message.
The effectiveness of each letter you write depends on how well you have written
the letter to accomplish its task. Give more thought to anticipated reaction and
results than to rigid procedures for writing letters.
•
Overcome barriers to communications such as missing the meaning, differing
interpretations using unfamiliar words, not listening, and emotional or physical
distractions.
3. Demonstrate how to
write and correctly
format a letter, memo,
and informational
report.
Follow the rules and writing styles:
•
Know your purpose.
•
Write from the reader’s point of view.
•
Follow the 6 Cs of writing.
•
Reflect a positive, sincere, and appropriate tone.
•
Express writing in an interesting style using natural, vivid, and varied language.
•
Choose full-block or modified-block letter style (see Figures 6-8 and 6-9) and
choose mixed or open punctuation in the salutation.
•
In informational reports select and emphasize relevant facts clearly and
concisely.
4. Discuss the various
types of written
communications for
which an office
professional should
develop excellent writing
skills.
Develop skills to write letters for the manager’s signature and letters requesting
information. Know various letter formats, and write and manage e-mail messages,
standard memorandums, and reports, such as trip, informational, progress, and
investigative reports. Be familiar with social networks such as MySpace, Facebook,
Twitter, and Linkedin since companies are using them for employees to
communicate and to promote business. Blogs have increased as a means of
communication thus requiring guidelines of which employees should be aware of.
5. Discuss how to prepare
routine communications
for distribution.
To prepare routine communications for distribution
•
Proofread carefully at the computer and any hard copies; double-check
outgoing documents for facts and figures, format, completeness, meaning,
grammar, punctuation, spelling, capitalization, and number use.
•
Verify that everything is signed, enclosures are included, addresses on the
envelopes and letter are the same, and any written note on the letter is

photocopied for the file when submitting letters for signature. Staple the file
copy to the front of the letter being answered and put it in the to-be-filed folder.
Keep track if a part of the letter is not answered.
•
Make sure the enclosure is included if an enclosure notation is typed on a letter,
keep the enclosure with the document being sent, and keep a record of the
persons receiving the enclosure and the date of distribution. Letter-sized
enclosures should be placed behind the document being sent and folded
simultaneously. Hold small enclosures temporarily in place with a paper clip
until they are mailed. Do not include a paper clip or staple enclosures in
envelopes to be mailed. When typing an e-mail message and sending an
attachment, make certain the receiver will be able to open and read the
attachment. When you mail large items, you are responsible for the labels.
•
Follow U.S. Postal Service recommended rules for addressing envelopes—all
caps and no punctuation. Make sure if you use window envelopes the address
is keyed so the address will show properly in the window. For interoffice
communications, use reusable interoffice envelopes with the last addressee’s
name crossed out.
6. Discuss the importance
of demonstrating ethics
through your writing.
•
Make certain the information included in your writing is correct. Document
your writing with source information where necessary or make a note on your
file copy of the source you used.
•
Keep all confidential information away from prying eyes. Place sensitive
information in a folder.
•
Make certain the information you write is your own. Always give credit where
credit is due.
7. Explain how to address
international envelopes
and write letters.
Type the entire address in all capital letters. The postal delivery zone should be
included with the city, when required. Key the country name as the only
information on the last line. Do not abbreviate the name of the country.
If you are writing from outside the country to someone in the United States,
type UNITED STATES OF AMERICA as the last line of the address.

1. Poor language skills. You have just been promoted to
office manager, which left an opening for the position
you vacated.A temporary has been working in your of-
fice, a dedicated hard-working office assistant with ex-
cellent technical skills. She is on the job every day, gets
along well with the office staff,and is excited about her
job. She has two problems: (1) Her language skills are
not polished,she frequently mispronounces words,and
often uses words incorrectly and (2) she dresses inap-
propriately for the office in your opinion. She has ap-
plied for the position,and you feel she is the person best
qualified for the job, especially with her experience in
the job already. If you hire her full-time, what would
you do to help her improve her language skills and her
dress? Be specific; write a complete step-by-step plan.
2. E-mail error. You sent a confirmation e-mail of an
informal meeting called by your manager. In the
e-mail message, you referred to the information
reports your manager asked participants to review
before the meeting. You sent the message without
attaching the reports. What do you do now?
3. Writing revisions. The office manager’s assistant re-
views all the writing you do, which is mostly letters
and reports. Your documents are constantly changed
to suit the assistant’s personal writing style; many
changes are simply another way of saying the same
thing. You think these changes are not errors on your
part but preferences on the assistant’s part. Because
you have to do so much editing,you are often not able
to complete all your work. Also, the assistant seems
to enjoy pointing out your errors, and this tactic is re-
ally beginning to annoy you. What should you do?
Identify three ways to handle the situation, assuming
each time that the previous attempt didn’t work.
4. E-mail abuse. You received a scathing e-mail from the
e-mail administrator reprimanding everyone using
the e-mail system for personal use. Some employees
have been abusing the system by sending and receiv-
ing personal e-mails. You have not been a part of this
group. You feel the administrator was wrong to send
the e-mail to everyone and should have addressed the
issue with each individual who was abusing the sys-
tem. How would you have handled this situation?

Task 1: Improving Telephone
Skills
Evaluate Incoming Calls; Prepare
Message Forms; Write a Memo
Ms. Quevedo has asked you to assist in training a new
office assistant in your office. While Ms. Quevedo is
away from the office this morning, Wednesday, October
16, you will have the office assistant evaluate the
following incoming calls. As you are aware, most of the
calls to your office are from Kirk Lawrence, the
administrative assistant to Henry Pippen, president of
Supreme Appliances, and the assistant VPs and their
administrative assistants from the different regions. At
times, the new office assistant will be screening
incoming calls from these same company employees.
Today you want to focus your training on preparing
message forms following the procedures already
established in your office.
Your Task
1. Have the office assistant to determine the calls that
require the transfer of information to message
forms and complete the forms. Retrieve a telephone
message form from the Web site.
a. Indicate what action has been taken on the tele-
phone call.
b. Record the necessary information for a message
to be given to Ms. Quevedo.
(9:15) Jeanette Sheffield (585) 409-0987 calls to
ask if Ms. Quevedo would like a ride to the
meeting tonight. Ms. Quevedo should let Ms.
Sheffield know before 4 p.m.
(9:26) George Sidwell (585) 431-6985 calls and
asks to speak to Ms. Quevedo. He refuses to
leave a message and says that it’s personal.
(9:37) Lupe Garcia (585) 425-9517 calls to cancel
her appointment with Ms. Quevedo that is sched-
uled for tomorrow because she has to go out of
town this afternoon. She will make another ap-
pointment upon her return later next week. She
would like to know what to do about the pro-
posal they were to discuss during their meeting.
(9:45) Ms. Quevedo calls to schedule a meeting
with the staff managers (Yolanda Johnson and
Beth Morgan).
2. Prepare a summary in memo format addressing the
following: How does the way you handle telephone
calls impact Supreme Appliances’ image, both inter-
nally and externally?
Task 2: Differing Interpretations
in Messages
Analyze Examples; Write a Memo
Recently Ms. Quevedo
attended a workshop on communications. She brought
back an activity the speaker had the audience complete.
She learned that interpreting a person’s meaning differently
than he or she meant it is a common barrier to
communication. Communication is unsuccessful unless the
receiver understands the message as the sender meant it.
She would like to have the staff complete this activity
during a brown-bag lunch she has planned.
Your Task
Ms. Quevedo asks you to complete the
activity before asking the staff. You are to analyze the
following examples of communication failures. In a
THE EXPANDED SIMULATION
266

memo to Ms. Quevedo, explain what went wrong in
each instance; in other words, “What we have here is a
failure to communicate.”
a. In a staff meeting concerning fire safety, the speaker
referred to a fire alarm as a combustion enunciator,
a door as a removable partition, a manhole as 
equipment access, and windows as decorative fixtures.
The audience did not understand his meaning.
b. Janie was stressed because of a deadline she had
coming up. She was continually thinking about what
she needed to do to finish on time. Ruth was explain-
ing to her the steps had changed to order supplies.
When Ruth finished explaining the new procedure,
she said,“Any questions?” Janie had no questions.
c. A manager said to his administrative assistant, “I’d
really appreciate your helping me with setting up
the party for Ms. Withrow’s retirement.” Later, the
assistant was resentful when she found out that she
had to set up the party herself.
d. Martin knew everything from A–Z about the new
project; however, when Helen asked him if he knew
where the McKinzey files, which were critical to her
completing her part of the project, were, Martin
said he did not know.
e. Christina, a harried employment interviewer, was
overwhelmed with applications for an opening that
had been advertised. She was asked to narrow the
group down to the best five applicants. She rejected
many of the job candidates she had to consider
because of the time constraint.
f. Ellen was Jill’s supervisor. Jill became nervous and
had difficulty explaining herself each time she had
to discuss an issue or problem with Ellen because
Ellen always seemed to appear impatient.
g. A manager felt union representatives were untrust-
worthy. He rejected positive gestures from a union
representative.

Handling E-mail
Because of its speed and accessibility, electronic mail (e-mail) is the most popular
and cost-effective mail system found in business. It is a computerized mail service
that enables users to transmit messages and documents over networks from one
computer to another. In many organizations, a private e-mail system known as an
intranet connects employees’ computers together. Employees are given a unique
e-mail address to which both internal and external users may send e-mail. Just as
office professionals are responsible for handling telephone traffic, they are also
likely to be first choice when it comes to sorting through the e-mail traffic awaiting
their managers’ reply. Both managers and office professionals often become over-
whelmed by the volume of messages they must sort through daily. Making this task
easier for your supervisor often becomes the responsibility of the office professional.
TIPS FOR HANDLING E-MAIL
Because e-mail is fast, cheap, efficient, and convenient, it has become one of the
primary forms of business communication. E-mail can be an effective, convenient
way to communicate with your manager, team members, and customers, but only
if you manage your mail efficiently.Without careful management, e-mail can bring
frustration and confusion to even the most organized employees.
Here are a few tips to help you get the real benefits of this service:
1. Check your messages frequently throughout the day. E-mail messages are like
pieces of paper on your desk. The messages must be treated with the same im-
portance as you give to traditional incoming mail. You might want to check
your messages first thing in the morning, at noon, and again late in the after-
noon. If you schedule regular times throughout the day to check e-mail, you’ll
be able to better manage your correspondence.
2. Respond to messages immediately. Get in the habit of answering messages
when you check your e-mail. Answering the messages promptly lets everyone
know you are on top of things and can be relied on for prompt response.
If you need more time to gather information before responding, let the
receiver know you received the message and are working on gathering the re-
quested information.
3. Sort and delete messages regularly. Doing so will save you from having to read
through old ones. If you want to keep some messages, you can save them to
electronic folders. Try to have no more than one screen of e-mails sitting in
your in-box at one time.
E-MAIL ETIQUETTE
It is a fact that e-mail is increasingly replacing standard letters, memos, and faxes
as a form of fast, easy, inexpensive, and effective communication. However, many
people have not yet learned the basic e-mail etiquette for sending concise and cour-
teous electronic messages.
Based on the importance of e-mail etiquette rules, or netiquette as it is some-
times called, the following information is provided as a review.
• Never send anything through e-mail that you don’t want made public. E-mail
messages travel to many readers—some of whom you may never meet.
Remember coworkers, managers, and others may have opportunities to read your
Processing Mail
272

Processing Mail
e-mail. There’s no way of knowing who will eventually read your messages, so
make sure whatever you enter in your message cannot return to haunt you later.
• Address the receiver by name in the opening sentence. E-mail etiquette dictates
that you simply include the receiver’s name in the first sentence. For example,
“Marilyn, thank you for your quick response.”
• Always reread messages before sending them. Use your spell-checker. Even if the
receiver knows you were rushed in sending the message, misspelled words show
carelessness and make an unfavorable impression. Double-check all facts and
figures. Sending incorrect information can cause delays in signing contracts, loss
of sales, and so on.
• Keep your message as concise as possible. Unless you are passing along infor-
mation that has been specifically requested by your receiver, try to keep your
message to a maximum of two screens. With the increase in use of electronic
mail, some office professionals receive forty messages or more daily. Just as clear
and concise writing is important in other business writing, it is equally impor-
tant in writing electronic messages. Most people do not have the time or incli-
nation to read lengthy postings.
• Use capital letters sparingly. In the e-mail world, a message or phrase written in
all caps is called “shouting.” Not only is shouting impolite, but messages writ-
ten in uppercase are difficult to read. Use capital letters only for emphasis. Some
users recommend that if you want to emphasize certain words or phrases, such
as confidential, highlight them.
• Most e-mail applications will automatically display the original messages in
replies and forwarded messages. When replying to another person and the orig-
inal message isn’t displayed, quote excerpts of the original message. This elimi-
nates the need for you to summarize what the other person has written.
Furthermore, you will remind the receiver of his or her original request and save
the person time from pulling up the original message for review. Your browser
can be set to repeat the sender’s message each time you reply.
• Always get a writer’s permission before forwarding or posting an e-mail message.
When someone sends you a message, the person may assume that the message
will be kept confidential. If you forward the message without the writer’s per-
mission, you may cause problems for that writer. If the writer knew the message
was to be forwarded, he or she may have written the message in a different style,
made a telephone call, or not written the message at all. In reality, many people
don’t obtain the writer’s permission before forwarding or posting it in another
location. Be careful of what you write. It may be passed on without your consent
or knowledge.
• When posting a message to a group, make sure your message is pertinent to all
members of the group. People dislike having to take the time to weed out messages
that are not appropriate or important to their specific work-related activities.
• When attaching a file to your e-mail, be certain you have actually attached the file.
Time is wasted for all who receive an e-mail that is supposed to include an attach-
ment and doesn’t. Double-check for attachments before you click the Send button.
ETHICAL ISSUES REGARDING E-MAIL
What every office employee should realize by now is how public their office e-mail
is. Many large organizations now use some type of software to monitor their em-
ployees’ incoming and outgoing e-mail.

__________________________________________________________________________________________
Employers have many legitimate reasons for monitoring their employees’ com-
puter use, including e-mail, such as
• maintaining the company’s professional reputation and image;
• improving employee productivity;
• increasing security;
• preventing employee disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information.
Few laws regulate employee monitoring, and courts have allowed employers a
great deal of leeway in watching employees’ e-mails and other Internet activity on
company-owned computers. Although employers do have valid reasons for mon-
itoring certain situations, many employers are attempting to reduce employee anx-
iety regarding privacy issues. More and more companies are establishing policies
governing business and personal e-mail and at the same time providing ways to
show their employees respect for their personal e-mail needs.
A major consideration is for employees to understand their company’s expec-
tation regarding monitoring e-mail and other computer activity, such as Web
browsing. Because the company is trying to establish a balance between security
and privacy, it is best to check with your company regarding its descriptions of ac-
ceptable and unacceptable behavior regarding e-mail.

Handling Traditional Incoming Mail
Traditional incoming mail is very different from what it was even a few years ago.
With the popularity of the Internet and electronic mail, as well as voice mail, the
office professional is seeing, reading, and controlling less traditional mail now than
ever before. Even so, every office still receives paper mail, and handling the mail re-
mains a high priority for an office professional.
When the mail is handled accurately and expeditiously, other office employees
can respond more efficiently to the needs addressed in the mail items. However, what
if a check from a customer is delivered to the wrong office and sits on a coworker’s
274

Processing Mail
desk for three extra days because the coworker is on vacation or has misplaced the
check? What is the impact on the office and the company? The accounting depart-
ment cannot issue credit to the customer’s account. The payroll department cannot
issue company funds to pay the commission earned by the salesperson and so on.
What about the company’s focus on the customer—internal and external? The
promptness with which you and your manager handle the mail is an important fac-
tor in building goodwill and increasing profits for your organization. It is in your
and the company’s best interest to choose the most efficient means of handling in-
coming and outgoing mail. Although far from comprehensive, this chapter intro-
duces alternatives and suggestions for working with mail services.
As an office professional, you may or may not have direct contact with the post
office, depending on whether your organization has a central mailing department.
Nonetheless, as an information worker, you should become knowledgeable about
handling incoming mail in your office.
You must keep up with every piece of mail that arrives, and you must be able
to distinguish between important and less important mail. As you will be handling
mail daily, establish a plan for handling it and follow your plan consistently.
As soon as the mail arrives, stop what you are doing, unless it is a rush job, and
handle the mail.
For an office professional to perform all the following steps would be too time con-
suming. Although it is not expected that every office will handle mail with this degree
of care, the office professional is certain to perform at least some of these steps:
1. sorting mail;
2. opening mail;
3. inspecting contents;
4. registering special mail;
5. date-time stamping mail;
6. reading and annotating mail;
7. presenting mail to the manager;
8. handling packages, publications, and advertising by mail;
9. distributing mail;
10. answering mail in the manager’s absence.
Although the volume of paper mail has decreased, some large organizations still have
central mail departments. Such departments are responsible for receiving all of the or-
ganization’s mail and for routing it to the correct departments or individuals. Usually,
the mail department provides at least one pickup and delivery to each department every
day. At one time, central mailing departments opened, date-time stamped, and distrib-
uted the mail. They rarely do so now; instead, recipients open their own mail, or the
office professional performs this task for the managers or department.
When the mail is delivered to one location, someone must sort the mail and de-
liver it to the appropriate workstations. If this task should be assigned to you, sort
and make the deliveries at once so the other office staff can process their own mail.
SORTING MAIL
When mail comes to your desk unopened, begin sorting it into the following groups:
• mail sent with urgency (express, special delivery, certified, and courier);
• letters, including bills and statements;
275

Processing Mail
• interoffice mail (printed copies of
budgets, and monthly or quarterly re-
ports);
• personal mail;
• newspapers and periodicals;
• booklets, catalogs, and other advertis-
ing materials;
• packages.
Keep the following tips in mind:
• The office professional may have to
sign for courier mail and other insured,
registered, or expedited pieces of mail
before they can be received. Keep the
priority mail separate from the rest of
the mail, open it as soon as it arrives,
and then put it on the addressee’s desk
in a way that calls attention to it.
Priority mail refers to courier mail that
is delivered via an expedited service
(Figure 1).
• In the stack of mail to be opened immediately, assemble letters and other im-
portant documents. Each item either requires a reply or provides your manager
with information he or she needs.
• You must decide whether mail addressed to an employee who is no longer with
the organization is personal or business related. If the mail is personal, clearly
write the forwarding address on the envelope and put it in the outgoing mail.
Letters, including bills and statements, can be forwarded without additional
postage. On the other hand, if mail is addressed by title to someone no longer
with the organization, you can assume it is a business letter. When you distrib-
ute the mail, deliver it unopened to the person who has the title or is responsible
for the work implied by the title. If this person is your manager, put the docu-
ment with the mail to be opened.
• As you sort, put aside all circulars, booklets, advertisements, newspapers, and
periodicals until you have opened and processed the more urgent mail.
OPENING MAIL
Before you begin opening the mail, assemble the supplies you will need: opener,
date stamp, stapler, paper clips, tickler file, to-do list (or daily chart plan), and pen-
cils (for notations).
Should you open an envelope by mistake, seal it with transparent tape, write,
“Opened by mistake” and your initials, and distribute or forward the envelope to
the addressee.
You can establish “Personal and Confidential” mail procedures with 
your manager when you first start working. Some high-level executive assistants
open personal and confidential mail for their managers. Either way, don’t
assume—ask.

INSPECTING THE CONTENTS
Here are some tips for removing and inspecting the contents:
• Keep the envelopes until you are certain all the enclosures and addresses are ac-
counted for.
• Inspect each document for the address and signature of the sender, the date, and
enclosures. When a document is not dated, write the postmark date on the doc-
ument and staple the envelope to the back of the letter. Also, if you notice a ma-
jor discrepancy between the date on the document and the date of arrival, staple
the envelope to the document.
• Check the enclosures received against the enclosure notations. If enclosures are
missing, make a note in the margin of the document. Follow up by requesting the
missing enclosure. Make a note on your to-do list at once.
• Staple an enclosure that is the same size as a letter or larger to the back of it. Use
paper clips to temporarily fasten an item that a staple would damage, such as a
check or legal document.
REGISTERING SPECIAL MAIL
A mail register provides a record of special (or priority) mail, including insured and
registered mail and packages. If you are not provided with a mail register, you can
easily design your own form. The form should include:
• date and time received;
• sender’s name;
• recipient’s name;
• description of type of mail;
• distribution (who within the company will receive the mail).
In some offices, the receptionist maintains the mail register. A mail register may be
kept in a loose-leaf notebook or in a computer file. Figure 2 shows an example of
a mail register you can create.
DATE-TIME STAMPING MAIL
The time of arrival of certain correspondence has legal significance. For example,
the date a payment is received can be a factor in allowing a cash discount, or a spe-
cific time of day can be set for opening bids. When correspondence is received too
late for the recipient to comply with a request, the date received is protection for
the addressee.
Organizations do not prejudge which correspondence should be date-time
stamped. With the exception of a few documents that should not be marred in any
way, organizations stamp all incoming mail either with the date or with both the
date and the hour of arrival. The date-time stamp should have the name of the per-
son’s office as well as a date and time indicator. Because it may be important to
know the exact date an item was received, do not skip this step.
Stamp the date received on each piece of correspondence in the white space at
the upper left, right, or top edge. The same pieces of correspondence may come to
your desk several times while they are being processed. If you date-time stamp all
the mail as you read it, you will know as soon as you see that stamp you have

READING AND ANNOTATING MAIL
If your manager receives an extra heavy load of correspondence, the following in-
formation can save time for you and your manager by marking and grouping cor-
respondence according to the next step to be taken for each piece. You do this by
reading the correspondence in search of the important facts, underlining key words
and dates, and writing marginal notes. In some cases, you will not know what the
next step should be; in other cases your manager will not agree with your notations.
Even so, by using good judgment you can organize the correspondence so your
manager can spend his or her time on the correspondence or documents that truly
need attention.
278

Processing Mail
Some managers prefer that nothing be underlined or written in the margins of
incoming letters. For this reason, get approval before you underline and annotate.
Read the correspondence rapidly, concentrating on the content and using a sys-
tematic method of making notes on which you can rely for following through. De-
velop a questioning attitude—one that will ensure you pick out significant facts and
decide what the next step should be. For instance, keep your eyes open for corre-
spondence that:
• contains the date of an appointment that must be entered in the calendar.
• mentions a report is being mailed separately.
• confirms a telephone conversation.
• requests a decision that cannot be made until additional information is obtained.
Use a pencil to underline and make marginal notes. Underline sparingly; otherwise,
your attempt to emphasize will lose its effectiveness. Underline any information
that reveals who, what, when, and where.
Provide your manager with additional information in the margins.This is called
annotating. Use small handwriting and make your notations brief.
Jot down what you would remind your manager of if you were talking to him
or her about it. For example, if the letter is a reminder to send a booklet that was
requested earlier and it has been mailed, write “Mailed” and the date of mailing.
If an item referred to in a letter arrived separately, write “Received.” See Figure 3 for
an example of an annotated letter.
Annotating is preferable to verbally reminding your manager. The use of mar-
ginal notes eliminates interruptions, and your manager is able to refer to those notes
as he or she answers the correspondence. Remember to ask your manager about
preferences in annotating. Marginal notes can confuse readers, and underlining can
irritate the readers to whom a letter or report is circulated.
As you read correspondence, pay close attention to the items that require
following up. Make the entries in the proper places in your reminder system. Your
follow-up plan needs to be foolproof; do not rely on your memory. Enter the date
of a meeting or the time of an appointment in both your manager’s appointment
calendar and your own.
Locate any additional related materials and attach them to the back of the re-
spective incoming correspondence. However, do not delay getting the mail to your
manager. You can obtain previous correspondence, locate information, and verify
figures while your manager is reading the mail.
Keep a record of any special items, such as checks and important forms, for-
warded to another person.
PRESENTING MAIL
When placing mail on your manager’s desk or in-box, follow these simple rules:
• Place the most urgent items on top and the least urgent items on the bottom.
When items are delivered by courier or faxed, they may be urgent; however, you
will need to determine this by reading the content. The longer you have worked
for a particular organization or manager, the better your judgment will be in sep-
arating urgent mail from routine mail.
• Mail should be placed in such a way it is not visible to people visiting your man-
ager’s office in his or her absence. Often, you can protect the confidentiality of
the mail by placing it in a large envelope or a folder.

HANDLING PACKAGES, PUBLICATIONS, AND ADVERTISING BY MAIL
Packages should receive priority over newspapers, periodicals, and advertising ma-
terials. Expedited parcels should receive the same priority as letters. In some cases,
you will be watching for the arrival of packages.
When handling these items, follow these procedures:
• Packages that have letters attached or that are marked “Letter Enclosed” should
be processed with the important mail. However, do not open a package or sepa-
rate a letter from it until you have time to check the contents carefully against
the packing slip or invoice. Always avoid opening a package with the intention
of checking the contents later.
280

Processing Mail
• Your manager will want to know if certain items
have arrived but will be interested in seeing new
items, not routine ones. For instance, if a shipment
of a recently revised form arrives, your manager
will want to know if what has been received is
what was specified. Place one of the forms on your
manager’s desk to see if the new shipment is indeed
what was ordered.
Follow these simple procedures when handling
publications:
• Unwrap newspapers and try to flatten them. On the
front cover of newspapers and periodicals, attach a
circulation list, which is a type of routing slip. The
routing slip is a small sheet of paper on which are
listed the names of the people to whom a item is to
be distributed. Each recipient should initial and date
the slip after he or she has seen the material, and
then forward it to the next person. See Figure 4.
• If the manager wishes to see the newspapers and
periodicals before they are circulated to the rest of
the staff, key his or her name at the top of each list.
Otherwise, names are commonly arranged in alpha-
betical order or according to the staff hierarchy.
• As people route the newspaper or periodical to the
next person on the list, they should draw a line
through their name on the circulation list.
When handling advertising materials, follow these procedures:
• Do not throw away advertising materials until your manager has had a chance
to glance at them. Managers want to know about new products in their fields;
perusing advertising materials is one way to become aware of what is new. If
your manager tells you to screen advertising materials, be sure you clearly un-
derstand which items to toss and which to keep.
• After your manager has seen the advertising materials, booklets, and catalogs,
you must decide what to do with them. For instance:
• Which ones should you keep?
• Which ones should you route to someone who has an interest in a particular
subject?
• Which ones should you discard?
Ask your manager to initial anything that might be looked at again.
• Donotclutteryourcorrespondencefileswithadvertisingmaterials.Throwawaymost
ads. For those you save, set up a separate file you can go through quickly and update
periodically.Advertising materials are usually not dated. However, if you date-stamp
them, you can separate the old from the new by looking at the Date Received stamp.
Replace old catalogs with new ones. If you keep many catalogs, work out a satisfac-
tory filing system for them. Pamphlet and magazine storage containers are available
from manufacturers of filing supplies and are an attractive and organized way to file
your catalogs, booklets, and magazines.

DISTRIBUTING MAIL
A manager has mail distributed to others to
• obtain information so that he or she can reply.
• ask someone else to reply directly.
• keep others informed.
Important mail can be delayed and can even get “lost” on someone’s desk.
Nevertheless, top management expects mail to be answered. Your manager is still
responsible for the reply to a letter or the response to a report even when the actual
writing of the correspondence has been delegated to someone else.
As a general rule, your manager will make notations on letters or send e-mails
asking others to provide information or to reply directly. Some managers attach
“Action Requested”or routing slips as they read the mail so they don’t have to han-
dle the same pieces of correspondence again. However, an office professional can
handle much of this responsibility. When given the responsibility for making re-
quests, realize a considerate tone will play a significant part in getting someone to
comply. In contrast, a demanding tone will detract from your efforts and sometimes
will result in the letter getting lost.
For informal requests for action, use an Action Requested slip similar to the one
shown in Figure 5. For example, attach an Action Requested slip to a piece of corre-
spondence that has been misdirected to your manager and obviously should be han-
dled in another department. Write the recipient’s name and check “Please handle.”
Sometimes a piece of correspondence requires two types of action, one of which
your manager can handle and another someone in another department must han-
dle. When this situation arises, let the other
person know precisely which part he or she is
to answer. In the margin of the correspon-
dence, indicate the part on which your man-
ager will follow through.
Decide whether the person who is to re-
ply will require earlier correspondence. If you
think he or she will need it, attach it to the
correspondence being distributed.
To obtain information, you will be
communicating with people in numerous
departments throughout the organization.
Make an effort to get acquainted with
them, at least by telephone or e-mail. When
you must obtain information from a service
department, for example, you should be
aware of the department’s work schedule.
Find out how much time must elapse be-
tween the time you request information
and the time the material will be ready. Of-
ten you will be pressed by a time line, and
you must communicate this. You may have
to request special service in order to meet
your time line. Be cautious of appearing al-
ways to request special service as other per-
sonnel may not continue to honor your
requests.

When you ask someone who is not following a predetermined schedule to as-
semble facts for you, request the information be ready by a designated time. Sug-
gest a realistic due date. Often, work that can be done when it is convenient to do
it gets relegated to the bottom of the stack. Here are some procedures to follow
when circulating materials:
• Attach a routing slip to mail that is to be distributed to more than one person.
• When mail is often circulated to the same people, the names can be preprinted.
On a preprinted slip, you can change the order in which material is to be circu-
lated by writing numbers in front of the names on the list. Be sure to include “Re-
turn to” near the bottom of a routing slip.
• When you distribute a letter or report to inform others, you will have to decide
whether to attach to the original a routing slip listing the names of the recipients,
make a copy and attach a routing slip, or make a copy for each person on the
list. When deciding, consider factors such as the number of pages, whether each
person on the list must be informed at the same time, your immediate need for
the original, and the risk that the original will be lost in circulation. Also con-
sider paper waste in deciding how many copies are necessary.
• Your records should show what information has been disseminated.When a circu-
lated item is returned, staple the routing slip to the document. This makes a per-
manent record of who saw the item and the date he or she saw it.When you do not
use a circulation list or routing slip and must make separate copies for each indi-
vidual, write on your file copy the names of the people to whom you sent the item.
ANSWERING MAIL IN THE MANAGER’S ABSENCE
What happens to the mail when your manager is away from the office depends on his
or her preferences and length of absence, and on the time and attention your manager
can give—or chooses to give—to what is going on during his or her absence.
While your manager is away from the office, he or she will usually call, e-mail,
or use other messaging methods. With electronic capabilities of telephones, hotels,
and airlines, managers can quickly access their e-mail or text messages and keep up
with their own messages.
If your manager is away from the office for only a day or two, his or her pref-
erence probably will be for you to put aside all his or her mail. However, never put
aside correspondence that must be handled immediately. If there is no one in the of-
fice who is authorized to reply to an urgent message, you may choose to contact
your manager.
Send letters or e-mails that require immediate action to the person designated
to answer them; make copies of the letters and write the name of the person re-
ceiving each one on the letter itself. Put the copies in a folder for your manager
marked “Correspondence to Be Read.”
Answer any correspondence you can answer. Acknowledge the e-mails not be-
ing answered immediately, indicating your manager will return to the office on a
specific date and the sender can expect a reply soon after he or she returns. Note
and reply to the e-mail address on the incoming e-mail. This form of response is ex-
pedient and can provide a concise record of your actions. Most browsers can be set
to send an automatic reply to all e-mail messages received when the person is away
from the office for several days.
Organize all the business mail in folders that accumulates during your man-
ager’s absence. Place the folders, along with your summary of the mail, on your
manager’s desk in the order listed below. Keep personal mail in a separate folder
Processing Mail
283

Processing Mail
(perhaps use a different color) and put it on your manager’s desk in a separate place.
The folders might be labeled as follows:
• “Correspondence for Signature”—for letters you prepared for his or her signa-
ture and any other documents ready for signatures. You may consider a red
folder for signatures.
• “Correspondence Requiring Attention”—for all correspondence, including any
e-mails left unanswered, your manager must answer. A yellow folder will work
for this type of correspondence.
• “Correspondence to Be Read”—for copies of letters you and others have an-
swered, and copies of your replies. Again, you would need to clarify your man-
ager’s preference for handling the e-mails. For this folder, consider a blue folder.
• “Reports and Other Informational Correspondence”—for all informational
items. A green folder is suggested for this type of correspondence.
• “Advertisements”—for advertising brochures and other literature for your man-
ager’s perusal. You may consider an orange folder for advertisements.

Handling Outgoing Domestic Mail
Outgoing mail is handled by mailroom personnel in large organizations or by of-
fice professionals in smaller organizations. Regardless of who processes the out-
going mail, you should be familiar with basic procedures, such as special mail
services and international mail. The more familiar you are with these procedures,
the more efficiently you can process the outgoing mail without delays or addi-
tional costs incurred in mailing items.
The following steps will help you in preparing items to be mailed:
1. Review all documents for signatures and enclosures.
2. Verify the inside address with the envelope address.
3. Determine the most accurate way of mailing an item if needed.
4. Presort mail for speedier handling by the post office. Separate mail into cate-
gories, such as local, out-of-town, and metered.
Outgoing mail is divided into two classes: domestic and international.
284

Processing Mail
Domestic mail is transmitted within, among, and between the United States
and its territories and possessions;
• Army–Air Force post offices (APO) and Navy post offices (FPO); and
• United Nations, New York City.
To learn more about domestic mail, contact your local post office and request
the U.S. Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) or access the United States Postal Service
(USPS) Web site at http://usps.com. You will learn about international mail in the
next main section.
Mail sent within the United States and its possessions should always be ad-
dressed using approved two-letter postal abbreviations for state and possession
names and the five-digit ZIP code (for zone improvement plan, a number that
identifies postal delivery areas) or ZIP  4 code for the area. You can locate a ZIP
code at the USPS Web site, shown above.
FORMATS FOR EFFICIENT PROCESSING
ZIP  4.
While a standard five-digit ZIP code is sufficient for most mail in the United States,
an extra four digits is sometimes needed. The expanded ZIP code, called the ZIP
 4 code, is composed of the original five-digit code, followed by a hyphen, and
four additional digits. For example, the ZIP  4 code for Richardson, Texas, is
75080-6949.
The ZIP  4 identifies a geographic segment within the five-digit delivery area
such as a city block, an office building, an individual high-volume receiver of mail,
or any other unit that would aid efficient mail sorting and delivery. Using ZIP  4
reduces the number of handlings and significantly decreases the potential for hu-
man error and the possibility of nondelivery.
You can locate ZIP code  4 by using ZIP Code Lookup.
1. Access the Internet.
2. Enter search words ZIP code lookup.
3. Enter a street address, city, state, and ZIP code.
The result will show the requested five-digit ZIP code  four digits.
Abbreviations
When addressing mail, use the two-letter abbreviations for states and U.S. posses-
sions and use official postal service abbreviations for street suffixes, directionals,
and locations. Refer to the following list, which shows the abbreviations for states
and commonly used street suffixes, directionals, and locations.

Recalling Mail
If you make an error in mailing that is serious enough to warrant recalling a piece
of mail, you may be able to do so if you act quickly. Hopefully you won’t have to
recall mail to be either withdrawn or to be put on hold; however, if you do, follow
the following steps:
1. Call the post office branch in your mailing zone if the document is for local de-
livery; call the central post office if the document is for out-of-town delivery.
2. Request that the document(s) be held.
3. For identification, type an address identical to the address on the envelope
being recalled.
4. Go to the post office, complete a Sender’s Application for Withdrawal of Mail,
and present it and the duplicate address to the postal clerk or representative.
Returning Undelivered Mail
Keep mailing lists up to date and address envelopes and labels with absolute ac-
curacy to avoid the cost and delay involved when mail is returned. A returned let-
ter must be placed in a fresh envelope correctly addressed with new postage.
If the addressee has moved or simply refuses to accept mail, if there is insuffi-
cient postage or an incorrect or incomplete address, or if for other reasons the mail
cannot be delivered, the post office will return the item to the sender.
BASIC BULK MAIL
The term bulk mail is generally used to describe presorting mail, including pre-
sorted First-Class Mail® and Standard Mail. Business Mail 101 at the USPS Web
site provides basic information for preparing bulk mail, including questions that
will assist you in determining the type of bulk mail that is right for you. To answer
questions such as “Is bulk mail right for your business?” and “How do you sort
bulk mail?” visit the USPS Web site and locate information regarding bulk mail.
DANGEROUS GOODS
Articles or substances that could be dangerous to postal workers and postal equipment,
or that could damage other mail, are prohibited from being mailed both domestically
and to points outside the United States.It is illegal to use the domestic service to deliver:
• explosives;
• flammable solids and flammable liquids;
• radioactive materials;
• gases, oxidizers, and organic peroxides;
• corrosives;
• toxic and infectious substances;
• miscellaneous dangerous goods, such as asbestos, air bags, and dry ice.

A list of restricted items is available for international mail as well. If you are in
doubt about any item you wish to mail, call your local post office.
OTHER DELIVERY SERVICES
Other delivery services are available through companies, such as DHL (http:
//www.dhl-usa.com), United Parcel Service (UPS; http://www.ups.com), Federal
Express Corporation (FedEx; http://fedex.com), and Purolator Courier Corpora-
tion (http://www.purolator.com). These companies provide pickup services as well
as drop-off locations. They offer online services that allow you to electronically
complete the necessary forms and to track a shipment through to its destination.
Messenger or courier services can save you money and ensure immediate de-
livery within the city. They are useful if you have a constant flow of local deliver-
ies and pickups. You can arrange to have pickups and deliveries made at a set time
of the day, or you can ask the service to be on call for your varying needs. Check
your telephone directory for local messenger services.
In addition, private companies such as Eagle Mail and Pak Mail provide packing
and shipping to anywhere in the world.Additional services include mail boxes, mail-
ing label preparation, and meter mail. They will also insure your mail, accept COD,
sell money orders, and send and receive faxes. Many of these companies are drop-off
locations for UPS and FedEx. For example, Kinko’s is a drop-off location for FedEx.
To select the best provider, compare the services, rates, and regulations of these
companies as well as those of the U.S. Postal Service.
TRACKING MAIL
Now you can track your mail as it moves through the postal system.The USPS and
other delivery services mentioned above provide tracking systems so you can check
on the delivery status of your mailing. To track your mail, enter your label or
receipt number in the space provided on their Web site. For example, the USPS
offers Track and Confirm® to make it easy to verify the delivery of your mail.
International Mail
International mail is mail that is distributed beyond the United States and its ter-
ritories or possessions. The International Mail Manual (IMM) sets forth the poli-

INTERNATIONAL POSTAGE
It is essential to have some foolproof way of ensuring that correct postage is put
on international airmail. Nothing is more frustrating to your manager than to learn
an urgent package was mailed by the slowest method because the postage was in-
sufficient or because you did not select the most appropriate service to use in the
situation. As the office professional supporting your manager, you should see that
the mailroom has current postage information for all countries with which you
communicate. Make sure the information is clearly posted, so that even the casual
user, like your manager, can calculate the correct postage if he or she should need
to work over the weekend when no office support staff is available.

Using Office Equipment
Over the past decade technology has made many office tasks easier, including
adding postage to correspondence. In this section, office equipment is discussed as
it relates to the mail function.
POSTAGE METERS
Every office uses the U.S. Postal Service to mail their bills, payments, and routine cor-
respondence. Although some use stamps, most use a postage meter. A postage meter
293

Processing Mail
is a machine that applies postage to an envelope or package, eliminating the need for
licking or sticking stamps.
A postage meter consists of two basic parts: the meter, which belongs to the
post office, and the mailing machine, which the organization owns. The machine
itself is purchased, but the meter is leased from the manufacturer (one of several
authorized by the USPS) and is licensed without charge by the post office. If you
have questions about postage meters, contact a postage meter company, such as
Pitney Bowes, Mail Technology, Inc., or the USPS.
Because properly prepared metered mail can go directly to the sorting machine
in the postal center, it may be dispatched slightly sooner than other mail. However,
the real advantage to the user is the convenience of not using stamps, not waiting in
line at the post office,and being able to apply whatever amount of postage is needed.
Postage meters vary in size from lightweight desk models to fully automatic
models that feed, seal, and stack envelopes in addition to printing the postage, the
postmark, and the date of mailing (see Figure 6).
The user of a basic postage meter must take the meter to the post office and
pay for a specified amount of postage. The postal agent then sets the meter dials
for this amount. Each time an envelope is imprinted with an amount of postage,
the unused balance on the meter is decreased by that amount. When the unused
balance runs low, the meter must be taken to the post office to be reset.
Using a Postage Meter: Here are some basic procedures to follow when using a
postage meter:
1. Check the manual dials or electronic readout to make sure the correct postage
will be printed on the mail.
2. Check the meter date to be certain it is the correct date of mailing, not the pre-
vious day’s date.
3. To work efficiently, group your mail and stamp all mail requiring the same de-
nomination in one batch.
4. Set aside pieces of mail requiring irregular amounts of postage until the rest
of the mail is stamped.
5. After you have processed all the mail, reset the machine so the next user will
not waste postage because the meter was set for the wrong amount.
6. Bundle metered mail with addresses facing one direction, and group the pieces
by the class of mail.

Processing Mail
Avoid making mistakes when stamping mail, but if you do make an error, you
can request credit from the leasing agent.When complete and legible meter stamps
cannot be used because of misprints, spoiled envelopes or cards, and the like, the
agent will credit the postage. You should note that in order to receive a credit, you
must supply the complete envelope as proof, not just the meter impression.
POSTAL SCALES
If your office does not use a postage meter, consider a postal scale. Postal scales
are a good investment because they show both the weight and the amount of
postage required. As postal rates increase, it is essential for office professionals to
determine the correct postage according to the weight to reduce mailing costs.
If you need a postal scale but one is not available, you can use any scale that
weighs in ounces. You can then translate the weight into the correct postage by us-
ing a current postal rate chart, available from the USPS.
POSTAGE PRICE CALCULATION
If you know the weight of your correspondence, you can calculate the postage
price for domestic and international mail from your computer by using the postage
calculation link on U.S. Postal Service’s Web site. In addition to calculating the
postage price, you can also print the postage.

FACSIMILE (FAX) MACHINES
The facsimile, commonly known as the fax machine, is a device that will copy and
transmit graphics (charts, photographs, drawings, and handwritten messages) and
text messages as electronic signals via the telephone lines or from a personal com-
puter equipped with a modem. The document will be reproduced on paper at the
destination fax machine or as a file stored in a computer.
Although sending an e-mail may be quick, sometimes you may not have cer-
tain files, such as charts and photographs, in an electronic format to send as at-
tachments. Sending a message via a fax machine may be the quickest way to get
documents in several different formats across the city, country, or even the world.
Using the fax machine to send a document is less expensive than using most courier
services. The speed of fax transmission varies with the size of the page, the density
of the image to be faxed, and the levels of technology of the fax machine sending
and receiving documents. However, the sender can be sure that regardless of the
distance, the document will reach its destination within seconds of being sent.
Fax transmission uses telephone lines to send documents; in fact, sending a fax
is as easy as making a telephone call. Fax machines operate automatically, allow-
ing you to send documents without first notifying the recipient.
295

Processing Mail
Using a Fax Machine. The general procedures are very simple:
1. Complete an adhesive note or use a transmittal form to show contact infor-
mation of sender and recipient.
2. Place the document to be transmitted in the sending fax unit. Check the in-
structions to know whether the document must be placed face up or down.
3. Dial the fax number of the receiver. Check to see if you need to dial a long-
distance access code for transmission outside the local area code.
4. Once the connection is made, press the send button.
Most offices purchase both a stand-alone fax
machine, which is self-contained as shown in
Figure 7, and computer software because it
gives them the versatility to send and receive
documents using either the stand-alone ma-
chine or the computer. Some small offices are
purchasing a combined unit, which functions
as a fax machine as well as a scanner, copier,
and printer (Figure 8).
To send a fax from your computer, you
need special fax software that comes with a
variety of features. Some software programs
allow you to send a “broadcast” fax to many
other computers; other fax programs allow
you to receive incoming faxes in the screen
background so you can continue working on
the computer while the fax is being sent. Re-
member, a fax sent via a modem is only a pic-
ture of the document, not the document itself,
so it cannot be edited.
In an office where fax machines are con-
nected to a network, polling may be required.

Polling allows one fax machine to test others on the network for information. Users
can store their messages on the fax network. The person waiting to receive the mes-
sages instructs his or her fax station to poll the other machines for faxes with the cor-
rect poll code.When the correct code is found,the message is transferred to the polling
fax machine. A head office wishing to pick up orders or check inventory from its
stores, for example, may require the polling feature.
Establishing clear, simple guidelines for using the fax can reduce unnecessary
transmissions and save both time and money. Follow these tips to help establish
your guidelines.
1. Determine if the message should be faxed or distributed using another
method.
2. If a document is delivered by fax, type an appropriate notation on the line be-
low the reference initials or on the line below the enclosure notation, if used.
A notation such as “By fax” is appropriate.
3. Decide which type of cover sheet will be used. WordPerfect and Microsoft®

4. Determine guidelines regarding confidentiality. Confidentiality is perhaps
the highest concern facing businesses using fax machines. Consider arrang-
ing for only authorized staff members to transmit and receive confidential
fax transmissions.
5. Determine how you will report misdirected messages. Nothing is more frus-
trating than to have sent a message and then find out it was misdirected and
no one made an effort to let the sender know about the error.
SCANNERS
A scanner is a device used to input text, such as a report; photographs; and bulky
items, such as the cover of a DVD. Scanners are useful in offices where the goal is
to move into a paperless document system. The most common types are flatbed
scanners, sheetfed scanners, photo scanners, and portable scanners.
• Flatbed scanners look like miniature printers with a flip-up cover protecting the
glass platen. Depending on its size, a flatbed scanner can fit standard or legal-
size documents, and the flexible cover allows you to scan large items such as
books. Flatbed scanners are often built into multifunction printers.
• Sheetfed scanners are smaller than flatbed scanners and allow you to feed a doc-
ument or photo into the scanner rather than place it on top. An advantage to
using a sheetfed scanner is you can feed documents in bunches. With a flatbed
scanner, you will have to scan one page at a time (unless it comes with an auto-
matic document feeder).
• Photo scanners are especially designed to scan film and slides; they also have
built-in software to clean up old photos. Many all-purpose scanners can also
scan photos, so you may not need a specialized photo scanner.
• Portable scanners are small, handheld devices, which generally produce lower-
quality results than the other types.
Scanners can be purchased as stand-alone or as multifunction devices. For exam-
ple, your office may use one machine that performs multifunctions, such as copy-
ing, printing, and scanning.
Using a scanner
Because there are different types of scanners, the following steps are general in
their description:
1. Place the side of the document you want scanned face-down on the glass plate.
2. Line the document up on the glass plate using the guides on the side of the glass.
3. Press the scan button to start the process, which should open a window in the
scanning software on your computer presenting you with several options and
settings.
4. Choose your settings and options.
5. Save your scanned image; select the drive or folder where you would like to
store the scanned document.
PHOTOCOPIERS
With the convergence of printers, scanners, photocopiers, and fax machines into a
single device, you can now find multifunction printers, all-in-one, or multifunction
devices. Today’s printer/copier provides networked printing, scanning, copying,
digital sending, and even faxing, with the full finishing capabilities of a traditional

photocopier. Although it makes sense from a technology standpoint, it can be con-
fusing to choose from the wide selection of products and decide which product is
best for your company.
To gain a better understanding of which types of multifunction products are
appropriate, it will help to distinguish between a copier-based device and a printer-
based device. A copier-based device, running fifty-five to more than eighty-five
pages per minute, has finishing capabilities, such as stacking, stapling, and hole
punching. Because this equipment is built for high volume and production-level
usage, the average cost per page can be lower than the printer-based devices.
Copier-based devices are often leased on a usage basis, rather than purchased for
a flat fee. A printer-based device can cost much less than a copier-based device and
does not offer the finishing capabilities.
The following categories provide a general framework in which to demon-
strate how both copier-based and printer-based devices may be used in various
workgroups:
Personal
• Low-volume; used in individual areas; placed on desktops to print word pro-
cessing documents, spreadsheets, and other daily work; are usually printer-based
devices; may be networked for very small work groups of two to four users
• Easy to use
• Print approximately fifteen to twenty-five pages per minute
Small- to Mid-Size Workgroup
• Mid-volume; provide high-speed networked printing, copying, digital sending,
and faxing for small workgroups of five to twenty users
• Need skills to scan and to perform digital sending task
• Accommodate more paper sizes and paper weights; operate through touch con-
trol screens; perform features such as front and back printing; stacking, sta-
pling, hole punching, binding documents into book style, and enlarging and
decreasing size of text or images
• Print approximately twenty-five to fifty pages per minute
Department
• High-volume
• Multifunction device; floor-console models; provide networked printing, pho-
tocopying, scanning, and digital sending for groups of twenty or more users
• Need skills to scan and to perform digital sending task
• Perform same features as mid-volume
• Print up to sixty-five pages per minute
299

Processing Mail
Production
• High-volume
• Floor-console models; may or may not be attached to the office network; pro-
duce documents in book format; hold large supplies of paper; insert tabs and
coversheets where programmed to do so; produce high-quality color
• Usually require additional training because of extended features
Some high-volume copiers can create images according to programmed instruc-
tions and are called digital intelligent copiers. They contain microprocessors that
enable the copier to produce copies from instructions transmitted by computers as
well as by remote equipment by means of telephone wires.
Which Photocopier Do I Use?
As an office professional, you may be asked to serve on your company’s technology
team to determine the most appropriate device to meet your workgroup’s needs.
Knowledge of printers/copiers helps you to make an efficient decision.The decision
depends on a number of considerations. Here are a few questions to consider:
1. How many copies are needed?
2. How quickly are the copies needed?
3. How important is the appearance of the final copy?
4. Is the original document usable as is?
5. Are the copies to be stacked, stapled, or hole punched?
6. Is an enlargement or reduction of text or photo required?
Considerations Regarding Photocopying
It is important to consider areas of photocopying that can raise costs. Consider the
following scenario:
Juan,assistant to the regional sales manager,was asked to study the department’s
rising copying costs.After investigating the procedures and copying habits of the de-
partment staff for three weeks,Juan reported the following problems to his manager:
1. Additional copies were made—more than needed.
2. Individuals were copying documents that the in-house copy center should
have handled.
3. Individuals were making copies for personal use.
Organizations have different options available to them. One popular method
of controlling the use of a copier is to provide the appropriate people with indi-
vidual copy cards or keys. When the card or key is used, the copier registers the
number of copies made. This method discourages people from making too many
copies and making personal copies. Often the copy cards can be purchased in ad-
vance, thus allowing the department to prepay for copying privileges.
Another important consideration is that of copying materials that infringe on
the U.S. copyright law. Materials that are protected contain a notice of copyright.
In many organizations in areas where copying is done, a notice of the copyright
law is posted at the copier to ensure employees are aware of their responsibilities.
A third consideration is that of setting guidelines, if necessary, for your work
group to follow when determining the most efficient copier use. It may be necessary
for you to establish a range of number of originals to be copied and the type of copier

to use in your department. For example, if fewer than fifty originals are to be copied,
use a desktop copier; if more than fifty originals are to be copied, use the in-house
copy center. If 500 or more copies are needed, consider using a high-volume copier.
This may sometimes mean contracting with an outside printing company.
Here are some tips to make the copying process efficient and economical:
• Copy when you have several items.
• Determine the best times to use the copier. Avoid high-traffic times.
• Keep track of the monitoring device assigned to you for copying purposes.
• Plan ahead for large copying needs.
• Make sure you comply with the Copyright Act.As a rule of thumb, you can pho-
tocopy from a published edition of more than ten pages, 10 percent of the total
number pages OR one chapter. If you are photocopying from a serial, then you
are allowed to photocopy one article from a single issue.
• Turn on the“Power Down”or“Standby”mode when you have finished copying.
• Do not photocopy with the lid up. Doing so isn’t good for your eyes.
• “Fan” the paper properly and place it correctly within the paper tray to pre-
vent jams.
• Keep all staples and paper clips away from your copier to avoid damage.
• Use the Lighter/Darker control on the display panel to adjust the tone of your
copies.
International Holidays and Mail Services
People who conduct international business know how important holiday infor-
mation can be when mailing or faxing important documents. Did you know that
more than 70 percent of holidays celebrated each year change from year to year?
Some countries have such diverse ethnic populations that they observe religious
holidays for ten or more major religions. How does this knowledge affect the way
you and your manager conduct your business communications?
A surprisingly common reason for getting no answer from an international

when the following urgent mail arrives:
• Certified Mail™requires a signature on delivery. The
sender paid a higher postage rate to ensure this piece of mail
would be delivered to the proper person.
• Overnight Mail has been delivered by a carrier, such as
UPS, or by USPS Express Mail®, so considered it to be urgent.
• Registered Mail™provides maximum protection and
security for valuables, irreplaceable, or otherwise important.
Because the sender has been provided with a mailing receipt
and its record is maintained by the USPS, consider the mail to
be urgent.
• Special Delivery items are delivered promptly after they
are received at the addressee’s post office. The sender has
paid a higher rate to ensure the article against loss or damage,
so recognize its importance when this item is delivered.

support six managers. Every day each manager re-
ceives at least twenty pieces of mail in addition to the
following: the Wall Street Journal, two or three
newsletters, two or three trade journals, and adver-
tisements. Three of the managers want you to log in
their important mail (important mail has not been
defined), and the other three managers need all the

Records Management
Information is at the center of everything an organization does; it’s the heartbeat
of an organization. How an organization manages its information can directly af-
fect its ability to compete, operate efficiently, comply with its own policies and
government regulations, and recover from disaster.
OVERVIEW OF A SYSTEM
An information system details how an organization plans, develops, and organizes
its information. Because information is recorded in many different ways, think
about how organizations must handle the following: customer records, invoices,
meeting notes from board meetings, e-mails, inventories, and personnel informa-
tion. Maintaining this information in an organized and secured manner is essen-
tial to organizations so it is useful and immediately available to the person
requesting the information at the right time.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide basic guidelines for establishing and
maintaining the records in your office by the most efficient and economical means
available.
You have very likely discovered, through the processing of your own school
papers, that if you allow your documents to accumulate haphazardly, you find
yourself wasting precious time, frantically sorting stacks of paper, or searching
electronic files in a last-minute effort to prepare for your final exams. The same
thing may be true in handling your personal business records when it comes time
for taxes. Similar panic can happen in an office when a letter, report, or form is
needed in a hurry and cannot be located or has been destroyed.
Part of today’s record problem is that federal, state, and municipal govern-
ments demand so much data from each business. Apart from the growing need for
businesses to supply government agencies with data and to maintain enormous
quantities of records to meet the government’s varying regulations, business
records have become increasingly more complex with the information explosion
of our world.
One way large organizations and businesses have reacted to the need to cope
with so many records has been for them to apply a “systems” approach. Records
and information management is the application of systematic control to recorded
information. It is a logical and practical approach to the creation, maintenance,
use, and disposition of records and, therefore, to the information those records
contain.
WHY IS RECORDS MANAGEMENT IMPORTANT?
An organization has a responsibility to manage its records, also called information
assets, effectively to maximize profit, control cost, and ensure the vitality of the or-
ganization. Effective records management ensures that the information needed is
retrievable, authentic, and accurate. An effective records management system re-
quires an organization to:
• set and follow policies.
• identify who is responsible and accountable for managing records.
• create, communicate, and follow procedures consistently throughout all
departments.

Records Management
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING RECORDS
AND INFORMATION?
Every employee is responsible. Everyone plays an important role in protecting the
organization’s records and information by following its established policies and
executing its procedures.
Many large businesses find it productive and cost-effective to designate one
employee to supervise the management of records for the entire organization. In
these large organizations, the records manager supervises all the organization’s
files. He or she also determines how the files will be maintained and who will main-
tain them, how long each record is to be kept, and when a record is to be removed
to an inactive area or made ready for more permanent storage or destruction.
The rapid expansion of information in many fields has created a need for more
specialization in records and information management careers, such as records man-
ager or records coordinator.The opportunity for a career path depends on the size of
the business, industry, or organization and whether a company maintains its own
records or engages in outsourcing. Regardless, positions exist for professionals, rang-
ing from the highest level position of a records and information supervisor (manager
or director) to the lowest-level position of a records center clerk. As businesses, in-
dustries, and organizations have become more aware of how the records and infor-
mation management system contributes to the success and productivity of a business,
they have become more aware of the importance of their records professionals.
If your company does not have a records manager or does not contract with a
records consultant, you may be called upon to complete one or all of these tasks:
1. Revise or create a filing system.
2. Select filing supplies and equipment.
3. Standardize filing procedures.
4. Develop the arrangement of records in a sequence so they can be retrieved
quickly.
WHAT ARE RECORDS?
Records are the evidence of what the organization does. They represent its busi-
ness activities and decisions or transactions, such as correspondence and financial
statements. Records appear in many formats:
• physical paper such as letters, and contracts;
• electronic mail;
• databases.
When there is a lawsuit, all of these records, including copies that employees have
retained and any items deleted from the system, could be used against the organiza-
tion. For example, Philip Morris USA/Altria Group in July 2004 deleted e-mail that
was over sixty days old for more than two years after a legal order was issued to pre-
serve all documents relating to litigation. The company failed to follow its own in-
ternal procedures for document and e-mail preservation and was fined $2.75 million.
CATEGORIES OF RECORDS
Determining the categories of records helps an office professional know whether
a record is to be kept, where it is to be stored, how it will be stored, and how long
it will be retained. For example, paper or electronic advertisements, requests, and
317

inquiries have little or no future use or value to an organization and should not be
kept. Many of these documents are taking up space in office filing cabinets. Stop
and think about the time it takes you to file this type of material, the supplies and
equipment needed, and the expensive space it requires. However, think about a
company’s contracts, personnel records, and formal meeting minutes from board
meetings. These records are evidence of transactions and decisions made for and
by the company and are of value.
Categorizing records as to their current and future usefulness and legal impli-
cations is necessary to save your organization money in terms of employee time,
supplies, equipment, and expensive space. To be effective in managing records, the
first step is to consider how records are categorized so you will know what is to
be kept short term, permanently, or discarded. Four common categories are vital,
important, useful, and nonessential.
Vital Records
Vital records include records that are essential to the operation of the organization
or to the continuation or resumption of operations; the re-creation of the legal or
financial status of the organization; or the fulfillment of its obligations to stock-
holders and employees in the event of a disaster.Vital records may pertain to prop-
erty, patents, copyrights, insurance, tax, and accounts receivable. Vital records
should be identified and stored in a separate location for safekeeping.Vital records
may include backup or copying essential computer databases and files (both pa-
per and electronic).
Important Records
Important records, such as customer and inventory records, are meaningful to the
business operation but must be limited as to the length of time they are retained.
Useful Records
Useful records are documents, such as correspondence and reports that are
needed to conduct the daily business operations. Important and useful paper
records are maintained in fire-resistant file cabinets and are kept on-site; any elec-
tronic important and useful records are backed up or copied using the appropri-
ate storage media.
Nonessential Records
Nonessential records are not needed beyond their current use and should be dis-
carded after their use because they cost money in space, equipment, and employee
time. Examples of nonessential records are requests, acknowledgments, notices of
staff meetings, and duplicate copies of correspondence.
FILES MANAGEMENT
Files management is integral to records management. Files management applies
records management principles to both paper and electronic records created and
used by a single office. Files management ensures that records can be retrieved ef-
ficiently when needed. A well-designed filing system can produce time savings in
faster filing and information retrieval, fewer misfiles, and higher staff efficiency
and productivity.
An ideal filing system is comprised exclusively of records but only the ones that
provide value to the organization. Although almost every bit of information you
create or receive, regardless of its paper or electronic format, is considered a

document. Unlike records, some documents should not be filed. A number of doc-
uments are created or kept for convenience or reference and can be destroyed at
any time. Common examples of documents include
• duplicates such as completed forms, extra copies of reports, and bulletins;
• versions of reports that have been through several rounds of editing or prelim-
inary drafts;
• miscellaneous notices, such as announcements of meetings, confirmations, and
acknowledgments;
• requests for information or responses to requests (discarded after the informa-
tion has been sent or received).
To ensure faster retrieval and filing of information, eliminate these documents
from your filing system. Eliminating these documents also reduces the need for ex-
tra computer memory, filing cabinet space, and filing supplies. For purposes in this
chapter, the terms record and document are used interchangeably.
Managing Paper Records
DEVELOPING A FILING SYSTEM
Incoming information includes e-mail; USPS mail; other mail from special deliv-
ery services, fax, and voice mail messages (written or keyboarded); and copies of
documents. There are tips for writing documents that either would be distributed
within the company or sent outside the company. When handling both incoming
and outgoing information, you must determine a system for filing these records.
The major arrangements, also called classifications and systems, are alpha-
betic, numeric, geographic, and subject. There is another arrangement called
chronological (tickler and pending). The arrangements are often used in combina-
tion with one another.

FIGURE 1 • An alphabetic system for a small office.
Before deciding on a particular filing system, consider the following questions:
• How will the records be requested? By name, number, geographic location, or sub-
ject or a combination? For instance, will you search your system for your customer
by name or number, or will you search for your customer by geographic location?
• How will the records be retrieved? Paper or electronically?
Alphabetic
The alphabetic filing system is one of the most commonly used systems to
retrieve records by name or topic and uses the alphabet to sequence personal,
business, and government names. Figure 1 shows an alphabetic arrangement for
a small office.
The alphabetic system has the following advantages:
• Alphabetic filing is direct because you can go to the file and locate an item with-
out having to first refer to an index. An index is a listing of the filed items.
• All other arrangements are directly or indirectly combined with the alphabetic
system.
Some of the disadvantages include
• Because the record is filed alphabetically by name, each individual using the
arrangement files records according to the alphabetic scheme he or she believes
appropriate. If everyone doesn’t strictly follow a uniform set of rules for alpha-
betizing records, individuals could place files in many possible locations, mak-
ing retrieval inefficient.
• Expansion may create problems when the expansion takes place in a section of
paper files where there is no space to insert additional folders.
• Confidentiality of the files cannot be guaranteed because the file folder labels
can be seen by anyone retrieving a file.

FIGURE 3 • Alphabetic listing of names.
Numeric
In the numeric filing system, material is filed in some logical numerical order. Ex-
amples of users include insurance companies that keep records according to policy
numbers, medical offices that assign a number to each patient, and legal firms that
assign a case number to each client. See an example of numeric filing in Figure 2.
Another example is shown in Figure 3.
Numbers are assigned in two ways: straight digit and terminal digit.
Straight-digit filing shows digits usually run together on the label; however,
they are read by groups of digits from left to right. For example, a client’s number
543689 is read as 54 36 89.
Terminal-digit filing divides numbers into groups of digits that point to the lo-
cation of the records. For example, let’s use the file number above—543689. It
will look the same, but it will be read and filed in reverse order from right to left:
89 36 54.

Here is an example of how straight-digit filing and terminal-digit filing work.
Let’s suppose Brent has to file numerically the following records:
The numeric filing system has the following advantages:
• It is well suited for records with identification numbers, for rapidly expanding
files, and in conjunction with data processing systems.
• There are no duplicates of numbers as there can be with names.
• It is easier to notice a filing error with numbers.
• Security is greater because the file name does not reveal anything about
its contents.
• Numeric filing is the fastest to use and results in the fewest errors. Coupled with
shelf filing equipment and color coding, numeric filing systems simplify docu-
ment processing.
• It is easy to expand the system.
Disadvantages include the following:
• You must use an index, as shown in Figure 3, listing the names to which the
number is assigned. For this reason, a numeric system is called indirect filing.
• You must use a register, often called an accession register or master index, to
show the next number available for assignment.
Geographic
The geographic filing system is commonly used by sales and marketing personnel
and others who are concerned with the location of companies and individuals. Us-
ing this arrangement, you file material alphabetically in some logical pattern, such
as by city, state, or region or territory. An example of a geographic filing system is
shown in Figure 4.
The geographical filing system has the following advantages:
• It allows for direct filing if the location is known.
• It provides easy access because groups of records are filed together.
Some disadvantages include
• An index is required if the location is not known.
• Sorting the records by city, state, territory, or region increases the possibility
of error.
Subject
The subject filing system allows you to file records alphabetically according to the
main subject because the subject is considered to be more important than the in-
dividual or business name. Companies that deal with products, supplies, advertis-
ing, and so forth use subject arrangements. Subject files are popular with travel

agencies for filing brochures by destination, such as Las Vegas, San Francisco, or
Seattle. An example of a subject file is shown in Figure 5.
Among the advantages of the subject filing system:
• Access is easy because subject filing relates to groups of records.
• Subdivisions easily expand the system.
The subject filing system has the following disadvantages:
• It requires an index to file or retrieve files by firm name when the subject is
unknown.
• It is difficult to classify records by subject; therefore, time is lost while someone
searches for a file under a number of subject choices.

As mentioned earlier, filing systems may be combined. For example, for a de-

reflect a subject such as insurance. It may be assigned a label of 34. Insurance, with
all other folders shown as 34.1 Auto Insurance, 34.2 Health Insurance, and so on.
Decimal-numeric filing, also known as the Dewey Decimal System, works
with subject filing to permit more expansion than a basic numeric system. For in-
stance, you might assign number 500 to Office Equipment. The following exam-
ple shows the numeric assignment to the main heading, major divisions, and first
division for Office Equipment.
Which is the best system to use? Without specific policies, procedures, or
guidelines, you must decide on the method that best suits the type of business, the
type of paper records being filed, the way in which they are used, and the method
that ensures the fastest storing and retrieval.
LOCATION OF PAPER RECORDS
Suppose your records manager resigned last week, and you were asked to join a
team charged with the responsibility of merging three workgroups’ records. Your
team’s main task is to determine if all the paper records should be kept in one area
or in individual offices. In other words, should the records be centralized, decen-
tralized, or perhaps use a combination of both?
In considering location, your team should answer the following:
• Who needs to have access to the records?
• What types of records are stored?
324

Records Management
• How frequently will the records need to be accessed?
• What procedures are needed to protect the files from loss, damage, theft, and
unauthorized use?
Centralization
In a centralized filing system, records are placed in one central location that is
convenient for a group of people who must work with the same information. In
a centralized filing system, an individual must be designated as the one respon-
sible for the system. To use this system effectively, establish procedures for
retrieval, or obtaining filed records for use. The electronic equivalent to central-
ized filing would be a shared directory, also called a folder, that is part of a lo-
cal area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Advantages include the
following:
• greater control over the records;
• storage of records with less equipment and space;
• more readily achieved uniformity and consistency.
Decentralization
In a decentralized filing system, individuals or very small groups of employees
maintain files at their workstations. An example would be a small department
where several assistants maintain correspondence and project records at their
workstations. Advantages include the following:
• Records are more accessible.
• Limited access to a record provides greater security and confidentiality.
The main disadvantage is that more copying is required to allow others access
to materials, and if the filing task is not done on a regular basis, the information
requested may not be readily available.
It is possible for an office to have both a centralized and decentralized filing
system.The majority of the records may be filed centrally, whereas a specific group
of records, such as for a project, is located near its primary user.
FILING SUPPLIES
After determining a filing system for managing your paper records, it is important
to select appropriate supplies.

ORDERING SUPPLIES ONLINE
Products for both paper and electronic filing should make your systems more or-
ganized, efficient, effective, and interesting. There are numerous products, styles,
sizes, and shapes available to make a filing system work well for the organization.
Many products will be available at the local office supplies store; however, to get
the greatest variety in products, use e-commerce—shop online through the Internet.
Online shopping for your supplies has a number of advantages:
• The catalog will be dynamic. In other words, the pictures, descriptions, and
prices displayed online will be up to date. With a conventional paper catalog,
the information is often out of date before it’s printed.
• Finding what you need is simple. Office supply sites have indexes that you sim-
ply click on to view the products.
• Online sites give you greater variety. With so many sites online, it’s easy to get
exactly what you want. The variety of product is excellent.
• The delivery is fast since the online companies use courier services (or their own
service) to get the package to your office. Because of the competition among the
online supply stores, customer service tends to be very good.
• Online products usually cost less than those in a conventional store since the
suppliers do not have the same expenses—fewer employees, no magazine print-
ing costs, no rent for store space, etc.
Examples of online shopping sites that offer the latest products in both paper
and electronic filing supplies are
• www.staples.com
• www.officedepot.com
• www.officemax.com
The following is a brief discussion of some basic items that are essential to
manage your system. Once you have the basics, you will need to enhance and im-
prove on what you have.
Basic Folder Designs
Folders, also referred to as manila folders, are the containers for holding the pa-
per. Because folders tend to take a lot of abuse, they are produced using many
different weights of paper. Folders come with tabs, which are the extensions at
the top of the folders. A tab holds a label to identify the folder’s contents and is
available in different widths called tab cuts; for example, if the tab is one-fifth
as wide as the folder, it is called one-fifth. Figure 6 shows some of the possible
tab cuts.
Hanging folders are suspended by extensions at their top edges across a metal
frame within the file drawer, which means they don’t rest on the bottom of the cab-
inet. Records filed in hanging folders are easily accessible because the folders open
wide and slide smoothly on the hanger rail. Attachable tabs are inserted into slots
at the top of the folders and are used in place of conventional guides with tabs.
Guides
Dividers in traditional filing drawers or compartments are called guides. They
serve as signposts, separating the filing space into labeled sections. Guides also
support the folders in an upright position.

FIGURE 6 • Examples of tab cuts.
Guides have a tab projecting from the edge, which is available in a variety of
sizes and colors. Whereas you can purchase blank tabs in order to customize your
system, you can also purchase tabs that list the days of the week, the names of
months, or numbers.
Guides for open-shelf filing differ from guides for vertical file drawers. Note
the tabs on the guides are along the side and not on the top, as they would be on
vertical files.
PLACEMENT OF GUIDES AND FOLDERS
The supplies you need to set up the simplest system in strict sequential order for
filing records in regular folders are
• primary guides—at least one for each letter of the alphabet;
• individual name folders;
• miscellaneous folders;
• special guides.
Primary Guides
A primary guide divides a file into alphabetic sections and is placed at the begin-
ning of each section. Guides direct the eye to the section of the file in which the
folder being sought is located.
Guides are not needed with hanging folders, as the folders are supported from
a metal frame, and the guide tabs are attached directly to the folders. When guides
are used, a record is filed in either individual or miscellaneous folders placed
behind the guides.
Individual Folder
An individual name folder is used when you accumulate at least five records for
one customer, for example, or when you determine from the current letter or

report that much communication will take place between the individual and your
manager. In this case, prepare an individual folder with the name typed in indexed
order in the caption.
Arrange individual folders in order immediately following the appropriate pri-
mary guide, as shown in Figure 7. File records within individual folders in chrono-
logical order, so the correspondence bearing the most recent date is placed at the
front of the folder.
Miscellaneous Folders
For every primary guide in your file, there should be a miscellaneous folder with
a caption corresponding to the caption on the primary guide. Miscellaneous folders
belong behind individual folders and contain the papers to and from all corre-
spondents for whom you do not have individual name folders.
Within a miscellaneous folder, arrange the records in alphabetical order by
name. When you have two or more records for one individual, arrange them in
chronological order, so the one with the most recent date will be in front of the
others. Staple related papers together to increase the ease of locating them.
328

Records Management
Special Guides
The special guide directs the eye to individual folders that are used frequently. Spe-
cial guides are also used for subdivisions of the alphabet, or to mark the section of
a file containing individual folders for several individuals with the same surname.
FILE LABELS
Labels are used to help identify a folder and its contents. Labels come in a variety
of sizes, shapes, and colors so you can customize your filing system to meet the
needs of your office. Colors should not be used at random. Use colors to represent
a topic or the status of a file.
For paper files, identification and labeling allows an office to maintain con-
trol over current files and manage growth of new files. Labeling serves as a vi-
sual aid by identifying individual folders and groups of folders within the
system.
For electronic files, labeling serves as an access tool that allows individual doc-
uments to be retrieved in an efficient manner. Electronic files follow many of the
same filing identification and labeling guidelines as paper files. Records are or-
ganized by directories, also called folders. Finally, each folder contains individual
records or documents.
When working with paper files, three levels of file identification help sim-
plify filing and retrieval: drawer or shelf labels, file guide labels, and file folder
labels.
Key the names on the labels in the indexed order, which will be explained later
in this chapter. Capitalize the first letter of each word because words keyed in all-
capital letters are sometimes difficult to read. If your labels consist of only one or
two words and you use an easy-to-read font, full capitalization will work well.
Above all, remember to be consistent with labeling throughout your system. The
captions on the labels of the folders should resemble an aligned list of names, as
shown in Figure 8.
Label drawers or sections of files in uppercase with either open or close nota-
tions. A typical example of an open notation would be:
CORRESPONDENCE
Gunter, Joe
Gray, Thomas
Gray, Marion
Gilbert, William T

FILING EQUIPMENT
When selecting filing equipment, consider the following:
• volume of records requiring storage;
• types of records being stored;
• space limitations.
As you have learned, paper records are usually filed vertically, standing upright
and supported by guides and folders in file drawers.
Vertical Drawer Cabinets
Vertical drawer cabinets, often referred to as standard cabinets, are popular in
small offices. They have two, four, or five drawers. A typical four-drawer cabinet

can store approximately one hundred inches of files and requires 5.8 square feet
of floor space (with drawer extended).The cabinet can be moved easily and locked
for security.
Lateral Cabinets
Lateral cabinets, shown in Figure 9, often referred to as horizontal files or open-
sided cabinets, also are popular in small offices. They allow files to be accessed
horizontally or vertically. A typical five-drawer lateral cabinet can
store almost 2.5 times more than a vertical drawer cabinet and re-
quires 6.8 square feet of floor space. Like the vertical filing cabi-
net, this cabinet can be moved easily and locked for security.
Open Shelves
Open-shelving equipment, which resembles open bookshelves, is
usually found in large offices and in central file rooms. Refer to
Figure 10. The advantage of this type of lateral file allows files to
be retrieved horizontally and allows full viewing of the folder tabs
for rapid retrieval. A 50 percent space savings is estimated when
converting from a vertical system to an open-shelf system. Open
shelves do not offer security for confidential or vital records; thus,
a reason for using a numeric filing system.
Mobile Aisle Systems
Mobile aisle systems are considered when access to large quantities
of files is desired and space is at a premium. For example, hospitals
still use this type of storage. These units, which can be automated,
work on tracks that move back and forth to conserve floor space.
This equipment usually requires professional installation.
FIGURE 10 • Open-shelving equipment.
Indexing and Alphabetizing Rules
Standardization of alphabetic filing rules is essential because it allows filing to be
consistent and efficient.The Association of Records Managers and Administrators
(ARMA) recognized the need for standardization and so published the first rules
for alphabetic filing. Although the association still refers to itself as ARMA, it has
expanded its role to include training, publications, and development of ethics and
standardization of the most sophisticated records management systems. The full
name for ARMA is now the Association for Information Management Profes-
sionals. However, because the name ARMA is so highly respected and recognized,
it’s likely that the ARMA acronym will continue to be used for years to come. The

best way to contact ARMA is through its Web site at www.arma.org. The alpha-

suggested by ARMA.
ORDER OF FILING UNITS
Before you begin learning the rules, study the following terms.
Unit
Each part of a name that is used to determine the filing order is called a unit.
For example, the name B. R. Grove has three units: B., R., Grove. The busi-
ness name Wacky Wig Boutique has three units: Wacky, Wig, Boutique.
Indexing
Names are not always filed the same way they are written. In preparation for al-
phabetic filing, the format and order of a name is often altered. The process of ar-
ranging units of a name in order for filing purposes is referred to as indexing, as
defined earlier. An example of indexing is where B. R. Grove is indexed as Grove
B. R. Indexing always precedes alphabetizing.
Alphabetic Filing
Placing names in an A-to-Z sequence is considered alphabetizing. This process is
necessary to maintain an alphabetic filing system. For example, placing the name
Adamson before the name Bolton is alphabetizing.
This process appears relatively simple; however, because the English language
is made up of words from other languages, word derivatives, prefixes, suffixes,
compound words, and other combinations, the filing process may become com-
plicated and inconsistent unless rules are applied.
GENERAL ALPHABETIC INDEXING PRINCIPLES
Following the four general principles will help you to apply the filing rules.
1. Alphabetize by comparing names unit by unit and letter by letter.
When first
units are identical, move on to compare the second units; when second units
332

Records Management

Peter
Black
Jeff

are identical, compare third units, and so on. For example, in comparing the
following indexed names, you would need to make the distinction in the third
unit because the first and second units are identical.
Unit 1
Unit 2
Unit 3
Ross
William
Ross
William
Robert
Unit 1
Unit 2
Unit 3
Chatham
Bus
Depot
Chatham
Business
College
2. Nothing comes before something.
Thus, in comparing the following in-
dexed names, you would file a folder labeled Ross William first since the first
two units are identical and Ross William does not have a third unit. Nothing
is filed before something.
Another example of this principle would be:
In this case, Bus would come before Business under the principle that
nothing comes before something.
3. All punctuation marks, special characters, and diacritical marks should be ig-
nored when indexing.
Examples of punctuation marks found in names in-
clude periods, apostrophes, quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, and accent
marks. Where words have been separated by a hyphen or dash, consider them
together as one indexing unit, for example, Ellison-Parker.
4. Numbers.
Arabic (1, 2, 3) and Roman (I, II, III) numbers are filed sequen-
tially before alphabetic characters. All Arabic numerals precede all Roman
numerals.
ALPHABETIC FILING RULES
Learning to apply the following rules will help you to file all your paper records
in nearly all situations. ARMA outlines a few exceptions to these rules. If you have
a particular situation that requires an exception to a rule, refer to ARMA rules. To
simplify this section, all the exceptions have not been included.The following rules
have been organized into three categories:
A. Personal Names,
B. Business and Organization Names,
C. Government and Political Designations.
A. Specific Filing Rules for Personal Names
Rule A1: Names of Individuals
The surname (last name) is the first filing unit, followed by the first name or ini-
tial, and then the middle name or initial. Because nothing comes before something,
initials (such as M) are filed before a name (such as Martha) that begins with the
same letter.

Rule A2: Personal Names with Prefixes
Surnames that include a prefix are filed as one unit, even if a space or punctuation
follows the prefix. Examples of prefixes are D’, da, de, Del, Du, La, Les, Mac, Mc,
O’, Saint, San, St., Van, Van de, and Von der and are filed with the surname as one
unit regardless of whether the surname is written as one word or two. Ignore any
apostrophe or space that appears within or after the prefix.

Rule A3: Titles and Suffixes
Titles and suffixes are not used as filing units except when needed to distinguish
between two or more identical names. When needed, the title or suffix is the last
filing unit and is filed as written without punctuation.
Rule A4: Hyphenated Names
Remove the hyphen, combine the names, and file as one unit.

Rule A6: Non-English Names
If the surname is identifiable, file the name as any other personal name. If the
surname is uncertain, use the last name as the first filing unit and cross-reference
(filing a record by a secondary name) the name as written. More in-depth infor-
mation is provided in a later section in this chapter.
Rule A5: Pseudonyms, Royal, or Religious Titles
Pseudonyms (fictitious name assumed by an author) are filed as written. Personal
names that begin with royal or religious titles and are followed by only a given
name(s) are filed as written.
Rule A7: Nicknames
When a person commonly uses a nickname as a first name, file using the nickname.
Include a cross-reference to the given name only if necessary.
B. Specific Filing Rules for Business and Organization Names
Rule B1: Names of Businesses and Organizations
Names of businesses and organizations are indexed in a similar fashion to the
names of individuals. However, names of businesses and organizations should be
indexed in the order they are written by the business or organization. Therefore, a
surname is not necessarily the first unit. If you are unsure of the correct wording
or format, refer to the company’s letterhead or business card, or make a telephone
call to the business or organization’s receptionist. For filing business and organi-
zational names with prefixes, see Rule A2.
When the name begins with The, place that word at the end as the last index-
ing unit.
When names of businesses and organizations are identical, indexing order is
determined by the address. If the names of cities are identical, indexing order de-
pends on names of states, followed by street names and building numbers. When

The following rules apply in specific filing circumstances.
Rule B4: Numeric Names
Names containing numbers are filed alphabetically.

street names are written as digits (13th Street), the street names are considered in
ascending order and filed before alphabetic street names. Street names with com-
pass directions are indexed as written.
Rule B2: Geographic Names
When filing geographic names, follow the general rules.
Rule B3: Compass Terms
Each word/unit in a filing segment containing compass terms is considered a sep-
arate filing unit. If the term includes more than one compass point, file it as writ-
ten. Prepare cross-reference as needed.

Rule B6: Single Letters in Names
Single letters appearing in company names are filed as separate units, even though
they may be written together without spaces.
C. Specific Filing Rules for Governmental and Political Designations
When filing governmental or political records, the name of the major entity is filed
first and followed by the distinctive name of the department, bureau, and so on.
This rule applies to all governmental and political divisions, agencies, departments,
and committees from the federal to the county/parish, city district, and ward levels.
Rule C1: Federal Government
For the correct hierarchical order, consult the most current edition of the United
States Government Manual (USGM). Generally, indexing of the federal govern-
ment agencies is done first by United States Government followed by the most
distinctive name, such as Department, Bureau, Agency, and so on.
Rule C2: State and Local Governments
Index state, county, town, and city governments or political divisions by their dis-
tinctive names. To avoid confusion and to ensure efficient, accurate information
retrieval, add the words State of, County of, and so on and consider them as filing
units. Index the words State, Department, County, and Bureau after the distinc-
tive name. If of is not part of the official name, do not use it for indexing.

Rule C3: Non-U.S. Governments

Following the rules explained in this section will ensure consistency in filing.
Everyone sharing responsibility for filing and retrieving information must thor-
oughly understand the system. If you are working and needing periodic refresher
training in proper filing and retrieval, discuss your need with your supervisor.Your
supervisor understands the need for efficiency and effectiveness in filing and re-
trieving information.
VARIATIONS IN ALPHABETIC FILING RULES
Because conflicts in alphabetic indexing have existed for many years and continue
to exist, you need to be aware of the conflicts as well as the standardized rules.
When you report for a new work assignment, you will have to retrieve documents
that have been filed by someone else. Furthermore, the organization for which you
work may have its own rules for indexing and alphabetizing. If so, learn them and
apply them, so that the files you maintain will be consistent with the other files in
the organization.
Watch for the following variations in indexing and alphabetizing names of
individuals:
1. The hyphenated surname of an individual might be treated as separate units
rather than one filing unit.
2. The name of a married woman might be filed under her husband’s name in-
stead of her own name.
There are many variations in the alphabetic filing rules for businesses, institu-
tions, and other group names.
1. Each part of a hyphenated business name made up of surnames might be in-
dexed as a separate filing unit, instead of the hyphenated name being treated
as one filing unit.
2. Geographic names beginning with prefixes might be filed as two separate
units rather than one.
3. Geographic names that are spelled as either one or two English words—such
as Mountain View and Mountainview—might be filed inconsistently, with the
result that documents pertaining to one business are filed in two different
places.
4. Names beginning with numbers expressed in figures, as opposed to written
out, might be filed in regular alphabetical sequence with all the numbers
spelled out in full rather than filed in strict numeric sequence preceding the
entire alphabetic file.
5. The s following an apostrophe might be disregarded so the word is indexed
without the s.
338

Records Management
PREPARING PAPER RECORDS FOR FILING
Once you have decided which records are to be managed, you must establish a pro-
cedure for preparing the records to be filed. The following six steps will help you
prepare your records for filing:
1. Examine.
2. Index.
3. Code.
4. Cross-reference.
5. Sort.
6. File.
Examine
You will want to make certain the item is ready for filing. Follow these guidelines
to examine each item.
• Check items that are stapled together and decide if they should be filed together.
• Staple together related papers where one record refers to the other.
• Remove all paper clips and extra staples as these supplies use extra space and
can hang on other records.
• Remove small slips of paper that are no longer needed, such as a slip marked
“Please file.”
• Keep the routing slip with the appropriate documents. You may need to deter-
mine later to whom the document was circulated.
• Determine if documents are duplicates and should be deleted/destroyed or filed.
Index
In a previous section, you learned indexing occurs when you determine the order
and format of the units in a name when alphabetizing. Careful indexing is the most
important part of filing. You have learned a record with a name of Benjamin Ross
would be indexed as Ross Benjamin according to the rules. The most important
word for filing is Ross.
When you are filing correspondence by name, note the following:
1. Incoming letters are often called for by the name of the organization appear-
ing in the letterhead, so index them by the name of the organization in the
letterhead.
2. Outgoing letters are often called for by the name of the organization appear-
ing in the inside address, so index them by the name of the organization in the
inside address.
To learn how to index for the variety of names you will encounter, follow the
standardized indexing rules presented earlier in this chapter.
Code
After you decide how a record should be filed, mark the indexing caption on it.
This process is called coding. To code by name, highlight, underscore, circle, or
write the indexed name. The code on the record should be complete enough that

you can return the record to the same folder each time it has been removed.As you
study the indexing rules, you will learn how to determine the order of units within
a name.
Cross-Reference
When a document is apt to be called for by two different names at different times,
you should be able to locate it by looking under either name. To make this possi-
ble, file the record according to the caption (the name arranged in index order) by
which it is most likely to be requested. Also, file a reference to it by a second name.
This task is referred to as cross-referencing.
The purpose of cross-referencing is to send you to the correct file and elimi-
nate filing similar documents in more than one place. An electronic or paper card
filing system is an effective way to manage cross-referencing.
To make a cross-reference card, use a card of the same size as the primary card
in the file but use a different color. Notice in Figure 11 the two cards prepared for
Maclean Hunter Ltd. The information printed below SEE on the cross-reference
card is the caption on the original card.
Avoid preparing unnecessary cross-references, but if you are in doubt, make
one. There are various situations in which cross-referencing is necessary. Consider
the following:
1. Correspondence pertaining to individuals may be filed by subject (for exam-
ple, Temporary Employees) instead of by name.
2. It may be difficult to determine the individual’s surname. Consider the name
Kent Ross. Is the surname Ross or Kent? If the surname is Ross, the correct
file will read Ross, Kent and the cross-reference file label will read Kent, Ross.
Inside the folder, the cross-reference sheets will read:
SEE ROSS, KENT
3. A married woman may be known by
a. her maiden name; for example, in the name Ms. Heather Ross, the name
is indexed as Ross, Heather (Ms).
340

Records Management
b. her married name; for example, in the name Mrs. Heather Whyte, the name
is indexed as Whyte, Heather (Mrs).
c. her husband’s name; for example, in the name Mrs. Robert Whyte, the
name would be indexed as Whyte, Robert (Mrs).
A cross-reference will be necessary for two of the three cases. Most com-
monly, correspondence would be filed under either Ross, Heather (Ms) or
Whyte, Heather (Mrs). Only one of these files should contain documents; the
other two must serve as cross-references.
4. Subdivisions of a parent company are filed under the name used on their let-
terhead; they are not filed under the parent company name. To avoid confu-
sion, file correctly under the name of the subdivision, but prepare a
cross-reference for the name of the parent company. For example, a subdivi-
sion business called Office Supply Town with a parent company called Office
Supply Enterprises would have the correspondence filed as Office Supply
Town, but a cross-reference sheet would be placed in the Office Supply En-
terprises folder to send anyone to the Office Supply Town folder.
5. Some organizations are referred to by their acronym because they are better
known that way. An example is IAAP (International Association of Adminis-
trative Professionals). It is acceptable to file the correspondence under either
name; however, it is best to check the organization’s letterhead or business card
to see how the organization refers to itself. Whether you file by the full name
or by the popular abbreviation, consistency must prevail. A cross-reference will
be necessary to keep all the correspondence or records in the same file.
6. A business name may include several surnames. For Johnson, Baines, and
Strafford, file the original by Johnson and cross-reference Baines and Strafford.
7. A company may change its name. File by the new name, and record the date
of the change. Retain the old name in the files as a cross-reference only.
8. Names of foreign companies and government agencies are often written in
both English and the respective foreign language. For a government agency,
file the original paper by the English name, and place a cross-reference sheet
in the folder with the foreign spelling.
9. For a foreign company, file the original by the name as it is written and the
cross-reference sheet in the folder under the English translation.
10. When a department is renamed because of restructuring within the organization,
internal correspondence filed by subject is often affected.File the correspondence
by the new name; however, retain the old name in the files as a cross-reference.
Sort
Using the code marks mentioned previously as a guide, prearrange the records in
the same order in which they will eventually be filed. This preliminary arrange-
ment is called sorting. By sorting the records carefully, you will eliminate unnec-
essary shifting back and forth, from drawer to drawer or from shelf to shelf, as you
file them. As a result, you will be working efficiently and saving time.
Horizontal and vertical sorters can expedite the process; these devices, such as
trays and booklets, use dividers that are labeled either alphabetically or numeri-
cally, to sort records.
File
After records are sorted, they are ready to be filed. Filing is the actual placing of
records in folders. It involves classifying, arranging, and storing materials according

to a systematic plan for quick reference. Here are a few tips to follow to help you in
handling your filing task:
• When refiling existing records, the name on the caption in the filing system
should be the same as the record being refiled.
• Records should be filed chronologically in the folder,with the latest one in the front.
• New records may require the creation of a new folder. The new folder should
agree with the current filing system and the index should be updated to include
this file.
In addition, keep the following pointers in mind:
• Keep up with your filing on a daily basis. Allow at least thirty minutes a day to
file. When unfiled papers stack up, a simple task becomes a burden. You will
spend much more time locating a record when it is in an unarranged stack than
when it is properly placed in a folder. Note also that you run the risk of losing
papers when they are disorganized.
• Listen carefully, ask questions, and take notes if someone is explaining the fil-
ing system to you. In any new office job, you will be placing and locating ma-
terials in the files that were maintained by your predecessor. Study the system
and learn it quickly so you can file your records efficiently. Do not try to reor-
ganize the files in your office until you are familiar with what they contain.
• If you have suggestions for improving the filing system, jot down your ideas and
bring them to the attention of your team members or supervisor at an appro-
priate time.
TRACKING PAPER FILES
When someone removes a file folder, you need a system for tracking the file.
Charge-out methods, manual and automated, allow you to track files.
A manual system uses special cards, folders, and pressboard guides with the
word OUT printed on the tabs to substitute for papers and folders taken from a spe-
cific location. When only a few sheets of paper are removed from the files, an OUT
card is used; when the entire folder is removed, either an OUT folder or an OUT
guide is substituted. Review Figure 1. Charge-out guides include the following:
• Guides with printed lines for writing a description of the materials removed, the
name of the person who has taken the file or the materials, and the date removed.
• Guides with a slot or a pocket to hold a card. The charge-out information is
written on the card.
342

Describe two types of charge-out methods.
a. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________
b. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Understanding Electronic File Organization
The dynamics of the electronic environment, also called the e-environment, char-
acterized by the empowered end users with a PC on their desk, mean documents
can be readily created, easily amended or discarded without a trace, and can be
shared much more widely than in the past.
In either case, the guides are placed into the filing system to take the place of
the folders that have been removed. The OUT card or guide remains in the file un-
til the charged-out material is returned. Both types are reusable.
In large organizations, file tracking software uses barcode technology to mon-
itor the movement, filing, location, archival, retention, and destruction of docu-
ments, files, cases, and archive boxes. You are familiar with barcodes as they are
on grocery product labels, clothing, etc. Using barcode technology, an organiza-
tion can identify and track any item such as client or customer files, internal doc-
uments, forms, drawings, working papers, incoming mail, and archived materials.
So bar coding can expedite the check-in and check-out process. Each document is
given a unique barcode to identify it, or grouped together to form projects or cases.
An item may then be registered at a location simply by scanning its barcode iden-
tification label. Bar coding virtually eliminates lost files.The software also can pro-
duce reports to show what was requested and by whom.
Microsoft® Office Files and Bar Codes
You can insert a barcode into a document using Microsoft® Office 2007 Word,
Excel, or PowerPoint. The ability to insert a barcode is available only under cer-
tain circumstances. For more information, visit Microsoft®’s Web site at http://
office.microsoft.com and search for barcode.
Regardless of the charge-out system you use, do not hesitate to use it if you
have frequent requests to borrow materials from a folder or the folder itself.
Color Coding
Color coding can be applied to any paper filing system. It is popular
because it provides easy identification for sorting,filing,and finding;
it confirms that the folders have been filed in the right places.
Color can:
✓Code the first two or three digits in numeric filing systems.
✓Code the first two letters of a name in an alphabetic filing system.
✓Differentiate similar types of records that belong to various 
departments.
✓Identify records that were temporarily removed from files.
✓Check the filing methods of new employees.
343

Records Management
A great concern for organizations is that the majority of the information elec-
tronically stored can be a record or act as a record but are not necessarily captured
into an organization’s formal record-keeping system. What would be the effect if
25 percent of a typical organization’s information, much of which again might be
in the form of records, is stored on single user storage media such as hard disk
drives? What a shock it would be if your company were to do a records survey and
learned more than 50 percent of its information was stored on single-user PCs and
20 of the 50 percent was identified as vital, important, and useful records. As you
have learned earlier, certain records should become part of a formal record-keeping
system so they can be managed. Not only are they to be managed, but they may
be needed in legal situations.
Understanding the importance of your file management system is critical in the
electronic environment. Whether you are new to your organization or have been
employed for some time, you must ensure you are following specific naming and
saving rules or procedures, if provided, for electronic filing within your organiza-
tion. If rules or procedures are not available, ask your supervisor if he or she
knows a specific individual to contact in your organization.
An electronic filing system is a combination of the computer hardware, its op-
erating system, and software. It maintains a list of all files and their location. Un-
derstanding your electronic filing system will help in managing files.
• saved on your local hard drive, a network drive, or other media;
• shared through e-mail attachments;
• placed on the Web server for your office Web site.
FILE
In most ways, an electronic filing system works much like a paper filing system.
Put simply, in an electronic filing system you have cabinets that contain file fold-
ers that contain files, also called documents. In an electronic filing system, a file is
any document, such as a spreadsheet, database, report, picture, or presentation. In
other words, a file is any document created on the computer or received from an-
other computer. Every file has a file name and a three-letter extension, assigned by
the Windows system, which associates with a specific program. For example, a
Microsoft® Office Word file extension is .docx (version 2007). If procedures have
not been established for naming your electronic files, here are a few suggestions
for naming files that are created multiple times, such as letters to the same indi-
vidual, quarterly budgets, or monthly reports.
• Distinguish correspondence by including name, document type, and date.
Tunnell Margie 03020x Ltr identifies a letter written to Margie Tunnell on
March 2, 200x.
• Identify quarterly budgets by including the quarter number, year, and the label
of budget. For example, Qtr2 200x Budget represents the file created for the
second quarter 200x budget.
• Identify reports by using a subject, such as Proj10987-03280x for a project sta-
tus report dated March 28, 200x.
If you are consistent in naming your files, retrieval will be much more efficient.
You won’t have to say to anyone, “I know it’s here somewhere. Just give me a
minute to find it.”
344

Records Management
FOLDER
A directory in an electronic system contains files. You can create as many folders
and subfolders as you need; however, be mindful of the number or layers of sub-
folders. Folders organize the files in a logical manner, like using manila folders in-
side hanging folders to organize paper documents in a file cabinet drawer. For
example, a human resources department may designate a folder as Payroll and cre-
ate a subfolder as Payroll Timesheets.
A good place to create your folders and files is in the My Documents folder on
your local hard drive for easy retrieval.
DRIVE
The drive is the physical location where folders and files can be found. A drive
name consists of a single letter and a colon. For example, Drive C is identified as
the hard drive.
Drive D through Z are designated as optional drives, such as a network drive
or CD-ROM or removable drive (for a flash drive).
MANAGING FILES AND FOLDERS
You can manage your files and folders by using either Windows Explorer (not to
be confused with Internet Explorer) in Microsoft® Windows XP or Vista’s Orga-
nize feature, located under Computer. These features allow you to view and man-
age your files, folders, and drives. From Windows Explorer in Windows XP or
Organize in Vista, you can display contents and copy, move, delete, and find files.
ORGANIZING FILES
Use the following tips to help you organize the documents stored in your computer
and minimize the time you spend on retrieval.
• Use the Documents folder.Take advantage of this feature because the Documents
folder provides an easy way for you to store your documents. For example, you
can find files in many places, such as through Start, and Windows Explorer
(Windows XP) or Organize under Computer (Vista).
• Organize your directories and subdirectories logically.
As in paper filing, the key to efficient electronic filing is in the logical organi-
zation of the folders. For example, suppose you were asked to create a new elec-
tronic filing system for the training department. Look at your real (paper) file
cabinet. Do you have a section for specific training areas? A section for training
requests? A section for budgets? Your search of your regular file cabinet reveals a

general folder labeled Training Classes/200X and subfolders labeled Microsoft®
Access I, Microsoft Access II, and so on. To match your paper filing system, create
an electronic general folder with the same name and the same subfolders to match
your paper filing organization.
Whatever major categories you include in your regular paper filing system, in-
clude them on your computer and organize them in the same manner. Doing so
will enable you to move back and forth from paper to computer files with a min-
imum of effort.
• Determine the sequence of your files. For example, if one of your files or fold-
ers includes customer correspondence, you might use an alphabetical sequence.
For example, you might create a general folder labeled Correspondence and cre-
ate subfolders for groups of the alphabet. In each subfolder, you can create an-
other level of folders for each customer’s name. On the other hand, if you
reference your customer correspondence by account number, you might use a
numerical sequence.
• Keep file names short. Even though Windows allows you to use long file names,
long names produce cluttered displays. Be clear and brief.
• Maintain naming consistency with your paper files. The names of your elec-
tronic files should be exactly the same as your paper files. Doing so will allow
you to move back and forth between the two systems effortlessly.
• Create specialized folders for specific files. If you download information for re-
ports, articles, or pictures for presentations for use later on, create a folder la-
beled Download-Articles or Download-Reports.
• Perform regular maintenance. As in your paper filing system, on some periodic
basis, delete or archive files you no longer need. If you have saved paper copies of
correspondence, you can delete the electronic files. If your files are saved to your
company’s network, your files are backed up or saved periodically, usually every
evening. However, if your files are saved to your computer’s hard drive, you will
need to perform a backup or copy of these files on a regular basis. For example,
each Friday, you may back up or save copies of your files to an external storage
device, which is discussed later in this chapter. On the other hand, if important
files are saved to a hard drive and not to the company’s server, some office pro-
fessionals back up these important files at the end of the day. The guiding princi-
ple here is to back up your files to prevent any loss or damage of important
information that serve as evidence of decisions or transactions that have occurred.
• Screen print a list of your electronic filing system, paste it into a document, and
print it. Just as you have a list of your paper filing system, develop one for your
computer files. If your computer system were to crash, at least you would have
a handy reference of the items in your electronic filing system.

SAVING FILES
Although your computer’s internal hard drive is a type of storage medium (the
physical material on which data, instructions, and information is saved), you have
several choices for saving files you create or change on a computer. Other storage
media include the following:
Compact Disks (CDs)
Capacity is limited to about 700 megabytes. Depending on the recording device,
data saved on them may be “ready-only,” which means the files can’t be changed
and resaved on the same disk.
CD-RWs
A CD-RW (or compact disk-rewritable) is an erasable disk you can write or record
over multiple times. However, reliability of the CD-RW is reduced with each suc-
cessive rewrite.Writing on the CD-RW requires CD-RW software and drive. If you
do not know whether you have a CD-RW drive, check with your company’s com-
puter technician.
DVDs (Digital Video Disks) use technology much like CDs. However, they
hold more than six times as much data as CDs. Its main uses are video and data
storage. Files stored on DVDs will be readable for more than fifty years.
Flash Drives (sometimes called jump drives)
A flash drive provides portable storage memory that plugs into your computer.
You may prefer to use a flash drive to save your files, especially if files are being
transported from one location to another.
External Hard Drives
External hard drives are larger storage devices that you plug into your computer.
Like flash drives, they come in various amounts of storage capacity.
Your office will likely have procedures for how you should save and store your files.
It is important you follow these procedures carefully so that valuable data won’t be lost.
Retaining and Transferring Paper Records
If your organization has a records professional, he or she will be responsible for
handling records retention and transfer (or discard). Decisions about retention and
transfer are based on a number of factors, including the knowledge that someone
must have about the operation of the organization, state and federal laws relating
to business functions, cost of keeping records versus the cost of not keeping them,
and availability of off-site storage.
Because an entry-level administrative assistant or office assistant is rarely
called upon to handle this complex area, the following information is provided to
help you understand the importance and impact of retention and transfer in
records management.

Records Management
PAPER RECORDS RETENTION
Which documents should be retained? How long should I keep them? These deci-
sions cannot be made at random. If there is no retention schedule developed for
your organization, seek advice from a records consultant or visit ARMA’s Web site
for guidelines to follow. Here is an example of areas to consider:
• Retain two years, files such as inventory records.
• Retain three years, files such as petty cash vouchers.
• Retain eight years, files such as expense reports and expired contracts and leases.
• Retain indefinitely, files such as correspondence on legal and tax matters and
annual reports.
Before putting any guidelines into practice, get legal advice about time limita-
tion statutes in your state. Each state has its own statute of limitations, specifying
the time after which a record cannot be used as evidence in the courts. Among the
records affected by state statutes of limitations are written contracts, open ac-
counts, injury claims, and accident reports. Determining which records to keep
and for how long is a critical function.
Some records must be kept permanently; many records are kept from three to
twenty years; others are useful for only a short period and are kept for a year or less;
some records are disposed of without being stored. Records that are kept for a year or
longer are usually transferred from the active files to a storage area.The records man-
ager prepares a retention schedule, which indicates the length of time a record must be
kept, the type of storage media, and the schedule for final disposition of records.
If there is no formalized records management in your company, you will have to
pay particular attention to your own paper and electronic files. In your position, you
will create a lot of documents and handle a lot of paper, but not all documents you
create or handle will be identified as records. Review the section“Files Management”
in this chapter for common examples of documents that do not need to be kept.
Whether the documents are official records or not, you need to be diligent
about how long you will retain the information you manage. Over the next week
or month, become more aware of the length of time you will retain the documents
you either handle or create. If you retrieve a file you have not used in several
months or over a year, consider if it is important to keep and how long it should be
kept. Suppose you believe the document should be deleted. Before you delete any
document of importance, be certain to obtain authorization from your supervisor.
PAPER RECORDS TRANSFER
The most accessible file space should be used for active files; this means the less
active papers must be moved from time to time to free up the most accessible space
for the current files. Organizations use two methods of transfer: perpetual and pe-
riodic. Paper storage consumes much more space than electronic storage media.
However, the concept of perpetual and periodic transfer is applied to both paper
and electronic documents. Paper files may be transferred to a back room, off-site,
or processed on microfilm, which reduces files to less than 2 percent of the space
they now occupy in paper form.
Perpetual Transfer
The perpetual transfer method provides for continually transferring files to inac-
tive storage as a project or case is completed. It is highly applicable for records in
348

Records Management
construction companies, attorneys’ offices, and any organization that handles
projects or cases. All the records for one project or case are transferred at the time
it is completed.
Periodic Transfer
The periodic transfer method provides for transferring files to inactive storage at
predetermined intervals such as six months, one year, or eighteen months. The in-
active paper files are transferred to the storage center, leaving more space to house
the active documents, or a company may convert its paper records into an elec-
tronic image. The computer files may be moved into a folder labeled with Archive
and the quarter and year, such as Archive Qtr1-200X, or, the files may be moved
to one of the electronic storage mediums mentioned in the previous section.
Electronic Records Retention
Like paper records, inactive electronic records are transferred into storage. This
process is called archiving and usually involves moving records from the computer
system onto CDs or your organization’s server. Both the perpetual and periodic
transfer methods apply to electronic files.
Records managers are expected to retain and protect electronic records in the
same way they do paper records. Your organization and government policy af-
fecting electronic records also stipulates that records must be easily converted into
a readable format. This means that if you change your software application, you
must ensure that related documents less than specified years can still be quickly ac-
cessed and clearly read. With the rapid upgrades in technology, it is a challenge to
ensure that yesterday’s technology and software are kept available and in operat-
ing condition in the event you are expected to produce readable documents com-
patible to the old system.

International Standards 
for Records Management
Standards create a professional environment of “best practice” procedures.
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a global network
that identifies what international standards are required by businesses and gov-
ernment; develops them in partnership with the sectors that will put them to use;
adopts them by procedures based on national input; and delivers them to be im-
plemented worldwide.
The ISO is recognized worldwide as establishing the baseline for excellence in
records management programs. The ISO states that records management includes
• setting policies and standards;
• assigning responsibilities and authorities;
• establishing and sharing procedures and guidelines;
• providing a range of services relating to the management and use of records;
• designing, implementing, and administering specialized systems for managing
records;
• integrating records management into business systems and processes.
More information on the ISO can be found at its Web site, www.iso.org.
PAPER PREFERENCE
For years we have been told that offices would become paperless. It’s as if the pa-
perless office has become our professional destiny, our professional duty. But only
in some office tasks are we seeing less use of paper, whereas in others we are see-
ing a greater use of paper.
areas, and disposal of sensitive information in regular garbage without being shred-
ded or otherwise made inaccessible are issues that have made headline news.
Employers are expected to be aware of various laws and principles that pro-
mote the rights of their employees and customers.The person responsible for man-
aging the company’s records must be knowledgeable of laws pertaining to the
confidentiality and security of employee and customer records. Some of the ethi-
cal issues related to records management are
• confidentiality of personal information;
• security of physical equipment such as desktop and laptop computers as well as
paper file cabinets and portable storage media such as flash drives;
• validity of information;
• disposal of records;
• improper use of personal identification numbers (PINs) that intentionally or un-
intentionally allows unauthorized persons (other employees, Internet users, or
Internet hackers) access to confidential or personal Information.
As an office professional, you should be aware customer and employee records
and e-mails and other correspondence are often used as legal documents and that
legal actions may be taken if records are not handled in a safe and secure manner.
350

We use less paper when we
• use electronic calendars;
• send attachments on e-mail;
• leave voice mail messages;
• take notes on a keyboard;
• store files electronically.
But some offices are becoming more paper dependent.You see this when people
• insist on working from hard copies of records;
• don’t trust the electronic system and want records backed up on paper;
• print their e-mail messages and place them into paper files.
With the proliferation of communication, offices that like to print their docu-
ments have more to print than ever before, so it’s unlikely that paper suppliers and
photocopier vendors have much to fear in the near future.
Records Management
Quick Tips
To improve the overall management of paper and electronic
records, consider the following:
• Assessing the existing records;
• Focus on increasing efficiency, improving effectiveness and
functionality, protecting confidentiality and security, and
reducing the risk of loss and damage.
• Recruit the assistance from a record and management
consultant who can provide an analysis of your organization's
paper and electronic record system.

Records Management
Concept Review and Reinforcement
Review of Key Concepts
OUTCOME
CONCEPT
1. Discuss how records
management works as a
system.
How an organization treats its information will directly affect its ability to
compete, operate efficiently, comply with government regulations, and recover
from disaster. Applied as a system, an organization can approach control of its
recorded information from creation, through use and maintenance, and utlimately
to disposition of records.
2. Define the categories of
records.
•
Vital records are essential to operations or to continuation or resumption of
operations; re-creation of legal or financial status of organization; or fulfillment
of its obligations to stockholders and employees in the event of a disaster.
•
Important records are meaningful to business operation but must be limited as
to length of time they are retained.
•
Useful records are documents needed to conduct daily business operations.
•
Nonessential records are not needed beyond their current use and should be
discarded after their use.
3. Distinguish among the
filing systems.
•
Alphabetic filing identifies records using the A–Z sequence.
•
Numeric filing uses logical numerical order, such as terminal-digit filing and
decimal-numeric filing.
•
Geographic filing uses locations and A–Z sequence within locations.
•
Subject filing allows records to be filed alphabetically according to topics.
4. Describe filing supplies
and equipment needed.
•
Filing supplies include folders, guides, and labels.
•
Filing equipment includes vertical drawer cabinets, lateral cabinets, open
shelves, and mobile aisle systems.

personal, business
names, and
governmental and
political designations.
•
Specific filing rules for personal names include names of individuals, personal
names with prefixes, titles and suffixes, hyphenated names, pseudonyms and
royal or religions titles, non-English names, and nicknames.
•
Specific filing rules for business and organizational names include geographic
names, compass names, numeric names, and symbols used in business names.
•
Specific filing rules for governmental and political designations include federal
government, state and local governments, and non-U.S. governments.
6. Explain the steps in
preparing paper records
for filing.
The steps include
•
examining;

7. Discuss methods for
tracking paper files.
Charge-out methods include
•
guides with printed lines for writing description of materials removed, name of
person who has taken file, and date issued;
•
guides with slots or pockets to hold cards on which the charge-out information
is written.
8. List tips for organizing
electronic files.
•
Use My Documents folder to store and retrieve documents.
•
Organize directories and subdirectories logically.
•
Determine filing system or sequence of files.
•
Keep file names short.
•
Maintain naming consistency with paper files.
•
Be selective about files you keep.
•

9. Describe the guidelines
for records retention and
transfer.
Either use a consultant or visit ARMA’s Web site for guidelines to follow. Before
putting any guidelines in place, consult your organization’s legal department. For
retention, consider categories such as inventory records (retain two years), petty
cash vouchers (retain three years), and expense reports (retain for eight years). For
transferring files, consider perpetual and periodic methods.
10. Describe ethical issues
regarding records.
Some issues related to ethical principles of records management are

easy task, cut the paper into individual slips. Separate the
slips into groups, for example, A through D, and so on.
Alphabetize the slips. Count the slips to be certain you
have a total of thirty-five slips.
Complete the Answer Sheet for 8-B by indicating the
card number shown in parentheses before the name. Do
not include the parentheses in your answer. For instance,
indicate card number 1 under L on the answer sheet. If you
have more than one name in a group, list the card number
in alphabetical sequence. For example, under L, card num-
ber 1 would be listed prior to card number 12. To see an
example, review the answer sheet and look under L.
You will need to use the slips in the next assignment,
so keep them organized and in a safe place. Use a rubber
band or a paper clip to keep the slips together or place them
in an envelope to keep them in correct sequence. After you
have entered the card numbers, count the entries. You
should have a total of thirty-five. Submit your answer sheet
to your instructor. Before proceeding to the next applica-
tion, check with your instructor to see that you are ready.

Banking and Accounting Procedures
H
andling basic banking and accounting procedures is one of the more typical
duties of the office professional who works for a private company or for a
small professional office such as a doctor’s or dentist’s office. This part of the
job includes handling petty cash funds, banking transactions, payments received,
bank deposits and checks, and preparing bank reconciliations. In larger companies
there is usually a department designed for the purpose of handling the financial and
accounting procedures. Depending on the nature of the business, this department
may be called the Finance, Business Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable
Department, or simply the Administration Department. All incoming cash and
checks are forwarded to that department. After all invoices and statements are
approved for payment, they are forwarded to the same department for payment.
Regardless of the size of the office, you need to become familiar with some of
the basic banking transactions and accounting tasks you may need to perform.
This chapter will introduce traditional banking and record-keeping functions
essential to the office professional.
Banking Procedures
You may be called upon to handle banking procedures if you work in a small of-
fice or if your manager travels abroad. You should, therefore, become familiar
with all types of banking procedures.
TRADITIONAL BANKING PROCEDURES
A depositor establishes a checking account at a bank as a convenient means to
transfer funds. The instrument most used for transferring funds is the ordinary
check, which is defined as a written order of a depositor upon a commercial bank
to pay to the order of a designated party or to a bearer a specified sum of money
on demand (Figure 1).

Banking and Accounting Procedures
The parties to a check are the maker or drawer, the person who makes or
writes the check on his or her bank account; the drawee is the bank upon which
the check is drawn; and the payee, the person to whom the check is written.
If you are to sign checks for your manager, the organization where you work,
or both, you will be asked to complete a signature card, placing your authorized
signature on file in addition to your manager’s signature with the bank.
In addition to the ordinary check, the following are used to transfer funds:
cashier’s check, bank draft, bank money order, and traveler’s check.
Cashier’s Check
A cashier’s check, also called a treasurer’s check or official check, is written by an
authorized officer of the bank on its own funds. As a result, the drawer’s bank
guarantees payment to the payee. A depositor may obtain a cashier’s check by
writing a check on his or her own funds for the amount plus a fee.
In order for the cashier’s check to stand as proof of payment, the officer of the
bank gives a copy of the check to the person making the payment. The purchaser’s
name is on the official check. Cashier’s checks are suitable for times when a check
is not acceptable, such as when it is necessary to guarantee that a certain amount
of funds for payment are available. The check may be made payable to whomever
you designate and can be for any amount.
Bank Draft
A bank draft is a check drawn by a bank on its own funds (or credit) in another
bank located either in the same city or another city. The draft is made payable to
a third party, which, upon endorsing it, may cash the bank draft at the bank on
which it is drawn.
A bank draft can be used to transfer money to another person or organization
in another geographical location within the United States or abroad. A bank draft
payable in foreign currency may also be purchased.
To obtain a bank draft, an office professional should present to the bank his
or her manager’s or organization’s check made payable to the bank for the desired
amount plus the fee. In exchange, the office professional will receive a bank draft
made payable to the person or organization specified.
Bank Money Order
A bank money order, similar to the postal money order, may be obtained from a
bank. Money orders are often used in place of personal checks for transactions
such as mail order purchases. Money orders are blank when issued and the pur-
chaser fills in the payee information.
A bank money order requires the endorsement of the payee to transfer the
funds. It may be cashed at any bank. The fee for obtaining a bank money order is
nominal. The amount for which a single money order may be written is limited,
but the number of money orders that may be issued to the same person to be sent
to one payee is not restricted.
Traveler’s Check
A traveler’s check (or cheque, to use the spelling favored by Britain, Canada, and
American Express) is a check that functions as cash but is protected against loss
or theft. When the checks are lost or stolen, the owner usually can obtain a refund
immediately by contacting a representative office of the company whose checks
365

Banking and Accounting Procedures
were purchased. The checks may be purchased at banks or from other sources,
such as credit unions. Automated teller machines (ATMs) have almost made it un-
necessary to carry large sums of cash or cash substitutes.You will learn more about
ATMs later in this chapter. However, traveler’s checks may still be the best option
in some instances. Consider these examples:
• Your manager is visiting another country for only a few hours (e.g., while wait-
ing to change planes). If he or she wants to purchase a snack, newspaper, or
magazine and the vendor doesn’t take credit cards, using a traveler’s check may
be his or her only recourse.
• Your manager might be low on cash and the ATM network is down. (This seems
to happen most often at night or on weekends.)
• Your manager’s ATM won’t accept his or her personal identification number
(PIN), or the machine lacks multilingual instructions and the manager can’t fig-
ure out how to get cash.
One source where you can purchase traveler’s checks is American Express.
American Express traveler’s checks can be purchased at a bank, or at American
Express offices throughout the world. American Express traveler’s checks are sold
in denominations of $20.00, $50.00, $100.00, $500.00, and $1,000.00 (U.S.).
They may also be purchased in foreign currencies. You may get them in U.S. cur-
rency, or choose from five other currencies: euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dol-
lar, pound sterling, and Japanese yen. The cost is usually 1.5 percent of face value.
There is no time limit on their validity. A traveler who plans an extended stay
abroad may find it economically advantageous to purchase some traveler’s checks
in the currency of that country. Your manager can use traveler’s checks in shops,
hotels, and restaurants without paying multiple commissions or high conversion
fees. Unused checks will have to be changed back into U.S. currency unless they
are saved for another trip.
The purchaser must obtain traveler’s checks in person because the purchaser
must sign each one in the presence of the agent from whom the checks are pur-
chased. American Express also has a two-party check. Only one person must sign
for the checks.A 2 percent fee is charged for two-party checks.The purchaser’s sig-
nature on each check is his or her identification and protection. The purchaser can
cash a traveler’s check at a hotel, bank, other places of business, or an American
Express office. In order to cash a traveler’s check, the purchaser must sign the
check in the presence of the person accepting it.
Traveler’s checks are numbered serially. You should prepare a list of the serial
numbers of the checks in duplicate, one for your files and the other for your man-
ager to carry, preferably in a place separate from the traveler’s checks. Should trav-
eler’s checks become lost or stolen, the manager would contact the nearest
representative office of the bank or company from which they were purchased and

366

provide them with a list of the serial numbers of the missing checks and the total
amount of the checks. The issuer promises to replace them when lost or stolen
within twenty-four hours unless the purchaser has been negligent.
Electronic Funds Transfer
Electronic funds transfer (EFT) is an electronic delivery system for financial trans-
actions. With the use of computers, financial institutions can perform numerous
banking transactions without the use of checks. Advantages include no lost or
stolen checks and payments made quickly and on time.
Funds may be transferred electronically or by check, but both small companies
and larger corporations alike are moving toward using electronic funds transfer as
an efficient and cost-effective method of moving money between accounts elec-
tronically. As an office professional, you will probably not be required to set up
electronic funds transfer; however, you should know about each type and under-
stand how they work.You may already be familiar with some of the way funds are
transferred for personal use. You could be required to keep records for your man-
ager related to some of the electronic funds transfer areas or even obtain cash for
travel funds for the manager.
The major EFT services are ATMs, automated clearinghouses (centers for elec-
tronic funds transfer between financial institutions and individuals), and payment
by telephone.
Automated Teller Machines
Automated teller machines (ATMs) enable customers to obtain cash, make de-
posits, check the status of their accounts, transfer money between accounts, and
pay bills. A simplified version of the ATM is the cash machine, which only enables
customers to check the balance of their accounts and obtain cash. Cash machines
are often located in shopping malls, supermarkets, and gas stations to provide in-
stant access to cash. A customer activates an automated teller machine by using an
EFT (usually referred to as a debit card) card and enters a personal identification
number (PIN) (a secret number the depositor uses to access his or her account).
When an ATM is used at the bank, or a branch of that bank, where the bank
account is located, there is usually no fee charged; however, most other ATMs
charge fees that can become quite expensive.
Debit cards are used in the place of checks. Debit cards are obtained through
the bank by completing a credit application for a debit card through companies
such as Visa® or MasterCard®. Once the application is approved, the bank issues
the debit card, which can be used either as a debit card or a credit card. When used
as a credit card, the merchant requires a signature. When used as a debit card, a
PIN must be entered. No matter which way you use the card, the money  is
deducted from the bank account immediately. One drawback is if the card is lost
or stolen, it can still be used as a credit card with no PIN required and money au-
tomatically withdrawn. You can ask your bank to replace your debit card with an
ATM-only card, which requires a PIN and offers more protection because funds
cannot be withdrawn from your account without using a PIN.
Direct Payroll Deposit
Direct payroll deposit enables an organization to pay its employees without writ-
ing checks. Instead, the organization furnishes the bank with electronic instruc-
tions for all payroll disbursements to employees. The bank credits the account of
Banking and Accounting Procedures
367

Banking and Accounting Procedures
each employee with his or her net pay and withdraws the amount from the account
of the employer making payment. The employee receives a statement, often pro-
duced by a third party, or online from his or her employer. The statement shows
the gross payment, the type and amount of deductions, and the net payment.
Automatic Deposits
Funds can be automatically deposited as well.The company making the automatic
deposit must be given the account’s American Banking Association (ABA) elec-
tronic routing number and the bank account number in which the money is to be
deposited. This routing number and bank account number is usually printed on
the bottom of all checks. An example of an automatic deposit is federal payments,
such as Social Security checks.
Automatic Debits
Automatic debits are preauthorized automated transfers of funds for a company
from one account to another within the same financial institution. For example, a
company might transfer funds from its general checking account to a special ac-
count for payroll. In the office, preauthorized payments may be useful for repay-
ing business loans or petty cash accounts.
Web Banking
Also called online banking. Most banks offer business banking, investing, and in-
surance services to their customers on the Internet. Web banking provides easy
management of banking transactions online wherever you have access to the In-
ternet. Primary functions of such services enable business customers to make elec-
tronic transfers between accounts and get real-time information on balances and
transactions. Accounts may be viewed and manipulated “on screen” just as you
might with more traditional methods of banking. Many banks also offer electronic
bill payment services. Access to your Web banking services will depend upon your
bank, your company’s unique identification, and password. A unique password
can be established for each authorized user of the business account. Commercial
banking services are comprehensive but varied in design.
Telephone Transfers
Some companies allow payments to be made by phone. Telephone transfers can be
made by calling the company to whom you wish to make payment, giving them the
nine-digit routing number of the bank on which payment is to be drafted, the bank
account number, a check number, and amount.The company will draft the amount
from the checking account and the bank will honor the check as a telephone trans-
fer of funds. Not all companies provide this service.The advantage is payment does
not have to be made until the exact due date and late charges can be avoided.
A disadvantage is there is usually a $15.00 or more charge for this service.

Banking and Accounting Procedures
BANK CHECKS
Businesses use various ways to prepare checks.
Checks may be prepared with a check-writing
machine, a computer and a printer, or a pen.
Some businesses use check-writing machines as
a safety measure against possible alteration
of checks. Others make use of commercially
available software for check writing such as
Intuit’s Quicken or Simply Accounting. To
safeguard against fraud, often two signatures
are required or at least one signature and an-
other person cashing and/or making deposits.
Stop-Payment Notification
At the request of the drawer, a bank will place
stop-payment notification on a check for a fee
at any time. Stopping payment is a safety mea-
sure that should be taken when a check has
been lost or stolen. This step may also be
taken when a check is written for an incorrect
amount, when certain conditions of an agreement have not been met, or for other
reasons.
Check Endorsement
Banks require check endorsement (signing) by the payee when a check is presented
for cash or deposit. The payee signs on the reverse side of the check—preferably at
the left end. A bank will accept checks for deposit that have been endorsed by a rep-
resentative of the payee. The endorsement may be made with a rubber stamp, or it
may be handwritten in ink.
Endorsements are of three types: blank, restrictive, and full (Figure 2).
Blank Endorsement. A blank endorsement consists of only the payee’s signature.
The payee should sign exactly as the payee’s name is carried on the bank account.
A check endorsed using a blank endorsement is payable to the bearer; therefore,
the holder should use a blank endorsement only when he or she is at the bank
depositing or cashing the check in case the check is lost or stolen.
Restrictive Endorsement. A restrictive endorsement limits the use of a check to the
purpose stated in the endorsement. Words such as For deposit only or Pay to the
order of are written before the organization’s name or the depositor’s signature.
As a result, further endorsement of the check is restricted. A restrictive endorse-
ment should be used when deposits are sent to the bank by mail.
Full Endorsement. A full endorsement, also called a two-party check, transfers a
check to a specified person or organization. Pay to the order of followed by the
name of the person or organization to which the check is being transferred is writ-
ten on the check preceding the signature of the endorser.
BANK DEPOSITS
Even though a company is using Web banking to take care of day-to-day trans-
fers between accounts and information on balances and transactions, businesses

still need to deposit money into their accounts. Many companies use e-commerce
applications, which accept electronic deposits from customers, but cash deposits
remain an administrative function of many retail-oriented and small businesses.
The administrative professional may have the task of making bank deposits. If
making cash deposits is one of your duties, make them regularly. In between times,
keep cash and checks in a secure place. When making a deposit, present coins, pa-
per currency (bills), checks, traveler’s checks, money orders, and bank drafts to the
bank teller for deposit, along with a deposit slip in duplicate listing what is being
deposited.
Preparing the Deposit
Use coin wrappers supplied by the bank to package a large number of coins in
rolls. Write the account name on the outside of each roll. The numbers of coins
that can be packaged in different rolls are shown in this table:
Number
Value
Coin
in Roll

50
$ 0.50
Nickels
40
$ 2.00
Dimes

$ 5.00
Quarters
40
$10.00
When preparing the currency for deposit, each denomination must be strapped by
a band, called a bill wrapper, which can be obtained from the bank or other
sources. Follow these rules:
• Separate your currency being deposited by denomination.
• Face all currency the same direction. (This means that the pictures of the presi-
dents should all be face up, with their head at the top.)
• If you have enough bills, your currency must be strapped by denomination.
When strapping currency, each strap must contain the same denomination—no
mixing bills.
Preparing the Deposit Slip
Keep on hand a supply of deposit slips, which may be obtained from the bank.The
deposit slips provided by the bank are multiple-copy sets encoded with the depos-
itor’s account number.
Write the current date, the name exactly as it appears in the account, and the
address. Add the account number if it is not already on the deposit slip. Some
370

Banking and Accounting Procedures
banks require a separate listing of coins and paper currency. See
the example deposit slip in Figure 3.
List each check by the drawer’s name or the drawee’s name.
Use whatever system works best for your record-keeping pur-
poses. Whichever you use, be consistent. List a money order as
“money order.” List a traveler’s check as “traveler’s check.”
Make sure the total shown on the deposit slip is correct. When
you cannot list all the checks on one deposit slip, either staple
two deposit slips together, or show on the deposit slip the total
of the checks being deposited and attach a separate list of the
checks. Present the checks to the bank teller in the order in
which you list them.
BANK STATEMENT RECONCILIATION
As an office professional, you should know basic information
about banking procedures. Although you will probably not have
to complete the bank reconciliation for the company unless you
work for a small company, you should know how to reconcile a
bank statement.
Each month the bank issues a current bank statement to the
depositor. The bank statement can be mailed to the company or if
the company uses Web banking, the account can be viewed from
the bank statements online. A comparison of the final bank bal-
ance on the bank statement with the company checkbook balance
is called bank reconciliation.
To balance with the bank statement’s figure, checks listed on the
bank’s statement are checked off in the check register.Some banks re-
turn checks that have been paid by the bank with the bank statement
each month, other banks return photo copies of each check, and still
other banks provide copies of checks upon request only. Figure 4
shows an example of a bank statement. Canceled checks have been
paid by the bank.The statement shows the previous month’s balance,
deposits made (credits), checks paid  (debits), bank charges (service
charges or ATM fees), and the ending balance.
If you are responsible for completing the bank reconciliation
with the company’s checkbook balance, complete it as soon as
you receive the bank statement. Compare the final balance on the
bank statement with the balance in the company checkbook and
then account for the difference. Usually the two balances do not agree for the fol-
lowing reasons:
• Checks have been written that have not been presented to the bank for payment.
• Deposits may have been made since the statement was sent.
• Automatic credits (deposits) and debits (withdrawals) have been made by the bank.
• Errors in recording checks or deposits may have been made.
Most bank statements have bank reconciliation forms printed on the back of
each page of the bank statement for the user’s convenience.
Begin by assembling the following:
1. The current bank statement and canceled checks.
2. The bank statement for the previous month.

Banking and Accounting Procedures
Accounting Procedures
Most organizations maintain computerized accounting records. Accounting is a
separate business function, performed by accountants, but record keeping occurs
wherever a record originates. Consequently, office professionals maintain and as-
sist with various financial records. Some office professionals, especially those who
work for owners of businesses, help the owners with personal business records.
You may also be responsible for a petty cash fund. In addition, you may be
asked to keep a record of office supplies on hand or to assist with payroll records.
PETTY CASH FUND
When the amount of office expenditure is small and payment should be made im-
mediately, it may be more convenient to pay cash rather than write a check.To pro-
vide cash to pay for incidental items, such as messenger service, postage due on a
package, or emergency purchases of office supplies, organizations establish a petty
cash fund. The fund can range from $10.00 to $100.00 or more, depending on the
cash needs for a certain period, usually a month. Even though the fund is used to
make miscellaneous payments, the petty cash must be accounted for.
Generally the office professional is responsible for
handling the petty cash fund. To keep track of petty
cash, observe the following standard procedures:
1. Keep the cash and completed vouchers in a box or
an envelope and put them in a safe place. They
should be in a locked desk drawer or file or in an of-
fice safe. Balance the petty cash record at least once
a week. If the cash and vouchers are left unlocked,
balance the record at the end of each day.
2. Prepare a petty cash voucher for each expenditure
you make. An example is shown in Figure 5. The
petty cash voucher, which is a receipt, should show
the amount paid, the voucher number, the date, to
whom the payment was made (received by), the
purpose of the payment, the expense category to
which the payment will be charged, and the signature 
3. Look for omissions of checks or deposits.
4. Check for a math error in the check stubs.
From the bank reconciliation, several journal entries must be made in the com-
pany’s general ledger.These entries along with the bank reconcialiation are usually
made by an accounting assistant or bookkeeper.After these entries have been made
and posted to the company books, the cash ledger account should be in balance
with the company checkbook as well.
Your part in a company related to the banking procedures is that you may
have to verify expenditures and keep invoices and receipts and submit them to the
accounting department.
The accounting department will file all canceled checks and bank reconcilia-
tions. The retention period for checks and the method of disposing of them will be
determined by your company’s policy.

or initials of the person authorizing payment. Some organizations also require
the signature or initials of the person receiving payment. Unless the account-
ing department stipulates the vouchers be machine printed, write them using
a pen; this way you complete the voucher quickly at the time you are making
the payment and without interrupting work you may have in the printer.
3. Keep an accurate petty cash record, using either a petty cash book or a distri-
bution sheet or envelope (see Figure 6). For each payment from the petty cash
funds, enter the date, the amount, the voucher number, and an explanation of
the petty cash record. The total of the expenditures plus the cash on hand
should equal the original amount of the petty cash fund.
Some petty cash books provide columns for distribution of payments by
expense categories; others do not. The columns and the appropriate headings
for the petty cash record can be printed on a sheet of paper or a manila enve-
lope. Accounting departments frequently supply manila envelopes imprinted
with the columns and headings for the petty cash record, including columns
for the distribution of payments. Posting the expenditures in the columns pro-
vided for each predetermined expense category simplifies preparing the sum-
mary of expenditures when you need to replenish the petty cash fund.
4. Replenish the petty cash fund soon enough to keep an adequate supply of cash
on hand. In some organizations, petty cash is replenished at a predetermined
time, for instance, when only one-fourth of the cash remains. In others,
replenishing the petty cash fund is left to the judgment of the person who is
responsible for maintaining the fund.
5. To replenish the petty cash fund, balance the petty cash record, formally
request a check for the amount needed to bring the fund amount back to its
beginning balance, and prepare the petty cash report. Follow these steps:
Steps to Replenish Petty Cash
Refer to Figure 6 as you read these steps:
1. Count the cash on hand. In the example, you should have $11.76, which
is the difference between the amount in the petty cash fund, $50.00, and
the amount paid out, $38.24.
2. Total each Distribution column and the Total column of the petty cash
envelope.
3. Subtract the total amount paid out ($38.24) from the amount of petty cash
($50.00). The difference should agree with the cash count left in the enve-
lope ($11.76).
4. Total the amount of all the vouchers to see they agree with the Total col-
umn ($38.24).
5. Add the totals across the bottom under the Distribution columns to see the
sum is equal to the amount shown in the Total column.
6. Write a check or request the amount paid (Total column $38.24) to bring
the petty cash fund back to its original amount ($50.00).
6. Submit the records called for by the accounting department. When the account-
ing department supplies a petty cash distribution envelope, the usual procedure
is to submit the envelope with the supporting vouchers enclosed. Before you
release an envelope, copy the record for your files. If you keep a petty cash book,
submit a petty cash report similar to the one shown in Figure 7.Attach the petty
cash vouchers.

PAYROLL
One of the common accounting procedures an office professional might be re-
quired to do is payroll, especially if he or she works for a small company (See
Figure 8 Payroll clerk working on weekly payroll). As with petty cash, a record
must be kept that summarizes the payroll for a particular period. This record is
called a payroll register.The payroll register summarizes for each employee the sta-
tus of wages earned, payroll deductions, and final take-home pay. The summary
377

can be done manually or by computer using a
payroll software program, but no matter
which method is used, all employers are re-
quired by law to create and keep a payroll
record for each payroll period.
Payroll
records usually are prepared weekly, semi-
monthly, or monthly.
Figure 9 shows a typical payroll register.
Notice the register shows columns for
employee data (name, marital status, withhold-
ing allowances, hourly rate), regular hours
worked (first forty hours worked in the payroll
period), and the number of overtime hours
worked (any hours worked over forty hours).
Next, gross earnings (total regular earnings
plus overtime earnings) are calculated.
The deductions begin with the Federal In-
surance Contributions Act (FICA), also called
Social Security. Two taxes are required for all
employees: Social Security and Medicare. So-
cial Security, or the Old Age, Survivors, and
Disability Insurance (OASDI) requires that 6.2 percent be paid on the maximum
earnings (or wage base) on which increases each year. Federal health insurance (HI),
health insurance for older Americans commonly called Medicare, has no wage base
and all earnings are subject to the 1.45 percent set by law. Both of these rates are sub-
ject to change by legislation. The combined rate for Social Security and Medicare is
presently 7.65 percent. Deductions are amounts deducted from gross pay, such as So-
cial Security, Medicare, federal income tax, group medical insurance, dental
insurance, union dues, savings bonds, and charitable contributions, as well as federal
income tax and FICA. State income taxes must be deducted in some states as well.
Follow these steps to complete a payroll register:
1. Enter each employee’s name, marital status (single, married, or head-of-
household), number of withholding allowances (the number of exemption 
allowances claimed on his or her W-4 form), the hourly rate (amount earned per
hour), the number of regular hours worked, and the number of overtime hours
(any hours worked over the first forty hours per pay period) worked.
2. Calculate regular earnings (first forty hours earned in a pay period) by multi-
plying the hourly rate by the regular hours worked.
3. Calculate overtime earnings by multiplying the hourly rate by the overtime
hours worked by 1.5 (time and a half).
4. Add regular earnings and overtime earnings to obtain gross earnings (total
regular earnings plue overtime earnings).
5. Multiply gross earnings by 6.2 percent to calculate OASDI.
6. Multiply gross earnings by 1.45 percent to calculate HI.
7. The amount of federal income tax (money withheld from a paycheck and paid
to the federal government as a tax on wages earned) withheld is obtained from
(Circular E) Employer’s Tax Guide federal income tax table booklet.The book-
let gives instructions and tables for weekly,biweekly,semimonthly,and monthly
payrolls, each showing amounts to be withheld for single, married, or head-
of-household deductions for federal income tax. These rates change annually.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Most office professionals will not be required to have an extensive knowledge of
accounting procedures, but you should be familiar with the two following major
financial statements: the income statement and the balance sheet.
An owner or manager of a business must determine the condition of the busi-
ness he or she owns or manages. Financial reports such as an income statement or
a balance sheet, when compared with prior years or with industry averages, can
show the owner or manager whether the business is healthy. Reading or inter-
preting financial statements can tell the owner or manager if a problem exists, to
what degree the problem has advanced, and what strengths or weaknesses the
company has. As an office professional, you should understand the purpose of the
income statement and the balance sheet
and recognize what accounting informa-
tion goes on each (Figure 10).
Income Statement
An income statement is also referred to as
a profit and loss (P & L) statement or op-
erating statement. The income statement
shows the results of company operations
in terms of money earned (revenue) and
expenses incurred. Figure 11 shows an in-
come statement.
The income statement covers the re-
sults of company operations for a certain
period. In Figure 11, you will notice the
period is for one year. The first part of the
income statement summarizes the total
amount of sales (revenue) and the cost
of the merchandise sold. The difference
between the two is called gross profit on
sales. The gross profit is not the profit the

owner can take for personal use because the company has incurred many
expenses (the cost of operation) that will reduce revenue to a truer picture of what
the company made. The income reported after expenses is also not the final in-
come figure. Income tax must be accounted for (estimated and deducted) to ar-
rive at the final income figure for the company.
Balance Sheet
The balance sheet summarizes the balances of the assets (what the business owns
whether paid for or not), liabilities (what the business owes), and the owner’s equity
(what the business is worth). The balance sheet reports what a company is worth
on any one given day—usually reported at the end of the month or year. It shows
the company’s complete financial condition. As an office professional, you should
understand its various sections. Figure 12 shows a completed balance sheet.
The balance sheet is divided into three parts—assets, liabilities, and owner’s
equity. The assets are what the company owns and are shown as either current
assets or long-term assets. Current assets are those assets that can be sold or turned

into cash quickly or can be consumed in a short period. Plant and equipment, of-
ten referred to as fixed assets, are those assets with a long life that will be used over
many years in the operation of the company such as land and buildings.
Liabilities are the debts the company owes. Current liabilities are short-term debts—
usually debts that can be paid in one year. Long-term liabilities are debts due for long
periods of time—usually more than one year. Owner’s equity is the capital the owner
has invested in the company.
Even though you will probably not create income statements and balance
sheets, depending on the size of the company where you work, you may be asked
to work with them in some manner. Being familiar with these financial statements
will tell you more about your company and its stability.
BUDGETING
Budgeting is the process of planning future business operations and defining those
plans in a formal report. The report expressed in financial terms is called a budget.
Budgets may be developed for short periods, such as a month, or long periods, such
as a year. Annual budgets are often divided into shorter periods to better evaluate
a company’s ability to stay within the prescribed budget. Budgetary control is cru-
cial to the successful operation of a business, and as an employee you will be asked
to participate in the budget process in some way. You might be asked to serve on
the budget committee (see Figure 13) that
reviews and revises various estimates of
income and expenses by other employees.
Usually budgeting procedures begin at the
department level and move upward, with
each area of responsibility combining fig-
ures submitted from below them and
passing them upward in the company.
The ultimate result is the master budget.
The master budget consists of various
budgets that collectively express the com-
pany’s future activities.
Anytime you or your department
wants new equipment, additional person-
nel, or anything that comes down to cost-
ing the company money, you must justify
how that spending will benefit the com-
pany in some way. It might mean in-
creased productivity or even financial
savings if approved. Unless you can paint
a clear picture that shows these benefits,

however, you are not likely to have your requests approved. When it comes to set-
ting budget figures, everyone is asking for money. The request that most clearly
shows justification usually gets approved if the money is available.
What if your office really needs an additional part-time person to get all the
work done? How would you go about justifying money being spent from next
year’s budget when you have been asked to cut your budget by 5 percent? You
would begin by determining how cost effective that part-time person will be. Study
the following scenario:
One Full-Time Office Professional
Salary and benefits
$34,000
Office supplies used
2,500
Telephone line
500
Depreciation expense
2,700
Total annual cost
$39,700
$39,000 divided by 2,080 hours (52 weeks × 40 hours per week 
2,080 hours) worked per year  $19 per hour cost (rounded)
Amount of hours worked overtime last year  824 × $28.50 rate 
$23,484 (1.5 × 19.00  28.50)
One Part-Time Office Professional 
(from Manpower or Kelly Services, for example)
Salary (no benefits) 1,040 hours @ $14/hour
$14,560
Office supplies (1/2 of full time)
1,250
Telephone (shared with another)
0
Depreciation expense (1/2 of full time)
1,350
Total annual cost
$17,160
Savings ($23,484 – 17,160)
$ 6,324
Management could quickly see that by employing a part-time office profes-
sional, $6,324 could be saved.
Budget Reports
A budget report provides the basis for analyzing and revising spending activities
of a company by comparing actual sales or costs with the figures that were bud-
geted for those sales or costs. Every business has a budget. It may be in paper for-
mat for the company or in the owner’s head, but for a budget to be effective it must
be analyzed and adjusted on an ongoing basis. That is where the budget report is
important. Some budget reports are completed weekly, others monthly, and per-
haps even quarterly. The important point is the budget is periodically reviewed to
find how realistic the budget is and how closely it is being followed.
After the accounting department closes the books for the month, it will send a
budget report to each department. Study the example given in Figure 14. Pay
particular attention to the callouts that identify how to read the report. The office
professional will probably be the first to receive the budget report. His or her man-
ager expects the budget to be followed. That means not overspending and not go-
ing over the budgeted amount. In the example for Supreme Appliances it shows
the budgeted amount for office supplies for the year. Just like your personal
budget, spending must be watched carefully so money will be available to purchase

supplies for the entire year. Talk with your manager on the procedure you are to
follow concerning the budget. Be certain you are clear on how much authority you
are given when making purchases for the department and when and if you have to
have approval before placing an order.
OFFICE SUPPLIES INVENTORY
Office professionals should replenish their office supplies during the time of day
or week when they are least busy. Yet they need to plan so they are not searching
for supplies when they are pressed for time to complete a rush job. Sometimes an
office professional is responsible for stocking office supplies for an entire floor or
a department. To manage this, you need a record of supplies on hand.
An easy way to determine supplies needed is to keep an inventory of each item.
You can do this on your computer, using a spreadsheet program or on a 4 by 
6-inch card to create a perpetual inventory record. When you check supplies out
of the main supply department or order them directly, enter the amount of each
item received and then add the amount to the figure in the balance column. When
you take supplies from the supply cabinet or shelf, enter the amount in the
checked-out column and then subtract the amount to show the new balance.
Encourage others who check out supplies to follow the same procedure.
By looking at the perpetual inventory record, you can decide (1) whether or
not the item you need is on hand in sufficient quantity and (2) when it is time to
check out or order additional supplies.
In most companies, a request for supplies would begin with a purchase requi-
sition that indicates the supplies needed and the amount to be ordered. Combin-
ing all requests for supplies from all departments is cost effective. The purchase
requisition is used to generate a purchase order, which is sent to the supplier. The
supplier fills the order and sends your company an invoice. A bill of lading, listing
the goods shipped to you, will accompany the shipment. When the supplies are de-
livered, the goods received are checked against the purchase order. If all informa-
tion is correct and all supplies received agree with what was ordered, authorization
to pay the invoice is made.
Often when several supply orders are made, the invoices will be held until a
statement is sent at the end of the month.You may pay all or a portion of the amount
due depending on the business arrangement with the company. Figure 15 shows the
forms cycle. In large companies, a computer generates these forms. Using your com-
puter, you would retrieve the purchase order file and enter the request for office sup-
plies. This information could be saved and sent by e-mail to the purchasing
department that would process the order.
Electronic procurement of supplies is improving the way businesses buy from
and partner with suppliers. Instead of wading through purchase orders and pur-
chase requisitions that may take days or weeks to process, some employees go

right to their computers and use a Web-based procurement system to summon a
virtual shopping cart and order items they need right away over the Internet.These
Web-based systems have actually changed employees into strategic buyers by
granting them control over a subset of preapproved and budgeted items. They
do not have to ask permission to order something. Based on the amount of pur-
chasing power the company grants them, they can order at will and be alerted if
their purchase is not allowed or if they’ve reached their spending limit. The only
constraint is they must use approved vendors.
ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT
The office professional must be familiar with the accounting department. Your
company may have a cost center in the accounting department that handles cost
control for the company. You must learn the following:
• for which budget account titles and numbers the manager is responsible;
• which accounts are used most often;
• how the accounts may be used;
• what procedures to follow when placing orders or making purchases;
• how to charge certain expenses and what expenses are allowable;
• which department code to use.

Banking and Accounting Procedures
Ethics in Accounting Procedures
You probably have read or seen on television news about the financial collapse of
many businesses that were ranked among the most admired companies in Amer-
ica. These companies were thought to be among the most stable, profit-making
companies in the business world. What went wrong? The inevitable question is
where were the auditors and the accountants as these financial statements of well-
being were released? The failure of these companies cost investors millions of dol-
lars. The problem appeared to be one of a lack of ethics, which shook our trust in
those involved in accounting practices. Ethics can be taught and learned. The As-
sociation of Certified Public Accountants has incorporated a requirement that to
maintain their license to practice, CPAs are required to have an ethics course once
every three years.
Because of the high cost of dishonesty, you must be a person others see as hav-
ing high values. You must be a person who would not compromise those values,
especially when working in any area that has to do with finances of the company.
Examples might be Payroll, Budget, Accounts Payable (paying company bills),
or Accounts Receivable (receiving money from customers) to name a few. High
ethical standards are required in every phase of the office professional’s job.
Remember you may not have the responsibility directly but your supervisor may
have some responsibility in one or all of these areas. You want both you and your
supervisor to be viewed as having high ethical standards.
Often a company hires an outside certified public accountant (CPA) to handle
the more complicated aspects of accounting for the company. A bookkeeper is often
hired to keep the company’s accounting records.The bookkeeper’s job involves jour-
nalizing (recording each transaction in a journal), calculating payroll and writing
checks, paying bills, ordering supplies, and many, many other duties. In a small com-
pany, the office professional may be assigned all or part of these tasks. If your job
includes bookkeeping, you should have training in this area. The job of an account-
ant is quite different. Although they know how to keep a set of books, accountants
rarely do so. Their job involves creating and interpreting financial statements,
advising about financial matters that affect decision making, auditing records,
and completing income tax reports. An accountant is required to have a bachelor’s
degree or higher.
You may find you must provide current accounting information for the CPA.
For instance, if you kept the budget information on a spreadsheet, you might be
asked to save a copy on disk and send the file to the CPA as an attachment to an
e-mail message. If you are using accounting software, such as QuickBooks, to
make your entries during the month, you might be asked to make a backup copy
of that software, which includes your entries for the period, and send it to the CPA
as an attachment to an e-mail message. The CPA would open the software and
make the necessary reports from your information, then alert you when you may
continue making entries into your software.
Every office professional will be involved in some way with the accounting
function in a company. Therefore, as a professional you should know the overall
accounting cycle and how it works within the company to efficiently handle the
responsibility assigned to your manager.

Banking and Accounting Procedures
International Currency Exchange
An office professional might find it necessary to provide his or her manager with
the current currency exchange rate available when the manager travels abroad.
You might also have to exchange money in the United States before the manager
leaves or exchange money back into U.S. dollars after the manager returns from a
trip abroad.
You can research the current exchange rate for any country’s currency in many
ways. For instance, you can quickly search on the Internet, call your local bank, or
check the newspaper. Or if your airport has international flights, you can usually
find a company at the airport that exchanges currency. Exchange rates are quoted
per $1 U.S. Once you know the rate, you can multiply the rate times the number
of dollars you want exchanged. For example, suppose the Japanese yen exchange
rate is 95.12720. To change $75 U.S. to yen, multiply 75 by 95.12720  7,135
(rounded) Japanese yen.
When exchanging foreign currency for U.S. dollars, most banks exchange only
currency and not coins. When your manager arrives at his or her foreign destina-
tion, exchanging currency is often one of the first things to be done. Even if it is a
small amount, he or she might need money for transportation to the hotel, tip
money, or money for meals. To avoid having to do this while traveling, you might
be asked to obtain the foreign currency prior to the manager’s trip.
Quick Tips
KEEP YOUR COMPUTER WORK AREA CLEAN AND YOUR COMPUTER SAFE!
Keeping your computer clean doesn’t take a lot of skill and
doesn’t need to cost a lot of money. In most cases, just taking a
few simple precautions, using common sense, and being ready
for the unexpected is all it takes.
Keep a Clean Work Area
• Don’t eat or drink over your keyboard. Crumbs and liquid can
damage the unit.
• Don’t stack items on top of a large monitor! This will prevent
the air vents from working properly.
• Never place magnetic items on your computer processing unit
(CPU, also called a tower). Magnets can erase data.
Keep Your Computer Safe
• Never share your password with others.
• Avoid fancy screensavers, emoticons, smileys, and so on. You
may be opening your computer to Adware (software that
installs on your hard drive and often causes pop-up ads to
appear periodically). You don’t need the aggravation.
• Add helpful browser toolbars from well-known companies
such as Google or Yahoo!. These browsers help you block 
pop-up screens as well.
• Stay alert to what is happening on your screen and don’t be
taken in by announcements that something is wrong with your
computer. All problems should be checked only by your
information systems department.
Remember,prevention is better (and cheaper) than the cure sometimes.

Concept Review and Reinforcement
Review of Key Concepts
OUTCOME
CONCEPT
1. Identify and explain the
use of a cashier’s check,
bank draft, bank money
order, and traveler’s
check.
•
A cashier’s check, also called a treasurer’s check or official check, is written by
an authorized officer of the bank on its own funds; it guarantees payment to
the payee by the drawer’s bank.
•
A bank draft can be used to transfer money to another person or organization
in another geographical location within the United States or abroad. A bank
draft payable in foreign currency may also be purchased.
•
A bank money order similar to a postal money order may be obtained from
a bank.
•
Traveler’s checks are used in place of cash with protection against loss or theft.
2. Identify the various
ways funds are
transferred
electronically.
•
Automated teller machines (ATMs), located at banks, in shopping malls, in
supermarkets, and in many other places, enable customers to obtain cash and
make deposits using a personal identification number (PIN).
•
Debit cards are used in the place of checks. Debit cards are obtained through
the bank by completing a credit application for a debit card through
companies such as Visa® or MasterCard®.
•
Automatic debits are preauthorized automated transfer of funds for an individual
or company from one account to another within the same financial institution.
•
Web banking provides easy management of banking transactions online
wherever you have access to the Internet.
•
Telephone transfers can be made by calling the company to whom you wish to
make payment and giving them the check number and amount so the
company can draft the amount from your checking account.
3. Explain how to make
stop-payment
notification and endorse
checks.
•
At the request of the drawer, a bank will place stop-payment notification on a
check for a fee at any time until it has cleared the bank upon which it is drawn.
•
Banks require check endorsement (signing) by the payee when a check is
presented for cash or deposit.
•
A blank endorsement is writing the signature on the back left of the check the
signature to whom the check is written.
•
A restrictive endorsement limits the use of a check to the purpose stated in the
endorsement such as “for deposit only.”
•
A full endorsement, also called a two-party check, transfers a check to a
specified person or organization.
4. Reconcile a bank
statement.
•
Reconciling a bank statement makes the checkbook balance agree with the
bank’s balance by adding to the bank statement any outstanding checks or
deposits in transit; by subtracting bank services charges, ATM fees, adding any
credits (interest or automatic deposits) and subtracting any debits (errors
made in the recording of checks) from the checkbook balance.
5. Describe what a petty
cash fund is and how it
is used.
When the amount of office expenditure is small and payment should be made im-
mediately, it may be more convenient to make the payment by cash rather than by
check. To provide cash to pay for incidental items, such as messenger service,
postage due on a package, or emergency purchases of office supplies, organiza-
tions establish a petty cash fund from $10.00 to $100.00 or more, depending on
the cash needs for a certain period, usually a month.

6. Calculate a weekly
payroll on a payroll
register.
•
Calculate gross earning by multiplying the hourly rate by 40 hours; then
calculate overtime amount by multiplying hours worked times hourly rate times
1.5 (time and one-half). Add overtime and regular time to total gross earnings.
•
Multiply gross earnings by 6.5 percent to calculate Social Security.
•
Multiply gross earnings by 1.45 percent to calculate Medicare.
•
Add all deductions.
•
Subtract deductions from gross pay to calculate net pay.
7. Explain the parts of an
income statement and
balance sheet.
•
The parts of an income statement are revenue and expense accounts.
•
The parts of a balance sheet are assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity accounts.
Assets must equal total liabilites and owner’s equity amounts.
8. Explain the budgeting
process.
Budgeting is the process of planning future business operations and defining those
plans in a formal report. The report expressed in financial terms is called a budget.
9. Keep an inventory of
supplies and order
supplies as needed.
Office professionals should replenish their office supplies during the time of day
or week when they are least busy. To manage supplies, you need a record of 
supplies on hand.
10. Discuss the importance
of demonstrating ethical
conduct in financial
matters.
Because of the high cost of dishonesty, as an office professional you must be a
person others see as having high values. You must be a person who would not
compromise those values, especially when working in the accounting area.
11. Demonstrate how to
change U.S. dollars to
foreign money using
currency exchange rates.
Research in the newspaper or online the exchange rate for the country to be vis-
ited. Multiply the exchange rate by U.S. $1. U.S. dollars can be exchanged at most
large airports that provide international flights.

Building Your Office Skills
Exploring the Workplace: Activities
1. Call two local banks, credit unions, or other finan-
cial institutions and obtain information about certi-
fied checks, official checks, bank drafts, money
orders, traveler’s checks, ATM charges, and the
availability and cost, if any, of online account access
and bill payment services. Write a comparison of
your findings at the two institutions.
2. If you have a job, ask if someone is in charge of the
petty cash fund at your workplace. Interview that
person and write a report on the procedures fol-
lowed. If you do not work, ask someone you know
who works to find out this information at his or her
company, or call local companies and ask to set up
an interview. Explain the purpose of your visit is to
gather information for a class project.
3. Interview an office professional and ask him or her
about the methods used for setting up a budget
each year. Identify the process in a step-by-step
approach—what does he or she do first, second,
third, and so on. Summarize your findings, including
the steps.
4. With your team member, locate exchange rates for
six countries. Create a table showing the country, the
current exchange rate, and the amount of foreign

1. Lost traveler’s checks. Your supervisor is out of town
and calls to tell you his briefcase was stolen from his
hotel room this afternoon. He had locked his
remaining traveler’s checks in the briefcase. He is
frantic and doesn’t know what to do.Analyze the sit-
uation and outline a plan of action for him, assum-
ing you have followed all the correct procedures
concerning traveler’s checks.
2. Petty cash fund.You are new on the job. Because you
keep the petty cash fund, Leah, a coworker, has come
to you and asked to borrow $10.00 until tomorrow.
Other employees have told you the manager does
not care if they borrow from petty cash. No one has
asked you until today. Analyze the situation and 
explain what you would do and why.

3. Payroll. You supervise the payroll department.
Several department heads have recently been late in
turning in time cards, and your employees have been
complaining they are rushed and believe being
rushed has caused them to make the careless errors
in employees’ paychecks that have been reported. It
is budget time, and you know your manager wants
the department heads to get their budget recommen-
dations in—they are under pressure to finish. Explain
how you will handle the situation.
4. Money missing from petty cash fund. You are
responsible for handling the petty cash fund in your
department. The money and petty cash receipts are
kept in a drawer that is locked,and both you and your
manager have keys to the drawer. When you attempt
to balance your receipts and cash remaining in the
drawer, you realize that $50.00 is missing from the
fund. After an employee borrowed from the fund on
Monday, you balanced the fund; it is now Thursday.
Analyze the situation and explain what you would do
and why.

Often problems can arise in an office concerning the
petty cash fund. When guidelines are established and
strictly followed, problems may be avoided.
Your Task
You have been responsible for keeping the
petty cash fund in Ms. Quevedo’s office. Written
guidelines have not been established, and, as a result,
you have had to ask questions from time to time. You
have had no problems with the fund; however, you
realize problems can occur when no guidelines are
established. You have decided to research online for
information about petty cash fund guidelines. Based on
your research, you will create a set of guidelines for
your office. You will write a report with a cover memo
to Ms. Quevedo recommending these guidelines be
adopted. Include the following information in your
report. Be certain you include the URL source(s) for
your information.
• Purpose of Petty Cash Fund
• Restrictions on Petty Cash Use
• Establishing a Fund
• Maintaining the Fund
• Reimbursements of the Fund

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
E
very time you meet another person, whether a visitor or coworker, you are
influencing that person’s image of your company, department, or office. You
should work toward ensuring that each person you meet believes you sin-
cerely want to help him or her. The impression you leave will make each person
want to come back again.
In this chapter you will learn about making appointments, receiving visitors,
managing difficult visitors, and hosting international visitors. Using these skills
efficiently will offer many opportunities to effect a positive image for your com-
pany (Figure 1).
Making Appointments
Who makes appointments for managers? The answer is both managers and their
assistants. The freedom an office professional is given in making appointments
depends on the office professional’s ability to schedule the manager’s time exactly
as he or she wants it scheduled. From the first day on the job, you have two dis-
tinct responsibilities concerning your manager’s appointments: to keep track of
all appointments so one is not overlooked and to keep both your manager’s
appointment calendar and your calendar up to the minute to avoid conflicts in
scheduling.
KEEPING AN APPOINTMENT SCHEDULE
Since both managers and their office professionals make appointments, the trick
with scheduling is to keep the appointment calendar up to the minute to avoid
conflicts. Begin by learning
• what your manager’s preferences are for scheduling appointments.
FIGURE 1 • Knowing how to greet visitors is an important
office skill.
chagin-Fotolia
404

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
• which appointments should be given priority.
• how much time appointments should take.
Your best guides for scheduling appointments will be your knowledge of
your manager’s work habits and your awareness of who his or her business as-
sociates and friends are. You will learn this by observing how your manager uses
time and works with associates and by being aware of your manager’s plans. Re-
member what your manager tells you about how he or she works best. His or
her work habits may vary with the peaks and valleys of the job. Someone once
said the busier one is, the more work one manages to get done. Your manager
may be a person who speeds up when the workload is heavy, scheduling just as
many appointments, but allowing less time for each caller than during a normal
workweek.
Before you leave in the evening, check the appointments your manager has for
the next day to make certain any information or files are available should they be
needed. At some point during the day have a mini-meeting with your manager to
update your calendars. Couple your knowledge of how your manager plans work
with the previous overall suggestions and use them as guides in setting up
appointments.
MAKING APPOINTMENTS BY TELEPHONE OR E-MAIL
When someone requests an appointment by telephone or e-mail, establish immedi-
ately whether your manager is the person the caller should see. You will be able to
decide this as soon as the caller tells you the reason for requesting an appointment.
If your manager has to approve all appointments, tell the caller you must con-
firm the appointment, and you will let the caller know if the appointment has been
set as soon as you can check with the manager. Be sure to follow through on what
you say you will do. Check with your manager and then call the person or send an
e-mail message confirming the appointment.
Office professionals who work for executives, doctors, and dentists usually fi-
nalize an appointment during the initial telephone conversation. You may be
charged with the responsibility for making your manager’s appointments, and
when you are, you can eliminate almost all follow-up telephone calls. Give the
caller a definite appointment. If you have any doubt about your manager con-
firming it, say, “I will call you back immediately if there should be a conflict I do
not know about.” This method is the opposite of following through on all
appointments to confirm them.
Make sure both you and the person seeking the appointment understand the
correct time, date, and location. While you are talking on the telephone, repeat the
date, day, and time and write them down or enter them into your calendar imme-
diately to reduce the chance of a mistake. If your office is located in a difficult-to-
find location, ask callers if they need directions. Unless you already have it, be sure
to get the telephone number and e-mail address of each person who makes an ap-
pointment.You will need the information to confirm the appointment, or you may
need the information to change the time of a definite appointment.
USING AN ELECTRONIC CALENDAR
The traditional calendar has been turned into something that will stagger the
imagination, all because of the personal computer. If your organization has a fully
integrated electronic network, you will be able to use an electronic calendar
405

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
(Figure 2) on your computer to schedule all of your manager’s appointments. Of-
fice automation systems are available that enable the user to switch from one func-
tion to another with a simple keystroke (AltTab in Microsoft® Office) or
movement of the mouse. You can exit an application, such as word processing, to
enter appointments, rearrange the schedule to make substitutions, or cancel ap-
pointments and then quickly return to the application.
Automated calendaring systems allow you to have an accurate, up-to-the-
minute schedule. You can also enter items in the tickler file, add reminders, and
note any items that need to be acted on at a definite time of the day. The page on
the screen looks the same as the page in a desk calendar. You can select a meeting
time by comparing your manager’s schedule with that of others on the network
who make their calendars available.
You need to keep only one computerized calendar for your manager because
either you or your manager can access the calendar at any time. At the end of the
day, you can print or type your manager’s schedule for the next business day and
place it on his or her desk if preferred.
Certain major software programs combine several functions with the calendar.
One of the most popular examples is Microsoft® Outlook. Since many companies
use Microsoft® Office, they also use Outlook because of its e-mail capabilities and
its calendar. Outlook also takes managing your schedule and information a step
FIGURE 2 • Microsoft® Outlook electronic calendar displayed on a computer screen.

further than just a calendar. Outlook allows you to juggle everything from elec-
tronic mail and calendars to contacts and task lists, as you have learned earlier.You
can “connect, communicate, and collaborate,” according to Microsoft®. Outlook
also allows you to work more efficiently to collaborate with others on planning
meetings and conferences.
All early versions of Outlook offered a calendar for the user, but one of the
most popular features in current versions is Outlook’s ability to display multi-
ple calendars side by side. For example, if you have created a separate calendar
for your personal appointments, you can view both your work and personal cal-
endar side-by-side. With the Delegate Access feature in Outlook, one person can
use his or her own copy of Outlook to easily manage another person’s calendar
or e-mail. For example, an administrative assistant can manage the calendar of
his or her manager. When the manager designates the assistant as a delegate, the
assistant can create, move, or delete appointments and can organize meetings
on the manager’s behalf. Another example is the manager planning a meeting
with another person to discuss an issue. You can bring to your display both your
manager’s calendar and the other person’s calendar on the same screen. To share
calendars, a person must give you permission. Assuming the person has given
you permission to view his or her calendar, you may open it and view it in
your window to see when the person is available to meet with your manager.
Outlook’s calendars are color-coded, making it easy to identify each person’s
calendar.
How to Set Up Appointments
✓Leave Monday mornings free to start on plans for the week and
to handle the mail that has accumulated during the weekend.
✓Schedule no appointments for your manager on his or her first
day back after being out of the office for several days.
✓Avoid crowding your manager’s schedule with appointments
the day before he or she leaves on a trip. Preparation for the trip
has priority.
✓Schedule appointments so they do not overlap.
✓Be aware of top-priority meetings and allow plenty of time for
them.
✓Avoid scheduling a top-priority meeting immediately after one
of equal significance.
✓Avoid scheduling an appointment for your manager in another lo-
cation immediately after a meeting that is likely to run overtime.
✓Schedule unstructured time frames of ten to fifteen minutes
between appointments, giving your manager a chance to make
telephone calls, sign letters, think about the next conference, or
just take a break.
✓Schedule appointments with others with whom your manager
has a close working relationship late in the afternoon. These
appointments are easy to shift when your manager is not keep-
ing to the schedule.
✓At the time someone is requesting an appointment by tele-
phone, suggest specific times, preferably giving the person a
chance to select a time from at least two choices.
✓Predetermine regularly scheduled times for answering the mail
and taking care of other daily activities and consistently reserve
the time slots for these activities.
✓Learn which meeting can be limited to fifteen minutes or less.
✓When you are arranging an appointment for a short period, let
the person know the length of the appointment. If you are
setting up the appointment for 2 p.m., say tactfully, “from
2 until 2:15.”
✓When you arrange for an unexpected visitor to see your man-
ager, let the visitor know the next appointment is within ten
minutes if it truly is.
✓Arrange appointments in another part of the city so your man-
ager, if he or she chooses, can go directly from home to an
early-morning appointment or not return to the office after a
late-afternoon appointment.

USING WEB-BASED CALENDARS
The Internet is taking electronic calendars a step further as well by offering Web-
based calendars for free. The best part is they are free. These calendars are scaled-
down versions of the all-in-one scheduling, e-mail, and address-book software that
you find on your desktop computer. In the long run, Web calendars will be more
useful for the following reasons:
• They store information online; therefore, accessibility is a major advantage.
• They are communal, plugged in, and wired to the world.
• They are available in various languages.
• They are integrated with e-mail, address book, instant messaging, and areas
where community groups can publish material.
• Three levels of permission may be offered. Events can be made totally private,
totally visible to everyone from anywhere on the Web, or a hybrid in which
other people can see which time slots are booked but not for what purpose (see
www.calendar.yahoo.com).
The Web-based calendars are becoming important tools in the struggle to at-
tract loyal audiences to commercial sites. Each free calendar asks you to register
and become a member; then, a username or sign-on ID and password are estab-
lished. An example of a free Web-based calendar is Google Calendar. Here are
some of its features:
• Share your schedule. Let your co-workers see your calendar, and view schedules
that others have shared with you.
• Get your calendar on the go. With two-way syncing to your mobile phone’s
built-in calendar or a mobile version of Google Calendar that’s made for the
small screen, you can access your calendar while you’re away from your desk.
• Never forget another event again. Customizable reminders help you stay on
schedule.You can choose to be notified by e-mail or get a text message sent right
to your mobile phone.
• Schedule meetings and track RSVPs. Guests can RSVP to your events by e-mail
or via Google Calendar.
• Sync with your desktop applications. Access your calendar however and when-
ever you want by syncing events with Microsoft® Outlook.
• Work offline. Know where you’re supposed to be even when you don’t have
Internet access. With offline access, you can view a read-only version of your
calendar no matter where you are.

USING PAPER DESK CALENDARS
Your manager may use a computer but does not use an electronic calendar and
prefers to use a paper desk calendar instead. Perhaps computer capacity is limited,
and word processing, database management, and accounting functions are given
priority. Your manager may have the responsibility of keeping his or her own cal-
endar and may prefer not to take the time to enter information in the computer
because of the number of entries and changes required. As a result, you may need
to use desk calendars to keep appointments. Although certainly not necessary,
some managers keep both paper and electronic calendars.
Choose appointment calendars and yearbooks that meet both your manager’s
needs and yours. A wide selection is available, and they are made in a variety of
sizes with a choice of a page for each month, a page for each week, or a page for
each day. Figure 3 shows a monthly calendar.
Executive Appointment Books and Calendars
Managers who make commitments months in advance like a full month displayed
on one page with small insert calendars of the preceding and the following
months. The monthly calendar enables them to review engagements without flip-
ping through several pages. Managers who make several appointments in one day
need a daily appointment calendar.
Many managers prefer pocket calendars or small electronic organizers that in-
clude a calendar, scheduler, and address area for immediate access. An example is
Palm’s Treo™ Pro phone. You can check work and personal e-mail, stay on top of
appointments and contacts, access Wi-Fi (wireless network) or GPS (global posi-
tioning system), and even watch a video on YouTube or listen to songs.

The Office Professional’s Daily Appointment Calendar
If you are not using an electronic calendar, you need a preprinted calendar divided
into fifteen- or thirty-minute segments of each day, with the time printed in the left
column. See Figure 4.
Enter in your calendar all of your manager’s appointments, including re-
minders of tasks that must be taken care of within a given time slot and a list of
all the activities that must be followed through by your manager at the end of
the day. In addition, prepare a to-do list to remind you of other tasks you must
perform at some time during the day.
MAKING ENTRIES IN CALENDARS
All appointments made by telephone, by e-mail, by letter, and in person—including
those appointments your manager makes—should be entered in both the man-
ager’s and your appointment calendars. Regularly scheduled meetings should also
be entered in the appointment calendars.

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
Be consistent and prompt in recording all appointments and commitments in
your manager’s calendar. To do this, adopt a systematic plan for making the en-
tries and then do not deviate from your plan.
Make tentative entries in pencil and firm commitments in ink. As soon as the
appointment is confirmed, write it in ink in both calendars. Write small enough to
put complete information in the space provided in the calendar. Draw a diagonal
line through each entry once the conference is held or the task is completed; then
you will readily know any item not crossed out is yet to be completed.
You may need to request information about appointments your manager
makes, especially those made while away from the office. Do this at least once a
day. If your manager spends a few minutes each morning discussing the appoint-
ments for the day, ask then or suggest that he or she jot down the information and
hand it to you soon after the appointment is made.
Once each day, preferably at the end of the day, check your manager’s calen-
dar with your calendar to make sure all recorded appointments are identical in
both calendars.
At the end of each day, review the items for that day to ensure that all have
been crossed out. In fact, never turn the page of your calendar until you have
searched for incomplete items. Transfer any item that still needs attention to the
page for the following business day.
When you are uncertain whether your manager returned a telephone call or
followed through on a promise he or she made, type a separate note concerning
each item you think might be incomplete at the time you are clearing your cal-
endar. As you check these notes with your manager, you can throw away the un-
necessary notes and give your manager the others as reminders to follow
through.
Once each week, either on Friday afternoon or on Monday morning, check
your tickler file for the entire week. Make notations, if you have not already done
so, in both appointment calendars concerning work that must be completed by a
specified time within the week.
CANCELING APPOINTMENTS
When someone calls to cancel an appointment, always offer to schedule another
one. Be sure to free both appointment calendars, if you keep two calendars, of the
canceled appointment.
When you must cancel an appointment for your manager, let the person whose
appointment is being canceled know at once. Get in touch with the person by tele-
phone or e-mail.

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
Use the following guidelines for canceling an appointment:
• Express regret on your manager’s behalf.
• Mention the appointment must be changed.
• State a reason in general terms.
• Offer to schedule another appointment.
Think twice about how you are going to state the reason. You can say your
manager was called out of town, if he or she was, but as a general rule, do not say
where or why. By doing so you could reveal confidential information. Avoid
dwelling on what your manager cannot do. Quickly shift your conversation to a
positive comment, such as, “She is expected back in the office on Monday. Shall I
set up another appointment for you early next week?”
PREPARING A LIST OF APPOINTMENTS
Some managers prefer to have a separate list of appointments for each day, such
as the one shown in Figure 5. If so, near the end of each day, prepare your man-
ager’s list of appointments for the next business day in a form he or she prefers.
Keep a duplicate copy on your desk. If you are using a computer to keep the ap-
pointment calendar, a printout may be sufficient.
When you keyboard the list, arrange it so that it is easy to read. Use an ap-
propriate heading. For example, if you are keyboarding lists for more than one
person, include the person’s name in the heading. For each appointment, indicate
the time, name of the caller, his or her affiliation, and purpose of the visit. Also,
FIGURE 5 • List of appointments.

include reminders, such as a dinner meeting or a commitment to meet someone at
the airport. When an appointment is someplace other than your manager’s office,
indicate clearly where it will be.
Receiving Visitors
Receiving office visitors is an important part of office work, requiring the office
professional to be gracious and diplomatic at all times and courteous to all visi-
tors. In your contact with visitors, put forth a special effort to represent your man-
ager and your organization favorably. Your duties are threefold:
1. to carry out your manager’s wishes;
2. to present a positive image for yourself, your manager, and the organization;
3. to help visitors, within the policy limitations of the organization, to accom-
plish their purposes for coming to your office.
In some organizations the office professional serves as the receptionist and is
the first person the visitor meets. Large organizations usually have a reception area
in the lobby near the main entrance to the building, and all visitors check in with
the receptionist. Sometimes there are receptionists on more than one floor. A visi-
tor tells the receptionist with whom he or she has an appointment, and then the
receptionist calls the manager’s assistant.
Whether an organization does or does not have a receptionist, the office pro-
fessional usually receives the visitor before the visitor is admitted to the manager’s
office. Therefore, regard receiving visitors as a regular part of your job. As you
plan your work, allow time for receiving visitors.
Among the visitors who come to see your manager will be visitors from out-
side the organization. Many will have appointments and some will not. Some may
be employees who report directly to your manager; others may be managers and
supervisors within the organization, including your manager’s superiors; and oth-
ers will be friends and members of your manager’s family.
Learn your manager’s policy for seeing visitors. What you need to know most
of all is whom your manager will not see and to whom, if anyone, you should di-
rect these visitors. Organizations strive to make friends of all visitors. Therefore,
the policy could be to arrange for visitors, with few exceptions, to see someone
within the organization for a few minutes at least.
An office professional can easily make the mistake of being too protective of
the manager’s time, turning away visitors the manager should see. As a result, the
office professional could destroy favorable relationships that already exist or that
could develop between the manager and others. Guard against being overly pro-
tective of your manager’s time. When you are uncertain, either make an appoint-
ment for the visitor or ask if your manager will see the visitor.

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
Be especially courteous to visitors you must turn away. Ways to arrange an
appointment for a visitor with someone else in the organization and to refuse
appointments are discussed later in this chapter.
GREETING VISITORS
Visitors are influenced by their first impressions of the office and the office pro-
fessional. A favorable first impression and your courteous efforts to make visitors
feel welcome create a receptive climate in which your manager can develop and
maintain a good rapport with others. The visitor’s first impression should be that
of an efficient assistant working in a well-organized office.
One of your duties will be to keep your office in order. A busy office does not
have to be cluttered. As a reminder, to maintain a well-organized office:
1. Designate and use specific locations for supplies, files, and work-in-progress.
2. Remember that completion of each task includes “putting away.”
3. Follow through by clearing your desk of materials you are not using.
If you continually put away items you are not using so nothing accumulates,
the few items you have on your desk will enhance the appearance of your office.
Remember, visitors notice clutter and may assume business is handled the same
way your office appears.
Immediate Attention
Your job is to make all visitors, whether they have appointments or not, feel at
ease. When a visitor comes directly to your office, you should greet the visitor the
minute he or she arrives. As the visitor approaches your desk, look at the visitor
directly, smile graciously, and speak immediately. Nobody likes to be ignored, even
for a few seconds. To continue keyboarding until you reach the end of the line or
paragraph or to continue reading copy is extremely rude. To continue chatting
with another employee is inexcusable. If you are talking on the telephone, the vis-
itor probably will hesitate before approaching your desk. Immediately nod and
smile so the visitor knows you are aware of his or her presence.
Manage to put your materials out of sight of glancing eyes without shuffling
papers in the visitor’s presence. By keeping the materials on which you are work-
ing in a folder, you can unobtrusively close a folder as a visitor nears your desk.
Greet an office visitor by saying “Good morning” or “Good afternoon.” Use
the visitor’s name if you know it. If you are expecting a visitor whom you do not
know, but you are sure who he or she is, use the visitor’s name. The greeting goes
something like: “Good morning, Mr. Slattery. I’m Chris Rogers, Mr. Wilmont’s as-
sistant. Mr. Wilmont is expecting you.”When you receive visitors for several man-
agers, do not guess who they are. Wait for visitors to introduce themselves.
The atmosphere within many organizations is informal, and employees call
their managers by their first names when visitors are not present. However, you
should always call your manager by his or her last name when you are speaking
of your manager and when you are addressing your manager in the presence of
others, particularly international visitors.
Introductions
Here are some easy guidelines for making introductions in the office. In this
example, Mrs. Kensington is your manager.
414

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
• Gender and age have nothing to do with whose
name you state first. In a business relationship, state
the name of the person you want to honor first.
• Make the introduction sound natural. Just state
their names. For example, “Mrs. Kensington, this
is Mr. Adams.” Or simply, Mrs. Kensington . . .
Mr. Adams.” Reserve “May I introduce” or “May
I present” for formal affairs and for very distin-
guished people. You can add the person’s business
after his or her name. For example, “Mrs. Kens-
ington, this is Mr. Adams of Great Lakes Envi-
roTech.” Or you can just use the visitor’s name and
hand the visitor’s business card to your manager.
Advance Preparation
Your manager may need materials from the files—
correspondence and records—to refer to during
meetings. Anticipate what materials will be needed
and locate them the day before, even though you do
not remove them from the files until the next morn-
ing. Learn if your manager wants to review the ma-
terial in advance of the meeting (Figure 6). If not,
take the materials your manager will use during a meeting to his or her office just
before the meeting.
You may have to compile data or collect information from other departments.
Get an early start on these tasks so you will have the information ready when it is
needed. In fact, present information you compile enough in advance for your man-
ager to review it adequately prior to discussing it with someone else.
Your manager will often need special materials for meetings. Anticipate the
needed items and have them ready. They might include
• notes taken during previous meetings.
• brochures to be distributed.
• presentations to supplement a speech.
• lists of names, addresses, and company affiliations of new members of a pro-
fessional group.
• anything else related to the purpose of the meeting.
ATTENDING TO THE VISITOR WHO HAS AN APPOINTMENT
A visitor is a guest; therefore, it is your job to make the visitor feel welcome. Here
are some guidelines to follow:
Make the Visitor Feel Comfortable
Indicate where to leave his or her coat and escort the visitor to your manager’s of-
fice. Pronounce both the visitor’s name and your manager’s name distinctly when
you introduce them. Stand to one side, not between your manager and the visitor,
as you make the introduction. If your manager knows the caller, you can be less
formal. As soon as your manager is available, you can invite the caller to go in. If
appropriate, you may offer the visitor a beverage or ask your manager if anything
is needed before you leave.

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
Invite Visitors Who Must Wait to Take a Seat
Keep current magazines, the morning paper, and other interesting reading mate-
rial nearby so callers who must wait for any length of time can read. You are not
expected to entertain the visitor by carrying on a conversation while he or she is
waiting. You can continue with your work.
Attend to Early Arrivals
A visitor who arrives early expects to wait until the time for the appointment.
However, when your manager is free, tell him or her immediately the visitor has
arrived and ask if he or she is ready to see the visitor. Eventually you will learn
your manager’s preference about seeing visitors ahead of the appointed time. It
will depend on who the visitor is, what the purpose of the visit is, and what tasks
your manager must complete between appointments.
Do Not Keep a Visitor Who Has an Appointment Waiting
The visitor’s time is valuable too, and asking the visitor to wait is inconsiderate. Nev-
ertheless,a manager who has numerous appointments in one day may have difficulty
keeping to an appointment schedule and, when the manager does have difficulty, vis-
itors will have to wait. Having visitors wait occurs even though the manager and the
office professional are making a real effort to usher visitors in and out in the time al-
lotted. When a delay occurs, assure the visitor the wait will not be long. When you
say,“Mr. Wilmont should be available in a few minutes,” you can sound reassuring.
Use this statement only when you anticipate the ongoing meeting is almost over.
The real test of how well you receive office visitors lies in what you say and what
you do when the wait will be long. First of all, do not let your actions reveal the day
is hectic.When emergencies occur or the day is not going smoothly, regardless of the
reason, slow down, put some of your own work on tomorrow’s list, and approach
visitors in a relaxed manner. Give the visitor the impression your only duty at the
moment is to meet his or her needs. Your relaxed manner will be contagious.
Be Cautious About How You State the Reasons for a Delay
You can apologize and say all appointments are running behind schedule, but do
not explain why. Avoid statements referring to important business, problems, or
inefficiency. The visitor is thinking about what is happening to his or her time and
wants to know how long the wait will be. If the wait will be very long, tell the vis-
itor approximately how long. The visitor may decide to make an appointment for
later in the same day or for another day.
Do Not Forget About a Visitor
Reassure the visitor. If you can judge that a conference is ending, turn to the visi-
tor and indicate that it is. If a visitor whose appointment is delayed cannot wait

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
any longer and tells you he or she must leave, offer to make another appointment
and volunteer that your manager will call. Write yourself a note to follow up, for
this visitor has been inconvenienced and deserves special attention.
ATTENDING TO STAFF VISITORS
A critical aspect of every manager’s job is maintaining two-way communication
with the employees who report directly to him or her. In spite of a manager’s effort
to establish an easy flow of two-way communication, breakdowns may occur and
misunderstandings arise, frequently resulting in personnel problems that should
have been avoided.Therefore, many managers announce they have an “open-door”
policy for seeing members of their staff.
Arrange for employees who report to your manager to meet in your manager’s
office or in a conference room designated by your manager. When your manager’s
supervisor requests a conference with your manager, the implied message is your
manager will go to the supervisor’s office unless a specific statement is made to the
contrary concerning the place of the meeting.
TERMINATING MEETINGS
Arrange with your manager how you are to assist in terminating meetings. Be sure
to follow your manager’s preference.
On those days when your manager’s appointment schedule is crowded, watch
the time and tactfully interrupt a meeting, following predetermined guidelines.
One appointment that runs overtime on a busy day can throw all the other ap-
pointments off schedule, inconveniencing many people and giving the impression
of inefficient planning. Find out if your manager wishes you to aid in terminating
appointments of visitors who overstay their time.
When a second visitor arrives promptly for an appointment and someone is in
your manager’s office, but you know your manager wants you to interrupt him or
her, you can proceed in one of the following ways:
1. Send a text message to the manager’s cell phone.
2. Enter the manager’s office, apologize for the interruption, and give the man-
ager the visitor’s business card or name written or typed on a slip of paper. Say
nothing more and exit the office.
3. Enter your manager’s office and say,“Excuse me. Your three o’clock appoint-
ment is here. May I tell her when you can see her?”
4. Call your manager on the interoffice telephone, especially if you think he or
she does not want to be interrupted. Suggest a time for the meeting to end, en-
abling your manager to answer “Yes” or “No” without comment.
5. Send the manager a priority message that will flash or signal on the computer
screen.
If you must remind your manager of an appointment outside his or her own
office and, in addition, you are using the reminder as a means of terminating a
meeting, do not reveal where your manager’s next meeting is or with whom. Your
interruption either in person or by telephone may be all that is needed to prompt
the visitor to leave. If not, it will be adequate to enable your manager to terminate
the conversation.
What should you do when your manager does not have another appointment but
the visitor stays and stays,taking up your manager’s time unnecessarily? This situation
417

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
presents a different problem, but it really should not. Most managers are skilled at ter-
minating office visits. They thank the person for coming, stand, and tactfully make
statements that let the visitor know the meeting is over. At times, however, managers
rely on their office professionals to rescue them from persistent visitors.
INTERRUPTING A MEETING
Until you know, anticipate your manager does not want to be interrupted while
someone is in his or her office. Most managers discourage interruptions while they
are conferring with someone. Nevertheless, the interruptions a manager will tol-
erate are governed by his or her judgment and personality (Figure 7).
You must arrive at a definite understanding with your manager concerning
what conditions are important enough to justify interrupting during a meeting. At
times, your manager may instruct you to interrupt to take a telephone call. At
other times, he or she may indicate there should be no interruptions at all. When
you are left to your own judgment and do not know what to do, do not interrupt.
An intrusion detracts from the tone of a meeting as well as the train of thought.
Whether or not you interrupt your manager when an unexpected visitor comes to
the office will depend on who the person is and the purpose of the visit.
Clearly establish the method your manager prefers you to follow when you must
deliver an urgent message. The following method is frequently used: The assistant
types the message, quietly enters the manager’s office, delivers the message or places
it face down on the desk, and leaves unless an immediate answer is necessary.
To keep telephone interruptions to a minimum, offer to take the message or to
assist the caller yourself. If you cannot help the caller, ask the person to leave his
or her number so your manager can return the call. If your manager has to answer
a telephone call when someone is in his or her office the interruption places the
manager in an awkward position. Your manager needs privacy for a telephone
conversation and does not want to appear discourteous to the visitor by taking up
his or her time with a telephone call.

418

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
When you receive an urgent telephone call for your manager while someone is
in the office, write the name of the person calling and the purpose of the call, de-
liver the note to your manager, and wait for instructions. Your manager will either
give you a message or take the call.
When you receive a telephone call for a visitor, let the visitor know. As you en-
ter the office or conference room, apologize for the interruption. Address the visitor,
tell the visitor who is calling, and ask if the visitor would like to take the call in your
office. When several visitors are in the room, type the message, walk in and hand it
to the person addressed, and wait for the reply. Instead of taking the call, the visitor
may tell you he or she will return the call. Give the message to the person calling,
ask for the number, and type it on a telephone message blank for the visitor.
ATTENDING TO UNSCHEDULED VISITORS
Be just as pleasant and friendly toward the unexpected visitor as you are toward
the visitor who has an appointment. Never judge a visitor by appearance, for ap-
pearance is not indicative of the importance of the person to your manager or to
the organization.
As soon as you greet the visitor, the visitor probably will tell you his or her
name, present a business card, and state the purpose of the visit. Listen carefully
and decide what to do. The visitor could be in your office for any one of many rea-
sons. The visitor could be a member of your manager’s family, a friend, an impor-
tant executive, or an aggressive salesperson.
When the visitor is a member of the family, a friend, or an executive, invite the
visitor to be seated. If there is someone in your manager’s office, you could say,
“Someone is in his office, but I will let him know you are here.” Either write a note
to take to your manager or call him or her on the telephone. Family members may
prefer that you not interrupt your manager, but an executive usually does not show
up unless he or she has something to say immediately. Do not keep an important
executive waiting. Announce his or her arrival.
After you establish a visitor is a friend, offer to let your manager know the
friend is waiting. Sometimes salespeople who should not take up your manager’s
time use this approach. Consequently, keep a conversation going long enough to
be sure you should tell your manager about the visitor. When you are uncertain,
do not risk turning away someone your manager would want to see.
Someone may come to your office and decide not to wait when he or she
discovers it would be inconvenient to see your manager. Always offer to help the
visitor yourself.When you know your manager would like to talk with this person,

ask if the person would like your manager to call him or her. If the visitor indicates
he or she would, write the information on a telephone message blank. Add a note
saying the person came to the office. Even when you do not suggest your manager
will call, let him or her know who came to the office. Your manager can take the
initiative to call.
When a salesperson drops in unexpectedly, ask the purpose of the visit to de-
termine if:
• the salesperson should see someone else.
• you should offer to make an appointment for the salesperson with your manager.
• you should tell the salesperson your manager is not seeking the product or service.
If the salesperson has been calling on your manager, but your manager is no longer
involved in purchasing the product or service the salesperson represents, tell the
salesperson whom to see. Next, call this person, give the salesperson’s name and
business affiliation, explain the salesperson is in your office, and ask the person
with whom you are talking if he or she will see the salesperson. Write down the
name of the person; the person’s title, floor, and office number; and hand the note
to the salesperson. Be courteous enough to explain to the salesperson how to reach
that person’s office.
When your manager is too busy to see a salesperson or observes strict guide-
lines for seeing salespeople, offer to make an appointment. Say you are sorry, but
be sure to end the conversation on a positive note. For instance, say, “We will ex-
pect you at two o’clock on Thursday. Mr. Wilmont will be glad to see you then.”
When you know your manager is not seeking the product or service the sales-
person represents, graciously tell the salesperson so. Obviously, the salesperson
wants an opportunity to convince your manager of the need for the product or
service. Invite the salesperson to leave a business card and literature about the
product or service. Tell the salesperson you will give it to your manager and offer
to contact the salesperson if your manager is interested in learning more about the
product. Suggest the salesperson write your manager a letter or send additional
information.
Remember your job is to make a favorable impression for the organization as
well as run an efficient office. Give a reason, at least in general terms, before you say,
“No.”Visitors who are turned away should feel they have been received courteously.
Occasionally you will encounter visitors who will not state the purpose of their
visit. When you ask, the visitor will say it is personal or confidential.
Here are some hints to use to screen visitors:
• Establish clear guidelines with your manager. If your manager often has visitors
who simply drop by without an appointment, have your manager explain how
aggressive he or she wants you to be. Establish guidelines for when you should
allow the visitor access to your manager.
• Ask direct questions. Most visitors who have legitimate reasons for seeing your
manager will be willing to state the reason. The visitor who is evasive or refuses
to give the reason is often concealing the fact he or she is trying to sell something.
• Offer to help the visitor. If the visitor refuses to explain the purpose of the visit,
try “I am Mr. Hagerman’s assistant. If you explain the nature of your visit, per-
haps I can help you.” If you are sincere and are willing to help, visitors are more
likely to tell you the purpose of the visit.
• Politely be persistent. Keep stating, “I will be glad to help you if you tell me the
nature of your visit,” even though the visitor may try to distract you with other
information.
420

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
• Have the visitor write a note to the manager. Another approach when you are
in doubt about whether your manager might like to see the visitor is to offer a
notepad and an envelope and suggest the person write your manager a note.
Then take the note to your manager. Try to do this between visitors rather than
interrupting while someone is in your manager’s office. Wait for your manager’s
instructions about what to do.
REFUSING APPOINTMENTS
Managers have much work to do in addition to conferring with callers and talk-
ing on the telephone. Some managers plan blocks of time when they hope to work
without interruption.At other times, a manager is forced by the pressure of a dead-
line to devote full time to a task that must be completed.
On those days or half-days when your manager is not seeing anyone, you do
not have to pretend he or she is not in the office or in conference.“In conference”
has been used as an excuse so much it is regarded as a joke. Furthermore, do not
say your manager is solidly booked with appointments except when it is true.Your
manager may change plans and confer with a visitor. If your manager does this,
the visitor will discover your manager is not solidly booked.
Simply state your manager cannot crowd anything more into today’s schedule
and then focus the discussion on future arrangements. Handle telephone requests
and unexpected office visits in the same way. Say when your manager will have
time to see the visitor. Ask questions such as “Shall I ask my manager to call you?”
or “Would you like to make an appointment?” What you suggest would vary ac-
cording to the importance of the request.

Managing Diverse Situations
What can you do when a visitor is aggressive or rude? What about the visitor who
has a language barrier or a special need? Every office professional may experience
meeting these challenging visitors or clients from time to time. Some situations are
undesirable, but some are not. As an office professional, you should learn how to
handle these diverse situations so they will be viewed as benefits to the company,
the visitor, and yourself.

VISITORS AND LANGUAGE BARRIERS
Encounters with visitors can be challenging if they do not speak your language, and
you do not speak theirs. Because of our diverse culture, today many companies
have prepared lists of bilingual employees who can interpret for someone or trans-
late documents. It is quite common for these employees to be paid more for these
services. Also, pictures of bilingual employees are often posted so a visitor will
know who to go to for assistance and where they are located. Bilingual signs stat-
ing available bilingual services are sometimes posted at the company’s entrance.
Here are some helpful suggestions when meeting visitors with language barriers:
• Listen actively—you will have to listen more carefully to a visitor who is not flu-
ent in the English language.
• Do not interpret and finish the sentence the visitor is trying to say. Instead, para-
phrase after your visitor has finished speaking to ensure understanding of what
was said.When they do not speak English at all, attempt to determine their native
language. If you do not recognize the visitors’ language, asking a one-word ques-
tion (“Arabic?” for example), will likely get a response that you can understand.
If the visitors do not speak Arabic, it is highly likely they will recognize what you
are asking and respond with the name of their language in a one-word answer.
• If you do recognize the language and know someone in your area who speaks
it, ask the visitors to take a seat (this may be done with hand motions). Then
call the person who can speak with them, explain the situation, and ask the per-
son if they would please assist you in helping the visitors by translating.
• Don’t assume the visitors do not understand your language—ask. Many times
a person can understand a language but not speak it. If your visitors understand
English, you will be able to explain to them that you are going to ask a co-
worker to translate.
• Always display a positive attitude toward these visitors. Be careful what you say,
verbally and nonverbally. Nonverbal communication can be as effective as voice
in showing your interest and desire to help.
Coming to your office can be a frustrating experience for those visitors, and your
courtesy and understanding will contribute to their favorable impression of your
company.
VISITORS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS
Today’s businesses deal with a diverse clientele, and you are likely to encounter a
number of visitors with special needs, visible and invisible. Be observant of visitors
with special needs, and make them as comfortable as possible. If appropriate, of-
fer to help; don’t wait to be asked. Here are examples of ways in which you can
demonstrate courtesy toward, and show consideration for, those visitors:
1. Hold open the door (if the door does not have buttons that automatically open)
for someone who uses a wheelchair or for someone who has difficulty walking.
2. Make special arrangements to accommodate the needs of all participants of a
meeting. Before booking meetings, ask whether special arrangements will be
needed. If a visitor requires wheelchair access, ensure the meeting is booked
in a room that has an adequate door opening to accommodate the wheelchair.
3. If an interpreter is needed by a participant, arrange for one.
4. Vegetarians will be appreciative of your efforts in meeting their dietary re-
quirements by providing a choice of non-meat dishes at luncheon meetings.

5. Promote the acquisition of at least one telephone that is fitted with technol-
ogy to aid the hearing impaired, and ensure that it is located in an area ac-
cessible to visitors but that will not compromise the confidentiality of your
company. You can direct visitors who are hearing-impaired to this telephone
if they wish to make a call.
6. Encourage basic audio aids that will accommodate the needs of visitors who
are sight-impaired. If your office is accessed by an elevator, point out to your
employer the benefits of having the elevator equipped with audio signals, au-
dible inside and outside the elevator to signal each floor.
7. Show courtesy by facing the visitor with a hearing impairment when talking
to him or her. This will help the visitor who lip-reads to compensate for the
hearing difficulty. Speak up, and enunciate your words carefully.
8. Place a sign both in English and Braille next to a bell if visitors are expected
to ring for service. If you do business with a large number of people who share
a common language, include the message written in their language as well.
9. Post signs in the reception area to inform visitors of special accommodations
that can be made. This will advise them of services such as employees who
speak languages other than English or who know sign language.
10. Familiarize yourself with the location of wheelchair-accessible restaurants,
full-service gas stations, and other businesses in your area that accommodate
special needs. Visitors will often ask you questions if they are unfamiliar with
the area. Your knowledge and helpfulness will ensure that both you and your
employer are perceived as respectful and a customer-oriented organization.
11. Arrange to have a supply of juice and liquids that can be made available to vis-
itors with medical considerations such as diabetes. This small consideration
will reap rewards in terms of goodwill if a visitor experiences sudden low
blood sugar levels that require immediate attention while visiting your office.
As you see, some accommodations for special needs that can be implemented
by you, simply by your consideration and actions, can increase your visitors’ com-
fort and satisfaction. Other accommodations are outside your control and will re-
quire your employer to become involved; they may even require small financial
expenditures. Be proactive in getting your employer involved. Impress them with
your understanding of the benefits the company will accrue when it is recognized
for its commitment to meeting the diverse needs of all its customers.
COMPLAINING CUSTOMERS
When dealing with unhappy customers, these simple principles will help you stay
objective and better enable you to successfully resolve any problem:
• Don’t get emotionally involved in the problem.
• Don’t get defensive or aggressive—it never works.
• Provide solutions, not excuses.
• Customers are not always right, but don’t tell them this.
• All customers have a right to be heard.
• Allowing a customer to abuse you is not acceptable.
• Promising action without action will lead to a customer service disaster.
• Sorry without corrective action is just an empty word.
• Preventing problems is easier than resolving them.

ABUSIVE VISITORS
How do you deal with a visitor who is obnoxious or one who makes you feel
threatened? Dealing with unwanted visitors is something you need to discuss with
your office team. Your colleagues may be able to provide names of people who
have an abusive history with your office and are, therefore, not welcome in the of-
fice. Your company should have an organizational policy for handling unwanted
callers where security officers can assist you if needed. If there is a company pol-
icy, follow it. If no policy exists, your office team should draft a policy and submit
it to management for approval.
Abuse from customers can come in several forms. For example, a customer might
attempt verbal abuse such as swearing, shouting, or even threatening employees.
Physical abuse also takes place in offices where customers get angry enough to push
people or throw items.
As an office professional, you are expected to be diplomatic, courteous, and
to treat all colleagues and customers with respect. However, under no circum-
stances should you tolerate abuse. You should model professional behavior for
people who are being abusive toward you. The best way to do this is to treat oth-
ers with dignity and respect and in the way you would like to be treated in re-
turn. If they continue to be abusive, remain professional and courteous, but take
control of the situation. If you have exhausted your diplomacy your next step
might be
• call your supervisor for assistance to deal with the abusive customer.
• ask the customer to leave the premises and state that you will deal with him or
her when calmed down.
• in extreme cases, tell the customer that his or her actions are not acceptable and
you will call security.
Many office buildings have security twenty-four hours per day. If this is the
case in your company, you would call security to have an abusive individual re-
moved. Every organization wants to provide excellent service, but abuse toward
employees should never be tolerated.
The following tips can help turn an undesirable situation into one that is sat-
isfactory to both parties:
1. Use common courtesies. Immediately learn the visitor’s name and use it along
with the appropriate courtesy title (Mrs., Mr., Ms., Dr., or some other). Be sure
your tone of voice and body language always convey a positive and sincere
message.
2. Listen to the visitor. Listen to the spoken words, but also listen to the 
unspoken—that is, to the tone of voice and the body language. Often there is
more information in what visitors don’t say than what they do say. Listen
quietly and carefully as the visitor explains the source of distress. Take notes
if necessary and ask questions to ensure clarity.
3. Apologize if it is appropriate to do so. If your company has not performed to
the highest of standards, a full apology is in order. Remember to use your tone
of voice and body language to reinforce the sincerity of your message.
4. Show empathy and understanding. Demonstrate you have listened carefully,
and you understand the visitor’s reason for distress. Paraphrasing the cus-
tomer’s story may be helpful.
424

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
5. Promise follow-up. Commit to assisting the visitor yourself or to having some-
one else take action. Tell the visitor exactly what your action plan will be and
when he or she can expect to hear from you.
If you follow these basic rules, a more satisfactory situation should result in
maintaining your visitor’s goodwill.

Office Security
You should be aware of any procedures established to safeguard your own per-
sonal security within the office setting. No one should take security for granted.
Many office buildings have security twenty-four hours a day. If this is the case and
you feel threatened, you should call security to have an individual removed. Here
are some tips to follow:
• Contact the corporate security force if there is one or call the police emergency
number (911). Have phone numbers for office security, local police, and ambu-
lance numbers near or taped on your telephone for quick reference.
• Challenge visitors or individuals walking through your office. Try to determine
who they are visiting by asking if they need assistance.
• Do not let anyone into your building with your access keys or card as you en-
ter after regular business hours.
• If you have your own office, be sure to lock the door when you leave for lunch
or to attend meetings.
• When it gets dark early at certain times of the year, use the “buddy” system
when leaving your office building.
• Always keep valuables out of sight, including purses, cash, and stamps. Lock
them in a desk drawer or file cabinet if possible.
• Place small pocket calculators or recorders in desk drawers when not in use.
• Do not allow unknown or unexpected maintenance personnel free access to
your office space without checking to see if they are authorized to be there.
Remember security is everyone’s responsibility, and you should use sound preven-
tive measures to safeguard yourself, your property, and the property in the office.

Ethics and Visitors
You must at all times be careful what information you give to a visitor when the
visitor is waiting for your manager or others. Customers will often ask questions
of a confidential nature to get ahead of any competition. Here are some areas to
avoid when casually chatting with waiting visitors:
• Avoid sharing confidential information about products, office gossip, company
successes, or problems. You might think this would not be difficult, but what if
the person asking is a close friend? A relative? Your manager? The situation then
becomes more difficult.
• Treat each visitor equally. When two or more visitors appear, use the “first
come, first served” rule. Acknowledge both visitors, but invite the second visi-
tor to have a seat while you help the first.
• Don’t ask questions of a personal nature. A visitor may be offended by ques-
tions that appear to be prying into his or her personal life. Don’t discuss family,
children, religion, or politics. Remember, you have work to do.
• Never assume based on the color of a person’s skin he or she is from a certain
country. For instance, a person from Nepal may look similar to someone from
India. You should not ask or make reference to a person’s country of birth.
What you must always remember is you choose your behavior, and your be-
havior should always be to choose what is right or most right in all situations. Dur-
ing times when you are handling visitors, keep in mind your organization’s code
of ethics as well as your own values.

Hosting International Visitors
If your manager travels to meet international clients, it’s very possible those clients
will also visit your office (see Figure 8). The work of handling international clients
requires a completely new set of knowledge and skills.
Being able to build positive relationships with international clients is highly de-
sirable and worth achieving. The best advice is to be flexible, adaptable, and
tolerant (FAT). Remember, the experiences and customs of international visitors
are different than yours. This is your chance to learn and grow. Here are some tips
for your success:
1. Do your homework! The comfort of your guests should be your top priority.
This means researching their culture and company and incorporating as much
426

Scheduling Appointments and Receiving Visitors
of their custom into the visit as possible. Have enough information so you can
show an interest and ask intelligent questions.
2. Learn a few words and phrases in the visitor’s language. Examples might be
Hello, How are you?, Please, Thank you, Goodbye, and It was a pleasure to
meet you. Even a few words and phrases will demonstrate to the client you
are interested in the client and the country. One suggestion is to write the
word welcome in the visitor’s language, at the top of the meeting agenda.
3. Locate the client’s nearest consulate’s office. As a courtesy to your interna-
tional clients, have handy the nearest consulate’s location, phone number, and
ambassador’s name for reference should you need them. This information is
available on the Internet.
4. Keep an open mind. Do not judge behavior by your own standards. Attitudes,
values, manners, greetings, and gestures may be foreign to you and at times
may even seem to be bad manners and in poor taste. They are not! They are
simply the product of a different culture.
5. Listen carefully. Your international client may speak in broken English. Do
not correct his or her pronunciation. Just remember a visitor’s English may be
a lot better than your Arabic, Japanese, German, or Spanish.
6. Research cultural attitudes about time. As you learned earlier, different cul-
tures treat time differently. In the United States time is a priority, and we ex-
pect people to follow schedules closely, to be on time for meetings, to complete
projects before the deadline, and to show up when and where they say they
will. This makes it difficult for us to schedule meetings, complete projects, and
close deals. Keep this in mind when scheduling meetings and be as flexible as
possible.
7. Learn the preferred eating habits of the country. Although many international
visitors are open to experimenting with new foods, many are not. For exam-
ple, some cultures do not eat pork. In this case, it would be a gross error to
arrange a meal where pork is on the menu. Be certain coffee and lunch breaks
include food and beverages the international clients will enjoy.

8. Determine if gender plays a stronger role in the client’s culture than our own.
In certain cultures, women do not hold high-level positions where decisions
are made. In this case, conversation is often directed from the international
client to the male members at meetings. The gender issue is important for a
company to know before deciding whom to send to negotiate in the board-
room or even whom to send abroad as the best company representative.
9. Identify the proper greetings. Greeting visitors in the United States is done
with a firm handshake, whereas in many other cultures, bowing and kissing
are the norms. In some cultures, men and women do not touch. Although
women and men in these cultures do not shake hands, members of the same
gender may deliver a very warm and physical greeting.
10. Be aware of body language. A friendly hand gesture in one country can be ob-
scene in the next and even illegal in another. Pay attention to how others use
gestures (movements of the hands, arms, legs, or head) to say what they mean.
11. Pleasantries come before business. Unlike in the United States, many cultures
do not do business until they have established a relationship with you. This
may mean many cups of tea and a lot of social conversation before business
topics are ever broached.
12. Learn to pronounce names correctly. If needed, find how to pronounce the
visitor’s name correctly. In some cultures, such as Chinese and Korean, the
family’s surname is placed first and then the given name. You will make a
lasting impression on your visitor if you use his or her name correctly. Learn
the titles of respect that go with others’ names and when it is appropriate to
use them.
13. Determine if physical space when talking is different from our culture. People
may feel differently about space or distance in communication than you do.
When receiving visitors from outside your culture, pay attention to what is
considered an appropriate distance between you and the visitor when talk-
ing. With some visitors, standing too far away may be interpreted as being
unconcerned, too formal, or too distant. On the other hand, if you stand too
close to a visitor, it may be interpreted as your being too casual or too infor-
mal. Learn how to use space or distance to your advantage so as not to of-
fend visitors.
The bottom line is you want your international visitors to have a pleasant, pos-
itive visit to the United States and a visit that produces a profitable, yet rewarding
relationship. With more and more U.S. companies establishing offices outside the
United States and more foreign businesses establishing offices here, you are likely
to need to develop your skills in this area.

Ms. Quevedo has a very busy week full of meetings with
an international delegation that is visiting to discuss a
new line of appliances. The delegates are
Mr. Abdulla from Cairo, Egypt
Mrs. Yoko from Tokyo, Japan
Mr. Schneider from Berlin, Germany
Ms. O’Neil from Dublin, Ireland
Throughout the week, you have a number of requests to
interrupt the meetings. In each case, you key a message. De-
pending on the situation,you might take the message into the
meeting and leave it with the appropriate person; or you
might send a text message to his or her cell phone. Regard-
less, you key the text. If you want to give the guest a return
telephone number,be sure to provide the international access
code, country code, and city code when appropriate. Key
messages on one page for the following situations:
1. Tuesday, March 11 at 11:30 a.m.—You receive a call
from Mrs. Yoko’s son in Tokyo saying he needs to
speak to his mother. When you tell him she is engaged
in a meeting, he says his call is urgent and relates to his
father’s health. The telephone number that shows on
your electronic message system is 81 3-3375-3211.
2. Thursday, March 13 at 8:30 a.m.—You receive a
call from the local Delta Airline office regarding
Ms. O’Neil’s flight home to Dublin. Apparently, the
Air France flight from New York to Dublin has been
cancelled and Delta is trying to reschedule people onto
different flights. They are offering a flight tomorrow
on Delta out of Rochester (ROC) at 11:25 a.m. arriv-
ing in New York (JFK) at 12:52 p.m., there will be a
long layover of 6 hours and 33 minutes at JFK. She
will transfer to Air France which departs at 7:25 p.m.
and arrives in Dublin (DUB) at 7:50 a.m. Because you
know that she has an 8 a.m. meeting tomorrow, you
know she will have plenty of time to make the two
flights. Otherwise, there is nothing available until Sat-
urday evening at 8:30 p.m. which would require her
to stay over another day. The number showing on
your electronic message is (585) 433-2121.
3. Thursday, March 13 at 12 noon—You receive a call
from a Mr. Mohammad, who works at Tulipe in
Cairo. Tulipe is an appliance store. This is the same

Manager. Mr. Mohammad insists on telling Mr.
Abdulla some very good news regarding a successful
sale to one of the company’s clients. He wants to talk
to Mr. Abdulla immediately. The number showing on
your electronic message is20 2 797-3388.
4. Friday, March 14 at 11:30 a.m.—A call is received,
but you cannot understand the caller very well. He has

Making Travel Arrangements
A
nyone who works as an executive or administrative assistant will likely
encounter making travel arrangements at some point in their careers. If you
work for a manager who travels, you should
• become thoroughly familiar with the organization’s travel policies.
• know what travel accommodations are available and how to schedule them to
meet the manager’s preferences.
• ensure procedures are followed and office tasks are completed while the man-
ager is away.
• apply the reimbursement policies.
Planning the Trip
Before you proceed to make travel arrangements, ask questions about the organi-
zation’s policies and procedures. For example:
• Who is responsible for making travel arrangements?
• Do designated office professionals handle the travel arrangements for all the
managers of the organization?
• If the services of a travel agency are used, which agency?
• Which class of flight service do travelers fly?
• What is the policy concerning the use of private cars and car rental services?
• Does the organization have a preference for a particular airline? If so, what are
the policies for using it?
• How are payments for reservations handled?
• What is the procedure for getting a cash advance for a traveler?
• How is the manager reimbursed for additional travel expenses?
As soon as you have answers to these questions, you will know whether to turn
over the arrangements to someone else or to make them yourself. Regardless of who
makes the arrangements, try to request all reservations far enough in advance to en-
sure you obtain the travel arrangements at the best price and accommodations desired.
INTERNET TRAVEL SERVICES
Using the Internet to make airline bookings is efficient and accurate. The Internet
offers an abundance of information that will help the office professional plan busi-
ness trips. By searching the Web site of a travel service company, the office profes-
sional may access information regarding
• passports;
• visas;
• flight schedules;
• latest pricing;
• telephone numbers;
• travel tips;
• e-mail, fax, and postal mailing addresses.

When reservations are made through the Internet, the subscriber pays for the
tickets with a credit card number. In addition to providing a confirmation number
which can be printed directly from the computer, the Internet travel service faxes or
e-mails a ticket voucher containing trip details to the subscriber. This documenta-
tion replaces the traditional paper ticket when the traveler checks in at the airport.
TRAVEL AGENCIES
Before you call a travel agency, be certain you have already reviewed the travel
procedure for using this resource. If your company authorizes the use of a travel
agency, you will definitely appreciate their services when you make arrangements
for international travel; you may find that working through a travel agent is the
easiest and best way to make arrangements for domestic travel as well.
Travel agents receive their commissions from the airlines, hotels, and other
organizations whose services they sell and do not charge your organization for
services. Local travel agencies are listed in the classified section of the telephone
directory. If you are concerned about finding a reputable agency, call the Better
Business Bureau to inquire about local travel agencies.
441

Making Travel Arrangements
Most travel agents are approved by the International Air Transport Association
(IATA). IATA is a conglomerate of international airlines. It allows travel agencies that
meet its stringent requirements to use its insignia.An agency seeking IATA’s approval
must have a solid reputation and the financial backing to ensure its own stability.
Travel agencies use the Internet to maintain up-to-the-minute information on
all airline schedules and hotel accommodations. Because of their experience and
business connections, travel agents can obtain information quicker and find avail-
ability and better prices than most people who do their own bookings.
The travel agent represents all the transportation lines, hotels, and motels, not
just certain ones. You, of course, must provide the travel agent with all the details
needed. When planning a trip, try to work with only one person at the agency and
rely on that person to prepare the complete package. The travel agent will create
an itinerary, secure tickets, make hotel reservations, arrange for car rental, and per-
form other services related to the trip.
For international travel, travel agents perform many other services. They pro-
vide some information on visas and how you can obtain one, provide information
about how much baggage is allowed, furnish guidebooks for the countries being
visited, and explain travel restrictions and regulations for bringing foreign pur-
chases through U.S. customs. Travel agents do not give advice on immunizations,
however. That advice should be obtained through your local health authority.
TRIP INFORMATION NEEDED
As soon as your manager mentions a trip, start compiling information. Before you
contact a travel agent or an airline carrier, compile the details concerning:
1. destination;
2. intermediate stops, either going or returning or both;
3. date of departure and return;
4. date and time of the first business appointment and the time needed between
arrival and the appointment;
5. preferred time for day of travel;
6. method of travel—air, auto, rail;
7. type of service—business class, economy class;
8. preferred service provider (i.e., airline);
9. preferred seat selection—aisle? window? front or back of the plane?
10. special accommodations (dietary restrictions, wheelchair access);
11. hotel preference or the desired location of the hotel within the city;
12. need for transportation at the destination or at intermediate stops;
13. hotel amenities required (conference facilities, wireless Internet, multimedia
equipment);
14. need for transportation at the destination or at intermediate stops;
15. make or size of the car preferred if car rental is required.
For use in planning future trips, maintain a folder labeled “Trip Preferences.”
When your manager returns from a trip, you should add comments about the trans-
portation and hotel accommodations on a copy of the agenda for the trip. In this
folder, keep the manager’s comments and all other information that will help you
recall preferences when you are planning another trip to the same city or part of
the country. If you plan trips for more than one manager, maintain a Trip Prefer-
ences folder for each person. Figure 1 is an example of a trip-planning checklist.

Arranging the Travel
Making transportation arrangements for international travel is similar to making
arrangements for domestic travel. When planning travel, you should consider the
effect of a long trip through different time zones. Refer to Chapter 5 for a discus-
sion of time zones around the world. Jet lag is a condition that is characterized by
various physical and psychological effects, such as fatigue and irritability, follow-
ing a long flight through several time zones. When planning an overseas trip, ask
your manager about preferences for an adequate rest period following arrival in
the country to be visited and following the return home.
To make travel arrangements with ease, you should know about air travel services
and other types of transportation, including how to arrange for car rental services;
how to make hotel reservations; how to obtain passports and visas for international
travel; and what is involved in meeting immunization requirement if needed.
AIR TRAVEL
Because many managers are required to fly to meetings in different cities, you need
to be well informed about air travel services.
Sources of Air Travel Information
You can obtain air travel information about a specific trip by telephoning a local
travel agent or specific airline. However, all this information is easily accessible on
the Internet.
Types of Flights
When making arrangements, consider the flights available in this order:
1. a nonstop flight, which is uninterrupted from point of departure to destination;
2. a direct flight, on which, regardless of the number of stops en route, the pas-
senger remains on the same plane from departure to destination;
3. a connecting flight with another flight of the same airline;
4. a connecting flight with another flight of another airline.
When a passenger changes aircraft without changing airlines, the gate for the
connecting flight may be near the deplaning gate. The distance between boarding
gates of two different airlines at a major airport may be far, and walking or being
shuttled from one gate to another is time consuming. If the first flight is delayed,
the passenger may not have enough time to meet the connecting flight.
444

Making Travel Arrangements
Because delays cannot be predicted, use wise judgment when making reserva-
tions; if the traveler must make a connection, allow adequate time between the
flights. Remember that many airports have more than one terminal and that many
cities have more than one airport. A connection between two different airports in
a large city can often take two hours or longer. Think of the activities involved:
deplaning, picking up baggage, getting transportation to the second airport, and
locating and boarding the next flight.
Commuter flights are short direct flights between two neighboring cities. These
neighboring cities need to be close enough that significant numbers of travelers use
the service as a convenience. Many business travelers rely on commuter flights to
meet with clients or colleagues in neighboring cities and even to go to work each day.
These flights leave frequently—often every hour. Although reservations are recom-
mended, they are often not required because of the frequent schedules.
Classes of Service
The services passengers receive aboard the plane—especially where they sit and the
food and beverages served—are purchased by class of service. The basic classes of
service that most travelers use are business class and economy class. The priority
services for business class traveling include expeditious check-in and boarding as
well as additional comfort and service during the flight.
Some organizations allow their executives to fly business class because it
provides wider seats with more legroom and working room—an important con-
sideration on long flights. Other organizations, for obvious financial reasons, re-
quire their executives to fly economy class. Although the economy class is the most
common way to fly, it has less space between seats and offers little to no service.
Flight Reservations
You can make a flight reservation yourself through the Internet or by simply tele-
phoning the airline reservations office. The tickets can be paid for by providing a
credit card number and then receive them through e-mail, through regular mail,
or at the airport reservations desk.
Many airlines no longer print a paper ticket; instead, they prepare electronic
tickets (e-tickets). The system now works like this:
• Book the reservation over the telephone or Internet.
• Include the traveler’s frequent flier card number, a card that provides extra
benefits.
• Use a credit card or company charge account to pay for the tickets.
• Receive a faxed or e-mailed itinerary and confirmation from the airline carrier.
• An hour before departure, proceed to the airline ticket counter or baggage
check-in, state the flight number for which he or she has reservation, show iden-
tification, and receive a boarding pass.
A popular and quick method to check in and receive a boarding pass is to use a
kiosk. The traveler approaches the device, scans a credit card, and confirms the
reservation by following the easy steps. Once the steps are completed, the board-
ing pass is issued by the computer.
Before you contact the airline reservations office, collect all the trip informa-
tion you need for making a flight reservation. The reservations agent will be using
a computer system that stores all the reservations.The agent will establish whether
the space you want is available. If it is, make the reservation during the initial
445

Making Travel Arrangements
contact.When the traveler does not know the return date, purchase an open ticket,
a booking arrangement for some forms of transportation where the scheduling de-
tails of the return trip are not specified. As soon as the traveler knows the return
date, call the agent and make the return reservation.
If space is not available on the desired flight, proceed with alternative plans.
Inquire about earlier and later flights with the same airline and with other airlines.
Reconfirmation of airline reservations is required on international flights. The
traveler should reconfirm reservations for each part (also called leg) of the trip.
Making Online Reservations
Booking the airline reservations online can be efficient for the office assistant. The
assistant can access the availability of flights in minutes. Alternative schedules can
be printed and then compared and selected by the traveler. Keep in mind that exec-
utive travel and flight plans change frequently and rapidly. Although the office pro-
fessional can save time and make changes promptly online, travel agents are more
up to the minute on price and schedule changes that may have occurred since the
reservation was made.
Many executives like to make their own reservations. If your manager makes
his or her reservations, become familiar with them. Doing so will allow you to
change the reservations if needed.
Timetables
No two airline timetables are identical, and airline timetables are different from
rail timetables. Timetables are easy to read when you know what to look for. All
carriers publish electronic and paper timetables and update them often.
Reading the Twenty-four-hour Clock
For air travel, the times shown are based on the twenty-four-hour clock. This is to
eliminate confusion between a.m. and p.m. Under this system, time begins at one
minute past midnight (0001) and continues through the next twenty-four hours to
midnight (2400). Refer to Figure 2.
Ground Transportation
Airports are often located twenty or more miles from cities; for that reason, one
or more types of ground transportation—airport limousine, taxi, bus, and car
rental—are available at all airports.
The distance and direction of the airport, the travel time needed, the types of
ground transportation available, and approximate costs are listed
in the Official Airline Guide (OAG) for all destination cities. The
transportation services are coded as follows: limousine (L), taxi
(T), car rental (R), and air taxi (A). To determine what arrange-
ments to make for ground transportation, ask the airline reserva-
tions agent or your travel agent.
Limousines and shuttle bus services operate on a regular basis

by jet aircraft. Compared to the cost of other types of transportation, air taxi ser-
vice is expensive; however, it saves time.
A traveler who must make a connecting flight at an airport may need air taxi
service in order to make the connection. On domestic flights, avoid scheduling a
connecting flight that involves a second airport. When people travel abroad, they
may have to make a connection involving two airports because the traveler’s
incoming flight may arrive at one airport and the next flight may depart at
another. Before making a reservation for air taxi service, find out about airport
limousine or bus shuttle service between the central terminals serving the
airports involved.
CAR-RENTAL SERVICES
The best way to arrange for a car rental is either to telephone the local office of
the car-rental agency or to access the agency online.
The largest car-rental agencies offer both domestic and international car-rental
services, publish worldwide directories of their services, provide a toll-free num-
ber for making reservations, and have a Web site with reservation facilities. Here is
a list of car-rental agencies:
• Hertz
• Avis
• Enterprise Rent-A-Car
• Budget
• National Car Rental
When you are making arrangements for car-rental, specify the following:
• city, date, and time;
• size of car desired, such as small-range or mid-range;
• location where the car is to be picked up;
• name of the person who will pick up the car;
• location where the car is to be returned;
• the length of time the car will be used;
• method of payment for the charges;
• map with directions from car-rental center to destination.
A car can be picked up at the agency right at the airport or near the airport
when the passenger arrives. All the traveler has to do upon arrival is to go to the
airport car-rental office, present a driver’s license, and complete arrangements for
payment of charges.

Charges incurred are payable at the completion of the rental, but the arrange-
ments for payment must be made in advance. Major credit cards are accepted.
Cash may not be accepted.At the time you are making the reservation, be prepared
to give the account number and the expiration date of the credit card to be used
for payment. Your organization may have arrangements with car-rental agencies
entitling you to a discount.
HOTEL RESERVATIONS
Many hotels provide a toll-free number for making reservations. You can obtain
the toll-free number for the hotel by calling directory assistance at 1-800-555-
1212 or by accessing the Internet.
If you are not familiar with the hotels in the destination city, contact a local
travel agent. Most international accommodation information changes so rapidly
that agents consult online computer information, which is updated frequently.
Many of the larger hotels and resorts have their own Web sites, so it’s possible to
access this information and make your own reservations. Most hotel and resort
Web sites provide online booking services and toll-free telephone numbers.
Here are some ways to save your organization money:
• Search the Internet for Web sites that specialize in offering “best” rates. For ex-
ample, www.hotels.com and www.expedia.com are sites specializing in travel
and hotel rates.
• Book the right kind of room. Some hotel chains offer the option of rooms for
business travelers. These rooms cost slightly more per night but can save money
in the long run because they do not charge phone access fees. Phone access
charges can add up quickly when your manager is calling customers, getting
messages from the office, accessing the Internet, and so on. Some hotels offer
high-speed Internet access as well, usually for a daily charge or offer wireless
service. When making hotel reservations, be aware of the additional charges for
these rooms, your manager’s preferences, and your company’s policies about re-
imbursement rates.
• Check out concierge levels. Some hotels provide concierge-level rooms that in-
clude breakfast, newspapers, and an afternoon snack and drink buffet.
Although these rooms carry a higher rate, their cost is often less than your man-
ager may spend on purchasing meals and periodicals.
• Avoid large hotel chains. Most major cities have cost-effective alternatives to the
major hotel chains, such as independent hotels, short-stay efficiency apart-
ments, or other money-saving alternatives. Again, be certain to ask your man-
ager about his or her preference when it comes to reserving hotels.
Always ask for a confirmation of a hotel reservation. When the operator
gives you a confirmation number or an electronic confirmation note, be sure to

attach it to the itinerary so that the traveler will have it should there be any ques-
tion about the reservation. Hotels require a deposit when you request that a
room be held for late arrival. This is called a guaranteed reservation. Make the
request and arrange for the deposit to guarantee the room. Major credit cards
are accepted by hotels to reserve the room for late arrival. Late arrival is usually
after 6 p.m. Be aware: If the reservation is not used, someone should cancel the
reservation, as the credit card holder will be responsible for charges. Many hotels
require twenty-four- to forty-eight-hour notice of cancelation, or the credit card-
holder will be charged.
PASSPORTS
A passport is an internationally recognized travel document that verifies the iden-
tity and nationality of the bearer. A passport allows the bearer free passage within
the bearer’s borders. It entitles the bearer to the protection of his or her own coun-
try and that of the countries visited.
A U.S. citizen who goes abroad must carry a passport. In addition, travelers to
and from the Caribbean, Bermuda, Panama, Mexico, and Canada must have a
passport to enter or reenter the United States.
To apply for a passport, a person must complete an application form. The
application usually is made locally, but the issuance of passports is under the
jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of State. The addresses of passport acceptance
facilities in your area are available on the Internet at http://travel.state.gov. The
application form gives complete details for applying for a passport. A passport is
valid for ten years.
VISAS
Many countries require foreign travelers to hold a visa. A visa is a stamped per-
mit to travel within a given country for a specified length of time. The visa is usu-
ally stamped or attached inside the passport. However, some countries provide
loose visa documents so the visa can be removed when traveling to uncooperative
countries.
Well in advance (in some cases, up to three months) of the departure date, the
office assistant or the traveler should check passport and visa requirements with
the consulates of the countries to be visited. The traveler should obtain the neces-
sary visas before going abroad.
Visa requirements are subject to change, and they can change rapidly. Trav-
elers should apply directly to the embassy or nearest consulate of each country
that he or she plans to visit or consult a travel agent. Most foreign consular rep-
resentatives are located in principal U.S. cities, particularly New York, Chicago,
New Orleans, San Francisco, Houston, Dallas, and Washington, D.C. The ad-
dresses of foreign consular offices in the United States may be obtained by con-
sulting the Official Congressional Directory, available in many public libraries,
or city telephone directories or by accessing the Internet at http://www.state.gov/
s/cpr/rls/fco/.
After obtaining a passport, the traveler must send it to each consulate involved
to obtain visas. The time and level of patience it takes to process a visa after it
reaches a consular office can vary from one day to three weeks. Allow ample time
and use prepaid courier services whenever possible to send the documents. Some
travel agents are experienced in obtaining visas, but you do not need to rely on
travel agents because the process is usually straightforward.

IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS
The International Health Regulations adopted by the World Health Organization
(WHO) stipulate that vaccinations may be required as a condition of entry to any
country. The WHO sends communications to local health departments advising
them of required and recommended immunization for travelers. Additional infor-
mation on major health risks to travelers to various countries can also be found
on the WHO’s Web site.
For travel to many countries, an International Certificate of Vaccination is not
required. If the traveler needs an immunization certificate, he or she can obtain it
from the local health department. The form must be stamped by the office where
the vaccinations are administered.
SECURITY
All travelers, both national and international, should be aware of security issues.
For the office professional who makes travel arrangements and who helps the ex-
ecutive prepare for the trip, here are some factors to consider:
• Travel to and through some countries can put Americans at risk. When book-
ing flights, choose reputable airlines and, if possible, avoid countries that are un-
friendly to Westerners.
• Location is a critical consideration when booking hotels. Be certain you book
reputable hotels in safe locations.
• Security at airports is heavy. Executives who travel should expect to have their
notebook computers, digital pocket organizers, pagers, cell telephones, and
briefcases thoroughly examined before they board a flight. At different security
levels, some of these items may be required to be packed in checked baggage
rather than carry-on bags.
• Batteries in the computer and pocket organizer should be charged. With in-
creased airport security, people carrying electronic devices may be asked to start
these machines to prove they are truly business tools.
• Many airports insist on jackets and shoes being removed as travelers pass
through security.
• Travelers should expect to answer questions about why they are traveling to cer-
tain countries. Is it for business? If so, what business?
• Travelers should carry their passports and their immunization cards (for some
countries) on their person because government officials can request these doc-
uments at any time.
• Gifts for clients should not be wrapped prior to boarding the flight. Airport se-
curity can insist that you unwrap all parcels for inspection.
• Travelers should expect to be searched by security officers if any level of metal
registers as they pass through the metal detection gate.

Making Travel Arrangements
Following Through
Although administrative assistants can rely on a travel agent when planning a trip,
they are directly responsible for checking the completeness and the accuracy of the
final arrangements.
PRIOR TO THE TRIP
Just before your manager leaves on a business trip, your main duties will include
airline confirmations; getting a cash advance, if needed, for the trip; preparing the
schedule; assembling materials for the trip; perhaps arranging to have new busi-
ness cards made; and getting instructions about special responsibilities you will
have in your manager’s absence.
Checking Tickets
If you have the responsibility for checking flight reservations, be sure to do so at
least twenty-four hours before the flight. Obtain the information in enough time
to check the details carefully. First compare the information about the flights with
what your manager requested; then thoroughly check each item on the e-ticket
with the itinerary. The information about the flights and the travel portion of the
itinerary should be identical.
Requesting Travel Funds for the Trip
Credit cards, such as American Express®, Visa®, and MasterCard® make it possi-
ble to travel without carrying large sums of money. Most people rely on credit
cards while traveling.
To cover the expenses of the trip, some travelers prefer cash. In this case, many
organizations will provide a cash advance to employees who travel. If this is the
policy in your organization, complete the required form, and obtain the cash.
Figure 3 shows a travel fund advance form. Although forms vary, it is important
on all forms to complete all appropriate blanks with accurate information. This
will help avoid delays in receiving the travel advance.
Whether you are obtaining cash from a bank or from the cashier of your or-
ganization, get some small bills to be used for tips.
Most business travelers take limited cash and carry their American Express®,
Visa®, or MasterCard® credit cards.
Cash in the foreign country’s local currency is readily available through auto-
matic teller machines found in international hotels.
Understanding Per Diems
One of the first things you will need to understand is the per diem rate. Per diem
is a Latin term meaning “per day.” It means an amount of money determined by
the company it will pay per day to traveling employees for expenses. There is usu-
ally a meal per diem and sometimes an accommodation per diem.
Become familiar with your organization’s policies, as they vary among com-
panies. Some companies allow travelers to claim more than the per diem if receipts
can be provided, whereas other companies expect their travelers to cover their own
expenses beyond the per diems allowed. Be sure to check your company’s per diem
rates and policies before you make travel arrangements.

Preparing the Itinerary
Usually, an itinerary is a combined travel and appointment schedule. Even with the
use of personal digital assistants, the travel itinerary and the schedule of confirmed
appointments can also be prepared as two separate paper lists. An itinerary shows
when, where, and how the traveler will go. It should include the
• day;

• local time of departure and arrival;
• name of airport;
• flight numbers;
• place of departure and arrival;
• car-rental information;
• name of hotel, telephone, and fax numbers for each overnight stay on the trip.
The itinerary should also include details about confirmed appointments.
Examples of such details might be
• names and titles of the people the traveler will see;
• personal notes about people the traveler may see to aid conversation and
familiarity, including reminders about family members, recent achievements, or
personal interests;
• dates and times of appointments;
• purpose of the appointments;
• software and/or documents required for the appointments.
These details are illustrated in the itinerary in Figure 4.
As soon as the travel and hotel accommodations and the appointments have
been confirmed, you can prepare the final itinerary. Make a step-by-step plan that
is so complete the manager will know where to go, when, and what materials will
be needed by referring to the itinerary.
Preparing an itinerary is time consuming because you need information from
several different sources. Here are a few tips to follow:
• Arrange the papers relating to hotels and appointments in chronological order.
• Give the itinerary an appropriate heading.
• Use the days and dates as the major divisions, and list the entries under each
division in order according to time.
• Check the final itinerary more than once to make sure it is 100 percent correct
and complete.
You should prepare the itinerary in the style your manager prefers. However,
if the travel agent has already prepared a detailed itinerary, instead of rekeying it
to add the appointments, prepare a separate schedule of appointments.
Just prior to departure, when all the details have been finalized, send an
electronic copy of the itinerary to the traveler. Maintain a copy on your computer
as a record.
If a major change in the manager’s itinerary becomes necessary, inform everyone
who has a copy.
Assembling Materials for the Trip
As you make arrangements for the trip, compile a complete list of items your
manager may need during the trip.
• If a laptop computer is one of the items the manager will be taking, make sure
he or she takes a fully charged spare power pack, removable CDs, flash drives,
and current data for en route work.

Making Travel Arrangements
Receiving Special Instructions
Before your manager travels, determine tasks related to any special incoming mail,
expected telephone calls, materials to be sent to meetings your manager cannot
attend, and special responsibilities you must handle in the manager’s absence.
Ask your manager if he or she wants to post an automatic return e-mail mes-
sage. For example, Microsoft® Outlook and other electronic mail systems provide
features to “auto-forward” e-mail (all or specified) to someone else or to activate
the “Out of Office,” which notifies the sender with a predefined message.
DURING THE MANAGER’S ABSENCE
Work while your manager is away at the same pace as you normally work. This is
an excellent opportunity to work on assignments you may have put off.
Managers will use the Internet to access their e-mail while they are away from
the office to keep up with information and work.They may telephone the office reg-
ularly to keep in touch.Be ready to report any significant events,important mail,and
telephone calls. In your notebook, make a summary of what you should discuss. If
the manager keeps in touch with the office through e-mail, you can provide this in-
formation on a daily basis and get your manager’s feedback immediately.
If possible, plan your schedule so you can spend the first day the manager is
back in the office following through on work generated by the trip.
When the manager is away, you have added responsibilities and may need to
allow extra time to handle them. For example, you may be asked to review faxes
to determine if any of the information is urgent and needs to be handled by either
you or the acting manager. Save some time for communicating with the person
who has been designated to act in the manager’s role. Offer your assistance if you
can perform any of these responsibilities.
AFTER THE MANAGER RETURNS
Your activities on your manager’s first day back in the office after a trip will focus
on briefing the manager on what happened during the trip, following up with cor-
respondence, assembling receipts for his or her expense report, and filing materi-
als your manager brings back.
Report the most significant happenings first. Put on your manager’s desk
• correspondence that arrived in your manager’s absence, arranged in folders;
• the summary of important telephone calls that were not left on voice mail.

Review your list of the materials your manager took on the trip that must be
returned to the files. Locate these materials and file them. Also, file materials your
manager acquired during the trip. Copies of materials from the files your manager
took on the trip can be disposed of. First, however, check carefully for notes that
may have been made on them.
Discuss the trip with your manager. Record any problems encountered with
hotels, car rentals, or other arrangement so you may avoid such problems in the
future. Of course, one of the most important responsibilities is to collect receipts
and prepare the travel expense forms.
Travel Expense Voucher
If you are not sure about your company’s policy with regard to travel expenses,
be certain to review the policy to ensure the form is complete and accurate. Com-
pleteness and accuracy are the two necessary ingredients for ensuring a quick re-
turn of funds owed to the traveler.
Refer to Figure 5 for a sample travel expense voucher. Note all expenses must
have the approval of a senior manager. Although these forms vary from company
to company, most require at least the following information:
• date the expenses were incurred;
• location where the expenses were incurred;

It is common practice for organizations to arrange and pay in advance for air
transportation. For convenience, these arrangements are made through the orga-

on the traveler’s travel expense voucher. However, the receipt or copy of the in-
voice may be required to accompany the required travel expense forms.
Remember most claimed expenses must be verified by receipts and must not
exceed costs specified by company policy. These forms are completed by anyone
who has a legitimate company expense. If the travel expense voucher is in elec-
tronic format, you can retrieve the form and key the information. If not, it is ac-
ceptable to submit these documents in handwritten form.

Ethical Issues in Reporting Travel Expense
Employers expect employees to operate in accordance with the highest attainable
standards of ethical business conduct. They also expect employees to take action
against improper conduct by reporting it if they are aware of it.
When an employee demonstrates unethical behavior, it may begin with peer
pressure or a superior’s direct request to violate the company’s code of ethics.
Consider the situation of Emily Jo, who routinely assisted in the preparation of
travel expense reports. What began as a one-time request from her supervisor to
“pad” expenses became a mountain of bogus entries. Once found out, Emily Jo
was terminated.
Although companies have their own policies, there may be gray areas in ex-
pense regulations that often lead employees to “fudge” the numbers in their favor.
What if you were asked to falsify an expense report for your manager? You have
several options: (1) Inform your manager you feel it is wrong to inflate the num-
bers and ask for his or her support in your decision; (2) before you do anything,
report the request to your ethics officer or a human resources representative;
(3) honor the request but inform your superior you will not do it again; and
(4) comply with your manager’s request.

Culture and International Travel
Customs vary widely from one country to another, and understanding and ob-
serving these cultural variables is critical to a traveler’s success. Helping your man-
ager learn something about the culture of a country before doing business there
will enhance the changes of a successful outcome and help him or her develop
prosperous, long-term relationships.
• Research national holidays and important events in the country your manager
will be visiting. Then he or she can show respect for those occasions by honor-
ing customs and restrictions associated with special events and holidays.
• Help your manager learn a few foreign words and phrases such as Hello, How
are you?, Please, Thank you, It was my pleasure to meet you. Books on language
translations of common terms are readily available in bookstores.
• Learn to correctly spell and pronounce the names of his or her hosts and busi-
ness associates.
• Research the local habits and restrictions of countries your manager will be vis-
iting. For example, are you aware that while a gift wrapped in red might be well
received in one location might offend a host in another location? Your manager
will appreciate it if you inform her or him of any pertinent information you
learn in this area.
• Print new business cards. One side should contain the usual information in
English; the reverse side should be printed in the foreign language. Foreign
business contacts will view this as a courteous gesture.
Employees are expected to follow the travel expense policies to ensure honest
and efficient use of company funds. If you prepare travel expense records or
represent or certify the accuracy of information in such records, you must be dili-
gent in ensuring their accuracy and integrity.

1. Identify types of services and
resources needed to make
domestic and international
travel arrangements.
Services and resources include the following:
•
organization’s policies regarding travel expenses;
•
favorite Web sites;
•
travel agency contact information;
•
information about manager’s preferences toward air travel, hotel
accommodations, and car rentals;
•
Official Airline Guide (OAG);
•
visa requirements;
•
international travel tips.
2. Prepare for a business trip.
To be successful in planning a trip for your manager, you must:
•
ask questions about policies and procedures within the organization.
•
determine preferences for air, hotel, and car accommodations.
3. Make air and hotel
reservations.
Gather the necessary details on the following:
•
date of departure and return;
•
date and time of first business appointment;
•
preferred time for travel;
•
hotel preference;
•
car rental.
4. Make special arrangements
for international travel.
To arrange for international travel, you must accommodate for your manager’s
jet lag because it can result in fatigue and irritability. In addition, you must be
well informed about visa requirements for the country to be visited. Understand
the twenty-four-hour clock and its effect when you are trying to contact your
manager. Furthermore, you might suggest a different business card be printed to
include the language of the country to be visited. Remember to include your
research on the country’s business culture and customs.
5. Develop an overall trip plan
that includes details to be
handled before a trip, during
a trip, and at the conclusion
of a trip.
Refer to the trip-planning checklist for details to be addressed before your man-
ager travels, while your manager is away, and when your manager returns
home.
6. Identify ethical issues in
reporting travel expenses.
Ethical issues include your manager “padding” his or her travel expenses or
your manager asking you to pad the expenses.
7. Discuss the importance of
understanding cultural
differences as they relate to
your manager’s travel.
Customs vary widely from one country to another, and understanding and
observing these cultural variables is critical to a traveler’s success.

asked you to make travel arrangements for the same
time that the other two executives are traveling. You
call the airline. A seat is not available at that time.
What should you do while you are talking with the
reservations clerk?
4. Preventive measures. This was the first time you
made travel arrangements for your manager, and
your manager had the following problems on his
trip. How would you prevent these problems from
reoccurring on the next trip?
a. The hotel room was guaranteed for arrival,
but a nonsmoking room was not requested.
Because of a large convention being held at
the hotel, your manager could not get a
nonsmoking room when he arrived.
b. Although you told your manager a car had been
rented, the rental agency did not have a
reservation. Your manager could not rent his
preferred car size.
c. A schedule of appointments was not included in
the travel file given to your manager.
5. Ethical dilemma. In your team, respond to the fol-
lowing: Expense “padding” is the same as thievery.
Is participating in this behavior the same as stealing?
Why or why not? If time is allowed, share your re-
sponses with other teams in your class.

appear in a logical order. To avoid using modifiers incor-
rectly, add an element that will clarify the meaning of the
sentence or place the modifier close to the word it is in-

Planning Meetings and Conferences
A
s an office professional, you may be responsible for arranging a wide vari-
ety of meetings, from small informal meetings to large conferences. These
may be conducted face-to-face in a boardroom or remotely, using virtual
conferencing. In addition, you may also have to participate during the meeting,
making valuable contributions to the decision-making process. Depending on the
formality, you may be responsible for any or all of the following:
• arranging the date and time;
• reserving the meeting room;
• sending notices;
• preparing the agenda;
• planning for supplies, equipment, and software;
• planning food and refreshments;
• assembling materials;
• attending the meeting;
• handling telephone interruptions;
• recording the meeting;
• following up after the meeting;
• preparing and correcting meeting notes or minutes.
Suppose you are headed into a meeting you have been responsible for planning
and someone hands you a note saying the caterer will be late delivering the re-
freshments for the next break time. Suppose the projector’s bulb burns out and
everyone looks to you for the extra bulb because you had the responsibility for
handling media. Regardless of how well you have planned the arrangements for a
meeting, difficult situations (and embarrassing ones) can and do occur. Judgments
are made about your organizational skills based on how you handle meeting
arrangements. These judgments reflect conscious evaluations of your abilities,
skills, and potential for advancement within a company. In fact, how you handle
yourself, how well you plan the arrangements, and how you work with others
sends a message about your professionalism.
The task of planning meetings gives you one of the very best opportunities to
make your manager look good and to secure your relationship as a team member.
The guidelines presented in this chapter will help ensure you are successful in
organizing and coordinating meetings.
Before the Meeting
There are numerous meeting arrangements to make and different options avail-
able to help you get organized. Before you begin, be certain you fully understand
your responsibilities for making the meeting or conference arrangements. Begin by
clarifying your responsibilities toward planning meetings to help prevent any mis-
understandings later.
CREATING AN ACTION CHECKLIST
How will you ensure that you remember all the necessary steps and that you are or-
ganized? It is best to work from an action checklist. You may require more
than one checklist if you have a lot of responsibilities for the meeting or conference.
470

Planning Meetings and Conferences
The following checklist is a guide.You will need to customize your own list for your
own purposes.
The following items should be completed in ample time:
1. Find a common date and time when key members can attend.
2. Reserve the meeting room.
3. Make and confirm hotel accommodations and transportation available to and
from the meeting, if necessary, for any out-of-town participants, or provide
participants with several hotel and car-rental options so they can make their
own reservations.
4. Get a written confirmation or a confirmation number of all reservations.
5. Determine how the meeting will be announced. You may or may not be re-
sponsible for this task if a meeting or conference is to be held in a location
other than your company. For a meeting held on the company’s premises, this
task is usually the office professional’s responsibility. You will also need to
keep track of responses to the announcement and follow up with reminders.
6. Determine audiovisual or any other special equipment needs. If this meeting
is a formal conference where speakers or presenters are involved, ask each
speaker or presenter for a written request for his or her audiovisual needs.
7. Order or lease audiovisual equipment.
8. Confirm attendance at least twenty-four hours prior to the meeting to con-
firm food order (if ordering food) or to be able to reproduce copies of docu-
ments for distribution.
A sample checklist for an in-house meeting is shown in Figure 1. The checklist
includes items to complete (1) before a meeting, (2) on the meeting day, and (3) af-
ter the meeting. This list can be kept on your computer, or you may want to work
from a hard copy. Either way, plan in advance and check and double-check your
list.
Using the Computer to Schedule a Meeting
How you handle the tasks before a meeting depends on staff and space availabil-
ity and the preferred method of communicating meeting plans. Arranging an in-
house meeting is easy when the following conditions exist:
• The managers in your organization use the computer to keep their calendars.
• Both scheduled time and free time can be accessed.
• The calendars are not classified as private and, therefore, are available to others.
• The managers use electronic mailboxes.
• The conference rooms are scheduled using the computer.
When shared electronic calendars are used, you would follow these steps:
1. Check the availability of the facilities.
2. Review the calendars of those who are to attend the meeting.
3. Find a time when all the participants are available.
4. Schedule the meeting and send the information about the meeting to the
participants’ electronic mailboxes.
5. Send reminders via the e-mail system.

Using the Telephone to Schedule a Meeting
If you and others do not use the computer for planning tasks, then you must make
meeting arrangements using traditional methods. Using the telephone to find a room
for an in-house meeting and a time when it is convenient for all the participants to meet
can become a time-consuming task, so plan ahead when you are using this method.

FIGURE 2 • A form for scheduling meetings.
At the time your manager asks you to schedule an in-house meeting or to find
when the other managers are available, he or she should give you at least first and
second choices of meeting dates and times and tell you the purpose of the meeting.
Enter the meeting for both date and time choices in your manager’s appointment
calendar. Contact the other participants and request the meeting for your manager’s
first choice.Also, inquire whether each person could be available at the second time
selected. By doing this, you already will have the information if some of the partic-
ipants have a conflict and the meeting has to be scheduled for the time of the sec-
ond choice. Scheduling a meeting of three or four people can become complicated,
involving many telephone calls or e-mail messages, because executives and profes-
sionals make numerous appointments, and some of them may travel. Consequently,
let the participants or their assistants know you will respond immediately if you
cannot arrange the meeting as tentatively scheduled. As soon as you schedule the
meeting, enter the date and time as a firm commitment in your manager’s calendar
and yours; clear the calendar of the extra or alternate meeting time.
Using a Schedule Form to Schedule a Meeting
If you have any difficulty setting up a meeting with other managers at your com-
pany’s facilities because of telephone tag or find some participants are traveling,
consider using a schedule form similar to the one shown in Figure 2. Certain times
which were not available for meetings have been blocked out on this form. The

Another use of this form is to fill in the time participants are requesting as they
call in or send their response by e-mail. If your manager has given you his or her
first and second choices, then block out all other times and fill in only the re-
sponses from the participants.
Make sure you discuss your options with your manager before making
arrangements.
RESERVING A MEETING ROOM
The type of meeting or conference room you will need depends on the purpose of
the meeting, the size and needs of the group, and the necessary equipment. For in-
stance, a specially equipped room is needed for a video teleconference.You can de-
termine the size of the room needed by checking the participant list. If minutes
were kept for a formal meeting or conference held in the past, then you can check
the previous minutes to get an estimate of attendance. Also, confer with your man-
ager about facilities needed. For an off-site meeting, your manager may ask you to
reserve a conference room at a hotel near the airport from which most participants
will be arriving and leaving. You should confirm the approximate number of par-
ticipants so the hotel’s meeting facilitator can reserve an appropriate-sized room.
Hotels provide information online about their services. Some of the services pro-
vided by major hotels are
• equipment rental;
• meeting services that coordinate audiovisual services for associations, conven-
tions, and corporate meetings;
• banquet and meeting rooms;
• room setup and equipment specifications;
• on-site supervision and labor coordination;
• exhibitor services—a department dedicated to the special requirements of
exhibitors;
• business centers that provide services such as fax transmission, photocopies,
computer workstations with Internet connections and office equipment rental,
off-site printing and binding, color copies, and office supplies for purchase.
If you must schedule a luncheon or dinner meeting at a hotel or a restaurant,
call the banquet manager or the sales/catering manager. Inquire about any costs in
addition to the cost of the meal plus gratuity. You may have to guarantee a mini-
mum number of attendees to avoid additional costs. On the other hand, if you are
asking a hotel or a restaurant for a meeting room only, establish what the cost of
the room will be before you work out other details.
474

Planning Meetings and Conferences
FIGURE 3 • A conference room at the headquarters of a major corporation.
Frequently room reservations at locations other than your company’s facilities
are made well in advance of a meeting date. Therefore, at the time you make the
reservation, enter a notation in your calendar reminding you when to prepare and
send out notices. You can enter the reminders at one time for a full year if you are
to prepare and send notices for a group whose meetings are regularly scheduled a
year in advance. Be alert to any changes in meeting dates and indicate them in your
reminder system. You also need a reminder to check the room reservation several
days before the meeting (or if appropriate, several weeks).
As you make arrangements for meeting facilities, keep in mind the effect of the
room and its furnishings. The atmosphere of the room will contribute significantly
to an effective meeting. If the participants are distracted because they are physically
uncomfortable, it will detract from the success of the meeting. See Figure 3 for an
example of an attractive, comfortable meeting room.
Here are some questions to ask when arranging for a room:
• Do the room and its furnishings contribute to an effective meeting?
• Will the participants remain in the same room for refreshment or lunch breaks
and, if so, is the room large enough to accommodate serving a meal?
• Will the participants need to break out into smaller rooms at any time?
• Does the arrangement of the room meet the purpose of the meeting? For ex-
ample, if the purpose of the meeting is to resolve problem-solving situations,
then a U-shaped or semicircular furniture arrangement would be most appro-
priate. On the other hand, if the participants are to review recommendations,
then a circular or rectangular arrangement works best.
• Is the room large enough to comfortably accommodate the participants and any
planned audiovisual aids?
• Will there be a guest speaker? Does the speaker have special requirements for
the room?
• What type of media equipment is in the room and is there an audio/video
department at the location to assist in case of problems?
• Is the room free from obstructions such as posts or distractions and interruptions
such as telephones and loud noises?
• Is there adequate lighting, heating, and ventilation?

SENDING NOTICES
Business professionals are busy people, so it is important to announce meetings as
soon as possible. Most participants have heavy schedules and prefer plenty of advance
notice.
The type of notice, timing, and details to be included are decisions you must
make, depending on the type of meeting and how far in advance planning occurs.
For routine meetings you may use your e-mail system to post notes of upcoming
meetings, or you may create a form announcement. More formal meetings require
drafting a notice for the specific occasion. Microsoft® has several attractive tem-
plates you can use to create your meeting announcements to save time. If these are
not available on your computer, you may download them from the Microsoft®
Web site.
As soon as you have established a date, time, and venue, send the notices by
e-mail. Figure 4 provides an example of a meeting notice.
When composing notices, always specify
• time;
• date;
• location;
• deadline for accepting agenda items;
• action to take if member will attend;
• action to take if member cannot attend.
Participants for a meeting are usually asked to submit topics for the agenda.
Requests for items should be made early enough to prepare a final agenda based
on the replies received. Clearly state the deadline for the latest time you will accept
agenda items.
Time and Type of Notice
Determine the best time to send the notices. Consider also that often notices sent too
early are ineffective because they can be forgotten.The amount of lead time for send-
ing notices varies according to the formality of the meetings. For example, suppose
it is now 10 a.m. and your manager asks you to set up a small informal meeting this
afternoon at 2:30 p.m. with five other managers. Obviously, you do not have much
lead time to send notices to the participants.What are your options? You may notify
everyone using the e-mail system or telephone. In today’s electronic world, e-mail is
often solely used for all messages—replacing the routed memo entirely.
Some announcements for formal meetings and conferences may be sent to par-
ticipants as far as one to three months in advance. These announcements may be

in the form of specially designed brochures with registration forms, formal letter-
head invitations, or printed forms.
For some types of meetings or conferences, enclose an addressed return card
with the notice to make it easy for the recipients to reply. If you are not using 
e-mail to send the notice, add to the file copy the date the notice was mailed.
Details in Notice
Use who, what, when, how long, where, and why as guides for composing notices.
Be explicit about when: state the day, date, and hour. Include anything else in the
notice that is essential. For instance, if you have a preliminary agenda, enclose it.
If the participants need to bring along materials, mention this request in the notice.

PREPARING THE AGENDA
Whether your manager is conducting an informal meeting or acting as chairper-
son of a more formal meeting or conference, he or she needs to follow a prepared
agenda that has been provided to participants. An agenda, also called an order of
business, is a list of topics to be covered during a meeting or conference, arranged
in the order in which the topics will be discussed (Figure 5). Preparing the agenda
usually means you keyboard, copy, and distribute the agenda. Should your man-
ager ask participants to submit topics for the agenda, the request should be made
enough in advance to allow time for receiving the replies before preparing the fi-
nal agenda.
If you are responsible for preparing the agenda, key it and send it as an 
e-mail attachment. Even for an informal meeting, an agenda should be distrib-
uted to all the members. Send the agenda early enough that each member
receives it several days before the meeting. They will need time to prepare for
the meeting. The more prepared the members are, the more productive the
meeting.
CHOOSING A MEETING FORMAT
When the group has not already established the order of business, you can use the
following two samples as guidelines.
Formal Meeting
1. Call to order by presiding officer.
2. Roll call—either oral or checked by the secretary or have a check-in sheet (see
Figure 6).
3. Approval, amendment, or correction of minutes of previous meeting.
4. Reading of correspondence.
5. Reports (in this order):
• Officers
• Standing committees
• Special committees
6. Unfinished business from previous meetings.
7. New business.
8. Appointment of committee.
9. Nomination and election of officers—once a year.
10. Announcements, including the date of the next meeting.
11. Adjournment.
How to Prepare an Agenda
✓Include the names of all participants.
✓Include the date, time, and place.
✓Include the topics of issues.
✓Indicate the level of action, if requested, to be taken by the par-
ticipants for each topic or issue:discuss,decide,or recommend.
✓Include time limits, if requested, for each topic or issue.

ASSEMBLING MATERIALS
As soon as a meeting date has been set, start assembling the necessary materials. Just
prior to the meeting, arrange them in a folder in the order in which your manager
will refer to them. In addition to the agenda, materials that may be needed include
• extra copies of the agenda;
• an up-to-date participant list;
• minutes of the previous meeting;
• a list of standing and special committees;
480

Planning Meetings and Conferences
• a list of action items not yet completed by members;
• letters, memorandums, and reports related to the agenda items;
• copies of materials your manager has prepared for distribution;
• materials available from others directly related to the topics or issues to be
considered;
• meeting check-in sheet for large conferences to assist with future mailings and
to know who attended (include participants’ name, title, company, phone, fax,
and e-mail address; see Figure 6).
You should consider what supportive materials might be called for during the
meeting. Assemble them, but if the meeting is in your manager’s office, keep them
on your desk. If you attend the meeting, take the folder of supportive materials
with you; however, do not put these papers in with the other materials your man-
ager will take to the meeting. Having to shuffle extra papers not only would dis-
rupt your manager’s thoughts but also would distract the group.
If the meeting is out of town, put the supportive materials in folders, carefully
labeled so your manager can quickly find the papers. As a precaution, never put
your file copies with materials to be carried around. Make copies and leave the
originals in the files.
PLANNING FOR SUPPLIES, EQUIPMENT, AND SOFTWARE
The list of meeting supplies and equipment will be different for every meeting.
How many supplies and the type of equipment necessary will depend on the type
of meeting, the style of presentation to be given, and the guests who have been
invited. The following is a general checklist for any meeting:
• Notebook computer for presentation hook up or for note taking;
• Computer presentations stored on hard drive and removable media as a backup;
• Professional presentation software, such as Microsoft® PowerPoint or Corel
Presentations™, loaded on the hard drive;
• Ceiling-mounted multimedia projector;
• Laser pointer for presentation;
• Projection screen;
• DVD player;
• Remote control for DVD player or computer;
• Overhead projector;
• Transparency sheets for overhead projector;
• Spare bulb for overhead projector;
• Colored markers for overhead transparencies;
• Flip chart tripod or support for paper block;
• Flip chart paper;
• Adhesive tape or putty to suspend flip chart paper around the room;
• Strip covers or tape to secure or cover electrical cords on floor;
• Colored markers for flip chart paper;
• Name tents or tags, and a marker to write the names;
• Scissors;
• Whiteboard markers and erasers;
481

Planning Meetings and Conferences
• Writing block for each participant;
• Writing pen or pencil for each participant;
• Telephone message pad and pen next to meeting room telephone;
• Promotional items such as lapel pins, key tags, or pens with company logo;
• Enough chairs for all participants.
PLANNING REFRESHMENTS AND FOOD
If your manager asks you to order refreshments and meals for participants, be sure
to confirm the number of participants with the catering staff. A critical concern
should be that before deciding on the type of food served, consider the dietary con-
cerns of individuals who prefer certain types of food such as vegetarians and peo-
ple observing religious conventions or medical restrictions. North Americans are,
in general, health conscious. Keep this in mind when arranging the menu. Keep in
mind the following guidelines for ordering:
Beverages
1. Most participants enjoy coffee and tea regardless of the hour. Supply some de-
caffeinated coffee and herbal teas for those who cannot tolerate caffeine.
2. Juices are popular at morning meetings. Supply both sweetened and unsweet-
ened juices. Many people avoid excess sugar intake.
3. Bottled mineral water is appreciated at both morning and afternoon meet-
ings. In this case, smaller is better. Larger bottles are awkward to handle and
inappropriate.
4. The key is to provide some variety. At the very minimum, provide coffee and
juices for any of the meeting breaks. At each break, you can expect that par-
ticipants will consume one or two beverages.
5. Ensure that fresh water, chilled or with ice, and glasses are available through-
out the meeting.
Food
1. Some participants will have special-needs diets (such as no meat, low calorie,
low sugar, or low cholesterol). Don’t wait for a participant to identify this
ahead of time. Plan enough variety to accommodate differences.
2. Never make pork the only food option. For religious reasons, many people do
not eat any form of pork.
3. Participants enjoy fruit and muffins for morning breaks (see Figure 7).
4. Order food in small, manageable pieces. People generally converse during
breaks, and most find that small sandwiches or fruit sections are easiest to
handle.
5. If you want the participants to maintain a high level of energy, stay away from
heavy desserts or starchy foods.
HANDLING LAST-MINUTE DETAILS
Someone once said, “We don’t plan to fail, we just fail to plan.” So plan—and be
prepared to make changes. Remain flexible. Prior to the meeting or conference,
conduct a last-minute check of all details.At this point, a checklist serves as a valu-
able tool in the planning process. Refer to the sample checklist in Figure 1.

During the Meeting
Whether or not you are required to attend meetings with your manager will de-
pend on the type of organization you work for, your manager’s preferences, and
the purpose of the meeting. In many instances you may be asked to participate in
the meeting, and your role may many times involve taking the meeting notes or
recording the meeting proceedings. If you are asked to attend a meeting, arrange
for someone to answer your telephone. Do not encourage interruptions, except for
the most urgent calls.
TAKING NOTES
Before you take notes of any meeting, clarify the extent to which you are to take
notes. For instance, in an informal meeting, you are not expected to record the en-
tire conversation verbatim (word for word).
Note taking usually is necessary near the end of a conversation when the
participants are summarizing.When you think you have recorded all the essential in-
formation, you may read it to the participants, thus checking your notes and perhaps

483

reminding them of something to add. After the meeting, your manager may use the
notes to prepare a recommendation, such as a change in procedure or a request for
new equipment. A popular way of taking notes today is to use a laptop computer.
Regardless of the method, after the meeting you can prepare a draft of your notes
that will be meaningful to your manager.
RECORDING MINUTES
As an administrative assistant, you may be assigned the task of recording minutes
and transcribing them. Minutes are notes recorded for a more formal meeting, such
as for a meeting of officers of a corporation. Minutes serve as a record an official
meeting was held, discussions took place, and decisions were made during the meet-
ing. Different methods are used for recording minutes, including using a notebook
computer or a notebook to take minutes during the meeting or using computer soft-
ware that provides an audio record that can later be transcribed into minutes.
Using a Notebook Computer
Computers are gaining increased popularity for the handling of information at all
stages of the recording process. Most meetings do not require a verbatim transcript
of the minutes. When using a computer, the best practice is to key notes onto a
notebook computer during the meeting (Figure 8). Your job of transcribing your
notes will be mostly completed when you leave the meeting. All that will be re-
quired is some reformatting and editing.
During the meeting, your computer can be used for more than recording notes.
It may operate independently but may also be connected online to the office net-
work. The online connection allows access to information that may be needed to
make informed decisions during the meeting.
Using a Notebook
You may decide your primary way to take minutes is to use a notebook. Your task
is similar in meetings conducted formally to those held informally. You are not ex-
pected to prepare a verbatim transcript. Only motions and a few other items must
be recorded verbatim. Your task is to record the essential information that will
serve as a basis for writing the minutes. Minutes provide a record of all the action
taken during the meeting, not a detailed review of what was said; consequently,
Igor Mojzes-Fotolia
484

Planning Meetings and Conferences
record all action and everything else that seems important. When you are record-
ing information for the minutes, you need to take essential notes. For instance,
when a chairperson recognizes a speaker, the chairperson does not always call the
speaker’s name. Likewise, a chairperson does not always restate a motion as the
vote is taking place. When members are following distributed materials, reading as
the discussion ensues, the section to which the speaker is referring is not always
clearly designated. Be sure to add any additional information that will clarify who
said what and what was read.
Record the time, date, and place of the meeting; attendance; reference to
corrections and additions to the minutes; who is speaking to introduce reports
and make motions; paragraph and page references to distributed materials be-
ing discussed; the exact statement of each motion if the chairperson does not
state it; who volunteers for follow-up work; time of adjournment; and any-
thing else that will be helpful to you in preparing the minutes. If you indicate
in your notebook each time a motion is made, you can organize the minutes
quickly.
Using Computer Software
When participants are in various locations which could require expensive travel to
attend, a cost-saving or a time-saving alternative is to use computer software such
as Wimba to digitally record the meeting. The participants view and participate in
the meeting via their computers at their location rather than traveling. Wimba is
just one of several software programs which provides interaction between partici-
pants just as if they were face-to-face. The software broadcasts the meeting which
can then be archived as a permanent record.A hard copy of the minutes can be cre-
ated by viewing the meeting.
Meetings held via computer are called virtual meetings. You will learn more
about virtual meetings later in this chapter.
Using a Tape Recorder
No matter if you use a computer, a notebook, or software such as Wimba to record
minutes, a tape recorder is still often used as a backup to obtain a verbatim record
of a meeting for the purpose of (1) preparing a verbatim transcript, (2) assisting
the secretary in writing the minutes, and (3) securing a record of discussions on
controversial topics.
Determine the policy for keeping tapes. Keep each tape until the minutes have
been approved or for a much longer period when the topics are controversial or
can become controversial. Some groups keep the minutes tapes permanently. Keep
a tape until you have approval to erase it.

Tips for Successful Note Taking
• Prior to the meeting, study the minutes of similar meetings to
become familiar with the form used.
• Prior to the meeting, create a template with as much
information as possible. During the meeting, have the template
on the screen of your notebook computer where you can add
information as the meeting progresses.
• Sit near the chairperson so you can assist each other.
• Ask the chairperson to see you get a copy of all materials read
or discussed. These materials are part of the record and
should be attached to the minutes. Do not wait until the end of
the meeting to collect them.
• Arrange a signal, such as slightly raising your hand, with the
chairperson to let him or her know you need assistance in
getting statements that must be transcribed verbatim.
• Before the meeting begins, record the name of the group and
the date, time, and place of the meeting.
• At the meeting record the names of those attending and those
absent. Using a list of participants you prepared in advance,
place a check mark in the appropriate column to indicate
attendance and absence.
• Write the exact words of anyone who asks his or her view be
made part of the record.
• Be alert during the informal discussion about the details of a
topic. Record each detail as it is discussed. After a detail is
agreed on, and this usually is not by vote, write a word such
as Agreed or Yes by it. Each of these items must be followed
up. For information that is not needed but should be kept until
you transcribe, you can use the “Strikethrough Formatting”
command. If using Microsoft® Word 2007, to use the
strikethrough formatting command
• Select the text not needed;
• Click on the Home tab;
• Click on the Dialog Box Launcher in the Font Group to open
the Font dialog box;
• Click Font, making sure the Font tab displays;
• Click on the Strikethrough box under Effects;
• Click on OK.
This will place a diagonal line across suggestions made but not
accepted if you have entered them in your notes.
• Indicate in your notes the name of each person making a motion.
• Be sure to take detailed notes on any obligations your
manager assumes during the meeting.
• While a committee is being appointed, write the name of the
committee and the full names of its members, and identify
who accepted the position of chairperson.
• When officers are elected, record the names of all the officers,
incumbent as well as new, and their respective offices.
• Make notes on the place, date, and time of the next meeting.
• Write down the time of adjournment.
• As soon as the meeting adjourns, verify any points about
which you have doubts. You may need to ask about a person’s
title, the full name of a product or place, the correctness of
technical terms with which you are not familiar, or any small
details you need to prepare complete minutes.
Meeting Follow-Up
Numerous details must be taken care of immediately after a meeting has been held.
Prepare a to-do list of all the actions you need to take. Here are some items that
might be included:
1. Check the room for orderliness. Pick up extra copies of agendas, proposals,
and reports left in the room. Also, check the room for any articles left by
the participants and clear away any leftover food and beverages or call the
appropriate service department.
2. Make any necessary follow-up entries in the appointment calendars.
3. Send materials through e-mail to people who were absent.
4. Prepare a list to remind your manager of his or her obligations resulting from
the meeting.
5. Put a copy of everything—agenda, reports, and so on—in a folder to use as
reference at a later date. Be sure to include in your folder any summaries re-
sulting from taking notes during the meeting.
486

Planning Meetings and Conferences
6. Handle any requests that may have resulted from the meeting.
7. See that the audiovisual equipment is returned.
8. Enter the date and time of the next meeting in the calendars.
9. Complete the minutes.
10. Reserve the room and equipment for the next meeting.
To ensure there is clear understanding of what was agreed upon and to provide a
complete record of transactions, the chairperson should write a memo to all
members involved in follow-up actions. The chairperson should also send letters
of congratulations to newly elected officers—even if these members were present
at the meeting.
PREPARING NOTES
If you took notes, follow these general guidelines to produce the draft:
1. Produce the draft while the discussions are still fresh in your mind.
2. If an agenda was used, follow the sequence of topics or issues shown.
3. Prepare a concise summary in paragraph form with centered or side headings.
Include the date, place of meeting, and the names of the participants. Keyboard
the notes in summary form, as shown in Figure 9.
PREPARING MINUTES
Key the minutes immediately following the meeting. Ask questions while the
meeting is fresh in your and your manager’s mind. If you recorded the minutes
of the meeting, you will be able to organize the motions and amendments
and summarize the discussion much faster if you do these things soon after the
meeting.
Before you prepare a final version, key a rough draft of the minutes, double-
spaced, and submit it to your manager for approval. This will allow him time to
make changes he or she sees as necessary and discuss them with you.
Your purpose in preparing the minutes is to
• include all the essential information as a record that will be meaningful to oth-
ers in the future;
• make it easy for the reader to locate information.
Refer to Figure 9 for a sample of meeting minutes.
INFORMAL MEETING MINUTES
When a meeting has been conducted informally, there will be no motions and no
voting. Instead, agreement may be made by consent. In this case, include essential
facts in the minutes. For an informal meeting include
• the purpose of the meeting;
• date and time;
• location;
• who attended and who was absent;
• summary of discussion and decisions;
• summary of the follow-up.

July 10, 20XX
The ideas presented at the June 10 meeting for cutting administrative
costs were revised and the following decisions were made:
Travel. Effective August 1, 20XX, all executives of Continental Technology
will no longer travel executive class; economy fare only will be paid by
the company, with the exception of executive class fares approved by
the vice president. Where Continental executives are taking major clients
on business trips, the executive class will automatically be approved by
the vice president.
Sales Incentive Trips. The consensus was that the yearly sales incentive
trips, given to sales executives reaching their quotas, should be shortened
in length. The trips will be shortened from one week to four days. As well,
these trips will no longer be to extremely distant points; they will now be to

Planning Meetings and Conferences
FORMAL MEETING MINUTES
For formal meetings, use the following as a guide:
1. Either single- or double-space the minutes.
2. In all capital letters, key a heading that fully identifies the meeting: MINUTES
OF THE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE, BUSINESS & SCI-
ENCES DIVISION. Key the date as a subheading a double-space below the
heading. Repeat the date on each page. If the group holds special meetings, the
subheading could read for example: “Special Meeting, October 22, 20XX.”
3. Use the past tense, and write complete sentences. In the opening paragraph,
state the name of the group, where the meeting was held, both the time and
the date, who presided, and whether the meeting was regular or special.When the
meeting was “called” (that is, when it was “special”), add the purpose of the
meeting, since it was called for an express purpose.
4. State whether the minutes of the previous meeting (mention the date) were
“approved as read” or “approved as corrected.” When the minutes are ap-
proved, the word Approved should be written on the minutes with the secre-
tary’s initials and the date.
5. Use side headings or marginal captions to help the reader locate items. The
agenda will be helpful in organizing the minutes.
6. Mention all reports presented by officers, standing committees, and special
committees in the order they were presented, and tell what actions were taken.
Usually a member of a group moves that the report be accepted; when it is,
this action should be reported in the minutes.
7. To make each distributed report a part of the official record, refer to each one
in the appropriate section of the minutes. You could say, “The attached report
on Revised Plans for Scheduling Workshops was distributed by Jason Hartford,
Chairperson of the Committee on Leadership Training.”In the same paragraph,
state who made the motion and the action taken.
8. Key verbatim all reports read orally and treat them as quoted material; that
is, indent five spaces from the left and the right. This way, the format will re-
flect the origin of the material. If a report that was read is lengthy and in a
form that can be copied, you can say, for example, “The report on Online
Training Sessions, presented by Jeanette Olivas, was copied and is attached.”
9. Treat each main motion (and the amendments related to it, if any) as a sepa-
rate item. Be sure to include in the minutes all motions made and how they
were disposed of. State each motion verbatim, along with who made it, that it
was seconded, whether it was adopted or defeated, and the votes cast for and
against it. For some groups, also include the name of the person who seconded
the motion.
10. When a motion has been made from the floor, you can begin the paragraph
by saying,“Geraldine Mohammad moved (not made a motion) that...,” or “It
was moved by Geraldine Mohammad and seconded by Raj Falfer that....”
11. When a motion is amended, give the history of the motion in the minutes.
First, state the motion, who made it, and that it was seconded. Next, take up
the amendments in the same order as they were made. State each amendment
verbatim, who made it, that it was seconded, and the votes cast for and
against it.

12. The debate concerning a motion does not have to be included; nevertheless,
reasons for a decision are often helpful to the current officers and to others in
the future. Therefore, discussion can be included in the minutes. Summarize
the debate in broad, concise terms. Try to include all the main ideas—both
pros and cons—but don’t overload the minutes with who said what.
13. Motions should appear in the minutes in the same order they were taken up
during the meeting. Minutes shift abruptly from one topic to another. Just sep-
arate them with side headings, or triple-space between them when you use
marginal captions.
14. An agenda item that has been taken up but not completed becomes unfinished
business on the agenda of the next meeting; therefore, indicate with some de-
tail any information that will be helpful when this item is taken up again.
15. Group announcements near the end under the heading “Announcements.”
Some of the announcements may have been made at the beginning of the
meeting or during it, but they can be grouped together.
16. Include the time, place, and date of the next meeting, and the time of ad-
journment.
17. Minutes that are to be read aloud are signed by the secretary; minutes that are
to be distributed are signed by both the chairperson and the secretary.
18. Provide a place for the signature and the date of approval such as
Planning Meetings and Conferences
19. Arrange the file copy of the minutes in chronological order. Arrange all at-
tachments in the order they were introduced in the minutes.
CORRECTING MINUTES
Once minutes are signed and distributed to members, some members may request
amendments. These requests usually take place over e-mail immediately after the
minutes have been distributed. If they are not urgent, they wait and take place at
the next meeting.
When minutes have been corrected or amended, the changes should be
recorded in two places:
1. As an insertion in the minutes being corrected.
2. In paragraph form in the new minutes of the meeting during which the
changes were made.
To show corrections and additions in the file copy of the minutes being cor-
rected, add words in longhand and delete by drawing lines through words. You
want the changes to be obvious. Enter the date of the meeting at which the changes
were made.
Minutes that are distributed are usually approved at the start of the next meeting.
However, sometimes the approval of minutes is dispensed with, and then several sets
are approved at a later meeting. The place provided for the date of approval appears
490

Planning Meetings and Conferences
at the end of the minutes. To be able to tell at a glance which minutes have been ap-
proved, write,“Approved”and the date of approval at the top of the first page of the
file copy immediately after the meeting where the minutes were approved.
Team Meetings
The team concept of meetings focuses on equal participation. Each participant’s
input is considered to be as significant as all other participants’ input, from the
maintenance employee to the Chief Executive Officer. The team concept is effec-
tive because each member is empowered to participate regardless of his or her or-
ganizational status.
Teams make decisions at their level of authority. If a decision must be made at
a higher level of authority, the team forwards a recommendation to management.
Because team meetings encourage all participants to express their views, conflict
and team challenges may occur.
PREPARING FOR A TEAM MEETING
A meeting that follows team techniques requires the same preparation as any other
meeting—a convenient time is established, people are invited, and an agenda is
prepared and delivered to participants prior to the meeting (Figure 10).
When team techniques are followed, careful attention is given to issues that
arise even at the preliminary stages. The following techniques will be helpful when
preparing for a team meeting:
• Choosing an appropriate time is important.
• Employees who form the team may be from all levels of the organization.
• All team members carry equal status.
• The prepared agenda may be general because the actual topics to be discussed
should be decided by the team.
SELECTING PARTICIPANTS
Part of the team philosophy is to get input from people who are actually working
within the process. In other words, the people who know the most about a topic
should be at the meeting to discuss it and to make wise recommendations and
decisions about it.

FIGURE 10 • A group team meeting.
Each role in the team is equally important. The following briefly discusses the
roles of team participants:
1. Team leader. The team leader acts as a chairperson, directing the meeting,
moving from one topic to the next, and keeping on schedule.
2. Guidance team. The guidance team should consist of two or more people who
are familiar with the organization. These people usually come from manage-
ment positions; this enables them to provide information other members may
be unaware of and will be helpful when team decisions are made.They should
be people who have the authority to make changes and the authority to put
decisions into practice.
3. Project team members. All members who will take part in the decisions and
vote on issues are considered project team members.
4. Facilitator. The team leader often carries both the roles of team leader and fa-
cilitator. The facilitator’s responsibility is to make the meeting process flow
with ease and produce results.
5. Recorder. The recorder’s task is to prepare minutes. This task is often rotated
among team members so no one team member always has the additional re-
sponsibility of taking notes at each meeting.
STARTING THE MEETING
Here are some suggestions that will make the team meetings productive:
• Maintain the schedule. The team leader starts early, and the meeting begins and
ends as scheduled.
• Warm up. If the team members do not know each other, the team leader should
start the meeting by having all members introduce themselves. This activity is
considered to be the warm-up.
• Check in. Checking in is an opportunity for each team member to express his
or her present state of mind to the whole team. An example is “I’ve had a pro-
ductive day, and I’m ready to participate.”
• Agree on the goals. Once the check-in is complete, the team leader should re-
view the agenda.
• Review the roles of the team. At the first meeting, the team leader should review
the roles of the team leader, guidance team, facilitator, recorder, and project
team members.

• Establish the house rules. These rules are also referred to as the ground rules.
The team should suggest and agree on some general rules before the meeting
progresses. Here are some examples:
• Everyone will be given an equal opportunity to speak.
• Any person wishing to speak must raise his or her hand.
• Criticize only the issue, not the person with the issue.
• Side conversations are not allowed.
• Each person must focus on the speaker.
• Expect unfinished business.
• The meeting will begin and end on schedule.
• Everyone will focus on the topic and will not interrupt the team’s work for
outside reasons.
• No negative body language is allowed.
• The recorder will be given a few minutes to verify information or ask questions.
• Before ending the meeting, the team will establish a meeting date for the next
meeting.
ENDING THE MEETING AND FOLLOW-UP
Just as you learned previously in this chapter, numerous details must be taken care
of immediately after a meeting has been held. Review the list of suggestions given
in that section.
As a follow-up to the meeting, evaluate each meeting to help improve future
meetings. Here are some questions you or the team might answer:
1. Was the purpose of the meeting clear?

3. Was conflict used in a positive way to distinguish between ideas?
4. Did the group insist on what action was to be done, by when, and by whom?
3. List one suggestion that will make a team meeting productive.

Virtual Meetings
Because managers today have a greater span of control—sometimes locally, na-
tionally, and even internationally—they are constantly seeking ways to spend less
time traveling and more time conducting business. Span of control is the number
of people and functions one manager can supervise. The most common types of
virtual meetings are teleconferences, videoconferences, and Web conferences.
493

Planning Meetings and Conferences
Depending on the situation, these virtual meetings can be as effective as or
more effective than face-to-face meetings. Realizing that every minute costs
money, participants are motivated to be organized.
Service providers and technology vendors support their customers with the lat-
est virtual conference tools to ensure the greatest possibility of success. They pro-
vide complimentary training on the virtual meeting service, live help during the
teleconference, or a hotline into their technical support facility.
Before selecting a virtual meeting, spend some time considering you real needs.
If simple communication is all that you require, then a teleconference is the least
complicated and most cost-effective approach. If your virtual meeting requires the
sharing of data or other material, then Web conferencing will meet your needs. If,
however, you require rich visual images such as when interviewing, or coordinat-
ing a critical message from the CEO, then you may be ready to invest the time and
money in a videoconference.
TELECONFERENCES
Placing conference calls by telephone bringing together three or more people when
the participants are located in different geographic areas is called a teleconference.
Using this method to hold conferences saves travel time and costs and at the same
time maintains effective communications. This virtual meeting is the most widely
used teleconferencing tool today; it can be used effectively when there is no need
for video transmission. Teleconference service provided by your local telephone
company can connect dozens of people to the same call. They can involve local,
national, and international calls. Office professionals will often find themselves ar-
ranging or participating in teleconferences.
Many business telephones have a simple conference function that allows the
conference coordinator to dial up participants and put them into the conference
call. This does not require operator assistance. The conference coordinator may
control the teleconference from a touch-tone telephone using commands on the
keypad. There are no additional fees except for the “collective” cost per minute of
the conference.
However, for more complex teleconferencing, the traditional process of con-
tacting your local service provider to reserve a common bridge or dial-in number
for participants is probably the safest method. There are a number of somewhat
inflexible conditions that surround these reserved teleconferences such as a prede-
termined number of lines for participants and a fixed length of conference time
and a charge for the services. To ensure a successful teleconference, always re-
member you are part of a meeting involving many people.
If you are responsible for arranging a conference call, here are some sugges-
tions to follow:
1. Obtain essential information—cities, names, and the date and time of the tele-
phone conference. Pay particular attention to time zone changes.
2. Ask participants to avoid using cell phones or cordless phones because they
are likely to get interference such as static.
3. Remind everyone the use of speakerphones can pick up background noises
and can sometimes cut off parts of their conversation.
When you are a participant, follow these suggestions.
1. If you are a single participant at your location during a teleconference, use a
lightweight headset consisting of earphones and a built-in microphone.
494

Planning Meetings and Conferences
2. As a participant, identify yourself when speaking and direct your questions or
comments to the people by name.
3. Remember comments not specifically directed to an individual will be per-
ceived as intended for the entire group.
4. Speak naturally as you would during any telephone call, but pause for others
to comment.
You are probably familiar with three-way calling on your cell phone. Three-
way calling is setting up a conference call.
VIDEOCONFERENCES
Videoconferences can be an important vehicle for collaborative office communi-
cation. A videoconference allows participants in scattered geographic locations to
see and hear one another on computer or television monitors by way of images
transmitted over special telephone lines or satellite (see Figure 11). Videoconfer-
encing is expensive because it uses numerous pieces of equipment that include
cameras, monitors, microphones, speakers, and PCs.
There are two common methods of videoconferencing. First is the large-scale
public network-based videoconferencing where the provider will broadcast a con-
ference for viewing by members of the public or large audiences. Examples of this
public network-based videoconference might be when executives need to simulta-
neously address all employees in a “live” meeting, when a committee might want
to conduct a remote interview with a potential employee who lives in another
state, or when the company is holding simultaneous employee training sessions in
several cities.
The second type of videoconference is the local- or wide-area-based videocon-
ference, which is more common within companies that are attempting to reduce
travel expenses or are simply optimizing corporate network technology. Two or
more employees can use this form of videoconferencing simply and effectively by
starting a program on their networked workstation. The conference can then be
conducted from the workstation computer.
FIGURE 11 • A videoconference.
apops-Fotolia
495

Planning Meetings and Conferences
Videoconferencing may reduce employee travel costs between 20 to 50 percent
of the normal cost of bringing people together, but it remains the most costly form
of virtual meetings.
Because videoconferences can connect people in many different locations,
participants need special skills to communicate effectively. The following practi-
cal guidelines will help office professionals to improve communications during
videoconferences:
• Familiarize yourself with the videoconference room and its technology before
your first meeting;
• Videoconferences transmitted over telephone line have slight sound delays and
images that may appear choppy. Participants must be careful listeners because
these delays can make communication difficult;
• Introduce yourself at the start of the meeting, and identify whom you are
addressing throughout the conference;
• Be more deliberate or restrained in your gestures because they may seem exag-
gerated when transmitted;
• Be aware of body language, just as you are in a face-to-face meeting;
• Learn to speak directly to the camera, as if it were a person;
• Avoid such distractions as tapping your fingers on the table or laughing too
loudly because these sounds are easily picked up by the microphone;
• Do not speak to another participant at your location unless you have muted the
microphone;
• Avoid quick response answers, and attempt to speak only when the chair
recognizes you;
• Prepare and rehearse anticipated questions by other participants;
• Prepare visual aids using large print sizes with individual letters and bold simple
drawings that contain only essentials;
• Consider your visual appearance including clothing, grooming, cosmetics,
poise, and physical position;
• Wear light-colored clothing to improve your visibility.
It is very popular for people to hold meetings through their computers, just
using their screens and keyboards. By downloading software from the Internet,
participants can engage in real-time keyed conversations. Audio and video options
are available as long as the participants have the right multimedia software, a
computer, microphone, and speaker, and a simple Web camera placed near the
screen. Today most laptop computers come with a built-in microphone, speakers,
and camera; however, this equipment also can be purchased inexpensively. The
cost is minimal, the procedure is simple, and the result is highly effective.
WEB CONFERENCES
A Web conference or Web meeting occurs when organizations conduct conferences
or meetings through computer terminals using Web conferencing services over the
Internet. Web conferencing delivers the real-time meeting quality of an audio and
video conference without the costs of using a special dedicated room that requires
specialized equipment and training.Web conferencing services that enable this real-
time conferencing offer text chat, audio, video, document sharing, whiteboards,
and presentations. They target large organizations that want to achieve significant
cost savings by reducing travel and meeting costs.
496

Planning Meetings and Conferences
So you will better understand how a Web conference is handled, let’s assume you
read on the Internet about a one-hour Microsoft® Excel training seminar to be held
online through a Web conference and would like to attend.You go to the designated
Web site, view all the possible times the conference is available, and select a session
convenient for you to attend. Registration is required. Some training conferences are
free and others charge a fee, which you may pay by credit card online. Prior to the
meeting time, you will be sent an e-mail outlining the procedures to attend. To at-
tend you go to the Web site and log on using a username and password given to you
in the e-mail much as you would log on to a chat room. Once you are logged on,
you dial a telephone number on your phone to hear the audio portion. Speaker-
phones are recommended. You view the training session on your computer screen
and hear the instructor who brings up Excel on the screen explaining as he or she
moves the cursor around. Questions are either allowed in real time over your tele-
phone during the training session or a question-and-answer session is set up after
the presentation. To end the session, you exit the Web site and hang up your phone.
You can set up a Web conference by using your PC and Web conferencing ap-
plication software, often found in your Web browser, and establish an inexpensive
and reliable way to share information, software applications, PowerPoint presen-
tations, or anything running on your PC with others in online meetings. Add to the
meeting a conference call and you can enhance Web conferencing and encourage
those without the benefit of a PC to participate.
Among the advantages of Web conferencing services are
• no need for an expensive dedicated room, equipment, training, or software;
• unlimited number of meetings for a fee;
• unlimited number of participants;
• unlimited meeting duration;
• meeting from any PC;
• password protection so it is secure and firewall friendly.

Ethical Behavior in Meetings
Ethics is a system of deciding what is right, or more right, in a given situation. You
may find yourself in situations where you might not want to tell the truth to avoid
hurting someone’s feelings. For instance, what if you were a new participant in a
team meeting and after the meeting the facilitator asks you if you enjoyed the
meeting and learned a lot of helpful information when you were really bored and
already knew everything discussed. It is wrong to say,“Oh, yes, I really enjoyed the

International Conferences
As global communications become more commonplace, the office professional
may find it necessary to help the manager prepare an international meeting or con-
ference (Figure 12) or participate in one. You may be required to manage all as-
pects of the meeting, including
• advertising;
• scheduling;
• soliciting papers;
• making announcements;
• serving as liaison and providing protocol;
• supervising staff members;
• selecting and negotiating a major hotel, which would involve obtaining infor-
mation about
• conference rooms;
• exhibit and display space;
• banquets;
• meals;
• tours of areas of interest to attendees and spouses;
• registration;
• audiovisual equipment;
meeting” to avoid hurting the facilitator’s feelings. It would be an outright lie. You
may want to learn to sidestep a question or issue without being brutally honest
when it is simply a matter of avoiding hurting someone’s feelings. Your response
to the facilitator could be “I really did find several points you made interesting and
helpful.”
What if, however, the situation has damaging consequences? For instance
while attending your manager’s presentation, you notice certain figures in the sales
report have been changed to report higher sales. After the meeting you question
him about it, and he tells you he increased the figures because the department is
under pressure to increase sales. If you do not report this behavior and he does it
again, he can say you helped him change the figures because you did not report it
the first time you noticed it. You have the responsibility to do the right thing based
on your own values, and you should report any unethical behavior from the be-
ginning. By doing so, you will be following your company’s code of ethics.
Following ethical behavior in meetings, as well as in any personal interaction,
is using choices that will build positive qualities—trust and credibility.

• on-site administrative support services;
• refreshments breaks;
• tracking and handling finances and payments, including exchange rates;
• making travel and lodging arrangements;
• making security arrangements;
• arranging for transportation;
• providing interpreters, if needed;
• arranging business cards, printed in English and the language of the host country.
You might be asked to find information about all of the above while main-
taining the correct protocol, dealing with cultural differences, and dealing with a
different language. Here are some hints:
• Compile a dossier on the host country, including information about its religious
beliefs, social customs, business philosophy, and family structure.
• Learn courtesy greetings in the language of that country. A simple Good morn-
ing, Thank you, and Goodbye in that language at the beginning and end of a
telephone call will make a favorable impression.
• Educate yourself about the geography and transportation systems of the coun-
try so you will be somewhat familiar with distances, terrain, and mode of trans-
portation when discussing meeting locations and time schedules with your
counterpart in the country being visited.
• Gather information on major landmarks and their histories in the host country.
This will enable you to make informed decisions when collaborating with your
counterpart in preparing a schedule of meetings and activities for your manager
during his visit.
• Familiarize yourself with the customary formats of business documents used.
• Learn the name of major political leaders, sports figures, and other celebrities.

Quick Tips
HAVE YOU BLOGGED LATELY?
You learned about blogs in Chapter 6. What is a blog? A blog is a
shortened term for Web log, a Web site that is updated on a
regular basis, structured in reverse chronological order so the
most recent posted information is listed first, typically with a
strong personal perspective. Blogging could be called another
way of meeting online at your convenience.
Companies may use blogs to ask questions of their customers about
changes in products, announcements about new products, requests for
comments or opinions about ideas affecting their business, and so on. If
your company has a blog, you might be asked to monitor the blog and
report to your manager new comments.Visit www.blog.com and browse
the blogs.You will see blogs from businesses to personals.
All of this information will help you know what not to do as well as what to
do. If you think globally, you can give yourself the edge as you are planning or pro-
gressing through your career. Take every opportunity to familiarize yourself with
significant communications and cultural barriers that need to be overcome with
various cultures. One of your best sources is the United States government. You
can get information from the Small Business Administration’s Office of Interna-
tional Trade (www.sba.gov), the U.S. Department of Commerce (www.commerce
.gov), or the U.S. Department of State (www.state.gov).

for a formal or informal meeting. Summarize the
assistant’s responses to the following questions:
a. What are the most critical steps taken when
you first plan a meeting?
b. What methods are used to notify people of an
upcoming meeting?
c. Are you responsible for taking notes or minutes
in meetings? If so, share how you format the
notes or minutes?

pers, or the Internet for articles relating to electronic
conferencing. Summarize the information and be
prepared to report your findings to the class.
3. With the use of audio and video electronic technol-
ogy, public and private educational institutions are
using virtual meetings. Interview a school adminis-
trator who is responsible for or has participated in
virtual meetings in his or her institution. Report your
findings on what technology supports virtual meet-
ings, how questions and answers are handled during
the meeting, and what common problems arise when
planning virtual meetings.

In addition, Ms. Quevedo has asked your team
to gather the following information to help her com-
municate better with the visitors. Prepare this infor-
mation as an informational report.
Here is the information Ms. Quevedo needs for
the information report:
The Country
• In which state of Mexico is Guadalajara located?
• What are the main industries in Guadalajara?
• What are some historical aspects of Guadalajara?
• What are some political aspects of Guadalajara?
• Who are some sports figures from Guadalajara?
Nonverbal Communication
• You may refer to the information gathered in
Application 11-C to complete this section on non-
verbal communication.
• Are there any nonverbal communication patterns
we use that may be interpreted as offensive in their
country?
• Can you anticipate some possible miscommunica-
tion problems? If so, identify a few.
• Can you determine the appropriate speaking dis-
tance between persons from this culture?
Daily Business Life
• Again, you may refer to Application 11-C.
• How should we greet these visitors?
• Determine if gift giving is appropriate for these
visitors. If so, what kind of gift is appropriate?
• What kinds and colors of flowers are appropriate
to use for our meetings?
• How are business meetings conducted in the visi-
tors’ country compared to our own?
• What business etiquette or manners must we
know before these visitors arrive?
Food
• What rules govern dining at our luncheon here at
the company and at a restaurant?
• What kinds of food do these visitors prefer?
2. You are to assume one visitor does not speak English
and you need to arrange for a translator and decide
where he or she will sit during the meetings and the
dinner.
3. Based on your findings from the cross-cultural study,
plan the three events incorporating the following:
a. Tuesday morning meeting: Be versed in introduc-
tions; plan the seating arrangement (your man-
ager; yourself; Henry Pippen and his assistant,
Kirk Lawrence; J. R. Rush; Thomas Strickland;
Sid Levine; Karen Baxter; and the seven visitors
who will be in attendance); identify specific re-
freshments to be served when and where; and
identify a specific flower arrangement for refresh-
ments and where it will be placed.
• Plan a buffet luncheon in the same room.
• Prepare an itinerary for the visitors showing
their meeting times, location, and free time.
• Prepare a handout for the visitors identifying
entertainment in the Rochester area for the
times they are not in meetings.
b. Wednesday luncheon meeting: Plan the seating
arrangement (your manager, yourself, Henry Pip-
pen and his assistant, R. Rush, and the seven visi-
tors). Select a caterer and give the name, the menu,
and the flower arrangement. Decide if the meal
will be served in the meeting room or elsewhere.
Identify all specifics.
c. Thursday dinner meeting: Make the restaurant
reservations (identify restaurant by name and
type of food served), the final count, make
arrangements for travel to and from the hotel to
the restaurant (identify who will transport them),
and plan the seating arrangement (the group will
consist of the seven visitors, the translator, you,
Ms. Quevedo and her husband, and J. R. Rush
and his wife).
4. Key a memo to Ms. Quevedo for the morning meet-
ing, a memo to Ms. Quevedo for the luncheon meet-
ing, and a memo for the dinner meeting. Each memo
is to outline all details. Be prepared as a team to share
your information with the class.

Task 3: Planning an Event 
Plan a Seminar on Customer Service;
Create Speaker’s Biography; Create 
E-mail Messages; Create a Spreadsheet
of Estimated Expenses; Create a Cover
Memo
Ms. Quevedo has as one of her objectives to provide the
staff with training. She has contacted Maria Zamora, a
customer service consultant, to conduct a two-hour
seminar on customer service for ten staff members.
Your Task
Plan the seminar:
(1) Write an e-mail to Julie Martin requesting the use
of the conference room #210, on March 31, from
8:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. This will give you thirty
minutes before and after the meeting to set up
and clean up the room. The seminar will be from 
8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m. This room will accommodate
eighteen people.
(2) Create a biography for Ms. Zamora; include her
education, experience as a customer service consult-
ant, and any other pertinent information you want to
include (make all this up).
(3) Retrieve the file named Part IV Johnson Catering
from the Web site. This file contains food prices from
which you are to choose. Write an e-mail to Johnson
Catering and order the following food, estimating the
amount of food needed and the cost. You will order
napkins, small plates, cutlery, coffee/cream, sugar, and
sugar substitute; orange juice; water/ice; an array of
breakfast pastries; and fruit plates (all served buffet
style) for the staff to be served at 8:30 a.m. Write an
e-mail to Ms. Quevedo to obtain her approval before
finalizing the food order.
(4) Create an e-mail to Ms. Zamora asking if she will
need a computer with PowerPoint, a lectern, and
microphone. Ask her if she would like you to make
copies of any handouts for her. If so, she can 
e-mail you the file to make the copies. Assume 
Ms. Zamora needs fifteen copies each of six docu-
ments. You can get each page copied at three cents
per page.
(5) Create an Excel spreadsheet or table in Word
(according to instructor’s direction) showing the
estimated expenses for this conference. Give all in-
formation about the seminar (title, date, time, etc.),
list each item’s cost individually, then multiply and
show the total for each item. Show a total cost for
the entire seminar.
(6) Assemble all documents in the order they were
created and type a cover memo to your instructor.

ooner or later in your career, you may be called upon to make a presentation.
Public speaking is a set of skills, not a talent. Anyone can develop effective
presentation skills. For many people, presenting a topic can be an unpleasant
experience. It need not be so.
The key to giving effective presentations is practice. Take advantage of every
opportunity you have; for instance, you may be comfortable around your cowork-
ers at staff meetings. When called upon to make a report, apply the techniques of
making effective presentations to giving your report in the meeting. The more ex-
perience you have at speaking before an audience, the more likely you will become
more comfortable at doing so. Where would be a better place to start than around
those with whom you feel most comfortable?
Presentations put you on display and allow you to show your audience how
skilled you are. First, though, you must learn the techniques of making effective
presentations, and that is the purpose of this chapter.
Planning a Presentation
As with any work you do, planning is the first, most important element of an effec-
tive presentation.With good planning you can polish your presentation skills, which
will allow you to speak with confidence, clarity, and conviction. See Figure 1 for the
process you must go through to plan an effective presentation.
514

Developing Effective Oral Presentations
DEFINE YOUR PURPOSE
The first step in planning your presentation is to define the purpose. Identifying
the purpose allows you to have a clear understanding of what you want your au-
dience to achieve as a result of listening to your presentation. In this step, ask your-
self some important questions, such as
• Why am I giving this presentation?
• What do I want my audience to do or leave knowing when my presentation
is over?
Limit your purpose to one goal. Most presentations are time limited, and it is
better to accomplish one goal than to rush through several goals and get none ac-
complished. Here are some examples of concise statements of purpose:
The purpose of my presentation is to
• explain the new method for submitting travel expenses and mileage.
• share information on two facilities, one of which will be selected for this year’s
company picnic.
In the first example, it is clear what you want your audience to do. You want
them to leave knowing how to correctly submit the forms for reporting travel ex-
penses and mileage.Think how important it is to accomplish this task in your pres-
entation so you are not faced with having to correct or retrain several members in
your audience. In the second example, you want the planning committee to be able
to select the facility for this year’s picnic based on the information in your presen-
tation.Your planning should be such that all the audience’s questions are answered
in the presentation.
CONSIDER YOUR AUDIENCE
You need to understand your audience. To reach them, you must understand what
they need. They will ask themselves as you speak,“What is in this presentation for
me?” If they don’t immediately identify with your message during your introduc-
tion, they may tune you out and not listen at all. Begin by asking yourself some ba-
sic questions about your audience:
• To whom am I speaking?
• What do they already know about the topic?
• What will they want to know about the topic?
• What do they need to know about the topic?
The answer to these questions will help you know what content should be pre-
sented and at what level to speak. If the audience consists mainly of experts, you
would not present basic information. If the audience consists of those individuals

515

Developing Effective Oral Presentations
Organizing the Content
It is imperative that you organize your content carefully (Figure 2). Your talk must
be well organized and your points presented logically and clearly. Introductions
and background information are boring. Unless it is necessary the audience knows
the information, avoid giving the basics—give it to them in a handout to be dis-
tributed later and get right to the point.
GAINING THE AUDIENCE’S ATTENTION IN THE INTRODUCTION
Many times the first few minutes of a presentation are lost while people find a
chair, drift in with coffee, and finish their conversations they were having with the
person next to them. Since you have a limited time, it is your responsibility to gain
their attention.
Here are some points to remember:
• Introduce yourself. If you are not formally introduced, make certain you intro-
duce yourself. Don’t assume everyone knows who you are. Describe your posi-
tion, knowledge, or experience; explain what qualifies you to speak on this topic.
• Handle administrative details. You should find out ahead of time if there are any
administrative details you need to handle with the audience. The audience can
become distracted and become worried if details are overlooked.
• Identify your role. You should plan exactly how you want to appear to your
audience—friend, expert, judge, teacher. Whatever role you choose, you must
establish it from the beginning.
FIGURE 2 • Plan your presentation before you begin writing.
who know very little about your topic, you would begin with the basics. Ideally, if
you had the opportunity to survey your audience, you would know what direction
to take when planning your presentation.

516

Developing Effective Oral Presentations
• Plan for questions. Identify in the beginning how you will handle questions so no
one in the audience will interrupt your presentation unless you want them to. You
may plan for a ten- to fifteen-minute question-and-answer session at the end.If you
say you will have this session, watch your time and be sure you allow time for it.
• Explain if there are handouts. If members of the audience know you will give
them copies or notes of your slides as a handout, many will relax and listen to
your presentation rather than trying to copy each slide as it is presented or take
notes vigorously.
• Give the audience an overview. In giving the overview, explain each point you
will cover. For instance, say something like “I will concentrate on the following
four points: First of all. . . . Then . . . This will lead to . . . and finally. . . .”This
will explain briefly how your presentation will proceed. The audience will then
know what to expect.
Now that you have the preliminaries out of the way, you must gain the audi-
ence’s attention. You should entice the audience to listen to you. Help them un-
derstand why they should listen. In the example given earlier where you would be
showing them how to complete the forms for reporting travel expense and mileage
correctly, they will listen because you are going to make their job easier. In the sec-
ond example, when the committee sees each facility’s strong points, they will be
able to decide where to have the company picnic.They can relax and listen because
you have done the work for them.
You want your audience to believe your presentation will be interesting, en-
joyable, and above all, worthwhile. Here are a few additional ways in which you
may gain their attention (Figure 3):
• Ask a poignant question.
• Use a famous quotation.

517

Developing Effective Oral Presentations
• Tell an anecdote or story.
• Make a startling comment such as “Did you know . . . statistics show . . .!”
• Give historical background.
• Refer to a current event.
• Explain your purpose.
This opening should lead naturally into your presentation. You should next
identify the first main point (“This morning/afternoon/evening I will begin by talk-
ing about. . . .”).
ORGANIZING MAIN POINTS
Most presentations are twenty or fewer minutes long, so limit your main points
to no more than four. Present each main point one by one in a logical order. Be
sure to use clear examples to illustrate each point.Always pause at the end of each
point. This gives your audience time to take notes, or to think about what you
have said. Make it absolutely clear when you move to the next point. For exam-
ple, say:
• “The next point I want to make is . . .”
• “I will now talk about . . .”
• “Let’s consider my next point . . .”
Extemporaneous speaking (speaking freely and naturally) is the most effective
delivery style because it allows you to continuously maintain eye contact with your
audience. It is not necessary to write a complete script of what you will say. If you
feel you need reminders to jog your memory as you give your presentation, use cue
cards. If you do so, the cards should be numbered and should contain only key
words or phrases in large enough bold type that you can read the word or phrase
at a glance.
KEEPING YOUR AUDIENCE INTERESTED
You should involve your audience whenever possible. The audience enjoys inter-
action more than just sitting and listening. The uniqueness and novelty of an ac-
tivity will increase the impact of your presentation. Even with large audiences, you
can build into your presentation brief exercises the audience can complete. Some
examples are
• a brief survey or checklist asking for opinions related to the topic;
• asking listeners to turn to the person sitting next to them and discuss briefly
some point;
• brief games that relate to the topic.
Here are some additional ideas to add variety to your presentation:
• Alternate moving and standing still, speaking and listening, doing and thinking.
• Add stories, anecdotes, testimonials, analogies, and demonstrations.
• Use humor appropriately and always in good taste.
• Read your audience. If the audience starts making movement sounds, and you
begin to hear low talking, you are losing them. This will tell you to move on and
even omit part of your presentation. Keep an eye on the audience’s body lan-
guage to know when to move more quickly through your presentation.

Developing Effective Oral Presentations
Remember your audience members will drift in and out listening to you; thus,
they will not give you their complete attention all the time. You can help them by
interjecting activity, movement, or involvement to bring their attention back to
your presentation.
SUMMARIZING AND CONCLUDING
Your closing remarks will leave a final impression on the audience, and these re-
marks will most likely be the one thing they remember from your presentation. Be-
cause of the impact a conclusion has, you need to plan your closing statements with
care. Don’t run over your time limit. Start on time and end on time. Although your
audience enjoyed your presentation, they will become restless and may even change
their opinion of your presentation if you keep them longer than the time limit.
Begin by getting your audience’s attention. Don’t tell them you will end by
summarizing even though that is what you might do. This will turn them off be-
cause they think they have heard all you have to say before. End with a change of
pace. Here are some effective conclusions:
• Give a simple review of the main points and purpose of the meeting. This clos-
ing usually will suffice if your presentation is for internal use.
• Demonstrate how all your main points fit together into an idea the audience can
take with them. You can also sum up the main points. You might say,“You have
learned this . . . this . . . and this. Now that you understand . . . you will be able
to . . .” or “Let’s look at what we learned today. . . .” or “So, in conclusion . . .” or
“Now to recap the main points . . .” or “My final point is . . .”
• Close with a question when you want the audience to continue thinking about
what you have said. An example would be “Now that you know the how-to,
will you make the commitment this week to meet the challenge?”
Explain your conclusions by pulling together your opening and your overall
purpose. Explain how the main points will enable them to achieve their purpose.
Encourage or motivate them to action by making a moving statement, telling a
moving story, or making a call to action or a challenge.
The main thing to remember is your closing needs to be clear,logical,and strong.
HANDLING QUESTIONS/COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE
Make certain you leave enough time for the audience to ask questions if you told
them in the beginning you would do so. Here are some points to remember:
• Don’t just ask for questions; guide your audience through the main points. For
example, say, “What questions do you have about . . .?”

Developing Effective Oral Presentations
• When a question is asked, be sure to listen carefully so you understand what is
being asked. If you don’t understand the question, ask for clarification. It is
often helpful to rephrase the question in your own words to make sure you
understood what was asked. Rephrasing questions will allow you to shorten
long, rambling questions.
• Don’t be afraid to admit you don’t know. Tell them you’ll find out and get back
to them, and then be sure to do so.
• Be sure to repeat each question over the microphone for large audiences so
everyone can hear the question before you respond.
• Don’t rush an answer. Pause and think about what you are going to say before
you respond. When you answer, get to the point; don’t digress.
• If no questions are asked, be sure you have one or two questions you can ask of
the audience to begin the discussion.
Managing Hecklers
Hecklers are people who shout an uninvited comment or ask deliberate questions
meant to interrupt, anger, or upset a speaker. Prepare yourself for the worst ques-
tions by anticipating what they will be and planning answers for them. Answering
questions is an important part of your presentation skills. No matter what you do,
remain calm if a person begins to heckle you. The worst thing you can do is to
show anger. If you don’t want to answer the heckler, simply say, “Thank you for
your opinion” and move on. Don’t let yourself get into an argument. An argument
only gives the heckler control.
Delivering the Presentation
All presentations should have structure, which allows your audience to follow
your meanings. Structure means the manner of construction of the presentation
and the logical arrangement of its parts.
STRUCTURING YOUR PRESENTATION
Choose the way you want to deliver your ideas.Your choice will depend on what type
of presentation you are making. For instance, you might choose one method if you
are in a staff meeting where your presentation is disseminating information, another
method when explaining a decision that has already been made, or a formal presen-
tation as guest speaker for a large group. See Figure 4 for some other choices.

PRESENTATION STRUCTURE
General to specific
Allows you to present each main topic followed by a subtopic, which is then followed by a statement
that leads to a specific conclusion.
Questioning
Introduces relevant background information followed by possible solutions with advantages and disad-
vantages given for each solution. Finally, summarize all possible solutions with the preferred solution
identified for the audience, asking the audience for approval or discussion.
Specific to general
The reverse of general to specific. Present the details first, which leads to a main point. Each point is
treated the same way. All main points are then summarized.
Beginning-middle-end
Provides a brief introduction, followed by all main points, and ending with a brief conclusion.
This structure is the simplest, most direct, and most often used method of structuring 
presentations.
FIGURE 4 • Ways to structure your presentation.
Once you have identified the purpose of your presentation, you should choose
the most appropriate structure to achieve your purpose.
MAKING YOUR PRESENTATION
Delivery has to do with how you present yourself to the audience. Audience mem-
bers will focus their attention on you, and you can make or break the presentation
by your actions.As you speak, the audience will be observing eyes, voice, body lan-
guage, and appearance.
Your Eyes
Your eyes are by far the most important of the four parts of the human body that
will influence audience response. Your eyes will convince the audience of your
honesty, openness, and confidence. During your presentation you should establish
eye contact with each member of the audience. If your audience is large, you can
do this by continually looking to the right, to the left, straight ahead in the dis-
tance, and then repeat the same procedure down front. Each member will feel as
if you are looking at him or her because it is difficult to tell precisely where you
are looking. Hold your gaze fixed at each point for five or six seconds before
changing. A quick smile before changing positions will convince audience mem-
bers in that direction you have seen them and acknowledge their presence.
Your Voice
Your voice’s projection and variation are its most important aspects. Speak clearly.
Don’t shout or whisper. Deliberately pause at key points. Slow down and take your
time.You should speak slightly louder and slightly slower than when talking normally.
How you say it is as important as what you say. Here are some points to remember:
• Speak loud enough for everyone to hear you. It is best to check the acoustics in
the room prior to your presentation.
• Vary the volume and pitch of your voice. Use a higher pitch when making a
new point.
• Keep your words simple. Don’t try to impress the audience with your vocabulary.
521

Developing Effective Oral Presentations
• Check the pronunciation of difficult, unusual, or foreign words before your
presentation.
• Be careful of verbal ties such as uh, you know, or like.
• Drink water before you speak, as it will lubricate your vocal chords. Breathe
deeply and slowly to project your voice.
Body Language and Appearance
Face your audience. Avoid talking to the visual if using slides, transparencies,
whiteboard, or easel tablet. You will lose your audience if you do not focus on
them. Here are some do’s and don’ts to remember.
Do:
• Stand securely with legs slightly apart, back straight, and body relaxed facing the
audience. If you are a female, do not wear high heels unless it is a fashion event.
• Keep your arm and hand gestures under control. Move your arms only above
the belt line and slightly outside the chest area.
• Make planned position changes. Walk calmly toward the screen, overhead,
tablet, or whiteboard. Make a brief stop on the way and continue your pres-
entation with a few remarks.
• Use body language to convey your message. When you talk in a conversation
with friends, you use your hands, facial expressions, and body to enhance un-
derstanding. Do the same in your presentation. It will make your presenta-
tion more interesting for the audience.
• Dress appropriately for your audience, not for yourself. First impressions in-
fluence the audience’s attitude toward you. Even though dress is a personal
choice, select your clothes carefully and deliberately. It is better to be over-
dressed than underdressed when making a presentation.
Don’t:
• Pace back and forth,rock back and forth,or stand stiffly in one place all the time.
• Play with the pointer, fumble with notes, or rattle change in your pocket.
• Read the presentation from your notes, screen, or tablet.
• Block visual aids from your audience.
• Avoid annoying habits . . .“uh,”“um,”“okay,”“you know what I mean,” etc.
Practice, Practice, Practice
Rehearsing could make the difference between an effective and an average presen-
tation. Plan to rehearse your presentation aloud at least four times. Make sure one
of your rehearsals is in front of an audience—family, friends, colleagues, or children.
They will be brutally honest with you on what you should or should not do or say.
Each time you rehearse, time yourself so you can adjust the presentation to fit the

time allotted. Another excellent practice is to videotape or record yourself. Either of
these practices will give you feedback and help fine-tune your presentation.
EVALUATING YOUR PRESENTATION
Encourage those around you to give you feedback about your presentation. You
can also prepare an evaluation form to have the audience complete at the end of
your presentation. The feedback you receive from these forms can be invaluable to
help you plan your next presentation. One thing to remember is you cannot please
everyone, so ignore those evaluations that are low or have negative comments. Fo-
cus on the majority of the evaluations and use the comments as a way to improve.

Developing Effective Oral Presentations
To help improve your presentation, answer the following questions:
• Was the purpose achieved?
• Was the information relevant?
• Did anything unexpected happen?
• Did I begin and end on time?
• Did all visuals support the presentation effectively?
• Did I allow time for questions?
• What did I learn from this presentation?
• What could I do differently next time?
Designing a Multimedia Presentation
Visuals give presentations clarity and make them interesting. As well as slide pre-
sentations using software such as PowerPoint, you should also consider DVD/CD
material, demonstration or role-plays, photographs, illustrations, maps, graphs,
and diagrams. Remember your presentation does not have to be technical to be
effective. Ask yourself these questions about the visuals you choose:
• Can the audience quickly and easily grasp what they see?
• Are they spending more time reading and not listening?
SELECTING THE DESIGN
When using visuals, design can enhance or defeat the purpose of your presentation
no matter how important your information is. These important design concepts
can help avoid a visual disaster.
Make Your Font Size BIG!
The one thing you want to be sure is that everyone in the audience can see and
read each visual you plan to use. A rule of thumb is if it looks right on your com-
puter screen, it is probably too small. Stand about six feet away from your screen.
Keep enlarging the font size until you can read it from that distance; then it should
be about the right size. There is nothing more frustrating than sitting in a meeting
and squinting to read the slide projected on the screen.
If you choose larger text, it will be easier to see from the back of the room,
but you will not get much information on one slide (Figure 6). Make the font size
24–48 point. A mixture of upper- and lowercase characters is easier to read.
Keep Each Slide Simple
Use only essential elements of the concepts you plan to discuss. Use only single
words or phrases on each slide. Use text sparingly. Never use complete sentences.
The slide should not explain your point; you should explain the point to the au-
dience. Here are some rules to follow when making slides:
• Design each slide so it is uncluttered and simple.
• Take time to make each slide attractive and visually appealing.
• Use bold and large-size fonts for emphasis.
524

Developing Effective Oral Presentations
• Limit each line to no more than seven words.
• Limit the number of text slides in a row.
Pausing for a few seconds after a new slide appears to give the audience time
to view the slide and understand it. Once you have their attention, expand upon
the pertinent information related to that slide. Interweave graphics, graphs, or sim-
ple tables that present information. Be prepared to explain completely the data and
source behind any graph.
Keep Your Format Consistent
Be consistent by using the same format throughout your slides. This means in the
use of design, color, font size, and so on. If you use color, use no more than three
colors. Change distracts the audience and makes it difficult to follow the logical
sequence of your points. A good idea is to use a summary slide at the beginning
to introduce the audience to your presentation; then use the same slide as a sum-
mary at the end. This gives the audience the feeling your presentation has come
full circle.
USING POWERPOINT 2007
Because PowerPoint is part of MS Office, it is the most commonly used presenta-
tion software program. The following gives you a step-by-step procedure to create
a simple PowerPoint presentation. The example will use Figure 7 to create a pres-
entation. In these steps, you will also find text designed to add information about
PowerPoint.
1. Click the Start Button on the taskbar, click All Programs, click Microsoft®
Office, and then click Microsoft® Office PowerPoint 2007. If PowerPoint
2007 is installed on your desktop, click the PowerPoint 2007 icon.
2. Click the Office button. Then click New. The New Presentation dialog box
opens.
PowerPoint quickly helps you create effective presentations by using a
template, a PowerPoint file that contains colors, background format, font

styles, and accent colors for a presentation. Several templates are available in
PowerPoint; however, you may download many more from Microsoft® Office
Online, which provides a variety of templates including agendas, award cer-
tificates, calendars, designs, reports, resumes, schedules, and so forth. After
you select a category, you can download different templates to see which you
like the most.

3. To use a template, click on Microsoft® Office Online, Design Slides, and then
Business. You will see a variety of templates from which to choose. For this
example, scroll down and select the Brown Bag Design template and click on
the Download button at the lower right.
4. Save and name the presentation “Brown Bag Presentation.”
Now that you have started a presentation using a template, you are ready
to edit the words in the presentation and enter those of your choice. You now
have a presentation design for your entire presentation. Don’t change tem-
plates or colors. The same design throughout the presentation is more effec-
tive for your audience to follow.
The template includes the title slide, as well as other slides, with sug-
gested text placeholders. A placeholder is a region of the slide, or location in
an outline, reserved for inserting text or graphics. To edit the template out-
line, you must insert text or objects into the placeholders one at a time. You
must click on each part of the slide where you want to enter information to
make it active.
5. To edit and replace the text in the first slide, click on Click to add title, press
the Caps Lock key, type the title “PRESENTATION SKILLS,” and press Enter.
6. Next, click Click to add subtitle. Turn off the Caps Lock key and key your
name as the subtitle.
7. To add another slide, click on New Slide on the Slides ribbon. A selection of
several slide template designs appears. Click on Title and Content slide.
8. To edit this second slide, click on Click to add title. Type “Planning Your
Presentation” as your title; click Click to add text. A bullet will appear to the
left; key “Define your purpose” and press Enter. Another bullet will appear to
the left; key “Consider your audience”. Do not press Enter after the last entry
on your slide to avoid placing another bullet on the slide.

ning on the Ribbon. Press the N key to move to the next slide; press the “P”
key to move to the previous slide; press the Esc key to end the presentation.
12. Exit PowerPoint as you would in all MS Office™ programs.
PRODUCING SPEAKER’S NOTES AND HANDOUTS
Speaker notes and handouts can free the audience from having to make or take co-
pious notes during your presentation and allow them to relax and listen. Let your
audience know when the notes or handouts will be distributed. You have two
choices about when to distribute handouts. First, you can wait until the end to
avoid the audience reading through your presentation, turning pages and making
noise while you are trying to speak. At the end is best when the purpose of your
527

Developing Effective Oral Presentations
presentation is to give general information or when your audience has some
knowledge of your topic. Second, you can choose to give the handouts to the
audience at the beginning so they will be able to make notes as you are speaking.
At the beginning is best when the purpose of your presentation is explaining a
detailed procedure the audience knows little about but must follow to complete a
specific task. Be sure you get a count of the number attending and provide ample
copies so everyone is given a handout.
Handouts can reinforce your main points and can often provide background
information that will be helpful to the reader. They should not distract the audi-
ence. Handouts should
• be simple;
• be related directly to the purpose of your presentation;
• have high visual impact.
ADDING MULTIMEDIA FEATURES
Use animation and sound effects sparingly because they can distract the audience.
Use transitions that are simple and easily reveal information at the right time.
Don’t try to impress the audience with your presentation skills. Keeping the slides
simple is always the best way to avoid the visuals distracting the audience.
TRAVELING AND PRESENTING
As an office professional, you might be asked to make a training presentation or
a presentation explaining a change in certain procedures to the staff or a presen-
tation to the members of a professional organization of which you are a member.
If your company has several locations, you might have to travel to make a pres-
entation. Suppose you have created a fantastic PowerPoint presentation.You work
at your company’s main headquarters in Washington and have been asked to travel
to Langley, Virginia, at one of the branch offices to present it. You have worked
hours on it to set the timings of the animations and transitions just right.You spent
a great deal of time selecting the right kind of music to go with the introduction
and conclusion. You have included some animated graphics and even a short
movie to showcase certain information. Remember if the worse can happen, it
probably will.What kinds of problems might you anticipate? Here are some major
ones along with a suggested solution(s):
• Problem. What would you do if you found the computer you were to use had
an older version of PowerPoint on it, and you created your presentation in a
newer version, or what if the computer did not have PowerPoint at all?

Solution. First, you could take your laptop. That would resolve some problems.
However, there is another solution. The problem of not having PowerPoint was
what prompted Microsoft® to create a PowerPoint Viewer program. Microsoft®
provides the PowerPoint Viewer free of charge so that people can view Power-
Point presentations without having to purchase the full PowerPoint software
package. The viewer is available in three versions: PowerPoint Viewer 97,
PowerPoint Viewer 2003, and PowerPoint 2007. Although the 97 viewer has to
be installed before it can be used, the 2003 viewer can be used straight from the
CD without having to be installed. PowerPoint Viewer 2007 lets you view full-
featured presentations created in PowerPoint 97 and later versions. You can
view and print presentations in these versions, but you cannot edit them in any
of these viewers. Download these viewers to your laptop or to a CD.
• Problem. What if no flash drive plug-in is available, but a CD drive is, or what
if the computer only has a 3.5-inch floppy?
Solution. Take a copy of your presentation and a copy of Viewer on a flash
drive, a CD, and a 3.5-inch floppy drive. Make sure you take timed sounds,
animation, and music files not embedded in your presentation with you on each
storage device as well.
• Problem. What if you had planned to use the host company’s computer and
found it was old and slow?
Solution. When you plan to use someone else’s computer, you don’t have a lap-
top, and you couldn’t find anything about what computer would be available
even by talking to someone:
• Always develop your presentation on the oldest, slowest, least powerful com-
puter you have available that you expect the presentation is to be run on. If
you develop your presentation on a high-powered computer, the older, slower
computer will get bogged down and may even appear as if it has a virus on
it.All those multiple effects you used will require PowerPoint to do more with
less. Create your presentation with a minimal amount of special effects.
• Keep your files small. The bigger the file the more problems another com-
puter will have running the presentation.
• Use common fonts found on most computers such as Times New Roman,
Arial, or Cambria. If you use unusual fonts, embed them. Even if you antici-
pate all these problems, you may still have some minor ones. Planning for the
worst can help avoid the major ones.
Dealing with Nervousness
A certain amount of nervousness, also called podium panic, is common for all pre-
senters.You are not alone. In most cases, however, the audience doesn’t even know
you are afraid (see Figure 8). There are several ways to get past the anxiety by re-
laxing and then focusing only on the presentation. Remember the audience does
not know what you are going to say, so if you stumble over a part and skip saying
something you planned to say, they will never know the difference! Here are some
techniques to help you overcome podium panic:
• Use a relaxation technique. Take a deep breath—as deep as possible—and hold
it in and slowly count to ten; after counting, completely exhale all the air you
529

can and relax every bone and muscle in your body. Slowly count to
ten again; repeat the process ten times. While taking the deep breath-
ing exercises, think only of the number one; see it in your mind.
No matter what tries to come into your mind, think only of the
number one.
• Expect success. Your nervousness and fear may be connected with
low self-esteem. Instead of picturing failure, imagine yourself giving
a good, strong presentation. Be aware of your internal dialogue and
think positive thoughts about your ability to make presentations.
Everyone is nervous and does not want to look foolish, but your
nervousness can actually improve your presentation. It can give you
the energy to make your presentation interesting, exciting, and mem-
orable.
• Prepare thoroughly. Rehearse your presentation a minimum of four
times—at least twice before a mirror and twice before friends or fam-
ily. They will be honest with you about ways to improve.
• Practice for distractions. Many of your fears may be related to being
afraid you will lose concentration. If you do, just tell the audience,
“Give me a moment to organize my thoughts.” Pause, take a deep
breath, relax, and begin where you left off, perhaps by repeating the
last point. The audience won’t mind; they understand how difficult
it is to speak before a group. Also, as you practice, have someone
deliberately interrupt you by slamming a door, turning on the TV,
dropping things, or coming in and out of the room.
• Never memorize a speech. Speak naturally and let the audience feel as if they
know you and understand you may be nervous.
• Think of communication, not performance. Think of the purpose of your presen-
tation and what you want your audience to know when you are finished. Focus
on your words and how clearly you are speaking. Take deep breaths often.
• Know that nervousness and its symptoms are not seen. Never call attention to
it or apologize for it.
Developing Effective Oral Presentations
FIGURE 8 • Exercise can help relieve
nervousness.
Ethics and Speaking
If your presentation is to be effective, your audience must believe you to be credi-
ble, truthful, and qualified. Every statement you make, each figure you show, and
each conclusion you draw, must be supported by fact or based on credible infor-
mation. Not only is your presentation being judged, but your professional reputa-
tion is being judged as well. Never say anything you cannot prove should someone
question it.
For example, Olivia Venzor presented material at a conference. She used ma-
terial she had researched. After her presentation, several participants came to her
and said they were familiar with the research behind the topic she had presented
and were offended she had not given appropriate credit for the materials. Olivia
apologized for not identifying the source. Even though this error was not inten-
tional, it may affect her future presentations with this group. An apology may not
have been enough to rebuild her credibility.
Always give credit where credit is due.

Developing Effective Oral Presentations
Speaking to Diverse Audiences
You most likely will not be asked to speak to an international audience as an of-
fice professional, but you might be asked to help prepare a presentation for your
manager or some other executive (Figure 9).
U.S. audiences are becoming more diverse. It is the speaker’s responsibility to
be aware of and acknowledge whether or not a significant portion of the audience
comes from different backgrounds. Recognizing cultural differences and adjusting
your presentation accordingly means the chances of these cultures achieving the
purpose of your presentation is greatly increased. You should research the cultures
of your audience.
Here are some tips to help improve your success when facing diverse audiences:
• Consider the pace of presenting information. We have been trained that a pres-
entation should consist of a progression from an introduction, to the body, then
to the conclusion. That may not be the case in international circles. You may
need to adjust your presentation to quickly present your main points, prove
each concisely, and move right to your recommendations.
• Be careful when using humor. It is up to you to research local customs and types
of humor that are appreciated in that culture to avoid offending someone.
• Be careful when selecting color in your visuals. Colors carry different sugges-
tions and meanings in different cultures. In Japan, for example, white symbol-
izes death.
• Know what to expect when it comes to questions. Americans and Canadians are
comfortable with questions; most Asian cultures are more likely to respond with
silence or perhaps only a few questions.
• Choose your words carefully. Although English is widely spoken around the
world, use simple words. Avoid slang, American buzz words, and sports terms.
Remember, many English words have different meanings when translated into
another language. For instance, mad to us means angry, but to the British it
means insane.
• Pay attention to protocol. You should research the appropriate way to ac-
knowledge your hosts and other key people in the audience so as not to offend.
• Speak slower than normal. Your audience may include non-English-speaking in-
dividuals. They often translate mentally from English into their native tongue

Developing Effective Oral Presentations
Quick Tips
A BASIC PRESENTATION
You may have heard this method of explaining how to deliver a
presentation:
• Tell what you are going to tell them,
• then tell them,
• then tell them again what you told them.
This structure follows the beginning-middle-end structure and is quick
and easy to remember.
when listening, and this takes a few seconds to translate. If you speak at a
slightly slower pace, your audience will be more comfortable, and they will
appreciate your doing so.
• Know what to expect from your audience. Other cultures respond outwardly to
presentations in different ways. For example, audience members in Japan may
show concentration by closing their eyes and nodding their head up and down
slightly. This doesn’t mean you are putting your audience to sleep. In Germany
and Austria, your audience may rap on the table instead of applauding; if you
wave goodbye to Latin Americans and certain cultures in Europe, the audience
will remain seated and won’t leave.The point is to know how each audience will
respond.
You can help your manager by researching how best to structure the presen-
tation to achieve its purpose. Use reference books, travel guides, and Web sites that
serve foreign travelers. The U.S. State Department Web site (www.state.gov) has a
wealth of information.

Building Your Office Skills 
Exploring the Workplace: Activities 
1. Interview an individual who holds a position in your
career area and gives presentations. Ask the follow-
ing questions:
• How important is oral communications in your
job?
• What type of presentations, either formal or 
informal, do you make and how often do you
make them?
• How do you typically prepare these presentations?
• How important has the ability to present been
to your career advancement?
Create an informational report for your instructor.
Identify the person’s position, typical responsibili-
ties, and company. Type each question followed by
his or her response. End your report with an expla-
nation of what you learned from this experience. Be
ready to present your information to the class.
2. As a team, visit a business meeting, board meeting,
city council meeting, campus club meeting, or any
place where oral presentations are being made. Use
the speaker evaluation checklist in Figure 5 to eval-
uate one of the speakers. Write a one-page memo to
your instructor explaining the following: where you
went, what the meeting was, who you evaluated, and
what each person learned from this experience.
3. You learned in this chapter you must gain your audi-
ence’s attention.You can do this by asking a question,
using a quotation, telling an anecdote or story, mak-
ing a startling comment, giving historical back-
ground, or referring to a current event. Choose two of
the following situations and prepare an opening for
each (select either for or against) that would gain your
audience’s attention:
a. Background checks should/should not be
mandatory for all employees.
b. Drug testing should/should not be mandatory
for all employees.
c. All full-time college students should/should not
be required to own a laptop computer.
d. All students in public schools should/should not
be required to wear uniforms.
4. You are to give a presentation to a diverse audience
and need to gather information about your
audience. Select any two cultures other than your
own to research. Go to https://www.cia.gov/library/
publications/the-world-factbook/index.html and
locate information on your chosen cultures. Search
elsewhere on the Internet for information about
food, customs, and famous people, and so on. Write
an information report on what you found on each
culture that will help you in your presentation. If
directed, be prepared to present your information.

1. Critiquing a friend. Your team has agreed that each
month a different team member would give a presen-
tation to help develop everyone’s presentation skills.
At the end of the presentation, the team would orally
critique the presentation to give feedback. You are in
this month’s team meeting and your good friend and
coworker, JoElla, has just given a presentation that
she spent very little time developing. So much time
was wasted at the end of her presentation clarifying
the information that other important matters could
not be discussed. You are the first person to critique
JoElla’s presentation. Your honest evaluation is she
did a poor job.What oral comments will you make to
help JoElla improve? How will you critique her pres-
entation without hurting her feelings?
2. Handling a heckler. David Hughes works in your
company. You know who he is but do not know or
work with him personally. You have noticed at every
meeting you are in with him, he tries to heckle the
speaker. He interrupts in the middle of a presenta-
tion and asks a question even though the presenter
has announced that questions will be taken at the
end. He criticizes the presentations and generally
makes a nuisance of himself in every meeting. You
will be presenting next week, and he will be there.
How do you plan to handle David and his heckling?
3. Short on handouts. You are giving a presentation

Rule 23: Choose Active-Voice over Passive-Voice
The property of a verb that indicates whether the subject
acts or is acted upon is either active or passive voice. In
sentences that are written with active-voice verbs, the
subject of the sentence is the doer of the action. In sen-
tences written with passive-voice verbs, the subject is
acted upon.
Active voice: Lisa managed the apartments for ten
years.
Passive voice: The apartments were managed by
Lisa for ten years.
Notice in the active voice the emphasis is on Lisa. Active-
voice sentences are shorter, more direct, and easier to un-
derstand than passive-voice sentences. The reader knows
immediately who did the action. Most business writing
should use active-voice verbs.
In the passive-voice sentence the emphasis is on
apartments. Passive-voice sentences show less emphasis
on who did the action. When writing about a sensitive is-
sue such as negative news, the passive voice can be used
to soften the blow and avoid directness.

Working in a Medical Office
The Medical Office
You have already learned many procedures and developed the skills necessary to
perform tasks in various types of offices. Most offices have certain basic tasks that
are performed by their workforce every day. Some tasks are specialized according
to the size of the office, the type of work done in the office, or the number of em-
ployees. Being expert at basic skills will give you a competitive edge when you seek
employment at almost any type of office. Let’s now relate all of these skills to
working in a medical office: What general basic skills are needed, how can you per-
fect them, and what do you need in the way of additional, more complex compe-
tencies? Isn’t that an exciting prospective job?
TYPES OF MEDICAL OFFICES
Because the health care industry is booming, a well-trained and highly skilled med-
ical office professional has a variety of opportunities in many different settings.
Physician Practice
The most common place of employment for medical front office staff is in a physi-
cian’s practice. In this chapter, the word practice refers to the professional business
of the doctor.
Working in a small office where one (sole proprietor) or two physicians (part-
nership) practice, you have a great deal of responsibility; variety in the tasks per-
formed; and opportunities to form close relationships with the physicians, medical
staff, and patients.
Today the majority of physicians have formed group practices in which they
share resources (personnel, space, and equipment). In this setting, you may spe-
cialize in the tasks performed. For instance, you may perform job tasks related to
the receptionist area, insurance, or billing.
Medical Specialties
As a medical office professional, you will find job opportunities in a variety of
medical practices. For example, medical practices consist of generalists, specialists,
or a combination of generalists and specialists. From the Association of American
Medical Colleges (AAMC) Web site at www.aamc.org, a partial list of specialties
is included in Figure 1. To learn about the specialties, you can visit AAMC’s Web
site.
Ambulatory Center
The medical office professional may be employed by an ambulatory center, also
known as an urgent care center. The center offers medical services for extended
hours, some open twenty-four hours a day. Job opportunities for the medical office
professional in ambulatory centers are usually limited to receptionist and records.
Clinic
A clinic may specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of a specific medical need
and may be set up to serve a specific geographic area. Some group practices are
considered clinics. An example would be a women’s clinic where the clinic serves
a specialty and all physicians who work in the clinic practice the same specialty or
offer related services.
544

FIGURE 1 • A partial list of specialties.
Working in a Medical Office
Hospital and Medical Center
These large complexes employ many medical office professionals, particularly
those skilled in specific medical office management tasks. Different positions are
available throughout these facilities including admissions, insurance, billing, and
medical records. Career opportunities are abundant in these medical settings.
Other Medical Settings
Other employment opportunities are found in research centers; laboratories; nurs-
ing and retirement homes; specialized care centers; such as psychiatric and reha-
bilitation; and insurance companies.
Because physicians are so highly trained and because they must deal with life-
and-death situations in which mistakes may kill, they want a staff that is also
highly trained. That is where you come in.
MEDICAL OFFICE CAREERS
What careers have been common and what tasks have the people in these careers
been performing? Let’s take a moment and reflect on several advertisements for
skilled medical office workers that have appeared in newspapers lately.
Medical Assistant—Pediatrics. Full-time position responsible for assisting
physicians in all clinical areas of the office with some clerical duties. Qualifi-
cations include a high school diploma and knowledge of medical terminology
and procedures. A graduate of an accredited medical assisting program and 
medical computer experience are preferred. Experience should include 1–3 years
of physician office experience.
Medical Transcriptionist. Accurate and timely transcription of medical re-
search and correspondence for physicians and nurses from recorded dictation
or written documentation. Candidates must be proficient in Microsoft® Word.
Experience in an orthopedic surgical practice is desirable.
Secretary for Medical Practice. Busy medical practice needs a secretary with
expertise in Microsoft® Office, travel arrangements, and Internet research.
Confidentiality is imperative.

545

Working in a Medical Office
Transcription/Dictation Coordinator. Busy medical practice specializing in
foot and ankle disorders needs a coordinator to interact with outside tran-
scription companies, review all transcription, correct formatting and spelling
errors, research missing dictation, print finalized notes and letters, and file dic-
tation in charts. Must be familiar with medical terminology, MS Word, and
have good organizational skills and dependability.
Receptionist, Full-time, Spanish a Plus. Greet patients and provide them with
accurate information and/or appropriate assistance; process information and
complete related paperwork; provide clerical support, including answering
phones, processing mail, and greeting clients. Qualifications include high
school diploma or equivalent; 2–4 years related work experience preferred;
type 30 WPM preferred; accounting experience preferred.
Coding Specialist. Responsible for abstracting clinical information and as-
signing CPT-4, ICD-9 and HCPCS (supplies and pharmaceuticals) codes
from medical records and documents to support physicians professional fees;
continuously monitor and follow up on pending documentation required to
perform abstraction and coding for assigned unites/services; assist in the
annual update of physician charge tickets to incorporate new and revised
CPT-4 and ICD-9 codes that are published yearly; work denials and answer
physician, patient, coworker, or insurance company questions as it related to
coding and billing. Perform routine coding audits. Required Skills: high
school diploma or equivalent with certification as an RRA, RHIT, CPC,
CCS-P or graduation from an accredited Medical Coding Specialist program
preferred; with an MCS or equivalent work experience coding in a setting
(with agreement to become certified within 12 months of employment);
knowledge of medical terminology, anatomy and physiology and disease
process; knowledge of a medical record content an how to interpret its con-
tents; knowledge of CPT-4 and ICD-9 coding; knowledge of health insurance
processing.
As you review these positions, think about the skills required such as medical termi-
nology, office procedures, organizational ability, multitasking, and dependability.
The skills required of a medical assistant who assists the physician or other
medical staff are the same as the skills required of the front office staff in areas
such as communication and office administration. In addition to these two areas,
medical assistants must also possess clinical skills such as diagnostic procedures
and patient care. If you are interested in a medical assistant career path, visit the
American Association of Medical Assistants (AAMA) Web site at www.aama.org.
MEDICAL OFFICE SKILLS
This section focuses on office administrative tasks and skills, communication
skills, and other essential skills required in most medical office careers.
Administrative Tasks
Whether you work as a medical receptionist, medical secretary, or medical office as-
sistant, you will perform a variety of administrative tasks, including the following:
• Front desk procedures include greeting patients and other visitors, such as phar-
maceutical representatives; verifying personal information about patients; and
collecting payments.
546

Working in a Medical Office
• Administrative procedures include opening and sorting incoming mail; com-
posing routine correspondence; preparing outgoing mail, such as applying
postage to patient statements, using a postage meter; and applying policies, pro-
cedures, and guidelines established by third-party and managed care groups.
• Scheduling includes coordinating and monitoring appointments. In some med-
ical offices, the job description of a scheduler is different from a receptionist.Al-
though this person may perform other tasks, the primary responsibility is to
schedule inpatient/outpatient admissions and procedures.
• Records management includes establishing, organizing, and maintaining patient
medical records. In some offices, a medical assistant handles this task. In larger
medical offices, a records technician may store and retrieve records needed for
physician encounters.
• Billing and insurance include performing procedural and diagnostic coding for
reimbursement; processing and following up on insurance claims and patients’
bills; and guiding patients to available financial arrangements for payment.
In most offices, these tasks are performed by billing/coding specialists. In larger 
offices, these tasks may be divided between billing/coding specialists and insur-
ance specialists.
Communciation Skills
In addition to the technical skills needed to perform the tasks above, medical
office professionals must be able to communicate effectively with physicians,
medical staff, patients, and visitors, such as vendors. The following list of com-
munication skills, adapted from the AAMA’s Web site, presents a review of the
skills needed:
• Recognize and respect cultural diversity.
• Adapt communications to individual’s understanding.
• Apply professional telephone and interpersonal techniques.
• Recognize and respond effectively to verbal,nonverbal,and written communication.
• Receive, organize, prioritize, store, and maintain transmittable information in
electronic form.
Other Essential Knowledge and Skills
Let’s identify other skills required of medical office professionals:
• Basic medical terminology.
• Knowledge of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA), which requires medical offices to inform patients how they handle pa-
tients’ personal and health information and more.
• Medical software program, which allows medical office staff to create patient
records; schedule, coordinate, and monitor appointments; and perform prac-
tice finances, such as performing billing and collection procedures to name 
a few.
• In addition to the skills listed above, being bilingual is now a basic skill that is
valued in most areas of the country because the population is so diverse. It
would be an added bonus in any office. In a medical practice, people from many
ethnic backgrounds converge, and it is very helpful if someone can help a per-
son in pain communicate correctly to a doctor.
547

Basic Medical Office Positions
There are basically four areas of positions available in a medical office. First, front
office positions are available that provide opportunities for employees to work up
front with the patients and get information from them before and after they see
the doctor. These positions may be known as the receptionist, intake personnel,
or front office staff. These employees may be supervised by an office manager or
administrator.
Second, there is the clinical staff made of medical assistants nurse practitioners
and physician’s assistants. Third, the physicians who maintain relationships be-
tween the clinical staff and the front office personnel. Last, there are the billing and
accounts receivable personnel. In some practices, the tasks are outsourced to inde-
pendent billing organizations.
In this chapter, we will focus on two areas: front office and billing.
FRONT OFFICE STAFF
The front office staff consists of two or more persons depending on how busy the of-
fice is. For example, if the office sees 200 or more patients per day, more front office
personnel would be required in an office where there are many doctors and many
physician assistants than in an office that has only one doctor, one nurse or nurse
practitioner, and a few medical assistants who see about fifty-five patients per day
(see Figure 2).
In a larger office, tasks are quite specialized. This means there may be two re-
ceptionists or intake persons checking in patients. In addition, there may be two
or three other employees (outtake persons) checking patients out of the office.
Receptionists or intake persons who check in patients have them sign a log-in
sheet (see Figure 3), have them fill out legal forms, ask for their insurance card or

cards, and collect insurance co-payments (charges assigned by the insurance com-
pany) or any balance due on their account.
Most health insurance falls into two basic categories: Either they are HMOs or
PPOs. Health maintenance organization (HMO) patients are easiest to handle for
the front office staff. The patient just pays the amount printed on his or her insur-
ance card. If the doctor seen is a specialist, the patient needs to obtain a referral from
his or her primary care physician prior to the office visit. If the patient has a preferred
provider organization (PPO) insurance policy, more than likely the patient has a
deductible to be met annually in addition to a co-pay amount printed on the front
of the insurance card. Many times, the patient with a PPO insurance plan also has to
pay a co-pay for x-rays or injections. Here is where the front office staff needs to con-
tact the patient’s insurance company prior to the new patient’s visit to the practice
549

to find out the amount of the deductible, what has
already been paid toward that amount, and any other
co-pays the patient has with the policy written by that
particular insurance company.To add to the confusion,
insurance companies change policies quite often.
If the patient cannot pay the account in full, the
patient is encouraged to sign papers stating that he or
she will pay within a certain number of days.
The employees who check out patients hand them
their prescriptions, sample medications, schedule tests
or physical therapy for them as well as schedule the
patients for their next visit when the doctor says they
should return. Most patients like to receive an
appointment card with the next appointment written
on it as a reminder (see Figure 4).These outtake persons also collect any additional
charges that may have occurred while the doctor was with them. For example, if
there was an injection or x-ray, many insurance companies require patients to pay
a co-pay for these services.
Likewise, there may be employees (called schedulers or appointment makers)
who collect charts of patients coming in the next day and contact them regarding
their appointments. These employees review every chart to make certain that the
notes and reports are in chronological order, and any outstanding balance is con-
veyed to the patient at the time of the call so he or she can pay at the appointment
the next day. In a specialist’s office, these appointment people also make certain
that the patient has a valid referral to see the specialist depending on the type of
insurance the patient has. A referral contains information such as that shown in
Figure 5.
In larger offices, some employees file charts most of the day when they are not
busy with other tasks such as answering the phone, writing thank-you letters to
doctors, and sending questionnaires to new patients. Other offices may have a full-
time employee who handles legal depositions and second-opinion cases in which
the doctor is paid to give a legal opinion of someone’s medical condition.
In small offices, you will not see as many employees as noted in the larger of-
fices just discussed. In a small office, one or two employees may handle all the tasks
identified. You can readily see how busy a medical office can be, regardless of
whether it is a large or small office.
Front office staff skills needed in a small office include
a. Every employee, regardless of job duty, needs to know how to keyboard
accurately.
b. Every employee needs to know how to maneuver around a medical software
package to make appointments, reschedule, and cancel appointments.
c. Every employee needs to have a pleasant speaking voice that is courteous and
cheerful whether the patient is in front of him or her at the office or being spo-
ken with over the phone.
d. Every employee needs to have good handwriting so that employees in the other
departments, or the doctors themselves, can read and understand their notes
or questions.
e. Every employee needs good listening skills to hear and understand what the
patient is saying, or what the doctor is saying, or what is being said over the
phone line.

f. In a small office, several people need to know how to operate the switchboard.
In a large office, several people need to rotate their job positions to include
time at the switchboard. For example, to account for breaks during the day,
vacations, or time off. In this age of technology, some offices have only an an-
swering machine that records the information from each patient who calls.The
directions on the answering machine instruct the caller about what informa-
tion to leave and to expect a return call in answer to any requests or other
needs at a particular time.
g. All personnel must maintain a professional decorum and avoid discussing pa-
tients’ names and medical problems in front of other patients. This is in com-
pliance with HIPAA rules. Other rules and regulations will be discussed later
in the chapter.

FIGURE 6 • Encounter form.
h. Several people need to know how to handle money when the patient pays a co-
pay or coinsurance charge. This is needed for people who check in patients as
well as those who check out patients. The encounter form (see Figure 6) notes
if a patient had x-rays taken that day or an injection given. If so, additional
money may need to be collected from the patient at the time of checking out.
i. Every employee needs to know how to verify insurance coverage over the In-
ternet or by speaking to a customer service representative of an insurance com-
pany. They can also determine deductible amounts to collect as well as a
mailing address where each claim should be sent.
j. Every employee needs to treat all patients with dignity and courtesy. Some-
times that is difficult, because some people are in great distress and they may
not be very pleasant to deal with.
552

Working in a Medical Office
k. Every employee should ensure that all the information keyed into the medical
software such as social security number and insurance subscriber number are
correct.
l. Every employee should know how to file charts and find charts as well as
know where charts may be if they are not in the main files.
m. Every staff member must wear washed and pressed uniforms or appropriate
office clothing to promote an air of professionalism among patients and
coworkers. Good grooming is necessary for everyone.
n. It is expected that medical office personnel understand some general medical
vocabulary pertaining to their particular area of interest or specialty.
o. Everyone must realize the importance of confidentiality regarding every pa-
tient’s health problems. This is also a HIPAA rule.
BILLING STAFF
Without this department collecting the money from insurance companies and,
at times from patients, there would be no medical office. The goal of the billing
department is to send out claims with no errors and receive payments from in-
surance companies in a timely manner. That does not always happen because
people make mistakes. Front office employees may have keyed incorrect data,
and until the claim is denied, it is not discovered and corrected. At times patients
do not give the doctor the correct insurance information, either. They may for-
get to mention that the injury is due to an auto accident or an accident on the
job. Many times insurance companies know this ahead of time, and if a medical
office attempts to receive payment from the health insurance first instead of
from the auto insurer or from workers’ compensation, they will always deny
payment.
Billing employees need to know Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes
and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) diagnosis codes. They also
need to know how to do both electronic (if the volume justifies the cost) and pa-
per claims. Each insurance company has its own identification numbers, doctor
identification number, and peculiarities as to what they will allow on the
electronic forms.
Insurance companies make contracts with doctors as to how much they will
allow for each procedure no matter what the doctor charges. Payments that are
posted to patient accounts must be adjusted with this in mind, and this is a task of
one of the billing employees. Daily denials sent to doctors’ offices from insurance
companies must be individually reviewed to discover why the claim was denied.
Phone calls must be made to insurance companies when claims remain unpaid to
determine how to remedy the problem. Sometimes this can be done through the
Internet because all insurance companies have Web sites. However, every insurance
company has its own policy for allowing members or doctors’ offices to obtain
classified information about individual medical claims. (This, too, is part of
HIPAA rules.) The medical office is usually required to get a password to use their
Web site.
Statements are also sent monthly to patients who have a balance left on their
account and payment is requested. If a payment is not sent, stronger notices are
sent. After a designated period, if the balance has not been paid, notices are sent
to the patient that the claim is being sent to a collection agency or an attorney.
Many patients ignore these notices, but not paying will affect their credit rating
eventually.

Working in a Medical Office
Quick Tips
• In registering and orienting patients, request patients who are
new to the office to sign a privacy notice that is required by
federal law (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996 [HIPAA]).
• Congress passed HIPAA, in part, to improve the efficiency of
the nation’s health care system. In brief, the Act
• requires that insurance claims be submitted electronically
by computer.
• changed how the claims are coded.
• required the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) to make rules for patient privacy and computer
security that health care facilities must follow.
• To learn more, search on the Web for HIPAA.
Billing staff skills needed include the following:
a. Every billing employee needs to know how to use a medical software package
to make appointments, reschedule, or cancel appointments.
b. In addition, the billing employee must be able to interpret data and charges
recorded to a patient’s account to communicate both verbally or in writing the
charges, payments, and amount owed by the patient if there is a balance.
c. Each employee needs to know medical terms, medical procedures done in that
particular office, as well as the diagnosis codes required for payment by an in-
surance company. It is vital in communicating with a patient, whether in per-
son or on the phone, to understand what was done for the patient on a
particular office visit in question.
d. Each employee needs to document in the medical software package the details
of every conversation with a patient or an insurance company representative.
The representative’s name and phone number should also be recorded for fu-
ture reviews or contacts.
e. Each employee needs excellent telephone etiquette when attempting to explain
to an irate patient why he or she received a statement.
f. Each member needs to demonstrate a spirit of teamwork with each member in
the department as well as with co-workers from other areas in the practice.
g. Personal grooming is just as vital to the employees in this department as in any
other department of a medical practice, because one can be called upon to see
a patient up front almost every working day.
h. Several billing employees need to know how to send claims to insurance com-
panies electronically.
i. Charts are pulled every day from the main filing area, and each billing em-
ployee is responsible for returning them to their proper place.
j. As in every other department within a medical practice, confidentiality is of vi-
tal importance regarding patient accounts.

Key Terms
Appointment card. The card given to a
patient indicating the date and time
of the next appointment.
Co-payments (co-pays). This charge is
assigned by the insurance company
to every subscriber or individual
when he or she sees a doctor or
dentist. The amount to pay is
printed on the insurance card, but
not all co-pays are printed on the
card. Sometimes there are special
co-pays for injections and for x-
rays. Anyone with an insurance
card can call his or her insurance
company and get this information.
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT). This
book, written and approved by the
American Medical Association, gives
a numeric five-digit code (ICD-9) for
everything a doctor does. For
example, it covers office visits,
injections, x-rays, and surgeries. This
book is used in all fifty states and
every insurance company recognizes
the codes. The codes are printed on
an HCFA form for reimbursement
from insurance companies. Whether
a claim is printed on paper or sent
electronically, every procedure must
be coded. If a patient had an x-ray,
the procedure code would tell the
insurance company what body part
was x-rayed. See also International
Classification of Diseases (ICD-9).
Deductible. Many people have health
insurance policies that allow them
to go to any doctor they want to
see. They are not limited to certain
doctors on a list mailed to them by
their insurance carrier. These people
usually have a deductible they must
meet before their insurance pays the
health provider. For example, some
people have to pay $500 annually
before the insurance company pays.
Other people have to pay $1,000 or
$2,500 before the insurance
company pays anything. Insurance
companies will pay a portion, but
the subscriber or patient pays most
of it until it is met annually.
Encounter form. A sheet from which
the doctors write down what they
performed for the patient that is
billable. For example, did the
doctor request x-rays, was a cast
put on someone’s arm, did the
patient get an injection?
Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA). Guarantees
that health insurance coverage is
available to workers and their
families when they change or lose
their jobs. The 1996 law was
expanded to include, among other
things, the privacy of confidential
personal health care information.
This part of the law went into effect
April 14, 2003.
Health maintenance organization
(HMO). Some individuals or groups of
employees enroll for insurance with
a company in which there is a co-
pay every time the insured sees a
doctor within the plan. They also
receive prescription benefits. HMOs
are usually offered to people of all
ages. This means that retirees can be
in an HMO as well as people in the
workforce. The drawback is that the
insured person can see only doctors
who take that particular insurance.
Insurance companies mail new
HMO plan subscribers a list of
doctors from whom to choose their
care. For subscribers who need to
see a specialist, they must first
contact their primary care physician
556

Working in a Medical Office
and have a referral sent to the
specialist’s office before they can be
seen. Without the referral, the
patient pays full price for the visit or
is turned away and must reschedule
the visit. With the referral, the
patient pays just a small co-pay.
International Classification of Diseases
(ICD-9). Every procedure needs a
diagnosis code. These diagnosis
codes are found in another
international classification of
diseases book called the CPT book.
For example, if a doctor saw a
patient, there was a reason for the
visit. Was the reason that the
patient had a cold? If so, the
diagnosis could be congestion in the
head, sore throat, or fever.
Practice. The term referring to the
professional business of the doctor
and medical staff work; for example,
the medical practice of Dr. Jones.
Preferred provider organization
(PPO). Individuals or groups of
employees can enroll in a PPO
policy. Whereas individuals or
groups of people with an HMO
policy can see only doctors who
take their insurance, people with
PPO policies may see any doctor
without restriction. Subscribers
usually have an annual deductible
in addition to co-pays or
coinsurance amounts depending on
the medical service provided.
Primary care physician. Sometimes
referred to as a PCP, this family or
internal medicine doctor
recommends patients to specialists
where needed. PCPs are often 
called gatekeepers. A PCP may
have a contract with an insurance
company such as Blue Cross 
HMO, Aetna HMO, Humana
HMO, or AvMed HMO to see
patients who have enrolled in that
particular insurance and any 
other insurance companies 
with whom the doctor has a
contract. Insurance companies 
pay the PCP X amount of dollars
each month to see X number 
of patients.
Referral. A form typically issued by
the primary care physician to
approve a specialty medical service.

Enter your responses after each situation.
1. Vicki likes to talk more than work, and lately, she
discovered she now has health problems. Laurie,
who works with Vicki, feels sorry for Vicki and does
some of her work. This then puts her under pressure
to get her own work done, and Laurie never quite
gets caught up. Laurie then feels stressed, but still
allows Vicki to put more and more work on her. In
fact, other people in the office have noticed this and
also dump more work on Laurie.
What would you suggest Laurie do? What would
you tell Vicki? What would you tell their supervisor?
2. Patti and Jeff work in the same office. Over a period
of time, their friendship has bloomed into a romance.
Although they work in different departments of the
medical practice, you have seen them holding hands
in the back offices.
If Patti or Jeff were your personal friend, what
could or should be done? If you were the
supervisor, what would you do?
3. Mrs. Jones is a pampered patient. The doctor always
sees her because she demands it. Her husband is also
a doctor, so she is given preferential treatment. She
phoned last week and made an appointment to see
the doctor in two weeks. Today she decides she can’t
wait that long and walks into the waiting room filled
with patients, demanding to see the doctor right
away. She displays a temper tantrum, and the doctor
concedes and sees Mrs. Jones.
If you were a patient in the waiting room, how
would you feel? Would you vent to the person
behind the front desk even though it is out of his or
her control?
If you were the supervisor of the medical
office, what would you do?
d. General comments on the type of medical
office, how the office has changed since the
HIPAA law has taken effect, how each office
does specific tasks, and one interesting story
shared with you from the office staff.
e. Your comments on whether these visits helped
you decide if you want to work in a medical
environment.
2. Imagine you have an opportunity to interview a
medical front office assistant about his or her job.
With a partner, brainstorm a list of questions to ask
related to his or her tasks and skills. Be prepared to
share your findings in class.
3. Phone your insurance company or go online and
find out what are your health insurance benefits.
Find the effective date of your policy, and check to
see if you have a PPO or HMO policy. (The letters
PPO or HMO are usually printed on the insurance
card.) Also find out what your co-pay is when
you visit your family doctor versus a visit to a spe-
cialist. Check with an insurance company represen-
tative (probably by phone) to see if you have
an annual deductible and, if so, what the amount is.
How much of your deductible has been met already?
When would you need to know this information?
Share general information that resulted in your
telephone interview to let your instructor know you
completed this activity.
5. Write a thank-you letter to primary care physician 
Dr. Ella Jones, 123 Main Street, Anywhere, US
12345–0000.Thank Dr.Jones for referring Dana Perry
to your specialty clinic; tell Dr. Jones that the patient,
who complained of shoulder pain, was indeed diag-
nosed correctly by her; and that Dana has been advised
to have shoulder surgery at her earliest convenience.
6. Type a memo to the staff from Dr. Jones with today’s
date on it. The subject is: Employee of the Month.
The memo should mention that the doctors are in-
stituting this award starting today. Every employee
will have a chance to nominate someone during
the current month and to list reasons why this em-
ployee should be honored on the attached nomina-
tion sheet. Mention that the person awarded will
have his or her name printed on a brass plaque hung
in the waiting room. In addition, the monthly award
includes a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of the
winner’s choice.The winner will be announced at the
beginning of the following month in another memo.
Last, state that at the end of the year, a special award
will be given to the Employee of the Year, selected
from the award winners of the previous months.The
winner will receive an all-expenses-paid weekend
cruise for two.
Then create a nomination sheet to attach to the
memo.Allow enough space for employees to list rea-

4. A patient comes to a medical office from the emer-
gency room of a local hospital. The emergency
room staff gave this patient an aluminum splint for
his finger and told him to follow up with a visit to
an orthopedic doctor.After the doctor sees the x-rays,
the doctor decides that the aluminum splint is not
going to heal the patient’s finger properly and puts
a Staxx splint on the patient’s finger. The patient is
enraged and refuses to pay for another splint.
As he leaves the office, he mentions to you that
he isn’t going to wear the new splint. Based on the
information he provided to you, what would you do?
Using the Web: Research Activities Applications
A. Select a medical office position (for example, medical
receptionist,
billing/coding,
insurance specialist).
Complete the following steps:
1.
Research at least three job opportunities for the
desired office position in your geographical area.
In a table, compare the descriptions for similari-
ties and differences. Be sure to include the refer-

Rule 25: Choose Who or Whom
One quick way to test the use of who or whom is to re-
member that who is always used as the subject of a sen-
tence; therefore, it will be followed by a verb, and whom
is used as the object of the sentence or the object of a
preposition.
Incorrect: Mr. Martin is the manager whom was
promoted last month.
Correct: Mr. Martin is the manager who was pro-
moted last month.
Notice the verb following who in the first sentence.
This verb signals the pronoun must be who because it is
the subject of the verb was.
Incorrect: Mr. Riley was the one who we thought
might have been promoted.
Correct: Mr. Riley was the one whom we thought
might have been promoted.
Notice we is the subject, thought is the verb, and
whom is the object of have been promoted.
When all else fails, look for the verb directly follow-
ing who or whom; if there is a verb choose who. If there
is not a verb, choose whom.

Working in a Legal Office
Introduction to the Legal Office
Have you thought about working in a law office? Attorneys (or lawyers, as they
are often called) hire office professionals in several capacities—receptionist, legal
secretary, paralegal (legal assistant), librarian, researcher, transcriber, and finan-
cial and records control. Many of these positions provide opportunities for you to
use the office skills you already have and to further enhance these skills as well.
Do you think the roles of the office professionals in the legal field have changed at
all over the years? Let’s look at these positions and the roles they play in the legal
field. See Figure 1.
A receptionist in a law firm has a very responsible position. He or she is often
the first contact the public has with the law firm—either by telephone or in person.
In addition to greeting the clients, prospective clients, and other visitors, the recep-
tionist may also be assigned other duties such as proofreading, collating materials,
and processing the mail.
A legal secretary performs tasks similar to most secretaries in offices. How-
ever, in a legal office the secretary performs tasks that demand knowledge of legal
document preparation as well as court procedures. We will discuss this in more
depth later in the chapter.
A paralegal is another name for a legal assistant. A legal assistant works under
the supervision of an attorney and provides services such as researching cases,
drafting legal documents, conducting initial client in-
terviews, discovery, investigations, and other duties as
prescribed by the supervising attorney. The paralegal’s
duties vary according to the type of law the attorney
practices.
A librarian is in charge of the library and is usually
found at a large law firm or in a corporate setting where
there is a resource center that contains a large volume of
legal books, legal software programs, and multimedia
equipment. Skills in filing and finding materials are
needed for this position. In addition, the librarian often
contributes to research and helps the legal staff with
appropriate multimedia solutions for cases.
A legal researcher is more likely to work in a very
large law firm or in a corporate research center. A
researcher’s skills must be highly developed to be able
to find information and research topics that pertain to
various cases quickly and efficiently.
A legal transcriber transcribes recorded dictation
from an electronic or manual recorder. Knowing the
legal format and terminology as well as being
proficient in a word processing program is necessary.
In addition, excellent grammar, spelling, punctuation,
capitalization, and proofreading skills are required to
progress in this position. See Figure 2.
The financial and records control staff usually
are those who process payroll and taxes, and keep
other financial records. These positions require good
attention to detail as well as solid accounting and
recordkeeping skills.

Working in a Legal Office
The role of office professional has broadened to
include a wider range of new responsibilities than it
formerly included. It now may include training,
orientation, and supervision of new assistants; com-
pleting research; operating and troubleshooting of-
fice technologies; and managing the office entirely.
Other duties include collecting, processing, storing,
retrieving, and interpreting information to distribute
to other staff and clients.
Legal employees perform a variety of administra-
tive and clerical duties, such as managing infor-
mation, scheduling meetings and appointments,
conducting court research, and providing information
via the telephone, postal mail, e-mail, fax, and in per-
son. They often prepare correspondence, make travel
arrangements, and answer the telephone. In addition,
many are asked to log in documents at the courts.
Legal secretaries use computers to prepare legal
papers, such as complaints, notices, motions, re-
sponses, subpoenas, and other documents, under the
supervision of an attorney or paralegal. Think about
the law offices in your area. You have probably seen
law firms that are owned by one lawyer (a sole pro-
prietorship), those that are owned by two or more
lawyers (a partnership), and perhaps you have seen
law offices in large corporations or various institu-
tions (such as the military) in your city or town. Each
size of office, of course, has varied numbers of
employees. Likewise, the duties performed by the staff
will vary. In a small office, one or two legal employees handle all the work of the
attorney. As the firm’s size increases, the jobs and duties become more specialized.
Now, let’s focus on legal careers and training. Have you thought about what
skills you will need to work in a law office and how much competition for jobs
there may be?
Legal Secretarial or Assistant Careers
According to the U. S. Government’s 2008–2009 Occupational Outlook Handbook
there were 275,000 legal secretaries employed in the United States during that
period. The handbook projected a 12 percent growth from 2008 to 2016. The future
employment figures look promising. What type of training and qualifications do you
think these legal secretaries needed?
TRAINING AND QUALIFICATIONS
Most legal secretaries have at least a high school diploma, with many having a
college education and advanced degrees in business, psychology, or education.
Employers look for legal assistants or secretaries who have good interpersonal
skills, discretion, good judgment, organizational or managerial ability, initiative,
good grooming, a pleasant personality, and the ability to work independently or
FIGURE 2 • Legal office assistant proofreading a legal

as a team member. One requirement that most employers stress is confidentiality.
You will have access to information about many people and companies. This in-
formation is not to be divulged outside the office environment. You may also learn
about awards, promotions, or other topics that pertain to the office staff. This is
also confidential until you are told differently.
In addition, employers want employees with a high degree of skill in tasks
related to the legal office, such as keyboarding; use of electronic equipment; Internet
research ability; and skills in punctuation, capitalization, proofreading, and editing.
Employers in some law firms prefer office professionals who have certification in
some area of secretarial or legal expertise. What certifications are available?
Types of Certification
Legal assistants, secretaries, researchers, and other workers may become certified
through the International Association of Administrative Professionals (IAAP) or
the National Association of Legal Secretaries (NALS). Certification such as the
Certified Professional Secretary (CPS) or the Certified Administrative Professional
(CAP) can be attained by meeting the educational requirements and passing the
required examinations though IAAP.With one year of legal experience or the com-
pletion of an approved training course, a person can acquire the basic designation
of Accredited Legal Secretary (ALS) through the testing process offered through
NALS. NALS also offers the designation of Professional Legal Secretary (PLS), an
advanced certification for legal support professionals.
For advanced certification, a person can obtain the Certified Legal Secretary
Specialist (CLSS) offered by Legal Secretaries International in civil law, real
estate, probate, criminal law, intellectual law, and business law after the com-
pletion of five years of law-related experience and the successful passing of the
examination.
You can earn a paralegal certificate from a number of public and private
schools that offer these programs. Usually a paralegal program lasts for six months
to a year and consists of various courses in law and other subjects.The courses you
are taking now should help prepare you for initial job entry as a receptionist or
legal secretary; completing a paralegal certificate program will also give you a
competitive edge.

As you think about increasing your qualifications through advanced education and
training, take a moment to reflect on the employment picture in the legal field.
SECRETARIAL OPENINGS AND CHANGES 
IN THE WORK ENVIRONMENT
Legal secretarial openings are expected to increase over the next few years, although
many lawyers are performing their own administrative services that were formerly
the domain of the legal secretary. In addition, many law firms now employ one or
more paralegals who are assuming more of the duties formerly relegated to secre-
taries. However, you will find employment opportunities are available in most towns
and cities in both large and small firms. Review these advertisements that were
featured recently in the classified ad section of a local newspaper.All of these ads are
taken from one daily paper. Jobs are available for those who have the skills and
competencies required. See Figure 3.
As you reviewed the advertisements for legal positions, what did you think about
the duties specified in the ads?You probably noticed that a variety of tasks were listed
along with the requirements for computer literacy and use of word processing pro-
grams, such as Word and Excel. You can expect these requirements will be standard
for most legal positions. In addition, you probably noticed a variety of tasks relating

to the type of practice: civil litigation, workers’ compensation, and bankruptcy. The
duties you assume will also be relative to the size of the practice as well as to the spe-
cialization of the workforce in the legal practice. Note that lawyers, like doctors, have
a law practice. Practice is a term used to designate the professional business or law
firm. An attorney (lawyer) practices law or owns a law practice.
Technology will play a large role in the work that you do. As one attorney
stated, the biggest changes in the law profession today are in the technology used
and how employees spend their time. Now, instead of spending time in libraries,
law professionals (attorneys or assistants) are Internet research specialists. Parale-
gals along with librarians now handle much of the research for the attorneys.They
must understand legal terminology and have good research and investigative
skills, and be able to do legal research using a computer and the Internet.They also
need to stay abreast of new developments in the laws that affect their area of
expertise. The most common way many legal assistants expand their knowledge is
by participating in continuing legal education seminars.
You probably noticed the ads discussed earlier frequently mentioned the need
for experience with technology. Dictation equipment is frequently used, so you
should be familiar with using a dictation system as well. Being able to place and
receive calls on the newest telephone systems will also be a plus.
Frequently Processed Documents
The legal employee will almost always come into contact with some types of legal
documents. Because business transactions often involve participants from other
areas of the country, you will likely be responsible for processing documents
according to the laws of different states as well as the federal government. You
must be familiar with a number of uniform statutes (laws), one of which is the
Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Most business documents will conform to the
UCC. Let’s discuss briefly a few of the documents that you may be required to key
and process. Your duties in the initial development of these instruments with
clients will depend on your expertise and the degree of freedom the attorney
affords you. Naturally, the more experience you have, the more involvement you
may have in the preparation of the document contents.
CONTRACTS
A contract is usually a written, but sometimes an oral, agreement between two or
more parties to do, or not do, an act; which results in the agreement being
enforceable in a court of law. It is a binding legal agreement. Some contracts that
must be in writing are for
• the purchase of real estate;
• time periods that are more than a year;
• promise to leave something to someone in a will;
• the sale of goods of $500 or more (with four exceptions).
As the legal employee responsible for keying the contract, you will check to be sure
it has the following information:
1. Date and place of the agreement.
2. Names of the parties.
570

Working in a Legal Office
3. Duties of the parties.
4. Statement of the consideration (money, services, goods) in payment for
the contract.
5. Time involved.
6. Signatures of the parties.
Your responsibility in keying the document is to make sure that you have
keyed all the necessary elements correctly to facilitate its legality. To be valid and
enforceable, contracts must be within the law. Illegal contracts are not enforceable
and have no legal effect. In some instances, a minor error, or typographical omis-
sion, may make the document null and void. You must be extra careful to avoid
typos or minor errors. They may not be minor in the legal world!
Contract forms can be purchased at an office supply store (see Figure 4), but
often contracts need to be customized for the particular parties and the situation

involved. As a member of the law firm staff, you may also become a party to con-
tracts such as when you ask for a repair order, complete a purchase order, outsource
work to agencies, or make a purchase or other agreement as part of the law firm’s
needs. You should be cautious when you make any of these agreements for the law
firm to execute because these agreements can become binding once signed by an
executive or representative of the firm.
BANKRUPTCIES
This discussion concerning bankruptcies is general. Because of the economic situa-
tion in today’s business world, bankruptcy laws are constantly changing. An office
professional’s job would be to assist the attorney, but would not be expected to
know bankruptcy law.
Bankruptcy is a legal process that allows a debtor (one who owes a debt) to
have assets converted into cash to be distributed among creditors (persons or
companies owed), after which the debtor is given a discharge from all debts that
have unpaid balances. Bankruptcy proceedings can be initiated by the debtor (vol-
untary bankruptcy) or by the creditors filing a petition (involuntary bankruptcy).
Only a federal court can handle bankruptcy proceedings. A trustee in bankruptcy
is appointed by the court to hold the debtor’s assets in trust for the benefit of the
creditors. An individual or a business can be bankrupt. You are more likely to hear
about a business being bankrupt because this often affects the community in terms
of employment and taxation.
The Federal Bankruptcy Code provides for five types of bankruptcy proceedings,
such as
• Chapter 7—liquidation;
• Chapter 9—municipalities;
• Chapter 11—business organization;
• Chapter 12—family farmers;
• Chapter 13—adjustment of debts of individuals.
You and your firm may be involved in any of the proceedings, depending on the
cases accepted by the firm. Your responsibilities will be dictated by the attorneys
for whom you work and how much participation they want from the staff. You
will likely key some of the documents, and you must be sure that names, addresses,
dates, and dollar amounts are absolutely correct.
WILLS
You may have clients who hire your law firm to provide services relating to estate
planning. Estate planning describes the area of law dealing with the disposition of
a person’s property after death so the property can be disposed of to the heirs
according to the person’s wishes. One such service would be that of drawing up a
last will and testament. A will is an instrument that a person uses to dispose of
property upon death. The person who makes the will is called testator (if a man)
or testatrix (if a woman). A person who benefits from the will or receives a gift
under the will is a beneficiary. Testate is a term that refers to the state of a person
who has made a will. Intestate means the person died without a will.
After you have keyed the will for the client and the attorney has verified its
accuracy, the client is asked to sign the will in the presence of witnesses who attest
572

Working in a Legal Office
to the testator’s or testatrix’s signature. The witnesses subscribe or write below or
beneath the testator’s signature. All but three states in the United States require
two witnesses to a will. Louisiana requires two plus a notary public; Vermont
requires three. Pennsylvania has no witness requirement unless the testator signed
by mark.
You may be responsible for knowing the requirements for witnesses in your state
and for securing the correct information once the will is ready to be signed.You may
also be involved in working with a living will—a document used to allow a person
to die a natural death without heroic or artificial means used to keep the person alive.
Another instrument you may be asked to prepare is the durable power of
attorney, which authorizes another person to act on someone’s behalf usually if he
or she becomes incapacitated.
A codicil changes a will in some way (usually minor ways, as opposed to writ-
ing a new will) and must be signed and witnessed just as the original will. Any of
these instruments should be placed for the witnesses to sign with only the signa-
ture area of the will visible to thwart the chance reading of the contents of the will
by the witnesses. They are only attesting to the signature and to the sound mind
of the testator (testatrix) and not to the contents of the will.
PETITIONS
A petition is a document or instrument that contains a formal request for some
action or request for something to be done or not done. If you are responsible for
drafting petitions, ensure that they are drafted in a respectful tone and with clear,
concise language.The names of the persons who are making the request are stated,
along with the explanations of why the request is being made. The reasons are
usually stated in the petition in their order of importance. In California, for ex-
ample, a written application for a court order that begins the process for divorce
is called a petition.
AFFIDAVITS
An affidavit is a written statement sworn to under oath that the facts are true
according to the person’s belief, information, and knowledge. The person making
this statement is known as the affiant and makes this statement under oath to a
judge, notary public, or other public officer.
You will likely be asked to draft affidavits for most legal documents that you
prepare. Your responsibility will be to check the accuracy of the document to be
sure that the information included is correct. See Figure 5.
POWER OF ATTORNEY
A power of attorney is a document that authorizes someone to act for another—the
principal (one in control). The employer may give the legal assistant or secretary a
power of attorney to sign checks, to make certain purchases, or perform other acts
deemed appropriate. The power of attorney may be made for a certain period, for
an indefinite period, or for a special purpose. Only those who have proven their
trustworthiness are given these special privileges granted by a power of attorney.
Sometimes a client may need to revoke (rescind or call back) a power of attorney.
A revocation is used for this purpose.

Document Preparation
Some of the responsibilities you will assume as you prepare these documents or par-
ticipate in their preparation have already been discussed. Should you work in a small
office, you will likely also key the documents as well as do other tasks involving the
legal formatting of these instruments. These tasks will include, but are not limited to,
considering the paper size,type font and size,number of copies,format (margins,head-
ings, spacing), citations, stapling and folding, page numbering, dates, and number
treatment (including dollar amounts). You will also be responsible for any names and
574

Working in a Legal Office
signature areas being properly placed, any seals that should be affixed, and, believe it
or not, the final proofing of the document. We will discuss each of these briefly.
PAPER SIZE
Legal documents can be purchased from an office supply store, as mentioned
earlier, or keyed on a computer and printed at the law office. The paper used is
white (see the will in Figure 6), either 8 1/2  11 inches or 8 1/2  13 or 14 inches.
Although legal cap (paper with pre-printed ruled margins) is still used
occasionally, courts do not require it and regular white bond paper is usually used.
As the person responsible for keying documents, you should determine the
requirements of the court in which the documents will be filed.
TYPE FONT AND SIZE
In most cases, a good font is used such as Times Roman 12-point or another read-
able type font and size. Consult with your office staff or attorney to determine
what type font and size are appropriate for the documents you prepare. In most
instances you will not use italic or script except for special wording.
NUMBER OF COPIES
Today, copies are made with the computer and printer or the photocopier. Multi-
ple copies are usually required so that every party gets a copy and the attorneys
also get a copy. A file copy is made so that it can be kept in your law firm’s files.
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT
STATE OF GEORGIA
COUNTY OF DEKALB
I, JIM RAY THOMAS, JR., a legal resident of said State and County, do
make and publish this my Last Will and Testament, hereby revoking any
prior testamentary dispositions by me, as follows:
ITEM I
(a) I wish my body buried in a suitable manner and a suitable memorial
erected and the cost thereof paid out of my estate.
(b) All of my just debts and any unpaid charitable pledges, whether such
pledges are legally enforceable or not, shall be paid out of my estate as
soon as practicable.
ITEM II
I give, devise, and bequeath all of the property that I may own or in
which I may have an interest, real, personal, tangible, intangible, or mixed,
and wherever situated, to my wife, SANDIE SUE THOMAS.
ITEM III
I constitute and appoint my attorney, JOHN L. BAILY, 340 North
Building, Atlanta, Georgia 30304 as Executor of this Will and should he
1
FIGURE 6 • Last will and testament on page 1.
575

Working in a Legal Office
Your task likely would be to ensure that all copies are properly signed and all
procedures for witnesses, filing of the document, or distribution of copies have
been followed.
FORMAT
If using ruled paper, the margins are designed for you on the paper. Usually the left
margin is approximately 1 1/2 inches with at least a 1/2-inch right margin. The top
margin is usually 2 inches on the first page and 1 1/2 inches on the succeeding
pages. The bottom margin is normally about 1 inch. Most legal documents are
double-spaced. You should check with the attorney for whom you work to deter-
mine any variations in the format for the documents you key.
CITATIONS
Courts often specify the manner in which court cases are to be
referenced or cited in legal documents. Ask your attorney or an-
other legal professional to help you with any citations that you
are not sure of or find confusing.
STAPLING AND FOLDING
Legal papers are usually protected by a legal back, within which
the document is stapled (usually at the top). Legal backs are often
blue or brown paper. If no back is required, you should staple the
document as if it were in a back. Avoid removing a document
from a legal back after it has been stapled because this could void
or make the document invalid. Documents are often folded in
thirds or fourths to fit the backing so that the wording on the
backing is visible on the outside fold, as shown in Figure 7. Verify
with the attorney what information should be keyed on the legal
back.
PAGE NUMBERS
Drafts should be numbered and labeled as requested or required
by your attorney. Many attorneys require that drafts be labeled,
such as “First draft” and then the date. Always number the first
and last page of documents unless the attorney gives you other
directions.
DATES
Date every legal document. Verify with the attorney or office staff
exactly how you should key dates, whether they should be keyed
in all words or numbers, or in some other way. Examples of styles
are as follows:
the sixth day of December, two thousand twelve
the 16th day of December 2012
16 December 2012

NUMBER TREATMENT
Documents that have numbers with any legal significance, such as money or time
periods, are usually written both in words and numbers. Again, verify how your
office keys these numbers such as
Five Thousand (5,000) Dollars, $5,000, or Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000)
Five Thousand Two Hundred and 50/100 Dollars ($5,200.50)
Thirty (30) days
NAMES AND SIGNATURES
If you know the names of the individuals to sign the document, go ahead and key
them the way they usually use their names. If you don’t know, then use their legal
names. Again, verify with the attorney how the names should be keyed. Some
people use nicknames, abbreviations, or aliases. Also, some people are acting in
trust or as agents for others. In stating names, you need to be very precise and use
the name the client chooses to use.
SEALS
Some documents have seals placed on them and some require only the initials L. S.
for locus sigilli, meaning “in place of the seal.” This is usually placed at the end of
the line where the parties sign their names to the document.
PROOFREADING
Proofreading is always your responsibility! If you are weak in grammar, spelling,
punctuation, or capitalization skills, take the initiative to upgrade your skills. You
may do this independently by obtaining a few business English textbooks or an
office reference manual. Another way to upgrade your skills is to take a grammar
course at a local college. Proofreading is a necessary skill. You should be able to
identify any errors that you have made by carefully checking the copy against the
original or by reading over the document line by line, concentrating on each word.
If you find that you still have problems finding your errors, have someone partner
with you. One person will read the original while the other reads the revision. If
the document is new, then have the partner proof the document for you. What
should you be checking as you proof?
Verify the accuracy of all names, dates, places, dollars, specifications (like land
measurements), or other information that appears in the document and is signifi-
cant to the legality of the document. Although your computer spell checker may
find some errors, do not depend on it. Spell check may find spelling errors but it will
not usually locate word choice errors such as too for two or affect for effect. Do not
let something go by because you are hurried. Making an error in a document could
cost your firm the case for your client or cause a client to bring a lawsuit for mal-
practice against the firm.The best advice is: Ask if you don’t understand something!
INFORMATION FOR THE DOCUMENTS
How will you receive the instructions to prepare these documents? You may
receive the information in a number of ways, again depending on your experience.
If you are new to the workforce, the attorney may assign you to a seasoned assis-
tant to mentor you (to partner with you as you learn). That mentor may get the
information from the attorney and then assign all of it or parts of it for you to
577

Working in a Legal Office
complete under his or her supervision. You will follow your mentor’s lead in
getting the material ready for signature or for the attorney to approve.
Another way you may receive the information is for the attorney to give you
the documents with the information handwritten for you to complete. This is often
the way forms are handled. The attorney may also dictate the information to you
as you key, or ask you to write the information as he or she dictates it to you.
Dictation equipment has moved into the digital age. Dictation is now
recorded on a tiny hard drive within the recorder. The day of the cassette tapes
are fast going the way of the VCR cassettes. This new digital recording media is
exactly the same as having your music collection on an iPod rather than a stack
of CDs.
An attorney who is in the middle of dictating and remembers something of
importance, such as a point he or she needs to tell the assistant, can pause the first
dictation job and open a new dictation job to dictate those instructions. When the
instructions have be dictated, the attorney can return to the first project. The
attorney can dictate trial notes at the close of the day in court and transfer them to
the office from home or hotel over the Internet for transcribing. This online “deliv-
ery” of dictation to the office for transcription is a huge time-saving advantage for
the attorney.Another way you may receive the dictation is through the use of voice-
recognition technology. See Figure 8. The attorney may use voice-recognition
(speech-recognition) software, dictate the legal documents, and then ask you to
make any corrections or changes needed to the already keyed document. The use
of voice-recognition software is becoming a trend in many professions, including
the legal and medical.
Once you have achieved a bit of experience, the attorney may just tell you to
prepare a particular document for certain clients, and you will know exactly what
to do. When that time comes, you will certainly feel proud to be a legal assistant
or secretary. Good luck as you continue to get ready for your legal career by
completing the exercises that follow.

ETHICS AND THE LEGAL ASSISTANT
The very nature of the type of work completed in an attorney’s office demands high
ethical standards on the part of the legal professional. The National Association of
Legal Assistants (NALA) has identified ten canons by which all members of their
association are bound. See Figure 9. These standards exemplify the conduct re-
quired not only of every member of NALS but of all legal professionals everywhere.
NALA Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility
Each NALA member agrees to follow the canons of the NALA Code of Ethics and Professional
Responsibility Violations of the Code may result in cancellation of membership. First adopted by the
NALA membership in May of 1975, the Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility is the foun-
dation of ethical practices of paralegals in the legal community.
A paralegal must adhere strictly to the accepted standards of legal ethics and to the general
principles of proper conduct. The performance of the duties of the paralegal shall be governed by
specific canons as defined herein so that justice will be served and goals of the profession attained.
(See Model Standards and Guidelines for Utilization of Legal Assistants, Section II.)
The canons of ethics set forth hereafter are adopted by the National Association of Legal Assistants,
Inc., as a general guide intended to aid paralegals and attorneys. The enumeration of these rules
does not mean there are not others of equal importance although not specifically mentioned. Court
rules, agency rules and statutes must be taken into consideration when interpreting the canons.
Definition: Legal assistants, also known as paralegals, are a distinguishable group of persons who
assist attorneys in the delivery of legal services.Through formal education, training and experience,
legal assistants have knowledge and expertise regarding the legal system and substantive and pro-
cedural law which qualify them to do work of a legal nature under the supervision of an attorney.
In 2001, NALA members also adopted the ABA definition of a legal assistant/paralegal, as follows:
A legal assistant or paralegal is a person qualified by education, training or work experience who
is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity
who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible.
(Adopted by the ABA in 1997)
Canon 1
A paralegal must not perform any of the duties that attorneys only may perform nor take any actions
that attorneys may not take.
Canon 2
A paralegal may perform any task which is properly delegated and supervised by an attorney, as
long as the attorney is ultimately responsible to the client, maintains a direct relationship with the
client, and assumes professional responsibility for the work product.
Canon 3
A paralegal must not: (a) engage in, encourage, or contribute to any act which could constitute the
unauthorized practice of law; and (b) establish attorney-client relationships, set fees, give legal
opinions or advice or represent a client before a court or agency unless so authorized by that court
or agency; and (c) engage in conduct or take any action which would assist or involve the attorney

Working in a Legal Office
Canon 4
A paralegal must use discretion and professional judgment commensurate with knowledge and
experience but must not render independent legal judgment in place of an attorney. The services
of an attorney are essential in the public interest whenever such legal judgment is required.
Canon 5
A paralegal must disclose his or her status as a paralegal at the outset of any professional rela-
tionship with a client, attorney, a court or administrative agency or personnel thereof, or a member
of the general public. A paralegal must act prudently in determining the extent to which a client
may be assisted without the presence of an attorney.
Canon 6
A paralegal must strive to maintain integrity and a high degree of competency through education
and training with respect to professional responsibility, local rules and practice, and through
continuing education in substantive areas of law to better assist the legal profession in fulfilling its
duty to provide legal service.
Canon 7
A paralegal must protect the confidences of a client and must not violate any rule or statute now
in effect or hereafter enacted controlling the doctrine of privileged communications between a
client and an attorney.
Canon 8
A paralegal must disclose to his or her employer or prospective employer any pre-existing client or
personal relationship that may conflict with the interests of the employer or prospective employer
and/or their clients.
Canon 9
A paralegal must do all other things incidental, necessary, or expedient for the attainment of the
ethics and responsibilities as defined by statute or rule of court.
Canon 10
A paralegal’s conduct is guided by bar associations’ codes of professional responsibility and rules
of professional conduct.

Working in a Legal Office
Concept Review and Reinforcement
Review of Key Concepts
OUTCOME
CONCEPT
1. Discuss the positions
that may be available 
in a law firm.
A legal office can provide a variety of employment opportunities for beginners and
those seeking a career in a legal field. You may start as a receptionist or legal secretary
and look for advanced training. You may decide to train as a paralegal, librarian,
or legal researcher. If you like to work with records and money, a position in the 
financial office of a law firm may be just the thing for you.
2. Explain how the role 
of office professionals
has changed.
The role of office professionals has broadened to include a wider range of new 
responsibilities than it formerly included. Many office professionals now provide
training, orientation, and supervision for new assistants; do research; operate and
troubleshoot office technologies; and manage the office entirely.
3. Describe the types of
certification available.
Types of certifications include Certified Professional Secretary (CPS), Certified 
Administrative Professional (CAP), Accredited Legal Secretary (ALS), and Certified
Legal Secretary Specialist (CLSS).
4. Identify employment
opportunities.
According to the U.S. Government’s 2008–2009 Occupational Outlook Handbook,
there were 275,000 legal secretaries employed in the United States during that 
period. The handbook projected a 12 percent growth from 2008–2016. The future
employment figures look promising.
5. Describe frequently
processed documents.
Contracts. A contract is usually a written, but sometimes an oral, agreement between
two or more parties to do, or not do, an act; which results in the agreement being
enforceable in a court of law. It is a binding legal agreement.
Bankruptcies. A legal process that allows a debtor (one who owes a debt) to have as-
sets converted into cash to be distributed among creditors (persons or companies owed),
after which the debtor is given a discharge from all debts that have unpaid balances.
Wills. An instrument that a person uses to dispose of property upon death.
Petitions. A document or instrument that contains a formal request for some action or
request for something to be done or not done.
Affidavit. A written statement sworn to under oath that the facts are true
according to the person’s belief, information, and knowledge.
Powers of attorney. A document that authorizes someone to act for another—the
principal (one in control).
6. Describe the basics 
of legal document
preparation.
Preparing documents requires an office professional to consider the paper size
needed, type font and size, number of copies, format, citations, stapling and folding,
page numbering, dates, number usage, names and signatures, seals, and proofreading.
7. Discuss how you 
may increase your
proofreading ability.
•
Upgrade your grammar, spelling, punctuation, or capitalization skills.
•
Take classes in grammar at a community college.
•
Have someone partner with you with one reading the draft and the other reading
the original.
8. Discuss the importance
of high ethical
standards required 
of legal professionals.
A paralegal must adhere strictly to the accepted standards of legal ethics and to the
general principles of proper conduct. The performance of the duties of the paralegal
shall be governed by specific canons such as those defined by NALA so that justice
will be served and goals of the profession attained.

Enter your responses after each situation.
1. Divulging confidential information. You and the legal
secretary who supervises your work have met for
lunch in a café that is frequented by several of your
clients. She asks you if you have heard the rumor that
one of the clients who has been in the office is being
arrested for fraud.You are sitting near several tables of
people, and she has asked this in a rather loud voice.
What will you do? Will you answer the question and
discuss this situation? What will you do, if anything,
about the other table hearing what was asked?
2. Maintaining high ethical standards. Your law firm is
handling a rather messy divorce proceeding for one
of the leading politicians in a race for mayor of the
town in which you live.A reporter comes into the of-
fice and asks you on the sly to give him details of the
divorce. He tells you that you will not be mentioned
in the newspaper report he is preparing. What will
you do?
3. Keeping confidential information confidential. Your
firm awards a member of the staff every six months
with an award and a check for $100 to spend at a
local store in the mall. The award is highly confi-
dential until it is announced at a staff meeting. You
know who will get the award because you have
processed the paperwork for the check. One of the
employees comes to you and asks if she is getting the
award so that she can be sure to be at the staff
Building Your Office Skills
Exploring the Workplace: Activities
1. Betty, one of the new paralegals, comes to your desk
and asks for the phone number and address of one of
the clients. She needs to contact the person to come
in this afternoon for a meeting, and she needs to have
a paper delivered to her home before the client comes
to the office. She asks you to also locate the telephone
number of a courier to deliver the paper.What should
you do with these requests? Are they urgent? Decide
how you would handle this situation and write a
brief paragraph to submit to your instructor for
feedback.
2. Make an appointment with a law office in your
area to interview the legal secretaries who work
there. Indicate that your instructor has mentioned
that this particular law firm (the instructor gives
you the firm’s name) would like to talk with students
who are interested in the legal profession. During
your visit, ask questions about the job functions of
the legal secretaries, the training they have received,
the type of equipment and technologies they use,
and how they see a career as a legal secretary chang-
ing. Report your findings in a two-page, double-
spaced information report. In the report mention
the following:
a. The name of the firm and its address.
b. Names of persons you interviewed and their
official titles.
c. General comments on the appearance of the
office, the parking, the landscaping, the lighting,
the work space for each person, the library 
(or other source of legal books), and at least
one interesting story the interviewees may have
shared with you.
d. Comments on whether you have decided on a
legal career for your future.
3. Ms. Brown, your attorney in a small office, dictates
a letter to you to send out under her signature to a
client who has not returned the documents she was
to review. The deadline for filing the document with
the court is fast approaching—in fact, it is next Fri-
day. Write the letter. What should the letter contain?
How will you send the letter? What information will
you need to include in the letter? Where will you
locate the needed information? Write step-by-step
instructions on how you will handle this situation
and submit it to your instructor.
4. The lead attorney in the office asks you to key a memo
to all the staff reminding them of the fire drill that will
take place unannounced sometime next week. It will
be monitored by the local fire department personnel.
The law firm was notified of the drill but was not told
the date or time. The fire department wants to be sure
that the building can be evacuated in case of an emer-
gency. Draft the memo for your attorney to approve.
What should you include in the memo? Provide a copy
of the memo for your instructor.

joining the local paralegal association if there is one in
your city or town. She asks you to research this infor-
mation on the Internet and locate the nearest chapter
and any requirements for membership, including cost
of joining. Submit the information to your instructor.
2. Mr. Johnson, the founding partner of your law firm,
has a friend in another city that he has lost touch
with but wants to locate. He knows his name and he
thinks he knows the hometown of the lawyer friend.
He asks you to locate the information for him. How
would you do this?
3. You and the other legal employees in the firm believe
there are newer versions of the voice-recognition soft-
ware available from at least one of the leading mak-
ers of voice-recognition software. Surf the Internet
and find which makers have updated versions and the
specifications of each version you find. Report the in-
formation in an Excel spreadsheet or in a table using
Word that compares the specifications of each ver-
sion. Be sure to identify the name of the product, its
cost, its manufacturer, and how it can be obtained.
Submit the report to your instructor.
4. You are so excited about the law profession that you
would like to take the Law School Admissions Test
(LSAT) and attend law school. Surf the Internet to
learn about this exam, how much it costs, where you
can take it, and any other information that you can
find. Submit the information in a one-page informa-
tion report to your instructor.

Be sure to follow these steps after you complete the
tasks:
• Proofread each document.
• Check your document for spelling, grammar, and
punctuation.
• Verify the spell-checker found all the errors.
• Finish the To-Do list by completing the time log
portion for each task and submit it with the activities.
• If submitting the documents electronically, save the
activities as lastname-P6T1, for Part VI Task 1. For
example, kirkland-P6T1, which would identify the
first task completed under Part VI.
• Follow your instructor's steps to submit the activities.
• With the help of a team member or your instructor,
select the best activities representative of your work
from the Integrated Project to be included in your
portfolio.
Task 1: Searching the Internet
for HIPAA Medical Forms
Task 1 According to the American Hospital Association’s
statement on The Patient’s Bill of Rights, all patients have
the right to have their personal privacy respected and
their medical information handled with confidentiality.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) ensures that personal patient information
remains private and secure. A medical office assistant
must be trained in HIPAA rules as they pertain to
greeting patients, handling the preliminary paperwork
for patients, and filing patient information.
Your Task To gain knowledge about the HIPAA rules as
they relate to medical forms used by a medical office
assistant, you are to search the Internet for HIPAA
medical forms, particularly the ones that relate to the
receptionist area. For example, search for at least three
of the following:
• Medical Sign-In Sheet (or search for Privacy Sign-In
Sheets)
• Medical Patient Registration Forms
• Notice of Privacy
• Patient Acknowledgment
• Patient Disclosure
• Patient Record Access
• Patient Complaint
If you can download samples, print them, and submit
them with a memo written to your instructor. In your
memo, provide the URL of each Web site and a
description of each form. Also, include the benefit you
received by completing this task.
Task 2: Creating a list
of Legal Research Web sites
Task 1 Because our legal system is based on the law of
precedents, a great deal of an attorney’s time involves
research. In order to prepare a client’s case, the attorney
must reference previous cases. A legal assistant may be
called upon to complete the research using the attorney’s
law library, which must be kept current, or using the
Internet. He or she must be familiar with legal
terminology and the location of where to find
information.
Your Task To improve your efficiency in finding
information available on the Internet, you are to create
a list of URLs you will use most often. You are to locate
on the Internet the exact Web site for the following list
of law-related Web pages. Write a memo to your
instructor; use a table giving the name of the Web page,
its description, and its corresponding URL. Use the copy
and paste feature in Word to avoid errors in the URLs
which are often difficult to key.

Preparing to Meet the Challenges
W
hat does the future hold for you? With the development and application of
technology in the office, there is a greater need for professionally trained
office professionals such as office managers, administrative assistants,
information specialists, receptionists, record technicians, and mailroom assistants.
The computer, with the development of new software programs, provides the
tool that allows today’s office professionals to broaden the scope of their jobs.
Today’s office professionals must be able to implement the systems needed to
process information, for no organization can compete in today’s global market
without having the information it needs when it needs it. Office professionals will
be expected to use technology effectively and possess personal qualities and inter-
personal skills necessary to become productive members of the team.
This chapter focuses on strategies for advancement and ways to continue to
develop professionally.
Eliminate Stereotypes
The attitude that someone is “just a secretary” has no place in the contemporary
office. This stereotype developed at a time when women were encouraged to “just
get a job.” It was perceived that serious positions in the workforce should be held
by men, since men were to be providers for the family.
This scenario is, of course, no longer accurate or valid. The stereotype of an
office worker who typed, filed, did only routine tasks, and was too emotional has
been replaced by a new bold and professional image.
PROFESSIONAL IMAGE
A professional image reflects:
• an educated and skilled employee;
• a team player who is expected to contribute valuable ideas;
• a polished individual whose appearance and communication style are 
“professional”;
• a person who can solve problems and integrate ideas;
• a person who takes pride in each piece of work he or she produces;
• an employee who works for the betterment of the organization and is not 
self-serving;
• a person who takes pride in the career of office administration and who has
aspirations for the future;
• an employee who manages assignments by applying quality standards;
• an employee who is willing to work hard and accept new and more challenging
responsibilities.
The best way to eliminate the stereotypical view is for men and women in this
professional to initiate the change themselves. By living up to the professional
image of an administrative assistant, they will replace the old stereotype.
The best way to develop the professional image of an administrative assis-
tant is to
1. set short- and long-term career goals that are obtainable.
2. develop desired strategies for achieving these goals.
3. set timelines for each step in the strategies.
4. begin to carry out the steps immediately.
594

Preparing to Meet the Challenges
Prepare for Advancement
An office professional often can take paths leading to other careers, including ones
that involve supervision and management. Therefore, office professionals should
prepare themselves mentally for advancement and for greater challenges and re-
sponsibilities. Following are a number of strategies for preparing for advancement.
LEARN FROM YOUR PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL
As soon as you are employed, your goal will shift from getting a job to holding it.
The organization that hired you expects you to be a productive worker and to
improve as you gain experience on the job.
Most organizations have policies about evaluating employees’ job perfor-
mance, but the way in which employees are evaluated varies from organization to
organization. The review for evaluating employees’ past job performance is called
a performance appraisal. Completing a performance appraisal allows opportunities
for you and your supervisor to discuss your past accomplishments and areas for im-
provement in the future. You can anticipate a performance appraisal within the first
three to six months and at least once a year after that.Although you may be asked to
complete a rating sheet on yourself,your manager may complete a rating sheet as well.
During the meeting about your performance, you are entitled to ask questions
and to discuss your contributions to the organization. At some point during the
meeting, your manager may suggest specific ways to improve your performance.
Listen carefully, for you are being given guidelines concerning what is expected of
you. You should be aware that in addition to telling you how you are doing, what
is expected of you, and ways to improve your performance, your manager is trying
to build mutual confidence and trust and to reinforce the values of the organization.
From the first day on the job, keep notes on your performance, noting particu-
larly how your production has increased and ways in which you are accepting more
responsibility. Let your manager know you have a professional development plan,
and you are seeking ways in which to grow. Maintain an impeccable performance
record and refer to your notes when you are evaluating your own performance.
When you are comfortably settled in your first job, your initial reaction may
be to take it easy. Don’t coast. Many opportunities for advancement are available,
but advancement comes only to those who are prepared.
Stop ’n Check 1
1. Rate yourself on the following two common performance factors. Use the rating scale of 4 (Exceptional), 3 (Commendable),
2 (Improvement Recommended), and 1 (Unsatisfactory).
a. ________ Quality of work—accuracy, completeness, and orderliness
b. ________ Punctuality—adheres to work schedule; is prompt in notifying supervisor of tardiness or absence; submits work in a
timely manner
2. If you received a Commendable rating on these two factors and believed you should have received an Exceptional rating, how would
you respond to your supervisor? What would you say? What documentation or examples do you have to present?

Preparing to Meet the Challenges
SET GOALS
You learned ways to exhibit self-management, which included goal setting. If you
haven’t already set a professional goal for yourself, do so. For example, do you
want to become an executive assistant, a supervisor of office staff, a records man-
ager, or a manager of office administrative services? Once you have decided on
your goal, study to provide yourself with the background necessary to achieve that
goal. Once you achieve that goal, set another.
To accomplish your goals, you may need support and resources from man-
agement. If so, select a person in management on whom you can rely for assistance
and with whom you can develop a mentor relationship. To set your goals, keep
these steps in mind:
• Write down your goals and review them frequently. For example, enroll in a
management class.
• List your goals in action terms. Answer the question: What do I need to do? 
Inquire about a management class? Enroll in a class?
• Identify your goals in measurable terms. Ask yourself: How will I know I met
this goal? Completed the course? Yes? No?
ADAPT TO CHANGE
You learned that the challenge of change presents opportunities to grow. When
change occurs, identify negative feelings and learn to deal with them by rearrang-
ing your priorities and working positively to make adjustments. Keep a positive
attitude because it helps you to channel your energies into improving your situa-
tion.
Unexpected situations can occur that influence your goals and their achieve-
ment. Sometimes situations occur that interfere with your achieving your goals,
such as the reorganization of your department. When forces beyond your control
interfere with achievement of your goals, take time to reevaluate your plan. Ask
yourself: Are my goals realistic? Are my goals appropriate for me? Do my goals
need to be changed or even postponed? To handle unexpected situations, you must
remain positive and flexible.
Creativity and flexibility are needed in organizations today. Companies re-
quire their staff to “do more with less.”This means that effective managers realize

Preparing to Meet the Challenges
problems often cannot be solved by using the same old methods. Today’s office
workers must have an attitude that allows for recognition and acceptance of new
ideas and new ways of solving problems and getting results.
It is a fact that people resist change if they perceive the change, such as new
procedures, updated equipment, change in management, or a different work
schedule, as a threat. Often office workers resist change because management did
not effectively communicate the change. Keep in mind that effective communica-
tion is the key to introducing change. See Figure 1.
When you encounter resistance to change, remember that keeping a positive
attitude allows you to be more open to taking steps to improve the situation. Look
for opportunities that might come your way as a result of the change.
GAIN ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
To be an effective office professional, you must be clear about what you want from
your position and be willing to make it happen. If you have identified your pro-
fessional goals, then you are well on your way. It is a fact, though, that people need
responsibility to be motivated on their jobs. To keep up your enthusiasm, you can
be a tremendous help to your manager by taking the initiative to ask for respon-
sibilities that he or she might otherwise have to handle.
When asking for additional responsibility, remind your manager of your suc-
cess in handling a particular task or project in the past where you required little
or no instruction. For instance, Sylvia asked her manager if he would like her to
take the lead in organizing the annual company picnic. Although this activity was
team led and Sylvia’s manager was the chair of the team, he had a number of tasks
to be completed prior to the team’s involvement. In asking for additional respon-
sibility, Sylvia reminded her manager she had successfully completed a project
similar to this one. By gaining additional responsibility, Sylvia has many oppor-
tunities to demonstrate her level of initiative not only to her manager but to other
coworkers as well.

INCREASE YOUR EFFECTIVENESS
Make your supervisor look good. This means meeting deadlines, being willing to
do “extras,” making your work look more professional and polished, and being
informed so that your supervisor is never caught off guard.
• Ask questions to learn the“why”behind what goes on in the daily office routine.
• Ask for frequent feedback on your work, mention special contributions you
have made to the team, and inform your manager about any courses you are
taking or additional training you would like to have.
• Understand, accept, and respect the chain of command in your organization.
• Remain loyal to your own values, your manager, and the organization. It helps
your professional image if you do not make negative remarks about either your
manager or the organization—its employees, policies, products, or
services.
LEARN FROM A MENTOR
Mentors are people in your profession who are more senior than
you. They understand the organization’s policies, procedures, poli-
tics, and history, and they are willing to share useful advice with
more junior members. They help people who are new to the organi-
zation or the profession to become successful. The mentor relation-
ship often involves a new employee and an office veteran (Figure 2).
The new employee may have strong state-of-the-art technical skills,
but the mentor knows the organization’s culture.
Meetings with mentors and the information they share is confi-
dential because a mentor’s advice is intended to show a junior mem-
ber shortcuts to success. Mentors welcome the questions of junior
staff members and see it as their responsibility to nurture younger
people with potential for success.
A mentor has to be a person with whom you feel comfortable and
who is pleased to answer your questions. The mentor has to consider

the advice he or she gives you as confidential. In addition, the mentor has to be
someone who has the answers to your questions about
• how the organization works;
• how information flows in the office;
• ways to avoid unnecessary conflict;
• how the organization selects people for promotion;
• who holds the power to decision making;
• how to get your ideas noticed and accepted.
Before you ask someone to become your mentor, think about the characteristics
you would like to see in a mentor. For example, think of the role models in your
organization. Who has a strong work ethic, years of experience, job expertise,
personal warmth, and respect?
How Do You Select a Mentor?
Once you have identified the desired characteristics, you may ask someone to
become your mentor. Or, you may ask one of the following to help you identify a
mentor:
• Human Resources Department representative;
• team member;
• manager;
• coworker.
DEVELOP YOUR LEADERSHIP QUALITIES

the skill of leading the performance, two entirely different skills. You do not have
to be a supervisor or manager to lead; as an office professional, you can learn to be
a leader—one who can
• influence others to do their very best;
• help others to accept challenges even when they believe they cannot handle them;
• inspire confidence.
Beyond competence, which means a person is knowledgeable in the areas rel-
evant to his or her organization’s success, here are other qualities to help identify
whether you are capable of developing the skill of leading.
• Integrity. Show consistency between words and actions; choose the more diffi-
cult right over the easier wrong; admit mistakes; consistently support standards.
• Vision. Support the vision for your organization, department, or unit; show a
strong sense of direction.
• Effectiveness. Focus on results versus tasks and techniques; build on strengths,
not on weaknesses.
• Passionate commitment. Demonstrate high enthusiasm and energy levels, feel the
thrill of challenge, persevere from start to finish, create enthusiasm and desire to
excel among others, and inspire others to work at their highest level.
• Communication. Congratulate, thank, and acknowledge people who are dis-
playing behaviors that support the organization’s values; speak positively about
policies and procedures; show others they are important by following up with
those coworkers who receive promotions, graduate with degrees, are ill, are
having children, or are getting married.
This list of qualities may look familiar. Because these skills and personal qual-
ities are critical to developing the skill to lead, it is important for you to focus on
them again in this section.
CROSS-TRAIN
Cross-training involves learning and performing the responsibilities of your
coworkers. It is valuable to the organization. When one employee is absent from
work, other employees can simply fill in. However, it has even greater benefits to
the person who has the initiative to learn how to perform other people’s jobs. The
more you know and the more you gain additional skills, the more valuable you
will be to the organization.

Preparing to Meet the Challenges
The office assistant who is preparing for advancement, or who just wants to
protect the security of his or her current job, should learn as many skills and gather
as much information as possible.
Cross-training gives the office professional the opportunity to
• take on new technical and communication challenges;
• learn more about the organization and the flow of work;
• get more exposure by working with new people;
• get acknowledgment from management.
Cross-trained employees are more challenged, more knowledgeable, more
interesting, and generally happier.
GATHER INFORMATION
To prepare for advancement, monitor your changing environment by gathering
information. Here are a number of suggestions:
• Subscribe to and read professional magazines.
• Listen to motivational or informational tapes while you travel to and from work.
• Read office bulletins and newsletters to remain up to date on corporate matters.
• Attend seminars, conventions, conferences, and workshops to keep abreast of
new technology and procedures.
• Volunteer to be a committee member or chairperson for special events.
• Apply or offer to work on special task forces.
• Request that you be placed on the office circulation list for all information and
professional materials.
• Make a point of meeting new people and listening to their ideas.

Preparing to Meet the Challenges
Commit to Your Values and Ethics
Values and ethics are central to any organization. Throughout the chapters, ethi-
cal issues have been discussed. Let’s take a closer look at values.
VALUES
Values can be defined as those things that are important to or valued by someone.
That someone can be an individual or, collectively, an organization. When values are
shared by all members of an organization, they are extraordinarily important tools
for making judgments, assessing probable outcomes of contemplated actions, and
choosing among alternatives.Perhaps more importantly,they put all employees on the
same level with regard to what all employees as an organization consider important.
Values are what people judge to be right. They are more than words—they are
the moral, ethical, and professional attributes of character. These are not the only
values that should determine your character, but they are ones that are central to
your profession and should guide you as an employee in your organization.
Values are the embodiment of what an organization stands for and should be the
basis for the behavior of its employees. However, what if employees of the organi-
zation do not share and have not internalized the organization’s values? Obviously,
a disconnect between individual and organizational values will be dysfunctional.
Additionally, an organization may publish one set of values, perhaps in an effort to
push forward a positive image, whereas the values that really guide organizational
behavior are very different.
So, there are some disconnects, and these disconnects create problems. However,
the central purpose of values remains. They state either an actual or an idealized
set of criteria for evaluating options and deciding what is appropriate, based on a
number of things, such as experience.
ETHICS
So how do values relate to ethics? Individually or organizationally, values deter-
mine what is right and what is wrong, and doing what is right or wrong is what is
meant by ethics. To behave ethically is to behave in a manner consistent with what
is right or moral. Part of the difficulty in deciding whether or not behavior is eth-
ical is in determining what is right or wrong.
What does “generally considered to be right” mean? All one needs to do is to
look at the positive values of society and the organizations one belongs to, and
what is right or wrong should be evident. Obviously, it’s not so easy.
Most of your ethical development occurs before entering an organization. The
influence of family, church, community, and school will determine your individual
values. The organization, to a large extent, is dealing with individuals whose value
base has been established. This might imply that ethical organizations are those
fortunate enough to bring in ethical individuals, whereas unethical organizations
• Read the local newspaper to follow community and international events.
• Travel to as many locations as possible.
• Visit libraries and note the many resources available.
• Become aware of your company’s policies.
• Make a point to watch documentaries on television and read or study new topics.
602

Preparing to Meet the Challenges
brought in unethical people. But it is not that simple. While the internalized values
of individuals are important, the organization has a major impact on the behavior of
its members and can have a positive or negative influence on their values.Staying com-
mitted to your values increases your satisfaction with your decisions and their results.
How can you help to create an ethical climate? Be certain your pattern of behav-
ior aligns with your own values as well as your organization’s values. Increase your
awareness of how to apply your organization’s code of conduct. Through additional
training, learn how to deal with situations with an ethical dimension and how to
anticipate situations that involve your values and ultimately ethical choices.
Continue to Develop Professionally
As you read this chapter, you may conclude that preparation for a successful career
is endless. Your conclusion is right.
Continue to increase both your general knowledge of office procedures and
your special skills. The ability to relate well to customers, clients, and coworkers
is essential. A working knowledge of computers software is essential. Computer
technology and software are changing at a rapid pace. Develop an affinity for new
equipment and learn the new applications.
To advance in your career, you need a broad general education. An understand-
ing of how to deal with all types of people and business and management concepts
is a valuable asset. Organizations are looking for employees who are critical thinkers
and problem solvers.
If you wish to advance professionally, make decisions and carry them out.
Then take responsibility for both your successes and failures. Procrastination and
the inability to make decisions will be viewed as weaknesses and will prevent
opportunities for promotion.
WHAT TODAY’S OFFICE REQUIRES
To plan for your future professional development, you should understand what
the contemporary office requires. Professionals in the contemporary office will
• supervise people in nontraditional work styles that include flexible working
hours in flexible locations;
• use the most current office technology and high-tech communication;
• rely almost exclusively on the office network and the Internet to access and
manage information;
• make greater productivity their primary focus;
• work effectively with people from diverse age groups and cultural and religious
backgrounds.
Professionals who continue to develop their knowledge and skills do so by ad-
vancing their education, joining professional associations, and becoming certified
in their technical skills.
ADVANCE THROUGH EDUCATION
A college degree is useful in advancing to a higher-level office position. In fact, any
additional education will prove helpful. When you have an efficient and effective
performance record, additional education may provide the competitive edge you
need to advance (Figure 3).
603

Preparing to Meet the Challenges
Many organizations offer in-house training. The courses usually are of short
duration and do not offer college credit. Talk with your supervisor or training di-
rector about what is available. Express an interest in taking courses that will help
you perform your job or advance in your career. When you successfully complete
enough courses, they will become an impressive part of your employment record
and will support your efforts toward advancement.
Most large organizations have educational benefits. Some organizations will
pay all or part of the tuition for job-related courses that are successfully com-
pleted. Ask your Human Resources representative about the educational benefits;
express your interest in taking job-related courses. Consider courses in these areas:
FIGURE 3 • Education is essential in advancing your career.

conflict resolution
communication
organizational behavior

The emphasis in education today is on continuing education. By committing your-
self to lifelong learning, you will be increasing your opportunities for promotion and
enriching your personal life.Employees who believe and practice continuous education
are more likely to survive during periods of company reorganization and recession.
As an office assistant, you choose either to have a job or to have a professional
career. If you have a strong desire to advance and to earn a reputation for being a
professional who contributes to the organization, you will seek ways to achieve
professional recognition.
JOIN A PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION
Becoming a member of a professional association is an excellent way to gain edu-
cational skills and new credentials in your field.A number of associations promote
professionalism, such as Association of Records Managers and Administrators

BECOME TECHNICALLY CERTIFIED
Technical skills are some of the most highly valued skills of office professionals. By
continuing to upgrade technical skills, office professionals can improve their resumes
and increase their opportunities for employment and advancement. To validate tech-
nical skills, office professionals should earn certification from recognized programs.
In addition to the certifications offered by many professional organizations, one of
the most recognized software certifications is the Microsoft® Certified Application
Specialist (MCAS) program.
The MCAS credential validates skills in using 2007 Microsoft® Office System
and the Windows Vista operating system, meeting the demand for the most up-to-
date skills on the latest Microsoft® technologies. For more information, contact
Microsoft® at http://office.microsoft.com.
TAKE ACTION
If your supervisor supports professional development activities, you may be able
to take advantage of a number of workshops, seminars, and conferences. To be
proactive, consider the results of your performance appraisal, interests, and addi-
tional knowledge and skills you would like to develop. Evaluate each of these areas
to determine your priorities. Once you have identified your priorities, then rank
them as 1, 2, 3, and so on. Focus on your first priority by applying the steps you
have learned to meet stated goals. Doing so will help you stay on track to develop
your professional image.
As you complete your professional development activities, be sure to keep a
log of your activities and keep your completion certificates in a folder or notebook
for future use. For instance, you can refer to this information during your next
performance appraisal or update your resume using this information.
Professional growth is stimulating; it has a motivating effect. If you continue to
apply strategies for advancement and look for professional development opportu-
nities, your reward will be a successful and enjoyable career, not “just” a job.

Rule 24: Plural and Possessive Form of Words
When you are uncertain about the plural form of a word,
consult a dictionary. The plurals of hyphenated or spaced
compounds are formed by pluralizing the main element
of the compound; for example, the rule for pluralizing
editor in chief is editors in chief, and more than one letter
of credit would be letters of credit.
Capital letters and abbreviations ending with capital
letters are pluralized by adding s alone. Here are a few ex-
amples: three VIPs, HMOs, and PTAs.
When the first element of a compound is a
possessive, simply pluralize the final element. For in-
stance, proofreader’s mark would be written as proof-
reader’s marks and visitor’s parking permit would be
shown as visitor’s parking permits.
