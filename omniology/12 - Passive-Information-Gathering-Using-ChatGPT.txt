PASSIVE INFORMATION
GATHERING USING CHATGPT
Passive information
gathering involves
discreetly observing
and collecting data
without alerting
potential targets.
It's essential to operate within legal and ethical
boundaries, focusing on publicly accessible
information and respecting privacy to maintain
ethical standards in cybersecurity endeavors.
Crafting queries that appear innocuous while
extracting valuable information is a skill that
can be honed with ChatGPT.
