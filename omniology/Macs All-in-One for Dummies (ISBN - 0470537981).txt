About the Author
Joe Hutsko is the author of Green Gadgets For Dummies. Joe lives in Ocean 
City, New Jersey and blogs about green gadgets for the Green Inc. section of 
The New York Times. For more than two decades, he has written about com­
puters, gadgets, video games, trends, and high-tech movers and shakers for 
numerous publications and Web sites, including Macworld, PC World, Fortune, 
Newsweek, Popular Science, TV Guide, The Washington Post, Wired, Gamespot, 
MSNBC, and Salon.com. You can find links to Joe’s stories on his tech blog, 
JOEyGADGET.com.
As a kid, Joe built a shortwave radio, played with electronic project kits, and 
learned the basics of the BASIC programming language on his first computer, 
the Commodore Vic 20. In his teens, he picked strawberries to buy his first 
Apple II computer. Four years after that purchase (in 1984), he wound up 
working for Apple, where he became the personal technology guru for the 
company’s chairman and CEO. Joe left Apple in 1988 to become a writer and 
worked on and off for other high-tech companies, including Steve Jobs’ one-
time NeXT. He authored a number of video game strategy guides, including 
the bestsellers Donkey Kong Country Game Secrets: The Unauthorized Edition, 
and Rebel Assault: The Official Insiders Guide.
Joe’s first novel, The Deal, was published in 1999, and he recently rereleased 
a trade paperback edition of it with a new foreword by the author (tinyurl.
com/hutskodeal).

Dedication
This book is dedicated to three men. 
The first two men — Steven P. Jobs and Steve Wozniack — founded Apple, 
for which millions of other Mac (and iPhone, iPod, and other Apple-created 
products) users and I are enormously grateful.
The third man is John Sculley, former Apple Chairman and CEO. I worked for 
John from 1984 to 1988 in a dream job role as his personal technology advi­
sor. Those were great-thinking times John, and I’d work with you again in a 
New York minute.

Author’s Acknowledgments
This (my second For Dummies) book wouldn’t have my name on its cover if 
my literary agent, Carole Jelen, hadn’t reached out on LinkedIn.com a few 
summers ago to say hello after we had fallen out of contact since meeting in 
the 1980s, when I was working at Apple. Thank you, Carole, for pitching me to 
Wiley acquisition editor Bob Woerner — and thank you, Bob, for saying yes!
Kudos to copy editor Brian Walls for helping me mind my words, grammati­
cally speaking.
Special thanks to Keri Walker of Apple for her always friendly support when 
it comes to all things Apple products, and to Khyati Shah, for helping me get 
(and stay) in sync with MobileMe — a many splendored thing!
Super-duper thanks to my good ol’ friend Barbara Boyd, for helping me pull 
off many of the chapters in this book that featured collaborative applica­
tions or uses, such as iChat, networking, and a dozen or so others. Thanks, 
Barbara, for your lifelong friendship, and your “always present” presence — 
you may live in Rome, but you’re never more than a heartbeat away.
Major thanks to every one of my ever-encouraging dear friends, especially 
Drew Davidson, and to Ric Firmino, David Unruh, David Baron, my cousin 
Chip McDermott, my brothers Steve and John, and my sister, Janice, and 
last but never least, my close friend and Monday Night Supper slinging mom, 
Frances Hutsko.
I’m deeply indebted to eight close friends whose generous support and faith 
made this book possible (literally!): Susan Godfrey (a.k.a. “E.P.”), Lisa Napoli, 
Linda Williams, Randee Mia Berman, Val Petrosian, Katherine Etzel and 
Robert Pascale, and my aforementioned mom.
Finally, I’m once again enormously grateful for having the incredibly good for­
tune of being assigned to project editor Nicole Sholly, for her gently worded 
yet enormously intelligent guidance, brilliant organization, incisive editing, 
well-honed instinct, and, above all, tremendous wit and generous sense of 
humor. Nicole was my editor on Green Gadgets For Dummies, and on this 
mammoth doorstopper of a tome she proved once more to be this author’s 
dream-come-true editor as we worked together to turn the seven minibooks 
of the first edition of this title into the eight newly updated and revised mini­
books you’re holding in your hands (or reading on your Kindle). Thank you, 
Nicole.

Introduction
W
hether you’re a beginner, an intermediate user, or a seasoned 
computer expert, you can find something in Macs All-in-One For 
Dummies, 2nd Edition, for you. This book is divided into eight minibooks 
so you can focus on the topics that interest you and skip over the ones that 
don’t. Eventually, you might want more detailed explanations on specific 
topics than this book can provide — that’s when you should look into a 
more specialized For Dummies book. But if you need a quick introduction to 
get you started on a smorgasbord of topics related to using a Mac, this book 
can answer your questions, steer you in the right direction, and lead you 
gently on your way. 
About This Book
This book focuses on the basics for all the aspects of using a Mac, from 
turning it on and using the mouse to connecting your Mac in a network to 
organizing your digital pictures and videos to create photo albums and 
home movies with fancy captivating special effects to . . . you get the idea.
This book also shows you how to use and take advantage of Apple’s iWork 
suite, which provides a word processing and desktop publishing program, a 
presentation program, and a spreadsheet program for calculating formulas 
and displaying your data as 3D charts. Whether you use a Mac for work, 
school, or just for fun, you’ll find that, with the right software applications, 
your Mac can meet all your computing needs. 
If you’re migrating to a Mac from a Windows desktop or notebook PC, this 
book can show you how to install Windows on your Mac so you can run 
your favorite Windows programs. By running Windows on a Mac, you can 
turn your Mac into two computers for the price of one.
If you’re new to the Mac, you’ll find this book introduces you to all the main 
features of your Mac. If you’re already a Mac user, you’ll find information 
on topics you might not know much about. After reading this book, you’ll 
have the foundation and confidence to move on to more advanced books, or 
delve deeper into your Mac’s bundled applications and others you can buy 
by experimenting on your own.

Foolish Assumptions
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I made a few assumptions about you, dear reader. To 
make sure we’re on the same page, I assume that:
	
✦	 You know something, but not necessarily a whole lot, about computers 
and you want to find out the basics of using a Mac or doing more with 
your Mac than you are already.
	
✦	 You have at least a general concept of this wild and crazy thing called 
the Internet, or more accurately, the phenomena known as the Web.
	
✦	 You’ll turn to the introductory chapters if you find yourself scratching 
your head at such terms as double-click, drag and drop, and Control-click — 
or any other terms that sound like things I think you should know but you 
don’t.
	
✦	 You appreciate the speed at which technology-based products like the 
Mac and the programs you can run on it can change in as little as a few 
months, with newer, sleeker, faster models and application versions 
replacing previous versions.
	
✦	 You acknowledge that it’s up to you to go on the Web to find updated 
information about the products described throughout this book.
	
✦	 You know that keeping up with the topic of all things high-tech and Mac 
(even as a full-time job, as it is for me) still can’t make a guy the be-all 
and end-all Mac Genius of the World. You will, therefore, alert me to cool 
stuff you discover in your Mac odyssey so that I can consider including 
it in the next edition of this book.
	
✦	 You’re here to have fun, or at least try to have fun, as you dive into The 
Wonderful World of Mac.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book efficiently, I use a few style conventions:
	
✦	 Terms or words that I truly want to emphasize are italicized (and 
defined).
	
✦	 Web site addresses, or URLs, are shown in a special monofont typeface, 
like this.
	
✦	 Numbered steps that you need to follow and characters you need to 
type are set in bold.
	
✦	 Control-click means to hold the Control key and click the mouse. If 
you’re using a mouse that has a left and right button, you can right-click 
instead of Control-click.

How This Book Is Organized
What You Don’t Have to Read
You don’t have to read anything that doesn’t pertain to what you’re interested 
in. In fact, you can even skip one or more chapters entirely. I hope you don’t 
skip too many, though, because I think some of the chapters you think you 
might not be interested in might surprise you and be interesting after all.
That said, if you’re absolutely, totally, one-hundred percent new to comput­
ers, I suggest you read (or at least scan) the first part, and then move on to 
the parts you’re interested in reading in any order you want.
As for the occasional sidebar you encounter in this book, feel free to ignore 
them because they contain, for the most part, tangential thoughts, miniature 
essays, or otherwise forgettable blathering that you’re just as likely to forget 
anyway after you read them. Ditto for any of the text you see alongside the 
Technical Stuff icon.
How This Book Is Organized
Don’t be afraid of this book because of its hefty bulk. You won’t necessarily 
need (or want) to read this whole thing from cover to cover, and that’s fine. 
Think of this book more as a reference along the lines of an encyclopedia 
or a dictionary than step-by-step operating instructions that require you to 
read every page.
To help you find just the information you need, this book is divided into 
eight minibooks where each minibook tackles a specific topic independent 
of the other minibooks. Any time you have questions, just flip to the mini­
book that covers that particular topic. 
Each minibook introduces a specific topic, and then gives you the basics 
to doing the focus of that particular minibook. Here’s a brief description of 
what you can find in each minibook:
Book I: Mac Basics
This minibook explains everything you need to know just to use your Mac, 
such as how to turn it on and off, how to use the mouse and keyboard, and 
how to interact with the Mac user interface. Even if you’re familiar with 
using a Mac, you might want to skim through this minibook to pick up tidbits 
of information you might not know.

How This Book Is Organized
Book II: Beyond the Basics
This minibook is the one to read if you want to go beyond the basics and do 
more with your Mac, such as run Dashboard widgets to keep up on the latest 
weather, news, or your horoscope with the touch of a button, or back up 
your Mac with Time Machine so you’re important information and programs 
are always safe and sound.
Book III: Your Mac as Your Entertainment Center
This minibook is all about using your Mac in the most entertaining non-business 
ways, such as organizing digital photographs, listening to audio files of your 
favorite songs, and watching movies and videos. In this minibook, you also get a 
tour of some exciting Mac games, as well as typing tutor programs that can help 
you increase your words-per-minute rate on your Mac’s keyboard.
Book IV: Online Endeavors and Safety
This minibook explains how to connect your Mac to the Internet and what 
you can do after you’re connected. This minibook gives you the basics of 
using the Safari Web browser, using e-mail with the Mail program, using 
iChat to conduct video conferences, and taking steps to protect your Mac 
from online security threats, such as junk e-mail and malicious software 
known as malware and viruses.
Book V: iLife
Computers are only as useful as the software they can run, so this minibook 
explains how to use the iLife suite to store and organize digital pictures and 
digital videos, edit movies and music you create, and output your creations 
to the Web or to a DVD you can share with family and friends. You also find 
out how to create your very own Web site!
Book VI: iWork
If you want to write reports, create presentations, or crunch numbers, this 
minibook has your name written all over it. From using Keynote to turn 
out crowd-pleasing presentations loaded with charts and videos to using 
Numbers to crunch numbers every which way to your heart’s delight (and 
your accountant’s) to writing the next Great American Dummies Book using 
Pages, this minibook is all about getting down to business — and having a 
little fun along the way.

Book VII: Address Book, iCal, and Running Windows
This minibook shows you how to store names and addresses with Address 
Book, track appointments with iCal, and run Windows programs on your Mac. 
Windows programs? Yes, you heard right — your Mac is an Equal Opportunity 
Operating System, and running Windows on your Mac is easy thanks to the 
Boot Camp program that turns your Mac into two computers in one.
Book VIII: Mac Networking
This minibook explains what you need to know to set up a network of Mac 
computers so you can share hard drives, folders, and printers with other 
Mac computers. In this minibook, you also discover how to use your Mac’s 
built-in Bluetooth feature to connect to wireless keyboards and mice, and 
even your smartphone and other Mac and Windows computers, so you can 
send information over the air between your Mac and other devices and com­
puters. Look, Ma, no wires!
The Appendix
You can modify existing images by taking pictures with a digital camera and 
then touching up those pictures in a graphics-editing program. You can also 
create images from scratch (a time-consuming although not terribly difficult 
task). The Appendix shows you — in a very quick-and-dirty manner — how 
to do each.
Icons Used in This Book
To help emphasize certain information, this book displays different icons in 
the page margins.
	
The Tip icon points out useful nuggets of information that can help you get 
things done more efficiently or direct you to something helpful that you 
might not know.
	
This icon highlights interesting information that isn’t necessary to know but 
can help explain why certain things work the way they do on a Mac. Feel free 
to skip this information if you’re in a hurry, but browse through this informa­
tion when you have time. You might find out something interesting that can 
help you use your Mac.

Where to Go from Here
	
Watch out! This icon highlights something that can go terribly wrong if 
you’re not careful, such as wiping out your important files or messing up 
your Mac. Make sure you read any Warning information before following any 
instructions.
	
This icon points out some useful information that isn’t quite as important as 
a Tip but not as threatening as a Warning. If you ignore this information, you 
can’t hurt your files or your Mac, but you might miss something useful.
Where to Go from Here
If you already know what type of help you need, jump right to that particular 
minibook and start reading. If you just want to know more about your Mac, feel 
free to skip around and browse through any minibook that catches your eye. 
For starters, you might want to begin with Book I and find out about the 
basics of using your Mac. This first minibook will likely show you new or dif­
ferent ways to do something and help you fully take control of your Mac.
No matter what your experience is with the Mac, don’t be afraid to explore 
and keep making new discoveries. While you expand your growing knowl­
edge, you’ll find the capabilities of your Mac expand right along with you. If 
you know what you want to do, your Mac can probably help you, and this 
book can show you how.

Chapter 1: Getting to Know 
Your Mac
In This Chapter
✓	Identifying your Mac model
✓	Understanding Mac processors
✓	Familiarizing yourself with the parts of your Mac
A
pple’s Macintosh computer — Mac for short — enjoys the envi­
able reputation of being the easiest computer to use in the world. 
Additionally, Macs are dependable, durable, and so beautifully designed, 
they incite techno-lust in gadget geeks like me, and ordinary “Joes” alike. 
For those doubly good reasons, you probably won’t buy a new Mac to 
replace your old one because you have to, but because you want to.
Despite the Mac’s legendary reputation for being easy to use, you might find 
the Mac slightly different from other computers you’ve used before. Taking 
a few moments to understand the different types of Macs available can help 
you understand how your Mac works.
Different Macintosh Models
The Macintosh has been around since 1984, and since that time, Apple has 
produced a wide variety of Mac models. Although you can still find and use 
older Macs, chances are good that if you buy a newer Mac, it will fall into 
one of three categories:
	
✦	 Desktop: Mac mini or Mac Pro, which require a separate display.
	
✦	 All-in-one desktop: iMac, which sandwiches the display and computer 
into one.
	
✦	 Notebook: MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro, which have built-in 
keyboards, trackpads that work like a mouse at the touch of your finger­
tip, and bright displays; a “clamshell” design lets you close and tote them 
in your backpack or messenger bag.

10
	
Like today’s iMac, the original Mac came with a built-in display, a keyboard, 
and a mouse. The desktop Mac models also come with a keyboard and 
mouse, but no display. When you buy a Mac desktop, you can plug in a 
display you already own, or you can buy a new one, such as Apple’s LED 
Cinema Display. This LED display consumes 30 percent less power than 
conventional LCD displays, and it lights to full brightness when powered on 
(without needing time to warm up). What’s more, the same LED-type dis­
play is standard equipment on every MacBook model.
By understanding the particular type of Mac that you have and its capabili­
ties, you’ll have a better idea of what your Mac can do. No matter what the 
capabilities of your Mac are, chances are good that it will work reliably for 
as long as you own it.
The Mac mini and Mac Pro
The biggest advantage of both the Mac mini and the Mac Pro are that you 
can choose the type of display to use and place it anywhere you want on 
your desk as long as you have a cable that can reach. The Mac mini, how­
ever, is small enough to hide under your desk, or situate in a corner of your 
desktop.
The Mac mini is a lower-priced, consumer version designed for people who 
want an inexpensive Mac for ordinary uses, such as word processing and 
writing, sending e-mail, browsing the Web, and playing video games. The 
Mac Pro is a much higher-priced, professional version with multiple drive 
bays and lots of expandability, as well as greater graphics and processing 
capabilities because of its advanced graphics processor and use of multiple 
processors.
The iMac
The all-in-one design of the iMac is an evolutionary extension of the original — 
1984-era — Mac design. The iMac combines the computer with a built-in display 
and speakers. On new and recent iMac models, it’s possible to connect external 
speakers and a second external display if you want.
The advantage of the all-in-one design of the iMac is that you have every­
thing you need in a single unit. The disadvantage is that if one part of your 
iMac fails (such as the display, or the internal DVD drive), you can’t easily 
replace the failed part.
The MacBook family
The three portable Mac notebook computers, MacBook, MacBook Air, and 
MacBook Pro, are the most popular Macintosh models. The MacBook and 
MacBook Air’s 13-inch screens are one-size-fits-all, and the MacBook Pro 
Different Macintosh Models

Book I
Chapter 1
Getting to Know 
Your Mac
11
models come in three screen sizes: 13-inch, 15-inch, and 17-inch. All of the 
MacBook models run on replaceable rechargeable battery packs or external 
power.
To make the MacBook Air as thin as a magazine, Apple did not include a 
built-in DVD drive. An optional external DVD drive, or connecting to another 
computer to use its DVD drive, are how the MacBook Air can access CDs, 
DVDs, and software programs on discs. The other MacBook models come 
with built-in DVD drives. If you need to take your Mac everywhere you go, 
you can choose from the ultralight MacBook Air, or the company’s best-
selling MacBook, or one of the higher performance MacBook Pro models.
	
Previous versions of the MacBook were the iBook, and previous versions of 
the MacBook Pro were the PowerBook.
The main differences in the three Mac notebooks are price and perfor­
mance. For the lower price of the MacBook, which weighs 4.5 pounds, you 
get a notebook designed for typical uses, such as word processing, brows­
ing the Internet, and playing 3D video games, albeit on a smaller-screen 
scale. Weighing in at a scant 3 pounds, the MacBook Air isn’t as fast as the 
MacBook, yet it carries a higher price — being thin and beautiful ain’t cheap. 
For the highest priced MacBook Pro models, you get faster — and at 5.5 and 
6.6 pounds, heavier — notebooks, a choice of 13-inch or larger displays, 
bigger hard drives, and higher performance graphics capabilities designed 
for professional uses, such as video, audio, and photo-editing.
Although the MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro models all have 
full-size keyboards, none includes the extra numeric keypad found on most 
external keyboards or on larger Windows notebooks. Instead of the mouse 
that comes in the box with every desktop Mac (or Windows computer, for 
that matter), the MacBooks use a built-in trackpad, which responds to your 
fingertip when you slide it to move the cursor on the screen.
	
If you find the keyboard or trackpad of your notebook Mac too clumsy 
to use, you can always plug an external keyboard and mouse into your 
notebook.
Understanding Mac Processors
If you’re going to write the history of the Mac, you’ll probably divide it into 
three eras. The first Macs used processors from the 68000 series, which 
served Macs well from 1984 to about 1994. Then came the PowerPC era, 
which lasted from about 1994 to 2005. Now, fast-forward to the present, 
where Macs use processors made by Intel. If you have an older Mac, it might 
use a PowerPC or Intel processor. If you just bought a new Mac, it has an 
Intel processor. 
Understanding Mac Processors

12
	
If you’re still using a Mac that uses the 68000 processor, you’re using an 
antique 1980s era computer that might be valuable for historical purposes, 
but it won’t be capable of running any of today’s software, including the Mac 
OS X operating system. 
The processor acts as the brain of your Mac. A computer is only as powerful 
as the processor inside. Generally, the newer your computer, the newer its 
processor and the faster it will run. 
Apple stopped using PowerPC processors in 2005 and started using Intel 
processors, which are the same type of processors used in many Windows 
PCs. Not only were Intel processors less expensive than PowerPC proces­
sors, but they were more powerful. As a bonus, using Intel processors also 
gave the Mac the ability to run the Microsoft Windows operating system 
(although dyed-in-the-wool Mac loyalists would wryly consider that a draw­
back — if not outright blasphemy!).
The type of processor in your Mac can determine the application programs 
(also known as software) your Mac can run. The three types of programs 
available are
	
✦	 PowerPC programs
	
✦	 Universal binaries
	
✦	 Intel programs
Older Mac programs were designed to run only on Mac computers using the 
PowerPC processor. However, all newer Mac computers that use Intel proces­
sors can also run PowerPC programs by using a built-in feature called Rosetta. 
When you run a PowerPC program on an Intel Mac, Rosetta tricks the program 
into thinking it’s actually running on a PowerPC processor. As a result, all Intel 
Macs can run nearly all software originally designed for PowerPC Macs.
Most programs now advertise themselves as universal binaries, which means 
they’re designed to run on both PowerPC and Intel processors. Before you 
buy any software, make sure it can run on your computer. If it’s a universal 
binary, it can run equally well on both PowerPC and Intel Macs.
Because Macs are no longer using the PowerPC processor, it’s only a matter 
of time before almost every Mac will be using an Intel processor. That’s why 
some companies are starting to write programs that run only on Intel Macs. 
If you have a Mac that uses a PowerPC processor, eventually you won’t be 
able to use the latest software, so you’ll be forced to switch to an Intel Mac if 
you want or need that new software.

To identify the type of processor used in your Mac, click the Apple menu in 
the upper-left corner of the screen and choose About This Mac. An About 
This Mac window appears, listing your processor as either PowerPC or Intel, 
as shown in Figure 1-1.
	
Figure 1-1:

PowerPC and Intel processors represent a family of related processors. 
Some of the PowerPC family of processors include the G3, G4, and G5 
PowerPC processors where the G3 is the slowest and the G5 the fastest. The 
Intel family of processors includes the Core Solo, Core Duo, Core 2 Duo, and 
Xeon, where the Core Solo is the slowest and the Xeon is the fastest. Every 
processor runs at a specific speed, so a 2.0 gigahertz (GHz) Core 2 Duo pro­
cessor will be slower than a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo processor (refer to Figure 
1-1). If understanding processor types and gigahertz confuses you, just 
remember that the most expensive computer is usually the fastest — except 
in the case of the MacBook Air, which costs more and runs slower than the 
lowest price MacBook.
Identifying the Parts of Your Mac
By looking at your Mac, you can tell whether it’s an all-in-one design (iMac), 
a notebook (MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro), or a desktop unit that 
lacks a built-in screen (Mac mini or Mac Pro). However, looking at the out­
side of your Mac can’t tell you the parts used on the inside. To identify the 
parts and capabilities of your Mac, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of the screen and 
choose About This Mac.
	
	 An About This Mac window appears (refer to Figure 1-1).

2.	 Click More Info.
	
	 A System Profiler window appears.
	
3.	 Click the Hardware option in the Contents category pane on the left to 
view a list of hardware items.
	
	 If the list of hardware items (such as Bluetooth, Memory, and USB) 
already appears under the Hardware category, skip this step.
	
4.	 Click a hardware item, such as Memory or Disc Burning.
	
	 The right pane of the System Profiler window displays the capabilities of 
your chosen hardware, as shown in Figure 1-2.
	
	 Don’t worry if the information displayed in the System Profiler window 
doesn’t make much sense to you right now. The main idea here is to 
figure out a quick way to find out about the capabilities of your Mac. 
Pick through the technical details to find the parts that you understand 
and search the Internet to look up the details you don’t understand.

choose System Profiler➪Quit System Profiler from the menu bar to 
close the window.
	
If you’re going to look at anything in the System Profiler window, check out 
Disc Burning and Graphics/Displays under the Hardware option:
	
✦	 Disc Burning tells you all about your DVD/CD–burning hardware, includ­
ing general info about all the different types of CDs and DVDs your Mac 
can read and write to, so you’ll know exactly which type to buy.
	
✦	 Graphics/Displays tells you whether your Mac has a separate graphics 
card. If you see shared in the VRAM category (Video RAM), your Mac 
doesn’t have a separate graphics card and shares the main memory, 
which means its graphics capabilities will (usually) be slower than a Mac 
that has a separate graphics card. If you do not see shared, the VRAM 
category simply lists the amount of memory used by the separate graph­
ics card. The more memory, the better your graphics capabilities.
	
If you have a Mac Pro, you have the option of replacing your graphics 
card with a better one. If you have any other type of Mac (iMac, MacBook, 
MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, or Mac mini), your Mac’s built-in graphics capa­
bilities cannot be upgraded with a more powerful graphics card.

efore you can use your Mac, you have to start it up — which makes 
perfect sense. Now, get ready for the counterintuitive part. After you 
have your Mac up and running, you can just leave it on. Don’t worry about 
wasting electricity; when not in use, the Mac is smart enough to put itself 
into a low-energy mode — Sleep mode, to be precise — to burn a minimum 
of energy.
	
To adjust the amount of time your Mac sits idle before it goes to sleep, click 
the Apple menu, choose System Preferences, and then click the Energy 
Saver icon. To learn more about adjusting your Mac’s Energy Saver prefer­
ences, check out Book I, Chapter 6.
	
Now to (kind of) contradict myself. There are times when leaving your Mac 
on in the wee hours of the morning can actually benefit your Mac’s overall 
performance and usability — sort of the way flossing every night can make 
for healthier, longer lasting pearly whites. To learn more about exactly 
what your Mac is up to while you’re presumably sleeping, point your Web 
browser to http://www.osxfaq.com/DailyTips/10-2004/10-04.ws. 
If, after reading about your Mac’s nocturnal habits, you want to make sure 
yours is awake at the times described in the posting, go to Energy Saver 
preferences and click the Schedule button to set your Mac to wake at the 
prescribed hour, as described in the “Adjusting your Mac’s Sleep mode and 
Energy Saver settings” section, later in this chapter. Of course, you’ll want 
to make sure you set your Mac’s Energy Saver Schedule setting to put your 
Mac back to sleep when your Mac is done performing its own version of 
flossing to minimize unnecessary power consumption and maximize savings 
on your energy bill. 
	
Turning off your Mac completely when you won’t be using it for an extended 
length of time can extend its useful life, waste less energy, and save you a 
few bucks on your yearly energy expense to boot — or not to boot, when 
you think about it.

18
	
Shutting down and restarting your Mac can resolve weird situations, such as 
unresponsive or slow-running programs, because your Mac runs a number of 
behind-the-scenes file system housekeeping chores every time you start it.
Starting Your Mac
Here’s the simple way to start your Mac — the way you’ll probably use 99 
percent of the time: Press the Power button.
Depending on the type of Mac you have, the power button might be in back 
(Mac mini and some iMacs), front (Mac Pro and some iMacs), or above 
the keyboard (on notebook models like the MacBook, MacBook Air, and 
MacBook Pro).
A few seconds after you press the power button, your Mac chimes to let you 
know that it’s starting. (Techie types say booting up, a term derived from the 
phrase “to lift yourself up by the bootstraps.”)
The moment electricity courses through, your Mac’s electronic brain imme­
diately looks for instructions embedded inside a special Read-Only Memory 
(or ROM) chip. While your computer is reading these instructions (also 
known as firmware), it displays a big gray Apple logo on the screen to let you 
know that the computer is working and hasn’t forgotten about you.
The firmware instructions tell the computer to make sure all of its compo­
nents are working. If some part of your computer (say a memory chip) is 
defective, your computer will stop. Unless you know something about repair­
ing the physical parts of a Macintosh, this is the time to haul your Mac to 
the nearest Apple Store or authorized repair shop, or to call Apple Support 
to arrange shipping your bummed-out Mac directly to Apple for repair (800-
275-2273 in the United States).
	
Sometimes a Mac might refuse to start correctly because of software prob­
lems. To fix software problems, check out Book II, Chapter 5, which explains 
how to perform basic troubleshooting on a Mac.
After your computer determines that all components are working, the last 
set of instructions on the chip tells the computer, “Now that you know all 
your parts are working, load an operating system.”
	
When you unpack your Mac and turn it on for the very first time, it asks you 
to type your name and make up a password to create an account for using 
your Mac. To guide you through the process of setting up a Mac for the first 
time, a special program called the Setup Assistant runs, which asks for your 
time zone, the date, and whether you want to transfer files and programs 
Starting Your Mac

from another Mac to your newer one. Normally, you need to run through 
this initial procedure only once, but you also have to perform this procedure 
if you reinstall your operating system. The most important part of this initial 
procedure is remembering the password you choose because you’ll need it 
to log in to your account or install new software.
An operating system is the program that controls your computer and is 
almost always stored on your computer’s built-in hard drive (rather than 
on an external drive). On the Mac, the operating system is named Mac OS X 
(for Macintosh Operating System number ten) and is followed by a version 
number, such as 10.6.
	
Apple code-names each version of OS X. The current version is OS X 10.6 
Snow Leopard, which succeeds 10.5 Leopard, which in turn succeeded 10.4 
Tiger, which was preceded by 10.3 Panther, and so on.
After the operating system loads and you log in, you can start using your 
computer to run other programs so you can write a letter or send an e-mail, 
browse the Web, calculate your taxes, or play a game. (You know, all the 
things you bought your Mac for in the first place.)
Putting a Mac in Sleep Mode
After you finish using your Mac, you don’t have to turn it off and then turn it 
on when you want to use it again. To save time (and do the “green” thing by 
conserving energy!), put your Mac into Sleep mode instead. When you put 
your Mac to sleep, it shuts down almost every power-draining component 
of your Mac, and draws only a teensy trickle of power so you can instantly 
wake it up with a touch of the keyboard or click of the mouse. Presto 
change-o: Your Mac immediately returns to the same state you left it in, 
without making you wait the minute or more it takes to power on when it’s 
completely shut down.
To put your Mac to sleep, you have a choice of doing it manually or auto­
matically. When you need to be away from your Mac for a short period (such 
as pouring a second cup of joe), you might want to put your Mac to sleep 
manually. If you suddenly bolt to the kitchen to tend to a smoking stovetop 
emergency without putting your Mac to sleep, your Mac can thoughtfully put 
itself to sleep for you, automatically.
Putting a Mac in Sleep mode manually
To put your Mac to sleep manually, choose one of the following three 
actions:
Putting a Mac in Sleep Mode

✦	 Choose Ú➪Sleep.
	
✦	 Press the power button (or press Control+Eject) and, when a dialog 
appears, as shown in Figure 2-1, click the Sleep button (or press the S 
key on your Mac’s keyboard).
	
✦	 Press Command+Option+Eject.
	
Figure 2-1: 
If you press 
the power 
button, you 
see a dialog 
you can use 
to put your 
computer in 
Sleep mode.
	
	
The Apple menu is located in the upper-left corner of the screen.
To wake a sleeping Mac, click the mouse button or tap any key. To keep from 
accidentally typing any characters into a currently running program, press a 
noncharacter key, such as Shift, or one of the arrow keys.
	
If you have a MacBook, a faster way to put it to sleep is to close its lid. When 
a MacBook is sleeping, you can safely move it without worrying about jarring 
the built-in hard disk that spins most of the time your MacBook is “awake” 
and in use. Open the lid on your sleeping MacBook to wake it up.
	
Depending on which Mac model you own, you may notice a built-in combi­
nation power/sleep indicator light that softly pulses like a firefly when your 
Mac is in Sleep mode. On my MacBook Air, the power/sleep indicator light 
is on the front edge below the right wrist rest. On my Mac mini, the indica­
tor light is in the lower-right corner. No such light is anywhere on my iMac, 
which appears to be totally in the dark when it’s asleep.
Adjusting your Mac’s Sleep mode 
and Energy Saver settings
To change your Mac’s energy-saving options — such as whether it powers 
off the hard disk when possible, or how long it waits before entering Sleep 
mode — you use the Energy Saver Preferences pane.

Chapter 2

Sleeping, and

Because you can’t always plan how long you might be away from your Mac, 
you can make it put itself in Sleep mode after a fixed period — say, ten min­
utes or so. That way, if your Mac doesn’t detect any keyboard or mouse 
activity within that fixed period, your computer will put itself into Sleep 
mode automatically.
To make your computer go to sleep automatically, you need to set the inac­
tivity time (also known as idle time), which defines how long your computer 
waits before putting itself into Sleep mode. This time can be as short as 
one minute or as long as three hours. The shorter you define the inactivity 
period, the sooner your Mac might suddenly go to sleep while you’re just 
staring at the screen. 
Optionally, you can specify whether your Mac’s display or hard drive (or 
both) can go to sleep rather than (or before) putting your Mac completely 
to sleep in Sleep mode. Because the hard drive and the display consume 
the most power, letting your Mac put at least one or both to sleep can dra­
matically reduce the amount of power your Mac consumes when it’s on and 
awake.
You can also activate the Energy Saver Schedule option to tell your Mac 
when to turn itself on or off or enter Sleep mode, based on day and time 
choices that you set to suit your individual workday, nighttime, and week­
end routine. 
To adjust your Mac’s automatic Sleep mode, whether the display and hard 
disk can be put to sleep when your Mac is on and still awake, and set a 
schedule your Mac can follow to automatically wake up and go to sleep, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences.
	
2.	 Click the Energy Saver icon.
	
	 The Energy Saver Preferences pane opens.
If you use a MacBook, you see two clickable tabs at the top of the Energy 
Saver preferences pane: Battery and Power Adapter (see Figure 2-2). Desktop 
Mac users see two options: Sleep and Options.
	
If you can’t move the sliders or select and deselect the check boxes, the 
likely reason is that the settings are locked. To unlock the settings so that 
you can change them, do what it says alongside the tiny lock icon in the 
lower-left corner: Click the lock to make changes.

Depending on which Mac model you use, you might see some but not all of 
the options in the following list. Don’t worry, there’s nothing wrong with 
your Mac if you don’t see an option or two — it’s not there because your 
Mac has no use for it.
Here’s a description of the Energy Saver options:
	
✦	 Graphics: Select this option to adjust the tradeoff between battery life 
and graphics performance. You need to log out and log in again for the 
change to take effect.
	
✦	 Battery, Power Adapter, and UPS: Clicking one of these tabs chooses 
which group of options to change. Your computer will use that group of 
options when it’s getting power from that source.
	
✦	 Computer Sleep: Moving this slider to the left is the more energy-efficient 
way to go. Moving to the right is less efficient because it allows a smart 
device to do nothing other than burn energy for no good reason.
	
✦	 Display Sleep: Maybe you take a break and then return to your com­
puter at regular intervals and you don’t want to wake your Mac from 
lots of catnaps several times a day. Fair enough. Set the Computer Sleep 
slider (see the preceding bullet) a little farther to the right and then drag 
the Display Sleep slider to the left to snap your Mac to attention in a 
flash, with only the slightest pause before the screen comes back to life.
	
✦	 Put the Hard Disks(s) to Sleep When Possible: Select this option to 
“snooze” the hard disk whenever it determines that the programs you’re 
running don’t need to keep the drive (or drives) spinning. If you regularly 
perform hard disk intensive tasks, such as editing or watching videos, 
listening to music using iTunes, or playing 3D games, deselect this option.
	
✦	 Wake for Ethernet Network Administration Access: Choose this option 
if you want other users in your house or workplace to access your Mac’s 
shared resources, such as shared printers or iTunes playlists, even 
when your computer is in Sleep mode.

✦	 Automatically Reduce the Brightness of the Display Before Display 
Sleep: When you select this option, the brightness level on the display 
drops a few notches before blanking out the screen after the length of 
time you select in the Display Sleep setting (see previous bullet).
	
✦	 Start Up Automatically After a Power Failure: Whether brownouts, 
blackouts, or black cats knocking out power cords, power failures 
happen. Use this option to specify how your Mac should react when the 
lights come on after a power failure. Select the check box if you want 
your Mac to restart, and deselect it if you prefer to turn it back on your­
self after the power is running again.
	
	 For the environmentally friendliest choice, deselect this option unless 
your Mac is pulling duty as a file server or performing some other ser­
vice that absolutely requires it to be on 24/7.
	
✦	 Show Battery Status in the Menu Bar: Selecting this option on your 
MacBook notebook lets you keep visual tabs on how much battery juice 
remains when your machine is unplugged from the wall outlet — and 
how long you need to wait until its battery is fully charged after you 
plug into a power outlet. To change the information you see, click the 
Battery Status icon, choose Show, and then choose Icon Only, Time, or 
Percentage to see your battery’s status the way you like it.
	
✦	 Schedule: Click the Schedule button to open these scheduling options:
 
• Start Up or Wake: Choose when you want your Mac to greet you on 
weekdays or weekends, every day, or one day in particular. (The 
scheduler has no option for folks whose “Friday night” begins on a 
weekday.) Click the up and down arrows to adjust the time, as shown 
in Figure 2-3 — or click the time slots and enter your preference 
directly.
 
• Sleep/Restart/Shutdown: Choose one of these pop-up options if you 
want your Mac to do as instructed and adjust the time, as described 
in the preceding bullet, to suit your schedule.

Shutting Down Your Mac
Shutting Down Your Mac
If you won’t use your Mac for an extended period, you can shut it down to 
save energy and extend the life of your beloved computer. You have three 
ways to shut down your Mac:
	
✦	 Choose Ú➪Shut Down as shown in Figure 2-4. A dialog appears, asking 
if you’re sure that you want to shut down. (Refer to Figure 2-1.) Click 
Cancel or Shut Down. (If you don’t click either option, your Mac will shut 
down automatically after one minute.)
	
Figure 2-4: 
Use this 
menu to 
turn off your 
computer.
	
	
	 Holding the Option key and then choosing Ú➪Shut Down bypasses the 
prompt asking if you’re sure that you want to shut down. Yes, Mr. Mac, 
I’m sure I’m sure, but thank you for your concern.
	
✦	 Press Control+Eject (or press the power button) and when a dialog 
appears (refer to Figure 2-1), click the Shut Down button, or press the 
Return key.
	
✦	 Press and hold the power button to force your Mac to shut down after 
a few seconds wait (or press and hold Ô+Control and then press the 
power button to force your Mac to shut down at once).
	
	 This option, a force shutdown, forces all running programs to shut down 
right away. Generally, a force shutdown is your last resort if your Mac 
appears to have frozen, making it unresponsive. If only a single program 
is freezing or acting flaky, it’s usually better to force quit that single 
program instead of shutting down your entire computer. (See Book I, 
Chapter 4 for information about how to force quit a single program.) 
Performing a force shutdown can cause you to lose any changes you’ve 
made to a letter or other file you’re working on since the last time you 
saved it before the lockup. That’s why you should use force shutdown 
only as a last resort.

Restarting a Mac
	
You can also force shutdown your Mac by pressing the 
Control+Option+Ô+Eject keystroke combination.
Restarting a Mac
Sometimes the Mac can start acting sluggish, or programs might fail to run. 
When that happens, you can choose Ú➪Shut Down or Restart to properly 
shut down or restart your Mac then start it again, which essentially clears 
your computer’s memory and starts it fresh.
To restart your computer, you have three choices:
	
✦	 Press the power button (or press Control+Eject) and, when a dialog 
appears, click the Restart button (refer to Figure 2-1) or press the R key.
	
✦	 Choose Ú➪Restart.
	
✦	 Press Control+Ô+Eject.
When you restart your computer, your Mac closes all running programs; you 
will have the chance to save any files you’re working on. After you choose to 
save any files, those programs are closed and then your Mac will shut down 
and boot up again.

T
heoretically, using a computer is simple. In practice, using a computer 
can cause people to suffer a wide range of emotions from elation to 
sheer frustration and despair.
The problem with using a computer stems mostly from two causes:
	
✦	 Not knowing what the computer can do
	
✦	 Not knowing how to tell the computer what you want it to do
In the early days of personal computers, this communication gap between 
users and computers arose mostly from ordinary people trying to use 
machines designed by engineers for other engineers. If you didn’t under­
stand how a computer engineer thinks (or doesn’t think), computers 
seemed nearly impossible to understand.
Fortunately, Apple has solved this problem with the Mac. Instead of design­
ing a computer for other computer engineers, Apple designed a computer 
for ordinary people. And what do ordinary people want? Here’s the short 
(but definitely important) list:
	
✦	 Reliability
	
✦	 Ease of use
From a technical point of view, what makes the Mac reliable is its operating 
system, Mac OS X. An operating system is nothing more than a program that 
makes your computer actually work.

28
Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
An operating system works in the background. When you use a computer, 
you don’t really notice the operating system, but you do see its user inter­
face. The user interface is like a clerk at the front desk of a hotel. Instead of 
talking directly to the housekeeper or the plumber (the operating system), 
you always talk to the front desk clerk, and the clerk talks to the house­
keeper or plumber. 
Apple designed a user interface that everyone can understand. Dubbed 
Aqua, Apple’s user interface puts the friendly face on the Mac.
Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
To control your Mac, you use the mouse (or trackpad on notebook Macs) 
and the keyboard. Both the mouse (or trackpad) and the keyboard can 
choose commands, manipulate items on the screen, or create such data as 
text or pictures.
	
To modify how your Mac’s mouse (or trackpad) and keyboard operate, 
click the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of the screen and choose 
System Preferences. Then click the Keyboard icon, or the Mouse icon, or the 
Trackpad icon, to adjust each accordingly.
	
To learn how you can make the trackpad built into the latest MacBook 
notebook models work like a very advanced mouse, check out the nearby 
sidebar, “Look Ma, no mouse!”
The parts of the mouse
A typical mouse looks like a bar of soap with one or more buttons and a 
rubber wheel or ball in the middle. The main purpose of the mouse is to 
move a pointer on the screen, which tells the computer, “See what I’m point­
ing at right now? That’s what I want to select.”
Clicking, double-clicking, and dragging with the left mouse button
A mouse typically has one button on the left and one on the right. To select 
an item on the screen, you move the mouse to point at that item and then 
press and release (click) the left mouse button.
	
The Apple Mighty Mouse features right and left mouse buttons, but try as 
you might, you won’t be able to spot them with the naked eye. Mighty Mouse 
can sense when you press either the left or right side of its smooth surface, 
thanks to touch-sensitive technology that detects your fingertip gestures 
just like the MacBook touchpads.

Book I
Chapter 3
Getting Acquainted

Interface
29
Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
	
✦	 Clicking (also called single-clicking): Moving the mouse and pressing 
the left mouse button or the mouse’s single button is the most common 
activity with a mouse. 
	
✦	 Double-clicking: If you point at something and click the left mouse button 
or the mouse’s single button twice in rapid succession (that is, you double-
click it), you can often select an item and open it at the same time. 
	
✦	 Dragging: Another common activity with the mouse is dragging. Dragging 
means pointing at an item on the screen, holding down the left mouse 
button or the mouse’s single button, moving the mouse, and then releas­
ing the button. Dragging is often used to move items on the screen.
All of Apple’s current MacBook models sport 
cool new trackpads that can do more than 
most advanced multi-button mice — some of 
the trackpads even do away with the single 
button found on earlier MacBook, iBook, and 
PowerBook notebooks. Thanks to the track­
pads’ smart sensing abilities, you can pull off 
a number of mouse-like actions with a single, 
two, three, or four touch, tap, or gesture of 
your fingertips (or a combination of both). As 
the figure illustrates, turning on the MacBook 
trackpad’s fancy footfinger-work options gives 
you the ability to perform a single click by tap­
ping the touchpad surface, scroll Web pages by 
sliding two fingertips up and down, perform a 
Control-click by tapping the trackpad with two 
fingertips at the same time, or switch between 
programs you’re running by swiping four finger­
prints left or right across the trackpad. Thanks 
to super-handy features like these, it’s safe to 
bet that the extinction rate of mice will certainly 
climb as more people buy new MacBooks.
Look Ma, no mouse!

30
Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
	
If you know how to point and click, double-click, and point and drag the 
mouse, you’ve mastered the basics of controlling your Mac with a mouse.
Scrolling with the scroll wheel or ball
Many mice have a rubber wheel or ball embedded in the middle. By roll­
ing this wheel or ball, you can make items (such as text or a picture) scroll 
up/down or right/left on the screen. Using the scroll wheel or ball can 
make your Mac a lot easier to use. Clicking with the right mouse button (or 
Control-clicking) opens a shortcut menu of commands that can be faster to 
choose than clicking the menu bar menus at the top of the screen.
Like the scroll wheel or ball, the right mouse button is optional but 
convenient. Pointing the mouse and pressing the right mouse button 
is right-clicking.
Right-clicking commonly displays a menu of commands (called a contextual 
or shortcut menu) at the point you clicked to do something with the item 
that the mouse is currently pointing at. For example, if you point at a mis­
spelled word, right-clicking that misspelled word can display a list of prop­
erly spelled words to choose from, as shown in Figure 3-1.

Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
	
Some older mice (as well as MacBook notebook models) do not have a right 
mouse button. To simulate a right-click with a single-button mouse, hold 
down the Control key and click the mouse button. On MacBooks, hold down 
the Control key and click the trackpad button, or hold two fingers down on 
the trackpad and then click the trackpad button.
	
If you don’t like the mouse that came with your Mac, you can always buy 
a replacement mouse or trackball. Some mice are molded to better fit the 
shape of your hand, so find a mouse that you like and plug it into the USB 
port of your Mac, or get a wireless mouse that connects to your Mac using 
your Mac’s Bluetooth wireless connection feature if it has one.
The parts of the keyboard
The primary use of the keyboard is to type information. However, the 
keyboard can also select items and menu commands — sometimes more 
quickly than using the mouse. Figure 3-2 shows that the keyboard groups 
related keys together. The next few sections cover each group of keys in 
detail.

Special feature and function keys
Depending on your particular keyboard, you might see 12 to 20 function keys 
running along the top of the keyboard. These function keys are labeled F1 
through F12/F19, along with an Escape key — brilliantly abbreviated “Esc” — 
and an Eject key that looks like a triangle on top of a horizontal line. 
By default, every new and recent Mac’s function key labels are tiny and 
shared by larger icons that represent special feature keys that you press 
to do things like turn down the screen brightness (F1), play or pause music 
you’re listening to in iTunes(F8), or open your Mac’s Dashboard Widgets 
program to check the weather forecast (F4). Although the icons on each of 
these special feature keys are self-evident, check out Table 3-1 to find out 
what all of your Mac’s special features keys do when you press them.

In actuality, the Mac’s program-specific function keys are selected by press­
ing and holding the Fn key, and then pressing one of the function keys on the 
upper row of the keyboard. In Microsoft Word, for instance, pressing Fn+F7 
tells Word to run the spell checker feature, while pressing Fn+F5 opens the 
Find and Replace dialog.
In other words, holding down the Fn key tells your Mac, “Ignore the special 
feature controls assigned to that function key listed in Table 3-1 and just 
behave like an old-fashioned function key.”
	
To reverse the way the Mac’s function keys work when you press them, click Ú➪
System Preferences➪Keyboard icon. Click the Keyboard tab at the top of 
the window, then check the box next to Use all F1, F2, etc. Keys as Standard 
Function Keys. When you activate this option, you must hold down the Fn 
key to perform the commands shown in Table 3-1, but you do not need to 
hold down the Fn key to use program-specific function keys as described 
above.
Holding the Fn key and pressing the F8 function key (Fn+F8) displays mul­
tiple workspaces defined by the Spaces feature (which you find out more 
about in Book I, Chapter 4).

Book I 
Chapter 3
Getting Acquainted

Interface
33
Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
Holding the Fn key and pressing the F9 through F11 function keys activates 
a feature on your Mac called Exposé. Pressing Fn+F9 lets you see all the 
open windows so you can pick the one you want to use. Pressing Fn+F10 
shows you all windows that belong to the active program. (You can iden­
tify the active program by looking for its name on the left side of the menu 
bar.) Pressing Fn+F11 shoves all windows out of the way so you can see the 
Desktop. 
Pressing Fn+F12 displays the Dashboard program and its widgets, which 
are simple miniprograms, such as a calculator, calendar, or a display of 
your local weather forecast. (You find out more about Dashboard in Book II, 
Chapter 4.)
Although Fn+F9 and Fn+F12 keys work as I say, you can skip all this hold-
down-the-Fn-key business and just press the buttons dedicated to those 
features and others as listed in Table 3-1.
As for the other keys — F1 through F7 and (possibly) F13 through F19 — 
holding the Fn key and pressing these fellows can carry out shortcut com­
mands on a program by program basis. For instance, pressing Fn+F7 in 
Microsoft Word for the Macintosh opens the program’s spelling and gram­
mar checker utility.
	
Originally, function keys existed because some programs assigned commands 
to different function keys. Unfortunately, every program assigned different 
commands to identical function keys, which sometimes made function keys 
more confusing than helpful. You can assign your own commands to differ­
ent function keys, but just remember that not every Mac will have the same 
commands assigned to the same function keys. (Not everyone thinks exactly 
like you, as amazing as that might seem.) To customize which function keys 
perform which commands, choose Ú➪System Preferences➪Keyboard; then 
click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab at the top of the window and adjust your 
Mac’s keyboard shortcuts to your heart’s content.
Turning to the two other keys grouped with the function keys, here’s what you 
need to know. The Esc key often works as a “You may be excused” command. 
For example, if a pull-down menu appears on the screen and you want it to go 
away, press the Esc key. The Eject key ejects a CD or DVD from your Mac.
Typewriter keys
You use the typewriter (also known as the alphanumeric) keys to create 
data — the typing-a-letter-in-a-word-processor stuff or the entering-of-names-
and-addresses-into-the-Address-Book-program stuff. When you press a 
typewriter key, you’re telling the Mac what character to type at the cursor 
position, which often appears as a blinking vertical line on the screen.

34
Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
	
You can move the cursor by pointing to and clicking a new location with the 
mouse or by pressing the arrow keys as explained in the upcoming “Arrow 
keys” section.
One typewriter key that doesn’t type anything is the big Delete key that 
appears to the right of the +/= key. The Delete key deletes any characters 
that appear to the left of the cursor. If you hold down the Delete key, your 
Mac deletes any characters to the left of the cursor until you lift your finger.
Two other typewriter keys that don’t type anything are the Tab key and 
the Return key, which is sometimes labeled Enter on older Mac keyboards 
or certain external keyboards you can buy to use with your Mac. The Tab 
key indents text in a word processor, but it can also highlight different text 
boxes, such as ones in which you type your shipping address on the Web 
page form of an online bookstore or another merchant.
The Return key moves the cursor to the next line in a word processor, but 
can also choose a default button (which appears in blue) on the screen. The 
default button in the Print dialog is labeled Print, and the default button in 
the Save dialog is labeled Save. 
Numeric keys
The numeric keys appear on the right side of the keyboard (if yours has 
them!) and arrange the numbers 0 through 9 in rows and columns like a typi­
cal calculator keypad. The main use for the numeric keys is to make typing 
numbers faster and easier than using the numeric keys on the top row of the 
typewriter keys. 
On earlier MacBook keyboards, the numeric keys were assigned to a section 
of keys on the normal typewriter keys. To switch the numeric keys on, you 
had to press the Num Lock key. To switch the numeric keys off, you had to 
press the Num Lock key again. Recent and new MacBooks no longer sport 
these numeric keys.
Arrow keys
The cursor often appears as a vertical blinking line and acts like a place­
holder. Wherever the cursor appears, that’s where your next character will 
appear if you press a typewriter key. You can move the cursor with the 
mouse, or you can move it with the arrow keys. 
The up arrow moves the cursor up, the down arrow moves the cursor down, 
the right arrow moves the cursor right, and the left arrow moves the cursor 
left. (Could it be any more logical?) Depending on the program you’re using, 

Book I 
Chapter 3
Getting Acquainted 
with the Mac User 
Interface
35
Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
pressing an arrow key might move the cursor in different ways. For example, 
pressing the right arrow key in a word processor moves the cursor right one 
character, but pressing that same right arrow key in a spreadsheet might 
move the cursor to the adjacent cell on the right.
On some Mac keyboards, you might see four additional cursor control keys 
labeled Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down. Typically, the Page Up key 
scrolls up one screen, and the Page Down key scrolls down one screen. 
Many programs ignore the Home and End keys, but some programs let you 
move the cursor with them. For example, Microsoft Word uses the Home key 
to move the cursor to the beginning of a line or row and the End key to move 
the cursor to the end of a line or row.
	
Just because you might not see the Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down 
keys on your Mac or MacBook keyboard doesn’t mean those command keys 
aren’t there. On the MacBook that I’m using to write this, holding down the 
Fn key and then pressing the left arrow key acts as the Home key, which 
moves the cursor to the start of the line I’m on. Pressing Fn+→ jumps the 
cursor to the end of the current line, Fn+↑ scrolls the chapter up one page, 
and Fn+↓ scrolls the text down one page. Because seeing is believing, try it 
on your own Mac keyboard so you can see what I mean — even if you don’t 
see keys bearing those actual labels.
To the left of the End key, you might find a smaller Delete key. Like the bigger 
Delete key, this smaller Delete key also deletes characters one at a time.
	
The big Delete key erases characters to the left of the cursor. The small 
Delete key erases characters to the right of the cursor.
Modifier keys
Modifier keys are almost never used individually. Instead, modifier keys are 
usually held down while tapping another key. The four modifier keys are the 
Function (Fn) keys previously mentioned in a few of the previous sections: 
Shift, Control (Ctrl), Option, and Ô (Command).
If you press the S key in a word processing document, your Mac types the 
letter “s” on the screen, but if you hold down a modifier key, such as the 
Command key (Ô), and then press the S key, the S key is modified to behave 
differently. In this case, holding down the Ô key followed by the S key (Ô+S) 
tells your word processing program to issue the Save command and save 
whatever you typed or changed since the last time you saved the document.

36
Mastering the Mouse and Keyboard
Most modifier keystrokes involve pressing two keys, such as Ô+Q (the Quit 
command), but some modifier keystrokes can involve pressing three or four 
keys, such as Shift+Ô+3, which saves a snapshot of what you seen on your 
screen as an image file, which is commonly referred to as a screenshot.
The main use for modifier keys is to help you choose commands quickly 
without fumbling with the mouse. Every program includes dozens of such 
keystroke shortcuts, but Table 3-2 lists the common keystroke shortcuts 
that work in most programs.

that it’s too soft and squishy, like touching the belly of an animal. If you want 
a more solid-feeling keyboard that provides tactile feedback (and that good 
ol’ fashioned clickity-clackity sound), check out the Das Keyboard (www.
daskeyboard.com).
Getting to Know the Mac User Interface
The Mac user interface acts like a communication pathway between you and 
the operating system and serves three purposes:
	
✦	 To display all the options that you can choose
	
✦	 To display information
	
✦	 To accept commands
	
One of the most crucial parts of the Mac user interface is a program called 
the Finder, which displays files stored on your Mac. You find out more about 
the Finder later in this chapter.
The menu bar
The menu bar provides a single location where you can find nearly every 
possible command you might need. Think of the menu bar as a restaurant 
menu. Any time you want to order another dish, you can look at the menu to 
see what’s available. Likewise, when using a Mac, you always know the menu 
bar will appear at the top of the screen. The menu bar consists of three 
parts, as shown in Figure 3-5:

Figure 3-5: 
The three 
parts of the 
menu bar.

Application menu
Menulets
	
✦	 The Apple menu: This menu always appears on the menu bar and gives 
you one-click access to commands for controlling or modifying your Mac.
	
✦	 The Application menu: Here’s where you find the name of the active 
program along with several menus that contain commands for control­
ling that particular program and its data. (If you don’t run any additional 
programs, your Mac always runs the Finder program, which you find out 
more about in this chapter.)
	
✦	 Menulets (Icons): Menulets act like miniature menus that perform one or 
more functions for specific programs or system features, such as provid­
ing fast access to a troubleshooting utility, adjusting the volume, or dis­
playing the current time. Clicking a menulet displays a small pull-down 
menu or control, as shown in Figure 3-6.
	
Figure 3-6: 
Menulets let 
you control 
program 
or feature 
functions of 
your Mac.
	
	
If you don’t want a menulet cluttering up the menu bar, you can typically 
remove it by holding down the Ô key, moving the pointer over the menulet 
you want to remove, dragging (moving) the mouse off the menu bar, and 
then releasing the mouse button. 
Understanding menu commands
Each menu on the menu bar contains a group of related commands. The File 
menu contains commands for opening, saving, and printing files, and the 

Book I 
Chapter 3
Getting Acquainted 
with the Mac User 
Interface
39
Getting to Know the Mac User Interface
Edit menu contains commands for copying or deleting selected items. The 
number and names of different menus depend on the program.
To give a command to your Mac, click a menu title on the menu bar (such 
as File or Edit) to call up a pull-down menu listing all the commands you 
can choose. Then click the command you want the computer to follow 
(File➪Save, for example).
Working with dialogs
When your Mac needs information from you or wants to present a choice 
you can make, it typically displays a dialog — essentially a box that offers a 
variety of choices. Some common dialogs appear when you choose the Print, 
Save, and Open commands.
Dialogs often appear in a condensed version, but you can blow them up 
into an expanded version, as shown in Figure 3-7. To switch between the 
expanded and the condensed version of the Save dialog, click the Arrow 
button.
	
Figure 3-7: 
When 
expanded, 
the Print 
dialog 
offers more 
options.
	
Whether expanded or condensed, every dialog displays buttons that either 
let you cancel the command or complete it. To cancel a command, you have 
two choices:

40
Getting to Know the Mac User Interface
	
✦	 Click the Cancel button.
	
✦	 Press Esc.
To complete a command, you also have two choices:
	
✦	 Click the button that represents the command that you want to com­
plete, such as Save or Print.
	
✦	 Press Return to choose the default button, which appears in blue.
Viewing data in a window
Every program needs to accept, manipulate, and/or display data, also 
referred to as information. A word processor lets you type and edit text, an 
accounting program lets you type and calculate numbers, and a presentation 
program lets you display text and pictures. To help you work with different 
types of information (such as text, pictures, audio, and video files), every 
program displays information inside a rectangular area called a window, as 
shown in Figure 3-8.
	
In the early days of personal computers, a program treated the entire screen 
as a window for displaying information. This was fine when computers could 
run only one program at a time, but nowadays every computer lets you run 
several programs at the same time. To give each program a chance to dis­
play information on the screen, computers can present multiple windows for 
each program you’re running, allowing each window to act like a miniature 
screen that you can stack on top of other windows.
Dividing a screen into multiple windows offers several advantages:
	
✦	 Two or more programs can display information on the screen 
simultaneously.
	
✦	 A single program can open and display information stored in two or 
more files or display two or more views of the same file.
	
✦	 You can copy (or move) data from one window to another. If each 
window belongs to a different program, this action transfers data from 
one program to another.
Of course, windows aren’t perfect. When a window appears on the screen, 
it might be too big or too small, hard to find because it’s hidden behind 
another window, or displaying the beginning of a file when you want to see

the middle or the end. To control the appearance of a window, most 
windows provide the built-in controls shown in Figure 3-9. The following 
sections show you what you can do with these controls.
	
Figure 3-8: 
Windows

Moving a window with the title bar
The title bar of every window serves two purposes:
	
✦	 Identifies the filename that contains the information displayed in the 
window.
	
✦	 Provides a place to grab when you want to drag (move) the window to a 
new location on the screen.
If you want to move a window on the screen, you can typically do so by drag­
ging its title bar. Here’s how:
	
1.	 Move the pointer over the title bar of the window you want to move.
	
2.	 Hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse.
	
	 If you have a two-button mouse, hold down the left mouse button. 
	
	 The window moves wherever you drag the mouse.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new location of 
the window.

Resizing a window
Sometimes a window might be in the perfect location, but it’s too small or 
too large for what you want to do at that moment. To change the size of a 
window, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Move the pointer over the resize corner in the bottom-right corner of 
the window. 
	
2.	 Hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse.
	
	 If you have a two-button mouse, hold down the left mouse button. 
	
	 The window grows or shrinks while you drag the mouse.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new size of the 
window.

Closing a window
When you finish viewing or editing any information displayed in a window, 
you can close the window to keep it from cluttering the screen. To close a 
window, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Close button (the little red button) of the window you want 
to close.
	
	 If you haven’t saved the information inside the window, such as a letter 
you’re writing with a word processing program, the application displays 
a dialog that asks whether you want to save it.
	
2.	 In the dialog that appears, click one of the following choices:
 
• Don’t Save: Closes the window and discards any changes you made 
to the information inside the window.
 
• Cancel: Keeps the window open.
 
• Save: Closes the window but saves the information in a file. If this is 
the first time you’ve saved this information, another dialog appears, 
giving you a chance to name the file and to store the saved informa­
tion in a specific location on your hard drive. 
	
Computers typically offer two or more ways to accomplish the same task, so 
you can choose the way you like best. As an alternative to clicking the Close 
button, you can also click inside the window you want to close and then 
choose File➪Close or press Ô+W. 
Minimizing a window
Sometimes you might not want to close a window, but you still want to get 
it out of the way so it doesn’t clutter your screen. In that case, you can mini­
mize a window, which tucks the window (displayed as a tiny icon) into the 
right side of the Dock, as shown in Figure 3-10. 
	
Figure 3-10: 
Minimized 
window 
icons on the 
Dock.
	

44
Getting to Know the Mac User Interface
	
A minimized window icon on the Dock actually displays the contents of that 
window. If you squint hard enough (or have a large enough screen), you can 
see what each minimized window contains. 
To minimize a window, choose one of the following:
	
✦	 Click the Minimize button of the window you want to tuck out of the way.
	
✦	 Click the window you want to minimize and choose Window➪Minimize 
(or press Ô+M).
	
✦	 Double-click the window’s title bar. (This feature can be turned off, as I 
explain later in this section.)
To open a minimized window, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Move the mouse over the minimized window on the Dock.
	
2.	 Click the mouse button. 
	
	 Your minimized window pops back onto the screen.
Zooming a window
If a window is too small to display information, you can instantly make it 
bigger by using the Zoom button — the green button in the upper-left corner 
most windows. (When you move the mouse over the Zoom button, a plus 
sign appears inside.)
Zooming a window makes it grow larger, as shown in Figure 3-11. Clicking the 
zoom button a second time makes the window shrink back to its prior size.
	
Sometimes when you click the zoom button the window appears to expand 
only slightly but doesn’t fill most of the screen. Other times clicking the 
zoom button makes a window fill the screen. To adjust how much or how 
little a window zooms in or out, you can resize the window, as described in 
the earlier section, “Resizing a window.”
Scrolling through a window
No matter how large you make a window, it may still be too small to display 
the entire contents of the information contained inside. Think of a window 
as a porthole that lets you peek at part, but not all, of a file’s contents. If 
a window isn’t large enough to display all of the information inside it, the 
window lets you know by displaying vertical or horizontal scroll bars.

Figure 3-11: 
The Zoom 
button

You can scroll what’s displayed in a window three ways, as shown in 
Figure 3-12:
	
✦	 Click the scroll arrows: Scrolls the window up/down or right/left. If you 
move the mouse over a scroll arrow and hold down the mouse button, 
the window continuously scrolls.
	
✦	 Drag the scroll box: Scrolls through a window faster.
	
✦	 Click in the scroll bar: Scrolls up/down or right/left in large increments 
or directly to the spot where you click.
	
To set how your Mac scrolls when you click the scroll bar, choose Ú➪System 
Preferences➪Appearance; then click either Jump to the Next Page or Jump 
to the Spot That’s Clicked to set the Click In the Scroll Bar To option.

46
Getting to Know the Mac User Interface
	
Many mice have a built-in scroll wheel in the middle. By rolling this scroll 
wheel, you can scroll a window’s display up or down. The Apple Mighty 
Mouse has a scroll ball in the middle that lets you roll it to scroll up/down or 
right/left. On new and recent MacBook models, you can scroll up, down, left, 
and right (and even in circles!) by dragging two fingers on the trackpad in 
whatever direction you want to scroll.
	
Depending on your Mac model, your Mac’s keyboard may have dedicated 
Page Up and Page Down keys, which you can press to scroll what’s dis­
played up and down. Not seeing Page Up and Page Down keys on your Mac 
or MacBook keyboard doesn’t mean they aren’t there. To use your Mac’s 
invisible Page Up and Page Down keys, refer to the subtopic “Arrow keys,” in 
the preceding section “The parts of a keyboard.”

Using the Toolbar button
Some windows display a row of icons at the top of the window, known as 
a toolbar. The purpose of a toolbar is to give you one-click access to com­
monly used commands, such as saving or printing a file. However, these 
toolbar icons can also clutter the appearance of a window.
To give you the option of hiding (or viewing) a window’s toolbar icons, a 
window might display a Toolbar button in its upper-right corner, as shown 
in Figure 3-13, but not all windows have a Toolbar button. 
Some programs, such as Microsoft Word, let you Control-click on a toolbar 
to choose other toolbars you may want to see (or hide open toolbars you 
don’t want to see). Control-clicking on your Mac’s Safari Web browser tool­
bar displays a pop-up menu with the Customize Toolbar command, which 
you can choose to display a window of toolbar icons you can drag to (or 
from) the Safari toolbar to make it look the way you want.
Manipulating windows with Exposé
The more windows you open, the more cluttered your screen can appear, 
much like taking stacks of paper and throwing them all over your desk. To 
organize your windows, you could move, resize, and minimize each window 
individually, but that’s too tedious and time-consuming. As a faster alterna­
tive, you can use a handy feature called Exposé.

The Toolbar 
button can 
display 
(left) or hide 
(right) a 
window’s

48
Getting to Know the Mac User Interface
	
If your Mac’s Exposé key doesn’t respond when you press it, flip back to the 
section “Special feature and function keys” to change the way your Mac’s 
keyboard responds to those keys when you press them.
The whole idea behind Exposé is to give you these fast, convenient ways to 
organize your windows:
	
✦	 Shrinking all windows to the size of thumbnail images so you can see 
and choose the window you want to use, as shown in Figure 3-14. The 
Exposé key, dedicated to the F3 key, bears an icon of a minidesktop and 
windows. Pressing the Exposé key does the shrinking for you. You can 
also press Fn+F9 to activate Exposé.
	
✦	 Showing only those windows that belong to the active program, as 
shown in Figure 3-15. Pressing Fn+F10 is the trick here (or pressing 
Ctrl+F3).
	
✦	 Hiding all windows so you can see what’s on the Desktop. Pressing 
Fn+F11 (or Ô+F11) pulls out the old invisibility cloak.

Pressing 
Fn+F10

windows 
except for 
the active 
program 
(the name 
that appears 
in the 
Application 
menu).
	
	
Pressing the Exposé key, Fn+F9, Fn+F10, and Fn+F11 toggles the display. So 
pressing Fn+F9 initially shrinks all windows as thumbnail images, but press­
ing Fn+F9 a second time reverts all windows to normal size.
When windows appear as thumbnail images after you press Fn+F9 or Fn+F10, 
you can move the pointer over the thumbnail image and view the filename 
that appears in that particular window.
To switch to a window, click the thumbnail image of that window. Exposé 
immediately displays your chosen window (at full size) on the screen.
Playing with Icons in the Dock and Finder
A Mac shows programs and files as pictures, or icons. Program icons are 
visual depictions of the program, such as the postage stamp icon that repre­
sents the Mail program, or the calendar icon that represents the iCal sched­
ule program.

50
Playing with Icons in the Dock and Finder
File icons typically contain the filename along with a picture that corre­
sponds to the program that created it. By providing this visual clue, you can 
see which specific programs created the files.
Icons commonly appear on the Desktop, in the Dock, and inside a Finder 
window, as shown in Figure 3-16.
The Desktop
The Desktop is always onscreen, although open windows cover up part or all 
of it. In the old days, placing program and file icons on the desktop for quick 
access was common, much like placing an important book or day planner in 
one corner of your desk so you can grab it easily.
Unfortunately, the more icons you store on the Desktop, the more cluttered 
it appears, making it harder to find anything. Although you can still store 
program and file icons on the Desktop, storing program and folder icons in 
the Dock and in folders in the Finder is more common.
	
Figure 3-16:

common 
locations 
where you

51
Playing with Icons in the Dock and Finder
The Desktop generally shows an icon that represents your hard drive. If you 
have any additional storage devices attached to your Mac (such as an exter­
nal hard drive, a CD or DVD, or a USB flash drive), you typically see icons for 
those storage devices on your Desktop, too.
	
You can change what your Mac displays on the Desktop. To do so, click the 
Finder icon in the Dock, click the Finder menu, and then choose Preferences. 
In the Finder Preferences window, check, uncheck, or change the different 
options to suit your style.
The Dock
The Dock is a rectangular strip that contains both program icons and file 
and folder icons. To help keep your icons organized, the Dock places pro­
gram icons on the left side of a divider and file icons on the right side, as 
shown in Figure 3-17.
	
Figure 3-17: 
The Dock 
can hold 
many icons.

Divider
Besides acting as a convenient place to store and find frequently used pro­
grams and files, the Dock can also tell you which programs are running by 
displaying a glowing dot under the icon of each running program. Clicking a 
running program’s Dock icon gives you a quick and easy way of bringing that 
program and any of its windows to the front of any other program windows.
Moving the Dock
The Dock initially appears at the bottom of the screen, but you can move it 
to the left or right of the screen. (You can’t move the Dock to the top or else 
it would cover the menu bar.)
To move the Dock to a new location, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪Dock.

52
Playing with Icons in the Dock and Finder
	
	 A submenu appears, as shown in Figure 3-18.

the Dock on

2.	 Click a new position — Left, Bottom, or Right. 
	
	 A check mark appears next to your selection, and the Dock makes its 
move.
Resizing the Dock
The Dock grows each time you add more program and file icons to it. 
However, you might want to modify the size of the icons on the Dock so that 
the Dock as a whole doesn’t appear too small or too large. To resize the 
Dock, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪Dock➪Dock Preferences.
	
	 The Dock preferences window appears, as shown in Figure 3-19.
	
Figure 3-19:

3.	 Click the Close button of the Dock preferences window.
	
	 The individual icons on the Dock are resized according to your wishes.
	
Another way to resize the Dock is to move the pointer over the Dock divider, 
hold down the mouse button, and drag the mouse left or right. (If you have a 
two-button mouse, hold down the left mouse button.)
Magnifying the Dock
When you shrink the size of the Dock to hold more icons, the icons can 
appear too small, and it can be hard to see which icon the mouse is pointing 
at. Fortunately, the name of the program beneath the pointer appears to tell 
you what program it is. To make Dock icons zoom in size when you move the 
pointer over them, you can turn on Magnification, as shown in Figure 3-20.
	
Figure 3-20: 
Magni­
fication 
makes an 
icon on the 
Dock easier 
to see.
	
To turn magnification of the Dock on or off, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪Dock➪Dock Preferences. 
	
	 The Dock preferences window appears. (Refer to Figure 3-19.)
	
2.	 Select (or clear) the Magnification check box.
	
3.	 Drag the Magnification slider to adjust the magnification of the Dock.
	
4.	 Click the Close button of the Dock preferences window.
	
For a fast way to turn Magnification on or off, choose Ú➪Dock➪Turn 
Magnification On (Off).
Hiding the Dock

54
Playing with Icons in the Dock and Finder
The Dock might be convenient, but it can take up precious screen real estate 
when you view Web pages or work with lengthy word processing docu­
ments. To get all the advantages of the Dock without the disadvantage of 
using extra screen space to display the Dock all the time, you can hide the 
Dock.
Hiding the Dock means that the Dock tucks itself out of sight, but as soon as 
you move the mouse near the edge of the screen where the Dock is located 
(bottom, left, or right), the Dock pops into view.
To hide (or show) the Dock, click the Apple menu and choose Dock➪Turn 
Hiding On (Off).
You find out how to customize the icons on the Dock in Book I, Chapter 4.
The Finder
The Finder is a program that lets you find, copy, move, rename, delete, 
and open files and folders on your Mac. You can run programs directly 
from the Finder, but the Dock makes finding and running programs much 
more convenient.
The Finder runs all the time. To switch to the Finder, click the Finder icon in 
the Dock (the Picasso-like faces icon on the far left of the Dock).
Sometimes when you switch to the Finder, you might not see a Finder window. 
Clicking the Finder icon a second time in the Dock opens a new Finder 
window. You can also open a new Finder window by choosing File➪New 
Finder Window. You can open as many Finder windows as you want, although 
it’s common just to have one or a few Finder windows open at a time.
The Finder window looks different from the windows of other programs. 
Because the Finder helps you manage the files stored on your hard drive, a 
Finder window consists of two panes, as shown in Figure 3-21.
The left pane, called the Sidebar, displays four different categories:
	
✦	 Devices: Lists all the storage devices connected to your Mac, such as 
hard drives, flash drives, and CD/DVD drives.
	
✦	 Shared: Lists all shared storage devices connected on a local area 
network.

appear as icons with text labels, regardless of which type of view you’ve 
chosen to view the Finder window.
You find out how to use the Finder in more detail in Book I, Chapter 6.
Getting Help
Theoretically, the Mac should be so easy and intuitive that you can 
teach yourself how to use your computer just by looking at the screen. 
Realistically, the Mac can still be confusing and complicated. Thankfully, 
your Mac includes a built-in Help feature. Any time you’re confused using 
your Mac, try looking for answers in Mac Help — you just might find the 
answer you’re looking for!

56
Getting Help
Mac Help offers two types of help. First, it can point out specific menu com­
mands to choose for accomplishing a specific task. For example, if you want 
to know how to save or print a file, Mac Help will point out the Save or Print 
command so you’ll know which command to choose.
Second, Mac Help can provide brief explanations for how to accomplish a 
specific task. By skimming through the brief explanations, you can (hope­
fully) figure out how to do something useful.
Pointing out commands to use
To use Mac Help to point out commands you can use with the Finder or a 
program you’re running, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Help menu at the far right end of the menu bar for any pro­
gram you’re running (or click the Finder icon to switch to the Finder 
and then click Help).
	
	 A Search text box appears.
	
2.	 Begin typing a word or phrase.
	
	 If you want help on working with using printing, for example, type print. 
While you type, a list of possible topics appears, as shown in Figure 3-22.
	
	 Help topics for the program you’re running appear first under the Menu 
Items category, followed by the Help Topics category, which lists topics 
for the Finder and any other programs stored on your Mac.
	
3.	 Move your pointer over a Menu Items topic.
	
	 A floating arrow points to the command on a menu to show you how to 
access your chosen topic for the program you are running, as shown in 
Figure 3-23.
	
When accessing the Help feature of specific programs, you see a Help 
window, as shown in Figure 3-24.

A
fter you power on your Mac and have the OS X operating system up 
and running, you can run any additional programs, such as a word 
processor, a video game, a Web browser, or an e-mail program. The number 
of programs you can load and run simultaneously is limited only by the 
amount of hard drive space and memory installed inside your Mac.
This chapter explains how to run, install, and uninstall software — also 
referred to as programs, or applications — for your Mac. Of course, before 
you install any software, you want to know how to run the programs that 
come with your Mac. When you’re comfortable running your Mac’s bundled 
software, you can then find new programs to install. 
Because you have a physical limit on the amount of software you can install 
on your Mac, you have two choices. One, you can get another hard drive 
(an external drive or a larger internal drive) so you can keep installing more 
programs. Two, you can delete some programs that you don’t want or need, 
which makes room for more programs that you do want and need.
Launching a Program
Running a program or application is also referred to as launching a program 
or application, or starting up a program or application. Very hip Mac users 
shorten the term by saying they run this app or that app.

60
Launching a Program
To start a program, you can choose any of the four most common methods:
	
✦	 Click a program or document icon in the Dock.
	
✦	 Double-click a program or document icon in the Finder.
	
✦	 Choose a program name from the Apple menu’s Recent Items.
	
✦	 Find the program with the Spotlight search feature and then select it to run.
The next few sections take a closer look at each one of these methods.
	
Two other not-so-obvious but nifty ways to launch programs include attach­
ing a device (such as a digital camera or mobile phone with a camera to 
automatically launch iPhoto) or inserting a disc (such as a DVD or CD to 
automatically launch iTunes), and then Control-clicking (or right-clicking, if 
your mouse has a right button) on a document and choosing Open or Open 
With from the shortcut menu.
From the Dock
To run a program from the Dock, just click the program icon that you want 
to run. (What? Were you expecting something difficult?) The Dock contains 
icons that represent some (but not all) of the programs installed on your 
Mac. When you turn on your Mac for the first time, you see that the Dock 
already includes a variety of programs that Apple thinks you might want to 
use right away. However, you can always add or remove program icons from 
the Dock (more on that later).
When using programs, you can use the Dock in several ways:
	
✦	 To gain one-click access to your favorite programs.
	
✦	 To see which programs are running.
	
✦	 To switch between different programs quickly.
	
✦	 To see which windows you have minimized. (Minimized windows are 
tucked out of sight but still open.)
	
✦	 To view a specific program window.
	
✦	 To hide all windows that belong to a specific program.
Your Mac displays a glowing dot underneath the icon of running programs. 
By glancing at the Dock, you can identify all running programs quickly. (See 
Figure 4-1.)

Running programs
Clicking a running program’s Dock icon makes it easy to switch between all 
of the programs you’re running at the same time. So, if you want to switch to 
the iTunes program from the GarageBand program, you just click the iTunes 
program icon. Doing so immediately displays the iTunes window(s) and dis­
plays the iTunes program name in the Application menu on the menu bar at 
the top of the screen. (Clicking the iTunes program icon brings iTunes to the 
fore, but the GarageBand program doesn’t quit on you; it just moseys to the 
background, waiting for its turn to step into the limelight again.)
	
The Dock identifies running programs by displaying a glowing dot underneath 
the icon of each running program. The Application menu on the menu bar iden­
tifies the active program. You can have multiple programs running, but you 
can have only one active program. The active program is the one that is front 
and center on your screen, ready to accept any data or commands you give.
You can add or remove program icons from the Dock so it contains only the 
programs you use most often, and you can arrange the icons in the Dock to 
suit yourself and make starting programs even easier. The following sections 
give you all you need to know about the relationship between the Dock and 
its icons.
Adding program icons to the Dock
The Dock includes several programs already installed on your Mac, but if 
you install more programs, you might want to add those program icons to 
the Dock as well. One way to add a program icon to the Dock is to click and 
drag the icon onto the Dock. Here’s how that’s usually done:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock and then click the Applications 
folder in the Finder window’s sidebar.
	
	 The Finder displays the contents of the Applications folder.
	
2.	 Click the program icon and hold down the mouse button, drag the 
pointer where you want to place the icon in the Dock, and then 
release the mouse button.
	
	 Your chosen program icon now has its own place in the Dock.

62
Launching a Program
	
Make sure you drag program icons in the Dock to the left of the divider, which 
appears as a gap near the Trash icon. To the left of the divider, you see pro­
gram icons. To the right of the divider, you can store file or folder icons. 
	
Be careful not to drag the program icon to the Trash bin unless you really 
want to delete it from your hard disk.
	
When you drag a program icon to the Dock, you aren’t physically moving 
the program from the Applications folder onto the Dock; you’re just creat­
ing a link, or alias, from the Dock to the actual program (which is still safely 
stashed in its folder).
You can also add a program icon to the Dock right after you load a program. 
Remember that the Dock displays the icons of all running programs at all 
times, but when you exit a program, that program’s icon — if it’s not one of 
Apple’s Chosen Few and you haven’t added it to the Dock — will disappear 
from the Dock. To keep an icon of a running program in the Dock so it stays 
there when you quit the program, Control-click the running program’s icon 
in the Dock — or click and hold down on the program icon, and choose Keep 
in Dock from the shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 4-2. Now when you exit 
from this program, the program icon remains visible in the Dock.
	
Figure 4-2:

icon in the 
Dock to

shortcut

Rearranging program icons in the Dock
After you’ve placed program icons in the Dock, you might want to rearrange 
their order. How you rearrange your Dock is up to you! To rearrange pro­
gram icons in the Dock, click the program icon that you want to move and 
drag the mouse sideways to where you want to move it; then release the 
mouse button.
You notice that while you move a program icon, the existing icons move 
to the side to show you where the icon will appear when you let go of the 
mouse button. Neat effect, right?

Chapter 4
Running, Installing, 
and Uninstalling 
Programs
63
Launching a Program
	
You can rearrange program icons on the Dock how you want, but one icon 
you cannot move or remove is the Finder icon, which won’t budge no matter 
how hard you try to drag it from its Number One position on the Dock.
Removing program icons from the Dock
If you keep adding program icons to the Dock, eventually, you find that you 
rarely use some of these programs. Rather than let them clutter your Dock, 
it’s better to get rid of them. You have two ways of removing a program icon 
from the Dock:
	
✦	 Click the program icon that you want to remove from the Dock and drag 
it up and away from the Dock; then release the mouse button. Your 
unwanted program icon disappears in an animated puff of smoke.
	
✦	 Control-click the program icon and choose Remove from Dock from the 
shortcut menu.
Note: Removing a program icon from the Dock doesn’t remove or delete the 
actual program. To do that, see the “Uninstalling Software” section, later in 
this chapter.
	
If you like having a program icon in the Dock but want to make room for 
other programs, you can store program icons in a folder and then store 
that folder on the right of the divider in the Dock, thanks to a feature called 
Stacks. Now to load that program, you can click its folder icon in the Dock 
and then click the program icon. To find out more about using Stacks to add, 
remove, and work with folders on the Dock, check out Book I, Chapter 5.
	
A couple of things you can’t do:
	
✦	 You can never remove the Finder and Trash icons from the Dock.
	
✦	 You can’t remove a program icon from the Dock if the program is still 
running.
By double-clicking icons
The Mac represents a file as a graphically descriptive icon with a name. 
Icons can represent two types of files: programs and documents. 
Program files represent software programs that actually do something, such 
as play a game of chess or send, receive, and organize your e-mail. Document 
files represent data created by software programs, such as a letter created 
by a word processor, a business report created by a presentation applica­
tion, or a movie created by a video-editing program.

64
Launching a Program
Program icons are often distinct enough to help you identify the type of 
program they represent. For example, the iTunes program icon appears as 
a musical note over a CD, the iPhoto icon appears as a camera over a photo­
graph, and the Mail program icon (for sending and receiving e-mail) appears 
as a postage stamp.
Document icons often appear with the icon of the program that created them 
or as thumbnail images of their content, as shown in Figure 4-3. So, if you 
save a Web page in Safari, your file appears as a page with the Safari icon 
over it.
	
Figure 4-3: 
Document 
icons 
usually 
display 
either 
thumbnail 
images 
of their 
content or 
the icon of 
the program 
that created 
them.
	
	
A third type of icon you might see is an alias icon, which represents a link to 
a program icon or a document icon. You find out more about alias icons in 
the “Working with Alias Icons” section, later in this chapter.
Double-clicking a program icon
Because a program’s icon might not appear in the Dock, you have to be able 
to access icons another way. Luckily, you can find program icons by look­
ing for them using the Finder. (You can find most programs stored in the 
Applications folder, but the Finder can help you find any programs that are 
stored in another folder.)
	
It’s actually possible to store a program icon in any folder on your hard 
drive, but you should always store programs in the Applications folder. 
That way, if you need to find that program again, you just have to look in 
the Applications folder instead of trying to remember whether you stored it 
somewhere else. 

Book I 
Chapter 4
Running, Installing, 
and Uninstalling 
Programs
65
Launching a Program
To run a program by double-clicking its icon, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock and then click the Applications 
folder in the Finder window’s sidebar to display the programs 
installed on your Mac.
	
2.	 Scroll through the Applications folder window until you see the pro­
gram icon you want and then double-click the icon to run the program 
(you can also choose File➪Open, or Ô+O, or Ô+↓).
	
	 (You might have to double-click a folder that contains a program icon.)
	
	 Your chosen program appears, typically with a blank window, ready for 
you to do something programmy — such as typing text.
	
Here are a couple of shortcuts for you to try:
	
✦	 Click your Mac’s Desktop and press Ô+Shift+A to open your Mac’s 
Applications folder.
	
✦	 Typing the first letter of a program file or document you are looking 
for in any Finder window will instantly jump to and select the first icon 
that matches the letter you type. For instance, to locate Safari in the 
Applications folder quickly, press S to jump to and select Safari (or 
another program icon whose name starts with S that might come before 
Safari, if one is present).
Double-clicking a document icon
When you double-click a program icon, you start (that is, run or launch) that 
particular program. Unfortunately, if you want to use your newly opened 
program to work on an existing file, you then have to search for and open 
that file by using the program’s File➪Open command. 
As an alternative to running a program and then having to find and open the 
file you want to work with, the Mac gives you the option of double-clicking 
the document icon you want to open. When you double-click a document 
icon, your Mac typically opens the program that created that document and 
then loads that document in the program window.
	
Sometimes if you double-click a document icon, an entirely different pro­
gram loads and displays your file. This can occur if you save your file in a dif­
ferent file format. For example, if you save an iMovie project as a QuickTime 
file, double-clicking the QuickTime file opens the QuickTime Player instead 
of iMovie.
	
Think of double-clicking a document icon as equivalent to the two-step pro­
cess of first opening a program and then opening the document you want to 
view or revise. 

66
Launching a Program
To double-click a document icon, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock and then click the Documents folder 
in the sidebar (or double-click the Documents folder icon on the right 
side of the Finder window) to open the Documents window.
	
2.	 Scroll through the Documents window until you see the document 
icon you want and then double-click it.
	
	 (You might need to double-click one or more folders until you find the 
document you want.)
	
	 Your Mac loads the program that created the document (if it’s not 
already running) and displays your chosen document in a window. If 
your Mac can’t find the program that created the document, it might 
load another program, or it might ask you to choose an existing program 
on your Mac that can open the document.
	
Here are a couple of other ways you can quickly access your Mac’s 
Documents folder:
	
✦	 Click the Desktop and press Ô+Shift+D to open your Mac’s Documents 
folder.
	
✦	 Control-click the Documents icon in the Dock and choose “Open 
Documents” (or click and hold on the Documents icon to see the folders 
and documents inside it, move the pointer to the one you want to open, 
and then let go of the mouse button).
	
Although it’s possible to store document icons anywhere on your hard drive, 
it’s a good idea always to store documents inside the Documents folder so 
you’ll know where to start looking first.
From the Apple menu’s Recent Items
This one’s a no-brainer: Choose Ú➪Recent Items and then choose the appli­
cation you want to run from the list of recently run programs. You can also 
choose a recently created or viewed document or other file to automatically 
launch the associated program and load the document or file.
With Spotlight
As an alternative to clicking an application’s Dock icon, or locating a pro­
gram or document by clicking through folders, you can use your Mac’s 
handy Spotlight feature to quickly open programs or documents for you. 
There are two ways to use Spotlight to run programs and open documents.
To use the Finder to open a program or document with your Mac’s Spotlight 
feature, follow these steps:

Launching a Program
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock, click in the Search text box and type 
all or part of a document name (or the contents of a document you 
want to open), and then press Return.
	
	 A list of documents matching what you typed appears in the Finder, as 
shown in Figure 4-4.
	
2.	 Double-click the document you want to open.
	
	 Your Mac loads a program that displays the contents of your document 
in a window, ready for you to work with it.
	
Figure 4-4: 
The Search 
text box can

find any file, 
including

tracks, 
pictures, 
and e-mail 
messages.
	
To use the Spotlight menu bar icon to open a program or document with 
Spotlight, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Spotlight icon in the far right corner of your Mac’s menu bar 
(or press Ô+spacebar) and begin typing the first few letters of the pro­
gram name or file (or contents of a file) you’re looking for, as shown 
in Figure 4-5.
	
2.	 Move the pointer to the program or document you want to open and 
click the mouse.
	
	 When you select an application from the Spotlight list of matches, the 
program will run and a blank document will appear. When you select a 
document from the list of matches, the program will run and the docu­
ment you select will appear.

Working with Alias Icons
An alias icon acts like a link to another icon. Double-clicking an alias icon 
works identically to double-clicking the actual program or document icon. 
The biggest advantage of alias icons is that you can move and place alias 
icons anywhere you want without physically moving (and perhaps losing) a 
program or document icon. 
	
One way to use alias icons is to create alias icons to your program icons and 
then store those alias icons in a folder. Now store that folder to the right of 
the divider in the Dock, and you have easy access to lots of program icons 
without cluttering the Dock.
You can do the following things with alias icons:
	
✦	 Create an alias icon: Click the Finder icon in the Dock, click the icon you want 
to select, and then choose File➪Make Alias. (You can also Control-click it and 
choose Make Alias, or press Ô+L.) A copy of your chosen icon appears in the 
window with an arrow and alias added to its name, as shown in Figure 4-6.
	
✦	 Move an alias icon: Because it’s pointless to store the original icon and 
the alias icon in the same location, you should store the alias icon in a 
new location. To move an alias icon, click it to select it and then drag it 
to the Desktop or folder you want to move it to.
	
✦	 Delete an alias icon: Simply Control-click it and choose Move to Trash, or 
press Ô+Delete. Note that deleting an alias icon never deletes the original 
icon — meaning that if you delete an alias icon that represents a program, 
you never delete the actual program. The only way to delete a program or 
document is to delete the original program or document icon.

You can store alias icons on the Desktop for fast access, or in specific 
folders to organize documents without physically moving them to a new 
location. (Essentially, the Dock replaces the need to place alias icons on 
the Desktop, and Smart Folders duplicate the process of creating and stor­
ing alias icons in a folder. You find out how to use Smart Folders in Book I, 
Chapter 5.)
Switching between Programs
When you run multiple programs, you have multiple windows from different 
programs cluttering your screen, much like covering a clean tabletop with 
piles of different papers. To help keep your screen organized, you can switch 
between different programs (say a word processor and a Web browser) as 
well as switch to different windows displayed by the same program (such as 
a word processor displaying a window containing a letter of resignation and 
a second window containing a resume).
Your Mac offers quite a few different ways to switch between different pro­
grams, including using the Dock, using the Application Switcher, clicking 
a window of a different program, using Exposé, or by hiding programs or 
entire desktops (which I write about in Book I, Chapter 3). 
I discuss the first three ways of switching between running programs in the 
following list:

70
Switching between Programs
	
✦	 Using the Dock: Click a program icon in the Dock that has a dot under­
neath it. That’s all there is to it! If you want to switch to a specific docu­
ment window opened by a certain program, you can switch to that 
program and that document window at once. Control-click the icon of 
the program you want to switch to and then click the name of the docu­
ment you want to open. Easy peasy!
	
✦	 Using the Application Switcher: The Application Switcher is a feature 
that displays icons of all active programs. After you open the Application 
Switcher, choose the icon of the program you want to use by holding 
down the Ô key and pressing the Tab key repeatedly to move left to right 
from one running program to the next, as shown in Figure 4-7. When you 
release the Ô key, the chosen program moves to the front of your screen.
	
Figure 4-7: 
The 
Application 
Switcher 
displays 
icons of all 
currently 
running 
programs.
	
	
	 Pressing the Shift key while holding down Ô and pressing Tab will move 
the selection from right to left. You can also press Ô+Tab and then let 
go of the Tab key and use the arrow keys to navigate left and right.
	
	 If a program has several files open in different windows, the Application 
Switcher just switches you to that program, but you still have to find the 
specific window to view.
	
✦	 Clicking different windows: A fast, but somewhat clumsier way to 
switch between programs is to rearrange your windows so you can see 
two or more windows at one time, as shown in Figure 4-8. To switch to 
another window, click anywhere inside that window (or press Ô+`).
	
	 Save some mouse clicks by pressing Ô+` to switch between open win­
dows in a running program!
	
The Dock or the Application Switcher can switch to a specific program, but if 
that program has several open windows, you need to take time to search for 
the specific window you want to use. As a faster alternative, Exposé, shown 
in Figure 4-9, lets you view thumbnail versions of all your open windows 
from all running programs. Then all you have to do is click the exact window 
you want to use. To learn how to use Exposé, check out Book I, Chapter 3.

Quitting Programs
Quitting Programs
When you shut down a program, you also shut down all document windows 
that program may have open. However, if you only shut down a document in 
an open application, the program keeps running.
Closing a document
If you want to stop working with or viewing a specific document but want to 
keep the program running, you can close just that particular document. You 
have three different ways to close a document window:
	
✦	 Choose File➪Close.
	
✦	 Press Ô+W.
	
✦	 Click the Close button of the document window.
	
If you try to close a window before saving the file, a dialog appears, asking 
whether you want to save your file.
Shutting down a program
When you finish using a program, it’s a good idea to shut it down to free up 
your Mac’s memory to run other programs. The more programs you have 
running at the same time on your Mac, the slower your Mac can become, so 
always shut down programs if you don’t need them anymore.
To shut down a program, you have three choices:
	
✦	 Choose the menu associated with the application and choose Quit (such 
as iPhoto➪Quit iPhoto to shut down the iPhoto program).
	
✦	 Press Ô+Q.
	
✦	 Control-click the program icon in the Dock and choose Quit from the 
shortcut menu that appears.
	
If you try to shut down a program that displays a window containing a docu­
ment that you haven’t saved yet, a dialog appears, asking whether you want 
to save your file. 
Force-quitting a program
Despite the Mac’s reputation for reliability, there’s always a chance that a pro­
gram will crash, freeze, or hang, which are less-than-technical-terms for a pro­
gram screwing up and not reacting when you click the mouse or press a key. 
When a program no longer responds to any attempts to work or shut down, 
you might have to resort to a last-resort procedure known as a force-quit.

Organizing Multiple Desktops with Spaces
As the name implies, force-quitting makes a program shut down whether it 
wants to or not. You can force-quit a program two ways:
	
✦	 Choose Ú➪Force Quit (or press Ô+Option+Esc). The Force Quit dialog 
appears, as shown in Figure 4-10. Frozen or crashed programs might 
appear in the Force Quit dialog with the phrase (not responding) 
next to its name. Just click the program you want to force-quit and click 
the Force Quit button.
	
Figure 4-10: 
The Force 
Quit dialog 
shows 
you the 
names of 
all currently 
running 
programs.
	
	
✦	 Control-click a program icon in the Dock and choose Force Quit from 
the shortcut menu that appears. If the program hasn’t really crashed 
or if your Mac thinks the program hasn’t crashed, you won’t see a Force 
Quit option in this pop-up menu. In that case, you may want to wait a 
minute or so to give your Mac time to correct the seemingly hung-up 
program. If after waiting, the program still appears stuck but you don’t 
see the Force Quit option, hold down the Option key, Control-click a pro­
gram icon in the Dock, and then choose Force Quit.
	
If you force-quit a program, you will lose any data you changed right before 
the program suddenly froze or crashed. For instance, if I just performed Ô+S 
to save this chapter before writing this sentence, then performed a force-
quit, this sentence would be missing the next time I reopened this chapter. 
Organizing Multiple Desktops with Spaces
Spaces is a handy feature available since Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. Essentially, 
Spaces multiplies your Mac’s single display into up to 16 separate “virtual” 
screens, or Desktops. The main purpose of Spaces is to help organize mul­
tiple programs running at the same time. Rather than cram multiple pro­
gram windows on a single screen (Desktop), Spaces lets you store multiple 
programs in separate Desktops. One Desktop might contain only Internet 
programs, such as Safari and Mail, whereas a second Desktop might contain 
only Microsoft Word and the Mac’s built-in Dictionary program.

74
Organizing Multiple Desktops with Spaces
If one program has multiple windows open, you can store each program 
window on a separate Desktop. For example, if you have a word processor 
and open a personal letter and a business letter, you could store the per­
sonal letter window on one Desktop and the business letter window on a 
second Desktop.
	
Spaces creates multiple Desktops to create the illusion of multiple computer 
screens. Any configured settings will apply to all Desktops, such as the 
appearance of the Dock or a screensaver.
After you enable Spaces and define the total number of Desktops to create, 
you can view all your Desktops as thumbnail images. Then you can open and 
move windows from one Desktop to another.
Turning on Spaces and creating Desktops
Before you can use Spaces to switch between multiple Desktops, you have 
to turn on Spaces and create some Desktops. Initially, Spaces creates 
four Desktops, but you can add up to 16 Desktops if you want. The more 
Desktops you add the harder it can be to manage them all, so the trick is to 
pick the number of Desktops you can manage, such as two or three or four. 
Later, if you find that you need more Desktops, you can add more. Likewise, 
if you find that you created too many Desktops, you can delete some.
Turn on Spaces and create your desired number of Desktops by following 
these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then choose the Exposé & Spaces 
icon.
	
2.	 Click the Spaces tab in the top center of the pane (if it isn’t selected 
already) and then select the Enable Spaces check box, as shown in

3.	 Click the Plus or Minus icons in the Rows and Columns fields to 
change the number of Desktops (between 2 and 16).
	
	 The number of rows and columns you create defines how many 
Desktops you create, and how they’re arranged. You might choose, for 
instance, to create up to 16 Desktops in a single row, or arrange four 
Desktops in two rows of two columns (see Figure 4-11).
	
	 The layout of Desktops matters only when you switch between Desktops 
by using the Control key in conjunction with the arrow keys. If you 
arrange 16 Desktops in a row, switching from Desktop 2 to Desktop

Configuring Spaces
When you configure Spaces, you can define the number of Desktops to use 
and the shortcut keys to activate Spaces or switch to a specific Desktop.
From the Spaces pane of the Exposé & Spaces pane (refer to Figure 4-11), 
you can change the following settings to your liking:
	
✦	 Using a Spaces menulet: Select (or clear) the Show Spaces in Menu Bar 
check box. Selecting this check box displays a Spaces menulet on the 
right side of the menu bar that you click to switch between Desktops.
	
✦	 Activating Spaces: Choose a function key from the To Activate Spaces 
pop-up menu. The default Spaces function key is Fn+F3. You can hold 
down Shift, Control, Option, or Command — or a combination of these 
keys — to add additional keys to the Activate Spaces function key you 
choose from the pop-up menu.

76
Organizing Multiple Desktops with Spaces
	
	 Note: On most Mac keyboards, you must press the Fn key to activate 
a function key. Therefore, to use the Activate Spaces function key, you 
press Fn+F3.
	
✦	 Switching between Desktops: Choose a shortcut key from the To Switch 
between Spaces pop-up menu. The default is the Control+arrow keys 
combination.
	
✦	 Switching to a specific Desktop: Choose a shortcut key from the 
To Switch Directly to a Space pop-up menu. The default is the 
Control+number keys combination where the number key you press 
(1 through 0 for Desktops 1 through 10) identifies the number of the 
Desktop you want to view. To switch to Desktops beyond number 10, 
either use the Control+arrow keys shortcut described in the preceding 
bullet, or click the Spaces menulet on the menu bar to choose those 
Desktops.
	
✦	 Switch to a space with open windows: Click the When Switching to an 
Application, Switch to a Space with Open Windows for the Application 
check box to make a Space containing windows for a running applica­
tion with open document windows come to the front when you click that 
application’s icon.
Moving program windows to different Desktops
When you run a program, it appears in the Space you’re working in. So, if 
you’re in Space 1 and you run the Safari Web browser, Safari appears on the 
Desktop of Space 1. You can switch to another Space to launch another pro­
gram that appears in that space. Or, you can move a program’s window from 
one Space to another, so the window appears where you want.
You can move program windows to different Desktops by using the Spaces 
function key or by dragging a program window from one Desktop Space to 
another Desktop Space. To move a program window to a different Desktop 
by using the Spaces function key, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Press the Spaces function key (Fn+F3, unless you changed it) and then 
press Fn+F9.
	
	 Exposé displays every window as a thumbnail within each Desktop 
image, as shown in Figure 4-12.
	
2.	 Click and drag a program window from one Desktop to a different 
Desktop, release the mouse button, and then repeat for each program 
window you want to move to a different Desktop.
	
3.	 Click the Desktop that you want to use right now.
	
	 Your chosen Desktop expands to fill the screen.

gram window you want to move to another Desktop; while still hold­
ing down the mouse, drag the program window to the left, right, 
bottom, or top edge of your Mac’s screen and keep holding down until 
the Spaces switching indicator appears, as shown in Figure 4-13.
	
2.	 If the adjacent Desktop Space is the one you want to move to, release 
the mouse button, and begin working with the program window in the 
Desktop Space you moved to. Otherwise, continue holding down the 
mouse button and move to the left, right, top, or bottom edge of the 
screen to move to the next adjacent Desktop Space and repeat until 
you arrive on the Desktop Space you want to move to.
Switching Desktops
After you arrange program windows on each Desktop, you can switch to a 
different Desktop at any time by using one of the following methods:
	
✦	 Press Fn+F3 (or whatever function key you assigned to activate Spaces) 
and then click the thumbnail of the Desktop you want to switch to.
	
✦	 Click the Spaces menulet on the menu bar and choose a Desktop 
number from the drop-down menu.

✦	 Press the Control+arrow key combination to move left, right, up, and 
down until you arrive on the Desktop you want to switch to.
	
✦	 Press the Control+number key combination. (To view Desktop 1, for 
example, press Control+1.) With the Control+number key combination, 
you can switch to Desktops 1 through 10. To switch to Desktops 11 
through 16, use one of the above three methods.
Turning off Spaces
If you want to turn off Spaces, choose Ú➪System Preferences➪Exposé & 
Spaces, click the Spaces tab, and then deselect the Enable Spaces check box.
	
When you turn off Spaces, all your program windows return to a single 
Desktop. If you turn Spaces on again, your Mac remembers the number of 
Desktops you had before you turned Spaces off. If you restart your Mac 
while Spaces is displaying multiple Desktops, your Mac shuts down all 
windows in all Desktops. When your Mac starts up again, all your Desktops 
are empty.

Acquiring New Software Programs
Acquiring New Software Programs
You can find the more popular Mac programs packaged in pretty boxes that 
typically contain a single CD/DVD, a thin manual (if any), and a lot of air. 
Most of these commercial programs are written and sold by big companies, 
such as Apple, Microsoft, Intuit, and Adobe.
	
All new Mac programs are designed to run on today’s Macs with Intel pro­
cessors running the Mac OS X operating system. However, they cannot run 
any software designed for earlier Macs running OS X’s predecessor, OS 9, 
without the help of an additional program (such as SheepShaver, http://
gwenole.beauchesne.info/en/projects/sheepshaver).
No matter how big your local computer store is, it can offer only a fraction of 
all available Macintosh programs. For a much greater selection of software, 
you have to browse for Mac programs on the Web where you can find three 
types of software: commercial, shareware, and freeware/open source. The 
following list spells out how they differ:
	
✦	 Commercial software: Most companies that sell software through stores 
also sell the same commercial programs on the Web. Sometimes you can 
even get a discount if you buy the program directly from the publisher 
and download it via the Internet.
	
	 As a further enticement, many commercial programs on the Web often 
offer a trial version that you can download and use for a limited amount 
of time, such as 30 days. After your trial period is over, the program will 
either stop working or run with many features turned off. If you pay for 
the software, the publisher will send you a registration key that converts 
the trial program into a fully functional version. To find trial versions of 
programs, just visit the Web sites of different software publishers.
	
✦	 Shareware software: Usually, shareware programs are limited function­
ality, time-limited trial versions, or fully functional programs written by 
individuals or small companies. The idea is for you to try out the pro­
gram, and if you like it, you’re then supposed to pay for it.
	
✦	 Freeware software: Freeware programs are typically simple utilities or 
games, although some commercial companies distribute freeware pro­
grams to promote their other products. Sometimes companies offer a 
freeware version of a program and then sell a more advanced version of 
that same program. As the name implies, freeware programs are avail­
able for you to copy and use at no cost. Donationware is a term for a 
freeware program whose creator welcomes donations to help the devel­
oper cover the cost of maintaining and developing new versions of the 
program.

80
Installing Software
	
	 A variation of freeware programs is open source. Like freeware pro­
grams, open source programs can be copied and used without paying 
for them. The main difference is that open source programs let you 
modify the program yourself if you know the specific programming lan­
guage that the program is written in.
Table 4-1 lists some popular open source programs and their commercial 
equivalents.
	
Besides being free, many open source programs offer additional features 
that their commercial rivals lack.
For example, the Safari Web browser comes free with every Mac, but many 
Web sites are designed to work only when viewed through Internet Explorer 
or Firefox. If you use Safari, it’s possible that you won’t be able to view some 
Web sites correctly, so you might want to switch to Firefox (or at least keep 
Firefox on your hard drive) and if you run across a Web site that Safari can’t 
open, you can view that Web site in Firefox.
	
You can try tricking Web sites that don’t work correctly with Safari into 
thinking you’re running a different Web browser: To do so, turn on Safari’s 
Develop menu, and then click Develop➪User Agent and choose one of 
the other Web browser choices (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox). To 
turn on the Develop menu, click Safari➪Preferences to open the Safari 
Preferences window, and then click the Advanced tab and check the Show 
Develop Menu in Menu Bar check box.

Installing Software
The most common place to install software is inside the Applications folder, 
so you should specify that folder when installing software. Some programs 
store their program icon inside the Applications folder plain as day, but 
others hide their program icons within another folder.

Final Draft 
	
A program icon actually represents a folder containing multiple files. Hiding 
these details from you and letting you treat a folder of files as a single pro­
gram icon ensures that you can’t accidentally delete or move a single crucial 
file that the entire program needs to work. For the technically curious, you 

82
Installing Software
can see the hidden files tucked inside an application by Control-clicking the 
application icon and choosing Show Package Contents from the shortcut 
menu. You’re free to look around, but I strongly advise that you don’t delete, 
move, modify, or rename any of the files you see because doing so might 
render the program inoperable.
Installing software from a CD/DVD
Software bought from a store will probably come on a CD/DVD. When you 
insert the CD/DVD into your Mac, you might see nothing but a single pro­
gram icon, along with several other files labeled Read Me or Documentation.
Other times, you might insert a CD/DVD and see an icon labeled Install. 
When you see an Install icon, you need to run this installation program to 
install the program on your hard drive.
	
When installing software, your Mac might ask for your password — the 
one you set up when you created your user account. (For more on user 
accounts, see Book I, Chapter 6.) Requiring you to enter your password is 
your Mac’s way of attempting to prevent malicious computer viruses or 
Trojan horse programs from installing themselves without your knowledge. 
Requiring your password to install a program also keeps unauthorized 
people (such as your kids) from installing programs that you might not want 
on your Mac, or programs you want to approve of before allowing another 
user to install on your Mac.
	
Requiring you to enter your password to install a program doesn’t guaran­
tee a program you want to install doesn’t contain a virus or Trojan horse 
program. And although most programs you can install on your Mac are 
scanned for viruses and other nasty threats before they’re made available 
to download or run from a disc, installing an anti-virus protection program 
and taking additional steps to secure and protect your Mac is your safest bet 
when it comes to protecting your identity, your privacy, and the integrity 
of files and information on your Mac’s hard drive. I show you ways you can 
secure and protect your Mac from online threats in Book IV, Chapter 4.
Dragging a program icon off the CD/DVD
If you insert a program’s CD/DVD into your computer and just see a pro­
gram icon, you install the program by dragging the program icon into your 
Applications folder. To do this, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Insert the software CD/DVD into your Mac.
	
	 A window appears, showing the contents of the CD/DVD, as shown in 
Figure 4-14.

2.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock and then choose File➪New Finder 
Window (or press Ô+N).
	
	 A second Finder window appears, and is ready to do your bidding.
	
3.	 Move the CD/DVD window and the Finder so they appear side by side.
	
4.	 Click and drag the program icon displayed in the CD/DVD window to 
the Applications folder in the Finder Sidebar.
	
	 Doing so copies the program icon from the CD/DVD to the Applications 
folder.
Running an installer program
Instead of displaying a program icon, a CD/DVD might display an Install icon, 
as shown in Figure 4-15. The installer is simply a special program designed 
to copy a program from the CD/DVD and place it in your Applications folder, 
as well as other files to other folders on your Mac. 
To install software using an installer program on a CD/DVD, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Insert the software CD/DVD into your Mac, and look for an icon 
labeled Install in the window that appears showing the contents of the 
CD/DVD.
	
	 The Install icon typically looks like a cardboard box with its top opened up.
	
2.	 Double-click this Install icon and then click Continue on the dialog 
that appears asking whether you really want to continue installing.
	
3.	 Follow the on-screen instructions.

84
Installing Software
	
	 If you have multiple hard drives, the installation program might ask 
where to install the program. (Generally, you should choose your Mac’s 
built-in hard drive unless you have a reason to store the program else­
where.) Right before the program installs, you’re asked for your 
password.

DVD might

Installing software from the Web
Although you can buy software in a box from your local computer store, it’s 
becoming far more common to buy software directly from the Web. Not only 
does this save the publisher the time and expense of packaging a program 
in a fancy box and shipping it to a store, but it also gives you the software to 
use right away. 
When you download a program off the Internet, the program usually arrives 
as a DMG (disc image) file. Safari, Mac OS X’s default Web browser, stores all 
downloaded files in a special Downloads folder in your Home folder (unless 
you direct it to your Mac’s Desktop or another folder of your choosing). The 
Downloads folder also appears right next to the Trash icon in the Dock. (If 
you’re using a different browser, such as Firefox, you might need to define 
where it stores downloaded files.)
Distributing software as a DMG file is the most common way to compress 
files for sending via the Internet. A DMG file essentially copies the contents 
of an entire folder and smashes it into a single file. You can always identify 
a DMG file because its icon appears with a hard drive icon, and the name 
includes the three-letter .dmg extension, as shown in Figure 4-16.

Figure 4-16:

icon and

extension 
at the end

filename.
	
After you have a DMG file on your Mac, you’re set to install the software 
inside it. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the DMG file that contains the program you want to 
install on your Mac. (If a License Agreement window appears, click 
the Agree button.)
	
	 The DMG file displays a device icon on the Desktop and displays a 
Finder window that contains the program icon stored inside the DMG 
file, as shown in Figure 4-17.
	
2.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock, choose File➪New Finder Window, 
and then click and drag the program icon in the DMG Finder window 
to the Applications folder in the second Finder window.
	
	 Doing so installs the program in your Applications folder.
	
3.	 Control-click the DMG device icon on the Desktop, and when a short­
cut menu appears, choose Eject.
	
If a DMG file you double-click reveals a program’s installer icon instead of 
a program icon, double-click the program installer and follow the steps the 
installer displays.
	
When you open a DMG file, it creates a device icon, which acts like a sepa­
rate storage device. This device icon acts like a temporary disk so you can 
copy files from it. After you install a program from the DMG file, you might 
want to eject the DMG device icon just to clear it out of the way. (Leaving it 
on your Desktop won’t hurt anything.)

86
Installing Software
After you install a program on your Mac, you can always find it again by 
looking in the folder where you stored it, which is usually the Applications 
folder. At this point, you might want to add the program icon to the Dock 
or place an alias icon on the Desktop (see the earlier section “Working with 
Alias Icons”).

Uninstalling Software
If you no longer use or need a program, you can always remove it from your 
hard drive. By uninstalling a program, you can free up space on your hard 
drive. 
	
Before uninstalling a program, make sure you don’t uninstall a program that 
you might need after all.
Uninstalling a program can involve three parts:
	
✦	 Uninstalling the program: Uninstalling a program, either by dragging 
it to the Trash or running an accompanying uninstaller program, physi­
cally removes the program from your hard drive.
	
✦	 Deleting program icons/alias icons: When you delete a program, you 
don’t necessarily delete that program’s icon from the Dock or any alias 
icons that you created from that program icon. To delete a program’s 
alias icon from the Dock, click and drag the alias icon up and away from 
the Dock; then let go to make the alias icon disappear in a puff of smoke. 
To delete a program’s alias icon from the Desktop or inside a folder, 
click and drag the alias icon to the Trash; then click Finder➪Empty 
Trash to delete the alias icon (and any other items you may have 
dragged into the Trash bin).
	
✦	 Deleting program settings: Most programs store user settings in the 
Library folder, which is located inside your Home folder. When you 
uninstall a program by dragging it to the Trash, its user settings files — 
also referred to as program preferences — remain on your hard drive. 
Uninstalling a program using an accompanying uninstaller program 
sometimes deletes your user settings files automatically, or offers 
you the option to do so if you wish. Although not necessarily harm­
ful, you might want to delete a program’s user settings files off your 
hard drive to free up space for more programs or documents, and to 
ZIP, SIT, and other strange files
Occasionally, you might run across files with 
such extensions as ZIP, SIT, SEA, or RAR. 
These types of files are all different ways to 
pack multiple files into a single, compressed 
file. The Mac can recognize and open ZIP 
compressed files, but if you need to open other 
kinds of compressed files, you need to install 
and use a free program called StuffIt Expander 
(www.stuffit.com). The StuffIt Expander 
program can open most kinds of compressed 
files, even those compressed files originally 
created on Windows or Linux computers. Your 
Mac can create ZIP and DMG files (which you 
find out more about in Chapter 5 of this mini­
book), but, if you want to create other types of 
compressed files, such as SIT or RAR files, you 
have to get another program, such as the com­
mercial version of the StuffIt program.

88
Uninstalling Software
protect potentially personal information from prying eyes if you are 
giving away or selling the computer to another person. To delete a 
program’s user settings files from your Mac’s hard drive, check out the 
“Removing user setting files” section, a few pages ahead. 
	 	
	 If a program you want to uninstall comes with an uninstaller program, 
such as this one that comes with Microsoft Office:
 
 

Double-click it to uninstall your program rather than dragging it to the 
Trash. However, the next few sections give you a more detailed look at 
what’s involved when you uninstall a program by dragging it to the Trash.
Uninstalling a program
Uninstalling a Mac program is typically as simple as dragging and dropping 
its program icon into the Trash.
To uninstall a program, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Make sure the program you want to uninstall isn’t running. If it is run­
ning, shut it down by choosing the Quit command (Ô+Q) and then 
clicking the Finder icon in the Dock.
	
	 The Finder appears.
	
2.	 Click the Applications folder in the Finder Sidebar to display the pro­
grams installed on your Mac and then click the program icon or folder 
that you want to uninstall.
	
3.	 Choose File➪Move to Trash. (You can also drag the program icon or 
folder to the Trash icon in the Dock, or press Ô+Delete to move the 
program icon or folder to the Trash.)
	
	 In some cases, you might be prompted for your password when you 
move a program file to the Trash. If so, type in your password, then click 
OK or press Return. 
	
	 The Trash icon displays an image showing the Trash filled with crum­
pled papers.
	
	 Before emptying the Trash, make sure you permanently want to delete 
any other programs or documents you’ve might have dragged into 
the Trash. After you empty the Trash, any files contained therein are 
deleted from your hard drive permanently.
	
4.	 Choose Finder➪Empty Trash. (You can also Control-click the Trash 
icon and choose Empty Trash, or press Ô+Shift+Delete to empty the 
Trash.)
	
	 Adios, application!

Removing program icons from the Dock and Desktop
After you uninstall a program, it’s also wise to remove all Dock or alias icons 
because those icons will no longer work. To remove a program icon from the 
Dock, click the program icon that you want to remove, drag the icon up and 
away from the Dock, and then release the mouse button. Your chosen pro­
gram disappears in a puff of animated smoke.
	
If you created multiple alias icons of a program, click the Finder icon to 
open a new Finder window, click in the Spotlight text box, and then type 
the name of the program you uninstalled followed by the word alias, such 
as PowerPoint alias or Adium alias. The Finder will display the location of 
the specified alias icons, as shown in Figure 4-19. Hold down the Ô key, click 
each alias icon you want to delete, and then press Ô+Delete to move them to 
the Trash. Au revoir!

Removing user setting files
Almost every program creates special user setting files that contain custom 
settings and preferences for the program, such as the default font used to 
type text when you use the program or your choice of toolbar icons dis­
played by the program. When you uninstall a program by dragging it to the 
Trash, the program’s user setting files remain on your computer. 
The more unnecessary files you have cluttering your hard drive, the slower 
your Mac might perform because it needs to keep track of these unused 
files even though it isn’t using them anymore. To keep your Mac in optimum 
condition, you should delete the user setting files of programs you uninstall 
from your computer. You can do that manually, or you can buy a program to 
do it for you automatically. I explain both ways.

Uninstalling Software
Manually removing user setting files
Manually removing user setting files requires deleting individual files or 
entire folders from your Mac’s hard drive. This process isn’t difficult, though 
it can be tedious.
	
If you feel squeamish about deleting files that you don’t understand, don’t 
delete them without an expert’s help. If you delete the wrong files, you could 
mess up the way your Mac works.
Many programs store their user setting files in one or both of two folders: 
the Application Support folder and the Preferences folder. To find these two 
folders, click the Finder icon to open your Home folder, and then look inside 
the Library folder. Look inside both folders and click any icons or folders 
bearing the name of the program you uninstalled; then drag them to the 
Trash and choose File➪Empty Trash (or press Ô+Shift+Delete).

Because manually deleting user setting and preference files might seem 
scary and intimidating, you might prefer to remove these files automati­
cally. To do this, you need to buy and install a special uninstaller program. 
When you run an uninstaller program, you tell it which program you want to 
uninstall, and the uninstaller program identifies all the files used by that pro­
gram, as shown in Figure 4-20.

program, 
such as

W
hen you need to organize stuff scattered around the house, one 
strategy would be to toss everything in the middle of the floor. 
However, it’s probably easier to take a more organized approach by storing 
off-season clothes in one box, retired gadgets in another box, bills in one file 
folder (and receipts in another), and new books you want to read on your 
nightstand.
Computers work in a similar way. Although you could dump everything on 
the top level of your hard drive, it’s more helpful to divide your hard drive 
in a way that can help you sort and arrange your stuff in an orderly, easy to 
get to fashion. Instead of boxes or shelves, the Mac uses folders (which tech-
types such as yours truly also refer to as directories).
A folder lets you store and organize related files. The two most com­
monly used folders on your hard drive are the Applications folder and 
the Documents folder. The Applications folder contains programs; the 
Documents folder contains anything you create and save while using a pro­
gram, such as a letter created by a word processor.
Folders can contain files or even other folders. The whole purpose of folders 
is to help keep your files organized so you can find them again.

Using the Finder
Using the Finder
The main program for managing drives, files, and folders is the Finder. To 
access the Finder, click the Finder icon (the smiley face icon on the far left) 
in the Dock. The Finder is divided into two parts, as shown in Figure 5-1:
	
✦	 A left pane, containing the Sidebar, which is where you find a list of con­
nected storage devices as well as commonly used folders.
	
✦	 A right pane, containing the contents of the selected drive or folder. 
If you switch to List, Column, or Cover Flow view, the right pane also 
shows a hierarchy of files stored inside folders.

Understanding devices
The Devices category of the Sidebar lists all removable or nonremovable 
storage devices you can use for storing and saving files. Nonremovable 
devices are always connected to your Mac. Every Mac has one nonremov­
able device, which is the drive that your Mac boots from; typically, it’s an 
internal hard drive, which is named Macintosh HD.
A removable drive is any additional drive that you plug into your Mac, such 
as an external hard drive. If your desktop Mac has a second hard drive 
installed, it also appears in the list of devices. You can eject a removable 
drive when you no longer need to access it or want to take it with you. 
Ejecting a removable hard drive or USB memory keychain drive removes its 
icon from the Finder. However, you cannot eject a nonremovable drive. After 
you eject a removable external hard drive or USB memory keychain drive, 
you can physically disconnect it.

Book I

Files and Folders
93
Using the Finder
	
If you physically try to disconnect a removable drive before you eject it, 
your Mac might mess up the data on that drive. Always eject removable 
drives before physically disconnecting them.
Removable devices can be attached and disconnected at any time. Common 
types of removable devices are external hard drives, USB flash drives, and 
digital cameras. 
To connect a removable device to your Mac, just plug it in with the appropri­
ate FireWire or USB cable. 
To remove a removable device from a Mac, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock to open the Finder window and then 
click the Eject button next to the connected drive you want to remove 
in the Finder window sidebar.
	
	 If the removable device is a CD/DVD, your Mac ejects it. If the removable 
device is plugged into a USB (Universal Serial Bus) port or a FireWire 
port on your Mac, you physically have to disconnect the device.
	
2.	 Wait until the device’s icon disappears from the Finder.
	
3.	 Physically disconnect the device from your Mac.
	
Some other ways to choose the Eject command are
	
✦	 Click the device icon on the Desktop and choose File➪Eject.
	
✦	 Click the device icon and press Ô+E.
	
✦	 Control-click the device icon and choose Eject from the shortcut menu 
that appears.
	
✦	 Drag the device icon to Trash on the Dock (it turns into an Eject button); 
then let go of the mouse.
Understanding folders
All the data you create and save by using a program (such as a word pro­
cessing document or a photograph you copy from your digital camera to 
your Mac’s hard drive) is stored as a file. Although you can store files on any 
storage device, the more files you store on a single device, the harder to find 
the one file you want at any given time.
Folders help you organize and manage files on a storage device in a logical 
way. You can even store folders inside other folders. Initially, every Mac 
hard drive contains the following folders:
	
✦	 Applications: Contains all the software programs installed on your Mac.
	
✦	 Library: Contains data and settings files used by programs installed on 
your Mac.

94
Using the Finder
	
✦	 System: Contains files used by the Mac OS X operating system.
	
✦	 Users: Contains any files you create and save, including documents, pic­
tures, music, and movies.
	
Never delete, rename, or move any files or folders stored in the Library or 
System folders, or else you might cause your Mac (or at least some pro­
grams on your Mac) to stop working. Files in the Library and System folders 
are used by your Mac to make your computer work. If you delete or rename 
files in either folder, your Mac might not operate the way it’s supposed to, or 
worse, grind to a halt.
The Users folder contains the Home folder of each account for each person 
using your Mac, as shown in Figure 5-2. (See Book I, Chapter 6 for more infor­
mation about creating accounts.) Each Home folder consists of additional 
folders:
	
Figure 5-2: 
The typical 
hierarchy 
of folders 
dividing 
your Mac’s 
hard drive.
	
	
✦	 Desktop: Contains any program and document icons that appear on 
your Mac’s Desktop.
	
✦	 Documents: Contains any files you create and save using different pro­
grams. (You’ll probably want to organize this folder by creating multiple 
folders inside it to keep all your files organized in a logical, easy-to-
manage way.)
	
✦	 Downloads: Contains any files you’ve download from the Internet.
	
✦	 Library: Contains folders and files used by any programs installed on 
your Mac. (Note: There are two Library folders, one stored on the top 
level of your hard drive, and one stored inside your Home folder.)

Navigating through the Finder
	
✦	 Movies: Contains video files created by iMovie and certain other video 
playing or editing programs, such as Final Cut Express or QuickTime 
Player.
	
✦	 Music: Contains audio files, such as music tracks stored in iTunes, or 
created by Garage Band or another audio program such as Audacity.
	
✦	 Pictures: Contains digital photographs, such as those you import into 
iPhoto.
	
✦	 Public: Provides a folder that you can use to share files with other user 
accounts on the same Mac, or with other users on a local area network.
	
✦	 Sites: Provides a folder for storing any Web pages, such as those created 
with iWeb. 
Every drive (such as your hard drive) can contain multiple folders, and each 
folder can contain multiple folders. A collection of folders stored inside fold­
ers stored inside other folders is a hierarchy. It’s important to know how 
to view and navigate through a folder hierarchy (refer to Figure 5-2) to find 
specific files.
Navigating through the Finder
To access files you’ve stored on your Mac, you navigate through the dif­
ferent folders and devices by using the Finder. To navigate, you must first 
choose a connected drive or device and then you can open and exit folders 
or jump between specific folders. I explain each of these throughout these 
sections.
Opening a folder
After you choose a device, the Finder displays all the files and folders stored 
on that device. To open a folder (and move down the folder hierarchy), you 
have five choices:
	
✦	 Double-click the folder.
	
✦	 Click the folder and choose File➪Open.
	
✦	 Click the folder and press Ô+O.
	
✦	 Click the folder and press Ô+↓.
	
✦	 Control-click the folder and choose Open from the shortcut menu that 
appears.
	
Each time you open a folder within a folder, you’re essentially moving down 
the hierarchy of folders stored on that device.

96
Navigating through the Finder
Exiting a folder
After you open a folder, you might want to go back and view the contents of 
the folder that encloses the current folder. To view the enclosing folder (and 
move up the folder hierarchy), choose one of the following:
	
✦	 Choose Go➪Enclosing Folder.
	
✦	 Press Ô+↑.
	
✦	 Hold down the Ô key, click the Finder title bar to display a list of enclos­
ing folders, and then click an enclosing folder.
	
Click the Finder icon in the Dock, and then choose View➪Show Path Bar to 
display the series of folders that lead to a folder you’re currently viewing. 
Double-click on any of the folders in the series to switch to that folder’s view.
Jumping to a specific folder
By moving up and down the folder hierarchy on a device, you can view the 
contents of every file stored on a device. However, you can also jump to a 
specific folder right away by choosing one of these options:
	
✦	 Choose a folder from the Go menu, such as your Mac’s Utilities folder, 
for example, by choosing Go➪Utilities, or press Ô+Shift+U. Other folders 
listed in the Go menu can also be accessed by pressing the appropriate 
shortcut keys, which appear next to the folder name on the menu.
	
✦	 By clicking a folder displayed in the Sidebar.
	
✦	 Using the Go➪Recent Folders command to jump to a recently opened 
folder. (Using this command sequence displays a submenu of the last 
ten folders you visited.)
	
If you display the contents of a folder in List, Column, or Cover Flow views, 
you can view folder hierarchies directly in the Finder. (You find out more 
about using the List, Column, and Cover Flow views later in the “Organizing 
and Viewing a Folder” section.)
Jumping back and forth
While you navigate from one folder to the next, you might suddenly want to 
return to a folder for a second look. To view a previously viewed folder, you 
can choose the Back command as follows:
	
✦	 Click the Back arrow.
	
✦	 Choose Go➪Back.
	
✦	 Press Ô+[.

Book I 
Chapter 5
Working with  
Files and Folders
97
Organizing and Viewing a Folder
	
A command that lets you jump back to a previously opened folder is not the 
same thing as the Go➪Enclosing Folder command. If you opened an external 
drive and then switched to the Utilities folder on your hard drive, the Back 
command would return the Finder to the external drive, but the Go➪
Enclosing Folder command would open the Applications folder.
After you use the Back command at least once, you can choose the Forward 
command. The Forward command reverses each Back command you 
choose. To choose the Forward command, pick one of the following:
	
✦	 Click the Forward arrow.
	
✦	 Choose Go➪Forward.
	
✦	 Press Ô+].
Organizing and Viewing a Folder
The Finder shows the contents stored on a device, such as a hard drive, 
which acts like a giant folder. If your Mac’s hard drive contains a large 
number of files and folders, trying to find a particular file or folder can be 
frustrating. To organize a folder’s contents, the Finder can display the con­
tents of a folder in five views (shown in Figure 5-3), which I discuss through­
out this section.
To switch to a different view, in the Finder, choose View and then choose As 
Icons, As Lists, As Columns, or As Cover Flow — or just click one of the view 
icons shown in Figure 5-3.
Selecting items in the Finder
No matter how you view the contents of a folder, selecting items remains the 
same. You always have to select an item before you can do anything with it, 
such as copy or delete it. You can select items three ways:
	
✦	 Select a single item (file or folder) by clicking it.
	
✦	 Select multiple items by holding down the Ô key and clicking each item.
	
✦	 Selecting a range of items by clicking and dragging the mouse or by 
using the Shift key.
	
	 The Shift key trick works only in List, Column, or Cover Flow view. Just 
click the first item you want to select in your particular view, hold down 
the Shift key, and then click the last item in the range that you want to 
choose. Your desired range is selected, just like that.

Using Icon view
Icon view displays all files and folders as icons. To organize files in Icon 
view, you can manually drag icons around, or you can have your Mac auto­
matically arrange icons based on certain criteria, such as name or date 
modified.
To arrange icons within Icon view manually, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Move the pointer over an icon you want to move. 
	
	 You can select two or more icons by holding down the Ô key and click­
ing multiple icons.
	
2.	 Click and drag the mouse. 
	
	 Your selected icon(s) move when you move the mouse. 
	
3.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new location of 
your icon(s).
	
When you arrange icons manually, they might not align with one another. 
To fix this problem, make sure no items are selected and then choose View➪
Clean Up Selection to straighten them up.

Organizing and Viewing a Folder
	
Click and drag the Icon Size slider (refer to the lower-right corner of Figure 5-3) left 
or right to decrease or increase the display size of icons in the Finder window.
Manually arranging icons can be cumbersome if you have dozens of icons 
you want to arrange. As a faster alternative, you can arrange icons automati­
cally in Icon view by following these steps:
	
1.	 Choose View➪Arrange By. 
	
	 A submenu appears, as shown in Figure 5-4.
	
Figure 5-4: 
The Arrange 
By submenu 
lists 
different 
ways to 
organize 
your icons.
	
	
2.	 Choose one of the following options:
	
• Name: Arranges icons alphabetically.
 
•	 Date Modified: Arranges the most recently modified items at the top 
of the window.
 
• Date Created: Arranges the most recently created items at the top of 
the window.
 
•	 Size: Arranges the smallest sized files and folders at the top of the window.
 
• Kind: Arranges items alphabetically by file extension, clustering 
together Microsoft Word files, JPG picture files, and music tracks, for 
instance.
 
• Label: Arranges icons alphabetically by color. Icons with no color 
appear near the top of the window followed by icons colored blue, 
gray, green, orange, purple, red, and yellow.
Using List view
List view displays each item by name, size, date it was last modified, and the 
kind of item it is, such as a folder or a PDF (Portable Document Format) file. 
The biggest advantages of List view are that it always displays more items in 
the same amount of space than the Icon view, and it displays hierarchies of 
folders as indented items, as shown in Figure 5-5. 

100
Organizing and Viewing a Folder
	
Figure 5-5: 
List view 
displays 
items in 
rows and 
folders as 
hierarchies.
	
	
The List view also makes it easy to select multiple folders at one time by 
holding down the Ô key and clicking once on each folder you want to select. 
When you’re done selecting folders, you can then click and hold on one of 
the folders and drag them to wherever you want to move them.
	
Because List view can display the contents of two or more folders at one 
time, you can select files from multiple folders. Additionally, if you click a 
column heading in List view (such as Name or Date Modified), the Finder 
sorts your items in ascending or descending order.
List view identifies folders by a folder icon and a triangle symbol (which 
Apple officially refers to as a disclosure triangle) pointing to it. Clicking that 
triangle symbol expands that folder to display its contents — files, more 
folders, whatever. Clicking the triangle again collapses that folder to hide its 
contents.
Using Column view
Column view initially displays files and folders in a single column. As with 
List view, all folders display a triangle next to the folder name. (Okay, okay, 
in List view, the triangle is just to the left of the folder name, and Column 
view has the triangle at the far right, but you get to the idea.) Clicking a 
folder displays the contents of that folder in the column to the right, as 
shown in Figure 5-6.

	 An Options window appears.
	
2.	 Click the Arrange By pop-up menu (shown in Figure 5-7) and choose 
one of the following options:

Using Cover Flow view
Cover Flow view combines List view with the graphic elements of Icon view, 
as shown in Figure 5-8. Cover Flow originated from jukeboxes that let you 
pick songs by viewing and flipping through album covers. In the Finder, 
Cover Flow lets you choose files or folders by flipping through enlarged 
icons of those files or folders, which can make finding a particular file or 
folder easier.

Organizing and Viewing a Folder
To scroll through items in the Cover Flow view, you have a number of 
choices:
	
✦	 Click the left and right scroll arrows on the Cover Flow scroll bar (that 
appears below the enlarged icon preview images).
	
✦	 Drag the scroll box in the Cover Flow scroll bar.
	
✦	 Click in the scroll area to the left or right of the scroll box on the Cover 
Flow scroll bar.
	
✦	 Click an icon on either side of the icon preview image that appears in 
the middle of the Cover Flow view.
	
✦	 Press the up- and down-arrow keys to select a different file or folder in 
the list portion of the Cover Flow view. Each time you select a different 
file or folder, the Cover Flow icon for that file or folder appears.
Using Quick Look to view file contents
Quick Look is a nifty feature that enables you to see the contents of a file for 
many file types without having to run the program you use to create, view, 
and save it. Just select a file icon and then click the Quick Look view button 
(or press the spacebar) to display an enlarged preview icon of the selected 
file, as shown in Figure 5-9. You have three options to close the Quick Look 
display:
	
✦	 Click the Close button in the upper-left corner.
	
✦	 Press the spacebar.
	
✦	 Press the Escape key.
You can resize the Quick Look display by clicking and dragging the lower-
right corner of the Quick Look display or by clicking the Zoom arrows icon 
(bottom-center of the display), which fills the entire screen with the Quick 
Look display.
The Quick Look view behaves differently depending on the type of file you’re 
peeking into:
	
✦	 An audio file plays in its entirety so you can hear its contents.
	
✦	 A full-size picture file appears in a window so you can see what the pic­
ture looks like.
	
✦	 A movie file plays in its entirety so you can see and hear its contents.
	
✦	 PDF (Portable Document Format) files and HTML files (Web pages) 
appear in a window so you can scroll through the files and read their 
contents.

Creating Folders
In addition to letting you navigate your way through different folders, the 
Finder also lets you create folders. The main purpose for creating a folder 
is to organize related files and folders together. You create a folder in the 
Finder or the Save As dialog. The next sections walk you through each 
method.
Creating a folder using the Finder menu
You can create a folder anywhere, although the first place you’re likely to 
create a folder is inside the Documents folder to organize your files. You 
might create multiple folders named Word Processor Files, Spreadsheets, 
and Databases. Or, you might create multiple folders based on topics, such 
as 2010 Tax Info, which might contain a mix of word processor, spreadsheet, 
and database files. The way you organize your folders is up to you.

Creating Folders
To create a folder by using the Finder menu, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
	
	 The Finder appears.
	
2.	 In the Sidebar of the Finder, click the Places location, such as Desktop 
or your Home folder (or click a device, such as an external USB 
memory keychain, where you want to create a folder).
	
3.	 Navigate to and open the folder where you want to store your new 
folder, such as inside the Documents folder.
	
4.	 Choose File➪New Folder (or press Ô+N).
	
	 An untitled folder icon appears with its name selected.
	
5.	 Type a descriptive name for your folder and then press Return.
	
	 Your new folder is christened and ready for use.
Creating a folder through the Save As dialog
The Finder isn’t the only way to create a new folder. When you save a file for 
the first time or save an existing file under a new name (using the Save As 
command), you can also create a new folder to store your file at the same 
time. To create a folder within the Save As dialog, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Create a new document in any program, such as TextEdit.
	
2.	 Choose File➪Save As. 
	
	 A Save As dialog appears, as shown in Figure 5-10

3.	 Click the Arrow button to the right of the Save As text box.
	
	 The Save As dialog expands to display your Mac’s storage devices and 
common folders.
	
4.	 In the Sidebar of the dialog, click the device where you want to create a 
folder and then open the folder where you want to create a new folder.
	
5.	 Click the New Folder button.
	
	 A New Folder dialog appears, as shown in Figure 5-11.

6.	 Type a name for your folder in the dialog’s text box and then click Create.
	
	 A new folder is created in the location you specified.
	
	 This name cannot be identical to the name of any existing folder in that 
location.
	
7.	 In the main window of the Save As dialog, type a name for your docu­
ment in the Save As text box and then click Save.
	
	 Your new document is stored in your new folder.
Manipulating Files and Folders
After you create a file (by using a program like a word processor) or a folder 
(by using the Finder or a Save As dialog from a program), you might need to 
change or edit the name of that file or folder to correct a misspelling or to 
change the name altogether. Additionally, you might need to move or copy 
that file or folder to a new location, or delete it altogether.
	
To make sure you’re copying, moving, or changing the correct file, you might 
want to open it first. However, this can take time, and a faster way to view 
the contents of a file is to click that file in the Finder window and then click 
the Quick Look icon (or press the spacebar) to take a peek into the file’s con­
tents (refer to Figure 5-9).

Book I 
Chapter 5
Working with

107
Manipulating Files and Folders
Renaming a file or folder
The only limitation on naming a file or folder is that a name can’t be longer 
than 255 characters and the name can’t be identical to another file of the 
same type or a folder in that same location. For example, you can’t have two 
files or folders named Tax Info created by the same program stored in one 
folder (such as the Documents folder). However, you can have two identi­
cally named files stored in different folders.
	
You can’t use certain characters when naming files or folders, such as the 
colon (:). Additionally, some programs might not let you use the period (.) or 
slash (/) characters in a filename. 
You can store identically named files in the same location — as long as a dif­
ferent program created each file. That means you can have a word processor 
document named My Resume and a spreadsheet file also named My Resume 
stored in the same folder.
The reason for this is that a file’s complete name consists of two parts: a 
name and a file extension. The name is any arbitrary descriptive name you 
choose, but the file extension identifies the type of file. A program file actu­
ally consists of the .app file extension, a Microsoft Word file consists of the 
.doc file extension, a Pages file consists of the .pages file extension, and a 
Keynote file consists of the .key file extension.
Therefore, a My Resume file created by Microsoft Word is actually named 
My Resume.doc, and the identically named file created by Pages is actually 
named My Resume.pages. 
	
Not all files may have a file extension. It’s possible to save a file without a file 
extension, although this can make it difficult to determine what type of file it is.
To view a file’s extension, click that file and choose File➪Get Info (or press 
Ô+I). An Info window appears and displays the file extension in the Name & 
Extension text box. To view file extensions in the Finder, deselect the Hide 
Extension check box, as shown in Figure 5-12.
	
Folders don’t need file extensions, because file extensions identify the con­
tents of a file, and folders can hold a variety of different types of files.
For a fast way to rename a file or folder, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click a file or folder that you want to rename and then press Return.
	
	 The file or folder’s name appears highlighted.
	
2.	 Type a new name (or use the left- and right-arrow keys and the Delete 
key to edit the existing name) and then press Return.
	
	 Your selected file or folder appears with its new name.

When editing or typing a new name for a file, changing the file extension can 
confuse your Mac and prevent it from properly opening the file because it 
can no longer identify which program can open the file.
Copying a file or folder
At any time, you can copy a file or folder and place that duplicate copy in 
another location. When you copy a folder, you also copy any files and fold­
ers stored inside. To copy a file or folder, you can use either menus or the 
mouse.
Using menus to copy a file or folder
To copy a file or folder by using menus, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
	
	 The Finder appears.
	
2.	 Navigate to (and open) the folder that contains the files or folders you 
want to copy.
	
	 Use the Sidebar and the various other navigation techniques outlined 
earlier in this chapter to find what you want.

Manipulating Files and Folders
	
3.	 Select one or more files or folders you want to copy and then choose 
Edit➪Copy (or press Ô+C).
	
4.	 Navigate to (and open) the folder where you want to store a copy of 
the file or folder.
	
5.	 Choose Edit➪Paste (or press Ô+V).
	
	 You have your own cloned file or folder right where you want it.
Using the mouse to copy a file or folder
Using the menus to copy a file or folder is simple, but some people find click­
ing and dragging items with the mouse to be more intuitive. Clicking and 
dragging works slightly differently, depending on whether you’re dragging 
between two separate devices (such as from a flash drive to a hard drive) or 
between different folders on the same device.
If you want to use the click-and-drag method to copy a file or folder from one 
device to a second device, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
	
	 The Finder shows its face.
	
2.	 Navigate to (and open) the folder where you want to store your copied 
files or folders. 
	
3.	 Choose File➪New Finder Window. 
	
	 A second Finder window appears.
	
4.	 In the Sidebar of the new Finder window, click a device. 
	
	 This device must be different from the device you choose in Step 2.
	
5.	 In this second Finder window, navigate to (and open) the folder con­
taining the file or folder you want to copy. 
	
6.	 Using your mouse, click or drag to select one or more files or folders.
	
	 If you want to drag a file or folder to a new location on the same device, 
hold down the Option key while dragging the mouse.
	
7.	 Move the pointer over one of your selected items and then click and 
drag the selected items into the first Finder window and onto the 
folder that you opened in Step 3.
	
	 Notice that a green plus sign appears near the pointer while you drag 
the mouse. The green plus sign means you’re copying an item, as shown 
in Figure 5-13.
	
8.	 Release the mouse button.
	
	 Your selected files and folders appear as copies in the folder you 
selected.

to another.
	
	
Copying (or moving) a file or folder from one device (or folder) to another 
without having to open two windows, described in the steps below, is easy 
to accomplish thanks to your Mac’s spring-loaded folders feature. Drag and 
hold the file or folder you want to copy (or move) over the icon of the device 
or folder you want to copy to and wait a moment or two until the folder will 
spring open. (You can keep springing open folders this way until you reach 
the one you want.) Let go of the mouse button to copy (or move) the file 
or folder. To adjust how long it takes for folders to spring open, click the 
Finder, then choose Finder➪Preferences and click the General tab, then drag 
the slider at the bottom of the window to adjust how quickly (or slowly) 
folders spring open when you hover over them with a selected file or folder.
	
If you want to use the click-and-drag method to copy a file or folder from 
one folder to another folder on the same device, you need to use the Option 
key. If you don’t hold down the Option key in Step 4, you move your selected 
items rather than copy them. 
Moving a file or folder
Dragging a file or folder to a new location on the same device (such as from 
one folder to another on the same hard drive) always moves that file or 
folder (unless you hold down the Option key, which ensures that the original 
stays where it is and a copy is created in the new location). On the other 
hand, dragging a file or folder from one device to another (such as from a 
USB flash drive to a hard drive) always copies a file or folder — unless you 
use the Ô key, which puts a halt to the cloning business and moves the file 
or folder to a new location.

Archiving Files and Folders
Archiving Files and Folders
Files and folders take up space. If you have a bunch of files or folders that 
you don’t use, yet want or need to save (such as old tax information), you 
can archive those files. Archiving grabs a file or folder (or a bunch of files or 
folders) and compresses them into a single file that takes up less space on 
your hard disk than the original file or files.
After you archive a group of files, you can delete the original files. If necessary, 
you can later unarchive the archive file to retrieve all the files you packed into it.
You have two common ways to archive files and folders:
	
✦	 Creating ZIP files: ZIP files represent the standard archiving file format 
used on Windows computers. (By the way, ZIP isn’t an acronym. It just 
sounds speedy.)
	
✦	 Creating DMG files: DMG files (DMG stands for disc image) are meant 
for archiving files to be shared only with other Mac users. Generally, 
if you want to archive files that Windows and Mac users can use, store 
them in the ZIP file format. If you want to archive files just for other Mac 
users, you can use the ZIP or DMG file format.
	
The ZIP file format is faster and creates smaller archives than the DMG file 
format. However, the DMG file format offers more flexibility by allowing you 
to access individual files in the archive without having to unzip everything 
the way you must with a ZIP file. Most people use ZIP archives to store data. 
The most popular use for DMG files is for storing and distributing software.
Creating a ZIP file
A ZIP file can contain just a single file or folder, or dozens of separate files or 
folders. To create a ZIP file, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
	
	 The Finder comes to the fore.
	
2.	 Navigate to (and open) the folder that contains the file or folder you 
want to archive.
	
3.	 Select one or more items you want archive.
	
4.	 Choose File➪Compress.
	
	 If you select three items in Step 3, the Compress command displays 
Compress 3 items.
	
	 An archive file named Archive.zip appears in the folder that contains 
the items you selected to compress, as shown in Figure 5-14. (You can 
rename this file to give it a more descriptive name.)

112
Archiving Files and Folders
	
Figure 5-14: 
ZIP files 
appear with 
a zipper

To open a ZIP file, just double-click it. This creates a folder inside the same 
folder where the ZIP file is stored. Now you can double-click this newly cre­
ated folder to view the contents that were stored in the ZIP file.
Creating a DMG file
Although ZIP files are handy for storing files, DMG files more often are used 
to compress and store large items, such as the contents of an entire folder, 
CD, or hard drive. To create a DMG file, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock.
	
	 The Finder appears.
	
2.	 Move or copy the files you want to store in the DMG file into a single 
folder.
	
3.	 Choose Go➪Utilities and double-click the Disk Utility program icon.
	
	 The Disk Utility program loads and displays its window, as shown in 
Figure 5-15.
	
4.	 Choose File➪New➪Disc Image from Folder. 
	
	 The Select Folder to Image dialog appears.
	
5.	 Using the Select Folder to Image dialog, navigate to and then select 
the folder containing the files you chose in Step 2.
	
6.	 Click Image.
	
	 A New Image from Folder dialog appears, as shown in Figure 5-16.

• Read-Only: Saves files in the DMG file, but you can never add more 
files to this DMG file later.
 
• Compressed: Same as the Read-Only option, except squeezes the size 
of your DMG file to make it as small as possible.
 
• Read-Write: Saves files in a DMG file with the option of adding more 
files to this DMG file later.

• DVD/CD Master: Saves files for burning to an audio CD or a video DVD.
 
• Hybrid Image (HFS + ISO/UDF): Saves files in a DMG file designed 
to be burned to a CD/DVD for use in computers that can recognize 
Hierarchical File Structure (HFS), ISO 9660 (International Organization 
for Standardization), or Universal Disk Format (UDF) for storing data 
on optical media. (Most modern computers can recognize HFS and 
UDF discs, but older computers might not.) Also saves files in a DMG 
file designed for transfer over the Internet.
	
10.	 (Optional) Click the Encryption pop-up menu and choose None, 
128-bit AES, or 256-bit AES encryption. 
	
	 If you choose encryption, you have to define a password that can open 
the DMG file.
	
	 AES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard, which is the latest 
American government standard algorithm for scrambling data. Choose 
one of these options if you want to prevent prying eyes from viewing 
your disk image file’s contents (unless you share the password with 
those you trust).
	
11.	 Click Save.
	
	 Disk Utility displays a progress message while it compresses and stores 
the files in your chosen folder as a DMG file.
	
12.	 When the disk imaging is complete, choose Disk Utility➪Quit Disk 
Utility to exit the program.
	
Double-clicking a DMG file displays the contents of that DMG file in the 
Finder.
Searching Files
No matter how organized you try to be, there’s a good chance you might 
forget where you stored a file. To find your wayward files quickly, you can 
use the Spotlight feature.
Spotlight lets you type a word or phrase to identify the name of the file you 
want or a word or phrase stored inside that file. Then Spotlight displays a 
list of files that matches what you typed. Therefore, if you want to find all 
the files related to your baseball collection, you could type baseball and 
Spotlight would find all files that contain baseball in the filename or in the 
file itself if it’s one your Mac can peer into (such as a Word document, or an 
Excel spreadsheet.)

Searching Files
Using Spotlight
Spotlight searches for text that matches all or part of a filename and data 
stored inside of a file. When using Spotlight, search for distinct words. For 
example, searching for A will be relatively useless because so many files use 
A as part of their file name and in most files. However, searching for ebola 
will narrow your search to the files you most likely want.
To use Spotlight, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
	
	 The Finder promptly shows up.
	
2.	 Click in the Spotlight text box, as shown in Figure 5-17.
	
3.	 Type a word or phrase.
	
	 While you type, Spotlight displays the files that match your text.
At this point, you can double-click a file to open it, or you can copy and 
move it to a new location. 
	
You can change the way your search results appear by choosing View➪
As Icons, View➪as List, or View➪As Cover Flow.

Using Smart Folders
Spotlight can make finding files and folders fast and easy. However, if you 
find yourself constantly searching for the same types of files repeatedly, you 
can create a Smart Folder.
A Smart Folder essentially works behind the scenes with Spotlight to keep 
track of a bunch of files that share one or more common characteristics. For 
example, you can tell a Smart Folder to store info about only those files that 
contain top secret in the filename or the file; and from now on, you can look 
in that Smart Folder to access all files and folders that match top secret with­
out having to type the words in the Spotlight text box.
Think of Smart Folders as a way to organize your files automatically. Rather 
than take the time to physically move and organize the files, you can have 
Smart Folders do the work for you. 
	
A Smart Folder doesn’t physically contain any files or folders. Instead, it con­
tains only links to files or folders. This saves space by not duplicating files.
Creating a Smart Folder with Spotlight
To create a Smart Folder, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
	
	 The Finder appears.

2.	 Click in the Spotlight text box and type a word or phrase. 
	
	 Spotlight displays a list of files and folders that match your word or 
phrase.
	
3.	 Click the Save button that appears underneath the Spotlight text box. 
	
	 A Save As dialog appears, as shown in Figure 5-19.
	
Figure 5-19:

where to 
store it.
	
	
4.	 Click in the Save As text box and type a descriptive name for your 
Smart Folder.
	
5.	 Choose a location to store your Smart Folder from the Where pop-up 
menu (or click the down-arrow and navigate to the location where you 
want to save your Smart Folder).
	
6.	 (Optional) Select or Deselect the Add To Sidebar check box. 
	
	 Check the box if you want the Smart Folder to appear in the Sidebar in 
the Searches section near the bottom. Uncheck the box if you don’t want 
to see your Smart Folder in the Sidebar.
	
7.	 Click Save. 
	
	
	 Your Smart Folder appears in your chosen location. Instead of display­
ing an ordinary folder icon, Smart Folder icons always contain a gear 
inside a folder.
	
After you create a Smart Folder, it automatically keeps your list of files and 
folders up to date at all times. If you create new files or folders that match 
the text used to define a Smart Folder, that new file or folder name will 
appear in the Smart Folder automatically. Delete a file, and the Smart Folder 
deletes its link to that file as well. 
Creating a Smart Folder using other criteria
Besides organizing files and folders using Spotlight, Smart Folders can also 
list files and folders based on dates, sizes, color labels, and other criteria. To 
create a Smart Folder using these other criteria, follow these steps:

118
Searching Files
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock. 
	
	 The Finder appears.
	
2.	 Choose File➪New Smart Folder. 
	
	 A New Smart Folder window appears.
	
3.	 Click the plus sign icon that appears to the right of the Save button. 
	
	 The Kind and Any pop-up menus appear.
	
	 Clicking the plus sign icon adds something to the New Smart Folder 
window — in this case, a new pop-up menu and a couple of check boxes. 
In other words, it expands the window. After the window expands, the 
plus sign icon changes to a minus sign icon, which you use to contract 
the window to its original state.
	
4.	 Click the Kind pop-up menu and choose a criterion, such as Name or 
Last Opened date.
	
5.	 Click the Any pop-up menu and choose the type of files you want to 
find, such as Documents, Movies, or PDF, as shown in Figure 5-20.
	
Figure 5-20: 
Select the

	 A Save As dialog appears (refer to Figure 5-19).
	
7.	 Click in the Save As text box and type a descriptive name for your 
Smart Folder.
	
8.	 Choose a location to store your Smart Folder from the Where pop-up 
menu. 
	
9.	 (Optional) Select or Deselect the Add To Sidebar check box. 
	
	 Check the box if you want the Smart Folder to appear in the Sidebar in 
the Searches section near the bottom. Uncheck the box if you don’t want 
to see your Smart Folder in the Sidebar. 
	
10.	 Click Save. 
	
	 Your Smart Folder appears in your chosen location. Instead of display­
ing an ordinary folder icon, Smart Folder icons always contain a gear 
inside a folder.

Storing Files and Folders in the Dock
Using Smart Folders in the Sidebar
To make searching for files easier, the Finder has already created sev­
eral Smart Folders in the Sidebar. These Smart Folders are named Today, 
Yesterday, Past Week, All Images, All Movies, and All Documents, and they 
can be found under the Search For category, as shown in Figure 5-21.
	
Figure 5-21: 
The Finder 
window 
Sidebar 
contains 
several 
Smart 
Folders you 
can use 
right away.
	
By clicking one of these Smart Folders, you can view certain types of files, 
such as all files created today (in the Today Smart Folder) or all pictures 
stored on your hard drive (stored in the All Pictures Smart Folder).
Storing Files and Folders in the Dock
You can always find the files and folders you want by using the Finder. 
However, you might find that loading the Finder constantly just to access 
the contents of a particular folder can be tedious. As a faster alternative, you 
can store pointers to files and folders directly in the Dock.
Storing files in the Dock
If you have a file that you access regularly, consider placing an icon for that 
file directly in the Dock. That way, the file icon remains visible at all times 
(as long as the Dock is visible), and gives you one-click access to your 
frequently used files. 
To place a file icon in the Dock, follow these steps:

120
Storing Files and Folders in the Dock
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock and then navigate to the folder con­
taining the file you use frequently.
	
2.	 Click and drag the file to the Dock into any space to the left of the 
Trash icon and then release the mouse button. 
	
	 The icons in the Dock slide apart to make room for the icon. To open 
this file, just click its file icon.
	
A file icon in the Dock is just a link to your actual file. If you drag the file icon 
off the Dock, your physical file remains untouched.
Creating Stacks in the Dock
Rather than clutter the Dock with multiple file icons, consider storing a 
folder in the Dock. A folder icon, when stored in the Dock, is called a Stack. 
After you create a Stack in the Dock, you can view its contents by clicking 
the Stack.
To store a Stack in the Dock, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock to open a new Finder window and 
then navigate to a folder you use frequently.
	
2.	 Click and drag the folder to the Dock into any space to the right of the 
divider and then release the mouse button.
	
	 The Dock icons slide apart to make room for your Stack to give your 
folder a place all its own.
	
A Stack in the Dock is just a link to your actual folder and files. If you drag 
the Stack off the Dock, your folder and its file contents remain untouched.
Opening files stored in a Stack
After you place a Stack on the Dock, you can view its contents — and open a 
file in that Stack — by following these steps:
	
1.	 Click a Stack folder on the Dock.
	
	 If you have only a few files stored in a Stack, its contents fan out. If you 
have many files stored in a Stack, its contents appear in a grid.
	
2.	 Click the file you want to open in the fan, grid, or list.
	
	 Your chosen file opens.
	
Control-click on a Stack icon to display a shortcut menu of options you can 
choose to customize the way a Stack folder displays its contents when you 
click it.

Burning Files and Folders to CD/DVD
Burning Files and Folders to CD/DVD
A simple way to transfer or back up data is to store it on CDs or DVDs. (A CD 
can store 650–700 megabytes, whereas a DVD can store 4.7 or 8.5 gigabytes.) 
After you store data on a CD or DVD, you can easily transfer the data to 
another computer, including PCs running Windows or Linux.
	
Two types of CDs and DVDs exist: read-only and rewritable. Read-only discs 
are labeled CD-R or DVD-R, and you can copy data to them exactly once. 
Rewritable discs can store and erase data repeatedly. Rewritable discs cost 
more and they’re slower when it comes to burning and reading files to and 
from them, but they’re reusable so they’re more useful. The main advantage 
of read-only CDs is that some older audio CD players can only read read-only 
CDs, but not rewriteable CDs. Likewise, some older DVD players cannot read 
rewritable DVDs, but can read read-only DVDs. 
The process of copying data to a CD or DVD is burning a disc. To burn a disc, 
you must specify which files or folders you want to burn to the disc. 
Because copying or moving all files to a single folder can be cumbersome, 
you can create a special folder called a Burn Folder. A Burn Folder doesn’t 
store physical copies of your files or folders. Instead, a Burn Folder contains 
links to the files and folders you want to burn to a CD or DVD. That way, a 
Burn Folder won’t take double the amount of space needed to store your 
data.
Creating a Burn Folder
To create a Burn Folder, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock to open a new Finder window and 
then navigate to (and open) the folder where you want to store your 
Burn Folder.
	
2.	 Choose File➪New Burn Folder.
	
	
	 A Burn Folder appears bearing a circular yellow and black radiation logo.
	
3.	 Drag the files and folders you want to burn to a disc into the Burn 
Folder.
Burning the contents of a Burn Folder
After you drag links to your various files and folders into a Burn Folder, 
you can burn the contents onto as many discs as you want without having 
to specify each file and folder to burn each time. To burn the contents of a 
Burn Folder to a disc, follow these steps:

122
Deleting a File or Folder
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock to open a new Finder window, navi­
gate to (and open) the folder where you stored your Burn Folder, and 
then double-click it to open it.
	
	 Your Burn Folder opens.
	
2.	 Click the Burn button in the upper-right corner of the Burn Folder’s 
Finder window, or choose File➪Burn folder name to Disc, where 
folder name is the name of the folder you chose to burn.
	
	 A dialog appears, asking you to insert a blank disc.
	
3.	 Insert a blank CD or DVD into your Mac’s disc drive.
	
	 Sit back and wait for the burning process to complete. (An alert sound 
chimes at the end of a burning session.) If you try to burn more data than 
the CD or DVD can hold, your Mac won’t even try to burn your files. In this 
case, you have to remove some files from the Burn Folder and try again.
	
4.	 When the burning session is over, eject the finished disc by pressing 
the Eject button on the keyboard, or Control-click the disc icon on the 
Desktop and choose Eject from the shortcut menu.
	
Burn Folders are nice for burning files to a CD or DVD, but if you want more 
than just basic disc-burning capabilities, consider getting a standalone CD/
DVD burning program, such as Toast Titanium (www.roxio.com) or the 
aptly named, ultra-simple, freebie burning program, Burn (burn-osx.
sourceforge.net). Besides duplicating the basic disc-burning features of 
Burn Folders, Toast Titanium also provides a wealth of features for mixing 
and editing audio, compressing video, copying entire discs, and burning files 
on the Blu-ray disc format. 
Deleting a File or Folder
To delete a file or folder, you first have to place that item in the Trash. But 
putting an item in the Trash doesn’t immediately delete it. In fact, you can 
retrieve any number of files or folders you’ve “thrown away.” Nothing is 
really gone — permanently deleted — until you empty the Trash.
	
Deleting a folder deletes any files or folders stored inside. Therefore, if you 
delete a single folder, you might really be deleting 200 other folders contain­
ing files you might not have meant to get rid of, so always check the contents 
of a folder before you delete it, just to make sure it doesn’t contain anything 
important.
To delete a file or folder, follow these steps:

Deleting a File or Folder
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock to open a new Finder window and 
then navigate to (and open) the folder that contains the file or folder 
you want to delete. 
	
2.	 Select the file or folder (or files and folders) that you want to delete.
	
3.	 Choose one of the following:
 
• Choose File➪Move to Trash.
 
• Drag the selected items onto the Trash icon in the Dock.
 
• Press Ô+Delete.
 
• Control-click a selected item and choose Move to Trash from the 
shortcut menu that appears.
Retrieving a file or folder from the Trash
When you move items to the Trash, you can retrieve them again as long as 
you haven’t emptied the Trash since you threw them out. If the Trash icon 
in the Dock appears filled with a pile of crumbled up paper, you can still 
retrieve files or folders from the Trash. If the Trash icon appears empty, 
there are no files or folders there you can retrieve.
To retrieve a file or folder from the Trash, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Trash icon in the Dock.
	
	 A Finder window appears, showing all the files and folders you deleted 
since the last time you emptied the Trash.
	
2.	 Select the item (or items) you want to retrieve, drag them onto a 
device or folder where you want to store your retrieved items, and 
then release the mouse button.
Emptying the Trash
Every deleted file or folder gets stored in the Trash, where it eats up space 
on your hard drive until you empty the Trash. When you’re sure that you 
won’t need items you trashed any more, you can empty the Trash to perma­
nently delete the files and free up additional space on your hard drive.
To empty the Trash, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Finder icon in the Dock (or click the Desktop) and then 
choose File➪Empty Trash. 
	
	 A dialog appears, asking whether you’re sure that you want to remove 
the items in the Trash permanently.
	
2.	 Click OK (or Cancel).

124
Deleting a File or Folder
	
If you open the Finder and choose Finder➪Secure Empty Trash, your Mac 
will write over the deleted files with random data to foil any attempt to 
recover deleted files later with a special file recovery program. If you want to 
delete something sensitive that you don’t want to risk falling into the wrong 
hands, choose Finder➪Secure Empty Trash.
	
For a faster way of emptying the Trash, Control-click the Trash icon in the 
Dock and choose Empty Trash from the shortcut menu that appears, or click 
the Finder icon (or the Desktop) and press Ô+Shift+Delete.

E
very Mac works the same, but that doesn’t mean they all have to look 
and feel the same. To personalize your Mac, you can change the way it 
looks and even how it behaves.
If you have trouble with your vision, hearing, or movement, even using a 
computer as friendly as your Mac can be difficult. Thankfully, every Mac 
comes with special universal access features that you can turn on and 
modify.
By customizing your Mac — and adjusting to how it works to make things 
easier on your eyes, ears, or hands — you can stamp it with your person­
ality and truly turn your Mac into a personal computer that feels like it is 
working with you and for you, rather than against you.
Changing the Desktop
The Desktop fills the screen in the absence of any program windows. 
Generally, the Desktop displays a decorative background image, but you 
can display any image, such as a picture captured with a digital camera or a 
favorite picture you downloaded from the Internet.

126
Changing the Desktop
Choosing a built-in Desktop image
Your Mac comes with a variety of images stored and organized into different 
categories. To choose one of these images as your Desktop image, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Control-click anywhere on the Desktop and choose Change Desktop 
Background from the shortcut menu that appears.
	
	 The Desktop preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 6-1.
	
2.	 Click a category, such as Nature or Plants.
	
Figure 6-1:

preferences 
let you 
choose a 
different 
background 
image.
	
	
3.	 Click the image that you want to adorn your Desktop and then click 
the Close button to close the preferences pane.
The Desktop preferences pane offers other options, which you can see near 
the bottom of Figure 6-1:
	
✦	 Change Picture: Click the pop-up menu to tell your Mac to change the 
Desktop background picture to another one in the selected category 
based on a time interval, when you log in to your Mac, or when you wake 
it from Sleep mode.
	
✦	 Random: Randomly changes the Desktop background image.
	
✦	 Translucent Menu Bar: Gives your Mac’s menu bar a translucent “see 
through” effect.

Changing the Desktop
Choosing an iPhoto image for the Desktop
If you capture images with a digital camera and store those images in iPhoto, 
you can choose one of your iPhoto images to appear on your Desktop by fol­
lowing these steps:
	
1.	 Control-click anywhere on the Desktop and choose Change Desktop 
Background from the shortcut menu.
	
	 The Desktop preferences pane appears (refer to Figure 6-1).
	
2.	 Click the disclosure triangle that appears to the left iPhoto in the left 
column, click an iPhoto category, such as Photos, and then click the 
image you want to display as your new Desktop background.
	
	 Your chosen iPhoto image appears on the Desktop as the background 
image, and a new pop-up menu appears above your iPhoto images.
	
3.	 Click the pop-up menu above your iPhoto images to choose:
 
• Fill Screen: Expands the image to fill the screen but might cut off 
edges, depending on the dimensions of the original image.
 
• Fit to Screen: Expands the image to fill most of the screen, but might 
leave edges uncovered depending on the dimensions of the original 
image; click the menu to the right of this option to choose the color 
of the border that may surround the image.
 
• Stretch to Fill Screen: Stretches a picture to fill the entire screen, which 
might distort the image similar to the way a carnival mirror can.
 
•	 Center: Places the image in the middle of the screen at its original 
size, and might leave edges uncovered depending on the image’s 
dimensions; click the menu to the right of this option to choose the 
color of the border that may surround the image.
 
•	 Tile: Duplicates the image in rows and columns to fill the screen.
	
4.	 Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
Choosing your own image for the Desktop
You might have images stored on your hard drive that you have not 
imported into iPhoto. To display non-iPhoto images on the Desktop back­
ground, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Control-click anywhere on the Desktop and choose Change Desktop 
Background from the shortcut menu to open the Desktop preferences 
pane (refer to Figure 6-1).
	
2.	 Click the triangle symbol that appears to the left of Folders in the left 
column.

128
Customizing the Screen Saver
	
	 You have two options:
 
• Click the Pictures folder to display any pictures you’ve stored in 
your Pictures folder. Any images stored in separate folders inside the 
Pictures folder will not be visible.
	
•	 Click the Add (+) button in the lower-left corner and use the dialog 
that appears to navigate to the folder that contains the image you 
want to use.
	
3.	 Click the image that you want to use for the Desktop background and 
then click the Close button to close the preferences pane.
Customizing the Screen Saver
A screen saver is an animated image that appears on the screen after a fixed 
period when your Mac doesn’t detect any keyboard or mouse activity. When 
selecting a screen saver, you can choose an image to display and the amount 
of time to wait before the screen saver starts.
	
Screen savers were important in the old days when most monitors used 
cathode-ray tubes (CRTs). If a CRT monitor displayed the same static image 
for long periods, such images eventually burned in, or became physically 
etched into the glass. (Look at the screens of old arcade video games to see 
these “ghost” images.) If you have a liquid-crystal display (LCD) monitor — 
standard for modern computers — this won’t happen, so screen savers are 
mostly for decorative purposes today.
	
For an eco-friendlier alternative to using the screen saver, check out the 
Energy Saver setting described in the “Saving Energy” section of this chapter.
To choose a screen saver, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences from the Finder menu and then click 
the Desktop & Screen Saver icon.
	
	 The Desktop & Screen Saver preferences pane appears.
	
2.	 Click the Screen Saver tab to display the Screen Saver preferences 
pane, as shown in Figure 6-2, and then click one of the screen savers 
listed in the Apple or Pictures category in the left column.
	
	 The preview pane shows you what your screen saver will look like. (If 
you select the Use Random Screen Saver check box, your Mac will pick 
a different screen saver image every time the screen saver starts. After 
your randomly chosen screen saver starts, that same animated image 
appears until you press a key to turn off the screen saver.)
	
	 Under the Pictures category, you can choose the Pictures folder, an 
iPhoto album, or the Choose Folder option, which lets you pick any 
folder on your hard drive to locate an image to use.

Uneasy Silence (http://uneasysilence.com/toast).
Changing the Display and Appearance
Because you’ll be staring at your Mac’s screen every time you use it, you 
might want to modify the way the screen displays information. Some 
changes you can make include changing the Desktop size (resolution), or 
selecting another color scheme of your various menus, windows, and dia­
logs. The next sections show you how.
Changing the screen resolution
The display defines the screen resolution, measured in pixels — the dots 
that make up an image. The higher the display resolution, the more pixels 
you have and the sharper the image — but everything on your screen might 
appear smaller.

Changing the Display and Appearance
	
Selecting your Mac display’s highest resolution generally puts your Mac’s 
best face forward, so to speak, when it comes to making everything look 
sharp and correct on your screen.
To change the screen resolution, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Displays icon to 
open the Display preferences pane, as shown in Figure 6-4.
	
Figure 6-4: 
Display 
preferences 
let you 
choose a 
different 
screen 
resolution.
	
	
2.	 Click the Display tab (if it isn’t already chosen), and then choose a 
screen resolution from the Resolutions list.
	
	 Your Mac immediately changes the resolution so you can see how it 
looks. If you don’t like the resolution, try again until you find one that’s 
easy on your eyes.
	
3.	 (Optional) Click the Color tab, click the Calibrate button, and then 
follow the steps that display to tweak the way your Mac displays 
colors; click the Done button when you reach the final step to return 
to the Display preferences pane.
	
4.	 Click the Close button in the System Preferences window when you’re 
happy with the screen resolution.
Changing the color of the user interface
Another way to change the appearance of the screen is to modify the colors 
used in windows, menus, and dialogs. To change the color of these user 
interface items, follow these steps:

132
Changing the Date and Time
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and click the Appearance icon to open 
the Appearance preferences pane, as shown in Figure 6-5.
	
Figure 6-5: 
Appearance 
preferences 
let you

colors.
	
	
2.	 Use the Appearance and Highlight Color pop-up menus to choose your 
color variations.
	
	 The Appearance pop-up menu defines the colors that normally show 
up on windows, buttons, and so on, whereas the Highlight Color pop-up 
menu defines the color of items that you select.
	
3.	 Click the Close button to close the Appearance preferences pane.
Changing the Date and Time
Keeping track of time might seem trivial, but knowing the right time is 
important so your Mac can determine when you created or modified a par­
ticular file and keep track of appointments you’ve made through programs, 
such as iCal.
Of course, keeping track of time is useless if you don’t set the right time to 
begin with. To set the proper date and time, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Date & Time icon to 
open the Date & Time preferences pane, as shown in Figure 6-6.
	
2.	 Select (or deselect) the Set Date & Time Automatically check box. If 
you select this check box, click the drop-down list to choose a location.
	
	 This feature works only if you’re connected to the Internet. If you aren’t 
connected to the Internet, click the calendar to pick a date and click the 
clock to pick a time.

6.	 Click the Close button to close the Date & Time preferences pane.
Adjusting Sounds
Every Mac can play sound through speakers (built-in or external) or head­
phones, from making the simplest beeping noise to playing audio CDs like 
a stereo. Three primary ways to modify the sound on your Mac involve 
volume, balance, and input/output devices. 
Volume simply means how loud your Mac plays sound by default. Many 
programs, such as iTunes, also let you adjust the volume, so you can set the 
default system volume and then adjust the volume within each program, 
relative to the system volume, as well.
Balance defines how sound plays through the right and left stereo speak­
ers. By adjusting the balance, you can make sound louder coming from one 
speaker and weaker coming from the other.
Depending on your equipment, it’s possible to have multiple input and 
output devices — speakers and headphones as two distinct output devices, 
for example. By defining which input and output device to use, you can 
define which one to use all the time.

✦	 Computer Sleep: Moving this slider to the left is the greener way to go. 
Moving to the right is less efficient because it allows a smart device to 
do nothing other than burn energy for no good reason.
	
✦	 Display Sleep: Maybe you take a break and then return to your com­
puter at regular intervals but you don’t want to wake your Mac from 
lots of catnaps several times a day. Fair enough. Set the Computer Sleep 
slider (see the preceding bullet) a little farther to the right and then drag 

138

the Display Sleep slider to the left to snap your Mac to attention in a 
flash, with only the slightest pause before the screen comes back to life.
	
✦	 Put the Hard Disks(s) to Sleep When Possible: Select this option to 
“snooze” the hard disk whenever it determines that the programs you’re 
running don’t need to keep the drive (or drives) spinning. If you regu­
larly perform hard disk intensive tasks, such as edit videos or play 3D 
games, deselect this option.
	
✦	 Wake for Ethernet Network Administration Access: Choose this option 
if you want other users in your house or workplace to be able to access 
your Mac’s shared resources, such as shared printers or iTunes music 
playlists, even when your computer is in Sleep mode.
	
✦	 Automatically Reduce the Brightness of the Display Before Display 
Sleep: When you select this option, the brightness level on the display 
drops a few notches before blanking out the screen after the length of 
time you select in the Display Sleep setting (see previous bullet).
	
✦	 Start Up Automatically After a Power Failure: Whether by brownouts, black­
outs, or black cats knocking out power cords, power failures happen. Use this 
option to specify how your Mac should react when the lights come on after 
a power failure. Select the check box if you want your Mac to restart, and 
deselect it if you prefer to turn it back on when the power is running again.
	
✦	 Show Battery Status in the Menu Bar: Selecting this option on your 
MacBook lets you keep visual tabs on how much battery juice remains 
when your machine is unplugged from the wall outlet — and how long 
you need to wait until its battery is fully charged after you plug into 
a power outlet. To change the information you see, click the Battery 
Status icon, click Show, and then choose Icon Only, Time, or Percentage 
to see your battery’s status the way you like it.
	
✦	 Schedule: Click the Schedule button to open these scheduling options:
 
• Start Up or Wake: Choose when you want your Mac to greet you on 
weekdays or weekends, every day, or one day in particular.
	
	 Click the up and down arrows to adjust the time, as shown in Figure

Choosing a Printer
Choosing a Printer
Out of the box, your Mac comes with a number of special files called printer 
drivers, which tell your Mac how to communicate with a number of popular 
brands of printer models. When you buy a new printer, it often comes with 
a CD that contains a printer driver that you can install to unlock special fea­
tures that the Mac’s built-in drivers might not take advantage of.
	
Check the support section of the printer manufacturer’s Web site to see 
whether a newer version of the printer installation software has become 
available. After you run the installer, you can check the Web site every 
now and then to see whether an even newer version (than the one you’ve 
installed) is available.
Making your Mac work with your printer involves a two-step process. First, 
you must physically connect your printer to your Mac, usually with a USB 
cable or network connection.
	
More and more new printer models come with built-in wireless connection 
options such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, which means no more tangled cables 
between your Mac and your printer.
Second, you must install the proper printer driver on your Mac (if you don’t 
want to use the built-in driver that comes with your Mac, or if your Mac 
doesn’t have a driver for it). After you connect your printer to your Mac and 
install or select the correct printer driver, you can then print documents and 
control your printer’s options.
	
You can download printer drivers (and drivers for other types of hardware, 
such as scanners and pressure-sensitive tablets) directly from Apple’s Web 
site (www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/drivers) or from the printer 
manufacturer’s Web site.
After you physically connect a printer to your Mac and install its printer 
driver, you might need to take one additional step and tell your Mac that this 
particular printer is connected. To get your Mac to recognize a connected 
printer, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Print & Fax icon to 
open the Print & Fax preferences pane.
	
2.	 Click the Add (+) button, as shown in Figure 6-14.
	
	 Note: Your Mac might list local printers (printers directly attached to 
your Mac) as well as printers linked to your Mac via a network.
	
3.	 Click a printer name in the Printers list and then click the Default 
Printer pop-up menu to choose the new printer (or another) your 
Mac’s programs will always print to (unless you specify otherwise).
	
4.	 Click the Close button to close the Print & Fax preferences pane.

If you replace your printer with another one, your Mac might still try to use 
the printer you’re no longer using anyway. To prevent this, click the printer 
as described above but click the minus sign to delete the printer.
Creating Separate Accounts
Rather than buy separate Mac computers for everyone in your household, 
you can do the next best thing by creating a separate user account for each 
person using the Mac. Accounts essentially give a Mac multiple personalities 
to suit each person using the Mac. If you create three accounts on your Mac, 
each account can have its own personality based on each user’s preference, 
such as their favorite screen saver and desktop background image, preferred 
system sound and energy savings settings, and a separate Home folder for 
saving and organizing files and folders without affecting any other accounts. 
By using accounts, each person can engage with the Mac as though they’re 
the only person using it.
Types of accounts
When you turn on your Mac for the very first time, a set of automatic setup 
steps run to create a user account consisting of a username and password. 
Multiple people can share this single account, but doing so increases the 
risk of someone deleting an important file that belongs to somebody else. 

Book I 
Chapter 6
Customizing  
Your Mac and 
Adjusting Settings
141
Creating Separate Accounts
Sharing the same account also means everyone can see everyone else’s 
files and folders. In other words, nothing saved on the Mac’s hard drive is 
private. As such, it’s a better bet to set up multiple accounts on the Mac for 
multiple users.
You can create four types of accounts:
	
✦	 Administrator: Gives the user access to create, modify, and delete 
accounts. You should limit the number of Administrator accounts you 
have to perhaps one or two (one for each parent in a household). Note 
that when you turn on your Mac for the first time, the type of account 
that is created is an Administrator account.
	
✦	 Standard: Gives the user access to their individual account’s files and 
folders, but doesn’t let the user create, modify, or delete any additional 
accounts.
	
✦	 Managed with Parental Controls: Gives the user restricted access to the 
computer based on the parental controls defined by an Administrator 
account.
	
✦	 Guest: Gives the user access but doesn’t let the user modify the Mac’s 
settings or save any files to the hard disk.
	
This section looks at how to create accounts in general, but Book IV, Chapter 4 
specifically explains how to create and manage Guest and Managed with 
Parental Controls accounts.
	
The number one reason to have only one Administrator account is to pro­
tect yourself. If you create two or more Administrator accounts, anyone 
using those other Administrator accounts has full power to erase your 
Administrator account along with all your important files. If you have the 
only Administrator account, no one else can delete your account or files.
Creating an account
Before you create an account, you need to decide the type of account to 
create and come up with the account’s username and password. To create 
an account, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Accounts icon to 
open the Accounts preferences pane, as shown in Figure 6-15.
	
2.	 Click the Lock in the bottom-left corner to gain the ability to create 
accounts, type your password into the dialog that appears, and then 
click OK.

ated after you pressed Tab in the previous step.
	
7.	 Click the Password text box, type a password for this account, click 
the Verify field, and then retype the password to confirm your choice.
	
8.	 (Optional) Click the Password Hint text box and type a descriptive 
phrase you think will help the new user remember the password if it’s 
forgotten.
	
9.	 (Optional) Select the Turn On FileVault Protection check box to have 
your Mac protect the user’s personal files and folders by encrypting 
the user’s Home folder and all of the files and folders the user stores 
inside it.
	
	 To learn more about how you can use FileVault to secure your Mac 
against prying eyes and other security threats, check out Book II, 
Chapter 2. 
	
10.	 Click the Create Account button. 
	
	 You return to the Accounts preferences pane, which now displays the 
name of your new account. A dialog appears, asking whether you want 
to turn Automatic Login on or off. With multiple accounts, your Mac 
doesn’t know which account to log in to unless you specify an account.)
	
11.	 Choose how to log in.
	
	 Click Keep Automatic Login if you want to log in automatically to your 
Administrator account at startup. Alternatively, you can choose a dif­
ferent account to log in to from the Automatic Login pop-up menu. Click 
Turn Off Automatic Login if you want to choose which account to use 
each time you turn on your Mac.
	
12.	 Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
Switching between accounts
The Mac offers several ways to switch between accounts. The most straight­
forward way is to log out of one account and then log in to a different 
account. A faster and more convenient way is to use Fast User Switching, 
which essentially lets you switch accounts without having to log out of one 
account first. 
To log out of an account, simply choose Ú➪Log Out (or press Ô+Shift+Q). 
After you log out, the login window appears, listing the names and user icons 
of all accounts. At this time, you can click a different account name to log in 
to that account.

144
Creating Separate Accounts
Before you can log out, you must close any files and shut down any running 
programs. If you use Fast User Switching, you won’t have to bother with 
any of that, because Fast User Switching gives the illusion of putting the 
currently active account in “suspended animation” mode while your Mac 
opens another account.
Enabling Fast User Switching
Before you can use Fast User Switching, you have to turn on this feature. Log 
in as Administrator and then follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and click the Accounts icon to open 
the Accounts preferences pane (refer to Figure 6-15).
	
2.	 Click the Lock icon (if it is locked) in the lower-left corner of the 
Accounts window to allow you to edit your accounts, type your pass­
word into the dialog that appears, and then click OK.
	
3.	 Click the Login Options icon near the bottom-left corner of the 
Accounts window to display the Login Options pane, as shown in 
Figure 6-17.

4.	 Select the Show Fast User Switching Menu As check box, click the 
pop-up menu, and then choose how you want to display the Fast User 
Switching Menu: Name, Short Name, or Icon.
	
	 These options display what appears on the menulet. Name displays full 
account names, Short Name displays abbreviated account names, and

5.	 Click the Close button to close the Accounts preferences pane.
Changing accounts with Fast User Switching
When you enable Fast User Switching, the Fast User Switching menulet 
appears in the right side of the menu bar, as shown in Figure 6-18. The menu­
let displays the names of accounts you can choose.

bar and then click the account name you want to use.
	
2.	 Type the account password in the dialog that appears and then press 
Return. 
	
	 Your Mac switches you to your chosen account.
Deleting an account
After you create one or more accounts, you might want to delete them. 
When you delete an account, your Mac gives you the option of retaining the 
account’s Home folder, which might contain important files. To delete an 
account, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Make sure the account you want to delete is logged out and you are 
logged in to your Administrator account.
	
2.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Accounts icon to 
open the Accounts preferences pane (refer to Figure 6-15).
	
3.	 Click the Lock icon in the bottom-left corner of the Accounts prefer­
ences pane to allow you to edit your accounts, type your password 
into the dialog that appears, and then click OK.

4.	 Select the account you want to delete in the accounts list and then 
click the Delete Account (-) button in the lower-left corner of the 
Accounts preferences pane.
	
	 A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to delete this account 
and presents options to save the Home folder of the account, as shown 
in Figure 6-19.
 
• Save the Home Folder in a Disk Image: Saves the home folder and its 
contents in a compressed disk image (DMG) file. This keeps the files 
compressed, so they take up less space on the hard drive than if you 
choose the next option (which does not compress the files contained 
in the Home folder). Choosing this option is like stuffing stuff in an 
attic to get it out of sight, but still keeping it around in case you need 
it later.
 
• Do Not Change the Home Folder: Keeps the Home folder and its con­
tents exactly as they are before you delete the account, so you can 
browse through the files contained within the folder at any time.
 
• Delete the Home Folder: Wipes out any files the user might have cre­
ated in the account.

Using Your Mac’s Accessibility Features
Right out of the box, every Mac behaves exactly the same. This can be a 
good thing because it means you can use any Mac anywhere and expect it to 
work the same — whether the Mac is in New Jersey or Norway. 
Unfortunately, not everyone has perfect eyesight, hearing, or eye-hand coor­
dination. If you have trouble with your vision, hearing, or ability to use the 
keyboard or mouse (or both), using a computer can be difficult. That’s why 
every Mac comes with special universal access features that you can turn 

Book I 
Chapter 6
Customizing  
Your Mac and 
Adjusting Settings
147
Using Your Mac’s Accessibility Features
on and modify. These universal access features fall under four categories — 
seeing, hearing, keyboard, and mouse and trackpad — all of which I discuss 
in some detail on the following pages.
Mitigating vision limitations
To help the visually impaired, every Mac includes a VoiceOver feature, 
which essentially lets your Mac read text, e-mail, and even descriptions of 
the screen in a computer-generated voice. For partially sighted users, the 
Mac can magnify images on the screen or change the contrast of the screen 
to make it easier to read. To modify the vision assistance features of your 
Mac, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Universal Access 
icon to open the Universal Access preferences pane, as shown in 
Figure 6-20.
	
Figure 6-20:

options for 
making the 
Mac easier 
to use for 
the visually 
impaired.
	
	
2.	 Click the Seeing tab and then select the options you want to activate, 
which include:
 
• VoiceOver: Allows your Mac to describe what’s on the screen and 
assist you in using the Macintosh menus. Click the Open VoiceOver 
Utility button to customize such options as how fast your Mac speaks 
and whether it speaks with a male or female synthesized voice.
 
• Zoom: Allows you to magnify the screen around the cursor by 
pressing Option+Ô+= (equal sign) or return to normal by pressing 
Option+Ô+– (minus sign).

• Display: Choose either the Black on White (the default option) or 
White on Black (which gives a photographic negative effect) radio 
button. 
	
	 Check the Use Grayscale option if you want to make your Mac’s screen 
have the look and feel of a black and white photograph. Drag the 
Enhance Contrast slider to increase/decrease the screen contrast.
 
•	 Enable Access for Assistive Devices: Check this option to allow exter­
nal devices (such as unique keyboards or mice) to use AppleScript 
to control the Mac user interface.
 
• Show Universal Access Status in the Menu Bar: If selected, this option 
displays a Universal Access menulet on the menu bar, allowing you 
to turn Universal Access features on or off.
	
3.	 Click the Close button or press Ô+Q to close the Universal Access 
Preferences pane.
Compensating for hearing limitations
To adjust for hearing impairments, you can increase the volume for your 
various system alerts or you can have your Mac flash the screen to catch 
your attention. To have the Mac flash the screen rather than make a beeping 
noise, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Universal Access icon 
to open the Universal Access preferences pane (refer to Figure 6-20).
	
2.	 Click the Hearing tab to display the Hearing preferences pane, as 
shown in Figure 6-21.

Preferences dialog, where you can adjust the system volume to suit 
your hearing needs.
	
6.	 Click the Close button or press Ô+Q to close the Universal Access 
Preferences pane.
Easing keyboard limitations
If you have physical limitations using the keyboard, the Mac offers two 
solutions: the Sticky Keys feature and the Slow Keys feature. Sticky Keys 
can help you use keystroke shortcuts, such as Ô+P (Print), which usually 
require pressing two or more keys at the same time. By turning on Sticky 
Keys, you can use keystroke shortcuts by pressing one key at a time. The 
first key you press, such as the Ô key, “sticks” in place and waits until you 
press a second key to complete the keystroke shortcut. 
The Slow Keys feature slows the reaction time of the Mac every time you 
press a key. Normally when you press a key, the Mac accepts it right away, 
but Slow Keys can force a Mac to wait a long time before accepting the typed 
key. That way, your Mac will ignore any accidental taps on the keyboard and 
patiently wait until you hold down a key for a designated period before it 
accepts it as valid.
To turn on Sticky Keys or Slow Keys, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Universal Access icon 
to open the Universal Access preferences pane (refer to Figure 6-20).
	
2.	 Click the Keyboard tab to display the Keyboard preferences pane, as 
shown in Figure 6-22.
	
3.	 Click the On radio button to turn on Sticky Keys and then click any 
additional options you want to activate, including:
 
• Press the Shift key Five Times to Turn Sticky Keys On or Off: Lets you 
turn the Sticky Keys feature on or off with the keyboard.
 
• Beep When a Modifier Key Is Set: Alerts you when you’ve pressed a 
so-called “modifier” key — a key such as Option or Ô — which is 
used in combination with another key to modify how that key works.
 
• Display Pressed Keys On Screen: When activated, any modifier keys 
you press (such as the Ô or Option key) display onscreen in the 
upper-right corner of the screen, so you can verify that you’ve 
pressed the right key.

sound every time you press a key to give you audible feedback.
 
• Acceptance Delay: Dragging this slider to the left lengthens the time 
it takes your Mac to recognize when you press and hold down a key; 
dragging the slider to the right shortens the time your Mac waits to 
recognize when you press and hold down a key.
 
• Set Key Repeat: Click this button to turn on, turn off, and adjust how 
slowly (or quickly) your Mac repeats a key when you hold it down.

Dealing with mouse limitations
If you have physical limitations using the mouse, you can turn on the Mouse 
& Trackpad feature, which lets you control the mouse through the numeric 
keys, as shown in Table 6-1.

The Mouse Keys feature is really designed for keyboards that have a sepa­
rate numeric keypad. If you’re using a laptop or other keyboard that doesn’t 
have a separate numeric keypad, the numeric keys might be embedded in 
the regular typewriter keys. To control the mouse, you have to turn on the 
Number Lock key to use the numeric keys to move the mouse. Then you 
have to press the Number Lock key again to use the keys for typing ordinary 
letters.
	
Unfortunately, new MacBook and desktop Mac compact keyboards (without 
dedicated numeric keypads) do not have Number Lock keys and corre­
sponding numeric key overlays on their keyboards. If your Mac or MacBook 
keyboard doesn’t have a Number Lock key, you might want to consider 
buying an optional external numeric keypad, such as the one sold by 
Logitech (www.logitech.com) shown in Figure 6-23.

152
Using Your Mac’s Accessibility Features
With an external numeric keypad, you can easily control your Mac’s pointer 
using the Mouse Keys feature. The Mouse Keys feature can replace the 
mouse altogether or just provide you with another way to move the mouse. 
No matter how you plan to move the mouse, you might still have trouble 
finding it on the screen. Fortunately, you can enlarge the size of the pointer 
to make it easy to spot and use.
To turn on the Mouse Keys feature or change the size of the pointer, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Universal Access icon 
to open the Universal Access preferences pane (refer to Figure 6-20).
	
2.	 Click the Mouse (or Mouse & Trackpad, on MacBooks) tab and then 
click the On radio button to turn on the Mouse Keys feature, as shown 
in Figure 6-24.

including:
 
• Press the Option Key Five Times to Turn Mouse Keys On or Off: Lets 
you turn the Mouse Keys feature on or off from the keyboard.
 
• Initial Delay: Drag the slider to define how long the Mac waits before 
moving the pointer with the numeric key. A short value means the 
Mac might immediately move the pointer as soon as you press a 
number key. A long value means you must hold down a numeric key 
for a longer period before it starts moving the pointer.

Using Voice Recognition and Speech
Your Mac offers both voice recognition and speech capabilities. The voice 
recognition feature lets you control your Mac using spoken commands, and 
the speech capability lets your Mac read text or beep to alert you when 
something happens, such as a dialog popping up on the screen. 
	
Even if you don’t have an impairment, your Mac’s voice recognition and 
speech capabilities can be useful for controlling your Mac, or listening to 
text you’ve written to catch typos or other errors you might miss by only 
reading what you’ve written rather than hearing it aloud.
Setting up voice recognition
To use the Mac’s built-in voice recognition software, you have to define its 
settings and then assign specific types of commands to your voice. Defining 
the voice recognition settings means choosing how to turn on voice recogni­
tion and how your Mac will acknowledge it received your voice commands 
correctly. For example, your Mac may wait until you press the Esc key or 
speak a certain word before it starts listening to voice commands. When it 
understands your command, it can beep.
To define the voice recognition settings, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Speech icon to open 
the Speech preferences pane.
	
2.	 Click the Speech Recognition tab, as shown in Figure 6-25, and then 
click the On radio button to turn on the Speakable Items feature.
	
3.	 Choose an appropriate device for accepting your spoken commands 
from the Microphone pop-up menu.
	
	 Internal Microphone would be an obvious choice here unless you 
happen to have an external microphone connected to your Mac.

conversations as commands.
 
• Required before Each Command: You must speak the keyword before 
your Mac will accept spoken commands.
 
• Required 15 Seconds after Last Command: You must repeat the key­

M
any programs have so many features crammed into them that suc­
ceeding versions get more bloated and harder to use. If you only 
want to perform a simple task, such as adding a few numbers together or 
printing an envelope, you probably don’t need to load a full-blown spread­
sheet or word processing program. Instead, you’re better off using a much 
simpler program specifically designed to solve a single task.
That’s the idea behind Dashboard. Dashboard provides you with quick access 
to a collection of small, simple-task programs called widgets. Some typical 
widgets display a calendar, weather forecasts for your city, a calculator, stock 
market quotes, and movie times for your neighborhood movie theaters.
Widgets are designed to simplify your life, and Dashboard is the program that 
helps you display, manage, and hide widgets. By using Dashboard, you can be 
more productive without having to learn an entirely new program to do so.
Getting to Know Your Dashboard Widgets
To view your widgets, open Dashboard by pressing the Dashboard key on 
your new or recent Mac or MacBook’s keyboard — it’s the fifth key from the 
left in the upper row, sharing space with the F4 function key. You can also 
press Fn+F12 on your new, recent, and older Macs alike, including models 
that don’t have dedicated special function keys for Dashboard, Exposé, and 
other nifty, one-touch Mac controls and features. If you prefer the mouse, you 
can click the Dashboard icon on the Dock. When you finish using a widget, 
you close it (and the Dashboard) the same way: by pressing the Dashboard 
key or Fn+F12, or by clicking the mouse pointer on your Mac’s Desktop.

164
Getting to Know Your Dashboard Widgets
	
While most MacBook keyboards have a Function (Fn) key, other Mac key­
boards don’t always have the Fn key. If your Mac’s keyboard doesn’t have 
a Fn key, you can just press whatever function key I tell you to press and 
ignore my mention of Fn key whenever you encounter it.
As soon as you open Dashboard, several widgets pop into view, as shown in 
Figure 1-1. The default widgets that appear are the calendar, clock, calcula­
tor, and weather widgets.
The calendar widget lets you view dates for different months and years. The 
clock widget displays the time in a big clock, which can be easier to read 
than the tiny time display in the right end of the menu bar. The calculator 
widget acts like a typical four-function calculator, and the weather widget 
offers forecasts for a city of your choosing.
If you don’t like the position of your widgets on the screen, you can always 
move them to a new location. To move a widget, click it and drag it to its 
new position. After you use a widget, you can hide Dashboard, and all its 
widgets are out of sight once more.
	
Many widgets, including the weather widget, rely on an Internet connection. 
If you aren’t connected to the Internet when you display such a widget, the 
widget can’t display the latest information.

Getting to Know Your Dashboard Widgets
Customizing a widget
Some widgets always appear the same way, such as the calculator widget. 
Other widgets let you customize them to change their appearance or the 
type of data they display. To customize a widget, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Press the Dashboard key to open Dashboard and display all your 
widgets (or press Fn+F12 if your Mac’s keyboard doesn’t have a 
dedicated Dashboard key).
	
2.	 Hover the mouse on the widget you want to customize and then click 
the Information button, as shown in Figure 1-2.
	
	 The i button (the Information button) appears only for widgets you can 
customize, such as the weather widget.
	
Figure 1-2:

tion button 
lets you 
know you  
can custom- 
ize a widget.
	
Information button
	
3.	 Click any check boxes the widget may provide to display additional 
information, type the new information you want the widget to display, 
and then click Done.
	
	 In this case, type the city and state or zip code of a city whose weather 
forecast you want to keep track of, as shown in Figure 1-3, and check the 
Include Lows in 6-Day Forecast if you want to see that information as well.

Displaying and then clicking a widget changes or expands the information 
that appears. For instance, clicking the weather widget shows or hides the 
six-day forecast, and clicking the day/date display of the calendar widget 
toggles the month-at-a-glance and upcoming appointments displays. Click 
other widgets to discover whether they offer other additional displays.
Customizing the Dashboard shortcut key
By default, new and recent Macs use the Dashboard special function key 
(which it shares with F4) to open and close Dashboard. Mac keyboards with 
the Function key (Fn) can also display the Dashboard when you press Fn+F12. 
If you want to change this (or any other shortcut key, for that matter — click a 
different shortcut in Step 3 if desired), you can do so by following these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preference, and then click the Keyboard icon to 
open the Keyboard preferences pane.
	
2.	 Click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab, and then click Dashboard & Dock in 
the left column, as shown in Figure 1-4.
	
3.	 Double-click the Dashboard shortcut in the right column — the default 
is F12 — to highlight it, then hold down the Fn key and press the func­
tion key you want to assign to Dashboard.
	
	 You can also assign one or more modifier keys and keyboard keys to the 
Dashboard feature. For instance, if you press Ô+Control+D in this step, 
that key combination then replaces the Dashboard feature’s default key 
assignment of Fn+F12.
	
4.	 Click the Close button or press Ô+Q to close the Keyboard prefer­
ences pane.

Adding and Removing Widgets
Adding and Removing Widgets
When you open Dashboard, you see several widgets, even if you actually 
want to use just one widget. In case you don’t want to see a particular widget, 
you can remove it from Dashboard. (Don’t worry; you can always put it back 
on Dashboard again.) Conversely, you can also add more widgets to your 
Dashboard.
Removing a widget from Dashboard
When you remove a widget from Dashboard, you don’t physically delete the 
widget. Instead, you just tuck the widget into storage where you can retrieve 
it later. To remove a widget from Dashboard, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Press the Dashboard key or Fn+F12 to open Dashboard and display all 
your widgets.
	
2.	 Click the plus sign button that appears inside a circle in the bottom-
left corner of the screen to display Close buttons in the upper-left 
corner of every widget, as shown in Figure 1-5.
	
	 If you hover the pointer on the widget you want to remove and hold 
down the Option key, a Close button appears in the upper-right corner 
of just that one widget (and you don’t have to click the circled plus 
sign icon).

3.	 Click the Close button of the widget you want to remove to make it 
disappear from the screen.
	
4.	 Press the Dashboard key or Fn+F12 to close Dashboard.
	
Clicking anywhere on the screen except on another widget is another way to 
close Dashboard.
Displaying more widgets in Dashboard
When you open Dashboard, you see only a handful of all the widgets in the 
Dashboard’s library of widgets that come with every Mac. In addition to 
these, you can download additional widgets from the Web.
Table 1-1 lists all of Dashboard’s available widgets that you can choose to 
display every time you open Dashboard, some of which are shown in Figure 
1-6. (Note: Apple may have changed the lineup since I wrote this, so keep in 
mind that your mileage may vary.)

Finding New Widgets
To display a hidden Dashboard widget, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Press the Dashboard key or Fn+F12 to open Dashboard, and then click 
the plus sign that appears inside a circle in the bottom-left corner of 
the screen to display a list of widgets (refer to Figure 1-1).
	
2.	 Click a widget that you want to display in Dashboard, such as ESPN or 
Stocks, to make it appear on the screen.
	
	 Click the left or right arrows on either side of the widget list to scroll 
through all the widgets your Mac has to offer.
	
3.	 Move the cursor to the widget, click and drag the widget to wherever 
you want it to appear on your screen, and then release the mouse button.
	
4.	 Press the Dashboard key or Fn+F12 to close Dashboard.
	
	 All your widgets disappear. The next time you open Dashboard, your 
newly added widgets appear on the screen.
	
You can have multiple instances of the same widget opened at the same 
time. For instance, to track the weather in two or more cities, you can just 
repeat Step 2 in the above for each additional instance of the Weather you 
want to display.
	
To create your own widgets from a section of a Web page you’re viewing 
with Safari, choose File➪Open in Dashboard and then drag the selection box 
to the section you want to turn into a Dashboard widget, as I explain in more 
detail in Book IV, Chapter 1.
Finding New Widgets
Dashboard comes with a library of widgets, but people are always creating 
more, which you can browse and download by visiting Apple’s Web site. To 
find the latest widgets, follow these steps:
So you wanna be a widget star?
If you have an idea for a cool widget, you can 
try creating one yourself by using the free 
Dashcode program. (You might need to retrieve 
Dashcode from your Mac OS X 10.6 instal­
lation disc, or you can download Dashcode 
from Apple’s Web site at www.apple.com/
macosx/developer.) Dashcode provides 
templates to help you create a widget. Who 
knows? With a little bit of creativity and a little 
help from Dashcode, you could create the next 
widget that appears on Apple’s Web site one 
day.

Finding New Widgets
	
1.	 Visit Apple’s Web site (www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard) 
using your favorite browser (such as Safari) to access the widget 
download page, as shown in Figure 1-7.
	
Figure 1-7:

2.	 Click a category, such as Business, Food, or Games, to display a list of 
the category’s widgets in the middle pane.
	
3.	 Click a widget in the middle pane to display details about the widget 
in the third pane and then click the Download button if you decide to 
add the widget to your Mac’s library of Dashboard widgets.
	
	 Your Mac downloads the chosen widget to the Downloads folder and 
displays a dialog, asking whether you want to install your newly down­
loaded widget in Dashboard, as shown in Figure 1-8.

Disabling and Deleting Widgets from Dashboard
	
4.	 Click the Install button to give your Mac permission to open Dashboard 
and install the new widget; then click the widget and drag it to where 
you want it to appear on your screen.
	
	 If Safari doesn’t ask whether you want to install the widget, as shown 
in Figure 1-8, you might need to activate the Open “Safe” Files after 
Downloading option in Safari’s preferences window, as shown in Figure 
1-9. To do so, choose Safari➪Preferences (click the General preferences 
icon if it isn’t already selected) and then check the box next to Open 
“Safe” Files after Downloading. Click the Close button to close the Safari 
preferences window.

Disabling and Deleting Widgets from Dashboard
If you keep installing new widgets, eventually your list of available widgets 
can get crowded and overwhelming. To reduce the number of available wid­
gets, you can disable or delete them.
Disabling a widget hides it from view but keeps it stored on your hard drive 
in case you change your mind and decide to display it after all. Deleting a 
widget physically removes it from your hard drive.

for display through Dashboard.
	
4.	 Click the Close button of the Manage Widgets window and then press 
the Dashboard button (or Fn+F12) or click anywhere on the screen 
(except over a widget) to close the Dashboard.
	
To re-enable a widget you disabled, repeat these same steps except click 
any unchecked widgets to enable them again so they reappear in the row of 
available dashboard widgets you can display when you activate Dashboard.
Deleting a widget
You can delete any widgets that you install (see the “Finding New Widgets” 
section, earlier in this chapter, for more about downloading additional wid­
gets). To delete a widget, follow these steps:

Peeking at Other Widget Programs
In addition to using your Mac’s Dashboard feature to display widgets, two 
other free programs work like Dashboard: Yahoo! Widgets and Google 
Desktop (which prefers to use the term gadgets to refer to what Yahoo and 
Apple call widgets).
As Figure 1-12 shows, Yahoo! Widgets and Google Desktop can display bite-
size bits of information similar to the Mac Dashboard.
You can download Yahoo! Widgets by steering your Web browser to 
widgets.yahoo.com; Google Desktop can be downloaded by visiting 
desktop.google.com.

Chapter 2: Protecting Your 
Data with Time Machine 
and Other Programs
In This Chapter

✓	Working with data-recovery programs
✓	Encrypting your data
B
acking up data is something that many people routinely ignore, like 
changing the oil in their car on a regular basis. The only time most 
people think about backing up their data is after they’ve already lost some­
thing important, such as a business presentation, or a folder full of close-to-
the-heart family photos. Of course, by that time, it’s already too late.
Backing up your data might not sound as exciting as playing video games or 
browsing the Web, but it should be a part of your everyday routine. If you 
can’t risk losing your data, you can’t risk not taking the time to back it up.
Understanding Different Backup Options
The simplest and most obvious solution for backing up your data is to make 
duplicate copies of every important file. Although this seems simple in 
theory, you must make sure to copy your files periodically, such as at the 
end of every day. If you forget to copy your files, your backup copies could 
become woefully outdated, which can make them nearly useless. 
Another issue with backing up data concerns storing and retrieving it. If 
you store duplicates of your important files on your hard drive, you have 
to make sure you don’t accidentally use those backup files instead of the 
original files (and then accidentally copy the obsolete original files over the 
backup copies that are actually more current). Additionally, if you experi­
ence a hardware problem with your hard drive and it stops working, you 
lose both your original files and your backup files.

178
Understanding Different Backup Options
To back up your files, consider using more than one method, because the 
more backup copies you have of your critical files, the more likely it is that 
you’ll never lose your data no matter what might happen to your Mac.
	
To reduce the amount of storage space needed to store copies of your files, 
you can archive and compress your files into a ZIP or DMG file. (See Book I, 
Chapter 5 for more information about creating ZIP and DMG files.)
Using your hard drive
The simplest way to back up your files is to create and store duplicate 
copies of the files in a backup folder on your Mac’s hard drive. This method 
has the advantage of not requiring that you buy any new equipment. The 
huge disadvantage of this option is that if your Mac’s hard drive fails, you 
might lose both your original data and any backup files you have stored.
Another problem is that the more data you need to back up, the more space 
both your original and backup files will gobble up, until eventually, you might 
run out of room on your hard drive. For these reasons, using your hard drive 
to store backup copies of files is suitable for backing up a handful of files, 
but it’s both impractical and risky for backing up large amounts of data.
Backing up to CDs/DVDs
Every Mac can write to CDs, and most Macs can write to DVDs. As a result, 
storing backups on CDs or DVDs is a popular option because CDs and DVDs 
are easy to store and are durable. The biggest drawback of CDs and DVDs 
is their limited storage capacities. CDs can store up to 700MB of data, and 
DVDs can store 4.7GB of data, with the newest dual-layer DVDs capable of 
storing up to 8.5GB of data. 
	
A dual-layer disc employs a second physical layer within the disc, which the 
drive accesses by shining its laser through the disc’s first, semitransparent 
layer.
If you need to back up only word processor or spreadsheet files, a single CD 
should be sufficient. However, music, video, and digital photographs take up 
more space, which means that you might need to use several CDs or DVDs to 
back up all your files of those types.
DVDs can store much more data than CDs, but even they can be limited 
when you’re backing up hard drives that contain several gigabytes worth of 
files. The more discs you need to back up your files completely, the harder 
to keep track of all the discs.
Storing data on multiple discs can be slow and tedious, which means you 
might not back up your data as often as you should. Eventually, this means 
your backup files are too out of date to be useful, which defeats the purpose 
of backing up your data.

Book II
Chapter 2
Protecting Your Data 
with Time Machine 
and Other Programs
179
Understanding Different Backup Options
Fitting your most crucial files on a CD or DVD can be a simple and fast 
backup option. But if your data frequently exceeds the storage limits of a 
single CD or DVD, using multiple discs can be cumbersome, and you should 
probably rely on another backup method.
Storing backups on USB flash drives
The low-cost and high-storage capacities of USB flash drives make them an 
attractive alternative to using CDs for backing up your most crucial files. 
USB flash drives offer ease of use because you can plug them into any open 
USB port in a Mac and move them to another Mac. Many USB flash drives 
have built-in keyrings. Carrying one in your pocket or purse is not only con­
venient, but also assures that your data is always safe and on your person 
should something happen to your Mac’s hard drive at home or in the office, 
where your backup drive’s original files are stored.
The biggest drawback of USB flash drives is their limited storage capaci­
ties, which typically range from 1GB to 32GB or sometimes more. While USB 
flash drives in those capacity ranges can usually cost between $5 and $100, 
a whopping 128GB model sold Amazon (www.amazon.com) costs around 
$400. Whatever the capacity, USB flash drives are especially convenient for 
carrying your most critical files but not necessarily for backing up all your 
important files. In contrast to the hassles of writing (or burning) data to a CD 
or DVD, saving files to a USB flash drive is speedier and as simple as saving a 
file to a backup folder on your hard drive.
	
If you lose your USB flash drive, anyone who finds it can open and view 
your files. If the idea of strangers peeking at your files gives you the heebie-
jeebies, consider buying a special USB flash drive that offers encryption to 
protect your files from anyone who doesn’t have your password.
Backing up with external hard drives
To prevent the loss of all your data if your hard drive should suddenly bite 
the dust, you can use external hard drives that connect to your Mac’s USB or 
FireWire port with a cable that’s typically included with the hard drive. 
	
Both USB (Universal Serial Bus) and FireWire ports connect peripherals to a 
computer. USB ports commonly connect a mouse, printer, or digital camera, 
and FireWire ports often connect video camcorders or other computers. 
FireWire ports and USB 2.0 ports transfer data at roughly the same speed, 
so one isn’t necessarily better than the other. The MacBook Air and a few 
earlier-model MacBooks lack a FireWire port, so if you’re in the market for 
a new Mac, and your digital camera or video camcorder can only connect 
using a FireWire cable, make sure the Mac model you’re considering offers a 
FireWire port.
The main advantage of external hard drives is that copying large files is 
much faster and more convenient than copying the same files to CD/DVD 

180
Understanding Different Backup Options
discs, and they offer more capacity than USB drives. Additionally, external 
hard drives are easy to unplug from one Mac and plug into another Mac. 
Because of their low cost, fast copying speed, and ease of moving and plug­
ging into any Mac, external hard drives are the most popular choice for 
backing up files.
Perhaps the biggest drawback of external hard drives is that they can’t pro­
tect against a catastrophe near your computer, such as a fire burning down 
your house or a flood soaking your computer desk and office. If a disaster 
wipes out the entire area around your computer, your external hard drive 
might be wiped out in the catastrophe as well.
You can treat an external hard drive as just another place to copy your files, 
but for greater convenience, you should use a special backup program. 
Backup programs can be set to run according to a schedule (for example, to 
back up your files every night at 6:00 p.m.)
If the files haven’t changed since the last time you backed them up, the 
backup program saves time by skipping over those files rather than copying 
the same files to the external hard drive again.
	
To retrieve files, you could just copy the files from your external hard drive 
back to your original hard drive, but be careful! If you changed a file on your 
original hard drive, copying the backup copy can wipe out the most recent 
changes and restore an old file to your hard drive, which probably isn’t what 
you want. 
To keep you from accidentally wiping out new files with older versions of 
that same file, backup programs always compare the time and date a file 
was last modified to make sure you always have copies of the latest file. To 
try a free backup program for use with an external hard drive, grab a copy 
of SilverKeeper (www.lacie.com/silverkeeper), PsyncX (http://
psyncx.sourceforge.net), Carbon Copy Cloner (www.bombich.com), or 
SuperDuper (www.shirt-pocket.com).
Storing backups off-site
Backing up your Mac’s important files to an off-site storage service virtually 
guarantees that you’ll never lose your data.
Many low-cost (and even free) off-site storage options are available for 
Mac users. One simple way to create off-site storage is to open a free e-mail 
account, such as Google Gmail (www.gmail.com), and e-mail yourself your 
important files. Now you can always retrieve your important files from any­
where in the world that offers Internet access.
Many companies sell off-site storage space for a monthly fee. However, to 
entice you to try their services, they often provide a limited amount of free 
space that you can use for an unlimited period at no cost whatsoever. To get

Apple’s MobileMe service, which costs $99 a year, can automatically syn­
chronize your Mac’s Address Book contacts, iCal calendar events, Safari 
bookmarks, as well as backup files and folders between multiple Macs or 
between your Mac and your iPhone, iPod touch music and media player, 
or Windows PC you might also use. MobileMe (www.me.com) also provides 
you with an iDisk online backup storage space that you can access from the 
Finder just like a hard drive; however, copying files to and from your iDisk is 
slower than copying to a locally connected drive. 
Blasting into the Past with Time Machine
One problem with traditional backup programs is that they store the latest 
or last two or three previous versions of your files. Normally, this is exactly 
what you want, but what if you want to see an earlier version of a short story 
you began working on two weeks ago? Unless you kept a copy of your back­
ups you made two weeks ago, trying to find files created on certain dates in 
the past is nearly impossible.
Fortunately, that type of problem is trivial for your Mac’s backup program, 
Time Machine. Unlike traditional backup programs that copy and store the 
latest or last one or two versions of files, Time Machine takes snapshots of 
your Mac hard drive so that you can view its exact condition from two hours 
ago, two weeks ago, two months ago, or farther back. Note: The external 
hard drive you use to back up your Mac with Time Machine should have 
oodles of storage space. The bigger the hard drive, the farther back in time 
you can go to recover old files and information.
By viewing the exact condition of what your Mac hard drive looked like in 
the past, you can see exactly what your files looked like at that time. After 
you find a specific file version from the past, you can easily restore it to the 
present with a click of the mouse.
Setting up Time Machine
To use Time Machine, you need to connect an external hard drive to your 
Mac with a USB or FireWire cable, or have an additional hard drive installed 
in one of the additional drive bays inside your Mac Pro desktop computer.

To set up Time Machine to back up the data on your Mac’s primary hard 
drive to an external hard drive, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Connect the external hard drive to your Mac.
	
	 When you plug in a new hard drive, the Time Machine backup feature 
typically starts automatically and asks if you want to use the hard drive 
to back up your Mac, as shown in Figure 2-1.

How Time Machine does its backup thing
The first time you turn on and begin using Time 
Machine, it backs up your Mac’s entire hard 
drive — which can take a long time if your 
Mac’s hard drive contains lots of programs 
and data. One thing you can do is start the Time 
Machine backup before going to bed, so when 
you wake the next morning your Mac will be 
completely (or almost completely) backed up.
After its initial backup of your Mac’s hard drive, 
Time Machine automatically performs an incre­
mental backup of any data changed on your 
Mac’s hard drive (providing the backup drive 
is attached) every hour. Time Machine saves 
hourly backups for the past 24 hours, daily 
backups for the past month, and weekly back­
ups for everything older than a month. Time 
Machine skips backing up files you created and 
then deleted before the next hourly backup. 
When your external backup hard drive starts 
running out of free space for more backups, 
Time Machine deletes the oldest files it finds in 
order to make room for the newer ones.

not want to back up your Applications folder if you already have all your 
programs stored on separate installation discs. Or you might choose to skip 
backing up TV episodes your Mac recorded using the EyeTV program (sold 
separately; www.eyetv.com) because you always record the same episodes 
on the TiVo or other Digital Video Recorder (DVR) in the family room, so 
there’s no use wasting all of that precious space on your Mac’s backup drive. 
To tell Time Machine which files or folders to skip, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Time Machine icon

your MacBook when it’s running on battery power. Turning this 
option on will drain your MacBook’s battery faster than if you turn 
this option off.
 
• Notify After Old Backups Are Deleted: Time Machine displays a dialog 
requesting your approval before it deletes any old backup files.
	
6.	 Click the Done button and then click the Close button to close the 
Time Machine preferences pane.
Retrieving files and folders
After you configure Time Machine to back up your Mac, you can use the 
Time Machine recovery program to retrieve old files or information you 
deleted or changed after Time Machine backed them up. The two ways to 
use the Time Machine recovery program to recover files, folders, or other 
pieces of information, such as address cards, e-mail messages, or iCal calen­
dar items, are as follows:
	
✦	 By running an application and then clicking the Time Machine icon in 
the Dock, or choosing the Enter Time Machine command from the Time 
Machine icon on the menu bar.
	
✦	 By clicking the Finder icon in the Dock to open a new Finder window and 
then clicking the Time Machine icon in the Dock, or choosing the Enter 
Time Machine command from the Time Machine icon on the menu bar.
Time Machine consists of two components:
	
✦	 The Time Machine preferences pane (described earlier in this section) 
that you use to turn the Time Machine backup feature on or off, or to 
adjust its settings.
	
✦	 The Time Machine restore program you use to recover files you deleted 
or changed from earlier backups. You run the restore program by click­
ing the Time Machine icon in the Dock, or by choosing the Enter Time 
Machine command from the Time Machine icon on the menu bar.

Recovering data from within an application
To use Time Machine to retrieve a specific piece of information from within 
a program (such as an address card from your Mac’s Address Book, which I 
use in this example), follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Address Book icon in the Dock to launch Address Book.
	
	 The Address Book program opens and displays the Address Book 
window, which lists all your contacts.
	
2.	 Click the Time Machine icon in the Dock (or click the Time Machine 
icon on the menu bar and choose Enter Time Machine) to run the 
Time Machine recovery program.
	
	 If the Time Machine icon doesn’t appear in the Dock or the menu bar, 
you have to double-click the Time Machine icon in the Applications 
folder.
	
	 Your Mac’s screen will appear to literally space out while it launches the 
Time Machine restore program into another dimension known as The 
Time Machine Zone, as shown in Figure 2-8.

3.	 Choose one of the following ways to select a contact card (or cards) 
that you want to restore from a past backup:
 
• Click the Backward and Forward Arrow buttons near the bottom-right 
corner of the screen. Click the Backward button to move the Address 
Book window backward in time to earlier Time Machine backups. 
Click the Forward button to move forward to more recent Time 
Machine backups.
 
• Click an Address Book window in the stack of windows behind the 
frontmost Address Book window. You can click the Address Book 
window directly behind the front Address Book window, or one 
behind it stretching farther back in time. Each time you click an 
Address Book window in the stack, Time Machine moves it to the 
front of the screen. 
 
• Move the pointer to the Time Machine timeline along the right edge of 
the screen. The timeline bars expand to display a specific date. To 
choose a specific date, click it.
	
4.	 When you locate the contact card you want to retrieve, click it, click the 
Restore button in the lower-right corner, and then proceed to Step 6.
	
	 To select more than one contact card, hold down the Ô key and click 
each additional contact you want to recover.
	
5.	 If the contact you want to restore is nowhere to be found in the 
Address Book windows — or if you change your mind and don’t want 
to recover a backed up contact — click the Cancel button in the lower-
left corner (or press the Escape key).
	
	 Time Machine closes and returns you to the present. 
	
6.	 The Time Machine Address Book window zooms forward and then 
closes, returning you to the Address Book program window, which 
now includes the recovered contact card (or cards).
	
	 That’s it — you’ve been saved!
	
You can perform these same steps to recover data that you typically create 
and use within a particular program, such as iPhoto pictures, iTunes music, 
movies and other audio files, and iCal calendar events.
Retrieving files and/or folders using the Finder
To use the Finder window to retrieve files, folders, or a combination of both 
with the Time Machine recovery program, follow these steps:

Working with Data-Recovery Programs
Suppose you’re a well-protected Mac user who backs up your data regularly. 
You’re completely safe, right, and you never have to worry about losing files 
you can’t retrieve? Not exactly. Here are three situations where backup pro­
grams can’t help you, and you might need to rely on special data-recovery 
programs instead.

Book II 
Chapter 2
Protecting Your Data  
with Time Machine 
and Other Programs
191
Working with Data-Recovery Programs
Data-recovery programs work by taking advantage of the way computers store 
and organize files by physically placing them in certain areas, known as sec­
tors, on your Mac’s internal hard drive (or removable storage device). To 
learn more about the nitty-gritty of how hard disks manage files, check out the 
nearby sidebar, “Hard drive: A tale of control, corruption, and redemption.”
You can lose files in these ways in which your backups can’t help you:
	
✦	 Accidentally deleted from the hard drive: The most common way to lose a 
file is by accidentally deleting it. If you try to recover your lost file through a 
backup program, such as Time Machine, you might be shocked to find that 
your backup program can recover only your file from the previous hour or 
older, but not in the span of time between Time Machine backups. So if you 
spent the last 45 minutes changing a file and accidentally deleted it before 
Time Machine was able to run its next automatic backup, you’re out of luck 
as far as recovering the changes you made in the last 45 minutes.
Hard drive: A tale of control, 
corruption, and redemption
To keep track of where each file is stored, 
your Mac maintains a directory that tells the 
computer the names of every file and the exact 
physical location where each file is stored. 
When different programs, such as word pro­
cessors or spreadsheets, need to find and open 
a file, these programs depend on the Mac OS X 
operating system to keep track of this directory 
so they know where to find a file.
When you delete a file, the computer simply 
removes that file’s name from the directory. 
However, your file still physically exists on 
the disk surface, but the computer can’t find 
it again. Therefore, data-recovery programs 
ignore the directory listing of a disk and search 
for a file by examining every part of the entire 
storage device to find your missing files.
If you didn’t add any files since you last deleted 
the file you want to retrieve, a data-recovery 
program will likely retrieve your entire file 
again. If you saved and modified files since 
you last deleted a particular file, there’s a good 
chance any new or modified files might have 
written over the area that contains your deleted 
file. In this case, your chances of recovering 
the entire file intact drops rapidly over time.
If a hardware failure corrupts a file, all or 
part of your file might be wiped out for good. 
However, in many cases, a hardware failure 
won’t physically destroy all or part of a file. 
Instead, a hardware failure might physically 
scramble a file, much like throwing a pile of 
clothes all over the room. In this case, the file 
still physically exists, but the directory of the 
disk won’t know where all the parts of the file 
have been scattered. So, to the computer, your 
files have effectively disappeared.
A data-recovery program can piece together 
scattered files by examining the physical sur­
face of a disk, gathering up file fragments, and 
putting them back together again like Humpty 
Dumpty. Depending on how badly corrupted a 
file might be, collecting file fragments and put­
ting them back together can recover an entire 
file or just part of a file, but sometimes recover­
ing part of a file can be better than losing the 
whole file.

192
Working with Data-Recovery Programs
	
✦	 Hardware failure: Another way to lose a file is through a hardware 
failure, such as your hard drive mangling portions of its disk surface or 
corrupting a file because a power outage knocked out your Mac without 
properly shutting it down first, thereby wrecking any open files that you 
were working on or that were stored. Such a failure can go unnoticed 
because the hard drive still works. As a result, your backup program 
copies and saves these mangled versions of your file. The moment you 
discover your file is corrupted, you also find that your backup program 
has been diligently copying and saving the same corrupted version of 
your file. 
	
✦	 Deleted from removable media: You might lose data by deleting it 
from removable media, such as a USB flash drive or digital camera flash 
memory card (such as a Compact Flash or Secure Digital card). Most 
likely, your backup programs protect only your hard drive files, not any 
removable storage devices, which means you could take twenty price­
less pictures of your dog doing midair back-flip Frisbee catches, only 
to delete all those pictures by mistake (and tanking your dog’s chances 
at YouTube stardom). Because your backup program might never have 
saved those files, you can’t recover what was never saved.
	
Even if you format and erase your entire hard drive, your files may still phys­
ically remain on the hard drive, making it possible to recover those files.
Some popular data-recovery programs include:
	
✦	 Disk Warrior (www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior; $99): Builds a new 
replacement directory using data recovered from the original directory, 
thereby recovering files, folders, and documents that you thought were 
gone forever.
	
✦	 FileSalvage (www.subrosasoft.com; $90): FileSalvage retrieves 
deleted and corrupted files from your Mac’s hard drive.
	
✦	 Stellar Phoenix Macintosh and Stellar Phoenix Photo Recovery (www.
stellarinfo.com; $99): Stellar Phoenix Macintosh retrieves deleted 
and corrupted files. Stellar Phoenix Photo Recovery recovers deleted 
files from flash memory cards.
	
✦	 Klix (www.joesoft.com; $30): Specialized program for recovering lost 
digital images stored on flash memory cards, such as Secure Digital or 
Compact Flash cards.
	
✦	 Data Rescue II (www.prosofteng.com; $100): This program recovers 
and retrieves data from a hard drive your Mac can no longer access 
because of a hard disk failure.
	
✦	 Mac Data Recovery (www.datarecoverymac.com; $145): This pro­
gram specializes in recovering files from corrupted or reformatted hard 
drives.

Encrypting Data with FileVault
Encrypting Data with FileVault
Sometimes your biggest threat isn’t from hardware failure or accidentally 
deleting your data, but from the prying eyes of others who want to peek at 
your data. To protect your data, you can take one or more of the following 
steps:
	
✦	 Physically lock your Mac behind closed doors (armed guards optional).
	
✦	 Make sure everyone using your Mac has his or her own separate 
account (see Book I, Chapter 6 for more information about creating 
accounts).
	
✦	 Encrypt your files by using the Mac’s built-in encryption program called 
FileVault.
Encryption physically scrambles your files so that even if people can access 
your files, they can’t open or edit them unless they know the correct pass­
word. When you use FileVault, your Mac encrypts your entire home folder 
that contains your folders, including Documents, Music, and Pictures.
	
FileVault uses an encryption algorithm called Advanced Encryption Standard 
(AES), which is the latest American government standard for scrambling 
data that even national governments with supercomputers can’t crack.
Most anything you store on your Mac can be 
recovered, given enough time and money. 
When most people lose data, they’re thankful 
when a data-recovery program can retrieve 
their files. However, in the criminal world, 
people may want to delete files so that nobody 
can ever find them again to hide evidence. To 
retrieve such deleted files, law enforcement 
agencies rely on something called computer 
forensics.
The basic idea behind computer forensics is to 
make an exact copy of a hard drive and then try 
to piece together the deleted files on that copy 
of the original hard drive. Some criminals have 
lit hard drives on fire, poured acid on them, 
and sliced them apart with a buzz saw — and 
law enforcement agencies can still manage to 
read and recover the files from the slivers of 
hard drive fragments that contain the magnetic 
traces of the original files.
The good news is that if you can’t recover a file 
yourself by using a data-recovery program, you 
can often hire a professional service that can 
recover your data for you — but that data better 
be really important to you, because the cost of 
data recovery services like those offered by 
DriveSavers (www.drivesaversdata
recovery.com) is very expensive.
The art of computer forensics

Encrypting Data with FileVault
Setting up FileVault
FileVault scrambles your files so that only your password (or the system’s 
Master Password) can unlock the files so you — or someone you trust and 
give the password to — can read them. When you type in a password, you 
can access your files and use them normally, but as soon as you close a file, 
FileVault scrambles it once more. FileVault works in the background so that 
you never even see it working.
	
FileVault uses your login password to encrypt your data. For added safety, 
FileVault prompts you to create a second password, a master password that 
can decrypt any encrypted files for all user accounts and the files for each 
account that you have stored on your Mac. If you forget your login password 
and your master password, your data will be encrypted forever with no hope 
of unscrambling and retrieving it again.
To turn on FileVault, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Security icon to 
open the Security preferences pane.
	
	 The Security preferences pane appears.
	
2.	 Click the FileVault tab to open the FileVault preferences pane, as

Phone or PDA with iSync

M
any people I know laboriously type contact names, phone numbers, 
and other information into their mobile phones one thumb-numbing 
keystroke at a time. Such a waste of time and energy when they could 
simply connect their mobile phone (or PDA) to their Mac and transfer 
their Address Book contacts, iCal calendar events and other information 
in a matter of minutes using iSync, which comes preloaded on every Mac. 
What’s more, anytime you add, change, or delete information on your Mac 
or on your mobile device, you can run iSync again so that the two sides are 
always on the same proverbial page, so to speak.
Connecting a Mobile Phone or PDA to a Mac
Many people store names and contact information on their mobile phones 
or personal digital assistant (PDA) handheld devices. However, such mobile, 
handheld devices create two main problems. First, if you already store 
names, contact information, and appointments using iCal and Address Book 
on your Mac, you probably don’t want to retype this information into your 
mobile device. Second, if you lose your mobile phone or PDA, you could 
wind up losing all of your important contact information.
To prevent both of these problems, your Mac comes with a program called 
iSync. By using iSync, you can connect and transfer data between your Mac 
and many handheld devices, such as a mobile phone or PDA. Now you can 
type a name on your mobile phone’s contacts program, type an appoint­
ment on your Mac using iCal, and then run iSync to bring all this information 
together by updating your contact information and schedule on both your 
mobile phone and your Mac.

198
Connecting a Mobile Phone or PDA to a Mac
Besides sharing contact information and appointments between your Mac 
and a handheld device, iSync also lets you transfer files from your Mac to 
your handheld device. If you need to read some important documents, trans­
fer them from your Mac to your mobile phone or PDA so you can read them 
in an airport terminal, while waiting in line at the supermarket, or any time 
you’re away from your Mac. 
	
The iSync program can work with a wide variety of mobile phones and Palm 
PDAs. For a complete list of devices compatible with iSync, visit Apple’s Web 
site (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2824). If you have a Windows 
Mobile, a BlackBerry, Palm Pre, or an older Palm OS device, you can buy a 
program called Missing Sync for your particular device from Mark/Space 
(www.markspace.com), which will allow you to synchronize your data with 
a Mac.
	
I don’t tell you about synchronizing an iPhone or an iPod Touch with iSync 
in this section because you synchronize your iPhone with your Mac using 
iTunes (or Apple’s MobileMe service). You can also use iTunes to copy 
your calendar and contacts to your iPod, but you cannot add, edit, or delete 
those contacts or calendar items from your iPod and then synchronize those 
changes to your Mac.
The three basic steps for using iSync are
	
1.	 Add your handheld device to your Mac’s iSync Devices list.
	
	 This links the handheld device to your Mac. The idea here is to keep 
your handheld device from trying to synchronize with multiple Macs, 
which could prevent contact information and appointments from syn­
chronizing correctly. You need to add a handheld device to your Mac 
only once.
	
2.	 Connect the handheld device with your Mac.
	
	 Handheld devices connect through either a USB cable or Bluetooth wire­
less connection.
	
3.	 Decide what to transfer or synchronize between your Mac and the hand­
held device. 
	
	 You can specify whether to synchronize and transfer names and contact 
information, appointments, or files, such as word processor or spread­
sheet files.
Adding a handheld device to your Mac
Before you can use iSync to synchronize data between your Mac and your 
handheld device, you need to add the handheld device to iSync.

In case you want to synchronize your handheld device with another com­
puter, you must first remove the device from the iSync Devices list on your 
Mac by following these steps:
	
1.	 Run the iSync program by double-clicking the iSync icon in the 
Applications folder.
	
2.	 In the iSync window, click the icon for the handheld device that you 
want to remove. 
	
3.	 Choose Devices➪Remove Device.
Synchronizing a handheld device with your Mac
After you add a handheld device to the iSync Devices list so your Mac can 
recognize it, you can synchronize and transfer data between your Mac and a 
handheld device by following these steps:
	
1.	 Connect your handheld device (mobile phone or PDA) to your Mac. 
	
	 If you have a Bluetooth handheld device, just place it near your Mac. To 
read about how to make a connection between your Bluetooth-enabled 
handheld device and your Mac (which is referred to as pairing), turn to 
Book VIII, Chapter 3.
	
2.	 Run iSync.
	
	 The iSync window appears, displaying an icon for your handheld device, 
as shown in Figure 3-2.

Your iSync setup experience might vary. Some devices, such as my spare 
Nokia 6620 mobile phone that I keep in a drawer in case my Palm Pre or 
iPhone stops working, require additional steps to make them work with iSync. 
When I first added my Nokia 6620 as a device to iSync, a dialog popped up, 
informing me that I had to install a small iSync client program on the Nokia 
to allow the phone to communicate with iSync. iSync transferred the Nokia 
program to the mobile phone over Bluetooth, and the Nokia prompted me

to install the program. When installed, iSync recognized the Nokia 6620 and 
when I clicked the Sync button in iSync, my Mac’s Address Book contacts 
and iCal events transferred from the big computer to the little one.
Resetting a handheld device with your Mac
Synchronizing your handheld device with your Mac can keep your crucial 
contact and appointment information stored in two locations. However, 
sometimes the data on your handheld device might get hopelessly outdated 
if you don’t use it for a long time, or it can become scrambled if someone 
accidentally uses (plays with) your handheld device.
If this happens, the only accurate information might be on your Mac, so 
you can reset your handheld device, essentially wiping the handheld device 
clean and replacing it with the data on your Mac instead. To reset your 
handheld device, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Connect your handheld device (mobile phone or PDA) to your Mac. 
	
	 If you have a Bluetooth handheld device, just place it near your Mac. To 
read about how to make a connection between your Bluetooth-enabled 
handheld device and your Mac (which is referred to as pairing), turn to 
Book VIII, Chapter 3.
	
2.	 Run iSync.
	
	 The iSync window appears, displaying an icon for your handheld device 
(refer to Figure 3-2).
	
3.	 Click the icon of the handheld device that you want to reset.
	
	 Resetting wipes out all data stored on your handheld device, so make 
sure you don’t need any of this data.
	
4.	 Choose Devices➪Reset Device (or Reset All Devices to reset all hand­
held devices added to your Mac).

Chapter 4: Automating Your Mac
In This Chapter
✓	Getting to know Automator
✓	Understanding actions
✓	Exploring sample Automator workflows
✓	Creating Automator programs
C
omputers are supposed to make your life easier, but sometimes they 
complicate life unnecessarily. Many times, you might need to perform a 
repetitive task, such as renaming a batch of digital photographs every time 
you copy them from your digital camera. Although such a task is trivial, it’s 
also tedious and time-consuming to rename each photograph’s file.
Fortunately, your Mac can carry some of these burdens for you through a 
feature called Automator. With Automator, you can program your Mac to 
perform specific tasks that you don’t want to do yourself.
Getting Automator to Take Action for You
Automator lets you choose from a library of predefined tasks, called actions, 
which tell specific programs on your Mac what to do. By stringing these 
actions together, you can create simple workflows that act like miniprograms 
that can, for example, retrieve a Web page and read the text aloud, or rename 
groups of files automatically. 
Automator organizes its library of actions into these categories:
	
✦	 Calendar: Adds, deletes, or retrieves items from iCal.
	
✦	 Contacts: Finds and retrieves names from the Address Book.
	
✦	 Files & Folder: Manipulates items within the Finder.
	
✦	 Fonts: Adds, retrieves, and deletes fonts from the Font Book.
	
✦	 Internet: Retrieves Web pages from the Internet using Safari.
	
✦	 Mail: Finds and retrieves messages from Mail.
	
✦	 Movies: Plays, converts, or retrieves images using iDVD, DVD Player, 
and QuickTime Player.
	
✦	 Music: Manipulates songs in iTunes and on an iPod.
	
✦	 PDF: Renames, searches, converts, and retrieves data from PDF files.

204
Getting Automator to Take Action for You
	
✦	 Photos: Manipulates digital photographs.
	
✦	 Presentations: Plays and displays slides in a Keynote presentation.
	
✦	 Text: Manipulates text within the TextEdit program.
	
✦	 Utilities: Provides a variety of tasks for burning CDs/DVDs and running 
or quitting programs. Also contains the Watch Me Do task, which lets 
you record mouse and keyboard actions.
Most actions need to accept input. For example, if you create an action 
that retrieves a Web page from the Web, its input would be a specific Web site 
address, such as www.JOEyGADGET.com. You can also make an action more flex­
ible, such as by having it ask you for input or retrieve input from another action.
After an action receives input, it does something with that input, such as renam­
ing files a certain way or running a program. Many actions also create some form 
of output, which can be used as another action’s input. Figure 4-1 shows two 
simple actions. The first action, Get Specified Text, retrieves a chunk of text. The 
second action, Speak Text, uses a computer-synthesized voice to read the text.
Actions link via compatible input and output. That is, an action that pro­
duces text as output can link to another action that accepts text as input. 
However, an action that produces text as output can’t link to an action that 
accepts a PDF file as input. The output from one action must always be com­
patible with the input of another action if the two are to cooperate. If the 
output and input of two actions aren’t compatible, Automator won’t display 
the connecting input and output links between actions.
When using Automator, you need to understand the Automator user interface. 
The left pane displays Automator’s library of actions, organized by categories 
that reflect applications on your Mac, including the Finder. By clicking an appli­
cation’s library, the middle pane lists specific actions stored in that library. 
Clicking an action displays a brief description in the bottom-left corner of 
the Automator window. The right pane is where you drag and drop actions 
to link them and form a complete Automator workflow.
Understanding Actions
To create a workflow, you need to link actions together. However, even 
though Automator provides many different types of actions, not every action 
can link together. To help you understand the variety of actions available, 
actions typically work with one of four types of objects:
	
✦	 Files and folders
	
✦	 Music (audio) files
	
✦	 Digital photographs
	
✦	 Text

Book II
Chapter 4
Automating 
Your Mac
205
Getting Automator to Take Action for You
	
Figure 4-1: 
One action’s 
output is 
another 
action’s 
input.
	
To work on different objects, such as text or digital photographs, each type 
of action automates a specific program on your Mac, such as the Finder, 
iTunes, iPhoto, Safari, iCal, or TextEdit program.
Actions either retrieve data or process the data retrieved by another action 
or sometimes nothing at all (such as with the action Pause). Actions can 
retrieve data by prompting you for input or having you make a choice when 
the workflow runs. This method gives the workflow the flexibility to work 
with different types of data, but it adds the inconvenience of not running 
completely without user intervention.
A second way actions can retrieve data is by having you specify exactly 
what type of data the action should use, such as a specific file. This method 
lets your workflow run without any intervention from you, but you lose the 
flexibility of working with different data unless you modify the action within 
Automator.
Some examples of actions that retrieve data are as follows:
	
✦	 Find Sources in iTunes: Lets you define which songs or playlists to use 
and then outputs the song or playlist.
	
✦	 Get Specified URLs: Retrieves a Web page from a specific URL, such 
as www.dummies.com or www.whitehouse.gov, and outputs the 
Web page.

206
Getting Automator to Take Action for You
	
✦	 Ask for Text: Displays a dialog so the user can enter text information 
and outputs this text information.
	
✦	 Get Specified Finder Items: Retrieves the name of a file or folder and 
outputs the name of a file or folder.
Actions that retrieve data usually then pass that data to another action that 
processes that data. Some actions that process data then create output for 
another action to use. Other actions simply accept input and then do some­
thing with that input, such as playing a specific song in iTunes or rotating a 
digital photograph. 
The following are some examples of actions that process data:
	
✦	 Play iTunes Playlist: Accepts a playlist name and starts playing the 
songs in that playlist.
	
✦	 Get Text from Webpage: Accepts a Web page, retrieves the text from 
that Web page, and outputs this text.
	
✦	 Speak Text: Accepts text and reads this text aloud in a computer-
synthesized voice.
	
✦	 Rename Finder Items: Accepts the name of a file or folder and changes 
that name.
Eventually, every workflow needs to end with an action that does something 
to data. In the preceding list, the Get Text from Webpage action accepts a 
Web page as input and sends the text of that Web page out as output. You 
can’t end a workflow with this particular action because it doesn’t do any­
thing useful that you can see or hear. However, you can retrieve text from 
the first Web page on the New York Times Web site and link the Get Text 
from Webpage action to the Speak Text action, which reads all text from the 
New York Times Web page, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Creating a workflow
The first step to creating a workflow is to pick an action that retrieves data. 
To help you get started, you can have Automator create an initial action by 
choosing a template for your workflow, by following these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the Automator icon in the Applications folder to load 
Automator. (If Automator is already running, choose File➪New.)
	
	 A dialog appears, letting you choose the type of data you want to manip­
ulate, such as folders, music, photos, or text, as shown in Figure 4-3.

Adding, rearranging, and deleting actions
After you select an action that starts your workflow by retrieving data, you 
need one or more actions that process that data. To add an action to a work­
flow, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 Click a library category in the Actions Library (left pane) of the 
Automator window, which contains the action you want to choose.
	
	 (If you need an action that works with Text, click the Text library. If you 
need an action that involves the Internet, click the Internet library.) A 
list of actions, stored in your chosen library, appears in the right column 
of the left pane of the Automator window.
	
2.	 Drag and drop an action from the right column of the Actions library 
to the workflow area (right pane) of the Automator window (or 
double-click the action to add it to the end of the workflow).
In case you place an action in the wrong location, you can move an action 
to a new location by dragging it with the mouse or clicking the action and 
choosing Action➪Move Up (or Move Down).
To delete an action, click its Close button in the upper-right corner of the 
action’s tile in the workflow. If you delete an action by mistake, press Ô+Z or 
choose Edit➪Undo.

Getting Automator to Take Action for You
Running and testing a workflow
After you arrange multiple actions into a workflow, you can test your work­
flow to make sure it works the way you want. To run a workflow, you have 
two choices:
	
✦	 Click the Run button or choose Workflow➪Run.
	
✦	 Choose Workflow➪Step.
When you run a workflow, Automator runs through every step in your work-
flow. If you choose Workflow➪Step, Automator runs one action at a time. 
Click the Step button or choose Workflow➪Step to run each additional action.
The main reason for using the Step command is to verify that each action 
is doing exactly what you want at each step of your workflow. If an action 
can’t run for some reason, Automator displays an error message, as shown 
in Figure 4-5.
	
Figure 4-5: 
An error 
message 
appears if 
an action 
can’t run 
because 
it’s not 
receiving 
the proper 
input.
	
To fix problems with your workflow, you might need to delete the faulty action 
and replace it with another one, or you might need to add another action that 
outputs the proper data that the other action can accept as input.
Saving a workflow
For any file in any program you work on, remember this: Save early and save 
often! To save a workflow, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪Save to open the Save As dialog.
	
2.	 In the Save As text box, type a descriptive name for your file.
	
3.	 Choose the Where pop-up menu, choose a folder where you want to 
store your file, and then click the Save button.

210
Creating Example Workflows
Opening a saved workflow
After you save a workflow, you can open it by following these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the Automator icon in the Applications folder to load 
Automator if it’s not already open.
	
2.	 Click the Open an Existing Workflow button. (You can also choose 
File➪Open to open an existing workflow.)
	
	 An Open dialog appears.
	
3.	 Click the workflow file you want to open and then click Open.
Creating Example Workflows
Trying to piece together actions to create a workflow can get frustrating if 
you don’t know how different actions might work. To create your own work­
flows easily, study the following examples that manipulate text, digital pho­
tographs, and files. 
	
As you can see by browsing through Automator’s libraries, dozens of other 
types of actions involve different types of programs, such as iCal or Address 
Book. Experiment with creating workflows using different actions to discover 
more ways to control your Mac than you ever thought were possible.
Playing with text
The following workflow consists of three actions, as shown in Figure 4-6:
	
✦	 Get Specified URLs: Asks for a URL (such as www.cnn.com) and 
retrieves the Web page from that site.
	
✦	 Get Text from Articles: Retrieves the text of RSS feeds.
	
✦	 New TextEdit Document: Displays the text of the RSS feeds in a TextEdit 
document that you can read or print.
	
RSS feeds are summarized headings and text that describe new content on a 
Web page. By reviewing RSS feeds from a Web site, you can decide whether 
you want to visit that Web site to read the complete article.
To create this workflow, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the Automator icon in the Applications folder to load 
Automator.
	
	 A dialog appears (refer to Figure 4-1).
	
2.	 Click the Workflow template icon and then click Choose.
	
	 The Automator window appears.

The Watch Me Do action records your mouse or keyboard commands (or 
both) as a series of actions until you stop recording your commands. You 
can then run the resultant workflow to repeat the same mouse or keyboard 
commands without needing to touch the mouse or keyboard. For example, 
if you record your mouse double-clicking the Calculator program, then your 
keyboard typing 1 + 1 = and then stop recording, The Watch Me Do action 
will repeat these commands every time you run the workflow.
To record mouse or keyboard commands in a Watch Me Do action, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Record button or choose Workflow➪Record.
	
	 Your Mac’s Desktop appears along with an Automator Recording

N
o matter how well designed and well built a Mac is, it’s still a machine, 
and all machines are liable to break down through no fault of your 
own. Many times, you can fix minor problems with a little bit of knowledge 
and willingness to poke and prod around your Mac. If your Mac isn’t working 
correctly, you can check obvious things first, like making sure it’s plugged 
in and that any connecting cables to your Mac are plugged in and secure. 
However, sometimes your Mac might be in more serious trouble than you can 
fix, so don’t be afraid to take your Mac into your friendly neighborhood com­
puter repair store (one that specializes in repairing Macs, of course).
	
Only open your Mac if you know what you’re doing. If you open the case 
and start fiddling around with its electronic insides, you might damage your 
Mac — and invalidate your Mac’s warranty.
Handling Startup Troubles
Sometimes you might press the power button to turn on your Mac and noth­
ing seems to happen. Other times, you might press the power button and 
see the usual Apple logo on the screen, and then nothing happens from that 
point on.
Before you rush your Mac to the emergency room of Mac repairs, do some 
simple troubleshooting yourself. At the very least, be sure to back up your 
important files — before you have any troubles — so you won’t lose them if 
you wind up sending your Mac to the repair shop.

220
Handling Startup Troubles
Booting up in Safe Mode
If you turn on your Mac and you can’t see the familiar Desktop, menu bar, 
and Dock, don’t panic. The first thing to do is try to boot up your Mac in 
what’s called Safe Mode, a boot sequence that loads the bare minimum of 
the Mac OS X operating system, just enough to get your computer running.
Many startup problems occur when nonessential programs, such as appoint­
ment reminders, automatically load at login time and wind up interfering 
with other startup programs, preventing your Mac from booting up cor­
rectly. Other startup programs load before you see the login screen or the 
Desktop (if you’ve set your Mac to automatically bypass the login window 
and go directly to the Desktop when it starts up). Booting up in Safe Mode 
cuts all the nonessential pre- and post-login programs out of the loop, so 
that only your core programs load. A successful boot in Safe Mode at least 
tells you that your Mac’s core system hasn’t been compromised.
By booting up your Mac in Safe Mode, you can remove any programs you 
recently installed, turn off any startup options you may have activated, and 
then restart to see whether that fixes the boot-up problems. If you remove 
recently installed programs and deactivate startup options and problems 
persist, copy any important files from your hard drive to a backup drive to 
protect your crucial data in case the hard drive is starting to fail (see Book II, 
Chapter 2).
To boot up in Safe Mode, turn on your Mac, then immediately hold down 
the Shift key until the Apple logo appears on the screen, indicating that your 
Mac is booting up.
	
Your Mac comes with a free utility program called Disk Utility, which can 
repair minor problems. Third-party utility programs, such as DiskWarrior 
(www.alsoft.com), are designed to repair major problems that Disk Utility 
can’t fix.
If the problem isn’t because of other programs trying to load when you turn 
on your Mac, you might have a more serious problem with your hard drive. 
A minor problem might involve scrambled data on your hard drive that you 
might be able to repair with a special utility diagnostic program, such as 
DiskWarrior (www.alsoft.com). A more serious problem could be physi­
cal damage to your hard drive. In that case, the only solution might be to 
replace the hard drive, and then restore your most recent Time Machine 
backup to the new hard drive so you’re back in business again as though 
nothing (or almost nothing) went kaput in the first place. 
	
To learn how to use Time Machine to back up your Mac’s hard drive, check 
out Book II, Chapter 2.

Handling Startup Troubles
Booting from a CD/DVD
If you can’t boot up from your hard drive, even in Safe Mode, and any utility 
program you run can’t fix the problem, you might have to boot from a CD 
or DVD. Use either the original Mac OS X Install disc that came with your 
Mac (or the disc containing a newer version of Mac OS X that you used to 
upgrade your Mac’s operating system) or a technical troubleshooting utility 
CD/DVD.
Every Mac comes with a DVD that contains the entire Mac OS X operating 
system. The purpose of this DVD is to let you run the Disk Utility program’s 
Repair Disk feature on your Mac’s primary hard drive, or to reinstall the 
operating system and return your Mac to its original condition when you 
first brought your computer home. You might want to reinstall the operating 
system for two reasons:
	
✦	 Your computer is so hopelessly fouled up it might be easier to wipe 
out everything and start from scratch rather than try to rescue the 
hard drive.
	
✦	 You plan on selling or giving your Mac away, and you want to wipe out 
your data and return the Mac to its original condition so someone else 
can personalize the Mac for himself.
	
Wiping out your hard drive and reinstalling the operating system from 
scratch will also wipe out any important files stored on your hard drive, 
so make sure you’re willing to accept this before reinstalling the operating 
system off a DVD. Ideally, you should have all your important files backed 
up on a separate external drive, such as an external hard drive or a CD/DVD, 
before wiping out your hard drive completely.
	
To learn how to back up your Mac’s hard drive using the Time Machine 
backup program that comes with every Mac, turn to Book II, Chapter 2.
The second type of CD/DVD you can boot from is a troubleshooting disc. 
Apple provides the free Disk Utility program on the original installation 
DVD that came with your Mac. However, you can buy a troubleshooting 
CD/DVD, such as DriveGenius (www.prosofteng.com), TechTool Pro 
(www.micromat.com), or DiskWarrior (www.alsoft.com). By running 
any of these programs directly from the CD/DVD, you can attempt to repair 
or resurrect any hard drive that fails to boot up on its own. Sometimes these 
troubleshooting CDs/DVDs can repair a hard drive, and sometimes they 
can’t. If you have important files trapped on your hard drive, this option 
might be your only hope of retrieving your files to back them up before 
sending or taking your Mac to a repair service to repair or replace your 
Mac’s hard drive.

222
Handling Startup Troubles
The type of CD/DVD you use depends on what you want to do. Start by boot­
ing up your Mac with the Mac OS X Install disc that came with your Mac and 
running the Disk Utility program. If that doesn’t work, try booting up with 
one of the technical troubleshooting CDs/DVDs described in the preceding 
paragraph to fix your hard drive. If you can’t fix your hard drive, you might 
have to resort to the more drastic step of wiping out your hard drive and 
reinstalling everything from the original Mac OS X CD/DVD.
No matter which CD/DVD you use, you still need to use it to boot your 
Mac instead of letting your Mac attempt to boot from its own hard drive. 
Here’s how:
	
1.	 Turn on your Mac.
	
2.	 Insert a CD/DVD into your Mac, and wait for your Mac to boot up to 
the Desktop if it can.
	
	 If your Mac gets stuck and cannot boot up to the Desktop, insert the 
CD/DVD while your Mac is still on, then hold down the Power button 
for 5 seconds until your Mac turns off, then turn it on again and skip to 
Step 4.
	
3.	 Choose Ú➪Restart.
	
4.	 After your Mac has shut down the Desktop and the screen goes blank, 
hold down the C key while your Mac restarts until you see the Apple 
logo, at which point you can release the C key.
	
	 This command tells your Mac to boot from the CD/DVD instead of the 
hard drive.
	
5.	 If you booted from a troubleshooting disc you purchased, follow the 
instructions on the screen.
	
6.	 If you booted from your Mac’s original OS X Install disc (or a newer 
OS X Install disc you purchased to upgrade your Mac), follow the steps 
in the “Running Disk Utility from DVD” section, later in this chapter, 
to attempt to repair your Mac’s hard drive.
	
7.	 If after trying Steps 5 or 6 you were unable to repair your Mac’s hard 
drive and your only choice is to reinstall your Mac’s operating system, 
follow the prompts displayed by the Mac OS X Restore CD/DVD to 
restore your Mac’s hard drive.
Booting from another Mac through a FireWire cable
An alternative to booting up from a CD or DVD, you can also boot up from 
another Mac connected to your computer through a FireWire cable. A 
FireWire cable simply plugs into the FireWire ports of each Mac, connect­
ing the two Macs together (providing, that is, your Mac has a FireWire port; 
some models don’t).

Book II 
Chapter 5
Maintenance and 
Troubleshooting
223
Shutting Down Frozen or Hung-Up Programs
After connecting two Macs through a FireWire cable, you boot up the work­
ing Mac normally and boot up the other Mac in FireWire Target Mode. This 
makes the second Mac’s hard drive appear as an external hard drive when 
viewed through the working Mac’s Finder.
By doing this, you can run a Disk Utility on the Target Mode Mac’s hard drive 
as described in the previous section, or you can run another hard drive utility 
program (such as Tech Tools Pro, DriveGenius, or DiskWarrior) on the work­
ing Mac to rescue the hard drive of the defective Mac. This is much like jump-
starting a car’s dead battery by using a second car with a good battery.
To boot up from a second Mac connected by a FireWire cable, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Connect the second Mac to your Mac using a FireWire cable.
	
2.	 Turn on the working Mac.
	
3.	 Turn on the Mac that’s having startup troubles and hold down the 
T key.
	
	 When the defective Mac’s hard drive appears as an external drive on 
the working Mac, you can copy your important files from the hard drive 
or run a utility program to fix the hard drive on the defective Mac. After 
copying files or repairing the hard drive, you need to disconnect the 
FireWire cable and restart both Macs.
Shutting Down Frozen or Hung-Up Programs
Programs that always run perfectly might suddenly stop working for no 
apparent reasons, and no matter which keys you press or where you click 
the mouse, nothing happens. Sometimes you might see a spinning cursor 
(affectionately referred to as the “spinning beach ball of death”), which stays 
onscreen and refuses to go away until you take steps to unlock the frozen 
program.
Sometimes being patient and waiting a few minutes results in the hung-up 
program resolving whatever was ailing it as though nothing was wrong in the 
first place. More often, however, the spinning cursor keeps spinning in an 
oh-so-annoying fashion. To end the torment, you need to force-quit the frozen 
or hung-up program — basically, you shut the program down so that the 
rest of your Mac can get back to work. To force-quit a program, choose one 
of the following methods:
	
✦	 Right-click the program’s icon on the Dock and choose Force Quit from 
the menu that appears. (If Force Quit doesn’t appear on the shortcut 
menu, hold down the Option key and Control-click the program icon in 
the Dock again.)

224
Shutting Down Frozen or Hung-Up Programs
	
✦	 Choose Ú➪Force Quit to display the Force Quit Applications dialog, as 
shown in Figure 5-1. Then select the name of the hung-up program and 
click the Force Quit button.
	
✦	 Press Option+Ô+Esc to display the Force Quit Applications dialog (see 
Figure 6-1). Then select the name of the hung-up program and click the 
Force Quit button.
	
✦	 Load the Activity Monitor program (located inside the Utilities folder 
in the Applications folder), select the process name, as shown in Figure 
5-2, and then choose View➪Quit Process. A Quit Process dialog appears. 
Click Force Quit.

Besides using the methods in the preceding list, you can also use the 
Terminal program to force-quit a program. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	 Load the Terminal program (located in the Utilities folder inside the 
Applications folder).
	
	 The Terminal window appears, as shown in Figure 5-3.

as shown in Figure 5-4.
	
Figure 5-4: 
The Terminal 
window

information 
about every

3.	 Under the COMMAND column, look for the name of the program you 
want to force-quit.
	
	 Sometimes only an abbreviated form of the complete program name 
appears, rather than the full name.
	
4.	 In the PID (Process ID) column, find the number that appears to the 
left of the program name; write this PID number down.

Removing Jammed CDs/DVDs
	
5.	 Type q.
	
	 The Terminal window removes the list of running programs and waits 
for your next command, as shown in Figure 5-5.
	
6.	 Type kill ### and press Return, where ### is the PID number of the 
program you wrote down from Step 4.
	
	 This force-quits your chosen program.
	
	 If you can’t kill a program using the normal kill ### command, try 
kill -9 ###, where ### represents the PID number of the program 
you want to kill. This -9 option can usually kill programs that the ordi­
nary kill command can’t.
	
7.	 Choose Terminal➪Quit Terminal.

Removing Jammed CDs/DVDs
If a CD/DVD gets jammed in your Mac’s CD/DVD drive, you can try one (or 
more) of the following methods to eject the stuck disc:
	
✦	 Press the Eject key on your keyboard.
	
✦	 Drag the CD/DVD icon on the Desktop to the Trash icon in the Dock. (The 
trash icon turns into an Eject icon, to let you know your Mac wants to 
eject the disc but does not intend to delete the information on the disc.)
	
✦	 Choose Ú➪Restart, and hold down the mouse or trackpad button while 
your Mac boots up.
	
✦	 Click the Eject button next to the CD/DVD icon in the Sidebar of a Finder 
window (click the Mac-faced Finder icon in the Dock to open a new 
Finder window).
	
✦	 Click the Eject button next to the CD/DVD icon in iTunes.
	
✦	 Choose Controls➪Eject DVD from inside the DVD Player program.
	
✦	 Load the Disk Utility program (located in the Utilities folder inside the 
Applications folder), click the CD/DVD icon, and click the Eject icon.

✦	 Click to select the CD/DVD icon on the Desktop and choose File➪Eject 
from the main menu.
	
✦	 Click to select the CD/DVD icon on the Desktop and press Ô+E.
	
✦	 Control-click the CD/DVD icon on the Desktop and choose Eject from the 
menu that appears.
	
Although it might be tempting, don’t jam tweezers, a flathead screwdriver, 
or any other object inside your CD/DVD drive to pry out a jammed disc. Not 
only can this scratch the disc surface, but also it can physically damage the 
CD/DVD drive.
	
Prevention is the best medicine, so I include here a few pointers on how to 
avoid getting discs jammed in the drive in the first place:
	
✦	 Do not use mini CDs/DVDs in slot-loading drives.
	
✦	 Be careful of using hand-applied labels on discs you put in the drive. 
These can easily jam or make the disc too thick to eject properly.
	
✦	 If your Mac’s disc drive is repeatedly acting strange or not working prop­
erly when you try to play a music CD or watch a DVD, it’s possible your 
disc drive is on its last leg and it might need repairs. Stop using the drive 
and take or send your Mac to Apple or an authorized service provider 
for a checkup.
Repairing and Maintaining Hard Drives
Hard drives can fail in for a number of reasons. In some cases, the data could 
be scrambled on the hard drive, confusing your Mac and making it impossible 
to read data from it. If data is scrambled, you can often reorganize your data 
(using a disk utility program) to get your hard drive back in working condition.
Another reason hard disks can fail is if the surface of your hard drive 
becomes damaged. If this occurs, your only option is to copy critical files 
from the damaged hard drive (if possible) and replace it with a new one. If 
you run a disk utility program and it fails to repair any problems on your 
hard drive, this might be a sign that your hard drive surface is physically 
damaged.
	
The Disk Utility program that comes free with every Mac — tucked away in 
the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder — can examine your hard 
drive. However, to fix any problems it might find, you have to boot your Mac 
from a different hard drive or from the Mac OS X Install DVD that came with 
your Mac.

228
Repairing and Maintaining Hard Drives
In the following sections, I show you the tools for figuring out which problem 
you have and what to do to fix it.
Verifying a disk
If you suspect that your hard drive might be scrambled or physically dam­
aged, you can run the Disk Utility program to verify your suspicions. When 
using Disk Utility, select a device and choose one of the following:
	
✦	 Verify Disk: Checks to make sure all the files on that device are neatly 
organized.
	
✦	 Verify Disk Permissions: Checks to make sure relevant files, installed 
with each program, maintain the permissions originally assigned. 
(Permissions apply only to your startup disk.)
	
The Disk Utility program can verify and repair all types of storage devices 
(except optical discs like CDs and DVDs), including hard drives, flash drives, 
and other types of removable storage media, such as compact flash cards.
To verify a disk, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Load the Disk Utility program (stored inside the Utilities folder in the 
Applications folder).
	
	 The Disk Utility window appears.
	
2.	 Click the device (hard drive, flash drive, and so on) that you want to 
verify in the left pane of the Disk Utility window. (See Figure 5-6.)
	
3.	 Make sure the First Aid pane is visible. (If not, click the First Aid tab to 
call it up.)
	
4.	 Click the Verify Disk button.
	
	 The Disk Utility program examines your chosen device. If Disk Utility 
can’t verify that a device is working, you see a message informing you 
that First Aid feature of Disk Utility has failed, as shown in Figure 5-7.
	
5.	 Click OK and then click the Repair Disk button.
	
	 You can do this step only with a non-startup disk — to repair your Mac’s 
startup disk, skip ahead to the next set of steps.
	
	 Disk Utility tries to fix your device. If it succeeds, you see a message 
informing you that the device is repaired.

Repairing and Maintaining Hard Drives
	
You can verify your hard drive to identify any problems, but you cannot 
repair your startup hard drive using the copy of Disk Utility stored on your 
startup hard drive. To repair your startup hard drive, you need to follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Insert your Mac OS X Install disc that came with your Mac if you’re 
still running that version of Mac OS X.
	
	 If you’ve since upgraded your Mac to a newer version of Mac OS X, 
insert the newer Mac OS X Install disc.
	
	 The Mac OS X installation disc contains the Disk Utility program to help 
you troubleshoot your startup hard drive.
	
2.	 Restart your Mac by choosing Ú➪Restart.
	
	 The Restart dialog appears.
	
3.	 Click Restart to restart your Mac. 
	
4.	 Hold down the C key while your Mac restarts. 
	
	 You can release the C key when your Mac boots up and you see the 
Apple logo appear on the screen.
	
	 This boots your Mac from the Mac OS X Install disc. Your Mac starts 
its Mac OS X installation program and displays a list of languages to 
choose.
	
	 Booting and running off your install disc can be slow, so be patient.
	
5.	 Select the language you want to use and click the arrow button in the 
bottom-right corner of the window.
	
	 An OS X Installer Welcome window appears.
	
6.	 Click the Utilities menu and choose Disk Utility.
	
	 The Disk Utility window appears.
	
7.	 Click the Macintosh HD startup drive (or whatever your Mac’s primary 
hard drive is named if you renamed it) in the left pane of the Disk 
Utility window.

10.	 Choose Disk Utility➪Quit Disk Utility.
	
	 The Mac OS X Installer Welcome window appears again.
	
11.	 Click the Mac OS X Installer menu, choose Quit Mac OS X Installer, 
and then click the Restart button to restart your Mac.
	
12.	 Hold down the Eject button while your Mac restarts to eject the Mac 
OS X Install disc.
	
	 If your Mac starts up normally and presents you with the Desktop, then 
Disk Utility managed to repair your Mac’s hard drive successfully. Phew, 
crisis averted!
Verifying disk permissions
Disk permissions apply to your startup disk and define what each program’s 
files are allowed to access and which users have access to which files. If 
permissions aren’t correct, your files could become scrambled, which can 
cause your Mac to act erratically or prevent a program from launching.
	
Unlike repairing a hard drive, you can verify and fix disk permissions with­
out having to boot up from a separate hard drive or CD/DVD.
To verify disk permissions, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Load the Disk Utility program (stored inside the Utilities folder in the 
Applications folder).
	
	 The Disk Utility window appears.
	
2.	 Click your Macintosh HD (or whatever you renamed your Mac’s hard 
drive if you changed the name) in the left pane of the Disk Utility window.
	
3.	 Make sure the window is on the First Aid pane. (If not, click the First 
Aid tab to call it up.)
	
4.	 Click Verify Disk Permissions.
	
	 If Disk Utility finds any problems, it displays a message to let you know. 
Otherwise, it displays a message to let you know all permissions are 
okay, as shown in Figure 5-8.
	
5.	 Click Repair Disk Permissions.
	
	 Disk Utility displays any messages concerning permission problems it 
found and repaired.
	
6.	 Choose Disk Utility➪Quit Disk Utility.

Preventative Maintenance
Your Mac has daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance tasks that it runs 
periodically early in the morning if you leave your Mac on at night. However, 
if your Mac is asleep during this time, it won’t run these maintenance tasks. 
You can wake yourself up before dawn every day and wake your Mac so it 
can run its maintenance tasks, or you can force your Mac to run its daily, 
weekly, and monthly maintenance tasks.
	
To automate running your Mac preventative maintenance programs, consider 
getting a free program called MainMenu (http://www.santasw.com/).
To force your Mac to run its maintenance tasks, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Load the Terminal program (located in the Utilities folder inside the 
Applications folder).
	
	 The Terminal window appears (refer to Figure 5-3).
	
2.	 Type sudo periodic daily and then press Return.
	
	 The Terminal window asks for your password.

In This Chapter
✓	Understanding audio file formats
✓	Playing audio files with iTunes
✓	Burning audio files to disc
L
ugging around a case full of CDs (or even vinyl records or audio tapes) 
is cumbersome and bulky; which is why (since the advent of the origi­
nal iPod) most people store music as digital audio files. Not only are digital 
audio files much easier to store and copy, storing individual songs as digital 
audio files means you need to carry only the songs you want to hear. 
Besides storing music, audio files can also contain spoken-words content, 
such as speeches, interviews, magazine and newspaper articles, and radio 
shows. Many audio files that contain interviews or entire radio shows are 
called podcasts because they’re commonly played on iPods.
Understanding Audio File Compression Formats
Audio files offer tremendous advantages in storage and audio quality com­
pared to previous forms of audio storage. However, dozens of different 
audio file compression types — the underlying conversion technology used 
to save audio as digital files — are out there. Therefore, to hear different 
audio files, you might need to use different programs. This would be like 
having to buy two separate radios where one radio receives only AM sta­
tions and the second radio receives only FM stations.
Different types of audio file compression formats exist because each file 
format offers certain advantages. The three most popular types of audio file 
compression schemes used for saving audio as digital files are lossless, loss­
less compression, and lossy compression.
	
Any audio file format can play on your Mac as long as you install the right 
software.

238
Understanding Audio File Compression Formats
Lossless audio files
The highest-quality audio files are called lossless because they never lose 
any audio data. As a result, lossless audio files offer the highest-quality 
sound, but they also create the largest file sizes.
The two most popular lossless audio file formats are WAV (Waveform audio 
format) and AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format). WAV files typically end 
with the .wav file extension; whereas AIFF files typically end with the .aiff 
or .aif file extension. 
Compressed lossless audio files
Lossless audio files take up large amounts of space, so compressed lossless 
audio files are designed to squeeze audio data into a smaller file size. Three 
popular compressed lossless audio file formats are FLAC (Free Lossless 
Audio Codec), Shorten, and Apple Lossless. FLAC files typically end with the 
.flac file extension, Shorten files typically end with the .shn file extension, 
and Apple Lossless files typically end with the .m4a file extension.
	
You can play Apple Lossless files in iTunes, but not FLAC or Shorten audio 
files. To play FLAC files, grab a free copy of SongBird (www.songbirdnest.
com) or VLC Media Player (www.videolan.org/vlc). To play Shorten files, 
use Audion (www.panic.com/audion).
Compressed lossy audio files
A lossy audio file compresses audio files by stripping certain audio data to 
shrink the file size, much like pulling unnecessary clothing from a suitcase 
to lighten the load. The greater the audio quality, the more audio data the 
file needs to retain and the bigger the file. The smaller the file, the less audio 
data the file can hold, and the lower the audio quality. As a result, most 
audio file formats strive for an optimal balance between audio quality and 
file size. 
The amount of data an audio file format retains is measured in kilobits per 
second (Kbps). The higher the kilobits, the more data stored and the higher 
the audio quality. Table 1-1 shows approximate kilobit values and the audio 
quality they produce.

Audio Quality
192 Kbps
Medium quality, slight differences from the 
original audio source can be heard
224–320 Kbps
High quality, little loss of audio quality from 
the original source
The most popular compressed lossy audio file formats are MP3 (MPEG-1 
Audio Layer 3), AAC (Advanced Audio Coding), and WMA (Windows Media 
Audio). MP3 audio files are the most popular because the MP3 audio file 
standard was one of the first compression file formats that could compress 
audio files to a smaller size and retain much of their audio quality. You can 
recognize MP3 audio files by their .mp3 file extension.
Because the MP3 audio file format is copyrighted, programmers have cre­
ated a free equivalent audio file format called Ogg Vorbis, which uses the 
.ogg file extension. Ogg Vorbis offers slightly higher audio quality and 
slightly greater compression ratios. 
Another alternative to MP3 files is the AAC audio file format. Similar to Ogg 
Vorbis, AAC audio files offer greater audio quality and smaller file compres­
sion than equivalent MP3 files. Unlike the Ogg Vorbis format, the AAC format 
offers a digital rights management (DRM) feature that allows copy protec­
tion. AAC files typically end with the .aac or .m4a file extension (if it does 
not have DRM) or the .m4p file extension (if it does have DRM).
	
To play Ogg Vorbis files, you can use VLC Media Player, which you can 
download free at www.videolan.org/vlc.
Except for sound effects or mobile phone ring­
tones, most audio files are 2 to 4 megabytes in 
size. Before you can play such an audio file, 
you must first copy the entire file to your Mac. 
Normally, this isn’t a problem except if you 
want to listen to audio right away, such as a live 
radio broadcast on a radio station’s Web site, or 
a recording of a speech given by the President 
of the United States on a news Web site. These 
kinds of audio files are called streaming audio.
Two features distinguish streaming audio from 
ordinary audio files. First, streaming audio plays 
while it’s being downloaded — or streamed — 
to your Mac. Second, streaming audio is not 
typically saved to your hard drive.
The iTunes program (included with every Mac) 
can play streaming audio. Some other popular 
(and free) programs for listening to streaming 
audio include Audion (www.panic.com/
audion), RealPlayer (www.real.com), and 
AOL Radio (http://music.aol.com/
radioguide/bb).

Playing Audio with iTunes
Playing Audio with iTunes
You can buy audio files of your favorite songs from such services as the 
iTunes Store or from Amazon.com. Perhaps the most popular way to get 
audio files is by importing (also known as ripping) songs from an audio CD 
and storing them as audio files on your hard drive.
When you have an audio file, you need a special program that can play that 
audio file. To play the three most common audio files (MP3, AAC, and AIFF) 
on your Mac, you can use iTunes. The iTunes program is a combination audio 
and video player, audio file converter, and disc-burning program. Using the 
iTunes disc-burning feature, you can copy your favorite audio files to a CD 
that you can play in your home CD player or on the CD player in your car.
	
You don’t have to use iTunes to play audio CDs and digital audio files on your 
Mac. You can always use another audio player on your Mac (such as RealPlayer, 
which you can get free at www.real.com, VLC Media Player at www.videolan.
org/vlc, or Audion at www.panic.com/audion). Other audio players can be 
especially useful if you want to play oddball audio formats like Ogg Vorbis or 
FLAC, but in most cases, you’ll probably find that iTunes works just fine.
Listening to CDs
You probably have audio CDs of your favorite albums, but rather than play 
them in a CD player, you can play them in your Mac by using iTunes. Much 
like a CD player, iTunes can play audio tracks on a CD in order or randomly. 
Even better, iTunes lets you selectively choose which audio tracks you want 
to hear. To play an audio CD in iTunes, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the iTunes icon in the Dock to launch iTunes if it isn’t already 
running (or double-click the iTunes icon in the Applications folder).
	
2.	 Insert an audio CD into your Mac.
	
	 A dialog appears, asking whether you want to import all audio tracks on 
the CD into iTunes. I discuss this process in the next section. For now, 
proceed to Step 3.
	
3.	 Click No.
	
	 If you’re connected to the Internet, iTunes searches an Internet Website 
called GraceNotes for information about the CD you inserted, based on 
multiple criteria, including the number and length of tracks on the CD. If 
GraceNotes finds a match for your CD, iTunes displays that information, 
which can include the album name and artist, track titles, and, if avail­
able, the album’s cover artwork, as shown in Figure 1-1.
	
4.	 Click the Play button or press the spacebar to start playing your 
selected audio tracks. 
	
	 The Play button turns into a Pause button (which you can click to pause 
the track you’re listening to).

Figure 1-1: 
You can see 
all the audio 
tracks on 
your CD by 
name and 
track length.
	
Here are some tricks you can use to enhance your CD-listening experience:
	
✦	 Volume slider: Drag the volume slider to adjust the sound. 
	
✦	 Selective play: Deselect the check boxes of any audio tracks you don’t 
want to hear.
	
✦	 Random play: Choose Controls➪Shuffle to play your audio tracks in 
random order. Choosing the Shuffle command again turns off random 
play. You can keep toggling this command off and on until you see a 
random order that you like.
	
✦	 Repeat-selection play: Choose Controls➪Repeat➪All to play the selected 
audio tracks continuously on the CD. (Choose Controls➪Repeat Off to 
turn off the repeat play feature.)
	
	 If you select an audio track and then choose Controls➪Repeat One, you 
can play a single audio track over and over.
	
✦	 Adjust play: Click one of the following buttons:
 
• Pause: Temporarily stops playing audio. You can also press the 
spacebar to toggle the Play and Pause button.
 
• Previous: Starts playing the selected audio track from the beginning. 
Clicking the Previous button a second time starts playing the previ­
ous audio track from the beginning.
 
• Next: Skips the selected audio track and starts playing the next audio 
track.

When you’re listening to an audio CD, you can eject it by choosing Controls➪
Eject Disc (or by clicking the Eject Disc icon to the right of the CD icon).
Importing a CD’s audio tracks into iTunes
Having to insert a CD into your Mac every time you want to hear a few songs 
can be cumbersome, which is why you might find it easier to store your 
favorite songs as digital audio files instead.
	
The process of converting audio tracks on a CD into digital audio files is 
known as ripping.
To convert an audio disc into digital files, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the iTunes icon in the Dock to launch iTunes if it isn’t already 
running (or double-click the iTunes icon in the Applications folder).
	
2.	 Insert an audio CD into your Mac. 
	
	 A dialog appears, asking if you want to import all audio tracks on the CD 
into iTunes, as shown in Figure 1-2.
	
Figure 1-2: 
When you 
insert a 
CD, iTunes 
offers to 
copy its 
contents to 
your Mac’s 
hard drive.
	
	
3.	 Click Yes if you want to convert every audio track into a digital 
audio file. 
	
	 The iTunes program copies and converts all of the CD’s audio tracks 
into digital audio files and saves them to your Mac’s hard drive in the 
Music folder. Skip to Step 5.
	
4.	 If you want to choose which files to select, click No, and uncheck the 
check boxes of the tracks you don’t want to import. 
	
	 Check marks should appear in the check boxes of the audio tracks you 
want to import.

5.	 Click the Import CD button in the lower-right corner of the iTunes 
window. 
	
	 iTunes imports your CD’s audio tracks into the iTunes library one at a 
time until all tracks have been copied to your Mac’s hard drive.
	
6.	 When iTunes finishes importing your CD’s audio tracks, eject the CD 
by choosing Controls➪Eject Disc (or by clicking the Eject Disc icon to 
the right of the CD icon).
Adjusting CD importing options and other settings
Choosing how iTunes should respond when you insert a CD, what type 
of audio file format it uses to import your CD audio tracks, and which 
Library categories you want to display in the left-hand column of the iTunes 
program window are all options you can adjust by accessing the iTunes 
Preferences dialog. To open the iTunes’s Preferences dialog and adjust the 
program’s settings, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose iTunes➪Preferences.
	
	 The iTunes Preferences window appears.
	
2.	 Click the General icon (if it isn’t already selected) to display the 
General settings pane, as shown in Figure 1-3.
	
Figure 1-3: 
The iTunes

an audio CD into your Mac, click the When You Insert a CD pop-up 
menu and choose one of the following:
 
• Show CD: Displays a list of audio tracks.
 
• Begin Playing: Displays a list of audio tracks and starts playing the 
first track.
 
• Ask to Import CD: Displays a dialog, asking whether you want to 
import all audio tracks from the CD (this is the default setting).
 
• Import CD: Automatically converts all audio tracks into digital files.
 
• Import CD and Eject: Automatically converts all audio tracks into digi­
tal files and ejects the CD when it finishes without playing any tracks.
	
4.	 (Optional) Click Automatically Retrieve CD Track Names from Internet 
if you want iTunes to identify audio tracks by their song titles. If this 
option isn’t selected, each audio track will have a generic name like 
Track 1.
	
5.	 (Optional) To specify the file format and audio quality of the audio 
files iTunes will create when importing CD audio tracks, click the 
Import Settings button.
	
	 The Import Settings preferences pane, shown in Figure 1-4, opens.

	 You return to the main iTunes program window.
Importing digital audio files
Besides ripping audio tracks from a CD and storing them on your Mac, you 
might also get digital audio files through the Internet or handed to you on a 
flash drive or external hard drive. Before you can play any digital audio files 
in iTunes, you must first import those files, which essentially copies them 
into the iTunes folder inside your Music folder. 
To import audio files into iTunes, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the iTunes icon in the Dock to run iTunes if it isn’t already run­
ning (or double-click the iTunes icon in the Applications folder).
	
2.	 Choose File➪Add to Library to open the Add to Library dialog, as 
shown in Figure 1-5.
	
3.	 Navigate to the folder, audio file, or files you want to import into 
iTunes, click your selections, and then click the Choose button.
	
	 iTunes imports the folder, audio file, or files into your Music folder.

Sorting your digital audio files
After you store some digital audio files in iTunes, you can sort through them 
to find the audio files you want. The iTunes program offers three ways to 
display your audio files:
	
✦	 List view: Displays audio files alphabetically by category, such as name, 
album, artist, or genre. Optionally, you can choose View➪Show Artwork 
Column to display an album’s cover artwork alongside listed audio files.
	
✦	 Grid view: Displays album cover artwork of audio files grouped alpha­
betically by album name.
	
✦	 Cover Flow view: Displays album covers as 3-D images in upper pane 
and album details in lower pane.
	
To customize the way your List view displays your iTunes music collection, 
choose View➪Column Browser and then check or uncheck any columns you 
want to see in the List view. Choose On Top or On Left to choose how the 
columns you’ve selected appear — above the music tracks pane, or to the 
left of the music tracks pane (see Figure 1-6).
Displaying audio files in List view
The List view is best suited for when you want to see as many names of your 
audio files as possible. In the List view, you can view your audio files alpha­
betically sorted by different categories, such as Artist or Album. To see the 
List view, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In iTunes, choose View➪As List (or click the List View icon) to display 
the List view, as shown in Figure 1-6.

Figure 1-6: 
The List 
view lets 
you arrange 
your audio  
files alpha- 
betically by 
categories, 
such as 
Name or 
Artist.
	
	
2.	 Click a category heading, such as Name or Artist. 
	
	 When you click a category heading, iTunes sorts your entire audio 
library alphabetically in ascending order based on that category. If you 
click the same category again, iTunes sorts your audio files alphabeti­
cally in descending order.
	
	 Optionally, you can choose View➪Show Artwork Column to display an 
album’s cover artwork alongside listed audio files.
	
The List view makes it easy to find audio files for a particular artist. 
Displaying audio files in Grid view
The Grid view visually groups songs by album cover artwork. If cover art­
work is not available for an album, the Grid view displays a musical note 
icon. If you find the List view too boring because it displays only text, try the 
Grid view instead. To see the Grid view, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In iTunes, choose View➪As Grid (or click the Grid View icon) to dis­
play the Grid view, as shown in Figure 1-7.
	
2.	 Click the Albums, Artists, Genres, or Composers buttons to sort the 
Grid view based on those categories.

Displaying audio files in Cover Flow view
Another way to sort through your audio file collection is with the Cover 
Flow view, which mimics the appearance of displaying album covers in a 
jukebox, where you can flip through different album covers to find the songs 
you want to play. Like the Grid view, the Cover Flow view lets you browse 
through your favorite songs sorted by album cover artwork. 
	
To download album cover artwork, you need an iTunes account. If you have 
an iTunes account, choose Store➪Sign In to sign in to your iTunes account. 
To create an iTunes account, choose Store➪Create Account. Creating an 
account won’t cost you anything, but you will need to enter a credit card 
number in case you decide to buy anything from the iTunes online store.
To see the Cover Flow view, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In iTunes, choose View➪Cover Flow View (or click the Cover Flow 
View icon) to display the Cover Flow view, as shown in Figure 1-8.
	
2.	 Click an album cover to see the songs associated with that album.
	
	 Optionally, you can click the Full Screen icon located next to the right-
hand scrollbar arrow to make the Cover Flow view fill the entire screen.

Playing digital audio files
After you import one or more audio files into iTunes, you can view your list 
of audio files within the iTunes window, as outlined in the previous section. 
To play one or more digital files, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose a view for displaying your audio file collection, such as List, 
Grid, or Cover Flow view.
	
	 Check marks appear in the check boxes of selected songs.
	
2.	 Select the check boxes of the audio tracks you want to hear and dese­
lect the check boxes of audio tracks you don’t want to hear. 
	
	 To deselect all audio tracks so you don’t have to listen to them, hold 
down the Ô key and select a check box. To reselect all audio tracks, 
repeat the process.
	
3.	 Click the Play button or press the spacebar to start playing your 
selected audio tracks.
	
	 The Play button turns into a Pause button.

To help you find a song, you can search by typing some or all of its name, 
album, artist, and so on. To search for a song, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Search field in the upper-right corner of the iTunes window 
and type part of the song, album, or other item that you want to find. 
	
	 Each time you type a letter in the Search field, iTunes narrows the list of 
available songs in your music collection, as shown in Figure 1-9.
	
2.	 Click the Close button of the Search field when you find the song you 
want. 
Using an iTunes Playlist
Rather than go through the hassle of selecting the same group of songs over 
and over, you can select a group of songs once and store that list as a play-
list. When you want to hear the group of songs, just select the playlist rather 
than each song.

Using an iTunes Playlist
You can create two types of playlists: an ordinary playlist or a Smart Playlist. 
An ordinary playlist is a list of favorite songs you select to include in that play-
list. A Smart Playlist lets you define rules for which songs to include, such as 
only songs recorded by a specific artist. While your audio file collection grows, 
a Smart Playlist can automatically include any new songs by that specific artist 
or by whatever other criteria you define for the particular Smart Playlist.
When you create an ordinary playlist or a Smart Playlist, those playlists 
appear in the source pane of the iTunes window. By default, iTunes already 
includes several Smart Playlists, including Recently Added, Recently Played, 
and Top 25 Most Played.
Creating a playlist
The simplest playlist to create is one that contains specific songs, such as a 
favorite album, a group of songs you want to listen to when you go for a run 
or workout, or perhaps every song by a particular artist. To create a playlist 
of particular songs you want to group, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In iTunes, hold down the Ô key and click each song you want to store 
in your playlist.
	
2.	 Choose File➪New Playlist from Selection. 
	
	 An untitled playlist appears in the source pane of iTunes under the 
Playlists category, and your chosen songs appear in the right pane.
	
3.	 Type a name for your playlist and press Return.
	
You can always edit a playlist name by double-clicking the name in the 
source pane.
Adding songs to a playlist
After you create a playlist, you can add or remove songs to that playlist at 
any time. To add a song to a playlist, click a song you want to add and drag it 
to the playlist in the source pane of the iTunes window. The song you added 
appears in the playlist.
	
Putting a song in a playlist doesn’t physically move the song from the folder 
it’s stored in on your Mac’s hard drive.
Deleting songs from a playlist
To delete a song from a playlist, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In iTunes, click the playlist that contains the songs you want to delete 
to display the songs in your chosen playlist.

252
Using an iTunes Playlist
	
2.	 Click a song to delete and then press the Delete key. 
	
	 A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to remove the song 
from your playlist.
	
3.	 Click Remove.
	
Deleting a song from a playlist doesn’t delete the song from your iTunes 
library. 
	
To delete a song from your music collection, click Music under the Library 
category in the source pane of the iTunes window, click a song you want 
to delete, and then press the Delete key. When a dialog appears, asking 
whether you want to delete the song from your Library, click Remove. When 
a second dialog appears, click Move to Trash if you want to delete the song 
track from your Mac’s hard drive. Click Keep File if you want to keep the 
song track on your Mac’s hard drive but no longer display it in your iTunes 
music library.
Creating a Smart Playlist
Manually adding and removing songs from a playlist can get tedious, espe­
cially if you regularly add new songs to your iTunes audio collection. Instead 
of placing specific songs in a playlist, a Smart Playlist lets you define spe­
cific criteria for what types of songs to store in that playlist, such as songs 
recorded earlier than 1990 or songs under a particular genre, such as Blues, 
Country, Hard Rock, or Folk. To create and use a Smart Playlist, you tag 
songs, define rules to determine which songs to include, and finally, edit 
existing playlists.
Tagging songs
To sort your song collection accurately into Smart Playlists, you can tag 
individual songs with descriptive information. Most songs stored as digital 
audio files already have some information stored in specific tags, such as the 
artist or album name. However, you might still want to edit or add new tags 
to help Smart Playlists sort your song collection.
To edit or add tags to a song, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In iTunes, click a song that you want to tag and then choose File➪Get 
Info (or press Ô+I) to display the song track’s information.
	
2.	 Click the Info tab to display text boxes where you can type in or 
change the song track’s associated information, as shown in 
Figure 1-10.
	
3.	 Click a text field and edit or type new information.
	
4.	 In the same Info pane, click the Genre pop-up menu to add or change 
the song’s genre.

Defining a Smart Playlist rule
Smart Playlists use tags to sort and organize your song collection. You can use 
existing tags that are created for songs automatically (such as Artist and Album) 
as well as tags that you add to your songs to define the type of songs you want 
that Smart Playlist to store. A specific criterion for choosing a song is a rule.
To create a Smart Playlist, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In iTunes, choose File➪New Smart Playlist.
	
	 A Smart Playlist dialog appears, prompting you to define a rule for speci­
fying which songs to store in the playlist, as shown in Figure 1-12.
	
Figure 1-12: 
The Smart 
Playlist 
dialog lets 
you define 
a rule for 
automatically 
choosing 
certain 
songs.
	
	
2.	 Click the first pop-up menu on the left and choose a category, such as 
Artist or Date Added, for deciding which songs the Smart Playlist will 
automatically choose, as shown in Figure 1-13.
	
3.	 Click the second pop-up menu in the middle and choose how to use 
your chosen category, as shown in Figure 1-14.
	
4.	 Click the text box and type a criteria, such as a specific date or an 
artist name.
	
5.	 (Optional) Make other selections in the Smart Playlist dialog:
	
• Limit To: Select this option and enter a number to define the maxi­
mum number of (choose one) songs/file size/minutes/hours/items 
the Smart Playlist can hold; then choose an option (that suits your 
desired Smart Playlist criteria) in the Selected By pop-up menu.
	
• Match Only Checked Items: If you want to store only songs that both 
match your criteria and are selected with checkmarks in the iTunes 
window, select this option.
	
• Live Updating: Select this option if you don’t want the Smart Playlist 
to update its list of songs automatically each time you add or remove 
a song from your iTunes song collection library.

1.	 In iTunes, click a playlist that you want to delete in the source pane of 
the iTunes window and then press the Delete key.
	
	 A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to delete your playlist.
	
	 Deleting a playlist doesn’t physically delete the audio files from your 
iTunes library.
	
2.	 Click the Delete button.
Burning an Audio CD
After you add your favorite songs to your iTunes music library, you can 
copy music tracks to a custom CD (often called a mix CD or just a mix) that 
you can play in your car or home stereo. To burn an audio CD, you first 
create a playlist and then instruct iTunes to copy all the songs in the playlist 
to an audio CD.
	
CDs can hold approximately 70–80 minutes of audio. More stereos can recog­
nize and play CD-Rs although newer stereos can recognize and play CD-RWs 
as well. (CD-Rs let you write to them only once; whereas CD-RWs allow you 
to erase and reuse them.)
To burn a disc using a playlist, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Playlist you want to burn to CD.
	
2.	 (Optional) Deselect the check boxes of any songs you don’t want to 
burn to the CD.
	
3.	 (Optional) Arrange the songs in the order you want them to play on 
the CD.
	
	 To arrange songs in a playlist, click in the first column (that displays 
the number of each song) and then drag a song up or down to a new 
position.

✓	Capturing pictures
✓	Finding image-editing programs
M
ore people are taking pictures than ever before with digital cameras 
and mobile phones. Both gadgets let you capture a picture, see it 
right away, and then decide whether you want to keep it. Even better, after 
you capture a picture, you can edit it to make it look better than the subject 
or scene did in real life. You can even alter a digital image with an image-
editing program. You can use iPhoto, which is part of the iLife suite, for 
image editing, but many other programs are available, and I discuss them 
briefly here. 
Understanding Digital Photography
Instead of using film, digital photography captures images on memory stor­
age devices. Not only does this make storing digital photographs easy on your 
Mac, you can also make identical copies of your pictures at any time with­
out losing the quality of your images. When using a digital camera or mobile 
phone equipped with a camera, it’s helpful to understand how digital cam­
eras and mobile phones store images so you can transfer them to your Mac.
Megapixels
Digital photographs capture images as a collection of tiny dots called pixels. 
A single picture consists of hundreds, thousands, or (more commonly) mil­
lions of pixels. The greater the number of pixels used to create a picture, the 
sharper the overall image. To help you understand the capabilities of differ­
ent digital cameras and mobile phones, manufacturers identify the gadgets 
by how many millions of pixels they can capture in each picture. This total 
number of pixels, called the resolution, ranges from as little as less than 
one megapixel (MP) to 16 megapixels or more. Figure 2-1 shows how pixels 
create an image.

260
Understanding Digital Photography
	
Figure 2-1: 
Every digital 
image 
consists of 
hundreds, 
thousands, 
or millions 
of pixels.
	
	
The higher the megapixels of a digital camera, the sharper the image resolu­
tion. A picture captured with a 2-megapixel camera may not look as sharp 
as that same image captured with an 8-megapixel camera, especially if you 
enlarge it. 
Flash memory cards
Every time you snap a digital picture, your camera or mobile phone needs 
to save that picture somewhere. Some digital cameras and mobile phones 
(such as the Palm Pre and Apple iPhone) come with built-in memory, which 
can temporarily store any digital images that you capture. However, to store 
large numbers of pictures, most digital cameras and some mobile phones 
can also store pictures on removable storage devices called flash memory 
cards.
Okay, in no particular order, here are a few things to keep in mind about 
flash memory cards:
	
✦	 Reuse: The biggest advantage of flash memory cards over film is that 
you can erase and reuse flash memory cards. You can take as many 
pictures as the flash memory card can hold, copy your pictures to your 
Mac’s hard drive, and then erase the pictures from the flash memory 
card so you can use it again.

Book III
Chapter 2
Importing, Viewing, 
and Organizing 
Photos
261
Understanding Digital Photography
	
✦	 Resolution versus storage: The number of pictures you can store on 
flash memory cards depends on the resolution of the pictures you take. 
If you capture pictures at a high resolution, you can store far fewer pic­
tures than if you capture those same pictures at a lower resolution. 
	
✦	 Storage and speed measurement: Flash memory cards are often mea­
sured in terms of their storage size and speed. The amount of storage a 
flash memory card can hold is measured in megabytes (MB) and giga­
bytes (GB), such as 512MB or 2GB. The greater the storage capability of 
a flash memory card, the higher the cost.
	
	 The speed of flash memory cards is often described as minimum read 
and write speeds, measured in megabytes per second (MB/sec) such 
as 10MB/sec. The higher the write speed of a flash memory card, the 
faster you can capture and store pictures. Sometimes the speed of a 
flash memory card might also be described as a number — 60x, for 
example — which tells you the flash memory card is 60 times faster 
than the original flash memory cards.
	
✦	 Image recovery: If you ever accidentally erase a picture from a flash 
memory card, don’t panic (and don’t store any more pictures on that 
flash memory card). If you buy a special file-recovery program, such as 
MediaRECOVER (www.mediarecover.com) or Digital Picture Recovery 
(www.dtidata.com), you can often retrieve deleted pictures from any 
type of flash memory card. However, if you delete a picture and then 
store more pictures on the flash memory card, the new pictures will 
likely wipe out any traces of your deleted pictures, making it impossible 
to retrieve the deleted pictures ever again. 
Many different types of flash memory cards exist because each design is 
meant to set the “standard” for flash memory cards. Unfortunately, every 
flash memory card has its limitations, so companies keep coming up with 
newer designs to overcome these limitations. Because so many “standards” 
exist, the result is that there is no standard. The following are the most pop­
ular flash memory cards:
	
✦	 Compact Flash Type I (CFI) and Compact Flash Type II (CFII): Introduced 
in 1994, CompactFlash cards were one of the first flash memory cards 
available and one of the largest. There are two types of CompactFlash 
cards: Type I (3.3 mm thick), or CFI; and Type II (5.0 mm thick), or CFII. 
	
	 Because of the thickness differences, make sure you use the right 
CompactFlash cards for your digital camera and card reader. A digital 
camera and card reader that can use a CFII card can also use a CFI card, 
but the reverse isn’t true. 
	
✦	 Secure Digital (SD) and Plus Secure Digital (Plus SD): SD cards are 
much smaller than CompactFlash cards and offer built-in encryption 
to prevent storing copyright-infringing materials, such as illegal songs, 
although this encryption feature is rarely used. Because of their small 

262
Understanding Digital Photography
size, Secure Digital cards are slowly evolving into the standard for digital 
photography. Even smaller versions of Secure Digital cards include Mini 
and Micro SD cards, which are often the type of flash memory card used 
in mobile phones.
	
✦	 Memory Stick (MS), Memory Stick Pro (MS Pro), Memory Stick Duo (MS 
Duo), Memory Stick Pro Duo (MS Pro Duo), and Memory Stick Micro (MS 
Micro): The Memory Stick format was developed by Sony, which means that 
only Sony devices (digital cameras, video camcorders, and PlayStations) 
use Memory Sticks for storing digital images. The original Memory Stick 
could store a maximum of only 128MB of data, so Sony created the Memory 
Stick Pro, which can hold up to 32GB of data. The Memory Stick Duo and 
Memory Stick Pro Duo look like an original Memory Stick cut in half. 
	
	 Despite Sony’s backing, the Memory Stick format has never gained 
popularity with other manufacturers. If you buy a Sony camera, you’ll 
probably be stuck with using Memory Sticks, although some of the latest 
Sony cameras now use Secure Digital cards instead.
	
✦	 xD Picture Cards (xD): Olympus and Fuji invented the xD Picture Cards to 
provide yet another standard. Because xD Picture Cards are fairly recent, 
far fewer cameras use them — with the exception, of course, of Olympus 
cameras and some Fuji cameras. An xD Picture Card is often more expen­
sive than other flash memory cards, making them less attractive.
Digital image file formats
When you take pictures, your digital camera stores those pictures in a spe­
cific graphics file format. The three most common file formats for storing 
digital photographs are
	
✦	 JPEG (Joint Photo Experts Group): JPEG is the most common file 
format because it is recognized by most computers and offers the ability 
to compress images to shrink the overall file size. (Compressing a JPEG 
file means decreasing the number of colors used in an image, which 
shrinks the file size but lowers the visual quality.)
	
✦	 TIFF (Tagged Image File Format): If picture quality is more important than 
file size, save your pictures as TIFF files. You can still compress TIFF files 
slightly, but TIFF files always retain all colors. As a result, a compressed 
TIFF file is usually larger than an equivalent compressed JPEG file. 
	
✦	 RAW (which doesn’t stand for anything!): RAW files offer greater visual 
quality; however, there is no single RAW file format standard. As a 
result, every digital camera manufacturer offers its own RAW file format.
	
	 The biggest advantage is that RAW files allow for greater manipulation. 
As a result, professional photographers often use RAW files for greater 
control over manipulating their images. The biggest disadvantage is that 
RAW images take up a large amount of storage space and take longer for 
a digital camera to store them, which means you can’t capture images in 
rapid succession as you can with JPEG files or ordinary film cameras. 

Book III 
Chapter 2
Importing, Viewing, 
and Organizing 
Photos
263
Transferring Digital Images to the Mac
Ultimately, there is no single “best” file format. If a digital camera lets you 
save images in different file formats, experiment to see which one you like 
best. You might prefer one type of file format, such as JPEG, for ordinary use 
but prefer RAW for capturing images in special situations that don’t require 
capturing images quickly, such as taking pictures of a landscape.
Transferring Digital Images to the Mac
To transfer pictures from a digital camera to your Mac, you have two choices. 
First, you can connect your digital camera to your Mac by using a USB cable. 
Second, you can pop the flash memory card out of your digital camera and 
plug it into a card reader, such as the Kingston model shown in Figure 2-2, 
that’s plugged into your Mac. At the time this edition was written, Apple 
introduced new MacBook Pro notebook computers with built-in SD card 
readers. So, unless you have one of these MacBook Pros, you have to buy 
the card reader separately if you want to copy pictures to your Mac that way.
	
Figure 2-2: 
A USB 
memory 
card reader 
allows 
your Mac 
to access 
memory 
cards.
	
No matter which method you use, your Mac then treats all the images stored 
on your digital camera’s flash memory card as just another external drive 
that you can copy pictures from to your Mac’s hard drive (such as into the 
Pictures folder).
When you connect a digital camera or a mobile phone to your Mac, it can 
automatically load a program to retrieve those images. Two programs 
included with your Mac that you can use to retrieve digital snapshots auto­
matically are iPhoto and Image Capture. 
If you organize pictures in iPhoto, choose it as your default application to 
retrieve pictures from a digital camera. If you use a different program to 
organize your pictures, such as Adobe Photoshop, you can make that pro­
gram your default application. If you use more than one program to organize 
your pictures, you can make Image Capture your default application and 
then run the program you want to work with your imported pictures on a 
program-by-program basis.

264

Image Capture window left or right to increase or decrease the size of 
your picture icons.
	
4.	 Click a picture that you want to transfer and click Import, or click 
Import All to retrieve all pictures stored on your camera or smart­
phone.
	
	 To select multiple images, hold down the Ô key and click each picture 
you want to import.
	
5.	 Image Capture marks each picture with a check mark after it copies 
each one to the location selected in the pop-up menu to the left of the 
Import button, as shown in Figure 2-6.
	
6.	 Choose Image Capture➪Quit Image Capture.
	
If you didn’t select the Delete after Import check box, you have to erase the 
pictures from your flash memory card after you import them to your Mac so 
the memory card has space to store more snapshots.

Retrieving photos using a USB memory card reader
A second way to transfer digital images is to use a separate device called 
a card reader (refer to Figure 2-2) which plugs into your Mac’s USB port — 
unless, that is, you have a newer model MacBook Pro that comes with a card 
reader already built-in.
To access a memory card with your Mac, you remove the memory card from 
your camera or smartphone and then plug it into the card reader connected 
to your Mac. Your Mac displays the flash memory card icon on the Desktop 
and its contents in a Finder window the same way it displays an external 
hard drive, as shown in Figure 2-7.

Never yank a flash memory card out of a card reader because doing so might 
cause your Mac to scramble the data on the memory card. Before physically 
removing a flash memory card from a card reader, choose one of the follow­
ing ways to remove a flash memory card safely from your Mac:
	
✦	 Drag the flash memory card icon to the Trash icon in the Dock to eject it.
	
✦	 Click the flash memory icon and choose File➪Eject.
	
✦	 Click the flash memory icon and press Ô+E.
	
✦	 Control-click the flash memory icon and choose Eject from the shortcut 
menu that appears.
	
✦	 Click the Eject button that appears to the right of the flash memory icon 
in the Sidebar of the Finder window.
Capturing Pictures from Other Sources
If you don’t have a separate digital camera, you might have a built-in digital 
camera in your Macintosh. This built-in camera, called iSight, is standard equip­
ment on all newer MacBook and iMac models. You can also find a built-in iSight 
camera on Apple’s LED Cinema Display external monitor that can connect to 
your Mac desktop computer, or act as a second display for your MacBook com­
puter. To capture pictures using this built-in camera, the simplest method is to 
use the Photo Booth program located in your Mac’s Applications folder.
If you’re the type who doesn’t like taking pictures, you might prefer to save 
pictures you like on Web sites you visit. By copying pictures from Web sites, 
you can find images that you wouldn’t normally capture yourself, such as 
images of fighting in the Middle East or pictures of mountain climbers scal­
ing Mount Everest.
	
Pictures stored on Web sites are usually copyrighted, so you cannot legally 
capture those pictures and reuse them for commercial purposes.
Capturing pictures with Photo Booth
If your Mac comes with an iSight camera built-in, you can capture pictures of 
yourself (or whoever or whatever is stationed in front of your Mac), by using 
the Photo Booth program. Pictures you snap with Photo Booth save as JPEG 
files in a Photo Booth folder tucked inside your Pictures folder.
	
You can plug in an optional external Webcam, such as one of the models 
sold by Logitech (www.logitech.com) or Microsoft (www.microsoft.
com/hardware), or plug in certain camcorders, to capture pictures with 
Photo Booth. You can also use one of these optional external choices to 
conduct live, two-way video chats with friends and family, as I write about in 
Book IV, Chapter 3.

270
Capturing Pictures from Other Sources
To capture pictures with Photo Booth, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the Photo Booth icon, which you can find in the 
Applications folder.
	
	 The Photo Booth window appears, displaying the image seen through 
the iSight camera, as shown in Figure 2-8.
	
Figure 2-8: 
Photo Booth 
lets you 
capture 
pictures 
using your 
Mac’s 
built-in 
iSight 
camera. 
	
	
	 If you click the Effects button, you can capture a picture using visual 
effects (such as fish-eye) or in front of a background (such as the Eiffel 
Tower).
	
2.	 Click the camera icon in the middle of the iSight window (or 
press Ô+T).
	
	 Photo Booth counts down from 3 (in seconds) before capturing your pic­
ture. Each captured picture appears at the bottom of the Photo Booth 
window.
	
	 If you hold down the Option key when you click the camera icon (or 
press Ô+T), Photo Booth snaps your picture right away without going 
through the three-second countdown.

3.	 When you finish snapping pictures, choose Photo Booth➪Quit Photo 
Booth or press Ô+Q to exit Photo Booth.
	
	 Photo Booth stores its pictures in a Photo Booth folder inside the 
Pictures folder.
	
You can delete pictures you take with Photo Booth three ways:
	
✦	 Run Photo Booth as described in the previous steps (refer to Figure 2-8), 
click a photo icon in the lower pane that you want to delete, and then 
press the Delete key.
	
✦	 To delete all your Photo Booth photos at one time, choose Edit➪Delete 
All Photos and then click the OK button to confirm your choice.
	
✦	 Open the Photo Booth folder (Pictures➪Photo Booth), click a photo icon 
you want to delete, drag it to the Trash, and then choose File➪Empty 
Trash. (To select more than one picture, hold down the Ô key and then 
click each photo you want to delete.)
	
When you choose the Delete All Photos command, you remove all pictures 
stored in the Photo Booth folder inside the Pictures folder.
Capturing pictures from Web sites
By browsing through different Web sites, you can find a variety of images that 
you might want to use for personal use, such as adding them to an album in 
your iPhoto library of a movie star or public servant whose career you follow.
To save images from a Web page, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Load your favorite Web browser, such as Safari (Applications➪Safari).
	
2.	 Browse to a Web page and Control-click a picture you want. 
	
	 Doing so opens a shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 2-9.
	
	 Generally, because of copyright rules, don’t copy pictures from Web 
sites and reuse those pictures on a commercial Web site.
	
3.	 Choose one of the following commands from the shortcut menu:
 
• Save Image to “Downloads”: Saves the picture in the Downloads 
folder, stored inside your Home folder.
 
• Save Image As: Lets you choose a name for your picture and a folder 
where you want to save the picture.
 
• Add Image to iPhoto Library: Saves the image in your iPhoto photo 
library.
 
•	 Copy Image: Copies the image to the Mac’s invisible clipboard so you 
can paste it into another document, such as an e-mail message or a 
letter to your mom.

	 The Save Image As option is the only one that lets you choose your own 
descriptive name for an image and specify the save location. All the 
other options save an image using that image’s original filename, which 
might be something cryptic like wild_things_LJ-0187.jpg, although 
you can always rename the file later if you want.
	
	 Clicking and dragging a Web image to your Mac’s Desktop (or to a Finder 
window) is one way to quickly capture pictures from Web sites.
Getting Acquainted with Digital Image Editing
One advantage that digital photographs have over traditional film is that you 
can easily edit and modify digital photographs using your Mac. By control­
ling an image right down to the appearance of individual pixels, digital edit­
ing gives you the power to enhance pictures, remove unwanted portions and 
unpleasant effects, such as “red-eye,” or create your own imaginary images 
from your fantasies and dreams.
Editing a picture is typically a two-step process. First, you must select which 
part of the picture you want to change. Second, you have to select how to 
change it, such as by deleting it or coloring it.

Getting Acquainted with Digital Image Editing
To edit a photograph digitally, you can use the iPhoto program that comes 
with your Mac, which I write about in Book V, Chapter 1.
You can also try another digital-editing program, such as one of the following:
	
✦	 Picasa (picassa.google.com): Free image editing and management 
program for organizing your photos, turning photos into movies, col­
lages, and slideshows, and uploading images to Picasa Web Albums to 
share with friends and family.
	
✦	 Photoshop or Photoshop Elements (www.adobe.com): Photoshop 
($699) is the most popular (and expensive) program used by graphics 
artists and designers to manipulate images. A much cheaper and simpler 
version is Photoshop Elements ($89.99), which offers the most com­
monly used features of Photoshop.
	
✦	 Pixelmator (www.pixelmator.com): Like Photoshop, Pixelmator ($59) 
offers layer-based image editing at a fraction of Photoshop’s cost. You 
can quickly create layers from your photos, other pictures, or even your 
iSight camera.
	
✦	 Aperture 2 (www.apple.com/aperture): Aperture ($199) is Apple’s 
professional-level image editing and management program that offers 
advanced image processing, a streamlined interface, faster performance, 
and standout Mac integration.
	
✦	 GraphicConverter (www.lemkesoft.com): Dubbed by the press as 
the “Swiss penknife” of Mac image-editing programs, GraphicConverter 
($34.95) offers all-round image editing with ease of use, a wide range of 
functions, stability, and reliability.

and Movies on Your Mac
In This Chapter

✓	Playing a digital video file
✓	Playing a VCD
✓	Playing a DVD
L
ooking to unwind after a busy day of work? Feel free to kick back, relax, 
and cozy up to a movie on your Mac. Not only can your Mac act as a 
DVD player, but your Mac can also bookmark and store your favorite scenes 
so you can easily rewatch your favorite parts of a movie.
Although many full-length movies appear on DVD, many shorter movies and 
videos are stored entirely as digital video files. Whether a movie is stored 
on DVD or as a digital video file, your Mac can play it at your convenience.
Understanding Video Disc Formats
The most common video disc format is DVD (Digital Video Disc). However, 
DVDs aren’t the only video disc format. An earlier video disc format is VCD 
(Video Compact Disc), which essentially stores video files on ordinary CDs. 
VCDs typically offer lower video quality (comparable to videotape) than 
DVDs and offer much less storage capability than DVDs. Another popular 
format is DiVX, which more and more DVD players can play.
Although DVDs are the video disc standard for most of the world, two com­
peting standards — HD DVD (High-Definition Digital Versatile Disc) and 
Blu-ray — battled it out to become the next hi-def digital disc dominator. 
The war between these two competing formats lasted for about a year, with 
Blu-ray emerging victorious, leaving buyers of HD DVDs with players and 
discs that are now (technically speaking) a thing of the past.
HD DVD can store roughly three times as much data as ordinary DVDs 
(15GB for HD DVD versus 4.7GB for DVDs). Because HD DVDs are similar to 
ordinary DVDs, HD DVDs cost nearly the same to produce.

276
Understanding Digital Video Formats
The main advantage of Blu-ray discs is that they can store much more data 
than even HD DVDs (25GB for a Blu-ray disc versus 15GB for an HD DVD). 
However, Blu-ray discs are also much more expensive to produce. 
The Mac can play DVDs and VCDs out of the box, but if you want to watch 
video stored on HD DVDs or Blu-ray discs, you need to buy a special HD DVD 
or Blu-ray disc drive and a program to use it.
Understanding Digital Video Formats
Video discs are popular for storing and distributing videos, but with high-
speed Internet connections and lower hard drive storage costs, storing 
full-length movies as a single digital video file has become both popular and 
practical. The biggest problem with digital video is the wide variety of digital 
video formats available. To play a digital video file, you need a video player 
program that accepts the type of video file you have. The following is a list 
of digital video file types and the programs that you can use to play them: 
	
✦	 QuickTime (.mov): Playable by the QuickTime Player that comes with 
every Mac.
	
✦	 Audio/Video Interleaved (.avi): An older video file format introduced 
by Microsoft in 1992, although still commonly used today.
	
✦	 Windows Media Video (.wmv): Playable on a Mac if you first install the 
Flip4Mac program (www.flip4mac.com), which allows the QuickTime 
Player to open and play Windows Media Video files.
	
✦	 DivX (.divx): A high-quality video format known for storing DVD-quality 
video images in a digital video file format. DivX files can play on a Mac 
with the free DivX player (www.divx.com) or the free VLC media player 
(www.videolan.org).
	
	 Because DivX is a proprietary video file format, programmers have cre­
ated a similar open source equivalent called Xvid (www.xvid.org).
	
✦	 Flash video (.flv): A video file format commonly used on Web sites, 
such as news sites that offer video (CNN and Reuters) and YouTube, 
MySpace, and Yahoo! Video. You can play flash videos by using the free 
Adobe Flash player (www.adobe.com).
	
✦	 RealVideo (.rm): A video file format often used for streaming video. You 
can play RealVideo files by using the free Real Player program (www.
real.com).
	
✦	 Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG) (.mpg): A video file format that 
consists of different versions, including:
 
• MPEG-1: Used for storing video on VCDs.
 
• MPEG-2: Broadcast-quality video used for storing video on SVCDs, 
DVDs, HD TV, HD DVDs, and Blu-ray discs.

Book III
Chapter 3
Watching Videos 
and Movies on 
Your Mac
277
Playing a Digital Video File
 
• MPEG-3: Originally designed for HD TV but now rarely used.
 
• MPEG-4: For storing video on HD DVD and Blu-ray discs.
	
	 You can view MPEG videos with the QuickTime Player, the free VLC 
media player (www.videolan.org), or the commercial MacVCD player 
(www.mireth.com).
	
The QuickTime Player can’t play MPEG videos if the audio is stored as AC3 
(Dolby Digital) files.
Most video players are free because the companies developing and promot­
ing a specific video file format want as many people as possible to use (and 
rely on) their particular video file format. Then these companies can make 
money by selling programs that create and store video in their specific file 
format.
	
You can download and install a free Mac video enabler (known as a codec ) 
called Perian (www.perian.org) that can give QuickTime the ability to play 
lots of video file types it can’t normally play without such an add-in.
Playing a Digital Video File
Playing a digital video file is as simple as double-clicking that file, which 
opens the appropriate video player on your Mac and displays your video file 
on the screen. If you find a video file on a Web site, you can usually click the 
video file directly on the Web page to see it play within your browser.
Occasionally, you might find a video file format that you can’t play on your 
Mac. In this case, you have two choices:
	
✦	 Download and install a video player for that particular video file format.
	
✦	 Convert the video file into a format that your Mac can play.
Sometimes it might be simpler just to download and install (yet another) 
free video player to watch video encoded in a different video file format. 
However, downloading and installing multiple video players can be annoy­
ing, so you might prefer to convert digital file formats instead. To convert 
digital video files, you need a special digital video file format conversion 
program.
To convert non-copy-protected (and most copy protected) DVD videos to a 
digital video file, such as an AVI or MPEG, you can use a free program called 
HandBrake (http://handbrake.fr). In case you need to convert one digi­
tal video file format into another one (such as converting a DivX file into a 
QuickTime file), grab a copy of the oddly named ffmpegX (www.ffmpegx.
com) or MPEG StreamClip (www.squared5.com). 

278
Playing a DVD
By converting digital video files, you can store all your videos in a single file 
format, such as QuickTime, to avoid having to download and install half a 
dozen video players just to watch your collection of video files.
Playing a DVD
The most common video disc format is the DVD format. To play DVDs, just 
insert your DVD into your Mac. DVD Player loads and displays your DVD’s 
main menu, as shown in Figure 3-1.
	
Figure 3-1: 
When DVD 
Player 
starts, it 
displays the 
inserted 
DVD’s main 
menu.
	
Click the menu options to select them (or use your Mac’s arrow keys to 
move through the DVD’s menu options and then press the Return key or 
spacebar to select them), such as Play Movie, or Special Features.
If you just want to watch a DVD from start to finish, you don’t have to read 
the rest of this chapter. However, if you want to use some of the special fea­
tures of DVD Player, keep reading.
Understanding full screen mode and window mode
One of the simplest ways to customize your video is to switch between full 
screen mode and window mode. In full screen mode, the video fills your 
entire computer screen. In window mode, the video fills only part of your 
computer screen while giving you access to the rest of your Mac Desktop, 
such as the Dock and other program windows, as shown in Figure 3-2.

Viewing a video in a window
When you exit full screen mode, your video appears in a window with the 
Controller displayed underneath the DVD window. (Refer to Figure 3-2.) By 
choosing the View menu, you can display a video in the following window sizes:
	
✦	 Half Size
	
✦	 Actual Size
	
✦	 Double Size
	
✦	 Fit to Screen
	
✦	 Enter Full Screen
When viewing a video in a window, the Controller takes on a different skin 
(the display appearance), as shown in Figure 3-4.
Although the Controller in both full screen and window mode allows you 
to control a DVD, each Controller offers slightly different features. You can 
access some features in both full screen and window mode, but many fea­
tures are available only in one mode or the other.

as the feature presentation or trivia clips. Some DVDs also offer a Title menu 
that lets you pick different episodes, such as a DVD containing multiple epi­
sodes from a single TV show season. Some DVDs offer both an initial menu 
and a Title menu. To jump to the initial DVD or Title menu (and note that not

all DVDs have one), try clicking the Menu button (DVD menu) or the Title 
button on the Controller.
If you want to start the DVD from the very beginning, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In full screen mode, move the pointer to the top of the screen to 
display the DVD Player menu bar.
	
2.	 Choose Go➪Beginning of Disc. 
	
	 Your DVD starts playing from the beginning.
Skipping through a video
Sometimes you might want to skip over or replay part of a video. To skip 
backward or forward through a video, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Switch to full screen mode and then click the Pause button.
	
2.	 Click one of the following buttons on the Controller:
 
• Rewind: Reverses the video a few frames and starts playing 
normally again
 
• Fast Forward: Jumps the video ahead a few frames and starts playing 
normally again
	
Hold down the Ô key and press the left or right arrow keys to move back­
ward or forward. Press the arrow key again while still holding down the Ô 
key to increase the rewind or fast forward speed incrementally by 2X, 4X, 
8X, 16X, or 32X with each press of the arrow key. To stop rewinding or fast-
forwarding and resume playing the video at normal speed, press the Play 
button or press the spacebar.
When you click the Rewind or Fast Forward buttons, the video jumps back 
(or ahead) only a few frames. If you want to keep rewinding or fast-forwarding 
continuously, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Switch to window mode and choose Controls➪Scan Forward (or Scan 
Backwards). 
	
	 Your video continuously rewinds or fast-forwards.
	
2.	 Click the Play button on the Controller or press the spacebar to play 
the video at its normal speed. 
	
Hold down the Ô key and tap the left or right arrow keys to move continu­
ally backwards or forwards. (You can let go of the Ô key.) Hold down the Ô 
key again and tap the arrow key again to increase the rewind or fast forward 
speed incrementally by 2X, 4X, 8X, 16X, or 32X with each press of the arrow 
key. To stop rewinding or fast-forwarding and play the video at normal 
speed, click the Play button or press the spacebar.

282
Playing a DVD
	
You can also drag the slider at the bottom of the Controller (in full screen 
mode) to rewind or fast-forward a video.
Viewing frames in steps and slow motion
If you want to study a particular part of a video, the DVD Player lets you 
view individual frames one at a time or view your video in slow motion. To 
view individual frames, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In window mode, click the Step Frame button on the Controller. 
	
	 Each time you click the Step Frame button, the video advances one frame.
	
2.	 Click the Play button on the Controller, or press the spacebar to play 
the video at normal speed. 
Stepping through a video one frame at a time can be tedious, so an easier 
way to step through a video is in slow motion. To view your video in slow 
motion, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Switch to window mode and then click the Slow Motion button on the 
Controller or choose Controls➪Slow Motion. 
	
2.	 Click the Play button on the Controller, or press the spacebar to play 
the video at normal speed. 
Skipping by chapters
Most DVD videos are divided into segments called chapters, which are 
usually listed somewhere on or inside the DVD case. If you want to view a 
favorite scene, just jump to the chapter that contains your favorite scene.
To move between chapters, choose one of the following:
	
✦	 In full screen mode, move your pointer to the top of the screen and then 
click the thumbnail image of the chapter you want to skip to.
	
✦	 Click the Previous Chapter or Next Chapter button on the Controller.
	
✦	 Press the left-arrow (previous) or right-arrow (next) key while the video 
is playing.
Placing bookmarks in a video
Sometimes your favorite parts of a movie don’t correlate exactly to chapter 
sections on a DVD. In case you want to be able to jump to a specific part of a 
video, you can create a bookmark. 
	
DVD Player saves your bookmarks on your Mac’s hard drive, so if you pop 
the DVD out and back in again, your bookmarks are still preserved.

Viewing closed captioning
Many DVDs (but not all) include closed captioning and subtitles. Closed 
captioning displays written dialogue onscreen in the same language that’s 
being spoken — English, for example — whereas subtitles give you a choice 
of reading dialogue onscreen in a language other than what’s being spoken, 
such as French and Spanish. 
To turn on closed captioning, choose one of the following:
	
✦	 In window mode, choose Features➪Closed Captioning➪Turn On.
	
✦	 In full screen mode, click the Closed Captioning button on the Controller 
and choose Turn On Closed Captioning.
To view subtitles in different languages, choose one of the following:
	
✦	 In window mode, choose Features➪Subtitles and then choose a lan­
guage, such as French or Spanish.
	
✦	 In full screen mode, click the Closed Captioning button on the Controller 
and choose a language under the Subtitles category.

288
Playing a DVD
Viewing different camera angles
Some DVDs, such as those containing video of concerts, offer a choice of 
multiple camera angles. This gives you a chance to view a DVD and, at a cer­
tain spot, switch from looking at the drummer to the lead guitarist. 
To switch to a different camera angle, choose one of the following methods:
	
✦	 In window mode, click the Angle button on the Controller and then 
choose an angle. (If the DVD you’re watching doesn’t offer optional 
angles, the video will continue playing without changing the way it 
looks.)
	
✦	 In window mode, choose Features➪Angle and then choose an angle.
	
✦	 In full screen mode, click the Streams/Closed Captioning button on the 
Controller and then choose an angle under the Angle category.
Choosing different audio tracks
Sometimes a DVD might offer multiple audio tracks, such as a default audio 
track and alternative audio tracks of foreign languages. To switch to differ­
ent audio tracks, choose one of the following:
	
✦	 In window mode, click the Audio button on the Controller and then 
choose an audio track. (If the DVD you’re watching has only one audio 
track, the audio will continue playing without changing how you’re 
hearing the audio.)
	
✦	 In window mode, choose Features➪Audio and then choose an audio 
track.
	
✦	 In full screen mode, click the Streams/Closed Captioning button on the 
Controller and then choose an audio track under the Audio Streams 
category.
Customizing DVD Player
Normally, you can pop a DVD into your Mac and watch it play right away. 
However, you might want to take some time to customize DVD Player to 
change how it plays.
Parental controls
If you don’t want your children watching certain DVDs, you can turn on DVD 
Player’s parental controls. These parental controls are designed either to 

Book III 
Chapter 3
Watching Videos 
and Movies on  
Your Mac
289
Playing a DVD
block certain types of DVDs from playing or to prevent certain objectionable 
scenes from appearing while allowing the rest of the movie to be seen. 
	
Because of the extra expense involved in adding parental control features to 
a DVD, many DVDs don’t support parental controls. If you turn on parental 
controls, it’s entirely possible to watch an inappropriate DVD on your Mac if 
the DVD isn’t programmed to implement the parental control features. 
To turn on (or off) parental controls, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In full screen mode, move the pointer to the top of the screen to 
display the DVD Player menu bar and then choose Features➪
Enable Parental Controls. 
	
	 A dialog appears, asking for your password.
	
2.	 Type your password and then click OK.
	
To disable parental controls choose Features➪Disable Parental Controls.
Defining DVD Player preferences
DVD Player offers six categories for modifying how to play DVDs:
	
✦	 General: Defines how DVD Player behaves when running, such as 
whether to start in full screen mode.
	
✦	 Disc Setup: Allows you to change the language used to display audio, 
subtitles, and DVD menus.
	
✦	 Full Screen: Defines how other program windows behave when you 
watch a DVD video in full screen mode.
	
✦	 Windows: Defines how to display closed captioning in a window.
	
✦	 Previously Viewed: Defines how to handle a DVD that was ejected and 
inserted back into your Mac, such as whether to start playing the DVD at 
the beginning or at the last scene viewed before you ejected the DVD.
	
✦	 High Definition: Defines how to play high-definition DVDs that were 
burned to a DVD using the optional program DVD Studio Pro.
To change DVD Player’s preferences settings, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In full screen mode, move the pointer to the top of the screen to display 
the DVD Player menu bar and then choose DVD Player — Preferences.
	
	 A Preferences dialog appears, as shown in Figure 3-9.

Control Programs and Using Front 
Row for Music, Movies, and Photos

I
f you want to watch videos, play music, or browse through digital photo­
graphs, you could load QuickTime Player, iTunes, and iPhoto and search 
for the videos, audio files, or pictures you want to hear or see. However, this 
can be something of a juggling act, especially if you want to play music and 
browse through your photograph collection at the same time. 
To give you another way to access your video, audio, and digital images, 
your Mac comes with a program called Front Row. The whole purpose of 
Front Row is to integrate the features of the QuickTime Player, iTunes, the 
DVD Player, and iPhoto to make it easy for you to access your media with­
out having to load a bunch of programs.
Although new Macs don’t come with an Apple Remote control, some earlier 
model Macs do, and you can also buy one for your Mac (www.apple.com) 
if your Mac has an Infrared port. With the Apple Remote control, you con­
trol Front Row from your easy chair. You can also use the Apple Remote to 
control many of your Mac’s other programs, including Keynote, iTunes, and 
iPhoto.
	
If your Mac doesn’t have a built-in Infrared port, you can buy an external 
Infrared receiver called Mira (twistedmelon.com/mira) that plugs into 
your Mac’s USB port and gives it the same remote-control-friendly capabili­
ties as a Mac with a built-in Infrared port. 

292
Using the Apple Remote
Using the Apple Remote
The easiest way to control Front Row is by using the Apple Remote, although 
you can also control Front Row by using your Mac’s keyboard (in case you 
don’t have an Apple Remote). The Apple Remote provides the following con­
trols, as shown in Figure 4-1:

For your Mac to pick up the Apple Remote’s Infrared (IR) signal, your Mac 
must be in “line of sight” range when you point it at your Mac and press the 
remote control’s buttons.
Although the Apple Remote can control the Front Row program, it can also 
control your Mac and other programs, such as Keynote, which can be handy 
if you want to control it from a distance when you’re using your Mac to give 
a presentation.

Using the Apple Remote
Pairing an Apple Remote with a Mac
If you have two or more Mac computers, an iPod, or an Apple TV unit in the 
same room, your Apple Remote can accidentally control multiple devices instead 
of only the one you want to control. To make sure your Apple Remote works 
with only a particular Mac, you can pair the Apple Remote with that specific Mac.
To pair an Apple Remote to a specific Mac, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Hold the Apple Remote 4 to 6 inches away from the Infrared (IR) port 
on the Mac you want to control and then press the Menu and Next but­
tons at the same time. 
	
2.	 When a paired-remote icon appears a few seconds later, release the 
Menu and Next buttons. 
	
	 Your Apple Remote is now paired to work only with that specific Mac.
To unpair an Apple Remote from a specific Mac, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences on the Mac that you want to unpair 
from an Apple Remote to open the System Preferences window.
	
2.	 Click the Security icon to open your Mac’s Security preferences pane 
and then click the General tab (if it isn’t already selected) to display 
the General options, as shown in Figure 4-2.
	
Figure 4-2:

Using the Apple Remote
Making a Mac go to sleep
To make your Mac go to sleep by using the Apple Remote, hold down the 
Play/Pause button until a sleeping Apple Remote icon appears on the screen 
and then release the Play/Pause button. 
	
To wake up a sleeping Mac with the Apple Remote, just tap any button on 
the Apple Remote. 
Booting up a Mac
If you’ve divided your hard drive into partitions and installed two different 
operating systems (such as using Boot Camp to run Windows), you can use 
the Apple Remote to help you choose which partition and operating system 
to use by following these steps:
	
1.	 Hold down the Menu button on the Apple Remote and turn on (or 
restart) your Mac. 
	
	 The hard drive icons that appear list all the startup partitions you can 
choose.
	
2.	 Press the Previous and Next buttons to select a hard drive and then 
press the Play/Pause button to start your Mac with the selected 
hard drive.
Controlling applications
You can use the Apple Remote to control several popular programs, includ­
ing Keynote, iTunes, iPhoto, and DVD Player. 
	
The Apple Remote can control different programs, but it won’t let you 
switch, open, or close programs. If you want to do this from a distance, use a 
wireless keyboard and mouse.
The Apple Remote is so simple to use, you can usually figure out how it 
works with a particular program by loading the program, pointing the Apple 
Remote at your Mac, and then pressing its couple of buttons to see what 
they do. Some programs you can control with the Apple Remote, and tips on 
how you can control these programs include
	
✦	 Keynote: Press the Play/Pause button to begin viewing a presenta­
tion. To view the next (or previous) slide, press the Next (or Previous) 
button. Press the Menu button to display thumbnails of your slides. 
Holding down the Menu button exits your presentation and returns you 
to the main Keynote screen.
	
✦	 iTunes: Choose a playlist (or choose your entire music collection) and 
then press the Play/Pause button to start listening to your selection. Press 
the Previous button to restart the playing track from the beginning. 
Press the Previous button twice in rapid succession to start playing

then press the Play/Pause button. To view the previous (or next) photo­
graph, press the Previous (or Next) button. Exit from your slideshow by 
holding down the Menu button. 
	
✦	 DVD Player: To start playing a DVD, press the Play/Pause button. 
Choose an option from the DVD menus by pressing the Previous and 
Next buttons and select an option by pressing the Play/Pause button. 
Use the Up and Down buttons to adjust the volume.
Using Front Row
You can easily control separate programs, such as iTunes and DVD Player, 
with the Apple Remote, but you must manually switch between your Mac’s 
different media-playing programs to listen to music, watch a movie, or look at 
your photographs. To overcome the hassle of working with multiple programs, 
Front Row provides a simple, consistent user interface for accessing all your 
media files whether they’re stored in your Music, Movies, or Pictures folder. 
	
Before using Front Row, you need to store your favorite songs, podcasts, 
and music videos in iTunes; your favorite pictures in iPhoto; and your favor­
ite movies in your Movies folder. Alternatively, you can have a CD or DVD in 
your Mac.
The really great thing about Front Row is that after you learn how to con­
trol its simple menus, choosing, viewing, or listening to your content works 
pretty much the same across the board — be it watching a home video or 
Hollywood blockbuster movie you rent with iTunes, enjoying a photo slide­
show of your family vacation, or listening to a podcast you subscribe to or 
new album you ripped to your Mac’s hard drive.
Starting Front Row
To start Front Row, choose one of the following:
	
✦	 Press the Menu button on the Apple Remote.
	
	 If you have a program running that can accept commands from the 
Apple Remote, such as Keynote, pressing the Menu button might control 
that program instead of starting Front Row.
	
✦	 Double-click the Front Row icon in the Applications folder.
	
✦	 Press Ô+Esc.
Each time you start Front Row, the Front Row menu appears, as shown in 
Figure 4-3.

The following list highlights ways to navigate through the Front Row menu: 
	
✦	 Highlighting an option in Front Row: To highlight an option on the 
Front Row menu, press the Up and Down buttons on the Apple Remote 
or press the up- and down-arrow keys on the keyboard.
	
✦	 Selecting an option in Front Row: After you highlight an option on a 
Front Row menu, you can select that option by pressing the Play/Pause 
button on the Apple Remote or by pressing Return on the keyboard.
	
	 You find out more about different options in Front Row later in this 
chapter.
	
✦	 Exiting a Front Row submenu: To exit from a Front Row submenu and 
see the previous menu, press the Menu button on the Apple remote or 
press Esc on the keyboard.
	
If you keep pressing the Menu button on the Apple Remote or keep pressing 
Esc on the keyboard, you’ll eventually exit from the main Front Row menu 
altogether and exit Front Row in the process.

with an Apple Remote control or your Mac’s keyboard, as I describe in the 
previous “Using Front Row” section.
Playing Movies and Videos
Front Row can play DVDs or digital video files you copied to your Mac’s hard 
drive, and music videos, TV shows, and full-length motion pictures that you 
purchased from the iTunes Store. The four Front Row menu options that 
allow you to watch movies and videos are
	
✦	 DVD: Plays a movie from the DVD you insert into your Mac’s DVD drive.
	
✦	 Movies: Plays digital video files, such as digital video you shot with 
your camcorder and copied to your Mac’s hard drive, or digital video 
you downloaded from the iTunes Store or from some other place on the 
Internet.
	
✦	 TV Shows: Plays TV show segments and entire shows you downloaded 
from the iTunes Store or obtained from another source.
	
✦	 Music: Plays music videos you downloaded from the iTunes Store or 
acquired from other sources.
Playing a DVD
To play a DVD in Front Row, insert a DVD into your Mac, and when the DVD 
menu appears, choose one of the following options:
	
✦	 Resume Playing: Starts playing from the last part of the DVD that you 
watched before ejecting the disc or quitting Front Row.
	
✦	 Start from Beginning: Starts playing the DVD from the very beginning, 
including the usual FBI notice warning about copyright infringement.
	
✦	 Eject Disk: Ejects the DVD.
	
✦	 DVD Menu: Displays the DVD’s menus.
Playing movies, TV shows, music videos, 
and other videos
You can play video content with Front Row by selecting one of Front Row’s 
main menu categories, scrolling through that category’s list of content items, 
and then selecting the one you want to watch.

298
Playing Movies and Videos
Here I describe the options and choices that appear when you select each 
of the different kinds of videos you can play with Front Row, and how to 
play them.
Movies
Selecting Movies displays the following choices, as shown in Figure 4-4:
	
✦	 iTunes Top Movies: Displays trailers of the most popular movies pur­
chased from the iTunes Store.
	
✦	 Theatrical Trailers: Displays trailers of the latest movies currently in 
theaters.
	
✦	 Movies Folder: Displays digital video files stored in your Movies folder.
	
✦	 iTunes Movies: Lists movies you added to your Mac with iTunes that are 
stored in the Movies folder of your Mac’s iTunes Music folder (typically 
in your Mac’s Home folder➪Music➪iTunes➪Movies).
	
If you select iTunes Top Movies or Theatrical Trailers, you see another menu 
listing your options, similar to the menu shown in Figure 4-5. If you select 
Movies Folder, you see a list of all digital video files stored in your Movies

Front Row can play CDs, audio files downloaded from the iTunes Store, such 
as songs, podcasts, and audiobooks, and audio ripped from CDs or copied 
from another source to your Mac’s hard disk. The following four Front Row 
menu options allow you to play audio files:
	
✦	 Audio CD: Plays music stored on a CD.
	
✦	 Music: Plays digital music files you downloaded from iTunes, or audio 
tracks you copied to your Mac’s hard drive.

ries, or other journalistic special features, or recordings of radio shows.
	
✦	 Audiobooks: Plays spoken audio recordings of books.
Playing an audio CD
To play an audio CD in Front Row, insert the audio CD into your Mac, select 
the Music option to display the Music menu and your audio CD, select your 
audio CD to display a list of songs (as shown in Figure 4-8), and then select 
the first song you want to hear.

Playing digital audio files
You can play audio content with Front Row by selecting one of Front Row’s 
main menu audio categories, scrolling through that category’s content items, 
and then selecting the audio item you want to listen to. Here I describe the 
options and choices that appear when you select to play either music or 
podcasts with Front Row, and how to play them.
Music
Choosing Music displays the Music menu, including the name of any CD you 
might have inserted in your Mac’s drive, such as a music or audiobook CD, 
or songs in your iTunes library, as shown in Figure 4-9:
	
✦	 Shuffle Songs: Randomly mixes all the songs stored in iTunes.
	
✦	 Music Videos: Lists all music videos you have stored in iTunes.
	
✦	 Playlists: Lists all the playlists you’ve created in iTunes.

Playing Music and Other Audio
Selecting any of these choices other than Shuffle Songs opens another menu 
listing the audio tracks contained within the category. Scroll through the 
lists to view your audio tracks and then select the one you want to listen to.
Podcasts
Podcasts are recorded interviews, radio shows, or other kinds of informa­
tional and episodic audio or video recordings that you can download with 
iTunes and listen to at your convenience.
Choosing Podcasts from the Front Row main menu (refer to Figure 4-3) 
displays the Podcasts menu. Scroll through your list of podcasts and then 
select the one you want to listen to or watch.
Playing audiobooks
Audiobooks are spoken recordings of books, which can be convenient to 
hear while you’re exercising, dining, or commuting. After you download or 
rip an audiobook from a CD and store it in iTunes, you can hear the audio­
book through Front Row by selecting Music Menu➪Audiobook and then 
selecting the audiobook you want to listen to.
Front Row turns your Mac screen into an enter­
tainment center, but what if you have a 52-inch 
high-definition TV in your living room? Rather 
than use Front Row to watch a DVD on your 
MacBook’s comparatively miniscule 13-inch 
screen, you might want to play that DVD on 
your 52-inch big-screen TV. In that case, you 
can ignore your Mac completely and buy a 
separate DVD player connected to your big-
screen TV. Or you can use your Mac’s video-
out port and a special adapter (that you may 
have to buy separately) to connect your Mac to 
one of your HDTV’s video-in ports with a spe­
cial video cable (that you also may have to buy 
separately). Or you can skip the separate DVD 
player and cable clutter and get Apple TV to 
control DVDs, downloaded movies, music and 
audio, and picture slideshows with your Apple 
Remote.
Apple TV is a component that physically con­
nects to your TV with audio and video cables. 
After you connect Apple TV to your TV screen, 
Apple TV wirelessly (or through cables if you 
prefer) connects to your Mac (or PC) to transfer 
movies, TV shows, music, and photos from your 
computer to the Apple TV unit. Apple TV then 
broadcasts those media on your big-screen TV 
and plays the sound through your TV’s speak­
ers or a surround-sound system if you have one 
connected to your home entertainment system. 
Essentially, Apple TV acts like a wired or wire­
less connection between your Mac and your 
big-screen TV for playing movies, TV show 
episodes, and music that you downloaded from 
iTunes or copied to your Mac’s hard drive from 
CDs, DVDs, and other sources, such as your 
digital camera or camcorder.

To view your iPhoto pictures in Front Row, select the Photos from the Front 
Row main menu (refer to Figure 4-3) and then select an album, such as 
Photos or Last 12 Months, to watch the slideshow.

Mac is great for helping you get stuff done — and it’s equally talented at 
showing you a good time without breaking any laws to do it. There are loads 
of ways you can have fun with your Mac. You can start with several free 
games that can turn your Mac into a chess, checkers, or tic-tac-toe oppo­
nent. If you get tired of these games, you can always buy more from a vast 
array of video games to choose from. 
Games can double as effective learning tools, too. With the right programs, 
you can turn your Mac into an inspiring math, grammar, or science tutor, 
or a motivating foreign language or music teacher. Or, rather than pick 
up a new skill, you can use your Mac to help with your current hobbies. 
Although Macs might not help you skydive or do the Mambo, your Mac can 
run unique programs covering everything from needlepoint to gardening 
to collecting and trading baseball cards. Read on to explore some ideas for 
enjoying your free time (or ways to take a break and goof off at work when 
the boss isn’t looking).

Perhaps you’ve always wanted to learn another language but don’t have the 
time to take a class. Good news: With your Mac, you can learn a new lan­
guage on your own schedule without having to step foot outside your own 
front door.
The best way to learn any foreign language is to immerse yourself in listen­
ing, speaking, and reading it. Your Mac can’t literally put you on the streets 
of, say, Osaka, Japan, but it can act as a friendly guide and tutor while 

306
¿No Hablas Español? Then Get Crackin’!
exposing you to the voices of native speakers. You can even speak into your 
Mac’s built-in microphone and have your pronunciation analyzed (a great 
way to hone your accent before anyone hears you and questions which lan­
guage you’re trying to speak). Whether you’re learning a foreign language in 
school, for fun, or for business, you can use programs on your Mac to prac­
tice speaking, reading, and writing a foreign language.
For free language lessons, visit the BBC site at www.bbc.co.uk/languages 
to find introductory vocabulary lessons, pronunciation audio files, and 
videos in a variety of languages. (See Figure 5-1.) These introductory lessons 
won’t make you fluent in a new language, but they can teach you the basics.
Another useful (and free) language Web site is UniLang (http://home.
unilang.org), which is a community-run site that provides free resources 
to anyone interested in learning practically any language, including 
Lithuanian, Afrikaans, and Gaelic. Some of its many language resources 
include children’s stories, phrasebooks, and vocabulary lists so that you can 
make your own flash cards.

Free language lessons can get you started, but for more advanced language 
lessons, you’ll want to consider buying a language course. Here are some 
choices, for your consideration:
	
✦	 Berlitz (www.berlitzbooks.com): Provides audio courses focused on 
helping travelers master useful phrases that they’ll likely need when 
they travel overseas, such as “May we have the check, please?” or “Do 
you speak Portuguese?” 
	
✦	 Pimsleur (www.pimsleurapproach.com): Named after its creator, 
Dr. Paul Pimsleur, the Pimsleur method focuses on teaching foreign 
languages primarily by listening to the most commonly used words in 
each language. Besides emphasizing listening, the Pimsleur method also 
encourages responding by gradually piecing together the grammar of a 
language through constant repetition and practice. Pimsleur’s principle is 
that anyone can learn a new language in the same way that infants learn 
to speak, which is by listening and then attempting to speak back to their 
parents (until they’re old enough to start arguing with their parents). 
	
✦	 Transparent Language (www.transparent.com): Offers free language 
articles (so that you can practice reading), free language games, and free 
introductory language lessons to teach you how to recognize and speak 
basic vocabulary so you can communicate with people in other coun­
tries without resorting to hand signals.
	
✦	 Rosetta Stone (www.rosettastone.com): One of the most acclaimed 
language courses, Rosetta Stone emphasizes listening, reading, writ­
ing, and speaking another language. By focusing on four different ele­
ments of learning any language, Rosetta Stone is the closest you can get 
to immersing yourself in another country. Figure 5-2 shows different 
phrases on the screen that you can choose in response to hearing a 
question in a foreign language. By turning learning into a game, you can 
pick up a new language while having fun in the process.
	
✦	 Unforgettable Languages (www.unforgettablelanguages.com): If 
you have trouble remembering foreign words, you might try this course, 
which teaches foreign words by relating them to another word. For 
example, to help you remember the Mandarin word for tree (shu, pro­
nounced like “shoe”), you’re told to think of a shoe in a tree. By using 
such vivid word associations, this course can make memorizing vocabu­
lary words fun.
	
✦	 Power-Glide (www.power-glide.com): These courses make learning 
a new language interactive through videos, stories, and games. By rein­
forcing language concepts in multiple ways, Power-Glide helps make 
learning and remembering a foreign language as effortless as possible.

Learning to play an instrument is much like learning a foreign language. You 
can’t just read about it; you have to hear and try it yourself, listening and 
correcting as you go along. The good news is that with the right program 
you can turn your Mac into an interactive music teacher.
To learn how to read music and chords, check out Practica Musica (www.
ars-nova.com), shown in Figure 5-3, which can help train your ear to rec­
ognize different notes while practicing writing your own music at the same 
time.

Getting Touchy-Feely with Your Keyboard
After you understand how music works and how to read it, you might be 
anxious to start making music of your own. If you want to learn to play the 
guitar, buy GuitarVision (www2.guitarvision.com), which works with 
iTunes to help you learn the exact chords, notes, and finger positioning to 
play many of your favorite songs stored in iTunes.
Or, you might try learning to tickle the ivories with PianoWizard (www.
pianowizard.com), which uses video games to help you play your favorite 
songs, in genres from classical to pop. If you’re a teenager, you can play and 
hear your favorite music while annoying your parents at the same time.
If you’re into the idea of playing more than one instrument as a one-man- or 
one-woman-band, you’ll want to check out the guitar, drums, piano, or violin 
tutorial programs for your Mac produced by eMedia (www.emediamusic.
com).
If you don’t want to spend any money, why not mosey on over to the musi­
cally inclined GarageBand program that comes with your Mac or can be pur­
chased separately as part of Apple’s iLife creative suite of programs? 
With GarageBand, you can learn to play piano and guitar, record your tunes, 
and mix them to produce the perfect song. Think of GarageBand as your 
Mac’s all-in-one production studio, music teacher, and recording engineer 
that’s ready, willing, and able to help you write and record your music.
To learn more about using GarageBand to express yourself, musically speak­
ing, check out Book V, Chapter 4.
Getting Touchy-Feely with Your Keyboard
No more poking along on the computer keyboard with your index fingers. 
You know people are looking at you funny. Even your Jack Russell Terrier 
types better than you do. To finally start getting the hang of your keyboard, 
check out one of the most popular typing tutorials, Mavis Beacon Teaches 
Typing (available from www.broderbund.com), which has been used in 
schools and employment agencies for years. This program combines typing 
lessons with arcade games to make learning fun. (Now if bosses would only 
use arcade games to make working in an office fun, we’d be all set.)
Another popular typing program is Ten Thumbs Typing Tutorial (www.
tenthumbstypingtutor.com), shown in Figure 5-4. In addition to provid­
ing the usual drills and games to teach typing, the program also works with 
iTunes by letting you type lyrics from your favorite songs. For greater flex­
ibility, practice typing lyrics from different types of songs, or else if you only 
type lyrics from rap music, you might get really good at typing four-letter 
words and nothing else.

Playing Hooky with Your Hobby
To find all sorts of educational software for you or your children, go shop­
ping on the Web at Academic Superstore (www.academicsuperstore.
com). With so many different ways to keep yourself amused while learning, 
you’ll never have an excuse for not learning something new today.
Playing Hooky with Your Hobby
Most folks have a hobby that they’d rather be doing instead of work. 
Although hobbies can be fun, they often have tedious or repetitive actions 
that can suck up your time and make you feel like you’re at a job. To keep 
such necessary, mind-numbing actions from stopping you from fully enjoy­
ing your hobby, load the right program and let your Mac help you speed up 
and simplify your hobby more than ever.
If you enjoy scrapbooking, that is, combining photographs, memorabilia, and 
journaling into a book to keep track of your memories, you might want to digi­
tize the whole process. Grab your favorite digital photographs and place them 
in a digital scrapbook using iScrapbook 2 (available at www.chronosnet.
com) or iRemember (www.macscrapbook.com). Best of all, both programs 
can import pictures from iPhoto so you can take advantage of all the photos 
you’ve gathered and organized into your existing iPhoto photo library. 
Not only can digital scrapbooks store your memories, but also they allow 
you to share them with others in ways that physical scrapbooks cannot. You 
can e-mail them or print them after embellishing them with fancy borders 
and graphics.
Naturally, the people who might want to share your memories are your rela­
tives. To help you keep track of your relatives and your family tree, you can 
use MacFamilyTree 5 (available at www.onlymac.de), Family 2.3 (www.
saltatory.com), or Reunion 9 (http://leisterpro.com). By making it 
easy to track family names, photographs, birthdates, and locations, you can 
track your relatives wherever they go (and avoid them if necessary). 
If you enjoy working with needlepoint, you might want to create your own 
designs with Stitch Painter (www.cochenille.com). Coin collectors 
might want to grab a copy of Numismatist’s Notebook (available at www.
tabberer.com/sandyknoll), and comic book collectors might want a 
copy of ComicBookLover (www.bitcartel.com). If you’re the outdoor type 
who enjoys gardening, try using PlanGarden (www.plangarden.com) to 
choose the best plants for your area.
Want to design your dream house or need to remodel your current house? 
You can draw your own plans by using Interiors (www.microspot.com). 
To help pay for your new house or remodeling project, try Lotto Sorcerer 
(www.satoripublishing.com/LS) to help you win your state’s lottery. 
Lotto Sorcerer predicts the numbers most likely to appear based on it being

impossible to create truly random numbers, so some numbers will always 
have a slightly greater chance of being picked than others. 
No matter what your hobby or interests are, likely a program can help you 
enjoy your hobby even more.

Historians might someday chronicle the computer’s role in increasing busi­
ness productivity and communication, but everyone really knows that the 
computer’s greatest contribution to society has been to help people play 
games. Four popular types of video games are
	
✦	 Computerized versions of traditional board games like chess and 
backgammon
	
✦	 Strategy games that emphasize planning and thinking
	
✦	 Arcade games that emphasize eye-hand coordination
	
✦	 Multiplayer, online virtual worlds
	
Some games combine multiple elements, such as a multiplayer game that 
emphasizes arcade-style play, or a multiplayer game that lets people play 
bridge or poker online. 
Some video games can be educational, such as teaching you how to manage 
a business, whereas other video games can be nostalgic, such as ancient 
arcade video games like Pac-Man or Space Invaders. Still other video games 
can provide an emotional outlet so you can blast away aliens, terrorists, and 
other fictional computer-generated characters to vent your frustration on 
them rather than on a living creature within your reach. If you just want to 
play video games, you can turn your Mac into a great entertainment center.
Playing strategically
Strategy games are typically based on their complicated board game coun­
terparts. Unlike arcade-style games where reflexes determine your success, 
strategy games rely on planning and thinking to win. Aspyr (www.aspyr.
com) provides several popular strategy games.
Aspyr also sells Sid Meier’s Civilization game, which lets you control an 
entire civilization. Using trade, politics, and outright war, you can expand 
your civilization at the expense of others and try to take over the world with­
out having to be elected to political office to do it.
If you ever dreamed about running your own TV station, play TV Station 
Manager (available from Winter Wolves at www.winterwolves.com), 
where you control the programming of an independent TV station and do 

Book III 
Chapter 5
Having Fun

313

whatever you can to boost ratings. If you think there’s too much garbage 
on TV these days, see whether you can make your TV station profitable by 
offering quality entertainment. Like most real TV stations, you might find 
that trashy TV shows really are more profitable in the long run.
The same company, Winter Wolves, also provides Soccer Manager and 
Boxing Manager. In Soccer Manager, you manage a soccer team and choose 
different players to build the most successful soccer team. In Boxing 
Manager, you pick a boxer and manage him through fights. Manage your 
boxer effectively, and he can work his way up to the championship. Manage 
him poorly, and he’ll wind up flat on his back on the canvas.
Sports Interactive Games (www.sigames.com) offers Out of the Park 
Baseball Manager and NHL Eastside Hockey Manager, where you can pre­
tend to manage a professional sports team and guide them to victory. See 
if you can win a baseball championship without any of your players relying 
on banned performance-enhancing drugs. Take your hockey team to the top 
while trying to keep the front teeth of all your players intact. The challenges 
can be endless.
One popular series of strategy games is the Tycoon series, such as Roller 
Coaster Tycoon (where you design and manage an amusement park) and 
Zoo Tycoon (where you design and manage a zoo). These Tycoon games let 
you fantasize about how you could make your local zoo or amusement park 
more exciting and profitable if only given the chance. Add a death-defying 
roller coaster to your amusement park and see how sales of milkshakes from 
a nearby concession stand might go down. Add an exotic animal to your zoo 
and see how much additional revenue you can generate without exploiting 
the animal in the process.
If the idea of being a manager sounds too tame for you, consider destroying 
entire civilizations at the touch of a button with DefCon (www.ambrosiasw.
com), a game in which you play the role of a general in control of a nuclear 
arsenal. (See Figure 5-5.) Launch nuclear missiles at your enemies and see 
how much faster you can destroy the planet by using atomic weapons rather 
than diplomacy. 
In case you’d rather save the planet than destroy it (which pretty much 
rules out any chance you might have for becoming a dictator), play Global 
Warning (available at www.midoritech.com). By playing the game, you 
can see how your actions can help save the planet both in the make-believe 
world inside your Mac and in the real world outside your window. 
Rather than play a strategy game that you’ve never heard of, you might 
prefer playing a game that you already know how to play. If you like Stratego, 
buy WebStratego (www.metaforge.net), which lets you play against 
people from all over the world by way of the World Wide Web. If you like 
playing Risk, try taking over the world with a computer version called Lux 
Delux (http://sillysoft.net).

DefCon lets 
you conquer 
the world by 
deploying 
thermo­
nuclear 
weapons.
	
One of the more unique strategy games is Bridge Construction Set (www.
garagegames.com), where you attempt to design a bridge that can hold up 
a train. Design the bridge correctly, and the train crosses safely. Design the 
bridge poorly, and the train crashes into the river below. By teaching you 
how to build a bridge, this game indirectly teaches physics at the same time.
You can play most games by using the key­
board and the mouse. However, arcade-style 
video games can be much clumsier to play. 
Trying to fly an F-16 jet fighter simulator with 
the keyboard can seem unnatural and confus­
ing, so that’s why many companies sell special 
game-playing accessories, such as joysticks, 
steering wheels, and even special mice 
designed to put more controls at your fingertips 
than a traditional mouse.
If you want to play a flight simulator or a first-
person shooter game, you’ll probably want a 
joystick. If you want to play a racing simula­
tor, you’ll probably want a steering wheel and 
pedals. If playing realistic games is important 
to you and you’re in the market for a new Mac, 
consider buying Apple’s top-of-the line Mac 
Pro desktop, which boasts the most powerful 
graphics processor available among Apple’s 
lineup of Mac computer models.
Some popular companies that make game-
playing accessories include TrustMaster 
(www.thrustmaster.com), CH Products 
(www.chproducts.com), and Logitech 
(www.logitech.com). With the right joy­
stick or steering wheel, you can immerse your­
self in your favorite driving or flying simulation 
game and leave the real world behind (until, of 
course, someone from the real world reminds 
you to pay your electricity bill).

Head on down to the arcade Long before video games appeared in coin-
operated arcades, people used to play pinball. Although pinball machines 
have faded into obscurity, that doesn’t mean you can’t still play them on 
your Mac. (It’s just that tilting your Mac won’t help boost your score any.)
For an electronic version of a pinball game, visit LittleWing Pinball (www.
littlewingpinball.com). These pinball games let you shake, rattle 
and roll a virtual pinball machine to achieve the ultimate title of a self-
proclaimed Pinball Wizard.
Pinball machines may be ancient history for today’s generation of gamers. 
Instead, they might prefer arcade games that originated with Pong, Space 
Invaders, Asteroids, and Pac-Man. The goal of these games was simple: Use 
your reflexes to stay alive as long as possible in order to rack up the highest 
score possible.
For a free Pac-Man clone, download a copy of Pac the Man X (www.mcsebi.
com). If you remember playing Frogger, trying to navigate a frog across a 
busy highway without being squished, you can relive your childhood by 
playing the Christmas Super Frog (www.koingosw.com), which is like 
Frogger but with a Christmas theme. If you remember trying to save cities 
from nuclear missiles with Missile Command, you can download a free 
Missile Command clone (http://iskub.sippan.se/missile) and see 
whether you still have what it takes to protect the world from a nuclear 
Armageddon.
Growing beyond the primitive two-dimensional graphics of the early arcade 
games, the latest computer arcade games employ ultra-sharp and often life­
like three-dimensional graphics for use in first-person shooter games and 
sports simulations.
First-person shooter games typically give you the view of a soldier running 
through a maze or rough terrain, blasting away targets and trying to avoid 
being shot in return. For a free first-person shooter game, grab a copy of 
AssaultCube (http://assault.cubers.net), which lets you play with 
others to roam around buildings and gun each other down (virtually speak­
ing, of course). 
For a contemporary first-person shooter game, check out the highly deco­
rated Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (www.aspyr.com), which plunges you 
into the midst of intense, up-to-the-minute action to see whether you can 
survive. If you’d rather play a flight simulator and dogfight other planes, buy 
a copy of OSX Skyfighters 1945 (www.donsgames.com) and strap yourself 
into the virtual cockpit of a P-51, Fw-190, Hellcat, or Japanese Zero and see if 
you can become an ace.

If the idea of killing even virtual enemies makes you squeamish, try to win 
a battle of wits and skill by playing a sports simulation game instead. Take 
a swing at GL Golf (http://nuclearnova.com) to practice your putting 
and golf strokes on days it’s raining outside when hitting the real golf course 
isn’t in the cards. If playing 18 holes sounds too exhausting, conquer a min­
iature golf course by playing Wacky Mini Golf (www.danlabgames.com), 
complete with those pesky windmills blocking the putting green. If you think 
that your game is good enough to play with the pros, take on Tiger Woods in 
Tiger Woods PGA Tour (www.aspyr.com) and see whether your golf skills 
match up with the masters.
In case golf doesn’t get your adrenaline pumping, jump into a race car and 
run your opponents off the track in Jammin’ Racer (www.danlabgames.
com). For a more realistic racing simulation, grab a free copy of VDrift 
(http://vdrift.net), which lets you simulate racing on tracks in Detroit, 
Le Mans, Monaco, and Barcelona, as shown in Figure 5-6. If the idea of play­
ing a motocross simulation gets your motor revving, download a free copy of 
X-Moto (http://xmoto.sourceforge.net) and take out your road rage 
on animated opponents. 
	
Figure 5-6:

you drive

To play football without being whupped on the playing field, try PlayMaker 
Football (http://playmaker.com). To play table tennis and test your 
meanest serve against virtual opponents, try Table Tennis Pro (www.grass
games.com). For a snowboarding simulation, check out Slope Rider (www.
monteboyd.com) — but if you’d rather control a penguin sliding down a 
snow-covered slope, try the free Tux Racer (http://tuxracer.source

No matter what type of game you want, you can typically find one that runs 
on your Mac. If you want to play a game that runs only on Windows, install 
a copy of Windows on your Mac by using Boot Camp (see Book VII, Chapter 
3) and turn your Mac into a game-playing PC. By adding the capability to 
play games designed for Windows, you instantly open your Mac to a wider 
variety of available games — which means your only limitation is finding the 
time to play all the games you want.
Playing multiplayer, online role-playing games
After a while, playing even the most exciting game by yourself can get 
boring, which is why many people prefer playing games online and compet­
ing against others. Such an online experience can give people a sense 
of community, even if you never actually meet in person because the people 
you’re playing with live halfway around the world. One of the most popular 
online role-playing games is the World of Warcraft (www.worldof
warcraft.com), a fantasy virtual world that lets you create an animated 
character called an avatar and roam around bartering, negotiating, and 
attacking other players or mythical creatures with a sword or a magic spell. 
With tens of millions of players worldwide, no session of World of Warcraft 
is ever the same. 
If you enjoy playing games, perhaps you dream 
of creating your own games. Although writing 
your own game might seem scary, you can get 
a lot of help by buying various tools to make 
game creation easier. 
To create simple games, check out the 
GameMaker (http://www.macgame
creator.com), which allows you to create 
adventure games with graphics, buttons, and 
text.
To create simple 2D graphics, such as card 
games or board games, consider purchas­
ing Revolution Media (www.runrev.com). 
If you want to develop more sophisticated 
games, you’ll have to learn a programming lan­
guage, such as C++.
Although you can create an entire game from 
scratch by using any programming language, 
such as C++, even the professionals don’t do 
that. To speed up game development, the pro­
fessionals use a game engine, which contains 
programming code modules for animating 
objects on the screen. By using a game engine, 
programmers can focus on writing the com­
mands to make their game work rather than 
spending time reinventing the wheel when it 
comes to displaying and manipulating graph­
ics on the screen.
Some popular game engines include the 
Torque Game Engine (www.garagegames.
com), Unity Game Engine (www.unity3d.
com), and the PTK Game Engine (http://
www.phelios.com/ptk). By combining 
these game engines with the C++ programming 
language, you can create games the same way 
professional developers do.
Writing your own games

Although some people like fantasy worlds, others prefer science fiction sce­
narios. If you’d rather use a laser blaster than a sword to conquer universes 
instead of castles, consider EVE Online (www.eve-online.com). Play EVE 
Online and you can roam through outer space, shoot at spaceships, trade 
with other planets, and negotiate with aliens (who might not be any more 
bizarre than the people you normally associate with at work). Who knows, 
you just may wind up taking over a galaxy while mere mortals on this planet 
remain ignorant of your true accomplishments and abilities.
If battling for victory in a virtual world of fantasy or science fiction doesn’t 
appeal to you, you might prefer Second Life (www.secondlife.com), which 
puts you inside a virtual world similar to the real world. The only difference 
is that inside this virtual world, you can experiment with different ways of 
living that you might never do in real life, like playing different genders or 
acting aggressive (if you’re normally shy) or making yourself ugly (if you’re 
normally attractive). Second Life also offers a special Teen Life area so teen­
agers can explore the virtual world within a safe environment with other 
teenagers. (Now you just have to worry about the danger of meeting other 
teenagers.) In both Second Life and Teen Life, you create a character (an 
avatar) and roam around interacting with others. You can buy virtual land or 
outfits, start and operate a business, fly in the air over gorgeously rendered 
terrain and seascapes, or just meet new people without the fear of real-life 
rejection.

ou can use a computer all by itself, but to get the most out of your Mac, 
you need an Internet connection. The Internet can also open a whole 
new world for you by letting you browse and read news on the Web, watch 
movies, listen to radio stations, find and download new applications, update 
versions of your existing programs, and shop online. For most people, an 
Internet connection is no longer an option but a necessity.
Setting Up an Internet Connection
From a technical point of view, to connect to the Internet, your Mac must 
connect to another computer, run by a company called an Internet Service 
Provider (ISP); it’s through the ISP that your Mac actually connects to the 
Internet. 
To connect your Mac to an ISP, you have three options:
	
✦	 Ethernet (also called high-speed broadband)
	
✦	 Wireless (also called WiFi high-speed broadband)
	
✦	 Dialup access
Ethernet connection
A broadband Ethernet connection is the fastest way to connect to the 
Internet. The two most common broadband connections are through cable 
modems or DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) modems. 

322
Setting Up an Internet Connection
Your Mac can connect to a cable modem or DSL modem with an Ethernet 
cable, which plugs into the Ethernet port with a plug that looks like a wider 
version of a telephone plug. After you connect your Mac to a cable or DSL 
modem, you can usually start using the Internet right away.
Your Mac can also connect to your broadband modem wirelessly if the 
model you buy (or rent from your cable or phone provider) has a built-in 
WiFi radio, which your Mac’s built-in AirPort WiFi feature can access.
	
When you connect your Mac to a broadband modem using your Mac’s 
Ethernet port, your Mac can recognize the Internet connection right away 
through the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). DHCP means that 
your Mac automatically figures out the proper settings to connect to the 
Internet without you having to type a bunch of cryptic numbers and fiddle 
with confusing technical standards. 
For more information about setting up a network and sharing a single 
Internet connection with multiple computers, see Book VIII, Chapter 1.
Wireless (Wi-Fi) access
Wireless broadband access is popular because it allows you to connect to 
the Internet without stringing cables across the room to trip over. Every new 
and recent Mac comes with a built-in wireless capability called AirPort, but 
if your older Mac doesn’t have this, you can buy a special wireless receiver 
that plugs into your Mac so that it can connect to your home’s WiFi network.
	
If your Mac is so old that it doesn’t have a built-in wireless receiver, check 
out the AfterTheMac wireless adapter (www.afterthemac.com) that plugs 
into a USB port.
After you have wireless access capability in your Mac, you need to connect 
to a wireless network in your home, or out of the house at another location 
if you’re using a MacBook that you can take wherever you go. Public librar­
ies and many coffee houses offer free wireless Internet access. You can set 
up your own wireless network at home or work by using a wireless router 
(which I discuss next) that lets several computers and other WiFi-cable 
gadgets (like video game consoles and iPhones) share a single Internet 
connection. 
Choosing a wireless router
A wireless router connects to your cable or DSL modem and broadcasts radio 
signals to connect your Mac wirelessly to the Internet. Some cable and DSL 
modems come with built-in WiFi transmitters, which means one device does 
the job of two if you choose to use a separate WiFi router to connect to your 
cable or DSL modem.

Setting Up an Internet Connection
Apple sells three wireless router models:
	
✦	 AirPort Express: Small and ideal for small homes, apartments, and dorm 
rooms.
	
✦	 AirPort Extreme: Ideal for homes; 4 Ethernet ports to connect to Macs 
in the same room with an Ethernet cable; a built-in USB port lets you 
connect a printer or hard drive to share wirelessly with other people in 
your house or workplace.
	
✦	 Time Capsule: Same features as AirPort Extreme but also includes a 
built-in hard drive for wirelessly backing up one or more Macs that con­
nect to it.
Apple’s WiFi routers are nice, but you can buy any brand of wireless router 
to connect to your DSL or cable modem and create a home WiFi network. 
The brand name of your wireless router is less important than the speed 
offered by the router, which is determined by the wireless standard the 
router uses. A wireless standard simply defines the wireless signal used to 
connect to the Internet. Table 1-1 lists the different wireless standards. 
Table 1-1	 Wireless Standards and Speeds of Different Routers
Wireless Standard
Speed
Indoor Range
802.11a
Up to 54 Mbps
30 meters (98 feet)
802.11b
Up to 11 Mbps
35 meters (114 feet)
802.11g
Up to 54 Mbps
35 meters (114 feet)
802.11n
Up to 248 Mbps
70 meters (229 feet)
The upload/download speed of wireless standards is measured in mega­
bits per second (Mbps) although this maximum speed is rarely achieved 
in normal use. The speed and range of a wireless Internet connection also 
degrade with distance or if obstacles, such as walls or heavy furniture, stand 
between the WiFi router and your Mac. 
To connect to a wireless network, you need to make sure your router and 
your Mac’s built-in wireless radio (or an external one you buy and connect 
to your Mac) use the same wireless standard. All new and recent Macs con­
nect to WiFi routers that use one or up to all four types of the wireless net­
work standards.
	
The 802.11g wireless standard is the most popular wireless standard, but the 
newer 802.11n standard is becoming more popular because it offers greater 
range and higher speeds. Most routers are compatible with multiple stan­
dards, such as 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g. The newer routers also include 
compatibility with the 802.11n standard.

Setting Up an Internet Connection
Connecting to a WiFi network
If your Mac has wireless capability, you can connect to a wireless network 
(such as at a cafe or a WiFi network in your home) by following these steps:
	
1.	 Click the AirPort icon in the right corner of the menu bar to open a 
pull-down menu displaying a list of any WiFi networks within range of 
your Mac and then select the network name you want to connect to, as 
shown in Figure 1-1.
	
Figure 1-1: 
The AirPort 
icon on 
the menu 
bar opens 
a list of 
nearby WiFi 
networks.
	
AirPort power status
AirPort power control
Signal strength icons
Avaliable networks

	 Note: If you see AirPort: Off AirPort when you click the AirPort icon on 
the menu bar, choose Turn AirPort On and then click the AirPort menu 
icon again to display a list of any nearby wireless networks (refer to 
Figure 1-1).
	
	 If you don’t see the AirPort icon on the menu bar, click Ú and choose 
System Preferences, click the Network icon, and then click the Show 
AirPort Status in Menu Bar check box.
	
	 The signal strength icon next to a WiFi network name shows how 
strongly you’re receiving that network router’s wireless signal (stronger 
signal strength means faster, more reliable connections).
 	
	 A lock icon to the left of the network’s signal strength indicates a secured 
(also known as encrypted) wireless network that is protected by a pass­
word. You must know what password to enter when prompted if you try 
to connect to a secured network. 
	
2.	 If a dialog appears indicating the network you selected requires a 
password to connect to it, as shown in Figure 1-2, type the password 
and then click OK.

Figure 1-2: 
Secure WiFi

them.
	
	
3.	 (Optional) Check the following options on the password dialog prompt 
if you want to:
 
• Show Password: Displays actual characters you type rather than dots 
that hide your password in case anyone is looking over your shoulder.
 
• Remember This Network: Remembers you connected to the selected 
network and automatically connects to it whenever you’re within 
range of its signal. (If you’ve chosen to remember more than one 
wireless network, AirPort always connects to the one with the stron­
gest signal first.)
	
4.	 The AirPort icon on the menu bar shows black bars to indicate the 
strength of the WiFi network signal your Mac is connected to — as 
with mobile phone reception and gold, more bars are better.
	
	 You’re now free to choose any activity that requires an Internet connec­
tion, such as running Safari to browse the news on the New York Times 
Web site (www.nytimes.com), or launching iChat to partake in a text 
chat with a friend who’s also connected to the Internet and signed in to 
their particular chat program.
	
When you connect to a wireless network that doesn’t require you to enter a 
password, your Mac essentially broadcasts any information you type (such 
as credit card numbers or passwords) through the airwaves. Although the 
likelihood of anyone actually monitoring what you’re typing is small, tech-
savvy engineers or hackers can “sniff” wireless signals to monitor or collect 
information flowing through the airwaves. When you connect to a public 
WiFi network, assume that a stranger is peeking at your data. Then only type 
data that you’re comfortable giving away to others. Connecting to a secured 
network that requires you to type a password to connect to it can lessen the 
likelihood that anyone is monitoring or collecting what you’re typing.
Dialup access
Dialup access involves using a telephone and a telephone modem, which 
lets you connect to an ISP and the Internet. Because telephone lines were 
designed for voice communication, dialup connections are terribly slow at 

326
Setting Up an Internet Connection
transferring computer data. With the advent of super-speedy DSL or cable 
broadband Internet access, dialup access is almost obsolete — so old-
fashioned that Apple no longer bothers to include built-in dialup modems 
in Macs.
	
A modem is a device that enables your Mac to connect to the Internet. If a 
cable TV provider provides your broadband Internet connection, you need 
a cable modem. If your broadband Internet connection is the DSL type 
coming into your house through your home’s telephone line, you need a 
DSL modem. If neither DSL nor cable broadband is available where you live, 
or if you haven’t jumped on the high-speed bandwagon for reasons all your 
own, you can still connect to the Internet over your ordinary phone line with 
a slowpoke, dialup data modem. Each type of modem works only with its 
specific type of Internet connection, which means you can’t substitute a tele­
phone modem for a cable modem and expect it to work.
To use dialup access, you need a modem, which plugs into an ordinary tele­
phone line. Because new and recent Macs don’t come with a dialup modem, 
you have to buy a USB external modem from Apple (www.apple.com/
store) or another company. If you have an older Mac, you might have a 
built-in modem. Just peek at your Mac’s lineup of connection ports and look 
for a plug for a telephone jack, which looks almost identical to an Ethernet 
port but slightly smaller. 
	
Dialup access is the slowest way to connect to the Internet. If you have a 
choice, use an Ethernet or wireless connection because you can view Web 
sites much faster. Dialup access will work, but it’s like riding a tricycle down 
a freeway: You’ll eventually get to your destination, but it will take a long 
time.
To connect to the Internet through a telephone line, you need to know 
your ISP’s telephone number, the account name your ISP gave you, and the 
account’s password. The telephone number connects you to the ISP’s com­
puters, but you can’t get access to the Internet unless you also have a valid 
account and password. After the ISP computer verifies that you A) have a 
valid account and B) know the right password, you can access the Internet.
To configure your Mac to use your telephone line to connect to the Internet, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Network icon to 
open the Network preferences pane.
	
2.	 Click the Modem icon in the left pane to open the Modem preferences 
pane.

3.	 Type the account name, password, and telephone number your ISP 
gave you to connect to their computer network into the appropriate 
fields and then click Apply.
	
4.	 Click the Connect button if you want to connect to the Internet now, 
or click the Close button to close the Network preferences pane if you 
want to connect later.
	
	 You can connect to the Internet using your dialup modem at any time 
by repeating Steps 1 and 2 and then clicking the Connect button to make 
the connection.
Browsing Web Sites
After you connect to the Internet (through your Mac’s Ethernet or AirPort 
wireless broadband connections, or using a dialup modem), you can run 
a Web browser program to browse Web sites that interest you. The most 
popular browser for the Mac is the one that comes with it: Safari. Besides 
Safari, you can download and run another Web browser, such as Firefox 
(www.mozilla.com), Google Chrome (www.google.com/chrome), Camino 
(caminobrowser.org), OmniWeb (www.omnigroup.com), or Opera (www.
opera.com).
Setting Safari’s home page
Every time you run Safari, it automatically loads a start page, which is the 
first Web page that you’ll always see. The default start page in Safari is the 
Apple Web site, but you can change your Mac’s home page to whatever you 
want — even a blank page, if that’s what you prefer.
	
Throughout this chapter, all step-by-step instructions are given for Safari. 
Just keep in mind that other browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Camino, and so on) 
work in similar ways.
To define a home page in Safari, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Safari icon in the Dock to run Safari and display the home 
page window.
	
2.	 Choose Safari➪Preferences to open the General preferences pane; 
then type a Web site address, such as www.nytimes.com, as shown in 
Figure 1-3, in the Home Page field.

Figure 1-3: 
Safari’s 
General 
preferences

home page.
	
	
	 If you click the Set to Current Page button, you can make the currently 
displayed Web page your new home page without having to type the 
Web page’s address. To use this feature, visit your favorite Web site 
immediately after Step 1. Then when you click the Set to Current Page 
button, the current Web site address instantly fills in the Home Page 
field as if you typed it yourself.
	
3.	 Click the Close button to close the Safari preferences pane.
Visiting a Web site
Although the first Web site you see will generally be your home page, you 
probably don’t want to stare at your home page all the time. To visit another 
Web site, you use the Web site’s address (also known as a URL, which stands 
for Uniform Resource Locator).
Most Web site addresses, such as http://www.dummies.com, consist of 
several parts:
	
✦	 http://www: Identifies the address as part of the World Wide Web that 
uses the HyperText Transfer Protocol (http). 
	
	 Some Web sites omit the www portion of the name. Other Web sites use 
something else like mobile. Just keep in mind that www is common, but 
not always necessary for many Web site addresses.

Many Web sites in other countries end with a two-letter country address, 
such as .uk for the United Kingdom, .ca for Canada, and .fr for France. 
	
When visiting different Web pages on a site, you might see additional text 
that identifies a specific Web page, such as www.dummies.com/how-to/
computers-software.html or www.apple.com/iphone. 
To visit a Web site by typing its Web site address, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Safari icon in the Dock to run Safari.
	
2.	 Click the address bar and type an address (such as www.dummies.
com), as shown in Figure 1-4, and then press Return.
	
	 Safari displays the Web site corresponding to the address you typed.
	
3.	 (Optional) Click the Navigation buttons if you want to:
 
• Go Back: Takes you to the previous Web page; click again to go back 
another page, and so on, until you wind up on the first page you 
viewed when you launched Safari.

330

• Go Forward: Moves you forward to a page you backed away from; 
click again to advance to the next page you backed away from, and 
so on, until you wind up on the last page you visited before you 
clicked the Back button.
 
• Reload/Stop: Clicking the little arrowed-circle icon on the right 
side of the address bar reloads the current Web page and displays 
any new information that changed since you arrived on the Web 
page (such as breaking news on the New York Times home page, 
for instance). When Safari is loading or reloading a Web page, the 
arrowed-circle turns into an X icon. Clicking the X icon stops Safari 
from loading or reloading the Web page (for example, when you’re 
trying to log in to your banking site but nothing appears on the 
screen when you click the Web site’s login or sign-in button).

If you type a Web site address and see an error message, it might mean one 
of a few things: You typed the Web site address wrong, your Internet con­
nection isn’t working, or the Web site is temporarily (or permanently) 
unavailable.
Searching for Web sites
Typing a Web site address can get tedious, and sometimes you don’t even 
know what Web site you want. That is, you know what kind of information 
you want, just not where to find it.
One way to find a Web site that can contain information of interest to you 
is to use a search engine, which is a behind-the-scenes technology used by 
special Web sites that can look for other Web sites and the information they 
contain based on a word or phrase you enter.
Because search engines are so convenient, Safari (and most other browsers) 
offers a built-in search engine text box in its upper-right corner. By typing a 
word or phrase that describes the kind of Web site or information you want, 
the search engine can find a list of related Web search results (referred to 
as hits or links), that you can click to go to a Web site page containing more 
information about what you’re trying to find.
	
Safari uses the Google search engine. Other browsers, such as Firefox, let 
you choose a different search engine to use.
To search for a Web site that might contain information that you’re looking 
for, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Safari icon in the Dock to run Safari.
	
2.	 Click the Search text box (refer to Figure 1-4), enter a word or phrase, 
and then press Return. 
	
	 The Safari window displays a Web page of Web links Google found based 
on contents that match or relate to the word or phrase you typed, as 
shown in Figure 1-5.
	
3.	 Click the Web site you want to visit.
	
If you mistype a word or phrase, the search engine might offer suggestions 
for the correct spelling and look for Web sites that contain that misspelled 
word or phrase, which probably won’t be the Web site you really want 
to see.

332
Browsing Web Sites
	
Figure 1-5: 
Words or 
phrases you 
search for 
appear as 
Web links in 
a new Web 
page. 
	
	
Every time you type a word or phrase in the Search text box, Safari (and most 
other browsers) saves the last ten words or phrases you searched. If you want 
to search for that same word or phrase later, just click the downward-pointing 
arrow that appears in the left side of the Search text box to display a pull-
down menu. Then click the word or phrase you want to search for again.
Returning to Web site search results with SnapBack
If you search for Web sites and find yourself wandering down a number of 
blind alleys because the Web pages you navigate to aren’t what you’re look­
ing for, the SnapBack feature can catapult you to where you began before 
losing your Web-footed way.
To try out the SnapBack feature, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Search field, type a word or phrase that describes a Web site 
you want to find, and then press Return.
	
	 The Safari window displays a Web page of Web links Google found based 
on contents that match or relate to the word or phrase you typed (refer 
to Figure 1-5).
	
2.	 Click the Web site you want to visit to display its Web page in the 
Safari window.

Searching previously viewed Web sites
If you visit a Web site and find it interesting, you might want to visit it again 
later. Fortunately, Safari stores a list of your previously visited Web sites in 
its History menu for up to one year.
To view a list of the Web sites you visited, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Safari, click History on the menu bar.
	
	 A pull-down menu appears, displaying the most recent Web sites you’ve 
visited. Additionally, the History menu lists the past week’s dates so 
you can view Web sites that you visited several days ago, as shown in 
Figure 1-7.
	
2.	 Choose a Web site to have Safari display your selected site.
You can define how long Safari stores your previously visited Web sites by 
following these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Safari➪Preferences to open the preferences window to open 
the General preferences pane.
	
2.	 Click the Remove History Items pop-up menu and then choose an 
option, such as After One Month or After One Day, as shown in 
Figure 1-8.

Figure 1-7: 
The History 
menu lets 
you revisit 
previously

3.	 Click the Close button to close the Safari preferences pane.
	
Although the History menu only displays the past seven days, you can 
choose History➪Show All History to view a list of all the Web sites you’ve 
visited in the period specified by the Remove History Items pop-up menu in 
the General preferences pane.
	
You might want to choose a shorter period in the Remove History Items 
pop-up menu if you share your Mac with others or if you’re using a friend’s 
Mac and you don’t necessarily want to leave a trail of Web sites you’ve 
recently visited.
Protecting your Web history privacy 
with Private Browsing
You can erase your Web browsing history at any time by choosing 
History➪Clear History.

Figure 1-8:

A more secure way to prevent others from seeing which Web sites you’ve 
recently visited is to turn on Safari’s Private Browsing feature by choosing 
Safari➪Private Browsing. When you choose Private Browsing, the dialog 
shown in Figure 1-9 appears, asking whether you’re sure you want to turn on 
Private Browsing.
	
Figure 1-9: 
Choose 
the Private

tracks. 
	
In a nutshell, turning on the Private Browsing keeps your Web browsing his­
tory usage private by:
	
✦	 Not tracking which Web sites you visited

336
Browsing Web Sites
	
✦	 Removing any files that you downloaded from the Downloads window 
(Window➪Downloads)
	
✦	 Not saving names or passwords that you entered on Web sites
	
✦	 Not saving search words or terms that you entered in the Google 
search box
In other words, the Private Browsing feature gives Safari a case of amnesia 
when you turn it on, making Safari mind its own business until you turn off 
Private Browsing. When Private Browsing is turned off, Safari goes back to 
thoughtfully keeping track of the Web sites you visit and terms you type into 
the Google search box so you can easily return to those sites or searches 
again later.
Using the Top Sites view to display favorite sites
While you browse the Web and go from one site to another to another, 
behind the scenes Safari pays attention to which Web sites you visit most. 
By tracking the Web sites you visit most frequently, Safari can display a 
selection of Top Sites that you can browse through to return to what Safari 
deems to be your favorite Web sites, as shown in Figure 1-10.

a black pushpin icon to reverse the action so that the page stays in 
the Top Sites display and isn’t replaced by a Web site you might visit 
more frequently.

you how to do in the next section.
Using bookmarks
Bookmarks let you store and organize your favorite Web sites into groups, 
such as news sites, book review sites, or gadgets sites. By organizing your 
favorite Web sites into groups, you can quickly find them again. You can 
save and view bookmarks in either the Bookmarks menu or the Bookmarks 
bar, as shown in Figure 1-14:

Bookmarks bar folder
Storing bookmarks on the Bookmarks menu tucks them out of sight. The 
drawback is that you must click the Bookmarks menu to find your book­
marks. 
Storing bookmarks on the Bookmarks bar keeps bookmarks buttons for Web 
sites you visit often visible and within easy access at all times. The drawback 
is that the Bookmarks bar can display only a limited number of bookmark 
buttons that link to your favorite Web sites.
Generally, use the Bookmarks bar for one-click access to your favorite Web 
sites and use the Bookmarks menu to store Web sites that you don’t access 
as often.
	
One way to cram more bookmarks onto the Bookmarks bar is to create a 
folder based on a particular category on the Bookmarks bar, which you can fill 
with more bookmarks related to that particular category (refer to Figure 1-14). 
Clicking a Bookmarks bar folder opens a list of all the bookmarks saved in that 
bookmark folder. For instance, you can create a Lunch Joints folder on the 

Book IV

Bookmarks bar and then bookmark the Web sites of nearby restaurants you 
frequent for lunch inside the folder. Today’s lunch specials are now only two 
clicks away.
	
Bookmarks behave the same whether they appear on the Bookmarks menu 
or on the Bookmarks bar.
By default, Safari comes with several bookmarks already placed on the 
Bookmarks bar. If you’ve saved bookmarks on both the Bookmarks menu 
and Bookmarks bar (see the next subtopic, “Adding bookmarks”), you can 
choose bookmarks from either location (refer to Figure 1-14).
To choose a bookmark on the Bookmarks bar, do either of the following:
	
✦	 Click a bookmark on the Bookmarks bar to view your chosen Web page.
	
✦	 Click a bookmark folder on the Bookmarks bar to view a pull-down menu 
of additional bookmarks or folders. Then click the bookmark you want 
to view.
To choose a bookmark on the Bookmarks menu, click the Bookmarks menu 
and do either of the following: 
	
✦	 Click a bookmark on the Bookmarks menu to view your chosen Web page.
	
✦	 Click a bookmark folder on the Bookmarks menu to view a submenu 
of additional bookmarks or folders. Then click the bookmark you want 
to view.
Adding bookmarks
To bookmark a Web site address in either the menu or the bar, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 In Safari, visit a Web site that you want to store as a bookmark.
	
2.	 Choose Bookmark➪Add Bookmark (or click the plus sign button that 
appears to the left of the address bar) to open the dialog shown in 
Figure 1-15.
	
	 By default, the Name text box displays the current Web page’s title — 
which is typically the main Web site’s name.
	
3.	 (Optional) Type a new name for the bookmark if you don’t want to 
keep the default name.

5.	 Click the Add button.
Deleting bookmarks
After you start saving bookmarks of your favorite Web sites, you might find 
that you have too many bookmarks that you don’t use any more. To delete a 
bookmark, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Safari, choose Bookmarks➪Show All Bookmarks.
	
	 Safari displays a window divided into three panes, as shown in Figure 
1-16. The left pane displays a list of bookmark folders. (Safari treats 
the Bookmarks bar and Bookmarks menu as folders.) The right panes 
display the contents of the currently selected bookmark folder or indi­
vidual bookmark, displaying a Cover Flow thumbnail view in the upper-
right pane, and a list of bookmark folders and individual bookmarks in 
the lower-right pane.
	
2.	 Click the folder in the left pane that contains the bookmark you want 
to delete. 
	
	 The right panes display the contents of your chosen bookmark folder, 
which might include bookmarks and additional folders that contain 
other bookmarks (refer to Figure 1-16).

5.	 Choose Bookmarks➪Hide All Bookmarks (or press Option+Ô+B).
Moving bookmarks and bookmark folders
Your browser saves your bookmarks and bookmark folders in the order you 
create them. However, chances are you want to rearrange your bookmarks 
or bookmark folders and put them in a more logical order. You can move a 
bookmark and bookmark folder by following these steps:

344

	 The right panes display the contents of your chosen bookmark folder.
	
3.	 (Optional) Click the triangle that appears to the left of any folder that 
appears in the lower-right pane to display the contents of the folder.
	
	 You might need to repeat this step several times to find the bookmark 
you want.
	
4.	 Drag and drop the bookmark or bookmark folder you want to move 
onto a folder in the left or right pane.
	
	 Safari moves your chosen bookmark to its new location.
	
5.	 Choose Bookmarks➪Hide All Bookmarks (or press Option+Ô+B).
Storing bookmarks in folders
After you save many bookmarks, you might find that they start to clutter 
the Bookmarks menu or Bookmarks bar. To organize your bookmarks, you 
can store related bookmarks in folders. To create a bookmark folder, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 In Safari, choose Bookmarks➪Show All Bookmarks to display your 
saved bookmarks.
	
2.	 Click Bookmarks Bar or Bookmarks Menu in the left pane to choose a 
location to store your folder.
	
3.	 (Optional) Click the triangle that appears to the left of a folder that 
appears in the lower-right pane to display the contents of the folder.
	
4.	 Click any bookmark or a specific bookmark folder in the right pane.
	
	 When you create a bookmark folder, it appears inside the same folder 
that holds the bookmark or folder you click in this step.
	
5.	 Choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark Folder, or click the plus sign 
button in the bottom corner of the left or right pane, depending on 
where you’ll store your new folder.
	
	 An untitled bookmark folder appears.
	
6.	 Type a descriptive name for your bookmark folder in the text field 
and then press Return.
	
7.	 Choose Bookmarks➪Hide All Bookmarks (or press Option+Ô+B).
	
After you create a bookmark folder, you can copy or move existing book­
marks into that folder, or move the folder into another folder.

Importing and exporting bookmarks
After you collect and organize bookmarks, you might become dependent 
on your bookmarks to help you navigate the Web. Fortunately, if you ever 
want to switch browsers, you can export bookmarks from one browser and 
import them into another browser.
To export bookmarks from Safari, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 In Safari, choose File➪Export Bookmarks to open the Export 
Bookmarks dialog, as shown in Figure 1-17.
	
Figure 1-17: 
You can 
give your 
exported 
bookmarks 
a 
descriptive 
name and 
choose a 
location to 
store them.
	
	
2.	 (Optional) Type a descriptive name for your bookmarks if you don’t 
want to keep the default, Safari Bookmarks.
	
3.	 Click the Where pop-up menu to choose where you want to store your 
exported bookmarks file.
	
	 If you click the Arrow button that appears to the right of the Save As text 
box, a window appears displaying all the drives and folders that you can 
choose to store your bookmarks.
	
4.	 Click Save.
After you export bookmarks from one browser, it’s usually a snap to import 
them into a second browser. To import bookmarks into Safari, follow these 
steps: 
	
1.	 In Safari, choose File➪Import Bookmarks to open the Import 
Bookmarks dialog (shown in Figure 1-18) and navigate to the folder 
where the exported bookmarks file is stored.

346
Browsing Web Sites
	
Figure 1-18: 
Safari can 
import 
bookmarks 
that another 
browser 
exported.
	
	
2.	 Click the bookmark file you want to use and click the Import button.
	
	 Your imported bookmarks appear in an Imported folder that includes the 
date you imported the folder. At this point, you can move this folder or its 
contents to the Bookmarks bar or Bookmarks menu to organize them (see 
the previous section, “Moving bookmarks and bookmark folders).
Using tabbed browsing
One problem with browsing Web sites is that you might want to keep track 
of more than one Web site while browsing a second, third, or fourth site. 
Although you could open two separate browser windows, Safari and most 
other browsers offer a handy tabbed browsing feature. Essentially, tabbed 
browsing lets you easily jump around among multiple Web pages in a single 
window — all you have to do is click the tab associated with the Web page. 
(See Figure 1-19.)
Creating new tabs
When you load Safari, you see a single Web page displayed. To create a tab, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪New Tab (or press Ô+T) to open a new tabbed window.
	
2.	 Click a bookmark (or type a Web site address into the address bar and 
then press Return) to display your chosen Web page in your new tab.

Figure 1-19: 
Tabbed

Managing tabs
When you open three, four, or fifteen tabbed windows, you can do things 
such as rearrange the way they are ordered, close tabs, and save a group 
of tabs as a bookmark that you can reopen all at once with a single click of 
your mouse, just to name a few.
	
Some cool things you can try doing with tabbed windows include:
	
✦	 Add a new tab by clicking the plus sign at the far right of the Tab bar (or 
pressing Ô+T).
	
✦	 Switch from tab to tab by pressing Ô+Shift+→ or Ô+Shift+←.
	
✦	 Close a tab by moving your mouse over the tab and then clicking the 
Close icon that appears (or press Ô+W). You can also Control-click a tab 
and then choose Close Tab, or Close Other Tabs.
	
✦	 Rearrange the order of your tabs by dragging and dropping a tab to the 
left or right of another tab.

348
Browsing Web Sites
	
✦	 Move a tab to a new window by dragging it below the Tab bar and then 
letting go of your mouse button, or by Control-clicking a tab and then 
choosing Move Tab to New Window.
	
✦	 Save your collection of every currently loaded tabbed window as a book­
mark by Control-clicking any tab and then choosing Add Bookmark for 
These Tabs.
	
✦	 Merge a bunch of open Web page windows into a single Web page 
with tabs for each of the windows by choosing Windows➪Merge All 
Windows.
	
✦	 View tabs that get shoved off the row of visible tabs when you’ve 
opened too many tabs to display them all by clicking the double right-
pointing arrows on the rightmost tab, as shown in Figure 1-20.

Capturing Web Clips
Rather than view an entire Web page, you might really care about only a cer­
tain part of a Web page that’s frequently updated, such as status updates on 
such social networking sites as Twitter or Facebook, traffic reports on local 
highways, or breaking news. Fortunately, Safari lets you copy part of a Web 
page and store it as a Dashboard widget called a Web Clip.
	
Dashboard widgets are programs that perform a single task and pop up 
whenever you press the Dashboard key (also labeled F4 on recent and new 
Mac keyboards) or press Fn+F12. You find out more about Dashboard wid­
gets in Book II, Chapter 1.

Creating a Web Clip
To create a Web Clip, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Safari, go to the Web page you’re interested in and then choose 
File➪Open in Dashboard.
	
	 The Web page darkens and highlights a portion of the currently dis­
played Web page.
	
2.	 Move your pointer over the part of the Web page that you want to 
view as a Dashboard widget and then click the mouse to create a 
selection box, as shown in Figure 1-21.
	
3.	 (Optional) Click one of the selection box handles surrounding the 
selection box and then drag your mouse to make the box bigger or 
smaller around the section of information you want to capture.
	
4.	 Click the Add button in the upper-right corner to save your Web Clip 
as a Dashboard widget.
	
	 Dashboard automatically opens and displays your newly created Web 
Clip widget, as shown in Figure 1-22.

pointer over the widget you want to delete, and then click the Close button 
that appears in the upper-left corner. Adios, Web Clip.
Search for text on a Web page
One quick way to skim a Web page is to search for specific words or phrases 
to find what you’re looking for. A more focused approach is to search for 
specific text, which you can do by using Safari’s Find feature.
The Find feature not only finds multiple instances of a word or phrase, but 
also highlights them on the Web page to make them easier to see. To search 
for text on a Web page, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Safari, go to a Web page that you want to search.
	
2.	 Choose Edit➪Find➪Find (or press Ô+F).
	
	 A Find bar (with text box) appears at the top of the Web page, ready for 
you to type your word or phrase.

Saving and Sharing Web Pages
	
3.	 Type a word or phrase in the Find bar’s text box.
	
	 The Find bar lists how many matches it finds in the currently displayed 
Web page and Safari highlights each match and selects the first instance, 
as shown in Figure 1-23.
	
Figure 1-23: 
Safari 
highlights 
each match 
in a box.
	
	
4.	 Click the Next (or Previous) button to view the next (or previous) 
instance of the searched term.
	
	 If Safari can’t find another match, it simply starts highlighting the previ­
ous words or phrases.
	
5.	 Click the Done button in the Find bar when you finish searching 
through the text (or press Escape).
Saving and Sharing Web Pages
When you come upon a Web page containing a story or a recipe that you 
want to share with friends, you can save, print, or e-mail the Web page to 
your friends so they can have a look at what you find so interesting.

352
Saving and Sharing Web Pages
Saving a Web page as a file
When you save a Web page as a file, you store the complete text and graph­
ics of that Web page as a file on your Mac’s hard drive. Safari gives you two 
ways to save a Web page:
	
✦	 As a Web Archive: A Web archive is meant for viewing a Web page only 
in the Safari browser. Saving a Web page as an HTML source file lets you 
view and edit that file in any browser or Web page authoring program — 
which is helpful if you want to figure out how someone designed that par­
ticular Web page.
	
✦	 As an HTML Source File (called Page Source): If you view a Web page 
saved as Page Source, you won’t see any of the graphics, but you will see 
text references to the graphics and each one’s associated URL address.
	
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which is a special language 
used to design the layout of all Web pages. 
To save a Web page as a file, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Safari, find the Web page that you want to save and then choose 
File➪Save As to open the Save As dialog, as shown in Figure 1-24.
	
Figure 1-24: 
The Save As 
dialog lets 
you choose 
where and 
how to save 
a file.
	
	
2.	 (Optional) Type a new descriptive name in the Export As field if you 
don’t want to keep the one Safari automatically fills in for you.
	
3.	 Click the Where pop-up menu and then choose where you want to 
store your file on your Mac’s hard drive.
	
	 If you click the Expand (downward-pointing arrow) button to the right of 
the Export As field, the Save As dialog expands to let you choose more 
folders to store your file.
	
4.	 Click the Format pop-up menu, choose Web Archive or Page Source, 
and then click Save.

Saving and Sharing Web Pages
	
After you save a file as a Web Archive or a Page Source, you can view it by 
double-clicking the file icon in the folder where you saved the Web Archive 
or Page Source file.
	
Only Safari can view a Web Archive file, but any browser can view a Page 
Source file.
Printing a Web page
Rather than save a Web page as a file, you might just want to print it instead. 
To print a Web page, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Safari, find the Web page you want to print and choose File➪Print 
to open the Print dialog.
	
2.	 Click the Printer pop-up menu and then choose the printer to use.
	
	 If you click the PDF button, you can save your Web page as a PDF file. 
If you click the Expand button (downward-pointing arrow) to the right 
of the Printer pop-up menu, the Print dialog expands to let you select 
which pages to print and other print-related options.
	
3.	 Click Print.
Sending a Web page by e-mail
After saving a Web page as a separate file, you can then attach that file to an 
e-mail message to send it to a friend. An easier way to send a Web page to 
one or more people is to send the Web page in an e-mail message, as shown 
in Figure 1-25. (You can also just send a link to the Web page rather than the 
entire Web page itself.)
	
The main advantage of sending a Web page link is that it doesn’t take as 
much space as sending the actual Web page.
To send a Web page (or just a link to a Web page) in an e-mail message, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Safari, click the File menu and then choose one of these options:
 
• Mail Contents of This Page: To send the entire Web page in an e-mail 
message.
 
• Mail Link to This Page: To send a link to the Web page that the recipi­
ent can click to open the Web page with his or her Web browser.
	
	 The Mail program loads and opens a new e-mail message containing 
your Web page or your Web page link, depending on which command 
you select.

354
Viewing and Playing Multimedia Files
	
2.	 In the To: field that’s automatically selected, type the e-mail address 
(or addresses) of the person that you want to send the Web page to 
and then click the Send button.
	
	 The Mail program sends your e-mail message.
	
Figure 1-25: 
Sending a 
Web page

message 
displays that 
Web page

text box.
	
	
If you send a link to a Web page and that Web page or Web site is changed or 
is no longer available, anyone who clicks the link will see an error message 
instead of the Web page you wanted him or her to see.
Viewing and Playing Multimedia Files
The most basic Web pages consist of mainly text and sometimes graphics. 
However, most Web sites offer robust content beyond simple words and pic­
tures, including content stored as video, audio, and other types of common 
files, such as PDF (Portable Document Format) files. Although your Mac 
includes many programs for viewing and listening to video, audio, and PDF 
files, you might still need additional software to view some Web sites. 
Watching video
Many news sites offer videos that require Windows Media Player or 
RealPlayer.

Viewing and Playing Multimedia Files
To download the necessary program so you can play Windows Media 
video content, go to www.microsoft.com/mac/products/flip4mac.
mspx. Microsoft actually gives you two choices. First, you can download the 
Windows Media Player for the Mac. However, Microsoft has stopped devel­
oping this program, so as a second choice, Microsoft offers a free program 
called Flip4Mac.
	
Some Web sites won’t work unless you’re using Microsoft Windows. In this 
case, you might need to run Windows on your Mac with one of the programs 
described in Book VII, Chapter 3.
The Flip4Mac program allows the QuickTime Player that comes with your 
Mac to play most video files designed to run with the Windows Media Player.
Besides downloading and installing the Flip4Mac program, you should also 
download and install the RealPlayer program (www.real.com). After you 
have both Flip4Mac and RealPlayer installed, you should be able to watch 
videos on most every Web site you visit.
Listening to streaming audio
Many Web sites offer audio that you can listen to, such as live interviews 
or radio shows. Such audio is often stored as streaming audio, which means 
your computer downloads a temporary audio file and begins playing it 
almost instantly but doesn’t actually save the radio program as a file on your 
hard drive.
Sometimes you can listen to streaming audio through the iTunes program, 
sometimes you need a copy of Windows Media Player (or Flip4Mac), and some­
times you need a copy of RealPlayer.
Viewing PDF files
Some Web sites offer downloadable documents, booklets, brochures, eBook 
editions of New York Times best-selling non-fiction and fiction titles, and 
user guides as a PDF (Portable Document Format) file, which is a special file 
format for storing the layout of text and graphics so they appear exactly the 
same on different computers. If a Web site offers a PDF file as a link you can 
click to open, you can view and scroll through it directly within Safari.
You can save a PDF document you’re viewing to look at it later by clicking 
the document displayed in the Safari Web browser window and then choos­
ing File➪Save As. If you double-click a PDF file icon, you can view the con­
tents of that PDF file by using the Preview program included with every Mac.

356
Downloading Files
	
You can also view PDF files by using the Adobe Reader program — a free 
download from Adobe (www.adobe.com) — which offers the basic features 
of the Preview program plus extra features for opening and viewing PDF 
documents. If you have problems printing certain PDF files with the Preview 
program, try printing them with the Adobe Reader program instead.
Downloading Files
Part of the Web’s appeal is that you can find interesting content — music 
tracks, or free demos of programs you can try before you buy, for example — 
that you can download and install on your own computer. (When you copy 
a file from the Web and store it on your computer, that’s downloading. When 
you copy a file from your computer to a Web site — such as your electronic 
tax forms that you file electronically on the IRS’s Web site — that’s uploading.)
	
Only download a file if you trust the source. If you visit an unknown Web 
site, that unknown Web site might be trying to trick you into downloading 
a file that could do harmful things to your Mac, such as delete files, spy on 
your activities, or even bombard you with unwanted ads, so be careful. To 
learn about ways you can protect your Mac (and yourself) from potentially 
dangerous Internet threats, take a look at Book IV, Chapter 4.
To download a file, click a link or button on a Web site that offers down­
loadable content, such as MacUpdate (www.macupdate.com), or Apple’s 
Downloads Web page (www.apple.com/downloads). When you find a file 
you want to download, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 Click the Download link or button to begin downloading the file you 
want to save on your Mac’s hard drive. 
	
	 The Downloads window appears, showing the name of the file you’re 
downloading and approximately how much time remains until the down­
load completes, as shown in Figure 1-26.

S
ending and receiving e-mail is one of the most popular uses for the 
Internet. E-mail is fast, (almost always) free, and accessible to anyone 
with a computer and an Internet connection. 
To send and receive e-mail, you first have to set up an e-mail account. 
The three types of e-mail accounts you can set up are POP (Post Office 
Protocol), IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), and Exchange. 
A POP e-mail account usually transfers (moves) e-mail from the POP server 
computer to your computer. An IMAP or Exchange e-mail account stores 
e-mail on its server, which allows multiple individuals to access their e-mail 
accounts simultaneously. Most individuals have POP accounts, whereas 
many corporations have IMAP or Exchange accounts. 
Setting Up an E-Mail Account
When you have an e-mail account, you often have two choices for reading 
and writing messages:
	
✦	 Through a Web browser, such as Safari or Firefox
	
✦	 Through an e-mail program, such as the Mac’s free Mail program
	
You don’t have to choose between the methods because you can use both — 
an e-mail program on your Mac, and a Web browser on your Mac or on 
another computer, such as at your friend’s house, or in an Internet cafe — 
to access one or more of your e-mail accounts.

360
Setting Up an E-Mail Account
Accessing an e-mail account through a Web browser is simple because 
you don’t need to know how to use another program, and you don’t have 
to worry about knowing the technical details of your e-mail account. The 
drawback is that you need Internet access every time you want to read or 
respond to messages.
Accessing an e-mail account through an e-mail program lets you download 
messages so you can read or respond to them even if you aren’t connected 
to the Internet. (Of course, you won’t be able to send or receive any mes­
sages until you connect to the Internet again.) The drawback of using 
an e-mail program is that you must configure it to work with your e-mail 
account. 
You can use dozens of e-mail programs, but the most popular one is the 
free Mail program that comes with your Mac. If you don’t like Mail, you can 
download and install a free e-mail program, such as Thunderbird (www.
mozilla.com), or buy an e-mail program, such as Eudora (www.eudora.
com), or Microsoft Entourage (www.microsoft.com/mac), which is part of 
the Office 2008 for Mac suite of productivity applications. 
	
If you plan to access your e-mail account only through a browser, such as 
Safari, you can skip this entire chapter because this chapter explains how to 
use Mail.
Gathering your e-mail account information
To make an e-mail program work with your e-mail account, you need to 
gather the following information:
	
✦	 Your username (also called an account name): Typically a descriptive 
name (such as nickyhutsko) or a collection of numbers and symbols 
(such as nickyhutsko09). Your username plus the name of your Internet 
Service Provider (ISP) defines your complete e-mail address, such as 
nickyhutsko@gmail.com.
	
✦	 Your password: Any phrase that you choose to access your account. If 
someone sets up an e-mail account for you, he or she might have already 
assigned a password that you can always change later.
	
✦	 Your e-mail account’s incoming server name: The mail server name of 
the computer that contains your e-mail message is usually a combina­
tion of POP or IMAP and your e-mail account company, such as pop.
acme.com or imap.gmail.com.
	
✦	 Your e-mail account’s outgoing server name: The name of the outgo­
ing mail server that sends your messages to other people. The outgoing 
server name is usually a combination of SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer 
Protocol) and the name of the company that provides your e-mail 
account, such as smtp.gmail.com or smtp.acme.com.

Setting Up an E-Mail Account
	
If you don’t know your account name, password, incoming server name, or 
outgoing server name, ask the company that runs your e-mail account. If for 
some reason you’re unable to find the information, chances are you might 
still be able to set up your e-mail account on your Mac thanks to the Mail 
program’s ability to detect the most popular e-mail account settings, such as 
those for Gmail or Yahoo!.
	
If you subscribe to Apple’s MobileMe service and typed your MobileMe 
account name and password when you completed the Welcome setup pro­
cess, Mail is already configured to access your MobileMe e-mail account.
Configuring your e-mail account 
After you collect the technical information needed to access your e-mail 
account, you need to configure Mail to work with your e-mail account by fol­
lowing these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Mail icon in the Dock to open the Welcome to Mail dialog.
	
	 The Welcome to Mail dialog prompts you to enter your name, e-mail 
address, and password, as shown in Figure 2-1.
	
Figure 2-1: 
The New 
Account 
dialog 
asks for 
your name, 
e-mail 
address, 
and 
password.
	
	
2.	 Enter your full name, e-mail address, and password in the text boxes 
and then click Continue.
	
	 Your full name is any name you want to associate with your messages. 
If you type “Nickycito con Queso” in the Full Name text box, all your 
messages will include “From: Nickycito con Queso.” Your e-mail address 
includes your username plus ISP name, such as nickyhutsko@gmail.
net. Your password might be case-sensitive, so type it exactly.

362
Setting Up an E-Mail Account
	
	 Mail connects to your email account and attempts to fill in your e-mail 
account settings automatically.
	
a.	 If Mail succeeds in detecting your e-mail account’s settings, Mail 
closes the setup dialog and displays your Inbox and you can skip the 
rest of these steps. (Read the rest of these steps if you want to learn 
about additional settings that you can adjust to gain greater control 
over how Mail handles your e-mail.)
	
b.	 If mail doesn’t automatically detect your e-mail account settings, 
continue following these steps to configure Mail to work with your 
e-mail account.
	
3.	 Click Continue.
	
	 An Incoming Mail Server dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-2.
	
Figure 2-2: 
The 
Incoming 
Mail Server 
dialog lets 
you specify 
where to 
retrieve 
your e-mail.
	
	
4.	 Choose your incoming mail server type from the Account Type pop-up 
menu.
	
	 Your choices here include POP, IMAP, Exchange 2007, Exchange 
IMAP, and, if you typed in a @mac.com or @me.com e-mail address, 
MobileMe.
	
5.	 (Optional) Click the Description text box and type a description of 
your account. 
	
	 This description is for your benefit only, so feel free to type anything 
you want. Because you can configure Mail to access two or more e-mail 
accounts, you might want to identify an account as a Work account or a 
Gmail account.

account provider.
	
7.	 Click the User Name text box and type your username.
	
	 Depending on your e-mail account provider, your username may be 
a standalone word or combination of letters and numbers, such as 
“nickyhutsko”, or it may also include the e-mail account provider’s 
Internet domain, such as nickyhutsko@gmail.com or nickyhutsko@
earthlink.net.
	
8.	 Click the Password text box and type your password.
	
	 Your password appears onscreen as a series of dots to keep anyone 
peeking over your shoulder from seeing your password.
	
9.	 Click Continue to display the Outgoing Mail Server dialog, as shown in

ing steps to add one or more additional e-mail accounts. 
Writing E-Mails
After you configure Mail, you can start writing and sending e-mail to anyone 
with an e-mail address. In this section, I describe the three ways to write and 
send an e-mail:
	
✦	 Create a new message from scratch.
	
✦	 Reply to a message you received from someone else.
	
✦	 Forward a message you received from someone else.

Writing E-Mails
Creating a new e-mail
When you write a message to someone for the first time, you have to create 
a new message by following these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, choose File➪New Message (or click the New Message button) 
to open a New Message window.
	
2.	 Click the To text box and type an e-mail address, or just begin typing 
someone’s name you have stored in Address Book to automatically fill 
in that person’s e-mail address.
	
	 You can type multiple e-mail addresses in the To text box by separating 
them with a comma, such as steve@apple.com, bill@microsoft.com.
	
3.	 Click the Subject text box and type a brief description of your message 
for your recipient.
	
4.	 Click the Message text box and type your message.
	
5.	 Click the Send button.
Replying to a message
You’ll often find yourself responding to messages others send to you. When 
you reply to a message, your reply can contain the text that you originally 
received so the recipient can better understand the context of your reply.
	
To reply to a message, you need to receive a message first. To receive 
messages, just click the Get Mail button. You find out more about receiving 
messages later in this chapter. 
To reply to a message, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, click the Inbox icon under the Mailboxes category in the left 
pane of the Mail window.
	
	 The top-right pane lists all the messages stored in your Inbox folder.
	
2.	 Click to select a message in the Inbox that you want to reply to.
	
3.	 Choose Message➪Reply (or click the Reply button, or press Ô+R).
	
	 A new Message window appears with the e-mail address of your recipi­
ent, the subject already entered, and the text of the message so that the 
other person can understand the context of your reply.
	
	 If you’re replying to a message that was sent to you and several other 
people, you can reply to everyone who received the same message by 
choosing Message➪Reply All (or by clicking the Reply All button, or by 
pressing Ô+Shift+R).

366
Writing E-Mails
	
4.	 Click the Message text box and type a message.
	
5.	 Click Send.
Forwarding a message
Sometimes you might receive a message and want to send that message to 
someone else. When you forward (send a copy of) a message, that message 
appears directly in the Message text box, as shown in Figure 2-5.
	
Figure 2-5: 
A forwarded 
message 
appears 
directly 
in the 
Message 
text box.
	
To forward a message, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, click the Inbox icon under the Mailboxes category in the left 
pane of the Mail window.
	
	 The right pane lists all the messages stored in your Inbox folder.
	
2.	 In the Inbox, click to select a message that you want to forward.
	
3.	 Click the Forward button at the top of the Mail window.
	
4.	 Click the To text box and type an e-mail address.
	
5.	 Click Send.
Sending a file attachment
When you send an e-mail, you’re sending text. However, sometimes you 
might want to send pictures, word processor documents, or videos and links 

Book IV 
Chapter 2
Sending and 
Receiving E-Mail
367
Writing E-Mails
to Websites you think others may want to visit. Anyone receiving your mes­
sage and file attachment can then save the file attachment and open it later. 
Because so many people need to share Microsoft Word files or digital photo­
graphs, file attachments are a popular way to share files with others.
	
Your e-mail account may have a maximum file size limit you can send, such 
as 10MB. If you have a file larger than the maximum limit, you might have to 
send your files through a free, separate file-delivery service, such as YouSendIt 
(www.yousendit.com), SendThisFile (www.sendthisfile.com), or 
BigUpload (www.bigupload.com).
To attach a file to a message, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, open a new Message window as described in one of the pre­
ceding sections.
	
	 You can open a new Message window to create a new message, reply to 
an existing message, or forward an existing message.
	
2.	 Choose File➪Attach File (or click the Attach button).
	
	 A dialog appears.
	
3.	 Navigate through the folders to get to the file you want to send and 
then click it.
	
	 To select multiple files, hold down the Ô key and click each file you 
want to send. To select a range of files, hold down the Shift key and click 
the first and last files you want to send.
	
4.	 Click Choose File.
	
5.	 Click Send.
Sending a message to multiple recipients
If you want to send the same message to several people, you can type mul­
tiple e-mail addresses, separated by a comma, in one or more of the follow­
ing fields:
	
✦	 To: The To field is where you type e-mail addresses of people who you 
want to read — and possibly reply to — your message.
	
✦	 Carbon copy (Cc): The Cc field is where you type e-mail addresses of 
people who you want to keep informed, but who don’t necessarily need 
to write a reply.
	
✦	 Blind carbon copy (Bcc): The Bcc field sends a copy of your message to 
e-mail address that you type here, but those e-mail addresses will not be 
visible in the message to the recipients you enter in the To: and Cc: fields.

368
Writing E-Mails
	
When sending out a particularly important message, many people type the 
recipient’s e-mail address in the To field and their own e-mail address in the Cc: 
or Bcc: fields. This way they can verify that their message was sent correctly.
When someone receives an e-mail message, he or she can read all the e-mail 
addresses stored in the To and Carbon copy fields. If you don’t want anyone 
else to know who received your message, use Blind carbon copy. (It’s pos­
sible to use both Carbon copy and Blind carbon copy in the same message.)
Whenever you write a message, the To field is always visible because you 
need to send your message to at least one e-mail address. However, Mail can 
hide and display both the Carbon copy and Blind carbon copy fields because 
you don’t always want or need them in every message you write.
To send multiple copies of the same message as Carbon copy or Blind 
carbon copy, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, open a new Message window as described in one of the pre­
ceding sections.
	
	 You can open a new Message window to create a new message, reply to 
an existing message, or forward an existing message.
	
2.	 (Optional) Choose View➪Cc Address Field if the Cc field isn’t visible.
	
	 A check mark means the Cc text box appears in the new Message 
window.
	
3.	 (Optional) Choose View➪Bcc Address Field if the Bcc field isn’t visible.
	
	 A check mark means the Bcc text box appears in the new Message window.
	
4.	 Click the Cc and/or Bcc text box and type an e-mail address.
	
	 You can type multiple e-mail addresses in the To, Cc, and Bcc text boxes 
by separating each e-mail address with a comma, such as john@yahoo.
com, bill@microsoft.com.
	
5.	 Click Send.
Using e-mail stationery
E-mail stationery consists of graphic designs and formatted text that you 
can edit. By using stationery, you can create e-mail messages that look more 
interesting than plain text. Keep in mind, however, that all of those pretty 
accents increase the size of any e-mail messages you create using stationery.

Picking a stationery design
To use the Mail program’s Stationery feature to create a new message, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, choose File➪New Message (or click the New Message icon) to 
open a New Message window.
	
2.	 Click the Show Stationery button.
	
	 A list of stationery categories (Birthday, Photos, and so on) appears in 
the upper-left pane and a list of stationery designs appears in the upper-
middle of the New Message window, as shown in Figure 2-6.
	
3.	 Click a Stationery category, such as Sentiments or Birthday.
	
	 Each time you click a different category, the Mail window displays a list 
of stationery designs in that category.
	
4.	 Click the stationery design that you want to use.
	
	 Your chosen stationery appears in the main section of the New Message 
window. 
	
5.	 Click any text and edit or type new text.
Modifying photographs in a stationery design
After you choose a stationery design, you can edit the text and replace it 
with your own message. If the stationery displays a photograph, you can 
replace the photograph with another picture stored in iPhoto or somewhere 
else on your hard drive.
To add your own pictures to a stationery design, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Make sure Mail displays a stationery design that includes one or more 
pictures, as shown in top part of Figure 2-7.
	
2.	 Do one of the following actions:
 
• Call up the Finder by clicking the Finder icon in the Dock. (You might 
need to move the Finder and Mail windows so they appear side by side.)
 
• Click the Photo Browser icon. The Photo Browser window appears, 
containing all the photographs you’ve stored in iPhoto.
	
3.	 In either the Finder or the Photo Browser, navigate to the folder that 
contains a photograph that you want to use in your stationery.

Spelling and grammar checking
Although e-mail is considered less formal than other forms of communica­
tion, such as letters or a Last Will and Testament, you probably don’t want 
your e-mail message riddled with spelling errors and typos that can make 
you look like, well, a dummy. That’s why Mail provides a spelling and gram­
mar checker.

To use the built-in spelling and grammar checker, you need to configure it to 
define whether you want it to check while you type or wait until you finish 
typing. 

372
Writing E-Mails
Configuring the spelling and grammar checker
By default, Mail has its spell checker turned on to check misspellings while 
you type. When Mail finds a misspelled word, it underlines the word in red 
so you can Control-click on the underlined word and then choose another 
word from the shortcut menu of best guesses. Or, you can choose Learn 
Spelling from the shortcut menu to add the word to your Mac’s list of cor­
rectly spelled words if your Mac doesn’t already have it in its own list of 
spell checker words. If you find the red underline feature annoying or want 
to turn on the grammar checker, too, you need to configure the spelling and 
grammar checker. If you’re happy with the way the spell checker works, you 
don’t have to configure the spelling and grammar checker at all.
To configure the spelling and grammar checker, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open a new Message window as described earlier in this chapter, then 
click in the Message text box and enter some text or an actual e-mail 
message you want to send.
	
	 You can open a new Message window to create a new message, reply to 
an existing message, or forward an existing message.
	
2.	 Choose Edit➪Spelling and Grammar➪Check Spelling and then choose 
one of the following from the submenu, as shown in Figure 2-8:
 
•	 While Typing: Underlines possible misspellings and grammar prob­
lems while you write.
 
• Before Sending: Spelling and grammar checking of your message 
before it’s sent.
 
•	 Never: Doesn’t perform spelling and grammar checking.

4.	 (Optional) Choose Edit➪Spelling and Grammar➪Correct Spelling 
Automatically if you want Mail to automatically correct words it 
deems incorrect.
Checking spelling and grammar
If you have spell checking turned on while you type, the spell checker will 
underline suspected misspelled words in red to help you find potential prob­
lems easily. If you want to spell check and grammar check your entire mes­
sage, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open a new Message window as described earlier in this chapter.
	
	 You can open a new Message window to create a new message, reply to 
an existing message, or forward an existing message.
	
2.	 Choose Edit➪Spelling and Grammar➪Show Spelling and Grammar.
	
	 The spelling and grammar checker does it thing, with a Spelling and 
Grammar dialog appearing each time Mail finds a potentially misspelled 
word, as shown in Figure 2-9.

3.	 Click one of the following buttons:
 
• Change: Changes the misspelled word with the spelling that you 
choose from the list box on the left.
 
• Find Next: Finds the next occurrence of the same misspelled word.
 
• Ignore: Tells Mail that the word is correct.
 
• Learn: Adds the word to the dictionary.
 
• Define: Launches Mac’s Dictionary program and looks up and dis­
plays the word’s definition in the Dictionary’s main window.
 
• Guess: Offers best-guess word choices.
	
4.	 Click Send.
	
The spelling and grammar checker can’t catch all possible errors (words like 
to and two, or fiend and friend can slip past because the words are spelled 
correctly), so make sure you proofread your message after you finish spell­
ing and grammar checking your message.
Receiving and Reading E-Mail
To receive e-mail, your e-mail program must contact your incoming mail 
server and download the messages to your Mac. Then you can either check 
for new mail manually or have Mail check for new mail automatically.
Retrieving e-mail 
To check and retrieve e-mail manually in Mail, choose Mailbox➪Get New 
Mail (or click the Get Mail icon). The number of new messages appears next 
to the Inbox icon, and in a red circle on the Mail icon in the Dock.
Checking for new e-mail manually can get tedious, so you can configure Mail 
to check for new mail automatically at fixed intervals of time, such as every 
5 or 15 minutes. To configure Mail to check for new messages automatically, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, choose Mail➪Preferences to open the Mail preferences 
window.
	
2.	 Click the General icon to display the General pane, as shown in 
Figure 2-10.

4.	 (Optional) Choose a sound to play when you receive new messages 
from the New Messages Sound pop-up menu.
	
	 You can also choose None in case any sound bothers you.
	
5.	 Click the Close button of the Mail preferences window.
	
Mail can check for new messages only if you leave Mail running. If you quit 
Mail, it can’t check for new messages periodically.
Reading e-mail
After you start receiving e-mail, you can start reading your messages. When 
you receive a new message, Mail flags it with a dot in the Message Status 
column, as shown in Figure 2-11.

Message status column
Preview pane
To read a message, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane. 
	
	 A list of messages stored in the Inbox appears.
	
2.	 Do one of the following:
 
• Click a message and read the message in the Preview pane.
 
• Double-click a message to display and read a message in a separate 
window.
The advantage of the Preview pane is that you can scan your messages 
quickly by clicking each one without having to open a separate window. The 
advantage of reading a message in a separate window is that you can resize 
that window and see more of the message without having to scroll as often 
as you would if you were reading that same message in the Preview pane. 
Viewing and saving file attachments
When you receive a message that has a file attachment, Mail identifies how 
many attachments there are and displays a Save button and a Quick Look 
button, as shown in Figure 2-12.

To save a file attachment, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane. 
	
	 A list of messages stored in the Inbox appears.
	
2.	 Click a message in the right pane.
	
	 If the message has a file attachment, the number of attachments, the 
amount of space they take up, the Save button, and the Quick Look 
button all appear in the message headers that list who sent the message, 
the date sent, and the message subject.
	
	 If the attachment is a picture or video clip, the image or clip will appear 
in the body of the e-mail message (refer to Figure 2-11).
	
3.	 (Optional) Click the Quick Look button (refer to Figure 2-12).
	
	 A window appears, displaying the contents of your file attachment (or 
playing the file if it’s a music or video file). Click the Close box of the 
Quick Look window when you finish looking at its contents.

4.	 Click the Save button, or click and hold down on the Save button to 
display a list of attachments, and then choose either Save All to save 
all attachments, or choose an individual attachment to save it but not 
the others if the e-mail message contains more than one attachment.
	
	 You can also just click and drag attachments from the message body to 
the Desktop or a Finder window. To do so, hold down the Command key 
to select more than one attachment; then click and drag any one of the 
selected attachments to the Desktop or a Finder window.
	
	 Mail saves your attachments into the Downloads folder stored inside 
your Home folder. (You may also access the Downloads folder in the 
Dock, to the left of the Trash icon.)
Storing e-mail addresses
Typing an e-mail address every time you want to send a message can get 
tedious — if you can even remember the address. Fortunately, Mail lets you 
store names and e-mail addresses in the Address Book. Then you can just 
click that person’s name to send a message without typing that person’s 
entire e-mail address.
Adding an e-mail address to the Address Book
When you receive an e-mail from someone you like, you can store that per­
son’s e-mail address in the Address Book by following these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane. 
	
	 A list of messages appears in the top-right pane.
	
2.	 Click to select a message sent by someone whose e-mail address you 
want to save. 
	
3.	 Choose Message➪Add Sender to Address Book. 
	
	 Although nothing appears to happen, your chosen e-mail address is now 
stored in the Address Book. 
	
To view your list of stored names and e-mail addresses, you can open the 
Address Book by choosing Window➪Address Panel.
Retrieving an e-mail address from the Address Book
When you create a new message, you can retrieve an e-mail address from 
your Address Book. To retrieve an e-mail address, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, choose File➪New Message (or click the New Message icon). 
	
	 A New Message window appears.
	
2.	 Click the Address button (or choose Window➪Address Panel). 
	
	 The Addresses window appears, as shown in Figure 2-13.

	 Your chosen e-mail address appears in the To text box. (If you click the 
Cc or Bcc buttons, you can add an e-mail address to the Cc or Bcc text 
boxes, respectively.)
	
5.	 Click the Close button of the Addresses window.
Deleting a name and e-mail address from the Address Book
After you store names and e-mail addresses in your Address Book, you 
might want to delete some of them one day. To delete an e-mail address in 
the Address Book, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Address Book icon in the Dock (or double-click the Address 
Book icon in the Applications folder). 
	
	 The Address Book window appears.
	
2.	 Click the name you want to delete and then press the Delete key.
	
	 A dialog appears asking whether you’re sure that you want to delete the 
address card.
	
3.	 Click Delete.
	
	 The Address Book deletes your chosen name.
	
	 If you accidentally delete a name, you can retrieve it right away by 
choosing Edit➪Undo Delete Record. 
	
4.	 To quit Address Book, choose Address Book➪Quit Address Book or 
press Ô+Q.

Receiving and Reading E-Mail
Deleting messages
After you read a message, you can either leave it in your Inbox or delete it. 
Generally, it’s a good idea to delete messages you won’t need again, such 
as an invitation to somebody’s birthday party back in the summer of 2008. 
By deleting unnecessary messages, you can keep your Inbox organized and 
uncluttered — and if you’re using an IMAP or Exchange account, free up 
space on the mail server where your e-mail messages are stored.
To delete a message, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane. 
	
	 A list of messages stored in the Inbox appears.
	
2.	 Click the message you want to delete.
	
	 To select multiple messages, hold down the Ô key and click additional 
messages. To select a range of messages, hold down the Shift key, click 
the first message to delete, click the last message to delete, and then 
release the Shift key.
	
3.	 Choose Edit➪Delete (or click the Delete button). 
	
Deleting a message doesn’t immediately erase it, but stores it in the Trash 
folder. If you don’t “empty the trash,” you still have the chance to retrieve 
deleted messages, as outlined in the next section.
Retrieving messages from the Trash folder
Each time you delete a message, Mail stores the deleted messages in the 
Trash folder. If you think you deleted a message by mistake, you can retrieve 
it by following these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, click the Trash folder. 
	
	 A list of deleted messages appears.
	
2.	 Click the message you want to retrieve.
	
3.	 Choose Message➪Move To➪Inbox.
	
You can set up Mail to automatically move deleted messages to the trash 
and permanently erase those trashed messages after a month, a week, a day, 
or upon quitting Mail. To configure this option, choose Mail➪Preferences, 
click the Accounts tab, click a mail account in the Accounts column, and 
then click Mailbox Behaviors and adjust the settings for Trash to suit your 
e-mail housekeeping style.
Emptying the Trash folder
Messages stored in the Trash folder continue to take up space, so you 
should periodically empty the Trash folder by following these steps:

Organizing E-Mail
	
1.	 In Mail, choose Mailbox➪Erase Deleted Messages. 
	
	 A submenu appears, listing all the e-mail accounts in Mail.
	
2.	 Choose either In All Accounts (to erase all deleted messages) or the 
name of a specific e-mail account (to erase messages only from that 
particular account).
Organizing E-Mail
To help you manage and organize your e-mail messages, Mail lets you search 
and sort your messages. Searching lets you find specific text stored in a par­
ticular message. Sorting lets you arrange your messages in folders so one 
folder might contain personal messages and a second folder might contain 
business messages. 
Searching through e-mail
To manage your e-mail effectively, you need to be able to search for one 
message (or more) you want to find and view. To search through your e-mail 
for the names of senders or text in a message, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, click the Spotlight text box in the upper-right corner.
	
2.	 Type a word, phrase, or partial phrase that you want to find. 
	
	 When you type, Mail displays a list of messages that match the text 
you’re typing, as shown in Figure 2-14.

3.	 (Optional) Click the buttons above the right pane to narrow your 
search.
	
	 Your options are to search through All Mailboxes or the Inbox, or to 
search only the To, From, or Subject fields, or the Entire Message.
	
4.	 (Optional) Click the Save button in the upper-right corner to open a 
Smart Mailbox window, type in a name for your new Smart Mailbox 
search, choose any options you want to customize your search, and 
then click OK to save your Smart Mailbox search.
	
5.	 Click a message to read it.
Sorting e-mail
You can sort e-mail in ascending or descending order based on different cat­
egories, such as alphabetically by the sender, chronologically by date sent, 
or alphabetically by subject. 
	
The easiest way to sort your e-mail is by clicking a column heading, such as 
From or Subject.
To sort your e-mail, you can also follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, choose View➪Sort By. 
	
	 A submenu appears, as shown in Figure 2-15.
	
Figure 2-15: 
Mail lets 
you sort 
your e-mail 
messages in 
a variety of 
ways.
	
	
2.	 Choose a criteria to sort, such as by Date Sent or Subject. 
	
	 Mail then sorts the e-mail according to your whims.

Organizing E-Mail
Organizing e-mail with mailbox folders
When you receive e-mail, all of your messages are dumped in the Inbox. 
After a while, you might have so many messages stored there that trying to 
find related messages can be nearly impossible. 
To fix this problem, you can create separate folders for organizing your dif­
ferent e-mails. After you create a folder, you can group related messages 
together so you can quickly find them later.
	
One common type of e-mail to organize is junk e-mail, which you can route 
automatically to the Trash folder, as I write in the upcoming “Dealing with 
junk e-mail” section.
Creating a mailbox folder
To create a mailbox folder, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, choose Mailbox➪New Mailbox. 
	
	 A New Mailbox dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-16.
	
Figure 2-16: 
The New 
Mailbox 
dialog lets 
you choose 
a name 
for your 
mailbox 
folder.
	
	
2.	 In the Name text box, type a descriptive name for your mailbox folder 
and then click OK.
	
	 Your mailbox folder appears in the left pane of the Mail window.
Storing messages in a mailbox folder
When you create a mailbox folder, it’s completely empty. To store messages 
in a mailbox folder, you must manually drag those messages to the mailbox 
folder. Dragging physically moves your message from the Inbox folder to 
your mailbox folder.

384
Organizing E-Mail
To move a message to a mailbox folder, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane to view your e-mail messages.
	
2.	 Click a message and drag it to the mailbox folder you want to move it 
to, then release the mouse.
	
	 Your selected message now appears in the mailbox folder.
	
	 If you hold down the Ô key while clicking a message, you can select mul­
tiple messages. If you hold down the Shift key, you can click one mes­
sage and then click another message to select those two messages and 
every message in between.
Deleting a mailbox folder
You can delete a mailbox folder by following these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, click the mailbox folder you want to delete.
	
2.	 Choose Mailbox➪Delete. 
	
	 A dialog box appears, asking whether you’re sure that you want to 
delete your folder.
	
	 When you delete a mailbox folder, you delete all messages stored inside.
	
3.	 Click Delete.
Automatically organizing e-mail 
with smart mailboxes
Mailbox folders can help organize your messages, but you must manually 
drag messages into those folders. To make this process automatic, you can 
use smart mailboxes.
A smart mailbox differs from an ordinary mailbox in two ways: 
	
✦	 A smart mailbox lets you define the type of messages you want to store 
automatically; that way, Mail sorts your messages without any addi­
tional work from you. 
	
✦	 A smart mailbox doesn’t physically contain a message but only a link 
to the actual message, which is still stored in the Inbox folder (or any 
folder that you move it to). Because smart mailboxes don’t physically 
move messages, it’s possible for a single message to have links stored in 
multiple smart mailboxes.
Creating a smart mailbox
To create a smart mailbox, you need to define a name for your smart mail­
box along with the criteria for the types of messages to store in your smart 
mailbox. To create a smart mailbox, follow these steps:

	 Your smart mailbox appears in the left pane of the Mail window. If any 
messages match your defined criteria, you can click your smart mailbox 
icon to see a list of messages.
	
The messages stored in a smart mailbox are just links to the actual messages 
stored in your Inbox folder.
Deleting a smart mailbox
Deleting a smart mailbox doesn’t physically delete any messages because 
a smart mailbox only contains links to existing messages. To delete a smart 
mailbox, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, click the smart mailbox folder you want to delete.
	
2.	 Choose Mailbox➪Delete. 
	
	 A dialog appears, asking whether you’re sure that you want to delete 
your smart mailbox.
	
3.	 Click Delete (or Cancel). 
Automatically organizing e-mail with rules
Smart mailboxes provide links to e-mail messages that physically remain in 
your Inbox folder. However, you might want to physically move a message 
from the Inbox folder to another folder automatically, which you can do by 
defining rules. 

Book IV 
Chapter 2
Sending and 
Receiving E-Mail
387
Organizing E-Mail
The basic idea behind rules is to pick criteria for selecting messages, such 
as all messages from specific e-mail addresses or subject lines that contain 
certain phrases, and route them automatically into a folder.
To create a rule, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Mail➪Preferences to open the Mail preferences window.
	
2.	 Click the Rules icon.
	
	 The Rules window appears, as shown in Figure 2-20.

	 If you click an existing rule (such as the preconfigured News From Apple 
rule shown in Figure 2-20) and click Edit, you can modify an existing rule.
	
3.	 Click Add Rule.
	
	 The Rules window displays pop-up menus for defining a rule, as shown 
in Figure 2-21.

Dealing with Junk E-Mail
Dealing with Junk E-Mail
As soon as you get an e-mail address, you’re going to start receiving junk 
e-mail (or spam), and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. However, Mail 
gives you tools for handling the inevitable flow of junk e-mail so you can 
keep your e-mail account from getting overwhelmed. Two ways to manage 
your junk e-mail are by bouncing junk e-mail back to the sender or by filter­
ing junk e-mail into a special junk folder.
	
Most junk e-mail messages are advertisements trying to sell you various 
products, but some junk e-mail messages are actually scams to trick you into 
visiting bogus Web sites that ask for your credit card number. This form of 
spam is called phishing. Other times, junk e-mail might contain an attach­
ment masquerading as a free program that secretly contains a computer 
virus. Or, a junk e-mail might try to trick you into clicking a Web link that 
downloads and installs a computer virus on your Mac. By filtering out such 
malicious junk e-mail, you can minimize potential threats that can jeopardize 
your Mac’s integrity or your personal information.
Bouncing junk e-mail
When spammers send e-mail, the majority of their messages are sent to 
nonexistent e-mail addresses. When this occurs, the mail server computer 
bounces the message back to the sender so the sender knows that the e-mail 
address is invalid. Then the spammer knows not to waste time sending that 
nonexistent e-mail address any more messages.
Fortunately, you can take advantage of this feature by bouncing unwanted 
messages back to the sender. When you bounce a message back to the 
sender, this bounced message makes it appear as though your e-mail 
address is invalid (when it really isn’t). Then the spammer might remove 
your e-mail address from the mailing list, so you’ll receive less junk e-mail. 
That’s the theory, anyway. In real life, this can work if the spammer sent 
e-mail from a valid e-mail address. If the spammer sent junk e-mail through 
another computer (such as one hijacked without the owner’s knowledge), 
bouncing e-mail will never reach the spammer, and your e-mail address will 
continue to receive junk e-mail.
Although not perfect, bouncing junk e-mail back to its sender might help 
reduce the amount of junk e-mail in your Inbox. To bounce a message, follow 
these steps: 
	
1.	 In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane. 
	
	 A list of messages appears in the right pane.

390
Dealing with Junk E-Mail
	
2.	 Click a message that you consider junk.
	
3.	 Choose Message➪Bounce. 
	
	 A dialog appears, letting you know that bouncing messages works only if 
your unwanted message came from a valid e-mail address.
	
4.	 Click the Bounce button (or click Cancel). 
	
Bouncing e-mail is more effective when you know the sender’s e-mail 
address is valid, such as bouncing messages sent to you from a former part­
ner or a person who keeps harassing you because you gave their book a 
negative review.
Filtering junk e-mail
More effective than bouncing is filtering. Filtering means that Mail examines 
the content of messages and tries to determine whether the message is junk. 
To improve accuracy, Mail allows you to train it by letting you manually 
identify junk e-mail that its existing rules didn’t catch.
After a few weeks of watching you identify junk e-mail, the Mail program’s 
filters will eventually recognize common junk e-mail so it can route it auto­
matically to a special junk folder. By doing this, Mail can keep your Inbox 
free from most junk e-mail so you can focus on reading the messages that 
matter to you.
To train Mail to recognize junk e-mail, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In Mail, click the Inbox icon in the left pane. 
	
	 A list of messages appears in the right pane.
	
2.	 Click a message that you consider junk.
	
3.	 Click the Junk icon. 
	
	 This tells the Mail program’s filters what you consider junk e-mail.
	
	 4.	 Click the Delete icon at the top of the Mail window. 
	
	 This deletes your chosen message and “trains” Mail to recognize similar 
messages as junk. 
	
Many Web-based e-mail providers — including Google Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, 
and Microsoft Hotmail — have special programs running on their e-mail 
servers that try to sniff out junk e-mail before it has a chance to land in 
your Inbox. Sometimes legitimate e-mail messages can wind up in the junk 
or spam folders those service providers provide for catching potential junk 
e-mail. Log in to your Web-based e-mail account from time to time to check 

Book IV 
Chapter 2
Sending and 
Receiving E-Mail
391
Dealing with Junk E-Mail
whether messages you wanted to receive might have been flagged as junk 
e-mail, click those messages, and then click the Not Junk or Not Spam button 
or option to tell the e-mail service provider’s junk e-mail sniffing program the 
sender of the message is “safe.”
	
Although Mail’s built-in junk e-mail filters can strip away most junk e-mail, 
consider getting a special junk e-mail filter as well. These e-mail filters strip 
out most junk e-mail better than Mail can do, but the Mail program’s filters 
might later catch any junk e-mail that slips past these separate filters, which 
essentially doubles your defenses against junk e-mail. Some popular e-mail 
filters are SpamSieve (http://c-command.com), Purify (www.hendricom.
com), and Personal Antispam (www.intego.com). Spam filters cost money 
and take time to configure, but if your e-mail account is overrun by junk 
e-mail, a separate junk e-mail filter might be your only solution short of get­
ting a new e-mail account.

✓	Chatting via text, audio, and video
✓	Sharing pictures, files, and screens with iChat Theater
✓	Taking a look at other chat programs
T
he idea behind instant messaging is that you can communicate with 
someone over the Internet using text, audio, or even video — and it’s all 
free. (Well, it’s sort of free, when you ignore the fact that you’re paying your 
broadband Internet provider a pretty penny every month so you can access 
the Internet.)
Now you can swap messages with your friends, chat in real time across 
the planet, and even see each other through live video windows while you 
speak. Instant messaging offers another way for you to communicate with 
anyone in the world using an Internet connection and your Mac.
By using your Mac’s iChat program you can conduct basic text chat mes­
sages with others instantly. And iChat also makes integrating live video, 
audio, and sharing files with others you connect to practically as easy as 
chatting over the telephone.
Setting Up an iChat Account
If you have an existing instant messaging chat account with one of the fol­
lowing services, you’re ready to set up iChat and start chatting in a matter 
of minutes. If you don’t have a chat account, you need to set up an account 
with at least one of the following services:
	
✦	 MobileMe: Formerly known as .Mac, you can create a free 60-day trial 
MobileMe account ($99 per year). If you later decide to cancel, you can 
still use your MobileMe account name free with iChat. Former .Mac trial 
users and subscribers who stuck with the service when it changed to 
MobileMe can also use their yourname@mac.com account name with 
iChat. You can sign up for MobileMe at www.apple.com/mobileme.

394
Setting Up an iChat Account
	
✦	 Mac.com: If you don’t want to bother signing up for the MobileMe trial 
offer, you can still get a free iChat account name that ends with @mac.
com. I explain how to do this in Step 3 of the step-by-step directions 
following these bullets.
	
✦	 AOL Instant Messenger (AIM): Available free at www.aim.com, exist­
ing AIM account users and new users are warmly welcome to use their 
account name with iChat.
	
✦	 Google Talk: Got a Google Gmail account? If so, you automatically have 
a Google Talk account, which lets you send and receive text messages or 
conduct video conferences with other Gmail account holders from your 
Gmail Web page (gmail.google.com). Having a Google Gmail account 
also means you can use it to set up iChat to send and receive text mes­
sages and connect with other Gmail account buddies with iChat’s audio 
and video chat, and screen-sharing feature. Google Talk user names end 
with @gmail.com.
	
✦	 Jabber: The original IM service based on XMPP, the open standard for 
instant messaging, you can create a Jabber account by visiting 
register.jabber.org or one of the other public XMPP services, and 
then use your Jabber account, which ends with @jabber.org, to log in 
and start chatting.
To understand which chat accounts can communicate with which other chat 
accounts, check out the nearby sidebar, “Can’t we all just get along?”
You can only use some of iChat’s livelier fea­
tures, like video chatting and screen sharing, 
when you connect to friends using the same 
kind of account as you. That means Mac.com 
and MobileMe account users can send text 
messages and video chat with one another and 
with AIM users, but they cannot conduct video 
chats with Google Talk or Jabber users.
On the other hand, Google Talk accounts act 
as Jabber accounts, and Jabber accounts act 
as Google Talk accounts. That is, Google Talk 
and Jabber account holders running iChat get 
along to take advantage of iChat’s audio and 
video chat, and screen sharing features, in 
addition to text chat.
To get the most from using iChat with friends, 
you want to sign in with an account that 
matches the ones your friends are using. If 
your friends use Google Talk to sign in to iChat 
and you use MobileMe, you might want to 
create a Google Gmail account and add your 
Google Talk account to iChat so you can audio 
chat and video chat with your friends who sign 
in with a Google Talk account name.
To add additional account names to iChat, 
check out the nearby sidebar, “Managing mul­
tiple chat personalities and options.”
Can’t we all just get along?

Setting Up an iChat Account
After you create a chat account, you can set up an iChat account by follow­
ing these steps:
	
1.	 Click the iChat icon in the Dock to launch iChat.
	
	 An iChat welcome window appears.
	
2.	 Click Continue.
	
	 The Account Setup window appears, ready to receive your account type, 
name, and password information, as shown in Figure 3-1.
	
Figure 3-1: 
The iChat 
window 
prompts 
you for your 
account 
information.
	
	
3.	 Click the Account Type pop-up menu and choose your account type.
	
	 Your choices here include MobileMe, Mac.com, AIM, Jabber, and Google 
Talk accounts.
	
	 If you don’t have one of these accounts, choose AIM, MobileMe or Mac.
com in the Account Type pop-up menu, and then click the Get an iChat 
Account button to launch Safari and take you to the service’s Web site 
and new account sign-up form, which you can fill out to create your own 
chat account name.
	
4.	 Type your account username in the first text box.
	
	 The name to the left of the text box changes depending on which 
account type you select in Step 3. In Figure 3-1, the name reads Screen 
Name.
	
5.	 Type your password in the Password text box.

Setting Up and iChat Account
	
6.	 Click Continue to take you to a third iChat window informing you that 
you’ve successfully set up your iChat account and then click Done to 
close the iChat window.
	
7.	 The iChat Buddy List window appears and iChat automatically logs in 
to your account.
	
	 If you sign in using an existing instant messaging account, the iChat Buddy 
List window displays a list of any buddies who are online when you are.
	
If you sign in to iChat using an existing chat account, you can go about your 
merry way and communicate with the friends, family, and coworkers you 
previously added whenever they’re online and you want to get in touch with 
them (or vice versa).
If you’re brand new to instant messaging, setting up a chat account is only 
half the process to using iChat. Your next step is to contact your friends and 
other contacts you want to chat with to exchange instant messaging account 
names. Think of account names as telephone numbers; you can’t call a friend 
without first knowing her phone number, and similarly, you can’t chat with 
someone if you don’t know her account name.
If you have more than one chat account, 
iChat allows you to add, switch between, 
and juggle two or more chat accounts at the 
same time.
To add, change, or delete additional chat 
accounts, choose iChat➪Preferences to open 
the iChat preferences window shown here and 
then click the Accounts tab.

Setting Up and iChat Account
If you’re not brand new to instant messaging, but the instant messaging 
account you use isn’t one that works with iChat, you can install and run 
other chat programs to send and receive instant messages and conduct 
voice and video chats with your buddies who use other chat accounts and 
chat programs. To learn more about the most popular chat accounts and 
programs, check out the “Taking a look at other chat programs” section at 
the end of this chapter.
If, like me, you have more than one chat account, you can add your addi­
tional chat accounts to iChat so you can sign in and display a buddy list for 
each of your chat accounts. To add, manage, or delete more than one iChat 
chat account, check out the nearby sidebar, “Managing multiple chat person­
alities and options.”
Things you can do with the iChat Accounts 
preferences pane include:
	✓	 Click the Add (+) button to add a new chat 
account to iChat; then follow the steps in 
the “Setting Up an iChat Account” section.
	✓	 Click a chat account listed in the Accounts 
column and click the Delete (-) button to 
delete a chat account you no longer want 
to use with iChat.
	✓	 Click a chat account in the Accounts 
column and click the Account Information 
tab to select, deselect, or change the fol­
lowing options:
	✓	 Enable This Account: When selected, 
makes the chat account available to sign 
in to and then displays a buddy list for the 
account.
	✓	 Log In Automatically When iChat Opens: 
When selected, signs in to the chat 
account and displays the account’s buddy 
list when you launch iChat.
	✓	 Allow Multiple Logins for This Account: 
When selected, lets you sign in to your AIM 
chat account with iChat, for instance, and 
sign in to your AIM chat account on AOL’s 
AIM Web site (www.aim.com) at the 
same time. When deselected, iChat (or the 
AIM Web site) detects the chat account is 
signed in on another location and offers 
you the option to sign off in one location or 
keep both signed in at the same time.
	✓	 Description, Screen Name, and Password: 
Click these fields to change the name of 
the chat account, the screen name, or 
the password. (Note: You must sign out of 
your chat account before you can change 
what’s in this trio of fields.)
	✓	 Add New Buddies I Chat with to “Recent 
Buddies”: When selected, iChat updates 
your buddy list with any buddies you chat 
with who aren’t already added.
	✓	 Click Configure AIM Mobile Forwarding 
(AIM, Mac.com, and MobileMe accounts 
only) to launch your Web browser and 
open the AIM Mobile Forwarding Web 
page where you can type your mobile 
phone number to enable it to receive SMS 
text messages when someone sends you a 
text chat message and you’re not signed in 
to iChat.
	✓	 Click the Security tab to enable or disable 
various privacy and security settings, 
which I describe in more detail in the sec­
tion “Accepting (or blocking) chat invi­
tations with privacy levels,” later in this 
chapter.

Setting Up and iChat Account
Storing names in a buddy list
A buddy list lets you store the account names of your friends. Stored names 
automatically appear in your iChat buddy lists whenever your friends log in 
to their particular chat program (which can be a program other than iChat, 
such as AOL Instant Messenger for Mac or Windows, or even a mobile chat 
program running on a smartphone).
To add a name to your buddy list, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the iChat icon in the Dock to launch iChat.
	
	 If you don’t see a Buddy List window, click the Window menu and then 
select the account name you use to sign in to iChat. If you added more 
than one chat account, choose the account name with the buddy list 
you want to display. Repeat the same step to display buddy lists for any 
other chat accounts you added to work with iChat.
	
2.	 Choose Buddies➪Add Buddy, or click the Add (+) button in the lower-
left corner of the iChat Buddy List window and select Add Buddy from 
the pop-up menu.
	
	 A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 3-2.
	
Figure 3-2: 
To add a 
contact to 
your buddy 
list, type 
their chat 
account 
name or 
e-mail 
address.
	
	
3.	 Fill in your buddy’s chat account name and real name.
	
	 You have two ways to do this:
 
• Type your buddy’s account name and real name in the three text boxes 
shown in Figure 3-2. Depending on the chat account your buddy has, 
the account name might be a single word or an e-mail address.
	
	 Filling in your buddy’s first and last name is for your convenience 
only. If you don’t know someone’s first or last name, or if you prefer

to see his chat account name rather than his real name in your 
buddy list, just leave the name fields blank.
 
• Add contacts from your Address Book. Click the down-arrow button next 
to the Last Name field (refer to Figure 3-2) to expand the Add Buddy 
dialog and show your Mac’s Address Book contacts. Use the search 
field or click the scroll arrows — both are visible in Figure 3-3 — to 
locate your buddy’s contact card and then click your buddy’s name to 
select him or her.
	
	 Your buddy’s account name, first name, and last name automatically 
fill in the related fields of the Add Buddy dialog.

Click to scroll through your contacts.
	
4.	 (Optional) Click the column heading to the right of the Name column 
(named AIM in Figure 3-3) to open a pop-up menu that lets you choose 
between displaying contact chat names or e-mail addresses.
	
5.	 (Optional) Click the Add to Group pop-up menu (which only appears 
if more than one group is available), and then choose the group cat­
egory where you want to store your friend’s name, such as Buddies, 
Family, or Co-Workers. 
	
	 You can change which group your buddy appears in at any time.
	
6.	 Click the Add button. 
	
	 Your new buddy appears in your buddy list.

400
Setting Up and iChat Account
	
If you don’t see your newly added buddy (or buddies you previously added) 
in your buddy list, chances are you might have inadvertently chosen an 
iChat option to hide offline buddies from your buddy list. To show offline 
buddies in your buddy list, choose View➪Show Offline Buddies. Conversely, 
if you only want your buddies to appear in the iChat Buddy List window 
when they’re online, choose View➪Show Offline Buddies.
The names of buddies who are online when you’re online appear as normal 
text with an accompanying generic chat icon or a custom icon of your bud­
dy’s choosing (if he uses a custom icon with his chat program). The names 
of buddies who are offline when you’re online appear dimmed on your iChat 
buddy list.
Organizing a buddy list
When you add a name to your buddy list, you have to store it within an 
existing group, such as Buddies, Family, or Co-Workers. If you want, you can 
always move or copy a buddy’s chat account name to a different group or 
even create completely new groups, such as a group of people involved in a 
specific project. For instance, a community recycling team that you organize 
in a group named WeCyclers, or new acquaintances you met at that Jack 
Russell Terriers for National Office conference you recently attended, all of 
whom you can organize in a buddy list group called JRT4NO.
Moving a name to another group
The first time you add a chat name to your buddy list, you might have unin­
tentionally put the name in your Family group when you really want the name 
in the Co-Workers group. To move a name to another group, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the iChat icon in the Applications folder to launch iChat. 
	
	 If you don’t see a buddy list window, click the Window menu and then 
choose the account name you use to sign in to iChat.
	
2.	 Click the triangle to the left of a group name in the buddy list window 
to reveal all the names stored within that group.
	
3.	 Click and drag a name to a new group name and then let go of the 
mouse button to make the name appear in the new group.
	
	 If you hold down the Option key when you drag a name to another 
group, you create a duplicate copy of the name rather than move it from 
one group to the other.

Creating a new group
iChat includes Buddies, Co-Workers, and Family groups, but you might want 
to create new groups of your own. To create a group, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Add (+) button in the bottom-left corner of the Buddy List 
window to open a pop-up menu and then select Add Group, as shown 
in Figure 3-4.
	
Figure 3-4: 
The Add 
button lets 
you add a 
new group 
(or a new 
buddy).
	
	
	 A dialog appears, asking for a group name.
	
2.	 Type a descriptive name for your group in the Enter Group Name text 
box and then click the Add button.
	
	 Your new group appears in the buddy list, ready for you to copy or 
move names into your newly created group.
	
You can rename a group by Control-clicking the group name and choosing 
Rename Group from the shortcut menu that appears.
Sorting names in a buddy list
To customize the appearance of your buddy lists, you can sort the names by 
first or last name alphabetically, by availability, or manually.

402
Setting Up and iChat Account
To sort names in your buddy list, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose View➪Sort Buddies to open a submenu, as shown in Figure 3-5.
	
Figure 3-5: 
The Sort 
Buddies 
submenu 
lets you 
rearrange 
your buddy 
list.
	
	
2.	 Choose one of the following:
 
• By Availability: Groups all buddies who are online and available for 
chatting when you are.
 
• By First Name: Sorts names alphabetically by first name.
 
• By Last Name: Sorts names alphabetically by last name.
 
•	 Manually: Lets you drag names to sort them any which way you want.
Shortening names in a buddy list
iChat can display names as full names (Joe Hutsko), as shortened names 
(Joe), or by nicknames (GadgetJoey). For friends, it might be fun to display 
names based on nicknames, but for business use, you might prefer to stick 
with full or shortened names.
To define how names should appear in your buddy list, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose View➪Buddy Names to open a submenu.
	
2.	 Choose one of the following:
 
• Show Full Names
 
• Show Short Names
 
• Show Handles

Deleting names and groups in a buddy list
Eventually, you might want to prune names from your buddy lists to make it 
easier to keep track of people you actually chat with on a regular basis.
To delete a name from your buddy list, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 In the iChat Buddy List window, click the triangle next to a group to 
display the names in that group.
	
2.	 Click the name you want to delete. 
	
3.	 Choose Buddies➪Remove Buddy (or press the Delete key).
	
	 A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to delete the name.
	
4.	 Click the Delete button (or Cancel if you suddenly change your mind 
before giving your buddy the axe).
Rather than delete names one by one, you can also delete a group and all 
names stored in that group. To delete a group from your buddy list, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 In the iChat Buddy List window, Control-click a group that you want to 
delete to open a shortcut menu.
	
2.	 Choose Delete Group from the shortcut menu.
	
	 A dialog opens asking whether you really want to delete this group and 
all names in the group.
	
3.	 Click Delete (or Cancel).
	
iChat requires at least one buddy list group to exist in order to operate. If 
you delete all but one buddy list group, you cannot delete the remaining 
group. If you don’t like the name of the necessary group you’re stuck with, 
Control-click the group name, choose Rename Group, and then type a name 
that you can live with for your one and only group.
Chatting with Others
After you store your friends in your buddy lists and give your account name 
to others to store in their buddy lists, you’re ready to start chatting. Of 
course, before you can chat, you have to find someone who wants to chat.
You can chat with someone in five ways:
	
✦	 Text: You type messages back and forth to each other.
	
✦	 Audio: You can talk to and hear the other person, much like a telephone.

404
Chatting with Others
	
✦	 Video: You can talk to, hear, and see the other person in a live video 
window.
	
✦	 Screen Sharing: You can talk to and hear the other person while you 
take over her screen, mouse, and keyboard to fill your screen as though 
you’re sitting in front of her computer. Likewise, your chat partner can 
take over your screen and control your keyboard or mouse as if she 
were sitting in front of your computer.
	
	 Screen sharing can be especially handy for helping family members or 
friends solve a problem with their Mac. If you can’t easily travel to the 
person in need, use screen sharing. I show you how in the “Sharing files, 
photos, and screens with buddies” section, later in this chapter.
	
✦	 iChat Theater: You can talk and hear each other while you share a file 
(or files), such as a document, a Keynote presentation, or photos in 
your iPhoto library. The files you want to share appear on your chatting 
partner’s screen. Likewise, if your chatting partner is sharing photos (or 
other files) with you, you see them on your screen.
Anyone on your buddy list can use text chatting because it requires only an 
Internet connection and a keyboard.
To participate in audio chatting, each person needs a microphone and 
speakers or headphones. Most Macs come with a built-in microphone, but 
you might want an external microphone, such as one built into a headset, to 
capture your voice (and hear the other person’s side of the conversation) 
more clearly.
Participating in a video chat with a buddy (or up to ten buddies in a multi­
person video chat) requires a video camera, such as the iSight video camera 
built-in to all new and recent Macs. If your Mac is an older model without a 
video camera (or if you want to connect a different kind of video camera to 
your Mac that has a built-in iSight video camera), you can buy and connect 
an external video camera, such as one of the models offered by Microsoft 
(microsoft.com/hardware), Creative Labs (www.creative.com), or 
Logitech (logitech.com).
	
If your Internet connection is too slow, iChat might refuse to let you start an 
audio or video chat.
Initiating a text chat
To begin a text chat (or any kind of chat) with someone, you must first make 
sure the person is online and available when you are online. The easiest 
way to find someone to chat with is to look at your buddy list. All names 
displayed in the Offline group are people unavailable. All names displayed in 

Book IV 
Chapter 3
Instant Messaging 
and Video Chatting 
with iChat
405
Chatting with Others
other groups, such as Family or Co-Workers, are connected to the Internet 
and might be available for chatting.
	
Someone being connected to the Internet doesn’t necessarily mean that he’s 
in front of his computer and/or wants to chat. So if you find your instant 
messages are falling on deaf ears (or fingertips) and the person is not both­
ering to reply to your messages or chat requests, chances are the buddy 
you’re trying to chat with has gone fishing or is otherwise away from their 
computer.
Starting a text chat
To initiate a chat with someone listed in your buddy list, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Buddy List window, double-click the name of a buddy who is 
online (or click the Text Chat button at the bottom of the buddy list 
window) to open a new chat window, as shown in Figure 3-6.
	
Figure 3-6: 
The chat 
window lets 
you type a 
message in 
the bottom 
text box.
	
	
2.	 Type a message in the text box at the bottom of the chat window and 
press Return to send your message.
	
	 The recipient of your message will see your message, as shown in Figure 
3-7. The recipient can choose to Block, Decline, or Accept your invita­
tion. (I talk more about blocking and accepting invitations in the section 
“Making Yourself Available (or Not) for Chatting,” later in this chapter.) 
If the recipient accepts your invitation to chat, you can start typing mes­
sages back and forth to one another. You type in the lower text box, and 
your dialog with the other person appears in the main text box.

406
Chatting with Others
	
Figure 3-7: 
Your 
invitation 
to chat 
appears 
on the 
recipient’s 
screen.
	
Starting a group text chat
Instead of chatting with a single person, you might want to chat with multi­
ple people at the same time. To create a group text chat, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Hold down the Ô key, click each online buddy’s name in the Buddy 
List window who you want to invite to your group chat, and then 
press the Return key (or click the Text Chat button at the bottom of 
the Buddy List window). 
	
	 A chat window appears (refer to Figure 3-7).
	
2.	 Type a message that you want everyone in the group to see and then 
press Return on your keyboard.
Initiating an audio chat
To initiate an audio chat, everyone needs a microphone and speakers, which 
are standard equipment on every Mac and on most Windows PCs (if that’s 
what the person or people you want to chat with are using). You can initiate 
an audio chat by following these steps:
	
1.	 Click the name of your online buddy in the Buddy List window and 
then click the Audio Chat button at the bottom of the buddy list 
window (or choose Buddies➪Invite to Audio Chat).
	
	 A message appears, informing you that your audio chat invitation is sent 
and that iChat is waiting for a reply, as shown in Figure 3-8.
	
	 If this feature is dimmed, you don’t have a microphone on your Mac 
or you don’t have a fast enough Internet connection to support audio 
chatting.

2.	 When a buddy you invited to an audio chat clicks the Accept button, 
your audio chat begins and you can both start talking as though you 
were speaking over a telephone.
	
You might need to drag the volume slider to adjust the sound level. If you 
click the plus sign button, you can invite another person into your chat. If 
you click the mute button, you can mute your microphone during the audio 
chat in case you need to shout at your dog to stop barking at the cat, or what­
ever else you want to say but don’t want your audio chat partner to hear.
Initiating a video chat
To initiate a video chat, everyone’s Mac needs a microphone and a video 
camera. Most Macs have a built-in iSight video camera, but for Macs without 
a built-in iSight camera, you have two options:
	
✦	 Plug a digital video camcorder into your Mac’s FireWire port (if your 
Mac model has a FireWire port; some don’t).
	
✦	 Buy a USB video camera from Logitech (www.logitech.com), Creative 
Labs (www.creative.com), or Microsoft (www.microsoft.com/
hardware) and plug it into your Mac.
After everyone (up to ten people) has a video camera connected to their 
Macs along with a fast Internet connection (a minimum of 100 Kbps), you 
can participate in a video chat.
	
Possibly, your Mac has a camera and a fast Internet connection, but some­
one you want to connect with in a video chat does not. In that case, you 
might be limited to using an audio or text chat instead.
You can initiate a video chat by following these steps:
	
1.	 Click your online buddy’s name in the buddy list window and then 
click the Video Chat icon to the right of your buddy’s name to send a 

408
Chatting with Others
video chat invitation (or click the Video Chat icon at the bottom of the 
buddy list window, or choose Buddies➪Invite to Video Chat).
	
	 Your invitation is sent, and a video chat window appears, showing how 
you will look to the other person you want to video chat with, as shown 
in Figure 3-9.
	
	 If you don’t see a Video Chat icon next to your buddy’s name in the 
buddy list window, your buddy does not have a video camera built-in or 
connected to their computer. If you see a Video Chat icon next to your 
buddy’s name but it is dimmed, your buddy is currently in a video chat 
with another buddy or group of buddies.
	
Figure 3-9: 
A preview 
window 
appears so 
you can see 
how you 
will look to

2.	 When your buddy accepts your invitation, your buddy’s live video 
fills the video chat window and a small window showing your live 
video appears in a corner of the window, as shown in Figure 3-10.

Using iChat Theater to share files, 
photos, and screens
Some fun things you can try with a selected online buddy (or buddies) 
include sharing a file (such as a document or picture), sharing an album or 
your entire iPhoto images collection, and sharing your screen. If you choose 
to share your screen, you let your buddy control it as though it were her 
screen (or vice versa, if a buddy shares her screen with you).

Making Yourself Available (or Not) for Chatting
Making Yourself Available (or Not) for Chatting
As soon as you connect to the Internet, your Mac broadcasts your availabil­
ity to all the friends in your buddy lists. The moment someone wants to chat 
with you, you’ll see a window.
Chat invitations can be fun to receive, but sometimes they can be distracting 
if you’re trying to get work done and don’t want to stop what you’re doing to 
chat with someone. One thing you can do is change the status description 
others see next to your name in their own buddy lists.
Changing your status description to Away or something that indicates you’re 
not in a chatting mode can discourage others from sending you chat invita­
tions until they see that you’ve set your status to Available again.
Changing your status
To let others know that you’re busy, you can change your status message 
to indicate you’re out to lunch, on the phone, or revising a big book and not 
really in the mood to chat with others unless it’s about something impor­
tant. (Otherwise, you might as well just exit iChat altogether.)
	
Although you change your status to indicate you are away or unavailable to 
chat, you can still receive chat messages and invitations your buddies send 
if they choose to disregard your status message. Therefore, you’ll still need 
to click Accept or Decline for each invitation you receive.
Alternately, you can change your status to make yourself invisible, which 
means you don’t appear in your friends’ Buddy List windows. However, you 
still see your friends in your Buddy List window (unless they choose to make 
themselves invisible, in which case neither of you can see the other).
To change the status friends see about you in their buddy list, click the 
arrow button beneath your name in the Buddy List window to open the My 
Status menu. (Alternatively, you can choose iChat➪My Status to open the 
My Status menu.) Choose a status line, as shown in Figure 3-13, and your 
chosen status now appears in your friends’ buddy lists.
You can also choose a status that lets your buddies know you are available 
and what you are doing, such as surfing the Web or reading e-mail. If you 
choose Current iTunes Song, people can see the name of the song you’re 
listening to. If you choose Custom Available, you can type your own message 
that others will see. Choosing Custom Away lets you type your own away 
message.

The My 
Status menu 
provides a 
variety of 
statuses you 
can display.
	
Becoming invisible
Another way to avoid receiving chat invitations is to make yourself invisible 
to your buddies. Being invisible lets you see who on your buddy lists might 
be available to chat, but when other people see your name on their buddy 
lists, your name appears as though you are offline.
To make yourself invisible in iChat, click the arrow beneath your name in the 
buddy list window to open the My Status menu and then choose Invisible.
To make yourself visible again, open the My Status menu and choose a 
status that indicates you are online and available or away, such as Available 
or On the Phone.
	
If you want to leave iChat running but sign out so that you are truly offline 
and unavailable, open the My Status menu beneath your name in the buddy 
list window and choose Offline.
As an alternative to taking time to click Decline on every chat invitation you 
receive, iChat offers several ways to decline invitations automatically.
Accepting (or blocking) chat invitations 
with privacy levels
Rather than block invitations from everyone, you might want to accept chat 
invitations from some people but block them from others. For example, your 
editor might be harassing you so you want to block that person, but some­
one close to you, such as a family member or good friend, might need to 
reach you so you want that person to get through at any time.

5.	 Click the Close button to close the iChat preferences window.
Taking a Look at Other Chat Programs
Although your Mac comes with iChat, you might need to use other chat 
programs to connect with your friends, family, and coworkers. For example, 
some of your friends might use Windows PCs, and others might use a Mac 
but have a chat account that doesn’t work with iChat, such as Yahoo! or 
MSN Messenger.
Here’s a list of a few chat programs you can check out to make your Mac 
more fluent when it comes to chatting with more people and more text, 
audio, and video chat accounts and programs:
	
✦	 AOL Instant Messenger (www.aim.com): AOL’s chat program has one 
thing iChat does not: Annoying advertisements that play in a portion of 
your Buddy List window whenever you’re running AIM. Because iChat 
lets you connect to fellow AIM buddies, you don’t need to bother with 
downloading, installing, and running AIM — but you can encourage your 
friends who use Windows PCs to use it so you can connect with them 
using iChat on your Mac.
	
✦	 Microsoft Messenger (www.microsoft.com/mac): Popular on Windows 
PCs and also available for Mac, people using Microsoft Messenger’s 
chat program typically sign in with an e-mail address that ends with 
@hotmail.com, @live.com, or @msn.com, and acts as the user’s chat 
account sign-in name. You can also use any other existing e-mail address 
to create a Windows Live ID that you can then use to sign in to Microsoft 
Messenger. 
	
	 If you use Microsoft Hotmail or sign in to an Xbox LIVE account when 
you play your Xbox 360, you already have a Windows Live ID that you 
can use to sign in to Microsoft Messenger for Mac. Microsoft Messenger 
for Mac lets you connect with buddies to send and receive text mes­
sages, share files and photos, and conduct audio and video chats.

Taking a Look at Other Chat Programs
	
✦	 Yahoo! Messenger (messenger.yahoo.com): Popular on Macs and 
Windows PCs alike, Yahoo! Messenger can connect you with other bud­
dies who have a free @yahoo.com e-mail address so you can send and 
receive text messages, share files and photos, and conduct audio and 
video chats.
	
✦	 Skype (www.skype.com): Like the programs in the above list, Skype 
offers you free text and audio and video chat with friends who also have 
a Skype account. Skype can also make audio chat calls to someone’s real 
telephone number — but using that feature will cost you. Fortunately, 
Skype’s monthly rates are reasonable for unlimited calls to
 
• Landlines and cellphones in the United States and Canada for $2.95 
per month
 
• Landlines in a particular country of your choosing, such as Mexico, 
Italy, or Japan, for $5.95 per month
 
• Landlines to over 40 countries for $12.95 per month
	
✦	 Google Gmail Video (google.com/gmail): Got a free @gmail.com 
e-mail account? Bet you don’t know you can use it to conduct audio and 
video chats with other Gmail users via your Gmail Web-based Inbox 
page. To use the audio and video chat feature, sign in to your Gmail 
account, click the Settings link at the top of the Web page, click the Chat 
link on the Settings Web page, and then follow the directions to down­
load and install the voice and video chat program that enables your Mac 
to take advantage of the feature.
	
✦	 Adium (www.adiumx.com): Adium (shown in Figure 3-15) is a free chat 
program that lets you set up multiple chat accounts, some of which 
include:
 
• AIM
 
• Jabber
 
• MSN Messenger
 
• Yahoo! Messenger
 
• MobileMe
 
• Google Talk
 
• Facebook
 
• Twitter
 
• MySpace
 
• LiveJournal
 
• ICQ

	 With a huge library of user-generated add-ons that lets you change the 
way Adium looks and works, Adium is my favorite all-around, all-in-one 
chat program except for one thing: You can’t use it to conduct audio 
or video chats. Adium’s developer does state however that they under­
stand audio and video chatting are high-demand features and that a 
future release of the program might offer those features.
	
✦	 Digsby (www.digsby.com): Like Adium, Digsby can consolidate a gaggle 
of chat accounts into one nice, neat buddy list. Unlike Adium however, 
Digsby does allow you to partake in audio and video chats, sort of. 
Unlike the way iChat, MSN Messenger, Skype, Yahoo! Messenger, and 
AIM open a separate live video window or full-screen display when you 
conduct a video chat, Digsby handles video chats by launching your 
Web browser and displaying your video chat on a Web page.

Chapter 4: Protecting Your 
Mac against Threats
In This Chapter
✓	Locking your Mac
✓	Setting up user accounts
✓	Using parental controls
W
ith the worldwide connectivity of the Internet, everyone is vulner­
able to everything, including malicious software (known as malware) 
and malicious people with above average computer skills (known as hack­
ers). Although threats over the Internet attract the most attention, your Mac 
is also vulnerable from mundane threats, such as thieves who might want to 
steal your computer.
No matter how much you know about computers, you can always become 
a victim if you’re not careful. Therefore, this chapter looks at the different 
ways to protect your Mac from both physical and cyber threats.
Locking Down Your Mac
Most people lock their car and house doors when they’re away, and your 
Mac should be no exception. To protect your Mac physically, you can get 
a security cable that wraps around an immovable object (like that heavy 
rolltop desk you have in the den) and then attaches to your Mac. You can 
attach it by using glue, by threading it through a handle or hole in your 
Macintosh case, or by connecting it to a security slot built into your Mac. 
(The security slot is a tiny slot that a security cable plugs into. You might 
have to peek around the back or side of your Mac to find this security slot.) 
Some companies that sell security cables are
	
✦	 Kensington (http://us.kensington.com)
	
✦	 Targus (www.targus.com)
	
✦	 Belkin (www.belkin.com)
	
Security cables can be cut. The main purpose of a security cable is to deter 
a thief who isn’t carrying a pair of bolt cutters.

418
Locking Down Your Mac
After protecting your Mac physically, you have two other ways to lock down 
your Mac and keep other people out: by using a password, to stop intruders 
from sneaking into your computer if you step away from your desk, and by 
using a software or hardware firewall, or both, to stop intruders from sneak­
ing into your computer over the Internet.
	
Anyone with enough time, determination, and skill can defeat passwords and 
firewalls. Security can only discourage and delay an intruder, but nothing 
can ever guarantee to stop one.
Using passwords
Before you can ever use your Mac, you must configure it by creating an 
account name and password. If you’re the only person using your Mac, you’ll 
probably have just one account. If you disable automatic login, your pass­
word can keep others from using your Mac without your knowledge. 
As a rule, your password should be difficult for someone to guess but easy 
for you to remember. Unfortunately, that often means people use simple 
passwords. To make your password difficult to guess but easy to remember, 
you should create a password that uses a combination of letters and num­
bers, such as “OCHSco’10alum” (which sounds out the phrase, “Ocean City 
High School class of 2010 Alumnus”).
	
Two popular ways to create passwords include taking the first letters of 
the words in a phrase that you’ll never forget or using a name of a dearly 
departed pet (or a combination of both). By picking a memorable phrase 
or lyric, such as “I’m walkin’ on sunshine” and turning it into a nonsensical 
combination of letters, paired with the name of your long-gone pet hermit 
crab, Louise (IwosLouise), you’ll easily remember your password, but others 
won’t easily guess it. Presumably, nobody would ever know the lyrics of a 
song you like or the name of a dog, cat, goldfish, or yes, hermit crab, you had 
when you were ten years old. Pairing these two things that are unique to you 
makes for a password that’s easy for you to remember but hard for someone 
to guess.
Changing your password
For additional security, you should change your password periodically. To 
change your password, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences.
	
	 The System Preferences window appears.
	
2.	 Click the Accounts icon to open the Accounts preferences pane, as 
shown in Figure 4-1.
	
	 If the lock icon in the lower-left corner of the preferences window is locked, 
you must unlock it to make changes to your Mac’s user account details.

8.	 Enter a descriptive phrase into the Password Hint text box.
	
	 Adding a hint can help you remember your password, but it can also 
give an intruder a hint on what your password might be.
	
9.	 Click Change Password. 
	
	 The password dialog disappears.
	
10.	 Click the Close button to close the Accounts preferences window.
Applying password protection
Normally, you need your password to log in to your account, install new soft­
ware, or make certain changes to your Mac’s settings. That means anyone 
can use your Mac if you walk away and don’t log out.
If you leave your Mac without logging out, your Mac will either go to sleep or 
display a screen saver. At this time, anyone could tap the keyboard and have 
full access to your Mac. To avoid this problem, you can password-protect 
your Mac when waking up from sleep or after displaying a screen saver. 
For further protection, you can also password-protect your Mac from allow­
ing an unauthorized person to make any changes to your Mac’s various 
System Preferences. By applying password protection to different parts of 
your Mac, you can increase the chances that you’ll be the only one to con­
trol your computer.
	
If you’re the only person who has physical access to your Mac, you won’t 
have to worry about password protection, but if your Mac is in an area 
where others can access it easily, password protection can be one extra step 
in keeping your Mac private.
To password-protect different parts of your Mac, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
	
	 The System Preferences window appears.
	
2.	 Click the Security icon to open the Security preferences pane.
	
	 If the lock icon in the lower-left corner of the preferences window is 
locked, you must unlock it to make changes to your Mac’s user account 
details. Click the lock icon, type your password in the dialog that appears, 
and then press Return to unlock your Mac’s user account details.
	
3.	 Click the General tab. 
	
	 The General preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 4-3.

will encrypt the temporary data that almost every program stores on 
your hard drive while the program is running. If you don’t use secure 
virtual memory, other highly tech-savvy people might be able to read 
this temporary data that can remain on your hard drive even after 
you turn off your computer.
 
• Disable Location Services: Disabling this option prevents your Mac 
from revealing your time zone or other location-related information

control. (This option won’t appear if your Mac doesn’t have an infra­
red receiver.)
	
8.	 Click the Close button of the Security preferences window.
Using firewalls
When you connect your Mac to the Internet, you essentially open a door to 
your Mac that allows a highly technical person (such as a hacker) situated 
anywhere in the world to access your computer, copy or modify your files, 
or erase all your data. To keep out unwanted intruders, every computer 
needs a special program called a firewall.
A firewall simply blocks access to your computer while still allowing you 
access to the Internet so you can browse Web sites or send and receive 
e-mail. Every Mac comes with a software firewall that can protect you when­
ever your Mac connects to the Internet. 
	
Many people use a special device, called a router, to connect to the Internet. 
A router lets multiple computers use a single Internet connection, such as 
a high-speed broadband cable or DSL Internet connection. Routers include 
built-in hardware firewalls, and using one in combination with your Mac’s 
software firewall can provide your Mac with twice the protection of using 
only one of these types of firewall options. To learn more about how to con­
figure your own router’s firewall settings, refer to the router’s user guide or 
look for more information in the support section of the router manufactur­
er’s Web site.
Configuring a firewall
Although the default setting for your Mac’s firewall should be adequate for 
most people, you might want to configure your firewall to block additional 
Internet features for added security. For example, most people will likely 
need to access e-mail and Web pages, but if you never transfer files using 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol), you can safely block this service. 
	
Don’t configure your firewall unless you’re sure you know what you’re doing. 
Otherwise, you might weaken the firewall or lock programs from accessing 
the Internet and not know how to repair those problems.

Buying a firewall
Although the built-in Mac firewall blocks incoming connections well, it 
allows all outgoing connections. Allowing all outgoing connections means a 
malicious program you might inadvertently download could communicate 
via the Internet without your knowledge. To prevent this problem, you need 
a firewall that can block both incoming and outgoing connections.
There are two big threats that exploit personal 
computers that aren’t protected by properly 
configured firewall preferences or properly con­
figured router firewall settings. The first of these 
threats, malware, consists of programs that 
sneak on to your computer and then secretly 
connect to the Internet to do merely annoying 
(and offensive) things like retrieve pornographic 
ads that appear all over your screen, or do more 
serious things like infect your computer with a 
virus that can erase your personal data. Or, they 
can keep track of every keystroke you type on 
your computer, which in turn is transmitted to a 
snooping program on a malicious person’s com­
puter so they can find out things like your credit 
card numbers and usernames and passwords.
A second type of program that requires an out­
going Internet connection is a RAT (Remote 
Access Trojan). Malicious hackers often trick 
people into downloading and installing a RAT 
on their computer. When installed, a RAT can 
connect to the Internet and allow the malicious 
hacker to completely control the computer 
remotely over the Internet, including deleting 
or copying files, conducting attacks through 
this computer, or sending junk e-mail (spam) 
through this computer.
Although computer malware and RATs written 
and released by hackers typically target PCs 
running Windows, security experts agree it’s 
only a matter of time before the same digital 
nastiness begins infecting Macs. To guard 
against potential viruses, spyware, and RATs, 
your Mac displays a dialog that alerts you 
when you run a program for the first time. This 
feature can alert you if a virus, spyware, or a 
RAT tries to infect a Mac, but for further protec­
tion, consider purchasing a router with built-in 
firewall features, or installing an antivirus and 
antimalware program such as ClamXav (www.
clamxav.com), which is free, or buying a 
commercial protection suite such as those 
offered by Intego (www.intego.com) and 
Symantec (www.symantec.com).
Dealing with nasty malware and RATs

426
Locking Down Your Mac
	
You should use only one software firewall at a time, although it’s possible 
to use one software firewall and a hardware firewall built into your router. 
If you use two or more software firewall programs, they may interfere with 
each other and cause your Mac to stop working correctly.
If you want a more robust firewall than the one that comes with the Mac 
(and the added security of antivirus and antimalware protection), consider 
one of the following:
	
✦	 ClamXav (free; www.clamxav.com)
	
✦	 Intego NetBarrier or Internet Security Barrier ($50 - $100; www.
intego.com)
	
✦	 Norton Internet Security ($80; www.symantec.com)
One problem with a firewall is that, in the normal scheme of things, you never 
really know how well it’s working. To help you measure the effectiveness of 
your firewall, visit one of the following sites that will probe and test your com­
puter, looking for the exact same vulnerabilities that hackers will look for.
	
✦	 Audit My PC (www.auditmypc.com)
	
✦	 HackerWatch (www.hackerwatch.org/probe)
	
✦	 Shields Up! (www.grc.com)
	
✦	 Symantec Security Check (http://security.symantec.com)
Because each firewall-testing Web site might test for different features, test­
ing your Mac with two or more of these sites can help ensure that your Mac 
is as secure as possible. Figure 4-6 shows the results of a Symantec Security

Creating Multiple Accounts
Creating Multiple Accounts
Every Mac has at least one account that allows you to use your computer. 
However, if multiple people need to use your Mac, you probably don’t want 
to share the same account, which can be like trying to share the same pair 
of pants.
One problem with sharing the same account is that one person might 
change the screen saver or delete a program that someone else might want. 
To avoid people interfering with each other, you can divide your Mac into 
multiple accounts. 
Essentially, multiple accounts give your Mac a split personality. Each 
account lets each person customize the same Mac while shielding other 
users from these changes. Therefore, one account can display pink daffodils 
on the screen, and a second account can display pictures of Mt. Rushmore.
	
To access any account, you need to log in to that account. To exit an 
account, you need to log out.
Not only do separate accounts keep multiple users from accessing each oth­
er’s files, but creating multiple accounts also gives you the ability to restrict 
what other accounts can do. That means you can block Internet access from 
an account, limit Internet access to specific times, or limit Internet access to 
specific Web sites. (It’s great for parents, of course, which is why such limits 
are referred to as parental controls.)
To protect your files and settings, you should create a separate account for 
each person who uses your Mac. You can create four types of accounts:
	
✦	 Administrator: Gives the user access to create, modify, and delete 
accounts. Typically, you have only one Administrator account; however, 
another user you trust implicitly, such as your partner or spouse, might 
also have an Administrator account.
	
✦	 Standard: Gives the user access to the computer and allows them to 
install programs or change their account settings, but doesn’t let the 
user create, modify, or delete accounts or change any locked System 
Preferences settings.
	
✦	 Managed with Parental Controls: Gives the user restricted access to the 
computer based on the parental controls defined by an Administrator 
account.
	
✦	 Guest: Gives the user access, but any Web site history the user gener­
ates by visiting Web sites, or any files the user saves on the hard drive, 
are deleted when the guest account user logs off.
The only difference between the Administrator and Standard accounts is 
that the Standard account cannot create, modify, or delete other accounts 

428
Creating Multiple Accounts
or change any locked System Preferences settings. Otherwise, a Standard 
account gives users unrestricted freedom to do anything they want on 
the Mac.
The Managed with Parental Controls and Guest accounts restrict access 
to what users can do on your Mac. The main difference is any files a Guest 
user downloads to the Mac’s hard disk won’t be saved once the Guest user 
logs out.
Creating a Parental Controls user account
If you want users to be able to save files but you still want to restrict their 
access to the Internet or certain programs, you want to create a Managed 
with Parental Controls account. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
	
	 The System Preferences window appears.
	
2.	 Click the Accounts icon to open the Accounts preferences pane (refer 
to Figure 4-1).
	
	 If the lock icon in the lower-left corner of the preferences window is 
locked, you must unlock it to make changes to your Mac’s user account 
details. Click the lock icon, type your password in the dialog that appears, 
and then press Return to unlock your Mac’s user account details.
	
3.	 Click the Add (+) button in the lower-left corner (above the lock icon).
	
	 An Accounts dialog appears, as shown in Figure 4-7.
	
Figure 4-7: 
The 
Accounts 
dialog lets 
you define 
your new 
account.

429
Creating Multiple Accounts
	
4.	 Choose Managed with Parental Controls from the New Account pop-up 
menu.
	
	 Instead of choosing Managed with Parental Controls, you can choose 
Administrator or Standard to create an Administrator or Standard 
account if you want to create one of those user account types.
	
5.	 Enter the name of the person who’ll be using the account into the Full 
Name text box.
	
6.	 (Optional) Click the Account Name text box and edit the short name 
that your Mac automatically creates.
	
7.	 Enter a password for this account into the Password text box.
	
	 If you click the key to the right of the password text box, your Mac will 
generate a random password that may be more difficult to guess than 
your doggie’s name, but also harder to remember.
	
8.	 Re-enter the password you choose in Step 7 into the Verify text box.
	
9.	 (Optional) In the Password Hint text box, enter a descriptive phrase to 
help remind you of your password.
	
10.	 (Optional) Select the Turn On FileVault Protection check box to 
encrypt files the user stores in their Home folder. 
	
	 If you allow users to encrypt files, they can hide the contents of their 
files from anyone — even folks with an Administrator account. 
	
	 Keep in mind that turning on FileVault can make your Mac slower 
because it takes time to encrypt and decrypt your data.
	
	 If you turn on FileVault and the user forgets their password, they won’t 
be able to access their files, but you (or another user with Admin-level 
account access) can use the FileVault’s Master Password feature to 
retrieve the user’s files and reset their password with one they’ll hope­
fully remember next time they log in.
	
11.	 Click the Create Account button. 
	
	 The Accounts preferences pane displays the name of your new account.
	
12.	 Click the Close button of the Accounts preferences window. 
Creating a Guest account
A Guest account is handy if you want multiple users to access your Mac. 
(If you have a Mac in a public lobby for anyone to use, for example, you use 
a Guest account.) 

430
Creating Multiple Accounts
	
You can create only one Guest account because multiple users will access 
the same Guest account. To create a Guest account, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
	
	 The System Preferences window appears.
	
2.	 Click the Accounts icon to open the Accounts preferences pane (refer 
to Figure 4-1).
	
	 If the lock icon in the lower-left corner of the preferences window is 
locked, you must unlock it to make changes to your Mac’s user account 
details. Click the lock icon, type your password in the dialog that appears, 
and then press Return to unlock your Mac’s user account details.
	
3.	 Click the Guest Account icon that appears in the list box on the left, as 
shown in Figure 4-8.

4.	 (Optional) Click the Open Parental Controls button if you want to 
specify which programs guests can use (or not use) and whether they 
can access the Web.
	
	 I write about adjusting these settings in the next section, “Defining 
parental controls.”
	
5.	 Select the Allow Guests to Log In to This Computer check box, which 
allows anyone to use your Mac’s Guest account without a password.

6.	 (Optional) Select or deselect the Allow Guests to Connect to Shared 
Folders check box.
	
	 If this option is selected, a Guest account can read files created by other 
accounts and stored in a special shared folder or the other users’ Public 
folder.
	
7.	 Click the Close button of the Accounts preferences window.
Defining parental controls 
You can apply parental controls only to a Guest account or a Managed with 
Parental Controls account. After you create a Guest account or at least one 
Managed with Parental Controls account, you can apply parental controls to 
those accounts.
You can place several types of restrictions on an account:
	
✦	 System: Limits which programs the account can run.
	
✦	 Content: Limits which Web sites the account can access.
	
✦	 Mail & iChat: Limits the account to sending and receiving e-mail and 
instant messages from a fixed list of approved people.
	
✦	 Time Limits: Prevents accessing the account at certain times or on cer­
tain days.
	
✦	 Simple Finder: Creates a Finder that’s easier for novice Mac users to 
work with.
	
✦	 Administer Printers: Prevents modifications to the printers connected 
to the Macintosh.
	
✦	 Burn CDs and DVDs: Prevents saving data to a CD or DVD.
	
✦	 Password: Prevents changing the account password.
	
✦	 Dock: Prevents modifying the Dock.
To apply parental controls to an account, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences. 
	
	 The System Preferences window appears.
	
2.	 Click the Parental Controls icon to open the Parental Controls prefer­
ences pane, as shown in Figure 4-9.

4.	 Click the System tab (if it isn’t already selected).
	
	 The System preferences pane appears.
	
5.	 (Optional) Select the Use Simple Finder check box. 
	
	 This creates a Finder that’s easier for novice Mac users to work with.
	
6.	 Select the Only Allow Selected Applications check box. 
	
7.	 Click the gray triangle to the left of each application category to 
display a list of programs for the selected category and then select 
or deselect the programs you want to allow or disable the user from 
accessing.
	
	 Selecting or deselecting the check box for an entire application category, 
such as iLife, Internet, or Utilities, gives you a single-click way to allow 
user access to all or none of the programs in that selected category.

T
hink of iPhoto as a place where you can dump all your digital photo­
graphs so you can browse them again later. In iPhoto, all your pictures 
are stored in a Library. The Library provides five ways to organize your 
pictures:
	
✦	 Events typically contain pictures captured on the same day.
	
✦	 Albums typically contain pictures grouped by a common theme, such 
as pictures of your commitment ceremony or vacation.
	
✦	 Faces organizes your Library based on faces of individuals that you tag 
with a name and, over time, iPhoto tries to identify faces in new pictures 
you import and automatically tag them with the name of the person (or 
persons) in the pictures.
	
✦	 Places automatically tags and organizes your pictures based on where you 
snapped them with your GPS-capable camera or mobile phone, like the 
Nikon Coolpix 6000 camera or the iPhone 3G S smartphone, which both 
have built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. You can also tag 
pictures with location information on an individual or group basis.
	
✦	 Folders hold and organize multiple albums. You can create a folder 
called Animals, for instance, and then store albums, such as Goats, 
Monkeys, Terriers, and Hermit Crabs, inside your Animals folder.

Importing Pictures
442
After importing your pictures, iPhoto lets you edit your pictures to modify 
colors, fix photos containing people afflicted by that vexing “red-eye” condi­
tion, or clip out unwanted portions. When your pictures look perfect, you 
can print them on your printer or through a printing service (which can 
actually cost less money than what you might spend on ink cartridges and 
glossy photo paper!). You can also share pictures in your iPhoto Library 
with others via e-mail, or by posting them to Web sites, such as MobileMe, 
Facebook, or Flickr. From start to finish, iPhoto can take care of organizing 
your pictures so you can focus on taking even more pictures.
Importing Pictures
Before you can organize your pictures, you need to import them into iPhoto. 
The import process saves photos in series of folders based on certain crite­
ria that makes it possible for iPhoto to keep track of everything. If you have 
pictures stored in other folders on your hard drive, on other storage devices 
(such as CDs or DVDs), or trapped inside a digital camera, the first step is to 
copy those pictures into iPhoto.
To copy pictures into iPhoto — or, to use the accepted lingo, to import 
pictures into iPhoto — follow these steps:
	
1.	 Insert or connect the storage device — thumb drive, digital camera, 
CD, whatever — that contains the pictures you want to import into 
iPhoto. 
	
	 If your pictures are already stored in a folder on your hard drive, skip 
this step.
	
2.	 Click the iPhoto icon in the Dock (or double-click the iPhoto icon in 
the Applications folder) to open iPhoto.
	
3.	 (Optional) If you’re running iPhoto for the first time, two dialogs will 
appear, as shown in Figures 1-1 and 1-2, asking:
 
• Do you want to use iPhoto when you connect your digital camera?: 
Click Yes if you want iPhoto to automatically open whenever you 
plug in your digital camera or camera-enabled smartphone. Click No 
if you don’t want iPhoto to automatically open or click Decide Later 
if you’d rather make this momentous decision another time.
 
• Look up Photo Locations: Click Yes if you want iPhoto to automati­
cally tag location information when it imports photos you snap with 
your GPS-capable camera or smartphone.
	
4.	 Choose File➪Import to Library. 
	
	 An Import Photos dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-3.

Proceed to Step 7.
 
• To import individual files from a drive or folder: Click the picture file 
in the middle column that you want to import, or click a folder in the 
middle column that contains the pictures you want to import and then 
click the picture file that you want to import in the right column.
	
	 To select multiple pictures, hold down the Ô key and click each pic­
ture you want to import. To select a range of pictures, click the first 
picture you want to import, hold down the Shift key, and then click 
the last picture to highlight all the pictures in between.
	
7.	 Click Import.
	
	 iPhoto imports your pictures and organizes them into an Event, or sev­
eral Events if the picture files you import are tagged with information 
about them, and/or if you import the contents of two or more separate 
folders.
	
A fast way to import pictures into iPhoto is to drag and drop those pictures 
to the iPhoto icon in the Dock, or to the Photos category under Library in 
the iPhoto sidebar.
Organizing Events in the Library
The iPhoto Library can store literally thousands of pictures, which can soon 
become as disorganized as dumping a decade’s worth of photographs in a 
box and then wondering why you can never find a specific picture easily. 
Just as most people organize pictures in albums, boxes, or bags, iPhoto can 
organize groups of pictures in one place. In iPhoto, a group of related pic­
tures is an Event.
	
Two other ways you can organize and view pictures is by using the Faces 
feature, which sorts pictures by the faces of people in your pictures, and 
the Places feature, which sorts pictures based on the location where you 
capture them. Both of these other ways of organizing and viewing pictures in 
your iPhoto Library are covered in later sections of this chapter.
The main purpose of Events is to group related pictures together. One Event 
might contain pictures you capture during your stay on a UFO, and a second 
Event might hold pictures of your new puppy’s first visit to the beach. After 
you group related pictures in an Event, you quickly can find pictures you 
want to look at again or share with others.

Organizing Events in the Library
445
Creating an Event
When you import pictures, iPhoto automatically organizes them as Events, 
based on the day the picture was captured. Organizing Events by day can 
automatically sort pictures into one Event (the first day of your vacation 
when you visited London) and a second Event (the second day of your vaca­
tion when you visited Paris, and so on).
You can also create an Event manually by choosing Events➪Create Events.
Browsing through an Event
An Event can represent a single picture you capture on a particular day, 
but more likely, an Event represents several pictures. To view thumbnail 
previews of all the pictures stored in an Event, hover the pointer over the 
Event icon, and then slowly move the pointer left or right (or press the left 
and right arrow keys) to step through a thumbnail preview of each picture 
contained in the Event.
	
When you position the pointer over an Event, iPhoto displays the date of the 
event and the number of pictures it contains, as shown in Figure 1-4.
	
Figure 1-4: 
Hovering 
the pointer 
on an Event 
reveals its 
date and 
number of 
pictures.
	
If you’d rather see individual thumbnails of all the pictures stored in a single 
Event, double-click the Event to display them, as shown in Figure 1-5.
	
Click the All Events button or press the Escape key to return to the iPhoto 
window.
Naming an Event
To make finding pictures easier, you can give each Event a descriptive name 
so you have a rough idea what type of pictures are stored in that Event with­
out having to browse through them. To give your Event a descriptive name, 
follow these steps:

Sorting Events
The more Events you create to store your pictures, the harder it to find what 
you need. To help keep you organized, iPhoto lets you sort your Events by 
different criteria:
	
✦	 Date: Lets you sort Events by time.
	
✦	 Title: Lets you sort Events by title.
	
✦	 Manually: Lets you sort Events by clicking and dragging them.
	
You can also sort pictures by rating and keywords, but you must first give a 
picture a rating or keyword, which you find out about later in this chapter.
Sorting by date or title
Sorting by date makes it easy to find pictures based on the time you remem­
ber capturing those pictures. Sorting by title is helpful after you give all 
Events a descriptive title and want to find a picture stored under a specific 
Event title.
To sort Events by date or title within the iPhoto window, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 Click the Events category under Library in the iPhoto sidebar. 
	
	 iPhoto displays all your Events in the right pane.
	
2.	 Choose View➪Sort Events.
	
	 A submenu appears with a check mark next to the way you have your 
Events sorted, as shown in Figure 1-9.
	
3.	 Choose By Date, By Title, Manually, and Ascending or Descending.
	
	 Your Events sort by the criteria you choose.
	
Figure 1-9: 
The Sort 
Events 
submenu 
lists the 
different 
ways to sort 
Events.
	

Book V

If you choose Ascending or Descending, iPhoto sorts your Events based on the 
sorting method that appears with a check mark in the Sort Events submenu.
Sorting manually
Another way to sort Events is by clicking and dragging them within the 
iPhoto window. This gives you the freedom to arrange pictures in Events 
based on your preferences, regardless of date or titles. For example, you 
might put all your family Events near the top of the iPhoto window, which 
makes it easy to find pictures of different family members if you’re putting 
together a newsletter for a family reunion.
To sort Events manually within the iPhoto window, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 Click the Events category under Library in the iPhoto sidebar. 
	
	 iPhoto displays all your Events in the right pane.
	
2.	 Click and drag an Event you want to move to its new location.
	
	 When you move an Event between two other Events, the other Events 
slide out of the way to make room.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new position of 
the Event.
Organizing Pictures
After you store pictures in separate Events, you might want to view and 
organize individual pictures stored in an Event.
Viewing pictures stored in a single Event
If you want to view pictures in only one Event, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Events category under Library in the iPhoto sidebar. 
	
	 iPhoto displays all your Events in the right pane.
	
2.	 Double-click an Event. 
	
	 All your pictures in that Event appear in the iPhoto window, as shown in 
Figure 1-10.
	
3.	 Click the All Events button in the upper-left corner of the iPhoto 
window (or press Escape) to view all your Events again.

Viewing pictures stored in all Events
Rather than view pictures stored in a single Event, you might want to view 
all your pictures in separate Events at the same time. To view pictures in all 
Events, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Photos category under Library in the iPhoto sidebar. 
	
	 iPhoto displays all your pictures. If you’ve hidden any photos from 
view (by choosing Photos➪Hide Photos), you can view those hidden 
photos by choosing View➪Hidden Photos and making sure a check mark 
appears to the left of Hidden Photos.
	
2.	 Choose View➪Event Titles so a check mark appears to the left of Event 
Titles.
	
	 Note: If a check mark already appears to the left of Event Titles, skip this 
step.
	
	 Displaying Event Titles lets you see how your pictures are organized 
into different Events, as shown in Figure 1-11. 
	
3.	 Click the triangle to the left of the Event title to display or hide pic­
tures in an Event.
	
	 This step works only if a check mark appears to the left of Event Titles 
on the View menu.

Naming pictures
Every digital camera stores pictures with generic filenames, such as 
DSC_846. Fortunately, you can replace these generic titles with more 
descriptive names.
	
In iPhoto, you can give descriptive names to your Events and descriptive 
names to individual pictures as well. So an Event might be named “Spring 
Break,” and pictures stored in that Event might be named “Day 1: Arrival,” 
“Day 2: Imbibing,” and “Day 3: Recovering.”
To name individual pictures stored in an Event, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose one of the methods mentioned earlier (in the section “Viewing 
pictures in a single Event” or “Viewing pictures stored in all Events”) 
to view your pictures.

Rating pictures
Some pictures are better than others, so another way to sort and organize 
pictures is by rating them from zero to five stars. To rate pictures, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Choose one of the methods mentioned earlier (in the section “Viewing 
pictures in a single Event” or “Viewing pictures stored in all Events”) 
to view your pictures.
	
2.	 Choose View➪Rating.
	
	 Note: If a check mark already appears to the left of Rating, skip this step.
	
	 Titles appear underneath every picture.
	
3.	 Click to select the picture you want to rate.
	
	 A row of five dots appears beneath your selected picture.
	
4.	 Click the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth dot to mark the picture 
with that number of stars, as shown in Figure 1-14.
	
Figure 1-14: 
You can rate 
each picture 
with zero to

You have other ways to rate pictures:
	
✦	 Choose Photos➪My Rating and then choose the number of stars you 
want to rate the picture with from the submenu.
	
✦	 Control-click a picture and choose the My Rating submenu to pick a star 
rating.
	
✦	 Click a picture and press Ô+0 through Ô+5 to rate a picture from zero to 
five stars.
	
After you rate some or all of your pictures in an Event, you can sort them 
by choosing View➪Sort Photos➪By Rating. To change whether to sort by 
ascending or descending rating, choose View➪Sort Photos➪Ascending (or 
Descending).
Adding keywords to a picture
A keyword helps you organize pictures based on categories, such as 
Cityscapes, Nature, or All in the Family. By placing keywords on pictures, 
you can quickly find all your favorite outdoor photos or family pictures.
To add a keyword to a picture, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose one of the methods mentioned earlier (in the section “Viewing 
pictures in a single Event” or “Viewing pictures stored in all Events”) 
to view your pictures.
	
2.	 Click a picture that you want to label with a keyword.
	
	 If you hold down the Ô key, you can click two or more pictures to assign 
the same keyword to all of them.
	
3.	 Choose Window➪Show Keywords.
	
	 A Keywords window appears, which displays several common keywords 
that iPhoto provides for you, as shown in Figure 1-15.
	
Figure 1-15:

window 
displays 
a list of

	 To add your own keywords to the Keywords window, click the Edit 
Keywords button. When the Edit Keywords dialog appears, click the 
plus sign button to type your own keywords into the Keywords window. 
(You can also click a keyword and then click the minus sign button to 
remove a keyword from the Keyword window.)
	
	 If you click the Shortcut button, you can assign a key to represent a key­
word. That way you can choose View➪Keywords to display a keywords 
text box underneath each picture, click that text box, and then press 
your shortcut key to add a keyword to that picture quickly.
	
4.	 Click a keyword.
	
	 Your chosen keyword appears underneath the picture you select.
	
	 If you click the same keyword in the keyword window, iPhoto removes 
the keyword from your chosen picture.
	
After you add keywords to pictures in an Event, you can sort them by choosing 
View➪Sort Photos➪By Keyword. Then you can sort alphabetically by 
keyword by choosing View➪Sort Photos➪Ascending (or Descending).
Storing pictures in albums and folders
Sorting and organizing pictures into Events can be cumbersome. For exam­
ple, you might have dozens of birthday pictures stored in separate Events. 
Although you can store all these birthday pictures in the same Event, you 
might also want to keep them grouped with other pictures in separate 
Events that represent different years.
To keep pictures stored in separate Events while grouping them at the same 
time, you can create an album. An album groups related pictures without 
removing them from the Events they’re stored in.
Creating albums and organizing pictures manually
To create an album and store pictures in it, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪New Album.
	
	 A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-16.
	
	 For another way to create an album, click the plus sign button in the 
bottom-left corner of the iPhoto window. When a dialog appears, click 
the Album button, type a name for your album, and then click Create.

Organizing Pictures
458
	
Figure 1-16: 
A dialog 
appears so 
that you can 
name your 
album.
	
	
2.	 Type a descriptive name for your album and then click Create.
	
	 Your album name appears under the Albums category in the iPhoto 
sidebar.
	
3.	 Choose one of the methods mentioned earlier (in the section “Viewing 
pictures in a single Event” or “Viewing pictures stored in all Events”) 
to view your pictures.
	
4.	 Click and drag a picture you want to add to your album to the album 
folder in the iPhoto sidebar.
	
	 You can select multiple pictures by holding down the Ô key and clicking 
each picture you want to add to an album.
	
5.	 Release the mouse button to copy your picture to the album. 
	
6.	 Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for each additional picture you want to copy to 
the album.
	
	 Now, if you click the album name in the iPhoto sidebar, you can see all 
the pictures in that album.
	
Any changes you make to a picture stored in an album automatically appear 
in the same picture stored in an Event (and vice versa).
The preceding steps create an empty album, which you can then fill up with 
pictures. If you want to select pictures to store in an album first, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Select one or more pictures that you want to store in an album. 
	
2.	 Choose File➪New Album from Selection.
	
	 A dialog appears, asking for a name for your album.
	
3.	 Type a descriptive name for your album and then click Create. 
Creating albums and organizing pictures automatically
If manually dragging pictures in and out of albums is too tedious, you can set 
up a Smart Album from within iPhoto that will store pictures automatically.

Book V

To create a Smart Album that can store pictures automatically, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪New Smart Album (or press Option and click the Plus “+” 
icon in the lower left corner of the iPhoto window). 
	
	 A dialog appears, asking for a name for your Smart Album.
	
2.	 Type a descriptive name for your album in the Smart Album Name 
text box.
	
3.	 Click the first pop-up menu and then choose a criterion, such as 
Keyword or Rating, as shown in Figure 1-17.
	
4.	 Click the second and third pop-up menus to refine the criterion you 
choose in Step 3, such as choosing only pictures with a rating of four 
stars or with the Birthday keyword.
	
5.	 (Optional) Click the plus sign button to define another criterion and 
repeat Steps 3 and 4.
	
6.	 Click OK.
	
	 Your Smart Album now stores pictures based on your chosen criteria.
	
If you create too many albums, you can organize them into folders by choosing 
File➪New Folder and dragging each album into that folder.

Deleting pictures, albums, and folders
Many times, you’ll import pictures into iPhoto and decide that the picture 
isn’t worth saving after all. To keep your iPhoto Library from becoming too 
cluttered, you can delete the pictures you don’t need.
Besides deleting individual pictures, you can also delete albums and folders 
that contain pictures you don’t want. When you delete an album or folder 
(which contains albums), you don’t physically delete the pictures; you just 
delete the folder or album that contains the pictures. The original pictures 
are still stored in the iPhoto Library.
To delete a picture, album, or folder, click the picture, album, or folder you 
want to delete and then press the Delete key (or drag it to the Trash icon in 
the iPhoto sidebar). 
	
Press Ô+Z or choose Edit➪Undo Delete if you want to recover your deleted 
items right away.
Choosing and Organizing Pictures 
with Faces and Places
Two more ways to organize and view pictures in your iPhoto Library are to 
use the Faces and Places features.
The Faces feature lets you add names to the faces of people in your pictures 
and, over time, iPhoto automatically recognizes and labels the faces of 
people in new pictures you import into your iPhoto Library.
The Places feature automatically tags and sorts pictures you import that 
contain GPS information that your GPS-capable smartphone or camera 
adds to pictures when you snap the pictures with the GPS-tagging feature 
(referred to as geotagging) turned on.
You can use the Places feature even if you don’t have a GPS-capable smart­
phone or camera by selecting and then tagging individual pictures, or a 
group of pictures, with information that you type about the location where 
you captured the pictures.
Using Faces to organize pictures
You can organize pictures in your iPhoto Library based on the faces of 
people in the pictures.

people iPhoto has organized by face, as shown in Figure 1-19. Double-click the 
person’s group of pictures to see all your pictures of that person. Click the All 
Faces button in the upper-left corner to return to the Faces view.
Assigning and correcting faces in pictures
After you identify some pictures by using the Faces feature, iPhoto automati­
cally detects and recognizes faces in other photos in your iPhoto Library 
and in new photos that you import. iPhoto uses face detection to attempt to 
match faces that look like the same person from picture to picture. iPhoto 
also suggests possible matches of people it attempts to recognize that you 
can confirm with a few clicks of your mouse.

	 Confirm: Click the Confirm button beneath each thumbnail to confirm 
the person is whom iPhoto suggests and to add the person’s name to 
the picture. The person’s name is highlighted in green beneath the 
thumbnail.
	
	 Reject: Click the Confirm button beneath each thumbnail that doesn’t 
contain the person who iPhoto suggests and then click it a second 
time. Not followed by the person’s name is highlighted in red beneath 
the thumbnail, as shown in Figure 1-20.

Organizing pictures with Places
You can view pictures in your iPhoto Library based on the locations where 
you snapped the pictures.
	
If your camera or smartphone has a GPS feature you’ve turned on, pictures 
you import into your iPhoto Library will automatically contain information 
about the location where you captured the pictures.
Viewing pictures organized by places
You can view pictures organized by the places where the pictures were 
captured by clicking pushpins on a map of the world, or by clicking a 
display listing pictures by country, region, state, and city.
To view pictures organized by the Places feature in your iPhoto Library, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Places category under Library in the iPhoto sidebar.
	
	 iPhoto displays a map of the world with red pushpins that indicate 
locations where your pictures were captured. Moving the mouse 
pointer to a pushpin displays the name of the location where you 
captured the pictures, as shown in Figure 1-21.

Editing Pictures
Besides organizing your pictures, iPhoto lets you edit them. Such editing 
can be as simple as rotating or cropping a picture, or it can be as intricate as 
removing red-eye from a photograph or modifying colors.
	
If you need more detailed or sophisticated editing, consider buying an 
image-managing program, such as Adobe Photoshop Elements (www.adobe.
com) or GraphicConverter (www.lemkesoft.com).

✓	Adding titles, transitions, and sound
✓	Saving videos
I
f you have a digital video camcorder, a digital camera, or smartphone 
that captures video, you can create home movies. To make your home 
movies fancier and — almost — professional, settle into your Director’s 
chair and get rolling with iMovie. With iMovie, you can turn your home 
movies into a polished product that you can upload to video-sharing sites 
(such as YouTube), play on video iPods, or just view on your Mac. You can 
also transfer them to a DVD to give to your great-aunt Helen who doesn’t 
have a computer but does have a DVD player hooked up to her television. 
Any digital home movie you might have, iMovie can improve with the help 
of your skill and creativity.
How iMovie Works
The iMovie program consists of an Event Library and a Project Library. The 
Event Library appears in the bottom-left corner of the iMovie window and 
is where you store videos. When you want to work your magic and come 
up with a film project, you choose parts of any video you have stored in the 
Event Library and copy these parts (known as clips) into the Project Library, 
which appears in the upper-left corner of the iMovie window.
The basic steps for using iMovie are
	
1.	 Import, store, and organize video in the Event Library. 
	
2.	 Copy video footage from the Event Library to a project in the Project 
Library.

482
Importing a Video into the Event Library
	
3.	 Edit your video clips in the Project pane.
	
4.	 Save your video as a digital video file for viewing on other computers, on 
DVD, or over the Internet.
For the ultimate guide to making movies and burning them to DVDs, check 
out fellow For Dummies authors Dennis R. Cohen and Michael E. Cohen’s 
iMovie ‘09 & iDVD ‘09 For Dummies (Wiley).
Importing a Video into the Event Library
The Event Library holds all your videos, acting as your personal film vault. 
By storing videos in the Event Library, you can selectively choose footage 
from old videos to use in any new projects. 
To store video in the Event Library, you must import a video from one of 
three sources:
	
✦	 A digital video source, for example a digital video camera or smartphone 
capable of capturing video
	
✦	 A project created and saved using an earlier version of iMovie
	
✦	 A digital video file stored on your hard drive
Importing from a digital video camera
To import (that is, to copy) a movie to your hard drive that you’ve captured 
with a digital video camera, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Connect your digital video camera to your Mac with a USB cable. 
	
	 The appropriate cable usually comes with the camera.
	
2.	 Double-click the iMovie icon inside the Applications folder or click 
the iMovie icon in the Dock to load iMovie. 
	
	 The Import dialog appears, displaying all the clips recorded on your 
device. 
	
3.	 Choose File➪Import from Camera if the Import dialog doesn’t open 
and then choose the device you want from the Camera pop-up menu 
at the bottom.
	
4.	 Select the clips you want to import.
 
• Set the Automatic/Manual switch to Automatic to import all the clips 
and then click the Import All button.
 
• Set the Automatic/Manual switch to Manual to import some of the 
clips. Deselect the clips you don’t want to import and then click the 
Import Checked button.

Importing a Video into the Event Library
	
	 The Import dialog shown in Figure 2-1 appears, giving you a choice of 
disks where you can save your video.
	
5.	 From the Save To pop-up menu, choose where to store your video.
	
	 Video files can be large so you may want to store them on an external 
hard drive.
	
Figure 2-1: 
The Import 
dialog lets 
you choose 
where you 
want to 
save your 
video file.
	
	
6.	 Choose how to organize your video by selecting one of the following:
 
• Add to Existing Event: Stores the video as part of an existing event in 
the Event library.
 
• Create New Event: Stores the video as a new event in the Event 
library. The default name for the Event will be the date, but you can 
always type a more descriptive name.
	
7.	 Select or deselect the Split Days into New Events check box.
	
	 Many video camcorders time-stamp any video footage you capture, so 
this option divides a video into parts where each part represents all 
video footage shot on the same day.
	
8.	 Select Analyze for Stabilization after Import if you want iMovie to 
attempt to detect and smooth any shaky parts. 
	
	 You analyze only one time but analyzing is time consuming so you might 
want to do this when you’re going to be away from your computer or 
overnight. You can also analyze your video later.
	
9.	 Click the Capture button.
	
	 When iMovie is finished importing your file, the Import window appears.
	
10.	 Click Done.
	
	 Your imported video appears as thumbnail images in the lower pane 
(the Event pane) of the iMovie window, as shown in Figure 2-2. After you 
import a video, your original video footage remains on your video cam­
corder, so you might want to go back and erase it.

484
Importing a Video into the Event Library
	
Figure 2-2: 
iMovie auto-
matically 
separates 
a video into 
scenes.
	
	
If you have a digital video camera that records to DV or HDV tape, and 
which has a FireWire port, you can connect it to your Mac using your Mac’s 
FireWire port (if your Mac has one; most Mac’s do!). Follow the preceding 
steps. The only difference is when you set the Automatic/Manual switch. 
Automatic rewinds the whole tape and imports the entire video; Manual 
lets you rewind, fast-forward, and import the parts you want. Either way, 
the video plays while it’s importing so the import takes as long as the video 
takes to watch.
	
iMovie divides a video into separate scenes where each scene displays the 
first frame of a video clip. By browsing through these thumbnail images of 
scenes, you can see which scene is likely to contain the video footage you 
want to use. 
Importing a digital video file
If you have digital video files stored in QuickTime, MPEG-4, or digital video 
(DV) lying around on your hard drive, you can import them into iMovie. To 
import a digital video file, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪Import Movies. 
	
	 An Open dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-3. You might need to navi­
gate through drives and folders to find the file you want to import.

4.	 Select one of the following radio buttons:
 
• Add to Existing Event: Stores the video as part of an existing event in 
the Event Library.
 
• Create New Event: Stores the video as a new event in the iMovie 
Event Library.
	
5.	 Choose how you want to optimize high definition video in the 
Optimize Video pop-up menu.
	
	 The Large option reduces the frame size of the HD video to 960 x 540 
pixels, whereas the Full option displays the frame size at the complete 
1,920 x 1,080 pixels.
	
6.	 Select the Copy Files or Move Files radio button.
	
	 The Copy Files option leaves your original file and creates a duplicate 
file to store in iMovie. The Move Files option physically transfers your 
chosen video file and moves it into iMovie. 
	
7.	 Click Import.
	
	 Your imported movie appears as thumbnail images in the iMovie 
window.

Working with Projects
Organizing the Event Library
The more videos you store, the more crowded the Event Library becomes, 
and the harder it is to find what you want. When you store a new video in 
the Event Library, iMovie gives you the option of creating an event folder, 
which identifies the date you imported the video file into iMovie.
Organizing videos in the Event Library by date can be helpful, but you might 
prefer identifying Events by descriptive name. To rename an Event, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click an Event in the Event Library pane in the bottom-left 
corner of the iMovie window. (Choose Window➪Show Event Library if 
the Event Library is not visible.)
	
	 Your chosen Event name appears highlighted.
	
2.	 Type a descriptive name for your Event.
Storing video in different Event folders can help you find the video you want. 
If you want to edit video of your family vacation, just click the Event folder 
for that day or span of days to display your video.
The Event Library displays each video file as a series of thumbnail images. 
To define how to divide a video into multiple thumbnail images, drag the 
slider in the bottom-right corner of the iMovie window. Dragging this slider 
to the left divides your video into more thumbnail images, whereas dragging 
this slider to the right divides your video into fewer thumbnail images. The 
number on the right of the slider indicates the duration of the clip from a 
half a second up to 30 seconds or All, which means no divisions.
Instead of forcing you to browse through your entire video to find the one part 
you need, iMovie lets you jump straight to a scene that contains the footage 
you want to use. You do this by dragging the mouse pointer over the thumb­
nail images of the clips. After you find the video footage to edit, copy that 
video footage into your project by clicking and dragging it with the mouse.
Working with Projects
The Event Library contains your raw, unedited video, and the Project 
Library contains the copies of your video that you can modify. The 
Project Library appears in the upper-left corner of the iMovie window, by

Working with Projects
Projects contain one or more video clips from movies stored in the Event 
Library. In the Project Library, you can rearrange, trim, and delete video 
clips to create your movie. This is where you can also add titles or sound 
effects to your edited video. If you accidentally erase or mess up a video in 
the Project Library, just retrieve the original footage from the Event Library 
and start over. You can copy and store the same video footage in two or 
more projects. 
Creating an iMovie project
To create a project, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪New Project. 
	
	 The New Project dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-4.
	
2.	 Enter a descriptive name for your project in the Project Name text box.
	
3.	 Choose Standard, iPhone, or Widescreen from the Aspect Ratio 
pop-up menu.
	
	 The aspect ratio optimizes your video project for displaying on different 
devices. If you want to view your video on a TV set, choose Standard or 
Widescreen. If you want to view your video on a mobile phone, choose 
the smaller iPhone aspect ratio. 
	
4.	 Choose a theme if you want iMovie to apply transitions and titles to 
your project; choose None if you want to do the work yourself.

5.	 (Optional) To automatically add a particular transition effect to your 
movie, click the Automatically Add check box, then click the pop-up 
menu and choose the transition effect you want.
	
6.	 Click the Create button.
	
	 A Drag Media Here to Create a New Project pane appears in the Project 
section of the iMovie window, as shown in Figure 2-5.
	
	 The stage is set for your cinematic masterpiece.
Selecting video clips
Whether you want to create a new project or edit an existing one, you need 
to add video clips from the Event Library and place them in a project stored 
in the Project Library.
Before you can select a video clip to store in a project, you need to see 
exactly what part of a video to clip. To help you find any part of a video, 
iMovie displays an entire video as a series of images that appear like indi­
vidual frames of a filmstrip. To find a specific part of a video, you can skim 
through a video. When you find the part of a video to use, just click and drag 
it into a project.

Adding transitions
Normally, when you place video clips in a project, those video clips play one 
after another. Rather than abruptly cutting from one video clip to another, 
you can add transitions that appear in between video clips. To add a transi­
tion, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click a project in the Project Library list and then click the Edit 
Project button.

Saving a Video
The point of organizing video clips in a project is to create a polished video. 
With iMovie, you can save your project to view on a computer, in iTunes, on 
an iPod or iPhone, or even on YouTube. You can save the same video proj­
ect to different formats in case you need to view your video on your Mac but 
also want to post a copy on YouTube for other people to enjoy.
If you create an interesting video that you might want to add to other pro­
grams, such as a presentation program, you can save a video in the Media 
Browser to use in other programs.
Saving a project as a digital video file
You might want to save your iMovie project as a digital video file so you can 
burn it to DVD later (using iDVD) or give a copy to someone who wants to 
view it on their computer. When you save a project as a digital video file, 
you can save it as an MPEG-4 or a QuickTime file.

Book V 
Chapter 2
Making Movies 
with iMovie
501
Saving a Video
To save a project as an MPEG-4 digital video file, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click a project in the Project Library list. 
	
2.	 Choose Share➪Export Movie. 
	
	 The Export Movie dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-15.
	
Figure 2-15: 
The Export 
Movie 
dialog 
lets you 
choose the 
resolution 
for playing 
on different 
devices.
	
	
3.	 Choose the location to save your project from the Where pop-up 
menu.
	
	 You can expand the menu by clicking the disclosure triangle to the right 
of the Export As field.
	
4.	 Select a Size to Export radio button (such as Medium or Tiny) and then 
click Export.
	
	 The sizes define the frame size. Smaller frame sizes are designed for 
viewing on smaller screens, such as an iPhone screen, whereas larger 
frame sizes are designed for viewing on bigger screens, such as a com­
puter or TV.
	
For those of you who are interested in the technical details about what’s 
going on behind the scenes when you export a video, here’s the skinny: 
iMovie saves as MPEG-4 by default (using the H.264 codec for a type 10 
encoding). According to Dennis R. Cohen, this book’s illustrious (and indus­
trious) technical editor (and fellow Dummies author), the way iMovie saves 
a video file you export is “a tactical tradeoff Apple makes to conserve space 
while forsaking as little video/audio quality as possible in the process” (a bit 
of behind-the-scenes information). Additionally, the way iMovie saves a file 
you export results in “an extra lossy compression any time another format is 
desired.” Dennis’s advice: “Going to iDVD gets best quality results when the 
DV Stream codec is employed.”

Saving (and removing) a video for iTunes
If you create a particularly interesting video and store it on your hard drive, 
you might later have trouble finding it. To fix this problem, save your videos 
in your iTunes library. This way you can quickly find and play videos later. 
To save a project that you can play in iTunes, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click a project in the Project Library list.
	
2.	 Choose Share➪iTunes.
	
	 The Publish to iTunes dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-16.

3.	 Select or deselect one or more check boxes (such as Medium or Tiny) 
and then click Publish.
	
	 The sizes define the frame size of your video. Smaller sizes make your 
video look best on small screens, such as on mobile phones. Larger 
sizes make your video look best on larger screens, such as on a TV set. 
Your movie now appears in your iTunes library on your hard drive.
	
After you save a movie to iTunes, you can remove it by choosing Share➪
Remove from iTunes.
Saving (and removing) a project for YouTube
One way to show off your movie is by uploading it to the Web so others can 
watch it online or download it and watch it whenever they want. The most 
well-know (and well-trafficked!) video-sharing site is YouTube.
	
YouTube limits video files you upload to a maximum file size of 100MB and a 
maximum time length of 10 minutes, whichever comes first.
When you capture an interesting video, you can save your project to 
YouTube. After setting up a YouTube account (www.youtube.com), you can 
upload a video from iMovie to YouTube by following these steps:

✓	Working with iDVD projects
I
f you simply want to share digital photographs and movies with others, 
you could burn your pictures and movies as separate files onto a DVD. 
Friends and family could see your pictures or movies, but they’d have to 
search through the DVD’s folders to find each individual file. Although this 
method works, it makes looking at pictures and movies about as tedious as 
browsing a hard drive to find word processor or spreadsheet documents. 
To make DVDs useful for both storing and presenting digital pictures and 
movies, use the iDVD program. iDVD lets you create photo slideshows 
or movies complete with menus and graphics that can play on almost 
any recent or new DVD player. If you ever dreamed of creating your own 
Hollywood-style DVDs to present your home movies or digital photographs, 
iDVD can help you achieve your dreams.
To create a DVD, iDVD gives you three choices:
	
✦	 OneStep DVD: Transfers a video directly from a digital video camcorder 
or movie file to a DVD. 
	
✦	 Magic iDVD: Provides a variety of DVD templates that you can modify 
for creating menus to organize the content of digital photographs and 
movies stored on the DVD.
	
✦	 A DVD project: Lets you create custom DVD menus and graphics for 
storing and presenting digital photographs and movies. 
	
To burn DVDs using iDVD, you need a Mac with a DVD drive that can write 
to DVD discs. If your Mac’s DVD drive can’t write to DVDs, you can purchase 
an external DVD drive that’s capable of burning DVD discs, or you can trans­
fer your iDVD project to another Mac to create your DVD.

Burning a Video Straight to DVD
	
For the ultimate guide to making movies and burning them to DVDs, check 
out fellow For Dummies authors Dennis R. Cohen and Michael E. Cohen’s 
iMovie ’09 & iDVD ’09 For Dummies (Wiley).
Burning a Video Straight to DVD
The OneStep DVD option lets you burn a video from your FireWire-enabled 
video camcorder, or from a movie file on your hard drive, to a recordable 
DVD in your Mac. When you insert your finished DVD into a DVD player, 
your video starts playing immediately, with no DVD menus.
	
Although USB-enabled camcorders, digital cameras, and smartphones 
don’t work directly with OneStep DVD, you can still use video captured 
from those devices by copying the captured video files to iPhoto, and then 
choosing those files when you select the files you want to use to create 
your OneStep DVD.
To burn a video from your video-capturing device to a DVD with the OneStep 
DVD option, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the iDVD icon in the Dock (or double-click the iDVD icon in the 
Applications folder).
	
	 The iDVD opening window appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.

	 Keep in mind that if you add a 3-minute audio file over a slideshow (drop 
well) that contains three slides, each slide will appear for 1 minute until 
the entire audio file finishes playing. If you add a 3-minute audio file to 
a slideshow of 30 slides, each slide will appear for 0.1 minutes. So the 
more slides (pictures) you add, the faster the images pop up and disap­
pear while the audio file plays.

Working with iDVD Projects
For maximum flexibility, you can design your own DVD menus and add 
graphics to give your DVD a polished, professional look. When you create 
your own DVD project, you can save it and edit it later. 
The following list explains the different parts of an iDVD project:
	
✦	 Title menu: Displays a list of the DVD contents, such as movies or 
slideshows.
	
✦	 Slideshows: Displays a slideshow of digital photographs.
	
✦	 Movies: Displays a movie.

Book V 
Chapter 3

✦	 Text: Displays text — useful for providing instructions or descriptions 
about the DVD.
	
✦	 Submenus: Displays another menu where you can offer additional 
slideshows or movies.
	
✦	 Opening content: Displays a photo or movie that appears as soon as 
someone inserts the DVD into a DVD player. In many commercial DVDs, the 
opening content is usually an FBI warning about copyright infringement.
	
Not every iDVD project uses all the preceding parts. At the very least, an 
iDVD project needs a title menu and one slideshow or movie.
To create a DVD project, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the iDVD icon in the Dock (or double-click the iDVD icon in the 
Applications folder).
	
2.	 Click Create a New Project.
	
	 A Create Project dialog appears, as shown in Figure 3-5. 
	
	 If you already created a project and want to edit it, all you need to do is 
click Open an Existing Project (not shown in the figure).
	
Figure 3-5: 
The Create 
Project 
dialog lets 
you define 
a name and 
aspect ratio 
for your 
DVD.
	
	
3.	 Enter a descriptive name for your project into the Save As text box 
and then choose where you want to save your project from the Where 
pop-up menu.
	
4.	 Next to Aspect Ratio, click the Standard (for ordinary TV screens) or 
Widescreen (for widescreen TVs) radio button.
	
	 Choosing Standard optimizes your DVD project for an ordinary TV set, 
although it will still play on a widescreen with borders on either side in 
order to maintain the video’s proper resolution and aspect ratio (this is 
called pillar-boxing). Likewise, choosing Widescreen lets a DVD project 
play on an ordinary TV set with black borders at the top and bottom 
(called letter-boxing), but it will have a lower resolution than that seen 
on a widescreen TV.

Creating a submenu
If you have too many options on the title menu, the title menu can look clut­
tered. To fix this, you might need to create a submenu on your title menu 
and then place additional Slideshow or Movie options on this submenu. To 
create a submenu, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Project➪Add Submenu. 
	
	 A My Submenu button appears.

pages for the title menu.
	
7.	 (Optional) If the theme you choose has additional menu options, such 
as Extras or Chapters, use them for your submenu. 
	
	 Choose the menu option you want from the Themes browser; the sub­
menu changes to that option and keeps the titles, slideshows, or movies 
you’ve added.
Moving and deleting buttons
After you create a Slideshow, Movie, Submenu, or Text button on a menu, 
you can move or delete it. To move a button, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the button you want to move. 
	
	 The text inside your button appears highlighted. 
	
2.	 Click and drag your selected button to its new location and then

Rather than move a button, you might want to delete it. To delete a button, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the button you want to delete. 
	
	 The text inside your button appears highlighted. 
	
2.	 Choose Edit➪Delete. 
	
	 Your button disappears in an animated puff of smoke.
Defining opening content for your DVD
You can display a picture or a movie, the opening content, as soon as some­
one inserts your DVD into a DVD player. This opening content appears 
before the title menu appears. To define a picture or movie to display as the 
opening content, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose View➪Show Map (or click the Show the DVD Map icon, which 
looks like a miniature organization chart with a box connected to two 
other boxes).
	
	 The iDVD window displays a blank content box that displays the mes­
sage Drag Content Here to Automatically Play When the Disc Is Inserted, 
as shown in Figure 3-13.

Saving your iDVD project
After you design your DVD project, you can save your entire project in one 
of three ways:
	
✦	 As a DVD
	
✦	 As a disc image (.img) file
	
✦	 As files stored in a VIDEO_TS folder
Burning to a DVD
When you save your iDVD project to a DVD, you create a DVD that you can 
give to anyone to play on any DVD player. To burn an iDVD project to a DVD, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Insert a blank DVD into your Mac.
	
2.	 Choose File➪Burn DVD.

Saving to a disc image
As an alternative to saving an iDVD project to a DVD, you can also save an 
iDVD project to a disc image. A disc image is a single file that contains the 
entire contents of a drive or folder. By storing an iDVD project as a disc 
image, you can transfer a single (large) file to someone over the Internet; if 
you’re on a network, you can copy the file to another computer for storing 
or burning to a DVD. Then that person can open that disc image to retrieve 
the entire contents of your iDVD project and burn the disc image contents 
to a DVD.
To save your iDVD project to a disc image, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪Save as Disc Image. 
	
	 A Save Disc Image As dialog appears.
	
2.	 Type a descriptive name for your disc image in the Save As text box. 
	
3.	 Choose a location to store your disc image from the Where pop-up 
menu. 
	
4.	 Click Save.
Saving to a VIDEO_TS folder
You can also save your entire iDVD project inside a VIDEO_TS folder, which 
essentially lets you store the contents of your iDVD project as separate 
files stored in a folder. By storing a DVD in a folder, you can play your DVD 
directly off the hard drive. 
To save your iDVD project to a folder, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪Save as VIDEO_TS Folder. 
	
	 A Save VIDEO_TS Folder As dialog appears.
	
2.	 Type a descriptive name for your folder in the Save As text box.
	
3.	 Choose a location to store your folder from the Where pop-up menu. 
	
4.	 Click Save.
	
When you save an iDVD project as a VIDEO_TS folder, you can open and play 
the contents of that VIDEO_TS folder by using the DVD Player program in 
the Applications folder of any Mac. If you later decide to burn the contents 
of a VIDEO_TS folder to a DVD, make sure you burn the DVD in UDF format 
to create a DVD that can play in other DVD players.

In This Chapter
✓	Recording your music
✓	Playing instruments with Magic GarageBand
✓	Learning to play an instrument
✓	Using Loops
✓	Saving your music
✓	Saving ringtones
✓	Recording your podcasts
G
arageBand lets you record, play, alter, and arrange all kinds of sounds 
to create your own music. GarageBand provides accompanying instru­
ments (such as drums, keyboards, and guitars) that you can use to accom­
pany and complement recordings of your own music. Additionally, you can 
use these virtual instruments on their own to create new music, turning 
your Mac into a full-fledged band where you control the sound of each 
instrument, arrange the separate audio tracks, and smash them together 
to create your own hit songs. If you don’t know how to play an instrument, 
GarageBand offers guitar and piano lessons to get you started.
Although designed for recording, modifying, and playing music, GarageBand 
can record, modify, and save audio files in a number of audio file formats. If 
you’re not interested in making music, you can use GarageBand to clean up 
a recorded speech and save it as a podcast that you can distribute to the 
rest of the world.
Whether you want to record and arrange music or record speech, the main 
tasks for using GarageBand are
	
✦	 Recording audio
	
✦	 Arranging and modifying audio
	
✦	 Saving the finished audio file
Whatever your needs, GarageBand can satisfy your artistic side or your seri­
ous side, or just give you another way to amuse yourself with your Mac.

524
Recording Audio
Recording Audio
Because GarageBand works with audio, the first task is to record audio into 
GarageBand by using your Mac’s built-in microphone, an external micro­
phone, or audio input (such as a keyboard or guitar plugged directly into 
your Mac).
If you don’t have a real instrument, GarageBand provides a variety of soft­
ware instruments, which are basically musical instruments, such as pianos, 
guitars, and drums, that you can play and control through your Mac. All 
you have to do is specify the notes to play and the tempo and the software 
instruments let you hear your music played by the instruments you choose.
	
Apple sells additional Jam Packs, which provide additional software instru­
ments, such as ethnic instruments, vocalists, or symphony orchestras. 
Recording audio through Magic GarageBand
Magic GarageBand is great for creating background music quickly and easily. 
For example, if you’re creating a Keynote presentation to present to cow­
boys, you might want country music playing in the background. Rather than 
hunt down a country song, just fire up Magic GarageBand, pick the Country 
genre, modify the song by choosing different instruments, and you git your­
self an instant country song without even knowing how to play an instru­
ment. Wee-haw!
	
Each genre in Magic GarageBand only plays one stock song that you can 
modify. If you want a country song, Magic GarageBand creates the same 
country song. It’s up to you to customize this song to make it different. If you 
want to create your own country song, you’ll have to create a new music 
project rather than use Magic GarageBand.
To create a Magic GarageBand, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the GarageBand icon in the Applications folder (or click 
the GarageBand icon in the Dock).
	
	 The GarageBand chooser opens, as shown in Figure 4-1.
	
2.	 Click Magic GarageBand from the sidebar on the left.
	
	 Magic GarageBand shows different genre icons, such as Rock, Jazz, or 
Funk, as shown in Figure 4-2.
	
	 Move the pointer over a genre icon to make the Preview button appear 
(refer to Figure 4-2), and then click the Preview button to hear a snip­
pet or entire song played in your chosen genre. (Click the Preview radio 
button again to stop the song.)

Creating music with software instruments
Magic GarageBand can be handy for creating an instant song from a specific 
genre, but GarageBand also lets you specify notes so that GarageBand’s soft­
ware instruments can play your music.

Software instruments give you a chance to create music starting with one 
instrumental track and gradually layering other tracks until you’ve defined 
the parts for an entire band. To use software instruments, you need to spec­
ify the instrument you want to use, such as a baby grand piano or a steel 
string acoustic guitar. Then define the notes you want that instrument to 
play by using a virtual keyboard to click or press the notes.
To create a software instrument, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the GarageBand icon in the Applications folder (or click 
the GarageBand icon in the Dock).
	
	 The GarageBand chooser opens. (Refer to Figure 4-1.)

Playing with a real instrument
The easiest way to play music is with a real instrument connected to your 
Mac’s USB port. By playing with a real instrument, you can record yourself, 
alter the sound, and even save your recording so you can play along with 
your own recording. To record a real instrument connected to your Mac, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the GarageBand icon in the Applications folder (or click 
the GarageBand icon in the Dock) to open the GarageBand chooser 
window.
	
2.	 Double-click the Electric Guitar, Voice, or Acoustic Instrument icon, 
whichever is closest to the instrument you want to use.
	
	 A New Project from Template dialog appears.
	
3.	 Enter a descriptive name for your project in the Save As text box 
and then choose a location for storing your project from the pop-up 
menu.
	
4.	 Click Create.
	
	 A window appears displaying tracks associated with your chosen 
instrument alongside the Track Info pane, as shown in Figure 4-9.
	
5.	 (Optional) If you chose Voice, specify Male or Female and then choose 
an effect, such as Epic Diva or Male Rock, in the Track Info pane.

you’re 
using.
	
	
6.	 (Optional) If you chose Acoustic Instrument, click a specific instru­
ment type in the list on the right of the Track Info pane, such as 
Classic Rock or Metal.
	
	 The instrument you choose in this step defines how GarageBand plays 
your real instrument. For example, if you have a keyboard hooked up 
to your Mac, you can use this step to make your keyboard sound like 
horns, drums, or guitars.
	
7.	 Click the Input Source pop-up menu and choose how your instrument 
is connected to your Mac (such as through a USB port or other type of 
connection).
	
8.	 Click the Monitor pop-up menu and define whether you want to hear 
audio through the speakers.
	
	 To prevent feedback, choose On with Feedback Protection. If you still 
experience feedback, you might want to choose Off.
	
9.	 Drag the Recording Level slider to set the recording level, or click the 
Automatic Level Control check box to let GarageBand set the level.
	
	 Lowering the recording level can reduce feedback. If you select the 
Automatic Level Control check box, the Monitor option is disabled.
	
10.	 Click the Record button on your track and start playing away.
	
	 When you finish playing, click the Record button again.

Learning to play with a real instrument
You can learn piano or guitar basics with GarageBand music lessons. 
GarageBand provides 18 free lessons for learning piano and guitar.
	
Your first two free lessons are preloaded in GarageBand, and the remaining 
16 free lessons can be downloaded by clicking the Lesson Store in the 
GarageBand chooser window, then clicking the Basic Lessons tab and click­
ing on each additional lesson you want to download. Additionally, you can 
click the Artist Lessons tab and download optional lessons priced at $4.99 
each, brought to you by distinguished musicians including Sting, Norah 
Jones, John Fogerty, and Sarah McLachlan.
You can follow the lesson with your freestanding piano or guitar or with a 
keyboard or guitar hooked up to your Mac. To take a music lesson, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the GarageBand icon in the Applications folder or click 
the GarageBand icon in the Dock.
	
	 The GarageBand chooser appears.
	
2.	 Click Learn to Play in the sidebar on the left.

Using Loops
Say you want to add a song to your Web page or an intro to your podcast but 
don’t want to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star with the S-S F-F H-H G combina­
tion on your keyboard nor do you have a Fender Stratocaster for an attention-
grabbing riff. To easily create your own little ditty, you can use the Loops that 
come with GarageBand. You choose the instruments and the style effects and 
then combine the two into short jingles or even full-length songs. 
To create a song using Loops, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the GarageBand icon in the Applications folder (or click 
the GarageBand icon in the Dock).
	
2.	 Double-click Loops from the GarageBand chooser.
	
3.	 Enter a descriptive name for your project in the Save As text box and 
then choose a location for storing your project from the pop-up menu.

To record audio, click the Record button and start playing. GarageBand 
includes a metronome (Control➪Metronome) that you can toggle on and off. 
If you want to play along with previously recorded tracks, choose Control➪
Count In so you know when to start playing.
Splitting a track
When you first record an instrument, GarageBand saves it as a single, long track. 
To make it easier to edit this track, you can split a track into parts that you can 
modify individually, save and reuse, delete, or rearrange in a new position.
To split a track, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click to select a track that you want to split.
	
	 GarageBand highlights your chosen instrument.
	
2.	 Drag the slider (which displays a vertical red line) to where you want 
to split the track.
	
	 If you can’t find the slider, click the Go to Beginning button to move the 
slider to the beginning of your track.
	
3.	 Choose Edit➪Split or press Ô+T.

If you split a track, you can always join the parts again later. To join two 
adjacent parts of a track, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the first part of the track that you want to join.
	
2.	 Hold down the Shift key and then click the second part of the track 
you want to join.
	
3.	 Choose Edit➪Join or press Ô+J. 
	
	 GarageBand connects the two parts. 
Moving tracks
After you record two or more tracks, you might want to adjust how each 
track plays relative to one another. For example, you can make one track 
play before or after a second track to create interesting audio effects. To 
move tracks, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the track that you want to move. 
	
	 GarageBand highlights your selected instrument track.
	
	 For more flexibility, split a track into multiple parts so that you can 
move each part separately.
	
2.	 Click and drag the track to the left or right to adjust the relative posi­
tions of the two tracks.
	
3.	 Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the new 
arrangement of the track.
	
	 Figure 4-14 shows a before and after appearance of different tracks 
rearranged to start and end at different times.
Modifying the key and tempo
You can move tracks and/or regions in a GarageBand song to radically 
change how a song sounds, but you can also change the key or tempo to 
introduce a slight (or maybe even a major) change. Changing the key can 
modify how a song sounds, whereas changing the tempo speeds or slows a 
song without making the song sound high-pitched or running down.

After you finish arranging and modifying your song, you can choose File➪
Save to save your GarageBand project (so you can edit it later). However, 
if you want to share your creation with others, the most common ways you 
can save your audio file so you can share it with others are
	
✦	 As a song or ringtone in the iTunes library
	
✦	 As a song stored anywhere on your hard disk
	
✦	 On a CD
I provide the steps for sharing your song by saving it as a song or ringtone in 
iTunes, and to a disk or CD, in the following sections.
Saving a song in iTunes
If you create a song that you want to save and play later, you can store that 
song in iTunes by following these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Share➪Send Song to iTunes. 
	
	 A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 4-16.

3.	 Make sure the Compress check box is checked and then choose either 
AAC or MP3 Encoder from the Compress Using pop-up menu.
	
	 The Compress option compresses your audio file as small as possible 
while retaining audio quality. If, however, you plan to compile a col­
lection of songs that you want to burn to a CD, deselect the Compress 
check box so that your compilation is saved at the highest quality sound 
level, which provides the best listening experience when you play the 
CD with a CD player or on a computer.
	
4.	 Choose either Good, High, or Higher Quality from the Audio Settings 
pop-up menu.
	
5.	 Click Share.
	
	 Your song appears in your iTunes library.
Saving a song as a ringtone
Any of the songs you create can be used as ringtones for your iPhone. Just 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Share➪Send Ringtone to iTunes. 
	
2.	 GarageBand automatically converts your song and opens the iTunes 
application. 
	
3.	 Your song appears in the Ringtones library on iTunes, ready to be 
synched to your iPhone.
	
Ringtones can’t be more than 40 seconds. If your selection is too long, a 
dialog asks whether you want to adjust it. Click Adjust, and then drag your 
selection left or right so the start and end points for your selection include 
the segment you want to hear as a ringtone on your iPhone.
Saving a song to disk
If you don’t want to store your song in iTunes, you can save your song as a 
separate audio file that you can store anywhere, such as on an external hard 
disk or a USB flash drive. To save your song as an audio file, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Choose Share➪Export Song to Disk. 
	
	 A dialog appears.
	
2.	 Make sure the Compress check box is selected and then choose either

	 A dialog appears, telling you that it’s waiting for a blank CD. 
	
2.	 Insert a blank CD into your Mac and then click Burn.
Recording Podcasts
Podcasts are recorded audio files that contain speech, such as interviews, 
radio talk show broadcasts, or just monologues of a single person talking 
about anything. If you store your podcast on a Web site, anyone in the world 
can download and listen to your podcast.
To customize your podcasts, GarageBand lets you add other audio, picture, 
or video files using the Media Browser, which appears in the upper-right 
corner of the GarageBand window. 
Recording speech
The most important part about a podcast is recording spoken words, either 
through the internal microphone in your Mac, an external microphone 
plugged into your Mac, or even a recording of an iChat audio conversation 
using a program, such as Conference Recorder (www.ecamm.com), Audio 
Hijack Pro (www.rogueamoeba.com), or WireTap Studio (http://www.
AmbrosiaSW.com).

Adding jingles and audio effects
After recording you or someone else speaking, you might want to add music 
or sound effects to enhance your podcast. For example, you could have 
introductory music that fades when you start speaking.
	
To prevent any background jingles or audio effects from drowning out the 
spoken portion of your audio, GarageBand offers Ducking, a feature that 
reduces the background music volume level to 15-percent when the Male 
Voice or Female Voice track starts playing. To turn Ducking on or off, choose 
Control➪Ducking.
To add audio effects, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Control➪Show Loop Browser or click the View/Hide Loop 
Browser button in the lower-right corner of the GarageBand window 
(it’s the button with the icon that looks like an eye).

ture to represent separate chapters (parts) of your podcast. You can 
have only one picture in the Episode Artwork box, but you can have 
multiple pictures in the Artwork column.
	
5.	 (Optional) For each picture you place in the Artwork column, click the 
Time column and define when you want each picture to appear during 
your podcast.
As great as podcasts are, I’m suddenly reminded of that late ’70s song “Video 
Killed the Radio Star” by The Buggles. On that note (sorry, I couldn’t resist), 
keep in mind you can use iMovie to create lively videos featuring you as the 
star of the show while you sing along to music you create with GarageBand — 
which you can also post on YouTube so others can enjoy your talents. I show 
you how to use iMovie in Book V, Chapter 2.
	
When you finish editing your spoken audio and adding sound effects and pic­
tures, you’re ready to share your podcast with the world. Sharing a podcast 
is identical to sharing an audio file in iTunes, on your hard disk, or on a CD. 
For information about saving a podcast in different ways, refer to the previ­
ous section, “Saving Music.”

A
lmost everyone has a Web site these days. Some people use Web sites 
to publicize their businesses, and others use Web sites as their sole 
means of reaching customers, such as online sellers of books, food, or pet 
products. Some people run Web sites focusing on their favorite hobbies, 
such as gardening or Star Trek trivia. No matter what your interests and 
needs, setting up a Web site can be fun, rewarding, and perhaps profitable.
Although creating Web pages isn’t difficult, it’s not as straightforward 
as you might hope. That’s why Apple created iWeb, a special program 
designed to make creating Web pages easy, fun, and fast. With iWeb, you 
can create professional-looking Web pages in minutes instead of days. 
The Parts of a Web Page
A Web site is made of Web pages. Think of a Web page as an endless sheet 
of paper that you can stretch in all directions to make it as large or as small 
as you want. On this sheet, you can position text, pictures, graphics, movies, 
songs, and even programs for others to access. To help guide people around 
your Web pages, you add navigational aids called hyperlinks, also commonly 
called links. By clicking a link, people can jump from one Web page to another 
or from one location on a page to another location on that (or a different) 
Web page. Figure 5-1 shows the typical parts of a Web page.

Figure 5-1: 
A Web page

of text,

media.

Text
Navigation
The purpose of text
Text generally serves two purposes. First, text provides content on a Web 
page, such as a news story or a step-by-step description for how to bake a 
cake. Second, text is often used to create hyperlinks to other Web pages or 
to entirely different Web sites. 
To make text easy to find and read, you can add color, change the fonts 
and font sizes, or display text in different styles, such as bold and italics. 
Some Web pages might contain lots of text (such as a news site like The New 
York Times (www.nytimes.com), whereas others might contain a minimal 
amount of text, such as a Web site displaying photographs with text simply 
listing the photograph’s name or topic.
The purpose of graphics
Graphics can serve a purely decorative function, such as a company logo 
displayed in the corner of the Web page. Graphics can also be used as con­
tent and as hyperlinks.

Book V
Chapter 5
Building Web 
Sites with iWeb
Creating a Web Site with iWeb
549
As content, graphics provide information, such as photographs on a news 
site or pictures of your family on a personal site. Instead of showing pictures, 
some graphics can display decorative text in ways that ordinary text cannot 
produce. For example, a Web site for a plant nursery might have its name 
displayed in text or graphics. 
	
It’s impossible to search for text stored as a graphic image. That’s why many 
Web sites list an e-mail address as a graphic image; if they list that e-mail 
address as text, another computer can scan the Web site for text that con­
tains an e-mail address to send junk e-mail.
Finally, graphics, like text, are often used to create hyperlinks, such as 
menus that offer options for displaying different Web pages. Such graphic 
hyperlinks often provide you with a more colorful way to present hyperlinks 
than plain text, such as appearing as buttons or pull-down menus.
Putting together a Web page
To create a Web page with other programs, you have to learn the cryptic lan­
guage that creates Web pages, known as HTML (HyperText Markup Language). 
Because learning the HTML language just to create a Web page might be 
intimidating, iWeb simplifies this task by creating HTML code for you “behind 
the scenes.” All you have to do is arrange objects (text and graphics) on a 
Web page. 
Although you could create a Web page starting with a blank page, it’s far 
easier to create a Web page by modifying a predesigned one. With iWeb, 
you can choose from a variety of predesigned Web page templates, which 
already contain background graphics, text, and pictures that you can 
customize.
Creating a Web Site with iWeb
Every Web site contains one or more Web pages. To design a Web site, you 
need to decide how many Web pages you need, the purpose for each Web 
page, and the overall appearance you want to use for each Web page.
The number of Web pages you need can vary depending on the Web site’s 
purpose. If you’re putting together an online store to sell food, books, or pet 
supplies, you might need dozens (or even hundreds) of separate Web pages 
to display all your products. You can always add and delete Web pages 
when you need to.
After you know (approximately) how many Web pages you need, and what 
you want each Web page to offer, the next step is to pick a theme, which 
defines the overall appearance of each Web page, such as a background 
color or decorative graphic along the borders.

Picking a theme
A theme provides a consistent appearance for every Web page that makes 
up your Web site. One part of your Web site might list products for sale, so 
you might use one theme for product listings. Another part of your Web site 
might list company news so those Web pages might use a different theme. 
Themes simply help visually organize similar information. 
To pick a theme for your Web pages, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the iWeb icon in the Dock (or double-click the iWeb icon in the 
Applications folder.)
	
	 A dialog appears, listing different themes in the Theme list on the left 
and displaying the appearance of specific types of Web pages on the 
right, as shown in Figure 5-2.
	
2.	 Click a theme in the Theme list. 
	
	 Each time you click a different theme, the Web pages in the right pane 
show you how that new theme displays each type of Web page — 
Welcome page, About Me page, Photos page, whatever.
	
	 If you click the pop-up menu in the upper-left corner of the iWeb dialog, 
you can choose to see all themes or only those used with specific ver­
sions of iWeb, such as version 3.0, 2.0, 1.1, or 1.0.

3.	 Click one of the following types of Web pages in the right pane:
 
• Welcome: Introduces your Web site. The Welcome page is typically 
the first Web page visitors see when they visit a specific site, such as 
www.dummies.com.
 
• About Me: Describes yourself or your company.
 
• Photos: Displays digital pictures, such as those stored in iPhoto, for 
everyone to see.
 
• My Albums: Displays groups of different photo categories for people 
to browse.
	
•	 Movie: Displays a digital video that people can watch directly in your 
Web page.
 
•	 Blog: Provides space for typing your thoughts about different topics.
 
• Podcast: Displays lists of audio recordings (podcasts) that others can 
hear directly off your Web page.
 
• Blank: Provides a Web page that incorporates a specific theme so 
you can add anything you want to it.
	
4.	 Click Choose. 
	
	 The Web page that appears in the iWeb window is decked out in your 
chosen theme, as shown in Figure 5-3. You may see pictures of strange 
people and gibberish text. This is placeholder graphics and text, which 
you have to replace, which I explained in the “Designing a Web Page” 
section, later in this chapter.

Adding new pages
Because Web sites typically contain more than one Web page, you often need to 
add more Web pages to your Web site. To add a Web page, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Add Page icon at the bottom of the iWeb window or choose 
File➪New Page (or press Ô+N).
	
	 The list of available Web page templates appears with your current 
theme highlighted (refer to Figure 5-2).
	
2.	 Select a new page you want to add, such as Podcast or My Albums, 
and then click Choose.
	
	 Your new Web page appears in the iWeb window.
Deleting Web pages
If you add too many Web pages or suddenly find you don’t need a Web page 
after all, you can delete that Web page. To delete a Web page, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Click the Web page that you want to delete in the sidebar of the iWeb 
window.
	
2.	 Choose Edit➪Delete Page.
	
	 Your chosen Web page disappears, along with any text or graphics you 
stored on that Web page.
	
If you accidentally delete a Web page, press Ô+Z or choose Edit➪Undo to 
retrieve the deleted Web page.
Designing a Web Page
With the exception of the Blank Web page template, every iWeb template 
displays a Web page filled with placeholder text and graphic images that you 
can then replace with your own text and pictures.
Replacing placeholder text
Placeholder text gives you an idea of what the text might look like on the 
Web page. To change placeholder text, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 In the sidebar of the iWeb window, click the Web page that you want 
to modify.
	
	 Your chosen Web page appears in the right pane of the iWeb window.

2.	 Double-click the text you want to edit or replace.
	
	 Your chosen text appears highlighted.
	
3.	 Type new text or press the arrow and Delete keys to edit the existing text.
	
Instead of typing new text, you can always copy text from another program 
and paste it over the placeholder text.
Replacing placeholder graphics
Placeholder graphics give you some idea how a picture would work in a 
particular area of your page. To replace placeholder graphics with graphics 
of your own, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 In the sidebar of the iWeb window, click the Web page you want to 
modify.
	
	 Your chosen Web page appears in the right pane of the iWeb window.
	
2.	 Click the Show Media icon that appears at the bottom of the iWeb 
window or choose View➪Show Media. 
	
	 A Media Browser appears.
	
3.	 Click the Photos button. 
	
	 Your iPhoto library appears in the Media Browser, as shown in Figure 5-4.

4.	 Click and drag a picture you want to use to the placeholder graphic 
image you want to replace.
	
5.	 Release the mouse button. 
	
	 Your iPhoto picture now appears on your Web page.
	
6.	 Choose View➪Hide Media to close the Media Browser, or click the 
Hide Media button (it turns into the Show Media button).
Changing the Web page theme
You might modify a Web page with text and graphics and suddenly realize 
that you don’t like the theme you chose. To change a Web page’s theme 
while leaving your content (text and graphics you’ve added) unchanged, 
follow these steps: 
	
1.	 In the sidebar of the iWeb window, click the Web page you want to 
modify.
	
	 Your chosen Web page appears in the right pane of the iWeb window.
	
2.	 Click the Theme icon (fourth from left) that appears at the bottom of 
the iWeb window. 
	
	 A pop-up menu of themes appears, as shown in Figure 5-5.

Customizing the Parts of a Web Page
Making an iWeb template your own by replacing placeholder text and graph­
ics certainly makes creating Web pages easy, but eventually, you’ll come 
across a template that doesn’t have the text and graphics positioned exactly 
where you want them. To customize a Web page further, you need to know 
how to add, move, resize, delete, and arrange text and graphics on a Web 
page. You can modify existing objects or create new objects for storing text 
and graphics.
Moving an object
To move text or graphics to another part of your Web page, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Move the pointer over the text or graphics you want to move.
	
2.	 Click and drag the text or graphics to a new location.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button.
	
	 The text or graphics stays put in its new location.
Resizing an object
To resize text or graphics to make it bigger or smaller, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click to select the text or graphics you want to resize. 
	
	 Handles appear around your chosen object, as shown in Figure 5-6.
	
2.	 Move the pointer over a handle until the pointer turns into a two-way 
pointing arrow and then click and drag the handle to change the size 
of your object.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new size of the 
text or graphic object.
Rearranging an object
If you move or resize an object, it might cover another object, as shown in 
Figure 5-7. To fix this problem, you might need to rearrange which object 
appears over another one.

Think of each object (text or graphic) as a sheet of paper that can lie on or 
slide under another object.
To rearrange which object appears on top of another one, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Click to select the text or graphics that you want to place over (or 
under) another object.
	
	 Handles appear around your selected object.
	
2.	 Choose one of the following:
 
• Arrange➪Bring Forward: Moves the selected object over one object 
that might be overlapping it. If multiple objects cover your selected 
object, you might not see any difference.
 
• Arrange➪Bring to Front: Moves the selected object on top of all over­
lapping objects.
 
• Arrange➪Send Backward: Moves the selected object underneath one 
object that it may be covering.
 
• Arrange➪Send to Back: Moves the selected object underneath all 
other overlapping objects.

	 To select multiple objects, hold down the Shift key and click each object 
you want to delete.
	
2.	 Press Delete or choose Edit➪Delete.
	
If you delete an object by mistake, press Ô+Z or choose Edit➪Undo.

Working with text
Text always appears on a Web page inside a text box, which you can move 
and resize on a Web page. If you create a Web page from a template, it will 
likely have a text box on the page that you can fill with your own text. If you 
create a blank Web page, or need more room to display text, you may need 
to create a text box. 
Creating a text box
To create a text box, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Text Box icon at the bottom of the iWeb window or choose 
Insert➪Text Box.
	
	 A blinking cursor appears in the middle of your Web page.
	
2.	 Type your text.
	
	 If you have any existing objects on the Web page, the text box might 
appear over an existing object. When you type, you might have a hard 
time seeing your text, so press Ô+A to see your text.
	
3.	 Click anywhere on the Web page away from your newly created text box.
	
4.	 Click your newly created text box to display handles around it.
	
5.	 Click and drag to move and/or resize the text box.
Formatting text
After you type text inside a text box, you can format it by following these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the text box that contains the text you want to modify. 
	
2.	 Select the text you want to modify; alternatively, press Ô+A (or 
choose Edit➪Select All) to select all the text in the text box.
	
3.	 Choose Format➪Font.
	
	 A submenu of options appears, as shown in Figure 5-8.
	
4.	 Choose an option from the Font submenu, such as Bold or Show Fonts.
	
	 If you click the Fonts icon in the bottom-right corner of the iWeb 
window, a Fonts dialog appears, letting you pick a font to use.

Creating a text hyperlink
Besides making text look pretty inside a text box, you might also want to 
turn text into a hyperlink — the highlighted or underlined link that can jump 
a reader to another Web page or Web site. To create a hyperlink, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the text box that contains the text you want to turn into a 
hyperlink. 
	
2.	 Select the text you want to turn into a hyperlink.
	
3.	 Choose Insert➪Hyperlink to open the Hyperlink submenu, then select 
one of the following to display a Link pane similar to the one shown in 
Figure 5-9:
 
•	 Webpage: Links to a specific Web site, such as www.dummies.com.
 
• Email Message: Links to an e-mail address, such as JollyOldSaint
Nick@gmail.com.
 
• File: Links to a file, such as a PDF or text file, which others can 
download from your Web page.
	
Figure 5-9:

pane

your 
hyperlink.

4.	 Choose the options in the Link pane.
	
	 The options displayed in the Link pane will look different depending on 
the option you choose in Step 4. For example, if you choose Webpage, 
you need to type the Web site address to link to, such as www.
dummies.com. If you choose Email Message, you need to specify the 
e-mail address, such as MrsClaus@yahoo.com.
	
5.	 Click the Close button of the Link pane.
Working with graphics
You can add and place digital photographs, simple graphic shapes like 
arrows, or even videos anywhere on a Web page. If you create a Web page 
from a template, the template will likely provide placeholder graphics for you 
to add your own pictures. However, if you want to add more pictures, or if you 
started with a blank Web page, you can add more graphics to any Web page.
	
Graphics can take time to transfer over the Internet, so the more graphics 
you place on a Web page — and the larger the graphic images you use — the 
longer the Web page takes to load and display in someone’s Web browser. 
Don’t be afraid to use graphics, but don’t go overboard.
Adding a picture or movie to a Web page
Follow these steps to add either a picture or a movie to a Web page:
	
1.	 Click the Show Media icon at the bottom of the iWeb window.
	
	 The Media Browser appears.
	
2.	 Click the Photos or Movies tab, depending on which you want to add.
	
	 A list of pictures and movies stored on your Mac’s hard drive appears.
	
3.	 Navigate to the picture or movie you want, then click and drag the 
movie or picture to your Web page and release the mouse button.
	
	 Your chosen picture (or movie) appears on your Web page. (You might 
need to move or resize the picture.)
	
4.	 Select View➪Hide Media to close the Media Browser.
	
To insert pictures and movies, choose Insert➪Choose to open a file-browsing 
dialog, navigate to the file you want, click it, and then click the Insert button 
(or just double-click the file to insert it).
Adding a widget to a Web page
You might want to add a widget to your Web page; for example, a Google 
map that shows your store location or a countdown for an event that you’ll 
be hosting. To add a widget to a Web page, follow these steps:

	 The Media Browser appears.
	
2.	 Click the Widgets tab. 
	
	 A list of widgets appears in the Media Browser.
	
3.	 Click and drag a widget from the Media Browser to your Web page.
	
4.	 Release the mouse button. 
	
	 Your chosen widget appears on your Web page. (You might need to 
move or resize the widget or specify some information, such as an expi­
ration date or URL address, to make the widget function.)
	
5.	 Choose View➪Hide Media to close the Media Browser or click the 
Hide Media icon.
Publishing Your Web Pages
After you create one or more Web pages, they’re trapped on your computer 
until you upload them to the Internet where others can visit your Web pages 
with their Web browser. To publish your Web pages on the Internet, you 
typically need to transfer your Web page files to a Web site hosting service. 
This transfer is called uploading. If you’re wondering what kind of hosting 
service you need, here’s a quick rundown.
Types of Web site hosts
A Web site host is a bunch of computers with lots of humongous hard disks, 
called a server, connected to a really, really high-speed Internet connec­
tion (a T1 or T3 line). The main reason you need to store your Web pages 
on a server is that the fast T1 or T3 line allows thousands of people to view 
your Web site simultaneously. A typical home Internet connection isn’t fast 
enough to support (the potential hordes of) people who visit your Web site 
at the same time. 
Some popular Web site hosting options are
	
✦	 Free advertiser-sponsored Web site hosts
	
✦	 Free ISP (Internet Service Provider) Web site hosts
	
✦	 Fee-based Web site hosts
Free advertiser-sponsored Web site hosts
Many companies offer free Web hosting in exchange for displaying banner or 
pop-up ads all over your Web pages. If someone wants to visit your Web site, 
he or she might have to wade through some advertisements first.

Publishing Your Web Pages
562
The main problem with these types of hosts is that you can’t control what 
type of advertisements might appear on your Web site. If you create a Web 
site encouraging people to support the prevention of cruelty to animals, for 
instance, the Web site host might stick advertisements for fur coats or exotic 
animal foodstuffs all over your Web pages, and you can do nothing about it. 
Talk about sending the wrong signal!
Another drawback of free advertiser-sponsored Web site hosts is that the 
specific Web site address is never anything as simple as www.joehutsko.
com. Instead, free Web site hosts force you to use a Web site address that 
includes the Web site host name. So if you host your Web pages on a free 
site called Tripod or Geocities, your Web site’s address might look like this:
http://joehutsko.tripod.com 
or this:
http://blogger.joehutsko.com/
Unintuitive Web site addresses like these work just like the simpler, descrip­
tive www.joehutsko.com, but they’re hard to remember and even harder to 
type correctly. Telling someone to visit www.joe.com (or simply joehutsko.
com) is easy; telling someone to visit http://blogger.joehutsko.com is 
clumsy to say or write. 
	
By using a free Web hosting service, you can gain experience with designing 
and uploading your site. You can also see whether you have the stamina to 
maintain a Web site. Many people rush to create a Web site, furiously update 
it for the first week, and then gradually lose interest, eventually abandoning 
their site. You can use a free Web hosting service as a trial before spending 
money for a fee-based Web hosting service.
Not all free Web hosting services are equal. The amount of storage space 
and number of ads that appear on your Web pages differs from one to the 
next, so compare these services until you find one that you like best.
Free ISP Web site hosts
When you pay for Internet service from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), 
your ISP might throw in free Web site hosting — not all ISP’s offer free Web 
site hosting, some charge a fee, others don’t offer it at all. Free ISP Web site 
hosting services don’t put advertising on your Web site because the ISP 
figures that you’re already paying it for its service.
As a result, ISP Web site hosting gives you the benefits of experimenting 
with a free Web site without the drawbacks of unwanted advertisements. 

Book V
Chapter 5
Building Web 
Sites with iWeb
Publishing Your Web Pages
563
However, your Web site address might contain something convoluted and 
non-intuitive, such as http://www.ispname.net/joehutsko.
Web sites hosted on free ISP Web sites are more often used for personal use 
rather than setting up on-line stores. Some ISPs might even restrict busi­
nesses from setting up sites because of the bandwidth problems that might 
occur if too many people visit the Web site every day. 
	
Free Web site hosting services often limit the amount of storage space you 
can use. The less storage space available, the fewer Web pages, graphic 
images, and additional files (such as sound or video) you can put on your 
Web site. 
Fee-based Web site hosts
If you want a Web site with no ads, more storage space, and a descriptive 
Web site address (called a domain name), you need to pay a fee-based Web 
site hosting service.
	
Many advertiser-supported Web hosts offer both a free and a subscription-
based plan. These Web site hosting services give you the option of experi­
menting with designing a Web site under the free plan with a lengthy site 
address and later transferring the site to a registered domain name (like www.
joehutsko.com) without having to change Web site hosting companies.
The first step to using a fee-based Web site hosting service is to compare 
prices and features. Prices vary from $1.99 per month to more than $19.99 
per month depending on what additional options you might want. (What one 
Web site hosting service considers an option, another might throw in free as 
part of its basic package.) Some basic features to look for are
	
✦	 Storage space: The more storage space, the more Web pages, pictures, 
videos, and animation you can post on your Web site. Typical storage 
space ranges from 10GB to 250GB or more.
	
✦	 File transfer limitation: Defines how much data can flow from your Web 
site between the hosting service’s servers and the computers visitors 
use to visit your Web site. A high transfer rate might be necessary if you 
offer files for people to download, such as pictures or music files. 
	
✦	 Number of e-mail accounts: Consider whether you need a few e-mail 
accounts for your family members or 50 accounts for your company.
	
✦	 E-mail storage space: The more storage space, the more messages all 
your e-mail accounts can hold. If you don’t have enough e-mail storage 
space, you have to move them to your local disk or erase them to make 
room for new messages. 

Publishing Your Web Pages
564
	
✦	 Domain name registration: You need to register your particular Web 
site domain name so no one else can use it. Many Web hosting services 
include domain name registration. Otherwise, you have to register the 
domain name yourself.
	
✦	 Number of domain names: The price might include just one domain 
name or several domain names. 
After you pick a Web hosting service, you need to pick a domain name for 
your Web site. Many domain names are already taken (such as www.white
house.gov or www.dummies.com). After you decide on a descriptive 
domain name, you need to register it either through your Web site hosting 
service or through a separate domain name registration service.
	
To check whether a domain name is already taken, do a search on a site, 
such as Network Solutions (www.networksolutions.com).
Registration means picking a name that no one else is using, paying a one-time 
fee, and then paying periodic fees to maintain that domain name. If you don’t 
continue paying to maintain your domain name, you lose it. Registration fees 
typically cost $5 to $25 per year, although some Web site hosting services will 
pay this fee for you as long as you keep using their services.
	
After you pick a Web site hosting service and register a domain name, you 
can always transfer your domain name (and all your Web page files) to a 
different Web site hosting service that offers lower rates or better service. 
Uploading your Web pages
After you pick a Web hosting service and establish your Web address or reg­
ister a domain, you’re ready to upload, or publish, your Web pages.
iWeb has FTP capability built in, which makes uploading easy. FTP (File 
Transfer Protocol) is the most common way to transfer Web page files from 
your computer to a Web site server. Your Web hosting service provides the 
server address and username that are required for FTP uploads; the Web 
hosting service might also provide a password, and other parameters, such 
as a special directory, or a special communications protocol the Web site 
server requires to copy your Web pages to it. To upload your Web pages, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the sidebar of the iWeb window, click the name of the site you 
want to upload.
	
	 The Site Publishing Settings window appears, as shown in Figure 5-10.
	
2.	 Choose FTP Server in the Publish To pop-up menu.
	
3.	 (Optional) Type a site name and contact e-mail in the first two fields.

6.	 (Optional) If you have a Facebook account, select Update My Facebook 
Profile When I Publish This Site.
	
7.	 Click the Publish Site icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the iWeb 
window.
Using MobileMe
Besides automatically keeping your contacts, calendar, and Safari book­
marks synchronized between multiple Mac and Windows computers (and 
your iPhone or iPod Touch if you have one), Apple’s MobileMe service ($99 
per year) can also take the trouble out of finding a Web site hosting service 
to host your iWeb-created Web pages. 
To publish your Web site to MobileMe, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the sidebar of the iWeb window, click the name of the site you 
want to upload.
	
	 The Site Publishing Settings window appears (refer to Figure 5-10).

	 This name is used in the Web site address.
	
4.	 (Optional) Choose Make My Published Site Private if you want to limit 
access to your Web site with a password.
	
5.	 (Optional) Select Update My Facebook Profile When I Publish This Site 
if you have a Facebook account.
	
6.	 Click the Publish Site icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the iWeb 
window.
Making changes to your uploaded Web pages
A Web site is a dynamic creature, and you’ll probably want to change your 
Web pages to reflect changes in your business offerings or to show off 
pictures of your growing puppy. To upload revised Web pages, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 In the sidebar of the iWeb window, select the Web page you changed.
	
2.	 Click the Publish Site icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the iWeb 
window.
If you made changes to many Web pages and would rather re-upload the 
entire Web site, choose File➪Publish Entire Site.
	
Uploaded Web pages are blue in the iWeb sidebar; red Web pages haven’t 
been uploaded.

P
ages is a combination word processor and desktop publishing program. 
As a word processor, Pages lets you type, edit, and format text quickly 
and easily. As a desktop publisher, Pages lets you arrange graphics and text 
boxes on a page to create business cards, menus, newsletters, or brochures.
Because Pages offers a dual personality as a word processor and a desktop 
publishing program, you can switch between the features you need in a 
single program. You can start writing and then decide to design your pages. 
Halfway through designing your pages, you might feel the urge to write again. 
	
Pages is part of the iWork suite — and it ain’t free. Your Mac might have a 
trial version of Pages that lets you play with the program to see whether 
it meets your needs. If your Mac doesn’t have the trial version of Pages 
already installed, you can download it free from Apple’s Web site (www.
apple.com/iwork).
Working with Document Templates
To help you get started writing, Pages supplies a variety of document 
templates. By choosing a document template, you can just enter new text 
or customize the appearance of the template so you don’t have to create 
everything from scratch.

Working with Document Templates
570
Pages offers two types of templates: Word Processing and Page Layout. 
Word Processing templates are designed mostly for writing (relatively) 
plain and simple, while Page Layout templates are designed mostly for when 
you’re mixing text and graphics. (You can always add pictures to a Word 
Processing template or write in a text box on a Page Layout template.)
	
To wax philosophical for a moment, the difference between word processing 
and page layout is that word processing is suited for “continuous” docu­
ments, such as letters, reports, contracts (yawn), novels, and so forth. Page 
layout targets “page-centric” documents where different types of content 
(text, photos, tables, advertisements, for example) and the various contents’ 
positional considerations must all fit together nice and neat on the same 
proverbial page, such as flyers and brochures, newsletters, magazines, and 
catalogs, to name a few.
The main difference between Word Processing templates and Page Layout 
templates is that you can type directly on a page in a document created from 
a Word Processing template. If you want to type text on a document created 
from a Page Layout template, you have to create a text box and place that 
text box somewhere on your page.
A second difference is that you must manually add (or delete) pages in a 
Page Layout template (by choosing the Insert➪Pages or Edit➪Delete Page 
commands). With a Word Processing template, Pages automatically adds 
pages while you type and deletes pages while you delete text.
Generally, if you need a document that contains mostly text, such as letters 
or reports, start with a Word Processing template. If you need a document 
that consists mostly of pictures, or if you need to create newsletters, maga­
zine pages, or Web pages, start with a Page Layout template. 
	
After you create a document using a Word Processing (or Page Layout) tem­
plate, you can’t switch to a new template. If you want to use a different
template, you have to create another document. 
To choose a document template, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Pages icon in the Dock or double-click the Pages icon in the 
Applications folder (or choose File➪New on the menu bar if Pages is 
already running). 
	
	 A dialog appears, displaying different templates you can choose, as 
shown in Figure 1-1.
	
2.	 Select a template category under the Word Processing or Page Layout 
headings in the listing on the left.
	
	 The templates for your selected category appear in the main pane of the 
dialog.

3.	 Select a template and then click the Choose button (or double-click 
the icon for the template you want to use).
	
	 Pages opens your chosen template as a new, untitled document.
	
If you want to start with a blank document, click the Blank template category 
under the Word Processing heading.
	
Figure 1-1:

document 
quickly.
	
Replacing placeholder text
Nearly every template contains placeholder text that shows you gibberish 
that you have to replace with your own text. To change text in a template, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the placeholder text you want to change.
	
	 Pages selects the entire placeholder text, which can be as short as a 
single sentence or as large as several paragraphs, as shown in the news­
letter title selection in Figure 1-2.
	
2.	 Type any new text you want to replace the placeholder text.
Replacing placeholder pictures
Many templates display placeholder pictures. Unless you happen to like the 
picture included with a template, you’ll probably want to replace it with one 
of your own. The easiest way to add new pictures to your Pages document 

Working with Document Templates
572
(or replace placeholder pictures) is to drag and drop your new pictures from 
a Finder folder window. You can also add or replace pictures in Pages docu­
ments by following these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Media icon (the one displaying a musical note) on the tool­
bar or choose View➪Show Media Browser on the menu bar.
	
	 The Media Browser appears.
	
2.	 Click the Photos tab in the Media Browser to view all the pictures 
stored in iPhoto.
	
3.	 Click and drag a picture from the Media Browser to any placeholder 
picture in your document.
	
4.	 Release the mouse button. 
	
	 Pages replaces the placeholder picture with the picture you choose 
from the Media Browser, as shown in Figure 1-3.
	
5.	 Click the Close button on the Media Browser.

Working with Text
Text can appear directly on a page or inside a text box. Word Processing 
templates let you type text directly on a page, but you can always add text 
boxes and type text inside those text boxes later. Page Layout templates 
allow you to type text only inside text boxes.
	
You can always tell what type of template your document is based on by 
peeking at the title bar of the document window, which identifies your docu­
ment by name followed by either (Word Processing) or (Page Layout).
The advantage of typing text directly on a page is that you can keep typing 
and Pages automatically creates new pages while you type. The disadvan­
tage of typing text directly on a page is that it’s harder to define exactly 
where the text will appear on a page. 
The advantage of using text boxes is that you can move them anywhere on a 
page (or to a different page). The disadvantage of typing text in a text box is 
that text boxes can display only a limited amount of text. (If you need to type 
a large amount of text, you might need to link text boxes so that when text 
overflows one text box, it automatically flows into another one.)

Working with Text
574
Editing text
Whether you’re typing text directly on a page or inside a text box, you can 
edit text by adding, deleting, or rearranging it. 
Adding text
Any new text you type appears wherever the cursor is located. To add text, 
just place the cursor where you want the new text to appear, click, and then 
type away. 
Deleting text
You can delete text in two ways:
	
✦	 Move the cursor next to characters you want to erase and press 
Delete. Press the big Delete key (the one that appears to the right of the 
+/= key) to backspace over characters to the left of the cursor.
	
✦	 Select text and then press Delete. Select text by holding down the Shift 
key and moving the cursor with the arrow keys or by clicking and drag­
ging the mouse over the text to select it, and then press the Delete key.
Rearranging text
After you’ve written some text, you might need to rearrange it by copying or 
moving chunks of text from one location to another. You can copy and move 
text between two text boxes or from one part of a text page to another part 
of the same page — or to another page all together.
To copy and move text, you can use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands on 
the Edit menu, but you might find it quicker to select and drag text with the 
mouse. Here’s how it’s done:
	
1.	 Select the text you want to copy or move.
	
	 If you want to copy text, hold down the Option key while doing Step 2. If 
you want to move text, you don’t need to hold down any keys.
	
2.	 Click and drag the selected text to a new location.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button to finish copying or moving your text.
Formatting text
The text styles and images you choose for your document create the tone of 
what you want to communicate — businesslike, fun, weird, and so on. You 
can format text using fonts, styles, sizes, and colors. To give you fast access

to the formatting options, Pages displays a Format bar (see Figure 1-4) near 
the top of the Pages window. To view (or hide) the Format bar, choose 
View➪Show (or Hide) Format Bar.

✦	 Click the Font pop-up menu on the Format bar and then choose a font 
from the menu that appears.
	
✦	 Click the Style pop-up menu on the Format bar and then choose a style, 
such as Regular or Heading 1. (Choosing Bold or Italic from the Style pop-up 
menu is identical to clicking the Bold or Italic icon on the Format bar.)
	
✦	 Click the Font Size pop-up menu on the Format bar and then choose a 
size, such as 12 or 24.
	
✦	 Click the Text Color button on the Format bar. A color menu appears, as 
shown in Figure 1-5. Click a color to change the color of your selected text.
	
✦	 Click the Background Color button on the Format bar. A color menu 
appears, much like the one for the text color. Click a color to appear in 
the background of your selected text.
	
✦	 Click the Bold, Italic, or Underline icons on the Format bar.
	
If you suddenly change your mind about any of the formatting changes you 
make, choose Edit➪Undo on the menu bar or press Ô+Z to reverse the last 
changes.

Adjusting line spacing, justification, and margins
You can change how letters look by messing with the font, but you can also 
change the way a block of text looks by changing how it’s spaced on the 
page. In concrete terms, this means changing:
	
✦	 Line spacing: Defines how close together lines in a paragraph appear.
	
✦	 Text justification: Defines how text aligns within the left and right 
margins.
	
✦	 Margins: Defines the left and right boundaries that text can’t go past.
Changing line spacing
Line spacing used for most purposes typically varies from 0.5 to 2.0. (A value 
of 1.0 is single spacing, and a value of 2.0 is double spacing.) To change line 
spacing, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select at least two lines of text you want to modify.
	
2.	 Click the Line Spacing pop-up menu on the Format bar and then 
choose a number, such as 1.5 or 2.0, as shown in Figure 1-6.
	
Click Show More in the Line Spacing pop-up menu to choose spacing beyond 
the 0.5–2.0 range. Line spacing values less than 1.0, such as 0.5, can cause 
lines to overlap, which makes the text hard to read.
	
Figure 1-6: 
Line spacing 
can make 
text appear 
squashed or 
far apart.
	
Changing justification
The four types of justification are
	
✦	 Align Left: Text appears flush against the left margin but ragged along 
the right margin.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Creating Documents 
with Pages
Working with Text
577
	
✦	 Center: Each line of text is centered within the left and right margins, so 
text appears ragged on both left and right margins.
	
✦	 Align Right: Text appears flush against the right margin but ragged 
along the left margin.
	
✦	 Justify: Text appears flush against both the left and right margins, but 
extra space appears between words and characters.
Figure 1-7 shows four paragraphs. The first is aligned left, the second is cen­
tered, the third is aligned right, and the final paragraph is justified.
To set your text justification, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the text you want to modify.
	
2.	 Click the Align Left, Center, Align Right, or Justify icons on the 
Format bar.

Defining margins
The left and right margins only define text that appears on the page (Word 
Processing layout). The left and right margins of text boxes are defined by 
the text box size.
To define the left and right margins of text, you can use the ruler, which 
appears at the top of the Pages window. The ruler lets you define an exact 
location for your margins, such as placing the left margin exactly 1.5 inches 
from the left edge of the page.
To define the left and right margins of text, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the text you want to modify.
	
2.	 Click and drag the Left Margin marker to a new position on the ruler 
and then release the mouse button. 
	
	 The Left Margin marker looks like an upside-down blue triangle that 
appears on the left side of the ruler, as shown in Figure 1-8.
	
	 If the ruler isn’t visible, choose View➪Show Rulers.
	
3.	 Click and drag the Indent marker to a new position on the ruler and 
then release the mouse button. 
	
	 The Indent marker looks like a thin blue rectangle that appears over the 
Left Margin marker.
	
4.	 Click and drag the Right Margin marker to a new position on the ruler 
and then release the mouse button.
	
	 The Right Margin marker looks like an upside-down blue marker that 
appears on the right side of the ruler.

Dragging the Left Margin and Right Margin markers on the ruler is a fast way 
to adjust the margins, but for a more precise way, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the text you want to modify.
	
2.	 Click the Inspector icon in the upper-right corner of the Pages window 
or choose View➪Show Inspector from the menu bar. 
	
	 The Inspector icon looks like a little “i” in a blue circle. When you click 
the icon, an Inspector window appears.
	
3.	 Click the Text Inspector icon (the big T).
	
4.	 Click the Tabs tab, as shown in Figure 1-9.
	
5.	 Enter a value in the First Line, Left, or Right text box or click the up 
and down arrows to choose a value.
	
6.	 Click the Close button of the Text Inspector window.

Using Formatting Styles
You might have a favorite way to format text. Although you could manually 
change each formatting feature, you might find it faster and easier to use 
styles instead. Formatting styles store different types of formatting that you 
can apply to text. Pages’ Word Processing and Page Layout templates have 
formatting styles stored already. When you create your own documents, you 
can create formatting styles, too. By using formatting styles, you can format 
text quickly and easily.
Applying styles
The following are the types of styles you can apply to text:
	
✦	 Paragraph styles affect an entire paragraph where the end of a para­
graph is defined by a line that ends where you press Return.
	
✦	 Character styles affect characters or words.
	
✦	 List styles affect multiple lines of text where each line of text ends where 
you press Return. (Think To-Do lists or bullet points.)
Using a paragraph style
To apply a paragraph style, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the text (or move the cursor inside the text box) you want to 
modify.
	
2.	 Click the Paragraph Styles button.
	
	 It’s a gray button with a paragraph symbol and a downward pointing 
arrow on the far left of the Format bar. A menu of available paragraph 
styles appears, as shown in Figure 1-10.
	
	 If you can’t see the Format bar, choose View➪Show Format Bar. 
	
3.	 Choose a style.
	
	 Pages formats your entire paragraph.

2.	 Click the Character Styles button. 
	
	 It’s a gray button with a small letter “a” and a downward pointing arrow 
on the far left of the Format bar. A menu of available character styles 
appears, as shown in Figure 1-11.
	
3.	 Choose a style.
	
	 Pages formats your selected text.
	
	Some character styles, such as Emphasis and Italics, work identically as the 
Bold and Italics buttons on the far right of the Format bar.

Using the Styles Drawer
For a fast way to select paragraph, character, or list styles, use the Styles 
Drawer. The Styles Drawer slides out from the right or left of a Pages docu­
ment (depending on where the Pages window is placed on your desktop) 
and displays different styles to use while showing how text appears in each 
style. By using the Styles Drawer, you can quickly pick a style to format text.
To use the Styles Drawer, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the text you want to modify.
	
2.	 Click the View icon and then select Show Styles Drawer from the drop-
down menu (or choose View➪Show Styles Drawer from the menu bar).
	
	 The View icon is above the left corner of the Format bar. A drawer 
appears, listing all the available styles, as shown in Figure 1-13.
	
3.	 Click a style in the Styles Drawer.
	
	 Your text takes the characteristics of your selected style.
	
4.	 Click the View icon and then select Hide Styles Drawer from the drop-
down menu to hide the Styles Drawer.
Creating temporary styles
Pages provides paragraph, character, and list styles, but you might need to 
format text in a certain way that Pages doesn’t offer. In that case, you can 
copy the style from existing text and paste that style to format other text 
automatically.

5.	 On the menu bar, choose Format➪Paste Character Style (or Paste 
Paragraph Style).
	
	 Pages copies your style to the text you select in Step 4.
Saving a formatting style
If you format text a certain way repeatedly, you might want to save your 
formatting as a style that appears in the Styles Drawer. That way, you can 
choose that style later by clicking on the name of your saved style.
To save your own style in the Styles Drawer, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Format text in a certain way, such as changing the fonts and font size.
	
2.	 Click (or move the cursor) inside the formatted text.
	
3.	 Click View➪Show Styles Drawer to open the Styles Drawer.

To delete a style from the Styles Drawer, Control-click the style and then 
choose Delete Style. When a dialog appears, click the pop-up menu to choose 
a style to format text currently formatted by the style you want to delete. 
Then click Replace.
Creating and Placing Text Boxes
Text boxes hold text that you can place anywhere on a page (even in the 
middle of other text). You can create and place text boxes on both word pro­
cessing and page layout documents.
Creating a text box
To create a text box, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Insert➪Text Box on the menu bar or click the Text Box icon.

Moving a text box
After you create a text box, you’ll probably want to move it. To move a text 
box, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click a text box to select it.
	
	 A border with handles appears around the text box, as shown in 
Figure 1-15.
	
2.	 Click and hold down on the text box border and drag the text box to 
its new location.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button when you arrive at your destination.

Resizing a text box
Sometimes a text box is too large or small for the text you type inside. To fix 
this problem, you can resize a text box by following these steps:
	
1.	 Click anywhere inside the text box.
	
2.	 Move the pointer to a handle until the pointer turns into a two-way 
pointing arrow.
	
3.	 Click and drag a handle to resize the text box.
	
4.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the size of the 
text box.
Creating linked text boxes
If you type more text than a text box can display, you see a Clipping Indicator 
icon — it appears as a plus sign inside a square at the bottom of the text 
box, as shown in Figure 1-16.

Creating and Placing Text Boxes
586
When you see the Clipping Indicator at the bottom of a text box, you have 
two choices. You can resize the text box so it can display more text, as 
described in the preceding section. This might not always be practical 
because you might not want to expand a text box.
Alternatively, you can link text boxes. Linked text boxes allow text from one 
text box to flow into another text box.

Linking text boxes
To link text boxes, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click a text box that displays a Clipping Indicator at the bottom.
	
	 Blue tabs appear on the sides of the text box. 
	
2.	 Click the blue tab on the right of the text box.
	
	 A message appears, telling you to click an existing text box or anywhere 
on the page to create a new text box, as shown in Figure 1-17.

Unlinking text boxes
After you link two or more text boxes, you might decide you don’t want 
linked text boxes after all. To unlink text boxes, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the text box that you want to unlink from another text box.
	
2.	 Do one of the following:
 
• On the menu bar, choose Format➪Text Box➪Break Connection into 
Text Box.
 
• Move the pointer to the end of the connection line, hold down the 
mouse button, drag the mouse away from the text box, and then

Wrapping text around a text box
A new text box often appears near other text. To prevent a text box you 
add from covering other text, you need to wrap the (already present) text 
around the new text box. To define how to wrap text around a text box, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click a text box.
	
2.	 Click the Inspector icon or choose View➪Show Inspector on the 
menu bar.
	
	 The Inspector icon looks like a little “i” in a blue circle in the upper-right 
corner of the Pages window. The Inspector window appears.
	
3.	 Click the Wrap Inspector button.
	
	 It appears to the left of the big “T” button. The Wrap Inspector options 
appear, as shown in Figure 1-19.
	
4.	 Select the Object Causes Wrap check box.
	
5.	 Click a text wrap button.
	
	 The five different text wrap buttons are
 
• Wrap Text on the Left
 
• Wrap Text Around
 
• Wrap Text on the Left or Right (whichever has more space)
 
• Wrap Text Above and Below

1.	 Click the picture you want to mask.
	
	 Handles appear around your chosen picture.
	
2.	 Choose Format➪Mask (or Format➪Mask with Shape) on the menu bar 
and then choose a shape, such as Right Triangle or Star.
	
	 Your chosen mask appears over your picture, as shown in Figure 1-21.
	
3.	 Move the pointer to the mask handles and then click and drag the 
handles to resize the mask.
	
4.	 Move the pointer to the dimmed portion of the picture outside the 
mask and then click and drag the dimmed part to adjust which part of 
the picture appears within the mask.
	
5.	 Click Edit Mask.
	
	 Pages displays your completed masked picture, as shown in Figure 1-22.
	
If you drag the slider above the Edit Mask button, you can resize the picture 
to make it larger or smaller.

Turning a picture transparent with Instant Alpha
The Instant Alpha feature lets you cut away parts of a picture. For example, 
if you have a picture of a person’s face, you might want to trim away the back­
ground image of the wall so you see only the person’s face and not the wall.
To use the Instant Alpha feature, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the picture you want to modify. 
	
	 Handles appear around your chosen picture.
	
2.	 Choose Format➪Instant Alpha on the menu bar.
	
	 A dialog appears over your picture, telling you how to use the Instant 
Alpha feature.
	
3.	 Click and drag your mouse over the portion of your picture that you 
want to make transparent (such as the sky).
	
	 Pages highlights all parts of your picture that are similar in color to the 
area that you originally pointed to, as shown in Figure 1-23.
	
4.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the portion of the 
picture that the Instant Alpha feature has highlighted and turned 
transparent. 
	
You can use the Instant Alpha feature multiple times to remove different 
colors from the same picture.

Polishing Your Document
When you finish designing your document, you’re ready to show it to the 
world. Of course, before you show your document to others, you should 
spell check your document. Fortunately, Pages is happy to help you check a 
document’s spelling. Then you can choose to save your document in a vari­
ety of formats to ensure that others can read it.
Spell checking a document
Pages can spell check your entire document, including text trapped inside 
text boxes and shapes. To spell check an entire document, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 Choose Edit➪Spelling➪Spelling on the menu bar.
	
	 (If you choose Edit➪Spelling➪Check Spelling, Pages highlights mis­
spelled words but doesn’t offer any suggestions.)
	
	 A dialog appears, highlighting misspelled words and offering possible 
corrections, as shown in Figure 1-24.
	
2.	 Choose one of the following:
 
• Change: Changes the misspelled word with the word selected in the 
list box.
 
• Find Next: Looks for the next misspelled word.
 
• Ignore: Skips the misspelled word.
 
• Learn: Stores the selected word in Pages’ dictionary
 
• Define: Launches Mac’s Dictionary program, then looks up and dis­
plays the word’s definition in the Dictionary’s main window.
 
• Guess: Offers best-guess word choices.
	
3.	 Click the Close button of the Spelling dialog at any time to make it 
go away.
	
	
Pages can check your spelling while you type. The moment Pages identifies a 
misspelled word, it underlines it with a red dotted line. If you Control-click any 
word underlined with a red dotted line, Pages displays a shortcut menu of cor­
rectly spelled words that you can choose. If you want to turn off spell checking 
while you type, choose Edit➪Spelling➪Check Spelling as You Type to clear the 
check mark in front of this command.

Figure 1-24: 
The Spelling 
dialog lets 
you pick 
from a list 
of correctly 
spelled 
words.
	
	
It’s a good idea to proofread your document even after spell-checking 
because the spell checker only makes sure the word is correctly spelled. If 
you type, “I have to dogs,” when you really meant to type, “I have two dogs,” 
no spell checker on earth is going to flag that.
Exporting a document
When you choose File➪Save, Pages saves documents in its own proprietary 
file format. However, if you want to share your Pages documents with others 
who don’t have the Pages program, you need to export your document into 
another file format, such as
	
✦	 PDF: Saves your document as a series of static pages stored in the 
PDF Adobe Acrobat file format that can be viewed (but not necessarily 
edited) by any computer with a PDF viewing program.
	
✦	 Word: Saves your document as a Microsoft Word file, which can be opened 
by any word processor that can read and edit Microsoft Word files.
	
✦	 RTF: Saves your document as a Rich Text Format (RTF) file, which many 
programs can open and edit.
	
✦	 Plain Text: Saves your document as text without any formatting or 
graphic effects. 

Book VI
Chapter 1

Polishing Your Document

The PDF file format preserves formatting 100 percent, but doesn’t let anyone 
edit that file unless they use a separate PDF editing program, such as 
Acrobat Pro. If someone needs to edit your document, both the Word and 
RTF options preserve Pages documents well. The Plain Text option is useful 
only if you can’t transfer your Pages document to another program as a 
Word or RTF file.
To export a Pages document, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪Export on the menu bar.
	
	 A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-25.
	
2.	 Select an option, such as Word or RTF, and then click Next. 
	
3.	 In the new dialog that appears, enter a name for your exported docu­
ment in the Save As text box.
	
Figure 1-25: 
The Export 
dialog lets 
you choose 
a format 
to save

4.	 Select the folder where you want to store your presentation.
	
	 You might need to switch drives or folders until you find where you 
want to save your file.
	
5.	 Click Export.
	
When you export a document, your original Pages document remains 
untouched in its original location.

I
f you need to inform or convince a group of people about a subject, you 
often need to make a presentation. Although you could give a presenta­
tion just by talking, sometimes it’s hard to emphasize certain points and ideas 
through words alone. That’s why you need the presentation program Keynote.
Keynote can take the hassle out of creating, organizing, and giving a presen­
tation so you can concentrate more of your time on talking to an audience 
and less of your time fumbling around with jammed slide projectors, white­
boards, and felt markers that stain your fingertips.
Best of all, Keynote can spice up your presentation by including audio and 
visual effects, from playing music and movies to showing visually interesting 
effects — stuff like text sliding across the display or dissolving away into 
nothingness. Such effects help get your point across and hold an audience’s 
attention. 
	
Keynote comes as part of the iWork suite. Your Mac might come with a trial 
version of iWork, which lets you try Keynote to see whether you might find 
it useful before you lay out money to buy it.
Creating a Presentation
An entire Keynote presentation consists of one or more slides, where each 
slide displays information to make a single point. Each slide typically 

Creating a Presentation
598
contains text, as shown in Figure 2-1, although graphics, video, and audio 
can make an appearance as well.
To make your slides more interesting to watch, you can also add transition 
effects that appear when you switch from one slide to another. To empha­
size the information on a particular slide, you can add individual visual 
effects to specific items, such as making text rotate or making a graphic 
image glide across the screen and halt in place. 
The basic steps to creating a presentation in Keynote involve
	
1.	 Picking a theme to use for your presentation.
	
2.	 Creating one or more slides.
	
3.	 Typing text or placing graphics on each slide.
	
4.	 (Optional) Adding an audio or video file to each slide.
	
5.	 (Optional) Adding visual effects to animate an entire slide or just the 
text or graphics that appear on that slide.
The rest of this chapter goes into detail about each of these steps.

Choosing a Theme for a New Presentation
599
Choosing a Theme for a New Presentation
A presentation consists of multiple slides. Although you could create a 
generic presentation where plain black text appears against a white back­
ground, this can be boring. To spice up your presentation, Keynote provides 
predesigned background graphics called themes, which provide a consistent 
appearance for your slides, such as the font, size, style, and background color.
To pick a theme, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the Keynote icon in the Applications folder or click the 
Keynote icon in the Dock (or choose File➪New on the menu bar if 
Keynote is already running).
	
	 The Theme Chooser dialog opens, as shown in Figure 2-2.
	
2.	 Click a theme and then click the Choose button or double-click a 
theme.
	
	 Keynote creates the first slide of your presentation using your chosen 
theme. At this point, you can add text, graphics, audio, or video to the 
slide or you can add new slides.
	
If you want to change your theme after you open a new presentation, click 
the Themes icon on the Keynote toolbar and choose a different theme.

provides 
a variety

for your

Changing Presentation Views
After you create a presentation, Keynote offers four ways to view a 
presentation:
	
✦	 Navigator: Useful for editing individual slides and manipulating all the 
slides in an entire presentation.
	
✦	 Outline: Useful for viewing and editing just the text that appears on 
slides, as shown in Figure 2-3.
	
	 Note: In the Navigator and Outline views, the Slide Organizer appears to 
the left of the individual slide being viewed or edited.
	
✦	 Slide Only: Useful for editing the text and graphics of a single slide, as 
shown in Figure 2-4.
	
✦	 Light Table: Useful for manipulating a large number of slides in a pre­
sentation, as shown in Figure 2-5.
To switch to a different view, choose the View icon on the Keynote toolbar 
and then choose Navigator, Outline, Slide Only, or Light Table.

Working with Slides
When you create a new presentation, that presentation contains just one 
slide. Because you usually need more than one slide to create a presenta­
tion, you probably want to add more slides. If you go overboard and add too 
many slides, you can always winnow a few.

Working with Slides
602
	
When working with slides, you often need to select multiple slides in the 
Slide Organizer pane or the Light Table view. Hold down the Ô key to click 
and select multiple slides. Hold down the Shift key and click two different 
slides to select a range of slides.
Adding a slide
To add a slide to a presentation, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click a slide in the Slide Organizer pane or the Light Table view.
	
	 Your new slide appears directly after the slide that you click and has the 
same theme.
	
2.	 Choose one of the following to add a new slide:
 
•	 Click the New (+) icon.
 
• Choose Slide➪New Slide on the menu bar.
 
• Click a slide in the Slide Organizer pane or Light Table view and then 
press Return.
 
• Control-click a slide in the Slide Organizer pane and then choose 
New Slide.
Using Masters
Each Keynote theme has a selection of slide layouts, or Masters, already 
designed, which use the colors and style of the theme. To use Masters asso­
ciated with a theme, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click a slide in any of the views. 
	
2.	 Click the Masters icon on the Keynote toolbar and then choose the 
template for the type of slide you want to create.
	
	 For example, you might choose Title & Bullets or Photo – Vertical.
Rearranging slides
Keynote displays slides in the order they appear in the Slide Organizer. The 
top slide appears first, followed by the slide directly beneath it, and so on. 
After you create two or more slides in a presentation, you might want to 
rearrange their positions. 
To rearrange slides in a presentation, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose one of the following:
 
• View➪Navigator (Displays slides vertically in the Slide Organizer pane.)
 
• View➪Light Table (Displays slides in rows and columns.)

	 In Navigator view, Keynote displays a horizontal line with a downward-
pointing arrow to show you where your slide will appear when you 
release the mouse button, as shown in Figure 2-6. In Light Table view, 
Keynote moves slide icons out of the way to show you where your new 
slide will appear.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new position of 
the slide in your presentation.
Deleting a slide
Eventually, you might find that you don’t need a slide anymore. To delete a 
slide, go to the Slide Organizer pane or Light Table view, select the slide(s) 
that you want to delete, and then choose one of the following:
	
✦	 Press Delete.
	
✦	 Choose Edit➪Delete on the menu bar.
	
✦	 Control-click a slide in the Slide Organizer pane and then choose Delete.
	
If you delete a slide by mistake, choose Edit➪Undo Delete on the menu bar 
(or press Ô+Z).

Working with Slides
604
Manipulating Text
Text appears on a slide in a text box. Most slides contain two text boxes, 
where the top text box defines the title of a slide and the bottom text box 
displays the bullet points of a slide (refer to Figure 2-1).
The title of a slide typically defines the purpose of the slide, and the bullet 
points underneath provide supporting ideas. A slide can have only one Title 
text box and one Bullet Point text box, but each Bullet Point text box can 
contain multiple bullet points.
Editing text 
Initially, every slide contains an empty Title text box and an empty Bullet 
Point text box, but you’ll want to replace these items with your own words 
and bullets. To place text on a slide, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose View➪Navigator on the menu bar.
	
2.	 In the Slide Organizer pane, click the slide that you want to edit. 
	
	 Your chosen slide appears.
	
3.	 Double-click the placeholder text that appears in the Title or Bullet 
Point text box. 
	
4.	 Type text or use the arrow keys and Delete key to edit existing text.
	
To ensure you don’t give a presentation filled with typos and misspelled words, 
check the spelling in your presentation by choosing Edit➪Spelling➪Spelling.
Formatting text
After you create text, you can format it by changing fonts, font size, or color. 
Formatting sets the tone of your presentation — upbeat, serious, fun, or 
businesslike.
	
Use fonts and colors sparingly. Using too many fonts or colors can make 
text harder to read. When choosing colors, make sure you use colors that 
contrast with the slide’s background color. For instance, light yellow text 
against a white background is nearly impossible to read.
Changing fonts
To change the font of text, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Slide Organizer pane, select the slide that contains the text you 
want to modify.
	
2.	 Double-click the text box that contains the text you want to modify.

The top of the Colors window provides a variety of different color pickers 
that display colors as sliders, color spectrums, or even crayons. So if you 
don’t like the color wheel, click a different color picker and use that one.
Adding a chart
Sometimes presenting your information as a chart makes your information 
easier to understand. To add a chart to a presentation, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Create a new slide or click an existing slide in the Slide Organizer or 
Light Table view.
	
2.	 Click Insert➪Chart from the menu bar, or click the Charts icon on 
the Keynote toolbar, and then choose the type of chart you want to 
create — bar, pie, 2-D or 3-D, for example.
	
	 A chart appears and the Chart Inspector opens along with the Chart 
Data Editor, as shown in Figure 2-9.

you want the data to appear, such as a number or a percentage.
	
	 If you decide that you want to remove a chart, click it and press Delete.
Adding Media Files
Text by itself can be as monotonous and confusing to read as the flight 
arrival and departure displays at an airport. To make your presentation 
more appealing and communicative, add sound, pictures, and movies. 
Sound can be an audio recording of a song stored in iTunes or edited in 
GarageBand; pictures can be digital photographs stored in iPhoto; and 
movies can be short video clips you’ve edited and stored in iMovie. 
Adding sound
You can add any audio file stored in iTunes or GarageBand. To add sound to 
a slide, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Slide Organizer pane, click the slide where you want to play an 
audio file.
	
2.	 Click the Media icon on the Keynote toolbar. 
	
	 The Media Browser appears.

Modifying a picture
Keynote provides two ways to modify the appearance of a picture: Masking 
and Instant Alpha. Masking lets you display just a portion of an image, such 
as an oval or star-shaped area. Instant Alpha lets you make part of an image 
transparent so that the background of a slide can be seen through an image.
Masking a picture
A mask acts like a cookie cutter that you plop over a picture to save any­
thing inside the cookie cutter shape but hide anything outside the shape. 
Keynote provides a rectangular mask and a variety of other shaped masks, 
such as ovals, stars, arrows, and triangles. 
To apply a mask on a picture, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Slide Organizer pane, click the slide that contains the picture 
you want to mask.
	
2.	 Click the picture you want to mask. 
	
	 Handles appear around your chosen picture.
	
3.	 Choose Format➪Mask on the menu bar (or Format➪Mask with Shape) 
and then choose a shape, such as Polygon or Diamond. 
	
	 Your chosen mask appears over your picture, as shown in Figure 2-13.

dims the 
rest.

4.	 Click and drag a mask handle to resize the mask.
	
	 Holding down the Shift key while dragging a mask handle retains the 
height and width aspect ratio.
	
5.	 Move the pointer to the dimmed portion of the picture outside the 
mask and then drag the dimmed portion to adjust which part of the 
picture appears within the mask.
	
6.	 Click the Edit Mask button.
	
	 Keynote masks your picture, as shown in Figure 2-14.
	
You can apply only one mask on a picture at a time. If you want to apply a 
different mask over a picture, you must remove the first mask by choosing 
Format➪Unmask.
Making a picture transparent with Instant Alpha
Keynote’s Instant Alpha feature lets you remove a portion of a picture. This 
can create unusual visual effects by stripping unwanted portions of a picture 
and keeping the parts you like.

	 Keynote highlights all parts of your picture that are similar in color to 
the area that you originally pointed to, as shown in Figure 2-15.
	
5.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the portion of the 
picture that the Instant Alpha feature has highlighted and made 
transparent.

You can use the Instant Alpha feature multiple times to remove different 
colors from the same picture. If you make a mistake, choose Edit➪Undo 
Instant Alpha on the menu bar or press Ô+Z.
Creating Transitions and Effects
To make your presentations visually interesting to watch, you can add 
transitions and effects. Slide transitions define how a slide appears and dis­
appears from the display. Text and graphic effects define how the text or 
graphic initially appears on or disappears from the slide and how it moves 
around a slide. 
Creating a slide transition
To create a slide transition, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose View➪Navigator on the menu bar.
	
2.	 In the Slide Organizer pane, click the slide that you want to display 
with a transition.
	
3.	 On the menu bar, choose View➪Show Inspector (or click the 
Inspector icon).
	
	 An Inspector window appears.
	
4.	 Click the Slide Inspector icon (shown in Figure 2-16) in the Inspector 
window and then click the Transition tab.

5.	 Click the Effect pop-up menu and then choose an effect, such as 
Shimmer or Confetti. 
	
	 The Magic Move effect animates an object, moving it from its location 
on one slide to a new location on the next slide. The object must be the 
same on both slides. Place the object at the starting point on the first 
slide and then on the end point on the second slide. The Magic Move 
feature moves the object when the slide transitions from the first slide 
to the second slide.
	
	 The Slide Inspector gives you a preview of what your transition will 
look like.
	
	 Choose None in the Effect pop-up menu to remove a transition.
	
6.	 (Optional) Depending on the transition effect you choose, you might 
need to define other options, such as the direction or duration of your 
transition.
	
7.	 Click the Close button of the Inspector window.
Creating text and graphic effects
Keynote offers three ways to create text and graphic effects:
	
✦	 Build In: Defines how text and graphics enter a slide. (If you choose
the Build In transition, initially, the text and graphics won’t appear 
on the slide.)
	
✦	 Build Out: Defines how text and graphics exit a slide.
	
✦	 Action: Defines how text and graphics move on a slide.
To define an effect for text or graphics, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose View➪Navigator on the menu bar.
	
2.	 In the Slide Organizer pane, click the slide that contains the text or 
graphic you want to display with a visual effect.
	
3.	 Click the text or graphic you want to modify.
	
	 Handles appear around your chosen text or graphic.

Polishing Your Presentation
618
Polishing Your Presentation
When you finish modifying the slides in your presentation, you’ll need to 
show your presentation to others. You might give a presentation in person or 
just pass out your presentation to others so they can view it at their leisure.
Viewing a presentation
After you finish creating a presentation, you need to view it to see how it 
actually looks. The slide order or visual effects might have looked good 
when you put your presentation together, but when viewed in its entirety, 
you might suddenly notice gaps in your presentation. To view a presenta­
tion, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Slide Organizer pane, click the first slide you want to view.
	
	 If you click the first slide of your presentation, you’ll view your entire 
presentation. If you click a slide in the middle of your presentation, your 
slideshow begins from that slide and proceeds until it reaches the last slide.
	
2.	 Click the Play icon on the Keynote toolbar or choose Play➪Play 
Slideshow on the menu bar.
	
	 The slide you choose in Step 1 appears.
	
3.	 Click the mouse button or press the spacebar to view each successive 
slide.
	
	 If you’re at the last slide of your presentation, clicking the mouse button 
or pressing the spacebar exits your presentation.
	
4.	 (Optional) Press Esc if you want to stop viewing your presentation 
before reaching the last slide.
Rehearsing a presentation
Viewing a presentation lets you make sure that all the slides are in the right 
order and that all effects and transitions work as you expect. Before giving 
your presentation, you might want to rehearse it and let Keynote approxi­
mate how much time you spend on each slide.
	
Rehearsing can give you only a guess of the time needed to give your pre­
sentation. In real life, the audience and conditions, for example an impatient 
audience sitting in a stuffy conference room where the air conditioning sud­
denly breaks down, might make you nervous or speed up your timing. 
To rehearse a presentation, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose View➪Navigator on the menu bar. 
	
2.	 In the Slide Organizer pane, click the first slide you want to view.

4.	 Practice what you’re going to say when presenting each slide and 
then press the spacebar or click the mouse button to advance to the 
next slide.
Exporting a presentation
When you give a presentation, you’ll probably do it directly from your Mac. 
However, there might come a time when you need to save your presentation 
to run on a different type of computer. Fortunately, Keynote lets you save 
(or export) a Keynote presentation in one of the following file formats:
	
✦	 QuickTime: Saves your presentation as a movie that can play on a 
Windows PC or Mac computer that has the free QuickTime player. This 
movie preserves all transitions and visual effects.
	
✦	 PowerPoint: Saves your presentation as a PowerPoint file that you can 
edit and run on any computer that runs PowerPoint. (Certain visual 
effects and transitions might not work in PowerPoint.)

✦	 PDF: Saves your presentation as a series of static images stored in the 
Adobe Acrobat portable document file format that can be viewed by any 
computer with a PDF viewing program. Any interesting visual or transi­
tion effects between slides will be lost.
	
✦	 Images: Saves each slide as a separate graphic file.
	
✦	 HTML: Saves each slide as a separate Web page. Any interesting visual 
or transition effects between slides will be lost.
	
✦	 iPod: Saves your presentation as a movie specially designed to play on 
an iPod. 
	
If you want to preserve your visual effects and transitions, save your presen­
tation as a QuickTime or iPod movie. If you want to preserve and edit your 
presentation on a Windows PC running Microsoft PowerPoint, save your pre­
sentation as a PowerPoint file.
To export a Keynote presentation, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪Export on the menu bar.
	
	 A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-20.
	
2.	 Click an option, such as the QuickTime or PowerPoint icon.

N
umbers is a spreadsheet program designed to help you manipulate 
and calculate numbers for a wide variety of tasks, such as balancing 
a budget, calculating a loan, and creating an invoice. The Numbers program 
also lets you create line, bar, and pie charts that graphically help you 
analyze and understand what your data means. 
Understanding the Parts of a Numbers Spreadsheet
A Numbers spreadsheet consists of one or more sheets, which are com­
pletely blank like an empty sheet of lined paper made up of rows and col­
umns. The intersection of a row and column is a cell, which is where you 
type and store numbers, text, and formulas, as shown in Figure 3-1. 
Besides the mundane but fundamental cells that act as the backbone of any 
spreadsheet, you can also place the following eye-catching (and useful) 
items in your spreadsheets, as shown in Figure 3-2:
	
✦	 Tables
	
✦	 Charts
	
✦	 Text boxes
	
✦	 Pictures
A table consists of rows and columns that can contain words, numbers, 
calculated results, or a combination of all two or all three of these types of 
contents.

A chart displays data stored in a table. Common types of charts are line, bar, 
pie, and column charts, as shown in Figure 3-3. With Numbers, you can build 
2-axis and mixed charts, too.

625
	
Figure 3-3: 
Numbers 
can create 
different 
types of 
charts to 
help you 
visualize the 
meaning of 
your data.
	
Text boxes and pictures serve mostly decorative functions. In a text box, you 
type and store text independent of the rows and columns in a table. With 
pictures, you add decorative images on a sheet, such as a company logo. 
Numbers helps you manipulate numbers and present your information in a 
visually appealing way.
Putting together a spreadsheet is a simple process. The following list points 
out the highlights:
	
✦	 Start with a sheet. When you create a new Numbers file, either from 
scratch or by using a template, Numbers automatically creates one 
sheet with one table on it. Your job is to fill that table with data. Add 
more tables — yes, a sheet can hold multiple tables — or start spicing 
up your data presentation with charts or pictures. (More on that later.)
	
✦	 Fill a table with numbers and text. After setting up at least one table 
on a sheet, you can move the table around on the sheet and/or resize it. 
When you’re happy with the table’s position on the sheet and the table’s 
size, you can start typing numbers into the table’s rows and columns. 
Don’t forget to type titles for your rows and columns to identify what 
those numbers mean, such as “August Sales” or “Screwdrivers Sold.” 
	
✦	 Create formulas and use functions. After you type numbers in a table 
along with titles, you’ll want to manipulate one or more numbers in 
certain ways, such as adding a column of numbers. Numbers offers 

Creating a Numbers Spreadsheet
626
a slew of predefined functions to take your numbers and calculate a 
result, such as how much your company made in sales last month or 
how a salesperson’s sales results have changed.
	
	 Formulas not only calculate useful results, but they also let you enter 
hypothetical numbers to see possible results. For example, if every 
salesperson improved his or her sales results by 5 percent every month, 
how much profit increase would that bring to the company? By typing 
in different values, you can ask, “What if?” questions with your data and 
formulas.
	
✦	 Visualizing data with charts. Just glancing at a dozen numbers in a row 
or column might not show you much of anything. By turning numeric 
data into line, bar, or pie charts, Numbers can help you spot trends in 
your data.
	
✦	 Polish your sheets. Most spreadsheets consist of rows and columns 
of numbers with a bit of descriptive text thrown in for good measure. 
Although functional, such spreadsheets are boring to look at. That’s why 
Numbers gives you the chance to place text boxes and pictures on your 
sheets to make your information (tables and charts) compelling.
Creating a Numbers Spreadsheet
To help you create a spreadsheet, Numbers provides 30 templates that you 
can use as-is or modify. If you prefer, you can use the Blank template to create 
a spreadsheet (one sheet with one table) from scratch. If you design a par­
ticularly useful spreadsheet, you can even save it (by choosing File➪Save as 
Template) as a template to use in the future.
To create a spreadsheet based on a template, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the Numbers icon in the Applications folder or click the 
Numbers icon in the Dock (or choose File➪New on the menu bar 
if Numbers is already running).
	
	 The Template Chooser dialog opens, as shown in Figure 3-4.
	
2.	 Click a template category in the list on the left, double-click the tem­
plate that you want to use, or click a particular template displayed in 
the main pane, and then click Choose. 
	
	 Numbers opens your chosen template, which you can fill in with rows 
and columns of numbers you want to calculate, or text you want to asso­
ciate with numbers that you want to sort by alphabetical order, or by 
highest to lowest number, or the other way around.
	
	 If you want to start with a blank spreadsheet, click the Blank template in 
the list on the left.

such as 
Personal or 
Business.
	
Working with Sheets
Every Numbers spreadsheet needs at least one sheet. A sheet acts like a 
limitless page that can hold any number of tables and charts. Ideally, you 
should use sheets to organize the information in your spreadsheet, such 
as using one sheet to hold January sales results, a second sheet to hold 
February sales results, and a third sheet to hold a line chart that shows each 
salesperson’s results for the first two months. 
	
To help organize your sheets, Numbers stores the names of all your sheets 
in the Sheets pane on the left. Indented underneath each sheet is a list of all 
tables and charts stored on that particular sheet. 
To view the contents of a specific sheet, click that sheet name in the Sheets 
pane. To view a particular table or chart, find the sheet that contains that 
table or chart. Then click that specific table or chart.
Adding a sheet
You can always add another sheet if you need one. When you add a sheet, 
Numbers creates one table on that sheet automatically. To add a sheet, 
choose one of the following:
	
✦	 Choose Insert➪Sheet on the menu bar.
	
✦	 Control-click anywhere inside the Sheets pane and choose New Sheet.
	
✦	 Click the Sheet icon that appears above the Sheets pane.

Working with Sheets
628
Deleting a sheet
If you need a sheet to go away, clear out, disappear, whatever, you can 
delete it. When you delete a sheet, you also delete any tables or charts 
stored on that sheet. To delete a sheet, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the sheet you want to delete in the Sheets pane.
	
2.	 Choose one of the following:
 
• Press the Delete key.
 
• Control-click a sheet name and then choose Delete Sheet.
 
• Choose Edit➪Delete on the menu bar.
	
	 A dialog appears, asking whether you really want to delete the sheet.
	
3.	 Click Delete (or Cancel).
Adding a table or chart
A sheet can hold one or more tables and charts. When you add a table or 
chart, the table or chart is blank. To add a table or chart, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Sheets pane, click the sheet where you want to add a table 
or chart.
	
2.	 Choose one of the following and select an option:
 
• Click the Tables icon (or choose Insert➪Table on the menu bar). 
The Tables menu appears, as shown in Figure 3-5.
 
• Click the Charts icon (or choose Insert➪Chart on the menu bar). The 
Charts menu appears, as shown in Figure 3-6.

Deleting a table or chart
When you create a table or chart, you don’t have to keep it forever. Keep in 
mind, though, that when you delete a table, Numbers deletes all data (numbers, 

Book VI

text, and formulas) stored on that table. If you created a chart that depends on 
those numbers you deleted, your chart will no longer display whatever informa­
tion it displayed before you deleted the table.
	
Figure 3-6: 
The Charts 
menu lists 
different 
types of 
charts you 
can add.
	
To delete a table or chart, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Sheets pane, click the table or chart you want to delete.
	
2.	 Choose one of the following:
 
• Press the Delete key.
 
• Control-click a table or chart and then choose Delete.
 
• Choose Edit➪Delete on the menu bar. 
Naming sheets, tables, and charts
Numbers gives each sheet, table, and chart a generic name, such as Sheet 2, 
Table 1, or Chart 3. To help you better understand the type of information 
stored on each sheet, table, and chart, use more descriptive names, espe­
cially when you add multiple tables and charts (which you find out about 
later in this chapter). 

Setting Up Tables
630
To name a sheet, table, or chart in the Sheets pane, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose one of the following:
 
• Double-click a sheet, table, or chart name. 
 
• Control-click a sheet, table, or chart name and then choose Rename.
	
2.	 Type a new name or use the arrow keys and the Delete key to edit an 
existing name.
Setting Up Tables
Just as you set the dinner table to accommodate the number and size of 
your guests — remember the children’s table at Thanksgiving? — you set 
your Numbers table to accommodate your data. You define the number of 
rows and columns your table needs based on the quantity of data you have 
to enter. You set the row height and column width based on the kind of data 
you have as well as the font style and size you choose.
Adding rows and columns
When you add a table to a sheet, Numbers opens a table that’s four columns 
by ten rows. This may be too small, or too big, for your data. If you know you 
want a bigger — or smaller — table, you use the Resize corner to add or sub­
tract rows and columns. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Sheets pane, click the table that you want to resize. 
	
	 Numbers displays your selected table with handles around it.
	
2.	 Click anywhere inside the table. 
	
	 The table displays column and row headings, a Move corner (in the 
upper-left corner of the table), and a Resize corner (in the bottom-right 
corner of the table), as shown in Figure 3-7.
	
3.	 Move the pointer to the Resize corner in the bottom-right corner of 
the table.
	
4.	 Click and drag the Resize corner to resize the table on the sheet.
	
	 While you drag the Resize corner, you add (or delete) rows or columns 
or both.
	
5.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the table’s number 
of rows and columns.

Inserting a row or column
You’re entering your data and suddenly you realize you need to add a row or 
column in the middle of your table. No sweat.
To add a row or column in the middle of a table, click a cell where you want 
to insert another row or column, choose Table and then choose one of the 
following from the Table menu: 
	
✦	 Add Row Above: Inserts a new row directly above the selected cell.
	
✦	 Add Row Below: Inserts a new row directly below the selected cell.
	
✦	 Add Column Before: Inserts a new column to the left of the selected cell.
	
✦	 Add Column After: Inserts a new column to the right of the selected cell.
To insert multiple columns or rows, highlight two or more column or row 
headings to equal the number of rows and columns you want to add, click 
the Table menu, and then choose Add Columns Before/After or Add Rows 
Above/Below.
	
If you move the pointer to a row or column heading (such as column D or 
row 5), a downward-pointing arrow appears, which you can click to display a 
menu. From this menu, you can choose any of the options in the preceding list.

Deleting a row or column
To delete a row or column, choose one of the following:
	
✦	 Click a cell inside the row or column you want to delete and then choose 
Table➪Delete Row (or Delete Column).
	
✦	 Control-click a cell inside the row or column you want to delete, and 
then choose Delete Row (or Delete Column) from the shortcut menu.
	
✦	 Move the pointer over the row or column heading (such as column A 
or row 3), click the downward-pointing arrow that appears, and then 
choose Delete Row (or Delete column).
	
You can delete multiple columns or rows by highlighting those column or 
row headings, clicking the Table menu, and then choosing Delete Columns 
or Delete Rows.
Resizing rows and columns
Just as a new table opens with ten rows and four columns, the cells in those 
rows and columns have preset widths and heights. However, a small cell 
might not show all the information stored in that cell. To fix this problem, 
you can resize rows and columns.
Resizing the fast way
To resize a row or column using the mouse, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Move the pointer to the border between two row or column headings, 
such as between columns A and B. 
	
	 The pointer turns into a two-way pointing arrow around a vertical or 
horizontal line.
	
2.	 Click and drag the mouse up/down or right/left to resize the row 
or column. 
	
3.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the size of your 
row or column.
	
If you have data stored inside a row or column, Numbers can automatically 
resize the row or column to fit the largest item stored in that row or column. 
To resize a row or column, click a cell inside the row or column you want to 
resize and choose Table➪Resize Columns to Fit Content (or Resize Rows to 
Fit Content).

Formatting a table
To make your table easier to read, you can format it with a style, which 
provides ways to color row and column headings of an entire table with one 
click of the mouse. To format a table, follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Sheets pane, click the table that you want to format. 
	
	 Numbers displays your chosen table.
	
2.	 Click a formatting style, such as Ledger or Blue Headers, in the Styles 
pane in the bottom-left corner of the Numbers window. 
	
	 Numbers formats your table. If you don’t like the way your table looks, 
choose another of the ten styles available.
Resizing a table
You might need to resize a table to fit it in a small space or to make it larger 
and easier to read. You can make a table larger (or smaller) while retaining 
the same number of rows and columns, which increases (or decreases) the 
height and width of rows and columns. 
To stretch or shrink a table (without adding or subtracting rows or col­
umns), follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Sheets pane, click the table that you want to resize. 
	
	 Numbers displays your selected table with handles around it.
	
2.	 Move the pointer to a handle until the pointer turns into a two-way 
pointing arrow.
	
3.	 Click and drag a handle to enlarge or shrink the table. 
	
	 Notice that any data inside the table grows or shrinks as well.
	
4.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the size of your table.
Moving a table
After creating a table on a sheet, you can move it around to better highlight 
your data, especially if you have other tables, charts, or images on the sheet. 
To move a table, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 In the Sheets pane, click the table that you want to move. 
	
	 Numbers displays your selected table.
	
2.	 Click anywhere inside the table. 
	
3.	 Move the pointer to the Move corner (refer to Figure 3-7) until the 
pointer turns into a four-way pointing arrow underneath.

4.	 Click and drag the table to a new location on the sheet.
	
5.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the table’s new 
location.
Typing Data into Tables
When you’re ready to enter your data, you need to know about the three 
types of data you can store inside a table: 
	
✦	 Numbers
	
✦	 Text
	
✦	 Formulas
	
You must type an equal sign “=” at the start of a formula you type into a cell 
so that Numbers recognizes the contents of the cell as a formula and not a 
number value or text item. 
To type anything into a table, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select a cell by clicking it or by pressing the arrow keys.
	
2.	 Type a number, text, or formula (which must be preceded by an equal 
sign “=”).
	
3.	 Press Return to select the cell below, press Tab to select the cell to the 
right, or click any cell where you want to type new data.
	
4.	 Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for each additional item you want to type into 
the table.
Formatting numbers and text
When you type a number in a cell, the number will look plain, such as 45 or 
60.3. To make your numbers more meaningful, you should format them. For 
example, the number 39 might mean nothing, but if you format it to appear 
as $39.00, your number now clearly represents a dollar amount.
To format numbers, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click to select one cell or click and drag to select multiple cells.
	
	 Numbers draws a border around your selected cell(s).
	
	 If you select empty cells, Numbers automatically formats any numbers 
you type into those cells.

Typing formulas
The main purpose of a table is to use the data (such as numbers, textual 
data, and dates and times) you store in cells to calculate a new result, such 
as adding a row or column of numbers. To calculate and display a result, you 
need to store a formula in the cell where you want the result to appear.

Typing Data into Tables
638
Numbers provides three ways to create formulas in a cell:
	
✦	 Quick formulas
	
✦	 Typed formulas
	
✦	 Functions
Using Quick Formulas
To help you calculate numbers in a hurry, Numbers offers a variety of Quick 
Formulas that can calculate common results, such as
	
✦	 Sum: Adds numbers.
	
✦	 Average: Calculates the arithmetic mean.
	
✦	 Minimum: Displays the smallest number.
	
✦	 Maximum: Displays the largest number.
	
✦	 Count: Displays how many cells you select.
	
✦	 Product: Multiplies numbers.
To use a Quick Formula, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select two or more cells that contain numbers.
	
2.	 Click the Function icon, or choose Insert➪Function on the menu 
bar, and then choose a Quick Formula (Sum, Average, Minimum, 
Maximum, Count, or Product).
	
	 Numbers displays your calculated results.
	
If you highlight a row of numbers, the Quick Formula displays the result 
to the right. If you highlight a column of numbers, the Quick Formula displays 
the result at the bottom of the column. If you highlight both rows and 
columns of numbers, the Quick Formula displays the result at the bottom 
of each column. 
Typing a formula
Quick Formulas are handy when they offer the formula you need, such as 
adding rows or columns of numbers with the Sum formula. However, most of 
the time, you need to create your own formulas.
Every formula consists of two parts:
	
✦	 Operators: Perform calculations, such as addition (+), subtraction (–), 
multiplication (*), and division (/).
	
✦	 Cell references: Define where to find the data to use for calculations.

Book VI
Chapter 3

A typical formula looks like this:
= A3 + A4
This formula tells Numbers to take the number stored in column A, row 3 
and add it to the number stored in column A, row 4.
To type a formula, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click (or use the arrow keys to highlight) the cell where you want the 
formula results to appear.
	
2.	 Type =. 
	
	 The Formula Editor appears, as shown in Figure 3-12.
	
	 You can move the Formula Editor if you move the pointer to the left end 
of the Formula Editor. When the pointer turns into a hand, click and 
drag the Formula Editor to a new location.
	
3.	 Click a cell that contains the data you want to include in your 
calculation.
	
4.	 Type an operator, such as * for multiplication or / for division.
	
5.	 Click another cell that contains the data you want to include in your 
calculation.
	
Figure 3-12: 
The Formula 
Editor lets 
you create 
and edit 
a formula 
stored in a 
cell.
	
	
6.	 Repeat Steps 4 and 5 as often as necessary.
	
7.	 Click the Accept (or Cancel) button on the Formula Editor when 
you’re done.
	
	 Numbers displays the results of your formula. If you change the num­
bers in the cells you define in Step 3 and Step 5, Numbers calculates a 
new result instantly.

For a fast way to calculate values without having to type a formula in a cell, 
you can use Instant Calculations. Just select two or more cells that contain 
numbers and you can see the instant calculations in the bottom-left corner 
of the Numbers window, as shown in Figure 3-13.
	
Figure 3-13: 
Instant 
calculations

	 Instant calculations
Using functions
Typing simple formulas that add or multiply is easy. However, many calcula­
tions can get more complicated, such as trying to calculate the amount of 
interest paid on a loan with a specific interest rate over a defined period.
To help you calculate commonly used formulas, Numbers provides a library 
of functions — prebuilt formulas that you can plug into your table and define 
what data to use without having to create the formula yourself. 
To use a function, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click (or use the arrow keys to highlight) the cell where you want the 
function results to appear.
	
2.	 Click the Function icon.
	
	 A pull-down menu appears.
	
3.	 Choose Show Function Browser.
	
	 A Functions Browser opens, as shown in Figure 3-14. It displays all the 
available functions along with a definition for each one.
	
4.	 Click a function category in the left pane, such as Financial or 
Statistical. 
	
	 The right pane displays only those functions stored in that category.

5.	 Click a function in the right pane and then click the Insert button. 
	
	 The Formula Editor appears, containing your chosen function. 
	
6.	 Edit the formula by typing the cell names (such as C4) or clicking the 
cells that contain the data the function needs to calculate.
	
7.	 Click the Accept (or Cancel) button on the Formula Editor. 
	
	 Numbers shows your result.
Formatting data entry cells
After you create formulas or functions in cells, you can type new data in the 
cells defined by a formula or function and watch Numbers calculate a new 
result instantly. Typing a new number in a cell is easy to do, but sometimes 
a formula or function requires a specific range of values. For example, if you 
have a formula that calculates sales tax, you might not want someone to 
enter a sales tax over 10% or less than 5%.
To limit the types of values someone can enter in a cell, you can use one of 
the following methods, as shown in Figure 3-15:
	
✦	 Sliders: Lets the user drag a slider to choose a value within a fixed 
range.

Typing Data into Tables
642
	
✦	 Steppers: Lets the user click up and down arrows to choose a value that 
increases or decreases in fixed increments.
	
✦	 Pop-up menus: Lets the user choose from a limited range of choices.
	
Figure 3-15: 
Sliders, 
steppers, 
and pop-up

types of 
values a cell 
can hold.
	
Formatting a cell with a slider or stepper
A slider or stepper is useful when you want to restrict a cell to a range of 
values, such as 1 to 45. The main difference between the two is that a slider 
appears next to a cell, whereas a stepper appears inside a cell.
To format a cell with a slider or stepper, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click a cell that you want to restrict to a range of values.
	
2.	 Click the Format button (it looks like a downward-pointing arrow) on 
the Format bar and then choose Slider or Stepper from the pull-down 
menu that appears, as shown in Figure 3-16. 
	
	 The Cells Inspector appears, as shown in Figure 3-17.
	
3.	 Click the Minimum text box and type the minimum acceptable value.
	
4.	 Click the Maximum text box and type the maximum acceptable value.
	
5.	 Click the Increment text box and type a value to increase or decrease 
by when the user drags the slider or clicks the up and down arrows of 
the stepper.

a value or using the slider to define a value. If you choose a value out­
side the minimum and maximum range defined in Steps 4 and 5, the cell 
won’t accept the invalid data.
Formatting a cell with a pop-up menu
A pop-up menu restricts a cell to a limited number of choices. To format a 
cell with a pop-up menu, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click a cell that you want to restrict to a limited choice of values.
	
2.	 Click the Format button (it looks like a downward-pointing arrow) on 
the Format bar. 
	
	 A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 3-16).

Deleting data in cells
After you type data into a cell, you might later want to delete that data. 
Numbers provides two ways to delete data in cells:
	
✦	 Delete data but retain any formatting.
	
✦	 Delete data and formatting.
To delete data but retain any formatting, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select one or more cells that contain data you want to delete.
	
2.	 Press Delete or choose Edit➪Delete on the menu bar.
To delete both data and formatting in cells, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select one or more cells that contain data and formatting you want 
to delete.
	
2.	 Choose Edit➪Clear All on the menu bar.
Making Charts
Charts help make sense out of your numeric data by turning numbers into 
pictures that can show trends or help you spot patterns, such as identifying 
which salesperson is most consistent (and which ones are consistently the 
best and worst). 
Creating a chart
Creating a chart is a three-step process. First, you have to decide what 
numeric data you want to turn into a chart. Second, you need to choose a spe­
cific type of chart to create, such as a mixed bar and line chart or pie chart. 
Finally, you have to decide whether you want to create a two-dimensional or 
three-dimensional chart.

✦	 Control-click a chart name in the Sheets pane and then choose Delete.
Making Your Spreadsheets Pretty
Tables and charts are the two most crucial objects you can place and 
arrange on a sheet. However, Numbers also lets you place text boxes, 
shapes, and pictures on a sheet. Text boxes can contain titles or short 
descriptions of the information displayed on the sheet; shapes can add color 
or indicate navigational cues, such as arrows; and pictures can make your 
entire sheet look more interesting.

Sharing Your Spreadsheet
You’ve put a lot of effort into making your spreadsheet presentable. Now’s 
the time to actually present it, which usually means sharing your spread­
sheet with others by printing it or saving it as a file.
Printing a spreadsheet
In other spreadsheet programs, you can print your spreadsheet and chart — 
only to find that part of your chart or spreadsheet is cut off by the edge of 
the paper. To avoid this problem, Numbers displays a Content Slider, which 
lets you magnify or shrink an entire sheet so that it fits and prints perfectly 
on a page.
To shrink or magnify a sheet to print, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 In the Sheets pane, click the name of a sheet you want to print. 
	
2.	 Choose File➪Show Print View (or View➪Show Print View).
	
	 Numbers displays a page and shows how the charts and tables on your 
sheet will print, as shown in Figure 3-21.

5.	 Choose the print options you want and then click Print.
Exporting a spreadsheet
When you choose File➪Save, Numbers saves your spreadsheet in its own 
proprietary file format. If you want to share your spreadsheets with others 
who don’t have Numbers, you need to export your spreadsheet into another 
file format, such as:
	
✦	 PDF: Saves your spreadsheet as a series of static pages stored in the 
Adobe Acrobat portable document format that can be viewed by any 
computer with a PDF viewing program.
	
✦	 Excel: Saves your spreadsheet as a Microsoft Excel file, which can be 
opened and edited by any spreadsheet that can read and edit Microsoft 
Excel files.

	 A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 3-22.
	
2.	 Click an icon, such as PDF or Excel.
	
3.	 (Optional) Click Security Options if you want to add a password to 
open, print, or copy the document.
	
4.	 Click Next. 
	
	 A dialog appears, letting you choose a name and location to save your 
exported spreadsheet.
	
5.	 Enter a name for your exported spreadsheet in the Save As text box.
	
6.	 Click the folder where you want to store your spreadsheet. 
	
	 You might need to switch drives or folders until you find where you 
want to save your file.
	
7.	 Click Export.
	
	 When you export a spreadsheet, your original Numbers spreadsheet 
remains untouched in its original location.

Chapter 1: Managing Contacts 
with Address Book
In This Chapter
✓	Setting up Address Book
✓	Organizing names in groups
✓	Archiving and printing your Address Book
✓	Importing and exporting contacts
M
ost people write down important names and contact information in 
an address book, but your Mac comes with an electronic version 
called (surprise!) Address Book. Besides storing contact names and related 
contact information, the Address Book also connects with other programs 
so that you can click someone’s e-mail address and immediately write and 
send a message to that person. 
The Mac Address Book lets you search through stored contacts and print 
them as mailing labels or lists, which is impossible to do with a paper 
address book. Therefore, the next time you need to store contacts and con­
tact information, you’ll find it much easier to store this data in the Address 
Book on your Mac. 
Setting Up Address Book
The Address Book acts like a giant Rolodex file that can hold contact cards 
and contact information including e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, 
and postal addresses in separate windows referred to as contact cards. 
When you save information about a person on a card, you can find that 
information again.

656
Setting Up Address Book
Designing a template
Each time you add a contact, the Address Book displays blank fields, with 
each field representing information to fill in about that person, such as 
company, first and last name, title, and e-mail address. You might not want 
or need to store all that information about everyone, so you can define the 
Address Book template to list only the fields you want to use, such as name 
and e-mail address. To modify the Address Book template, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Click the Address Book icon in the Dock (or double-click the Address 
Book icon inside the Applications folder).
	
2.	 Choose Address Book➪Preferences.
	
	 A Preferences window appears.
	
3.	 Click the Template icon.
	
	 The Template pane appears, as shown in Figure 1-1.
	
Figure 1-1: 
The 
Template 
pane shows 
all the fields 
that you can 
store.
	
	
4.	 Remove a field you don’t want by clicking the minus sign to the left of 
the field and then repeating this for every field you want to remove.
	
5.	 Click the Add Field menu and choose a field to add, such as URL or 
Birthday (see Figure 1-2), repeating this for each field you want to add.
	
6.	 (Optional) Click the Phone icon to make the Phone pane appear, as 
shown in Figure 1-3.

The template defines only the fields you know you want to use for storing 
contacts you’ll save in the Address Book. You can always add fields to indi­
vidual cards later. I show you how in the “Editing a card” section, later in 
this chapter.
Storing contacts
After you define a template for your Address Book, the next step is to store 
actual contact names and information, such as phone numbers and e-mail 
addresses, by creating contact cards, referred to as contacts.
	
I explain how to import existing contacts you might already have saved as a 
file or as contact cards near the end of the chapter, in the section “Importing 
data into your Address Book.”
To add a new contact, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪New Card.
	
	 The Address Book window displays a blank card for you to fill in by 
clicking the fields that appear in this contact edit view, as shown in 
Figure 1-4.
	
Figure 1-4:

new contact 
means filling 
out a blank 
card.
	
	
2.	 Click the text fields, such as First, Last, or Telephone Number, and 
then type the information you want to save for your contact.
	
	 You don’t need to fill every field.

3.	 Click the Edit button at the bottom of the Address Book window (or 
press Ô+S) to save your new card and return to the Address Book con­
tact card view.
Displaying companies and people
You have two ways to display your contact cards: by a person’s name or 
by company name. To help you differentiate between company and people 
names, the Address Book displays different icons to the left of each contact 
card, as shown in Figure 1-5.
	
Figure 1-5: 
Icons

companies 
and people.
	
My Card icon

One special contact card, identified by the My Card icon, always represents 
your own contact card and any information it contains, such as your e-mail 
address, phone number, and picture. To define a different card to represent 
you, click that card and choose Card➪Make This My Card. To view your 
card at any time, choose Card➪Go to My Card.
When you create a new contact card, the Address Book assumes that you 
want to display that card by a person’s name. To make a card appear in 
the Address Book by company name instead, click the card and choose 

660
Setting Up Address Book
Card➪Mark as a Company (or check the Company check box when you’re 
creating a new contact card; refer to Figure 1-4). Your chosen card now dis­
plays a company name and icon. To change a company back into a person’s 
name, choose Card➪Mark as a Person.
Editing a card
Information on cards will need to change whenever people change their 
address or company. To keep this information up-to-date, you can edit a 
card by following these steps:
	
1.	 Click All Contacts under the Group category in the Address Book 
window and then click the card you want to edit.
	
	 You might need to scroll down if you have a long list of stored names.
	
2.	 Click the Edit button at the bottom of the Address Book window. 
	
3.	 Click the field in which you want to type or edit information, such as 
an e-mail address or phone number. 
	
4.	 (Optional) Choose Card➪Add Field to choose a field to add on a card, 
as shown in Figure 1-6.
	
	 After you add a field to a card, you need to type information into that 
field.
	
5.	 Click the Edit button again.
	
	 Address Book saves your updated contact information.

Adding pictures to a name
To help yourself remember certain people or companies, you can include a 
picture, either a photograph of that person or a symbolic image that reminds 
you about that person. To add a picture to a card, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the name for which you want to include a picture.
	
2.	 Choose Card➪Choose Custom Image.
	
	 A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 1-7, allowing you to take a picture 
by using the built-in iSight camera (or optional external webcam), or to 
choose a picture file stored on your hard drive.

4.	 Click Set when you’re happy with your chosen image.
Searching contacts
The more contact cards you store in your Address Book, the harder to find 
a particular contact you want. Rather than scrolling through every contact 
card to locate one you’re looking for, you can search for specific contacts by 
following these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Spotlight text box in the upper-right corner of the Address 
Book window.

662
Creating Groups
	
2.	 Type a word or phrase that you want to find, such as a person’s name 
or company that person works for.
	
	 The Address Book displays a list of contacts that match the text you 
typed.
	
3.	 Click a contact to display all the information about that person or 
company.
Deleting a contact
Periodically, you can browse through your Address Book and prune the 
contact cards of people you don’t need to save any more. To delete a name 
from your Address Book, just click the contact and choose Edit➪Delete 
Card. If you accidentally delete a contact, press Ô+Z or choose Edit➪Undo 
to restore it.
	
If you hold down the Ô key, you can click and choose multiple contacts to 
delete. If you hold down the Shift key, you can click two contact cards and 
select those two contacts and all contacts in between as well.
Creating Groups
To help you find all the contacts you’ve stored, the Address Book program lets 
you organize your list of contacts into groups, such as for your co-workers, 
friends, family members, restaurants, and so on. For greater convenience, you 
can even store the same contact in multiple groups. Although you don’t have 
to use groups, this feature can help you manage your list of important contact 
cards.
Your Address Book initially contains one group: All Contacts. The All 
Contacts group automatically stores all contacts you’ve saved in the 
Address Book. 
	
If your Mac is connected to a local area network, you may see a second 
group: Directories. The directories group contains a list of contacts of every­
one connected to a local area network. If you’re using a Mac at home without 
a local area network, you won’t see the Directories group.
Creating a group
You can create as many groups as you want, but for groups to be useful you 
need to add contacts to that group. To create a new group, choose File➪New 
Group. Replace Group Name with a more descriptive name in the Address 
Book window, and then press Return.

Book VII 
Chapter 1

663
Creating Groups
To add contacts to a group, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click All Contacts in the Group column to see all the contacts stored 
in your Address Book.
	
2.	 Move the cursor over a contact, hold down the mouse button, and 
then drag the cursor over the group name where you want to store 
your contact.
	
	 If you hold down the Ô key, you can click and choose multiple contacts. 
If you hold down the Shift key, you can click two noncontiguous con­
tacts to select those two contacts and all contacts in between as well.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button when the group name appears highlighted. 
	
	 Your chosen contact now appears in your newly created group and in 
the All Contacts group.
Creating a group from a selection of contacts
If you already have a group of contacts selected that you want to organize, 
you can create a new group and store those contacts at the same time. To 
create a new group from a selection of contacts, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click All Contacts in the Group column to see all the names stored in 
your Address Book.
	
2.	 Hold down the Ô key and click each contact you want to store in a 
group.
	
	 You can select a range of contacts by holding down the Shift key and 
clicking two noncontiguous contacts. Doing so selects those two con­
tacts and all contacts in between.
	
3.	 Choose File➪New Group from Selection.
	
4.	 Type a more descriptive contact for your group and then press Return.
	
	 Your group now contains the contacts you selected in Step 2.
Adding contacts automatically with Smart Groups
Adding contacts manually or selecting them for a group is fine, but what if 
you frequently add and delete contacts? Doing all this manually can get old. 
To keep your group’s contacts accurate and up-to-date more easily, you can 
use the Smart Group feature.
With a Smart Group, you define the types of contacts you want to store, such 
as contacts for everyone who works at a certain company. Then the Smart 
Group automatically adds any contacts to the group from your Address Book.

664
Creating Groups
To create a Smart Group, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪New Smart Group.
	
	 A dialog appears, asking for a contact and rule for storing contacts in 
the group, as shown in Figure 1-8. A rule lets you group contacts based 
on certain criteria. For example, you might want to group the contacts of 
all people who work for Apple and live in Texas. 
	
Figure 1-8: 
A dialog 
appears 
for defining 
a contact 
and rule for 
creating 
a Smart 
Group.
	
	
2.	 Click the Smart Group Name text box and type a descriptive name for 
your Smart Group.
	
3.	 Click the first pop-up menu and choose the criteria for including a 
contact in your Smart Group, such as Company or City, as shown in 
Figure 1-9.
	
Figure 1-9: 
The first 
pop-up 
menu

4.	 Click the second pop-up menu and then choose how to use the criteria 
you defined in Step 3, such as Contains or Was Updated After.
	
5.	 Click the text box and then type a word or phrase for your criteria 
to use.
	
	 For example, if you want to create a Smart Group that stores only con­
tacts of people who work at Apple, your entire Smart Group rule might 
look like Company Contains Apple (refer to Figure 1-9).
	
6.	 (Optional) Click the plus sign to the right of the text box to create any 
additional rules.
	
	 If you create any additional rules and then decide you don’t want them, 
you can always remove them by clicking the minus sign that appears 
next to the rule.
	
7.	 Click OK.
Creating a Smart Group from search results
Defining the criteria for automatically storing names into a Smart Group can 
be cumbersome when you aren’t quite sure whether the defined criteria will 
work exactly the way you want. As an alternative, you can use Spotlight to 
search for the types of contacts you want to store and then create a Smart 
Group based on your Spotlight search results. By doing this, you can see 
exactly which types of contacts appear in your Smart Group.
To create a Smart Group from Spotlight search results, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Spotlight text box in the upper-right corner of the Address 
Book window, type the text you want to find, such as the name of a 
company or part of an e-mail address, and then press Return.
	
	 The middle Address Book pane shows the contacts found by the text 
you typed into Spotlight.
	
2.	 Choose File➪New Smart Group from Current Search.
	
	 A Smart Group appears in the Group category, using the text you typed 
as the group name.
Deleting a Group
If you create a group and no longer need it, you can delete it. When you 
delete a group, you delete only the group folder; you do not delete any con­
tact cards stored in that group. To delete a group, click the group and then 
choose Edit➪Delete Group.

Managing Your Address Book Files
Managing Your Address Book Files
Eventually, your Address Book can hold so many important contacts that you 
can’t afford to risk losing this information. One way to preserve your contact 
information is to create an archive file of your Address Book, which you then 
store on a backup device other than your Mac, such as a USB drive or external 
hard drive. Another way is to print your entire Address Book (although this 
isn’t a very green option, is it?). Either way, you always have access to your 
important contact information, even if your Mac’s hard drive is wiped out.
Archiving your Address Book
There’re few things worse than manually retyping all your contacts if you 
lose them in a computer disaster. You can create an archive file of your 
Address Book and then back it up to an external drive or write it to a CD for 
safekeeping. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪Export➪Address Book Archive.
	
	 A Save As dialog opens. 
	
2.	 Keep the default name or type a new name in the Save As text box.
	
3.	 Select the location for storing your file; this can be an external drive 
or another folder on your Mac that you regularly back up to an 
external backup device.
	
4.	 Click Save. 
	
For more details on backing up files, see Book II, Chapter 2.
Printing your Address Book
Besides printing a backup copy of your contacts, Address Book lets you 
print all or some of your contact information in different formats, such as 
mailing labels or cards that you can carry with you. To print your Address 
Book, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Use one of the following methods to select the names you want to print:
 
• Click a single contact card.
 
• Hold down the Ô key and click multiple contacts.
 
• Hold down the Shift key, click a contact, and then click another con­
tact elsewhere in the list. Selecting these two contacts highlights 
them both and all contacts in between.
 
• To print all contact cards stored in a group, click the group name, 
and then choose Edit➪Select All or press Ô+A.
 
• Use Spotlight to find names that meet a certain criteria.

printer.
 
• Lists: Prints your Address Book as a long list.
 
• Pocket Address Book: Prints your Address Book in a condensed form 
suitable for carrying with you.
	
	 Depending on the style that you choose in this step, you might need to 
pick additional options, such as defining the specific size of your mailing 
labels or choosing whether to print names in alphabetical order. You 
can also adjust other setting and options, such as number of copies and 
the font you want to use for your printed output.
	
6.	 Click Print.

668
Managing Your Address Book Files
Exporting your Address Book
Sometimes you might need to share your contact information with others. 
To save one or more names from your Address Book into a file that other 
programs and people can use, you export your data to a vCard or archive 
format. A vCard is a standard format that many programs use to store con­
tact information. By storing your data as a vCard, you can copy information 
to another program and computer, such as a Windows PC running Outlook. 
If you need to share contact information with another Mac user, you can 
save your Address Book data as an archive file (as detailed in the earlier 
“Archiving your Address Book” section), or as a vCard file.
To export contacts from your Address Book, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 Select the names you want to export.
	
2.	 Choose File➪Export.
	
	 A submenu appears.
	
3.	 Choose Export vCard or Address Book Archive.
	
	 A Save As dialog appears.
	
4.	 Type a descriptive name for your file in the Save As text box.
	
5.	 Choose the location to store your file.
	
6.	 Click Save.
	
When exporting contacts for use in another program, the program you’re 
importing might not recognize every detail for the contact, such as a per­
son’s picture or notes you’ve added to a person’s contact card.
Importing data into your Address Book
You might already have your contacts in another program, or other people 
might have contact information that you want. Before you can import this 
information, you must export and save the data in one of four file formats:
	
✦	 vCards: Standard file format that is used to store contact information; 
used by programs on different types of computers.
	
✦	 LDIF: Standard data interchange file format; stands for LDAP Data 
Interchange Format.
	
✦	 Text File: Tab-delimited or Comma-Separated Value (CSV) format; 
comes from database or spreadsheet programs, or contact programs.
	
✦	 Address Book Archive: Standard Address Book file format useful for 
transferring data between Macs with Address Book.

To import a contact’s data file into your Address Book, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 Choose File➪Import. 
	
	 A dialog appears.
	
2.	 Select the file you want to import and then click Open. Leave Text 
Encoding on Automatic.
	
	 The Address Book displays your newly imported names.
	
3.	 (Optional) If you’re importing a text or CSV file, make sure the cor­
rect field labels are associated with the data being imported. You can 
change the field labels if necessary.
	
In programs that use the vCard format, such as Outlook and Entourage, you 
can export the contents to a vCard file and then e-mail the file to you. Save 
the attached vCard file and then double-click it to import the contact into 
Address Book automatically without having to bother with the steps above.
Your newly imported contacts will appear in both the All Contacts group 
and the Last Import group in the Group column.
Syncing with other devices 
You can synchronize your Address Book contacts with your iPhone or iPod 
when you connect it to your Mac and open iTunes. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Connect your iPhone or iPod to your Mac with a USB cable.
	
2.	 Click your iPhone or iPod in the Devices column, click the Info tab, 
and then choose Sync Address Book Contacts.
	
	 Your Address Book contacts transfer or update automatically on your 
iPhone or iPod.
If you have a MobileMe account, your Address Book contacts (and iCal 
events and other information) can stay up to date automatically between 
your Mac and one or more other Macs and/or Windows PCs, and your 
iPhone.

✓	Using calendars
✓	Creating and storing events
✓	Finding events
✓	Storing To-Do Lists
✓	Subscribing to calendars
✓	Printing, saving, and exporting calendars
T
he iCal program lets you track appointments you need to attend and 
tasks that you want to complete. To help juggle your appointments, 
such as personal and business appointments, you can create separate calen­
dars so that you can see which days you’re busy with work and which days 
you’re busy with your personal schedule. 
Calendars can be a powerful tool to organize your schedule, track your time, 
and help you plan your goals. The more efficiently you can use your time, 
the more you can accomplish and the faster you can reach your goals.
Understanding iCal 
The iCal window displays the following items, as shown in Figure 2-1:
	
✦	 Calendar List: Displays all calendars that contain related appointments, 
such as home or work-related events.
	
✦	 Mini-Month: Displays the dates for an entire month so you can see 
which day a specific date falls on, such as Tuesday or Saturday.
	
✦	 Events: Shows events scheduled in Day, Week, or Month views. 
	
✦	 To Do List: Displays tasks that you need to accomplish.

Mini-Month
	
Any scheduled activity, such as a doctor’s appointment, a business meeting, 
or your daughter’s soccer practice, is an event. 
Working with the Calendar List
The iCal program initially includes a Home and Work calendar, but you can 
always create or rename additional calendars. You might want an additional 
calendar for a specific work or home-related project, or you might need a 
separate calendar to keep track of your children’s scheduled activities. 
The Calendar List displays the calendars you’ve created, as well as the Home 
and Work calendars provided by iCal. The Calendar List has two uses:
	
✦	 To select a calendar to view (which appears in the middle pane of the 
iCal window)
	
✦	 To hide or display events stored on a particular calendar
When you want to store an event, you must first choose which calendar to 
use. The main reason to have separate calendars is to organize your events 

Book VII
Chapter 2
Staying on Schedule

Working with the Calendar List
into calendar types. For example, the Home calendar is for storing personal 
events, and the Work calendar is for storing business-related events.
By selecting or deselecting the check box next to each calendar in the 
Calendar List, you can selectively view specific events, such as only business 
events. Or, you can view business and personal events together.
The following sections explain managing your calendars in iCal.
Creating a new calendar
Although iCal provides a Home and Work calendar, you might need to create 
additional calendars for other purposes. To create a new calendar, follow 
these steps:

Working with the Calendar List
Creating a new calendar group
Rather than create a bunch of separate calendars, you might want to orga­
nize multiple calendars in a group. For example, if you had a calendar to 
schedule events for your son and daughter, you could put both of those cal­
endars into a Family group. 
Grouping helps you to see the relationships between calendars, and it lets 
you hide grouped calendars to avoid cluttering the Calendar List. When you 
hide a calendar group, you hide all calendars stored within that group.
	
A calendar group can’t store events; it simply stores one or more calendars.
To create a calendar group, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the iCal icon in the Dock (or double-click the iCal icon in the 
Applications folder).
	
2.	 Choose File➪New Calendar Group, or Control-click the Calendar List 
and choose New Group from the pop-up menu.
	
	 A calendar group appears in the Calendar List with a triangle to its left, 
which you click to hide or show any grouped calendars.
	
3.	 Type a descriptive name for your group and press Return.
Adding a new calendar to a group
After you create a group, you can add new calendars to the group by follow­
ing these steps:
	
1.	 In the Calendar List, click the group name to which you want to add a 
new calendar.
	
2.	 Choose File➪New Calendar.
	
	 A new calendar appears indented under the group.
	
3.	 Type a descriptive name for your new calendar and then press 
Return.
Moving an existing calendar to a group
If you have an existing calendar that you want to move into a group, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Move the cursor over a calendar in the Calendar List that you want to 
move into a group.
	
2.	 Hold down the mouse button, drag the mouse to the group you want 
to place the calendar in, and then release the mouse button.
	
	 Your existing calendar now appears indented under the group.

Moving a calendar out of a group
In case you don’t want a calendar in a group, you can move it out of a group 
by following these steps:
	
1.	 Move the cursor over a calendar in the Calendar List that appears 
indented under a group.
	
2.	 Hold down the mouse button, drag the mouse to the CALENDARS title, 
and then release the mouse button.
	
	 Your existing calendar now appears outside any groups.
Moving a calendar or group
To help organize your calendars and groups, you might want to rearrange 
their order in the Calendar List by following these steps:
	
1.	 Move the cursor to the calendar or group you want to move.
	
2.	 Hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse up or down. 
	
	 A thick horizontal line appears where your calendar or group will appear 
in the Calendar List, as shown in Figure 2-3.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new location of 
your calendar or group.

Using the Mini-Month
Renaming and deleting calendars and groups
At any time, you can rename a calendar or group. The name of a calendar or 
group is for your benefit and has no effect on the way iCal works. To rename 
a calendar or group, double-click a calendar or group name, which highlights 
that name. Type a new name and press Return.
If you find that you no longer need a particular calendar or group, click the 
one you want to delete and choose Edit➪Delete. If you have any events 
stored on a calendar, a dialog appears, asking whether you really want to 
delete that calendar or group. Click Delete. If you delete a calendar or group 
by mistake, choose Edit➪Undo or press Ô+Z.
	
When you delete a calendar, you also delete any events stored on that calen­
dar. When you delete a group, you delete all calendars stored in that group 
along with all events stored on those calendars. Make sure you really want 
to delete a calendar or group of calendars. 
Using the Mini-Month
The Mini-Month is a miniature view of the current month that lets you see 
which days fall on specific dates. You can also use the Mini-Month display to 
switch to a different day or week within the Day or Week view displayed in 
the center pane of the iCal window. You can hide or show the Mini-Month by 
choosing View➪Show/Hide Mini Months or by clicking the View/Hide Mini-
Month icon in the bottom-left corner of the iCal window.
Creating and Modifying Events
An event is any occurrence that has a specific time and date associated with 
it. Some common types of events are meetings, appointments with clients, 
times when you need to pick someone up (such as at the airport), or recre­
ational time, such as a two-week vacation. If you know a particular event will 
occur on a specific day and time, you can store that event in an iCal calendar 
so that you won’t forget or schedule something else in that time.
Viewing events
iCal lets you display time frames by day, week, or month, and shows all the 
events you’ve scheduled for the day, week, or month you choose to view. 
To change the time frame of your displayed events, click the Day, Week, or 
Month button at the top of the iCal window. Figure 2-4 shows the day and 
week views (refer to Figure 2-1 for the month view).

4.	 Type a description of your event and press Return.
	
	 In the Day or Week view, iCal automatically sets your event for one hour. 
You can define the start and end time of an event by moving the mouse 
cursor to the top or bottom of an event until it turns into a two-way 
pointing arrow. Hold down the mouse button and move it up or down to 
define your start and end times in 15-minute increments.

5. 	To create a new event in the Month view — which is the view I prefer 
to work in — double-click a day, and the Edit Event box appears, as 
shown in Figure 2-6.
	
	 In this box, you can define the details of your event, such as establishing 
the starting and ending dates and times, and also writing a location or 
setting the event to Repeat. Repeating events are handy to remind you 
of such events as weekly swimming lessons, monthly pet meds, or an 
anniversary. I explain details for each function of the Edit Event box in 
the next section.
	
Figure 2-6: 
The Edit 
Event box 
lets you 
define the 
details for 
your event.
	
	
6.	 When you finish defining your event, click Done.
Editing an event
Sometimes you don’t have all the details of an event when you create it, or 
the details change. Editing an event lets you change the time, the date, or 
the description of an event. You can also add features to an event, such as 
setting an alarm or automatically opening a file. 
Changing the description of an event
Each time you create an event, you type in a description of that event. To 
modify this description, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the event you want to modify and then choose Edit➪Edit Event 
or press Ô+E.
	
2.	 Click the event description (in Figure 2-6, this is Summer Vacation).
	
	 A text box appears around the event description.

4.	 Use the arrow and Delete keys to edit the event description and type 
any new text. Click Done when you finish.
	
	 Click the Location field to type a location where the event takes place.
Creating a recurring event
For an event that occurs regularly, such as every Monday or every month, 
you can create an event one time and tell iCal to display that event on a 
recurring basis. To create a recurring event, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Create a New Event and open the Edit Event dialog; or click an exist­
ing event and then choose Edit➪Edit Event.
	
	 An Edit Event dialog appears (refer to Figure 2-6).
	
2.	 Click the Repeat pop-up menu and choose an option, such as Every 
Day or Every Month.
	
3.	 (Optional) In the Repeat pop-up menu, click Custom.
	
	 A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-7, letting you define specific days 
for the recurring event, such as every Monday and Thursday or the first 
Wednesday of every month. Click OK when you finish creating your 
custom recurring event. 
	
Figure 2-7: 
The Custom 
option lets 
you define 
parameters

	 iCal automatically displays your recurring event throughout the rest of 
the calendar until you modify the event.

Creating and Modifying Events
Setting an alarm for an event
Scheduling an event is useless if you forget about it. That’s why iCal gives 
you the option of setting an alarm that can notify you of upcoming events. 
To set an alarm, you need to decide how you want the alarm to notify you, 
such as displaying a message on the screen.
To set an alarm for an event, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click an event you want reminded about and then choose Edit➪Edit 
Event or press Ô+E.
	
	 An Edit dialog appears (refer to Figure 2-6).
	
2.	 Click the Alarm pop-up menu.
	
	 You can choose the following options:
 
• None: Removes any alarms you’ve already set for the event.
 
• Message: Displays a message on the screen to alert you of an event.
 
• Message with Sound: Displays a message on the screen and plays a 
sound to alert you of an event.
 
• Email: Sends an e-mail message to you.
 
• Open File: Loads and displays a file, such as a report that you can 
review for an upcoming meeting.
 
• Run Script: Runs an AppleScript file that can control your Mac.
	
3.	 Click the time pop-up menu to define when you want the alarm to 
trigger, such as 15 minutes or 1 hour before the event.
	
4.	 (Optional) Depending on the alarm type you choose, other pop-up 
menus might appear and let you choose how to use your alarm. Adjust 
the settings as desired.
	
	 You can add an additional alarm (or many additional alarms) to an event 
by clicking the Alarm pop-up menu that automatically appears beneath a 
new or existing alarm.
	
5.	 Click Done.
Moving an event to another calendar
You can always move an event from one calendar to another, such as from 
your Work calendar to your Home calendar. To move an event to another 
calendar, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click an event that you want to modify and then Choose Edit➪Edit 
Event or press Ô+E.

682
Creating and Modifying Events
	
2.	 Click the Calendar pop-up menu and then choose the calendar name 
you want the event to appear in.
	
3.	 Click Done.
Adding information to an event
To prepare for an event, you can also store information about that event’s 
location, attendees, any important files related to the event (such as a pre­
sentation), a Web site URL, and any additional notes you want to jot down.
To add information to an event, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click an event that you want to modify and then Choose Edit➪Edit 
Event or press Ô+E.
	
2.	 Choose one or more of the following:
 
• Location: Remind yourself where the event will take place.
 
• Attendees: Type the names of people associated with an event.
 
• Attachments: Attach a file to an event, such as a business presenta­
tion that you need to give at the event.
 
• URL: Type a Web site address that’s relevant to your event, such as 
the restaurant’s Web site for an upcoming dinner.
 
• Note: Type any additional notes about your event.
	
3.	 Click Done.
Moving an event
In case you store an event at the wrong date or time, you can change the 
date and time in the Edit Event dialog, or move it to a new date and time by 
following these steps:
	
1.	 Move the cursor to the middle of the event box.
	
2.	 Hold down the mouse button and drag the cursor to a new time or date.
	
	 The event moves with the cursor; the duration doesn’t change.
	
3.	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new date and 
time of the event.
Duplicating an event
If a particular event occurs more than one time, you could type the event 
multiple times, but why spend all that effort? Instead, you can create an 
event, duplicate it, and then move the duplicate to another date. To dupli­
cate an event, just click it and choose Edit➪Duplicate or press Ô+D (or hold 

Book VII 
Chapter 2
Staying on Schedule 
with iCal
683
Finding Events
down the Option key and then drag the event to the new time slot). When 
the duplicate appears, move the cursor to it, drag the event to a new date, 
and then release the mouse button.
	
If your event occurs at a regular interval — for example, once a month or 
every Tuesday and Thursday — you can make your event a recurring event 
in the Repeat pop-up menu of the Edit Event dialog. 
Deleting an event
When you no longer need to remember an event, you can delete it. Just click 
it and choose Edit➪Delete. If you delete an event by mistake, press Ô+Z or 
choose Edit➪Undo to retrieve your event.
Finding Events
Storing events is only useful if you can view upcoming events so you can 
prepare for them. To help you find and view events, iCal offers several dif­
ferent methods that include using colors to identify different types of events 
and letting you search for a specific event by name.
Color-coding events
To help identify which events belong to which calendars, you can assign a 
color to every calendar in your Calendar List. So if you assign the color blue 
to your Home calendar and the color red to your Work calendar, you can 
quickly identify which events on your calendar are home-related (blue) or 
work-related (red).
To assign a color to a calendar, click a calendar in the Calendar List and 
choose Edit➪Get Info or press Ô+I. In the Info dialog that appears (see 
Figure 2-8), click the color pop-up menu, choose a color, and then click OK. 
Events stored on that calendar now appear in the color you chose.
	
Use contrasting colors for multiple calendars to make it easy to tell which 
events belong to which calendar. 
Selectively hiding events
Normally, iCal displays all events, color-coding them so that you can tell 
which events belong to which calendars. However, if you have too many 
events, you might find that mixing Home and Work events can seem too con­
fusing. If you want to see only events stored on a specific calendar (such as 
Home or Work calendars), you can hide events stored on other calendars.

684
Finding Events
	
Figure 2-8: 
The Info 
dialog lets 
you edit a 
calendar’s 
name and

To hide events stored on other calendars, deselect the check box of any of 
those calendars in the Calendar List. To view events stored on a calendar, 
make sure a check mark appears in the check box of that calendar, as shown 
in Figure 2-9.

Finding Events
Checking for today’s events
Probably the most important events you need to worry about are the ones 
you’ve scheduled for today. To see all events scheduled for today, click the 
Day or Week button at the top of the iCal window and then choose View➪Go 
to Today. 
	
Another quick way to review any upcoming events for today is to use the 
Calendar widget in Dashboard. To display today’s events in the Calendar 
widget, click the current date (which appears in the left pane) of the 
Calendar widget until the events pane appears. (For more information about 
Dashboard, see Book II, Chapter 1.)
Checking events for a specific date
Sometimes you might need to know whether you have any events scheduled 
on a certain date. To check a specific date, click the Day or Week button at 
the top of the iCal window and then choose View➪Go to Date.
	
The Month view can show you the events scheduled for a particular date, 
but the Day and Week views can show you the specific times of your events 
for that day.
Searching for an event
If you scheduled an event several days ago, you might forget the exact date 
of that event. To help you find a specific event, iCal lets you search for it by 
typing all or part of the information stored in that event, such as the event 
name, the attendee names, or any notes you stored about the event. 
To search for an event, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Spotlight text box in the upper-right corner of the iCal 
window.
	
2.	 Type as much text as you can remember about the event you want to 
find, such as an attendee’s name or the location of the event.
	
	 The iCal program displays a list of events that match the text you type. 
The list appears below the calendar, as shown in Figure 2-10.
	
3.	 Double-click an event that Spotlight found.
	
	 Your chosen event appears.

Making a To-Do List
	
4.	 Click the Clear button in the Spotlight text box to remove the list 
of matching events from the bottom of the iCal window (or choose

Making a To-Do List
A To-Do List typically contains goals or reminders of important tasks that 
you want to accomplish usually by a specific date or time. By reviewing your 
To-Do List every day, you can stay focused on achieving the goals that are 
most important to you so that you don’t waste time accomplishing tasks that 
won’t get you any closer to your goals.
Viewing and hiding the To-Do List
You can view your To-Do List and then hide it to make more room for view­
ing your events. To show the To-Do List, choose View➪Show To Do List. The 
To-Do List appears on the right side of the iCal window.

Book VII 
Chapter 2
Staying on Schedule

687
Making a To-Do List
To hide the To-Do List from view, choose View➪Hide To Do List. This tucks 
the To-Do List out of sight once more. By default, iCal hides the To-Do List.
	
Another way to hide or display the To-Do List is to click the pushpin icon at 
the bottom-right corner of the iCal window.
Adding tasks to the To-Do List
When you add a task to your To-Do List, you must assign it to a calendar so 
that it appears color coded, like an event. By color-coding your To Do tasks, 
you can identify which tasks might be work-related and which might be 
related to any other calendars you’ve created.
To add a task to the To-Do List, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose View➪Show To Do List. (Skip this step if the To-Do List is 
already visible.)
	
2.	 Click a calendar that you want to assign a task to, such as the Work or 
Home calendar. 
	
3.	 Double-click any blank space in the To-Do List.
	
	 A blank To-Do task appears, color-coded to match the calendar you 
chose in Step 2.
	
4.	 Type a description of your task and press Return.
	
	 Your chosen task appears in the To-Do List.
Setting due dates for your To-Do List tasks
It’s a good idea to place due dates on your To-Do List tasks so that you have 
a deadline, which can spur you into taking action to achieve your goal. 
To assign a due date to a To-Do task, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click a task in the To-Do List or click a task in the To-Do List 
and Choose Edit➪Edit To Do.
	
	 An Edit dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-11.
	
2.	 Select the Due Date check box. 
	
	 When you select the Due Date check box, a date appears so that you can 
type a month, day, and year for the due date.
	
3.	 Click Close.

Prioritizing your To-Do List
Not all tasks are equally important. To prioritize your tasks, click the Prioritize 
button that appears to the right of a task in the To-Do List. A pop-up menu 
appears, from which you can choose None, Low, Medium, or High, as shown in 
Figure 2-12. Click the To Do pop-up menu (the gray button at the top of the To 
Do window that contains the text “To Do Items by Priority”) and then choose 
Sort by Priority. This option puts your High priority tasks at the top of your 
To-Do List.
	
Figure 2-12: 
If you sort 
tasks by 
priority, you 
can see 
the most 
important 
tasks on

List.
	
Completing, editing, and deleting To-Do tasks
Completing tasks can give you a sense of accomplishment. Rather than delete 
a completed task, you can mark it completed. To mark a task completed, 
select the check box that appears to the left of a task in the To-Do List.
After you create a task, you can always edit it later to correct any misspell­
ings or make any modifications. To edit a To Do task, follow these steps:

3.	 Click Done.
When you finish a task, you’ll eventually want to delete it to avoid cluttering 
your To-Do List. To delete a task, click the task and choose Edit➪Delete. If 
you accidentally delete a task, you can retrieve it by pressing Ô+Z or choos­
ing Edit➪Undo.
Subscribing to Online Calendars
The iCal program allows you to subscribe to online calendars, such as a 
calendar of holidays, or a calendar of new DVD releases. Calendars you sub­
scribe to appear under the Subscriptions category in the Calendars column. 
Events that appear in these calendars are added, deleted, and modified by 
the person or organization that maintains the online calendar.
You can also add calendar accounts, typically known as CalDAV or Exchange 
accounts, which can display one or more calendars you use at your work­
place or a calendar you created and use with your Google or Yahoo! e-mail 
account. Events that you create or change at work using your company’s cal­
endar program, or events you create or change using your Google or Yahoo! 
account, are automatically added to your iCal calendar, and vice versa.
To subscribe to an online calendar:
	
✦	 Choose Calendar➪Subscribe to open the URL dialog, type the Internet 
URL for the calendar you want to subscribe to, such as the URL for a 
U.S. holidays online calendar (shown in Figure 2-13), and then click 
Subscribe. The name of your new online calendar appears in the 
Calendars column, and the online calendar’s events appear in your iCal 
calendar window.
	
✦	 Choose iCal➪Preferences to open the iCal Preferences window, click the 
Accounts tab, and then add an online calendar account, as I describe in 
the next section.

Account Type pop-up menu (refer to Figure 2-15), choose CalDAV, 
Exchange 2007, Google, or Yahoo!, fill the necessary fields, and then 
click Create.
Managing iCal Files
The iCal program stores files in a special file format called iCalendar (which 
uses the .ics file extension). Because the iCalendar file format is a standard 
for storing calendar information, you can share your calendar files with any 
program that recognizes the iCalendar format, including Microsoft Outlook. 
Exporting iCal data
To share your calendars with other programs (even those running on other 
operating systems, such as Windows or Linux), you need to export your iCal 
file by following these steps:

692
Managing iCal Files
	
1.	 Choose File➪Export.
	
	 A dialog appears, giving you a chance to choose a filename and location 
to store your iCal data, as shown in Figure 2-16.
	
Figure 2-16: 
To export 
your 
calendars, 
you need 
to specify 
a name 
for your 
exported 
file and a 
location to 
store it.
	
	
2.	 Click the Save As text box and type a name for your file.
	
3.	 Choose the location to store your file from the Where pop-up menu. 
	
4.	 Click Export.
Importing iCal data
If you store calendar information in another program, you can export that 
data as an iCal file or a vCal file, and then import that file into iCal. If you’re 
using Microsoft Entourage, you can save your Entourage calendar informa­
tion as a separate file.
After you save calendar data from another program, you can import that file 
into iCal by following these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪Import and choose Import or Import from Entourage.
	
	 If you choose Import from Entourage, iCal scans your Mac’s hard drive 
for your existing Entourage calendar data and imports those calendar 
events into iCal, and you can skip the remaining steps.
	
2.	 Click the drive and/or folder that contains the file you want to import.
	
3.	 Click the file you want to import and then click Import.
	
	 iCal imports your chosen calendar file’s data into iCal.

Managing iCal Files
Backing up iCal data and restoring a backup file
Because iCal can store all your upcoming events (appointments, meetings, 
and so on), disaster could strike if your hard drive fails and wipes out your 
iCal data. For that reason, you should always keep a backup copy of your 
iCal data. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪Export➪iCal Archive.
	
	 The Save dialog appears.
	
2.	 Click the Save As text box and type a descriptive name for your iCal 
backup file.
	
3.	 Choose the location for storing your file from the Where pop-up menu.
	
4.	 Click Save.
	
It’s a good idea to save your iCal backup file on a separate drive, such as an 
external hard drive. That way if your Mac hard drive fails, you won’t lose 
both your original iCal data and your backup file at the same time. For more 
details on backing up files, see Book II, Chapter 2.
To retrieve your schedule from a backup file that you created earlier, choose 
File➪Import➪Import. In the Open dialog that appears, click the drive and 
folder where you saved your backup iCal file. Then click Import. iCal imports 
the backed-up file; any changes you made since the last backup will be lost.
Printing an iCal file
Even if you have a laptop, you can’t always have your computer with you, so 
you might want to print your calendar in the Day, Week, or Month view. To 
print a calendar, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose File➪Print.
	
	 A Print dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-17.
	
2.	 Click the View pop-up menu and choose Day, Week, or Month.
	
3.	 (Optional) Change any other settings, such as the paper size or time 
range that you want to view.
	
4.	 Click Continue.
	
	 Another Print dialog appears.
	
5.	 Click the Printer pop-up menu, choose a printer, and then click Print.

Syncing with other devices 
You can synchronize your iCal calendars with your iPhone or iPod when you 
connect it to your Mac and open iTunes. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Connect your iPhone or iPod to your Mac with a USB cable.
	
2.	 Click the Info tab and then choose Sync iCal Calendars.
	
3.	 Choose to synchronize all your calendars or just selected ones. 
	
4.	 Click Apply.
	
	 Your iCal calendars transfer or update automatically on your iPhone or 
iPod.
If you have a MobileMe account, you can keep your iPhone, Mac, and even 
Windows computers all synchronized automatically.

Chapter 3: Running Windows 
on a Mac
In This Chapter
✓	Understanding why you might need Windows
✓	Giving your Mac a split personality with Boot Camp
✓	Running virtual machines
✓	Using CrossOver Mac
A
s much as you might enjoy using your Mac, sometimes you might need 
to run Windows because you need to use a program that runs only on 
Windows. Many programs are Windows-only, such as a number of astrol­
ogy or stock picking programs, as are many custom applications developed 
by a company for in-house use. When faced with this dilemma, you have a 
choice:
	
✦	 You can buy a Windows PC and use that computer just to run the 
Windows program you need. 
	
✦	 You can run Windows on your Mac. Ever since Apple started using Intel 
processors, you’ve been able to turn your Mac into a Windows PC. 
Don’t worry — you don’t have to wipe out your hard drive and eliminate 
the Mac OS to run Windows. You have ways to run Windows on your Mac 
that still let you use all the features that made you want to use a Mac in the 
first place.
	
If you need Windows to access Microsoft Exchange services like address 
lists, calendar events, and e-mail, Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard gives you 
access to this information through Mail, iCal, and Address Book. Therefore, 
you might not need to install Windows after all.
Giving Your Mac a Split Personality with Boot Camp
To install Windows on a Mac, you can split your hard drive in two parts (
the parts are partitions) and use one partition to install and run Windows 
and a second to keep using Mac OS X the way you’ve been using it. By stor­
ing two different operating systems on your hard drive, you can choose 

696
Giving Your Mac a Split Personality with Boot Camp
which operating system to use every time you turn on your computer. To 
divide your hard drive into partitions and install Windows, Apple provides a 
program called Boot Camp. 
To use Boot Camp, you need the following:
	
✦	 A Mac with an Intel processor
	
✦	 Version 10.5 or later of the Mac OS X operating system
	
✦	 (Optional) A printer for printing instructions for installing Boot Camp
	
✦	 At least 10GB free space on your Mac’s hard drive
	
✦	 An optical disc drive, either internal or external
	
✦	 The latest firmware updates
	
	 Firmware is software stored on your Mac’s internal processor. Firmware 
tells your Mac how to turn itself on and work with all of its hardware com­
ponents. If Apple has released new firmware for your Mac, you can find 
and retrieve it by clicking the Apple menu and choosing Software Update.
	
✦	 A Mac OS X version 10.6 installation disc
	
✦	 A legitimate copy of Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or any version 
of Vista (Basic, Home Premium, Business, or Ultimate editions) or 
Windows 7
	
	 You must use a full, 32-bit version of Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7 
that comes on a single CD or DVD. You can use a 64-bit version of Windows 
Vista or Windows XP Pro if your Mac Pro or MacBook Pro was built in 
2008 or later.
Follow these basic steps to use Boot Camp:
	
1.	 Make sure your Mac can run Boot Camp.
	
2.	 Create a partition on your hard drive and install Windows.
The following sections give the details you need to complete these steps.
Making sure you can run Boot Camp
If you have a new Mac, chances are very good that you can run Boot 
Camp. However, the older your Mac is, the lower your chances of using 
this program. 
Identifying the hardware capabilities of your Mac
To identify the processor, firmware version, and version number of the Mac 
OS X operating system running on your computer, follow these steps:

Book VII
Chapter 3
Running Windows 
on a Mac
697
Giving Your Mac a Split Personality with Boot Camp
	
1.	 Click the Apple menu and choose About This Mac.
	
	 An About This Mac window, shown in Figure 3-1, appears.
	
Figure 3-1: 
The About 
This Mac 
window 
identifies 
the 
processor 
type and 
version of 
Mac OS X.
	
	
2.	 Make sure the processor type contains the word Intel, such as Intel 
Core 2 Duo.
	
	 If the processor type contains the term PowerPC, you can’t use Boot 
Camp.
	
3.	 Make sure the version number is 10.5 or higher.
	
	 If the version number is lower, such as 10.3, you can’t use Boot Camp 
until you acquire and install a newer version of Mac OS X.
	
4.	 Click the Close button of the About This Mac window.
Identifying the amount of free space on your hard drive
You need at least 10GB of free space on your hard drive to install both Boot 
Camp and Windows. To find out how much free space you have on your 
hard drive, click the Finder icon in the Dock and, in the Finder window that 
opens, click the Macintosh HD icon in the sidebar. If you look at the status 
bar at the bottom of the Finder window, you can see how much space is 
available on your hard drive.
Installing Windows
When you’re certain your Mac can run Boot Camp, you need to go through 
two more steps before you can install Windows. First, you need to parti­
tion your hard drive. This reserves a chunk of your hard drive for Windows. 
Some good news here: Creating a partition and installing Windows on 

698
Giving Your Mac a Split Personality with Boot Camp
your computer are tasks you have to do only once (unless your hard drive 
crashes and you have to reinstall everything).
Second, you need to install Windows on your newly created hard drive 
partition. Installing Windows can be time-consuming but isn’t necessarily 
difficult. The two most technical parts of installing Windows on a Mac 
involve partitioning your hard drive and choosing that partition to install 
Windows on.
Partitioning divides your hard drive in two parts: one part for Mac OS X and 
the second part for Windows. Boot Camp uses nondestructive partitioning, 
which means you resize your hard drive without losing data. After you parti­
tion your hard drive, you must tell Windows which partition to install on, 
and you must specify the partition designated for Windows. 
	
If you install Windows on the wrong partition, you’ll wipe out everything on 
your Mac. If you don’t feel comfortable partitioning a hard drive and choos­
ing the right partition to install Windows on, get a more knowledgeable 
friend to help you.
	
Before installing Windows, it’s a good idea to run the Disk Utility to verify 
and repair your Mac hard drive and then back up your files. You can read 
about backing up in Book II, Chapter 2 and about verifying a disk in Book II, 
Chapter 5.
To install Windows, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the Finder window by clicking the Finder icon on the Dock. 
	
2.	 Choose Go➪Utilities. 
	
	 The contents of the Utilities folder appear in the right pane.
	
3.	 Double-click the Boot Camp Assistant icon.
	
	 A Boot Camp Assistant window appears, informing you of the process of 
using Boot Camp, as shown in Figure 3-2.
	
4.	 Click the Print Installation & Setup Guide button.
	
	 A Print dialog appears.
	
5.	 Change the default settings, such as changing the paper size, and 
click OK.
	
	 A second Print dialog appears, letting you choose a specific printer and 
number of copies to print.

8.	 Move the pointer over the divider between the Macintosh partition 
and the Windows partition, hold down the mouse button, and then 
drag the mouse left or right to choose a partition size. 
	
	 If you’re installing Windows XP, the minimum partition size should be 
5GB. If you’re installing Vista, the minimum partition size should be 8GB. 
You might want to choose an even larger partition size if you plan to 
install many Windows programs.
	
9.	 Click the Partition button.
	
	 Boot Camp partitions your hard drive. (This process might take a little 
while.) When partitioning is complete, another Boot Camp Assistant 
window appears, asking you to insert your valid Windows installation 
disc in your Mac, as shown in Figure 3-4.
	
Figure 3-4: 
The Boot

Assistant 
window lets 
you know 
when to

10.	 Insert your Windows installation disc in your Macintosh and then 
click the Start Installation button.
	
	 When the Windows installation program asks you which partition to 
install on, look for the partition size you specified in Step 8 that displays 
BOOT CAMP. If you choose the wrong partition, Windows might install 
on your Mac’s partition, which could wreck your files and bring your 
entire Mac crashing to its knees. Refer to your printed Installation & 
Setup Guide for specific XP, Vista, and Windows 7 help.
	
11.	 Follow the Windows installation instructions on the screen, and when 
the installation is finished, eject the disc.
	
	 Be patient. Installing Windows can take time and Windows will reboot 
several times during installation, so don’t panic if the screen suddenly 
goes blank.

12.	 Insert the Mac OS X installation disc.
	
13.	 Follow the onscreen instructions to install the Boot Camp drivers. 
	
	 The Boot Camp drivers allow certain Mac components to work in the 
Windows environment, such as AirPort, the built-in iSight camera, the 
trackpad on a notebook MacBook, and the function keys on the Apple 
keyboard. Also, a Windows control panel installs from the Mac OS X 
installation disc. 
	
	 Click Continue Anyway if you see a message that tells you the software 
you are installing has not passed Windows Logo testing. Do not click 
Cancel in any of the installer dialogs. Follow the instructions for any 
wizards that appear.
Choosing an operating system with Boot Camp
After you use Boot Camp to install Windows on your Mac, you can use Boot 
Camp to choose which operating system to run by following these steps:
	
1.	 Restart your computer and hold down the Option key until two disk 
icons appear.
	
	 One disk icon is labeled Windows and the other is labeled Macintosh 
HD. (If you changed the name of your Mac’s hard disk, you’ll see this 
name displayed instead.)
	
2.	 Double-click the Windows or Macintosh Startup Disk icon.
	
	 Your chosen operating system starts.
	
Holding down the X key after you power your Mac tells your Mac you 
want to load Mac OS X. You can let go of the X key as soon as you see 
the Mac OS X startup screen.
	
To switch to a different operating system, you have to shut down the current 
operating system and repeat the preceding steps to choose the other operat­
ing system.
If you start your Mac without holding down the Option key, your Mac starts 
the default operating system. You can define the default operating system in 
Mac OS X by following these steps: 
	
1.	 Within Mac OS X, click Ú➪System Preferences to open the System 
Preferences window.
	
2.	 Click the Startup Disk icon under the System category.
	
	 The Startup Disk window opens, as shown in Figure 3-5.
	
3.	 Click the Mac OS X or Windows icon and click the Restart button.

The Startup 
Disk 
window lets 
you choose

partition 
to make

startup disk.
	
	
If you click the Target Disk Mode button, you can make your Mac appear 
like an external hard drive when connected to another computer with a 
FireWire cable.
Sharing Mac and Windows files
With Mac OS X version 10.6, whether you’re running the Mac or Windows 
operating system, you can open and view files from the other operating sys­
tem’s hard drive partition. To modify files, copy the file from the partition 
where the file is stored to the operating system partition you’re using. For 
example, if you’re in Windows and want to modify a file saved on your Mac 
partition, copy the file from the Mac partition to the Windows partition, and 
then make the changes. 
Removing Windows from your Mac 
If you want to wipe out the partition on your hard drive that contains 
Windows, you can do so by following these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click the Boot Camp Assistant icon in the Utilities folder.
	
	 An Introduction dialog appears. 
	
2.	 Click the Continue button.
	
	 A Select Task dialog appears. 
	
3.	 Click the Create or Remove a Windows Partition button and then click 
the Continue button.
	
	 A Restore Disk to a Single Volume dialog appears. 
	
	 Wiping out your Windows partition deletes all data stored on that parti­
tion that you created using Windows.
	
4.	 Click the Restore button.

Using Virtual Machines
Using Virtual Machines
Although you can share files between the Mac and Windows partitions as 
described previously in this chapter, you might still want to purchase a 
virtualization program, such as Parallels (www.parallels.com) or Fusion 
(www.vmware.com), to run Windows and Mac OS X at the same time and 
switch between the two. Another virtualization program that you can down­
load and use free is VirtualBox (www.virtualbox.org).
	
Virtualization is a technology that lets you run multiple operating systems 
at the same time where each operating system time-shares the computer’s 
hardware. Because the operating system isn’t really controlling the comput­
er’s hardware completely, the operating system is called a virtual machine 
(as opposed to a real machine). 
Parallels, Fusion, and Virtual Box work in similar ways by creating a single 
file on your Mac hard drive that represents a virtual PC hard drive that con­
tains the actual Windows operating system plus any additional Windows 
programs you might install, such as Microsoft Office. 
When you run Parallels, Fusion, or Virtual Box, the program boots up from 
this virtual hard drive while your original Mac OS X operating system con­
tinues to run. This lets you run another operating system, such as Windows, 
inside a separate Mac OS X window, as shown in Figure 3-6.
	
Figure 3-6: 
A 
virtualization 
program 
lets you run 
Windows

separate 
Mac 
window. 
	

704
Using CrossOver Mac
Instead of forcing you to load Windows and then load a specific program 
within Windows, virtualization programs let you store a Windows program 
icon directly on the Desktop or in the Dock so that it behaves like a Mac 
program icon.
Clicking a Windows program icon loads Windows and the Windows program 
at the same time without showing the Windows desktop or the Windows 
Start menu.
Because the operating system stored on the virtual hard drive has to share 
the computer’s processor and memory with Mac OS X, operating systems 
running on virtual machines tend to run slower than when you run Windows 
and Windows programs within Boot Camp. In Boot Camp, the program has 
total access to your computer’s hardware, meaning the program runs as fast 
as it would on a standalone Windows PC. 
To ease the migration from Windows to the Mac, virtualization programs 
can clone your existing Windows PC and duplicate it, with all your data and 
programs, on to the Mac. You can essentially use your old Windows PC as a 
virtual computer on your Mac. 
Using CrossOver Mac
With Boot Camp, VirtualBox, Parallels, and Fusion, you need to buy a sepa­
rate copy of Windows. CrossOver Mac lets you run Windows programs with­
out a copy of Windows. The program works by fooling Windows programs 
into thinking they’re really running on a Windows PC.
CrossOver Mac lets you pop a Windows CD into your Mac and install the 
Windows program on a simulated PC that CrossOver Mac creates automati­
cally on your Mac. After you install a Windows program, CrossOver Mac dis­
plays the normal Windows icons inside a Finder window. Double-clicking the 
Windows program icon runs that Windows program on your Mac, as shown 
in Figure 3-7.
Like Parallels, Fusion, and Virtual Box, CrossOver Mac runs only on Intel 
Macintosh computers. A more crucial limitation is that CrossOver Mac 
works with only a handful of Windows programs, so you can’t run just 
any Windows program on a Mac with CrossOver Mac and expect it to run 
flawlessly.

To help you determine whether your favorite Windows program will work 
with CrossOver Mac, the product’s Web site (www.codeweavers.com/
compatibility/browse/name) lists all known programs that have been 
tested and verified to work correctly. If you need to run the latest Windows 
programs, a little-known Windows program, or a custom Windows program, 
CrossOver Mac probably won’t let you run it. However, if you need to run 
only a handful of older or popular programs, CrossOver Mac might be the 
ideal solution.

Chapter 1: Networking Your Macs
In This Chapter
✓	Creating a wired network
✓	Creating a wireless network
I
f you have multiple Macs in the same place, you might find it convenient 
to connect your Macs to a network. A network allows multiple comput­
ers to share files and other resources like printers or backup hard drives. 
Although you could copy a file on a USB flash drive, plug it into another 
computer, and copy the files onto the second computer or print using 
the second computer’s printer, such an approach (dubbed sneaker net) is 
tedious and inconvenient. However, when multiple computers connect to a 
network, they can share files almost as quickly and easily as copying a file 
from one folder to another. 
Creating a Wired Network
The simplest wired network just connects two computers together using 
either a FireWire cable or a cable that conforms to a networking cable stan­
dard called Ethernet. Only the MacBook Air and two short-lived MacBook 
models shipped without a FireWire port. Every Mac (except the MacBook 
Air, again) has an Ethernet port, so if you plug a FireWire cable or Ethernet 
cable into the FireWire or Ethernet ports of two Macs, you’ll have a simple 
network, as shown in Figure 1-1.
	
Figure 1-1:

Ethernet or FireWire cable

710
Creating a Wired Network
	
Ethernet cables are often identified by the speeds that they can send data. 
The earliest Ethernet cables were Category 3 (or Cat 3) cables and could 
transfer data at 10 megabits per second (Mbps). The next generation of 
Ethernet cables was Category 5 (Cat 5) cables, which could transfer data at 
100 Mbps. Category 6 (Cat 6) cables transfer data at 1,000 Mbps or one giga­
bit per second (Gbit/s). With networking, speed is everything and Category 
6a (Cat 6a) and Category 7 (Cat 7) transfer data at 10 Gbit/s. Category 7a 
reaches transfer speeds of 100 Gbit/s.
Connecting two computers can be convenient for sharing files, but most 
networks typically consist of multiple computers connected together. Such 
a large network of multiple computers allows different computers to share 
files with each other.
Because it’s physically impossible to connect more than two computers 
together with a single cable, networks typically use something called a hub. 
Each computer connects to the hub, which indirectly connects each com­
puter to every other computer also connected to the hub, as shown in 
Figure 1-2.
An improved variation of a hub is called a switch. Physically, a hub and 
a switch both connect multiple computers in a single point (as shown in 
Figure 1-2).
With a hub, a network acts like one massive hallway that every computer 
shares. If a bunch of computers transfers data at the same time, the shared 
network can get crowded with data flowing everywhere, slowing the transfer 
of data throughout the network.
With a switch, the switch directs data between two computers. As a result, 
a switch can ensure that data transfers quickly regardless of how much data 
the other computers on the network are transferring at the time.
A variation of a switch is a router, which often adds a firewall. Because 
routers cost nearly the same as ordinary hubs and switches, most wired 
networks rely on routers. So if you want to create a wired network of com­
puters, you need
	
✦	 Two or more computers
	
✦	 A network switch or router
	
✦	 Enough cables to connect each computer to the network switch or 
router

The speed of a wired network depends entirely on the slowest speed of the 
components used in your network. If you plan to use Cat 6 cables in your 
network, make sure your network switch is designed for Cat 6 cables. If not, 
you’ll have the fastest Ethernet cables connected to a slow network switch, 
which will run only as fast as the slowest part of your network.
Creating a Wireless Network
Because wired networks can be inflexible, more people set up wireless net­
works instead. Essentially a wireless network is no different from a wired 
network, except (as the name implies) there are no wires. Wireless networks 
are generally a bit slower than wired networks. 

712
Creating a Wireless Network
	
Because of physical obstacles, wireless networks don’t always reach certain 
parts of a room or building, resulting in “dead spots” where you can’t con­
nect wirelessly. Walls or furniture can disrupt the wireless signals.
All you need is a device called an access point, which can plug into your 
existing wired network. This access point broadcasts a signal that other 
computers can receive, creating a wireless connection to the network, as 
shown in Figure 1-3. 
	
Figure 1-3: 
A wireless 
access 
point 
extends 
the reach 
of a wired 
network.
	
Wireless access point
Your router may have wireless capabilities so you can connect the computer 
or printer that stays in one place to the router with an Ethernet cable but 
connect to the wireless network connection on your MacBook to work from 
your lawn chair in the garden, or from a desktop Mac located in another 
room in the house. Some cable and DSL modems come with built-in Wi-Fi 
transmitters, which means one device does the job of two if you choose to 
use a separate Wi-Fi router to connect to your cable or DSL modem.

Book VIII 
Chapter 1
Networking  
Your Macs
713
Creating a Wireless Network
The difference between an access point and a router is the router is at the 
center of the network, allowing the computers to share printers, Internet 
connections, and external hard drives. The access point is what allows the 
computers with wireless capabilities to connect to the network from across 
the room, from another room, or even outside on the porch, providing the 
wireless signal is strong enough to reach wherever you are with your Mac.
	
For more information about wireless networking, pick up a copy of AirPort 
and Mac Wireless Networks For Dummies, by Michael E. Cohen (Wiley).
Not all wireless networks are alike. The earliest wireless networks followed a 
technical specification called 802.11b or 802.11a. Newer wireless equipment 
followed a faster wireless standard called 802.11g, and the latest standard 
(at the time of this writing) is 802.11n.
To access a wired network, someone must 
physically connect a computer to the network 
using a cable. However, connecting to a wire­
less network can be done from another room, 
outside a building, or even across the street. As 
a result, wireless networks can be much less 
secure because a wireless network essen­
tially shoves dozens of virtual cables out the 
window, so anyone can walk by and connect 
into the network.
The practice of connecting to unsecured wire­
less networks with malicious intentions is war 
driving (also war flying, war walking, or war 
boating, depending on how you move around). 
The basic idea behind war driving is to drive 
around a city and keep track of which areas 
offer an unsecured wireless network. After 
getting connected to an unsecured wireless 
network, an intruder can wipe out files, cap­
ture personal information or interfere with the 
network’s operation.
When creating a wireless network, you can 
make your network more secure by taking 
advantage of a variety of security measures 
and options. The simplest security measure is 
to use a password that locks out people who 
don’t know the password. For further protec­
tion, you can also use encryption.
Encryption scrambles the data sent to and 
from the wireless network. Without encryption, 
anyone can intercept information sent through 
a wireless network (including passwords). Still 
another security measure involves configur­
ing your wireless network to let only specific 
computers connect to the wireless network. By 
doing this, an intruder cannot gain access to 
the wireless network because his or her com­
puter is not approved to access the network.
Ultimately, wireless networking requires more 
security measures simply because it offers 
potential intruders the ability to access the 
network without physically being in the same 
room, house, or building. Wireless networks 
can be as safe as wired networks — as long 
as you turn on security options that can make 
your wireless network as secure as possible.

Creating a Wireless Network
When setting up a wireless network, make sure your router and/or wireless 
access point use the same wireless standard as the built-in wireless radio or 
wireless adapter plugged into each of your computers. All new and recent 
Macs connect to Wi-Fi routers that use one or up to all four types of the wire­
less network standards.
You can buy any brand of wireless access point or router to create a net­
work, including Apple’s Airport Extreme Base Station. Any router you 
choose will come with specific software and instructions for setting up your 
network. The basic steps are to
	
1.	 Name your network and base station so computers on the network can 
then find and connect to your Wi-Fi network.
	
2.	 Set up a password. (WPA2 provides the most security.)
	
3.	 Define how you connect to the Internet. (You may need information 
from your Internet Service Provider for this step.)
	
4.	 Add printers and/or external hard drives.
	
After you physically connect your wired network or configure your wireless 
network, you might still need to configure your Mac to work on your net­
work if you want to share files and printers, which is the topic of Book VIII, 
Chapter 2.

Chapter 2: Sharing Files and 
Resources on a Network

B
y sharing over a network, everyone can benefit, and the benefits can 
range from swapping files quickly and easily to sharing a single printer 
instead of having to buy a printer for every computer.
Although networks allow others to share your files, nobody on a network 
can rummage through your Mac without your permission. Ideally, a network 
allows you to share files and equipment without risking the loss or corrup­
tion of crucial files on your own computer. 
Sharing Files
Sharing files makes it easy for different people to work on a project. Without 
a network, you could give someone a copy of a file, but then you might sud­
denly have three different versions of the same file, and nobody would know 
which file contains the most accurate information. 
When your Mac is connected to a network, you have the option of sharing 
one or more folders with everyone else on the network. To share folders, 
you need to define different permission levels that allow or restrict what 
users can do with a folder and the files inside it:
	
✦	 Read & Write: Other users have the ability to retrieve, delete, and 
modify files in the shared folder.
	
✦	 Read Only: Other users can copy and open files, but they cannot 
modify or delete them.
	
✦	 Write Only (Drop Box): Other users can only place files in the folder; 
they cannot copy, open, or even see any files stored in that folder.
	
✦	 No Access: Specified users are blocked from accessing files on your Mac.

716
Sharing Files
You decide which folder (or folders) to share, who can access that folder, 
and what access level you want others to have in accessing your shared 
folder.
	
You don’t have to share folders. If you don’t share folders, you can still use 
a network to access someone else’s shared folders or use devices, such as 
printers, that are on the network.
Turning on file sharing
To turn on file sharing, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences to open the System Preferences 
window and then click the Sharing icon.
	
	 The Sharing pane appears, as shown in Figure 2-1.
	
Figure 2-1: 
The Sharing 
pane lets 
you turn on 
file sharing 
and choose 
folders to 
share.
	
	
2.	 Select the File Sharing check box in the leftmost Service column.
	
3.	 Click the plus sign button underneath the Shared Folders column.
	
	 A dialog appears, displaying all the drives and folders on your Mac, as 
shown in Figure 2-2.
	
4.	 Click a folder, such as the Public folder, which contains the Drop Box 
folder. The Public folder is in your Home folder.
	
	 The Drop Box folder is a Write Only folder that allows others to drop 
files in, but it doesn’t allow anyone (except you) to view and retrieve 
files.

5.	 Click Add.
	
6.	 Repeat Steps 4 through 6 for each additional folder you want to share 
via the network.
	
7.	 Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
Defining user access to shared folders
After you define one or more folders to share, you can also define the type of 
access people can have to your shared folders, such as giving certain people 
the ability to open and modify files and stopping other people from access­
ing your shared files.
The three types of network users are
	
✦	 Yourself: Gives you Read & Write access or else you won’t be able to 
modify any files in your shared folders.
	
✦	 Everyone: Allows others to access your shared folders as guests with­
out requiring a password.
	
✦	 Names of specific network users: Allows you to give individuals access 
to your shared folders with a name and password.
If you trust everyone on a network, you can give everyone Read & Write priv­
ileges to your shared folders. However, it’s probably best to give everyone 
Read privileges and only certain people Read & Write privileges. 
Defining access privileges for guests
To define access privileges for guests, follow these steps:

718

1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences to open the System Preferences 
window. 
	
2.	 Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Wireless category to open 
the Sharing pane. 
	
3.	 Click a folder in the Shared Folders list. 
	
	 The Users list enumerates all the people allowed to access this particu­
lar shared folder, as shown in Figure 2-3. By default, every shared folder 
lists your name with Read & Write privileges.
	
Figure 2-3: 
Each shared 
folder 
displays a 
list of users 
who can 
access that 
folder.
	
	
4.	 Click Everyone (the guest account) to call up the access option pop-up 
menu and choose an access option, such as Read & Write, Read Only, 
Write Only (Drop Box), or No Access. 
	
5.	 Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for each shared folder you want to configure.
	
6.	 Click the Close button of the System Preferences window.
Giving individuals access to shared folders
The access level you give to the Everyone account for a shared folder means 
anyone on the network has that level of access to your files — Read & Write, 
Read Only, Write Only. You probably want to give Everyone the minimum 
access to a shared folder and give specific individuals higher levels of 
access.

With OS X Snow Leopard, your Mac can share files even if you set up your 
Mac to sleep when it’s inactive for a certain time. (You can use this feature 
if your wireless network supports the 802.11n wireless protocol — see 
Book VIII, Chapter 1 for a brief explanation.) If you want your Mac to wake 
up when another user on the network wants to access your shared files, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences to open the System Preferences 
window. 
	
2.	 Click the Energy Saver icon in the Hardware category to open the 
Energy Saver pane.
	
3.	 Choose Power Adapter.

	 If you select the Guest radio button, skip to Step 8.
	
6.	 Click the Name text box and type the account name to use for access­
ing that shared folder.
	
	 The account name is the name that the computer’s user created in the 
earlier section, “Giving individuals access to shared folders.”
	
7.	 Click the Password text box and type the corresponding password.
	
8.	 Click Connect. 
	
	 Depending on your access to the shared folder, you might be able to 
copy, open, modify, or delete files.
	
Another way to access a shared folder is to type a shared folder’s AFP 
(Apple Filing Protocol) address into the Safari browser address text. To find 
a computer’s AFP address, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences to open the System Preferences 
window and then click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing pane. 
	
2.	 Click File Sharing in the Service list. 
	
	 Directly underneath the File Sharing: On text is the AFP address of that 
particular Mac, such as afp://192.168.1.2, as shown in Figure 2-10.

Sharing Printers
You could buy a separate printer for each computer on your network. 
However, this solution would be expensive and space-consuming. An alter­
native is to connect a printer directly to one computer, and configure that 
one computer to share its printer with any computer connected to the same 
network. To share a printer, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences to open the System Preferences 
window, and click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Wireless cat­
egory to open the Sharing pane. 
	
2.	 Select the Printer Sharing check box. 
	
	 A list of printers physically connected to your Mac appears, as shown in 
Figure 2-11.
	
3.	 Select the check boxes of the printers you want to share.
	
	 Note that Everyone Can Print is the default in the Users column.
	
4.	 (Optional) Add individual users just as you would for sharing files by 
clicking the plus sign button beneath the Users column; choose No 
Access for Everyone and give selected users access to that printer.
	
5.	 Click the Close button of the Sharing window. 
	
When you choose File➪Print in an application you’re using and you want to 
print from, a Print dialog appears. If you click the Printer pop-up menu and 
choose Add Printer, a window appears (as shown in Figure 2-12), listing all 
the available printers connected directly to your Mac (USB) or shared over 
the network (Bonjour or Bonjour Shared).

Bonjour is a networking standard developed by Apple, which is used by 
most printers to connect to other computers through Ethernet cables (wired 
networks) or through wireless (Wi-Fi) connections (802.11a/b/g/n). Because 
Apple released Bonjour as an open source standard, printer companies have 
written software drivers to make their printers compatible with Bonjour, 
meaning Windows users can download the Bonjour for Windows program 
free so Windows PCs can access shared printers on a network.

Sharing an Internet Connection
Sharing an Internet Connection
Sharing an Internet connection lets one Mac access the Internet through 
another Mac. For example, one laptop Mac might have access to the Internet 
through a wireless connection, but a second, older laptop Mac might not have 
a wireless adapter and might lack access to the Internet. With Internet Sharing 
turned on, the second Mac can access the Internet through the first Mac.
To share an Internet connection, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences to open the Systems Preferences 
window and then click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing pane. 
	
2.	 Click the Internet Sharing option in the list box on the left. 
	
	 Internet Sharing options appear, as shown in Figure 2-13.
	
3.	 From the Share Your Connection From pop-up menu, choose how your 
Mac is connected to the Internet: Ethernet, AirPort, External Modem, 
or Bluetooth PAN.

✓	Configuring Bluetooth
✓	Pairing devices
✓	Sharing through Bluetooth
B
luetooth is the name of a wireless technology standard designed pri­
marily for connecting devices within a short distance of one another 
rather than through networks where one computer is in one room and 
another computer is in a room on another floor of the building — or on the 
other side of the globe.
Because of its short-range nature, Bluetooth is handy for connecting com­
puters for short periods and for transferring small files, unlike faster wired 
or wireless (Wi-Fi) networks that connect computers on a more permanent 
basis.
Many handheld devices, such as mobile phones and personal digital assis­
tants (PDAs), have built-in Bluetooth capabilities, which makes it easy to 
wirelessly sync calendars and address books between a handheld device 
and a computer (as explained in Book II, Chapter 3).
Common Bluetooth-enabled peripherals you can use with your Mac, such as 
wireless keyboards and mice, and headsets for chatting with iChat or using 
Internet phone services like Skype, can also connect to your Mac by using 
your Mac’s built-in Bluetooth feature.
	
Bluetooth can connect devices up to 30 feet (10 meters) away, although any 
obstacles, such as walls, can limit the range of a Bluetooth device. 
Identifying Bluetooth Capabilities
All new and recent Macs have Bluetooth capabilities. If you have a Mac 
that’s more than a few years old, chances are, your Mac does not have 
Bluetooth capability built-in. In that case, you need to buy a Bluetooth 
adapter that plugs into a USB port or fits inside your Mac. 

730
Configuring Bluetooth
	
	 To determine if your Mac has Bluetooth capability, choose Ú➪System 
Preferences to open the System Preferences window. Then look for the 
Bluetooth preferences icon like the one shown in the margin.
If you see a Bluetooth preferences icon, your Mac has Bluetooth capability. If 
you don’t see a Bluetooth icon, your Mac doesn’t have Bluetooth capability.
Configuring Bluetooth
After you determine that your Mac has Bluetooth capability (either built-in 
or added through a Bluetooth adapter that you bought separately), you can 
configure how Bluetooth works on your Mac. For example, you might not 
want to allow other computers to browse your hard drive through Bluetooth 
without your express permission. Otherwise, it’s possible for someone to 
access your Mac and browse its hard disk from across the room, and you 
would never know it. 
To configure how Bluetooth works on your Mac, follow these steps: 
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences to open the System Preferences 
window and then click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing prefer­
ences pane.
	
2.	 Select the Bluetooth Sharing check box. 
	
	 A list of Bluetooth options appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.

Configuring Bluetooth
	
3.	 Choose one of the following from the When Receiving Items pop-up 
menu:
 
• Accept and Save: Automatically saves any files sent to you through 
Bluetooth. (Not recommended because someone can send you a 
malicious program, such as a virus or Trojan Horse, which can wipe 
out your files when opened.)
 
• Accept and Open: Automatically saves and opens any files sent to you 
through Bluetooth. (Not recommended because this — like the previ­
ous option — could automatically run a malicious program sent to 
your Mac through Bluetooth.)
 
• Ask What to Do: Displays a dialog that gives you the option of accept­
ing or rejecting a file sent to you through Bluetooth — probably your 
best choice.
 
• Never Allow: Always blocks anyone from sending you files through 
Bluetooth.
	
4.	 Select or deselect the Require Pairing check box.
	
	 If selected, this check box won’t let anyone send files to you until you pair 
that other computer with your own. Pairing links another device specifi­
cally to your Mac, and is commonly used to link Bluetooth keyboards, 
mice, and the Apple Remote to a specific Mac. I explain that next.
	
5.	 Choose either Documents or Other from the Folder for Accepted Items 
pop-up menu.
	
	 If you choose Other, an Open dialog appears, letting you click a folder 
where you want to store any files sent to you through Bluetooth.
	
6.	 Choose one of the following from the When Other Devices Browse 
pop-up menu:
 
• Always Allow: Automatically gives another Bluetooth device full 
access to the contents of your Mac. (Not recommended — this 
allows others to mess up your files accidentally or deliberately.)
 
• Ask What to Do: Displays a dialog that gives you the option of accept­
ing or rejecting another device trying to access your Mac through 
Bluetooth.
 
• Never Allow: Always blocks anyone from browsing through your Mac 
using Bluetooth.
	
7.	 Select or deselect the Require Pairing check box. 
	
	 Generally, you want pairing because pairing lets you selectively choose 
which devices can access your Mac through Bluetooth.

Pairing a Device
	
8.	 Choose either Public or Other from the Folder Others Can Browse 
pop-up menu. 
	
	 If you choose Other, an Open dialog appears, letting you select a folder 
that you can share.
	
	 Choosing Desktop as the folder you want to share can make it easier to 
keep track of files you want to send (or those you receive) if you plan to 
share files this way only occasionally, on an as-needed basis.
	
9.	 Click the Close button of the System Preferences window. 
Pairing a Device
Pairing allows you to predetermine which Bluetooth-enabled devices can 
connect to your Mac. By pairing, you can keep strangers from trying to 
access your Mac without your knowledge. For additional security, you can 
also require that paired devices use a password (also called a passkey) that 
further verifies that a specific device is allowed to connect to your Mac.
Pairing with your Mac
To pair a device with your Mac, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences to open the System Preferences 
window and then click the Bluetooth icon. 
	
	 The Bluetooth preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 3-2.
	
2.	 Click the Set Up New Device button. 
	
	 The Bluetooth Setup Assistant window appears and immediately begins 
searching for Bluetooth devices.

Removing a paired device from your Mac
After you pair a device with your Mac, you might want to remove it later. To 
remove a paired device from your Mac, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Ú➪System Preferences to open the System Preferences 
window and then click the Bluetooth icon. 
	
	 A Bluetooth preferences pane appears, as shown in Figure 3-5, listing all 
devices paired with your Mac.
	
2.	 Click to select the device you want to unlink from your Mac and then 
click the minus sign button in the bottom-left corner of the Bluetooth 
window.
	
	 A dialog appears, warning you that if you disconnect this device, it will 
no longer be available to your Mac.
	
3.	 Click Remove.

Sharing through Bluetooth
Because Bluetooth lets you create a simple, short-range network between 
Macs, you can use a Bluetooth network to share files or even an Internet 
connection with others. Such a simple network isn’t meant to share mas­
sive numbers of files or an Internet connection for a long-term basis, but it 
is handy for quick file copying, browsing a Web page, or sending a photo or 
song to a mobile phone or iPod.
	
The speed of ordinary networks connected through Ethernet cables is 10, 
100, or 1,000 megabits per second (Mbps), whereas the maximum speed of a 
Bluetooth network is only 1 Mbps.

Sharing through Bluetooth
Sharing files
When you want to copy a file from your Mac to another device, such as 
another Mac or a mobile phone, you can set up a Bluetooth connection. 
Sharing files through Bluetooth allows you to transfer files to another device 
without the hassle of using connecting cables or mutually compatible remov­

T
he Mac is best known for its graphics capabilities. Although many com­
panies, such as Adobe, sell virtually identical graphics programs for 
both Mac and Windows computers, the majority of professional artists and 
graphic designers use the Mac. 
One common way to play with graphics is to modify an existing image. Many 
people capture pictures with a digital camera and then touch up those pic­
tures in a graphics-editing program.
Another way to use graphics is to create an image from scratch. Creating 
graphics from scratch isn’t necessarily difficult, but it can be time-consuming. 
As a result, creating graphics is the realm of most professionals, whereas edit­
ing graphics is common to both amateurs and professionals.
Understanding Painting versus Drawing
Two types of graphics programs are painting and drawing programs. The 
main difference between the two is the way the programs create, edit, and 
display pictures.
A painting program draws pictures using individual dots called pixels. A 
single picture can consist of millions of individual pixels. By changing the 
color of these pixels, you can change the appearance of an image.
Pictures made of pixels are called raster images. When you take a picture 
with a digital camera, your camera stores that picture as a raster image. 

740
Understanding Painting versus Drawing
If you capture a picture using a scanner, your scanner saves that picture 
as a raster image, too. The most popular raster-editing program is Adobe 
Photoshop.
The biggest disadvantage of raster images is that you can’t resize them. The 
more you enlarge a raster image, the grainier and chunkier it gets, as shown 
in Figure A-1.
	
Figure A-1: 
Enlarged 
raster 
images 
appear 
chunky and 
grainy.
	
The alternative to a painting program is a drawing program. Drawing pro­
grams store pictures as vector graphics. Whereas a raster image physically 
draws an image on the screen, vector graphics store images as mathematical 
equations that define how to display an image on the screen.
A vector graphics picture consists of multiple items called primitives, such 
as points, lines, curves, and shapes. A mathematical equation tells the com­
puter where to place the items and each item’s width, length, height, and 
color. As a result, vector graphics generally don’t display the subtle details 
that a raster image does, but vector graphics can be resized without losing 
resolution, as shown in Figure A-2.
Vector graphics typically consist of separate items that you can modify and 
manipulate individually. This gives vector graphics more of a cartoon look 
than a realistic image. Because the resolution of vector graphics remains 
sharp, no matter how large you make the picture or what resolution you 
use to display the image, vector graphics are used in many Web page adver­
tisements and animated movies. One popular vector graphics program is 
Adobe Flash.

Many companies sell libraries of clip art images that you can use to spice up 
a document or desktop publishing file. Sometimes these clip art images are 
vector images, which let you resize them without degrading their appear­
ance, but sometimes these clip art images are raster images, and resizing 
them can make them look grainy.
Common Raster-Editing Features
Editing involves a two-step process. First, you must select the item you 
want to modify. Second, you have to choose a command to modify your 
selected item.
In most programs, such as a word processor or a spreadsheet, you can easily 
select text by dragging the mouse. In a graphics program, selecting parts of a 
picture can be much harder because, in contrast to text, there isn’t always a 
clear boundary of what to choose. When looking at a digital photograph of a 
man, how can you tell the computer to select just the man’s face but not his 
mustache or hat? Computers see every raster image as just as series of col­
ored pixels, so selecting which pixels you want to manipulate can be tricky.
To help you select all or part of an image, raster-editing programs offer tools 
that usually appear as icons in a group known as a toolbox, as shown in 

742
Common Raster-Editing Features
Figure A-3. After selecting a tool, you can use the mouse to select and manip­
ulate a picture in different ways.

Text tool
In the following list, I briefly describe the tools called out in Figure A-3:
	
✦	 Hand tool: Click and drag on your document to move it around on the 
screen.
	
✦	 Rectangular Selection tool: Use this for clicking and dragging a rect­
angle marquee around a section you want to copy or cut.
	
✦	 Rectangle (or box) Shape tool: Click to select and then drag on docu­
ment and let go to draw a square. The tiny triangle in the lower-right 
corner indicates more options, such as line thickness and whether your 
box is see-through or filled with a pattern.
	
✦	 Paintbrush tool: Use this for freehand painting with brush strokes.
	
✦	 Text tool: Use this tool to add text to your document
	
✦	 Pattern, color and other shape and texture choices: These tools enable 
you to create objects and to fill in objects you draw.
	
The toolbox shown in Figure A-3 comes from Photoshop Elements; other 
graphics programs likely display tool icons in different positions.

743
Common Raster-Editing Features
Selecting an entire picture
The simplest way to select a raster image is to select an entire image by 
pressing Ô+A. (In some programs, you can also choose this command by 
choosing Edit➪Select All or just Select➪All.)
After you select an entire picture, you can modify that entire picture by 
rotating it, making it lighter or darker, increasing/decreasing its contrast, 
and converting a color picture to black and white.
	
Many raster-editing programs also offer a Select Invert command. When you want 
to select a large area of a picture except for a small region in the middle, it’s actu­
ally easier to select the small region in the middle first. Then use the Select Invert 
command to select the opposite region, the large region that you actually want.
Selecting an area
Instead of selecting a whole picture, you can also select part of a picture. 
You can’t select part of a picture until you choose a selection tool, which 
typically appears in a toolbox (refer to Figure A-3).
One of the simplest ways to select part of a picture is to select a rectangular 
or elliptical area. To select a rectangular or circular part of a picture, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Click the rectangular or elliptical selection tool in the toolbox and 
move the pointer over the part of the picture you want to select.
	
2.	 Hold down the mouse button and drag the mouse.
	
	 The selection tool draws a dotted line, called a marquee, around your 
selected item, as shown in Figure A-4.
	
Figure A-4: 
Dragging 
the mouse

around your 
selection.
	

744
Common Raster-Editing Features
Selecting an irregular shape
The problem with the rectangular and elliptical selection tools is that the 
part that you want to edit will almost never be perfectly rectangular or 
elliptical. Because images in a picture are often irregularly shaped (think of 
the shape of a puppy’s face in a digital photograph), most raster-editing pro­
grams offer a special tool called a Lasso tool.
The Lasso tool lets you drag the mouse and draw the boundaries of the area 
you want to select, as shown in Figure A-5.
	
Figure A-5: 
The Lasso 
tool can 
select an 
irregular 
shape.
	
Variations of the Lasso tool
Although the Lasso tool can select irregular 
shapes, it can also be clumsy to use because 
it requires a steady hand to drag the mouse 
exactly where you want to select part of a pic­
ture. To compensate for this, some programs 
offer two varieties of the Lasso tool called the 
Polygonal Lasso tool and the Magnetic Lasso 
tool.
The Polygonal Lasso tool lets you point and 
click to draw straight lines. By letting you 
click the mouse around an area, the Polygonal 
Lasso tool makes it easy to select an irregularly 
shaped part of a picture.
The Magnetic Lasso tool lets you drag the 
mouse around an area, but it’s smart enough 
to detect contrast differences between differ­
ent parts of a picture. So rather than force you 
to drag the mouse exactly around a selected 
area in a picture, the Magnetic Lasso tool lets 
you drag the mouse approximately near an area 
you want to select, and the Magnetic Lasso tool 
automatically selects the boundary of an area.

745
Common Raster-Editing Features
Selecting with the Magic Wand tool
Dragging the mouse to select an area might still be difficult, especially if the 
item you want to select consists of multiple irregular shapes, such as a tree 
branch. In cases like this, it might be easier to select the color of a picture by 
using the Magic Wand tool.
The Magic Wand tool selects adjacent pixels based on color. Therefore, if 
you want to select the blue sky behind a tree, you can click the Magic Wand 
tool and then click the blue sky. The Magic Wand tool selects the blue pixels 
that you click, along with any adjacent blue pixels. By adjusting the sensi­
tivity of the Magic Wand tool, you can make it select more or fewer pixels. 
Additionally, if you select the Magic Wand tool and then click the black por­
tion of a picture, you select all adjacent black areas, as shown in Figure A-6.
	
Figure A-6: 
The Magic 
Wand can 
select areas 
that contain 
similar 
colors.
	
Erasing pixels
One common way to modify a picture is to erase part of it, which you can 
do by using the Eraser tool. When you choose the Eraser tool, you can drag 
the mouse over a picture and wipe out the pixels underneath, as shown in 
Figure A-7.

746
Common Raster-Editing Features
	
Figure A-7: 
The Eraser 
tool wipes 
out anything 
that you 
drag the 
mouse over.
	
By changing the shape and size of the Eraser tool, you can trim away parts of 
a picture without erasing the parts that you want to keep. For added flexibil­
ity, many raster-editing programs offer a Magic Eraser tool. Like the Magic 
Wand tool, which selects an area based on similar colors, the Magic Eraser 
tool erases adjacent pixels that contain similar colors.
Using the Paint Brush and Paint Bucket tools
Rather than erase part of your picture, you might want to color pixels. By 
changing the color of pixels, you can change the appearance of an image, 
such as creating a third eye on someone’s forehead or coloring in a tear in a 
scanned photograph to make the tear disappear.
To color pixels, raster-editing programs offer a Paint Brush and Paint Bucket 
tool. The Paint Brush tool lets you use the pointer as a brush by clicking and 
dragging the mouse
If you need to paint a large area, dragging the mouse with the Paint Brush 
tool can get tedious, so raster-editing programs offer a Paint Bucket tool, 
which colors in any enclosed area. To use the Paint Bucket tool, just click it 
in the toolbox and then click the color that you want to use. Next, click the 
part of your picture that you want to color and your chosen color floods that 
part of your picture as if you spilled a bucket of paint over it.
	
As an alternative to clicking a color, many raster-editing programs offer a 
special Eyedropper tool. The purpose of the Eyedropper tool is to let you 
choose an existing color in your picture. After you click a color in your pic­
ture, the Paint Brush or Paint Bucket tool can use that color in another area.

747
Common Vector-Editing Features
Common Vector-Editing Features
Unlike raster-editing programs that modify individual pixels, vector graph­
ics–editing programs modify objects. To create a picture, a vector graphics 
program gives you various tools for drawing different types of objects, called 
primitives. Some common primitive objects are lines, curves, and points.
After you create a picture using primitive objects, you can modify those 
primitives using a variety of tools that scale (enlarge or shrink) or reshape 
those primitives.
Moving and resizing objects with the Selection tool
Vector graphics consist of multiple objects. When you use the Selection 
tool, you can move or resize one or more objects by selecting them with a 
Selection tool and then dragging them with the mouse. To use the Selection 
tool, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Selection tool, which usually appears as a dark arrow in the 
toolbox.
	
2.	 Click an object you want to modify, such as a line.
	
	 Handles appear around your object, as shown in Figure A-8, which dis­
plays the EazyDraw program.
	
3.	 (Optional) To move your selected object, move the pointer to your 
selected object, hold the mouse button, and drag the mouse.
	
	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new location of 
your object.
	
4.	 (Optional) To resize your selected object, move the pointer to a 
handle, hold down the mouse button, and drag the mouse.
	
	 Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the new size of your 
object.
	
After selecting an object with the Selection tool, you can press Delete if you 
want to remove that selected object.
Reshaping an object with the Direct Selection tool
Rather than move or change the size of an object, you might want to modify 
the shape of an object, which you can change by using the Direct Selection 
tool. This tool often appears as a white arrow pointer directly underneath 
the Selection tool icon in the toolbox.

748
Common Vector-Editing Features
	
Figure A-8: 
The 
Selection 
tool lets you 
choose an 
object to 
modify.
	
Handles
When you click an object with the Direct Selection tool, that object displays 
anchor points and direction points. Anchor points appear as squares directly 
on an object. By dragging an anchor point, you can reshape an object. 
Direction points appear as lines with a circle or point on each end. By drag­
ging a direction point, you can reshape the curve of an object. Figure A-9 
shows an image displayed in the Intaglio drawing program.
	
Vector graphics programs sometimes use different terms to describe 
identical items. For example, Adobe Illustrator has a Direct Selection tool; 
however, another program might call the same tool a Point Selection tool. 
Just remember that the names might be different, but the functions remain 
the same.
To use the Direct Selection tool, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Direct Selection tool, which usually appears as a white arrow 
in the toolbox.

anchor point, hold down the mouse button, and drag the mouse.
	
	 Release the mouse button when you’re done.
	
4.	 (Optional) To change the curve of an object, move the pointer to a 
direction point, hold down the mouse button, and drag the mouse.
	
	 Release the mouse button when you’re done.

750
Common Vector-Editing Features
Drawing lines
To create lines, vector graphics programs typically offer a Pencil tool, a Line 
tool, a Pen tool, and different Shape tools, as shown in Figure A-10.
	
Figure A-10: 
The Pencil, 
Pen, Line, 
and Shape 
tools let you 
create new 
objects.
	
Pen Pencil
Shape tools
Line
The Pencil tool lets you draw a line by dragging the mouse. Doing so creates 
lines of any shape along any path you select.
The Line tool lets you draw straight lines by dragging the mouse. After you 
draw a straight line, you can always reshape it, but if you need a perfectly 
straight line, the Line tool will meet your needs.
The Shape tools (Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, Polygon, and Oval) let you 
draw specific shapes, which you also can reshape.
The Pen tool lets you draw a line by clicking define points. Each time you 
click another point, the drawing program draws a connecting straight line. 
To curve a line, you can drag the direction points that appear. Some drawing 
programs might also let you drag the Pen tool to create curved lines.

751
Choosing a Painting and Drawing Program
Choosing a Painting and Drawing Program
If you’re a professional or aspiring graphic designer, your only real choices 
are Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Flash (www.adobe.
com). The graphic design industry heavily uses all three programs.
Although these programs are mandatory for graphic design professionals, 
most other people will likely find Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash 
too expensive and complicated to use. As an alternative to these three 
professional-quality programs, you can find plenty of low-cost (or even free) 
programs that offer most of the features of these programs.
Photoshop alternatives
Perhaps the best alternative to Photoshop is a similar, less expensive program 
dubbed Photoshop Elements, which is also sold by Adobe. Adobe markets 
Photoshop to professionals and Photoshop Elements to digital photography 
hobbyists who want to touch up their digital photographs quickly and easily.
If you like the idea of an easy-to-use digital photography editor, consider these 
programs geared for beginners: PhotoStudio 6 (www.arcsoft.com), Color It! 
(www.microfrontier.com), GraphicsConverter (www.lemkesoft.com), 
and Pixelmator (www.pixelmator.com).
Specialized digital photography 
editors and organizers
Programs such as Photoshop can help you edit 
and modify digital photographs, but they do 
nothing to help you organize your digital photo­
graphs. If you work exclusively with digital pho­
tographs, you might want to skip Photoshop and 
consider Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 (www.
adobe.com) or Apple Aperture 2 (www.
apple.com), programs especially designed 
for professional photographers.
Lightroom 2 and Aperture 2 organize, sort, edit, 
and store your digital photographs. Both pro­
grams also offer nondestructive editing, which 
means your original digital image is never 
changed. This means that you can always 
return to your original image without having to 
make a separate copy of that image.
After you make changes to a digital photo­
graph, you can organize and sort the photo in 
a library so that you can find it again. You can 
also create a slideshow of your favorite images 
or print your pictures in different ways (such 
as one big picture on a page or several smaller 
pictures on a page).
Think of Lightroom 2 and Aperture 2 as 
advanced versions of the iPhoto program. If 
you need only to organize your digital images 
occasionally, iPhoto should be sufficient. But 
if you’re constantly storing, editing, and orga­
nizing digital images, consider Lightroom 2 or 
Aperture 2. 

752
Choosing a Painting and Drawing Program
Although it’s not much cheaper or easier to use than Photoshop, another 
alternative raster editor is Corel Painter 11 (www.corel.com). Whereas 
Photoshop specializes in editing digital photographs, Corel Painter special­
izes in mimicking the use of ordinary artist tools, such as drawing with char­
coal or creating oil paintings on different types of paper and canvases where 
your ink or oil paints can drip and soak into the surface just like the real 
thing. If you’re an aspiring artist and want a program specifically designed to 
mimic the handheld tools you’re already familiar with, Corel Painter might 
actually be a better choice for you than Photoshop.
Before you buy any raster editor, grab a free copy of Paintbrush (http://
paintbrush.sourceforge.net). If you have children, grab a free copy of 
TuxPaint (www.tuxpaint.org), a simple painting program designed to help 
kids learn the basics of painting with a computer.
Illustrator alternatives
Although designed mostly for editing raster images, Adobe Photoshop also 
includes some vector drawing capabilities. If you need to create vector draw­
ings every now and then, you can use Photoshop and never bother with a 
separate vector graphics program at all. However, you might prefer using a 
simpler vector drawing program.
For a free vector graphics program, use the Draw program included in 
OpenOffice (www.openoffice.org) and NeoOffice (www.neooffice.org). 
If you need to draw diagrams, organizational charts, or flow charts, consider 
OmniGraffle (www.omnigroup.com).
In case you need a drawing program for creating technical illustrations, you 
could use any drawing program, but you might be better off using Canvas 
11 (www.deneba.com). In addition to letting you create technical drawings, 
Canvas 11 also offers options for scientific imaging and geographical infor­
mation systems (GIS), which can be handy if you need to draw molecular 
structures or create maps.
If you just want a simpler, less expensive version of Adobe Illustrator, 
consider Intaglio (www.purgatorydesign.com). Instead of attempting to 
offer as many features as possible, as Illustrator does, Intaglio offers the 
basic features that most people need 90 percent of the time. As a result, 
Intaglio lets you focus more on your work and less on trying to find the 
features you need. 
Another low-cost drawing program for novices is Lineform (www.freeverse.
com). One unique feature of Lineform is that of artistic strokes, which com­
bines the visual appearance of brush strokes found in painting programs 

753
Graphic File Formats
with the ability to edit and manipulate them as separate objects, as in a 
drawing program.
A third low-cost drawing program is EazyDraw (www.eazydraw.com). 
Although geared for beginners, EazyDraw actually offers some advanced 
features for mechanical drawings, printed circuit layouts, and electronic 
schematics. 
If you want to create simple animated drawings, get iDraw (www.macpower
user.com), which can save your drawings as animated GIF, Flash, or 
QuickTime movies. Despite its animation capabilities, iDraw offers a simpli­
fied user interface that won’t overwhelm you with options. 
Flash alternatives
Flash actually consists of two separate programs. First, there’s the Flash 
development program, which lets you design and create Flash animation. 
Second, there’s the free Flash player, which lets Safari or your preferred Web 
browser display Flash movies and animation. If you need to create Flash ani­
mation for different purposes, you can buy the Flash development program 
(www.adobe.com).
If you want to create cartoons in Flash but don’t want to buy the Flash devel­
opment program, alternatives are Toon Boom Studio (www.toonboom.com), 
and Anime Studio Debut 6 and Anime Studio Pro (www.e-frontier.com). 
Although all three programs use the Flash file format, they provide tools to 
help you create and animate cartoons much faster than the Flash develop­
ment program.
All three programs specialize in helping you draw characters, animate them, 
and even synchronize audio with the movements of their mouths so that the 
characters appear to speak naturally. If you’re just getting started with Flash 
animation, you might want to buy the less costly Anime Studio Debut 6. 
When you get familiar with creating Flash animation, you can move up to the 
costlier but more powerful Anime Studio Pro.
Graphic File Formats
Because Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash lead the market in raster 
editing, vector graphics, and vector graphics animation, the three most 
important file formats are Photoshop’s PSD format, Illustrator’s AI format, 
and Flash’s SWF format. Although these file formats are the most popular, 
most painting and drawing programs can use other file formats as well.

754
Graphic File Formats
	
You can easily save a vector graphics file as a raster file, but then you lose 
the ability to manipulate the objects of that picture. If you save a raster 
picture as a vector graphics picture, you won’t be able to modify its parts 
as though it were a true vector graphics picture. (Adobe Illustrator offers a 
raster-to-vector graphics conversion feature, but most drawing programs 
don’t.) If you need to manipulate individual parts of a picture, create and 
save your picture as a vector graphics file. If you need to manipulate indi­
vidual pixels, create and save your picture as a raster file.
Raster (painting) formats
In addition to Photoshop PSD files, another popular raster file format is TIFF 
(Tagged Image File Format). TIFF was designed as a universal graphics file 
format, so most graphics programs can save and open TIFF files.
TIFF files are, like Photoshop PSD files, often large, which makes them imprac­
tical for use on Web pages. To display graphics on a Web page, Web designers 
use three file formats that compress images yet retain much of the visual qual­
ity. The most popular of these raster compressed file formats is JPEG (Joint 
Photographic Experts Group), which is also used by many digital cameras. 
JPEG files are great for storing photographic-quality images, but if you just 
need simple graphics, such as company logos or cartoons, then you’ll find 
that the GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) file format is more popular. 
Because the GIF format was patented at one time, a free alternative appeared 
known as PNG (Portable Network Graphics).
PNG files offer better compression than GIF files and unlike JPEG files, PNG 
files can shrink files in size without tossing out data, thus preserving image 
quality.
	
One file format used exclusively with digital cameras is RAW, which stores 
images in a format that must be converted before you can edit or print. The 
advantage of the RAW format is its ability to store more data about an image, 
which can give you higher-quality digital photographs. Two big drawbacks 
with the RAW format is that these files tend to be much larger than equiva­
lent JPEG files, and every digital camera manufacturer creates its own RAW 
format that is incompatible with RAW formats created by other digital cam­
eras. If you can’t convert your RAW formats into a universal file format, such 
as JPEG, you could trap your images in a particular RAW format forever.
Vector graphics (drawing) formats
Adobe Illustrator AI files are the most popular vector graphics formats, so 
many drawing programs can open and save AI files and save files in an open 
standard called SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). 

755
Graphic File Formats
Another popular open standard format for vector graphics is EPS 
(Encapsulated PostScript). Much like SVG files, EPS files are often used as 
an intermediary file format to transfer files from one drawing program to 
another. 
Although not an open standard, many vector graphics programs can also 
store pictures as PDF (Portable Document Format) files. PDF files are used 
to display the exact formatting and appearance of a picture so that others 
can view and print it on their own computers. To read PDF files, you can use 
the Preview program that comes with every Mac, or you can download a free 
copy of the Adobe Acrobat Reader.

the interface, and the Mac approach to files and folders
•  Mac specials — get more from Dashboard widgets, back up with 
Time Machine®, and meet the Automator
•  That’s entertainment — listen to music, watch movies, and play 
online games
•  Connect — browse the Web; use e-mail, iChat instant messaging 
and video conferences; and set up Internet security options
•  Get creative — make albums of your digital photos, compose 
and record music, and build your own Web site
•  Mac at work — learn the capabilities of iWork’s document, 
presentation, and spreadsheet programs
•  Organize your life — manage contacts with Address Book and
