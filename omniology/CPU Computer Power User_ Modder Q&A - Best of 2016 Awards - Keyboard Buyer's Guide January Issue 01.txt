Corsair Speeds Up Storage 
With Force Series MP500 SSDs
CORSAIR has announced its fastest line of solid-state 
drives. The new Force Series MP500 drives use the M.2 
2280 form factor and the NVMe flash storage protocol to 
transfer data at read speeds up to 3,000MBps and write 
speeds up to 2,400MBps. CORSAIR says the Force Series 
MP500 drives will come in 120GB, 240GB, and 480GB 
capacities. The 120GB version is already available on the 
company’s website for $109.99. (As we went to press, 
there was no word on pricing for the other sizes or how 
soon they will be available.) Along with a tiny form factor 
and blazing speed, the new drives come with proprietary 
technologies from CORSAIR that increase data reliability 
and protect data from being corrupted during sudden 
shutdowns or other power losses. The drives are compatible 
with Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, and they 
come with three-year warranties.
Swiftech Releases Komodo RX480 
Waterblock For AMD Radeon Cards
Swiftech has released a new waterblock, the Komodo RX480, 
designed for graphics cards using AMD’s Radeon RX 480 
GPUs. The Komodo RX480 is a full-cover block that cools a 
card’s memory and power regulation areas in addition to the 
GPU. According to Swiftech, the new Komodo waterblock 
includes an “advanced thermal design and low flow 
restriction” that combine to improve cooling performance. 
As a secondary benefit, the waterblock also provides added 
protection for the graphics card because it covers the entire 
PCB area. This strengthens the card and protects it from 
bending. The coverage also protects components on the card 
from bumps and scrapes that can occur when users are adding 
or removing other parts from their systems. The Komodo 
RX480 waterblock has an MSRP of $99.95. Swiftech also 
sells a backplate ($29.95), lighting strip ($11.95), and light 
controller ($12.95) as separate accessories for the waterblock.

HARDWARE MOLE
Spire Rolls Out New MicroATX 
Chassis Option, The Tricer 1411
Netherlands-based component manufacturer Spire has 
announced the Tricer 1411, a new microATX chassis for 
enthusiasts building small-form-factor rigs. The steel chassis 
measures just 14.9 x 6.7 x 14.6 inches (HxWxD) and includes 
a reinforced drive bay rack in front for optical drives, SSDs, or 
hard drives. 
The compact case comes with one 120mm exhaust fan but 
has mounts inside for up to two 92mm and two 120mm fans. 
There are four expansion slots, and the side panels have thumb 
screws for easy removal. The front panel includes one USB 3.0, 
two USB 2.0, and HD/AC97 Audio connections.
The Tricer 1411 has an MSRP of just $49.99.
BitFenix Plans Whisper M PSU Line
BitFenix has a new line of PSUs coming soon under the 
name Whisper M. The new ATX power supplies are 
certified 80-PLUS Gold and will be available in 450-, 
550-, 650-, 750-, and 850-watt capacities. The Whisper 
M comes with a 135mm FDB (fluid dynamic bearing) 
fan that BitFenix says will generate a noise level of less 
than 18dBA when the PSU is operating with a load of 
less than 60% at 25 degrees C. The intelligent fans start 
working at only 3.5v and at an extremely low RPM. The 
higher-wattage Whisper M models come with quad 12V 
rails (450W and 550W have three rails), and the rails 
have varying load limits. BitFenix says the GPU rails can 
handle higher current capacities. The power supplies are 
completely modular and come with flat ribbon cabling.

ASUS Announces Xonar U7 MKII
The Xonar U7 MKII from ASUS combines a 7.1 
surround-sound card with a headphone amplifier and 
provides up to 192kHz/24-bit output. The unit comes in 
a small, attractive form factor with a large volume control 
knob on top. The audio card has a Cirrus Logic CS4398 
DAC and includes ASUS Hyper Grounding technology, 
which reduces interference and improves signal clarity. 
ASUS claims the Xonar’s 114db SNR (signal-to-noise 
ratio) provides up to 16 times the audio clarity of the 
typical PC setup, which has an average 90db SNR for 
onboard audio. ASUS also suggests that users with home 
surround-sound systems that lack HDMI inputs can use 
the analog or S/PDIF outputs on the Xonar U7 MKII 
to run their gaming audio through their home surround-
sound setups.

Computers Could Someday 
“Explain” Their Decisions 
While neural networks, which look for patterns in data to yield 
useful predictions or classifications, have proven successful 
at classifying data, they can’t explain why they came to those 
conclusions, according to MIT. Researchers are working to solve 
that by developing a way to train the networks so they provide 
predictions and classifications along with rationales for their 
decisions. Initial research focused on textual data. Researchers 
divided a neural network into two modules: the first module 
takes segments of data and scores them according to length and 
coherence, and a second module takes those scores and performs 
the prediction or classification. By training the modules together, 
the goal is to maximize the score of the extracted data segments 
and the accuracy of the prediction or classification. These improved 
neural networks could have widespread possibilities, including 
medical decision-making and anywhere “the cost of making the 
wrong prediction is very high,” said MIT Professor Regina Barzilay.

Researchers Use Deep Learning 
To Improve Automated Lip Reading 
Lip reading is an important part of communication, but it’s a 
notoriously difficult task for humans to master, and automated 
processes or machines have difficulty extracting the space 
and time features needed to be 
successful, according to researchers 
at the University of Oxford. But 
a new lip-reading system being 
developed by the Department of 
Computer Science has surpassed 
both humans and previous 
automatic lip-reading systems. The LipNet software makes use 
of spatiotemporal (space/time) movements, an LSTM recurrent 
network, and other elements to map a variable-length sequence 
of video frames to text and make sentence-level predictions. 
Facebook Bug Bounty Program 
Marks Fifth Year By Expanding
Facebook is celebrating the fifth anniversary of its Bug 
Bounty program. The program, which the company 
describes as providing recognition and compensation to 
security researchers practicing responsible disclosure, covers 
several Facebook features, products, and acquisitions, 
including Atlas, Instagram, Oculus, and Internet.org. In the 
five years since starting the bounty program, Facebook has 
awarded more than $5 
million to more than 
900 researchers who 
spotted and reported 
bugs. In a recent blog 
post, Joey Tyson, a 
security engineer who 
works on the Facebook 
Bug Bounty team, 
said the company 
received more than 
9,000 reports in the 
first six months of last year and awarded $611,741 to 149 
researchers. India, the United States, and Mexico were the 
top three countries receiving the largest number of payouts. 
Tyson said Facebook is always looking to improve and 
expand the program and this year added WhatsApp to the 
list of programs covered, expanded payment options to 
include Bitcoin, and switched to an automated payment 
process to pay researchers faster.
Unlike previous lip-reading programs, which focus on word 
classification, LipNet is the first to provide sentence-level 
sequence prediction, the researchers note. In testing on the 
GRID corpus, LipNet reached sentence-level word accuracy 
levels of up to 93.4%; hearing-impaired people who can read 
lips are known to achieve accuracy levels of up to 52.3%.
The researchers note that machine 
lip readers have enormous potential 
in hearing aid development, covert 
conversations, speech recognition in 
noisy environments, and other areas. 
Although LipNet has shown great 
potential, the researchers point out that development is in the 
early stages. The test dataset covered short, formulaic videos with a 
well-lit person face-on, the researchers say, so a next logical step is 
to improve the system to work on more challenging video footage.

High Number Of Millennials Falling 
Victim To Tech Support Scams  
A new report by Microsoft shows some rather startling results 
regarding tech support scams. Among those stats? Nearly two-
thirds of users globally have experienced a tech support scam 
in the past 12 months, and while 17% of victims were 55 or 
older, 50% were between 18 and 34 years old and 34% were 
between the ages of 36 and 54. In an article discussing the report, 
Courtney Gregoire, a senior attorney in Microsoft’s Digital 
Crimes Unit, said that, although those numbers challenge many 
preconceived notions that fraudsters target senior citizens, the 
research also shows that fraudsters are evolving their tactics, 
using pop-ups, unsolicited email, and scam websites as entry 
points, to attract a broader number of people. Of those who have 
experienced a tech support scam, one in five continued with a 
potentially fraudulent interaction such as downloading software, 
visiting a scam website, giving scammers remote access to a 
device, or providing credit card or other payment information.
Elon Musk Moves SpaceX’s Plans 
One Step Closer To Blastoff 
Generally slower than most forms of terrestrial internet access 
with the exception of dial-up, satellite internet usually only 
finds favor with users who don’t have access to traditional 
broadband options. If anyone can change that, though, it’s 
Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX recently filed an 
application with the FCC to put more than 4,000 satellites 
into orbit around Earth, building a new high-speed internet 
network. Phase one of Musk’s plan involves establishing a 
network of 800 low-orbit satellites to supply high-speed 
internet access to the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, 
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (sorry, Alaska). As the 
deployment of SpaceX’s satellites ramps up, global coverage 
should be possible. The satellites will camp out in Earth’s 
orbit anywhere from about 715 to 823 miles above the Earth’s 
surface, which puts them beyond the International Space 
Station but not nearly as far out as geostationary satellites.

Report survey said they would not do business with a company 
that had suffered a data breach. “This status-quo isn’t good 
enough anymore. As more and more of our lives migrate 
online, the cost and risk of a data breach is greatly increased 
and will lead to lost revenues and a lack of trust,” said report 
author Michael Kende.
The society offered several 
suggestions, including increasing 
transparency about the risk, 
incidence, and impact of data 
breaches; requiring companies 
to implement “best-practice 
standards” when it comes to 
data security; and holding 
organizations  more accountable 
for breaches.

average cost of a data breach is now 
$4 million, or $158 per lost record, 
up 29% and 15%, respectively,

Excuse Me, I Really
Need To Read This Text
A survey conducted periodically by Pew 
Research over the past decade shows that 
about one in five people in the U.S. now feel 
overwhelmed by the amount of information 
they have to deal with in their lives. This 
number has ticked up a couple of percentage 
points in the past few years, but it’s still 
well below the number who felt that way 
10 years ago. In 2006, Pew says more than 1 in 4 people were feeling anxious about so much data in 
their lives, a condition better known as “information overload.” While the percentage of anxious folks 
has decreased in 10 years, the percentage who say they are just fine with the amount of information 
coming their way has increased, moving up from 67% in 2006 to 77% today. As a group, the majority of 
us seem to be adapting just fine to the daily deluge of emails/texts/tweets/posts/calendar notifications/

It’s Either Time For A Workout, Or My Watch Is Broken
Smartwatches and fitness bands are two of the more recent digital products brought to market. They 
fall in the tech product category known as wearables. Gartner surveyed more than 9,500 people to 
learn what they think about both types of products. Analysts discovered that 10% of people have used 
a smartwatch, and nearly 19% have used a fitness band. Although most people buy smartwatches and 
fitness bands for themselves, more 
than one-fourth of smartwatches and 
one-third of fitness bands are given 
as gifts. The abandonment rate for 
both products is high, however, with 
29% of the watches and 30% of the 
bands abandoned by users. Reasons 
for abandonment include boredom, 
people not finding them useful, 
and breakage.

NCIX PC’s Avalanche 001 Wins Intel’s Extreme Rig Challenge
Advertisement
with clients to customize the build to 
their liking. 
Q
: This rig has a really interesting 
cooling system; are there two loops 
in there, or is it all one big loop?
LL
: It’s all one big loop. After you 
design a few loops you start to repeat 
certain runs because they work, they are 
functional, and they are efficient. I decided 
on a few flourishes in the loop design to set 
the Avalanche apart. An efficient run would 
have felt sterile. 
Q
: Have you benchmarked the system, 
and if so, can you share some 
numbers with us? 
LL
: Of course they can. I’ve already 
sold a few already. 
Q
: How much does it cost? 
LL
: A cool $10,000. You’re not just 
buying a bunch of components, 
you’re getting the expertise, attention 
to detail, and the knowledge to build a 
beautiful, powerful system. 
Q
: We noticed in the pictures on your 
site that there’s a graphic on the power 
supply that reads, “Avalanche 001/100” on 
it. Is this configuration a limited edition? 
LL
: More of a limited run for the 
Avalanche. We’re happy to work 
Q
: Can you talk about the parts you 
used in building the Avalanche 001 
and how you chose them? 
LL
: I figured most people would go 
with an SLI and PCIe SSD build, 
so I wanted to stand out in any way 
that I could. I picked LED RAM and I 
decided to watercool the SSD, as well, 
to add some extra flair. I was happy to 
find out that no one else had LED RAM 
or had attached a waterblock to the Intel 
750 SSD, which I feel set the Avalanche 
apart from the crowd. 
Q
: How were the system’s CPU and 
GPUs clocked?
LL
: I got the CPU to a nice, even 
4GHz and managed a 17 to 20% 
boost on the GPU clock, but GPU clock 
speeds never round out to a nice, even 
number for easy memorization.
Q
: How long did it take you to com-
plete the build? 
LL
: After waiting for parts, it took 
a solid month to put together. 
The mod work took up the most time. 
The loop plan was already in my head, 
but I had to make changes once it 
came time to build. No plan survives 
first contact. 
Q
: Can someone go to the NCIX PC 
site and order an Avalanche just like 
the one that won the Challenge?
NCIX PC System Designer and R&D Coordinator Leadthaniel Le designed, coordinated, and built (along with Jimmy, NCIX’s 
senior watercooling technician) the company’s entry in the recent Intel Extreme Rig Challenge, a no-holds-barred contest 
among seven high-end PC manufacturers to create the most extreme rig possible with the newest Intel Extreme Edition 
processor. We talked with him recently about the experience of competing on that level, and about his contest-winning 
creation, the Avalanche 001 (pictured on this month’s cover, right next to the Intel Extreme Rig Challenge trophy).
10 January2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

LL
: Oh yes, I benchmarked the system. 
You’ll just have to buy one to see the 
scores yourself.
Q
: In retrospect, is there anything 
you’d do differently with this build? 
LL
: Oh god yes. I’m never happy 
with a build. Even right to the 
end, I was tweaking the build and 
Francis was telling me, “Stop, we need to 
get this shipped.” Full whiteout interior 
paint, one set of radiator fans that are 
GPU-regulated, sequential lighting upon 
system power up, nickel-plated tubing, 
the list goes on.
Q
: What was the most challenging 
aspect of building Avalanche 001? 
LL

AORUS GA-Z270X-Gaming 5
a U.2 port, two NICs (the Killer E2500 
and Intel’s i219V), two USB 3.1 ports, 
and three PCIe x1 slots.
Many Z170 motherboards feature 
similar or identical connectivity, but such 
a setup generally requires several ports 
to share bandwidth. For example, we’ve 
reviewed several Z170 motherboards 
where you could connect two M.2 drives 
and a U.2 drive, but doing so shuts off 
all of the SATA ports and the bottom 
PCIe x16 slot. The GA-Z270X-Gaming 
5 allows you to fill up both of the two 
M.2 ports, the U.2 port, and four of the 
6Gbps SATA ports, while only losing the 
bottom PCIe x16 slot.
The Z270 chipset also arrives 
alongside Intel’s desktop Kaby Lake 
processors, and we tested the GA-
Z270X-Gaming 5 with Intel’s Core 
i7-7700K. Intel’s Skylake processors, 
such as a Core i7-6700K, can also 
work on this board, or any other Z270 
motherboard. The compatibility isn’t 
a huge point in Z270’s favor though, 
because many Z170 motherboards 
support desktop Kaby Lake chips via 
a firmware update. Another possible 
reason to jump to the Z270 chipset is 
cooling with blocks designed by EK 
Water Blocks or Bitspower.
The RGB lighting on the GA-
Z270X-Gaming 5 is dazzling. AORUS 
provides LEDs all around the board, 
and the illumination is customizable 
via the RGB Fusion utility. There are 
multiple lighting zones, each of which 
can have a different color and effect, 
including modes to pulse a single 
color, cycle through the entire 16.8 
million color spectrum, and sync with 
music or PC conditions, such as CPU 
temperature. The GA-Z270X-Gaming 5 
can also synchronize lighting with select 
GIGABYTE graphics cards and third-
party light kits. For the latter, the GA-
Z270X-Gaming 5 provides an RGBW 
light strip pin header to support a wider 
array of LED light kits.
The Z270 chipset is quite similar to 
the Z170 chipset. For right now, one 
of the notable differences is that Z270 
provides four additional PCIe 3.0 chipset 
lanes (up from 20 in Z170 to 24 in 
Z270) for more port flexibility. The GA-
Z270X-Gaming 5 takes advantage of the 
extra chipset lanes to deliver two M.2 
ports (type 2242, 2260, 2280, 22110),

hether you’re shopping for laundry 
detergent, ice cream, or a PC 
part, brand name is likely something 
that weighs into your decision. And 
while you probably spend more time 
researching a motherboard than a 
laundry detergent, it’s easier to find 
high-end products if you know the 
brand in question specializes in quality. 
AORUS is a premium gaming brand 
of GIGABYTE, and up until today, 
AORUS has been mostly known 
for notebooks. The GA-Z270X-
Gaming 5 is one of the first AORUS 
motherboards, and it also serves as our 
first look at the Z270 chipset. 
GIGABYTE isn’t going away as 
a motherboard brand, nor will its G1 
Gaming series, we’re told. The AORUS 
brand, similar to ASUS’ ROG brand, 
is aimed at gamers and is where you’ll 
find the most innovative, cutting-edge 
motherboard additions. The GA-Z270X-
Gaming 5, for instance, provides some 
interesting new twists for onboard 
lighting and fan controls. Higher-end 
AORUS motherboards, such as the GA-
Z270X-Gaming 7 or GA-Z270X-Gaming 
9, also feature built-in support for liquid

anywhere from 6 to 12.5%. The largest 
gains were seen in SiSoftware Sandra’s 
2016 tests, while improvements in 
Cinebench 15 and POV-Ray 3.7 were 
a modest 6.3% and 7%, respectively. 
Pairing the GA-Z270X-Gaming 5 with 
GIGABYTE’s GeForce GTX 1080 
Xtreme Gaming helped to produce 
healthy frame rates (all above 87fps) in 
our game tests.
 The AORUS brand is off to a good 
start with the GA-Z270X-Gaming 5. 
Bright RGB lighting throughout the board 
makes it incredibly easy to customize 
the look of your PC, and device support 
is everything we’ve come to expect 
from a GIGABYTE motherboard. We 
look forward to seeing other AORUS 
motherboards this year. ■

support for Intel’s Optane technology. 
Although not yet available, SSDs with 
Intel Optane memory are anticipated to 
use Intel’s XPoint technology to provide 
speedy storage.
Priced at $194.99, the GA-Z270X-
Gaming 5 falls on the lower spectrum 
of AORUS Z270 motherboards, 
yet it has almost all of the high-end 
performance capabilities of the more 
expensive boards. For example, you 
can install up to 64GB of DDR4-4000 
memory, as well as a 3-way CrossFire or 
2-way SLI graphics card configuration. 
The GA-Z270X-Gaming 5 also 
features Hybrid Fan pin headers that 
automatically detect the type of cooling 
device connected.
We tested the GA-Z270X-Gaming 5 
using both Intel’s Core i7-6700K and 
the Core i7-7700K. The benchmark 
results with the Core i7-6700K 
matched up with what we’ve seen from 
recently tested Z170 motherboards.

be afraid to put the VX500 on display. The 
drive’s slim 7mm height makes it a solid 
choice for notebooks, as well.
 Toshiba continues OCZ’s practice of 
relying on in-house components for 
its SSDs. The VX500 relies on Toshiba’s 
TC358790 storage controller, which has 
previously appeared in the company’s Q 
Series Pro and HG6 SSDs. We’re more 
excited about the presence of Toshiba MLC 
NAND. With so many manufacturers 
turning to TLC NAND as a means of 
cutting costs, it’s nice to see OCZ stick with 
MLC in the VX500. As a result, all of the 
VX500 drives boast impressive endurance 
ratings. The 1TB VX500 leads the way, 
promising 592TB TBW. The 512GB 
VX500 we tested has, expectedly, a TBW 
rating of 296TB. It’s no wonder OCZ offers 
a five-year warranty on these SSDs.
To test the 512GB VX500, we turned 
it loose on CrystalDiskMark and AS-SSD. 
The drive performed exactly as advertised, 
galloping through sequential workloads 
R
eports of 6Gbps SATA SSDs’ death 
have been greatly exaggerated. 
If Mark Twain could’ve been a power 
user, we like to think he would’ve 
admonished his fellow enthusiasts 
(ourselves included) over the countless 
prematurely penned obituaries for 
solid-state drives that use the 6Gbps 
SATA bus. After all, SATA is old but 
not extinct. In fact, we’d say that the 
arrival of PCIe SSDs has been a benefit 
for 6Gbps SATA drives, too. Now, 
SATA SSDs are extremely affordable; 
you can buy a hilarious amount of 
solid-state storage with only a little 
scratch. And guess what? It turns out 
6Gbps SATA SSDs are still pretty fast.
One terrific example is Toshiba’s OCZ 
VX500 family of SSDs. They take the 
baton from OCZ’s Vector 180 line; right 
away we noticed that the VX500 drives 
have received an external makeover. The 
metal housing looks terrific and has a slight 
shine to it; if aesthetics matter to you, don’t 
and delivering solid random read/write 
performance, particularly at high queue 
depths. The VX500 proved to us that 
6Gbps SATA SSDs aren’t going away 
anytime soon. ■

LEPA CHOPPER ADVANCE
model has a nearly all-white construction, 
while the other three options use a black 
frame with a “halo ring” (more on that in 
a moment) colored to match the LEDs. 
The CHOPPER ADVANCE fans offer 
30 lighting modes. The LEDs on the 
white model we tested were plenty bright, 
and the effects were brilliant. Be aware, 
though, that the lighting modes are not 
user-selectable. Instead, the CHOPPER 
ADVANCE cycles through all 30 and 
then starts over. Some might like the 
constantly changing nature of the fans’ 
LEDs, but we’d gladly pay a little more to 
have some control over the effects.
Although form is clearly important 
to LEPA, it’s equally apparent that 
function matters, as well. The CHOPPER 
ADVANCE is billed as having a modular 
design, and that’s no exaggeration. For 
starters, you can remove the fan rotor from 
the motor, which can make cleaning much 
easier. We needed a Herculean amount 
of force—so much that we were afraid of 
snapping the frame—to remove the rotor 
initially. Subsequent attempts required 
O
nce upon a time, manufacturers 
could occasionally get away with 
one-dimensional wares. Make a product 
with unparalleled performance, and most 
enthusiasts would forgive you if it was 
ugly as a toad. Conversely, power users 
buying a particular component based on 
its looks might be willing to accept less-
than-stellar performance.
We have a hard time believing that’s 
the case anymore. As markets become 
increasingly crowded and cutthroat, 
a company’s survival depends on doing 
everything well, because if you’re not 
willing to invest in making hardware that 
performs as awesome as it looks, you’d 
better believe the next guy is. LEPA clearly 
understands this, and its new CHOPPER 
ADVANCE case fans provide the proof.
Clearly, LEPA put the fans’ aesthetic 
front and center; they’re made to 
dazzle, relying on a thin PCB strip 
with LEDs attached to the fan rotor to 
accomplish this mission. LEPA outfits the 
CHOPPER ADVANCE with either blue, 
red, green, or white LEDs. The white 
considerably less pressure to remove the 
rotor. LEPA goes further, though, and lets 
you practically disassemble the fan entirely. 
Both the frame and the halo ring consist 
of two pieces, and separating all of them is 
simple work.
Speaking of work, the CHOPPER 
ADVANCE works hard for you. That 
halo ring we keep mentioning was 
designed to increase airflow by 30%, 
according to LEPA. As a PWM fan, the 
CHOPPER ADVANCE has a rotational 
speed range of 600 to 1,500rpm, good for 
a corresponding airflow range of 29.48 to 
70.38cfm.
For 20 bucks, the CHOPPER ADVANCE 
has plenty of power, and even more pizzazz. 
If you want your system to stand out, it’s a 
standout fan. ■

LEPA NEOllusion
negatively effecting the heatsink’s ability 
to efficiently move heat.
The NEOllusion includes one 120mm 
fan, and interestingly, the fan has no 
LEDs. LEPA tells us that, based on market 
research, the company found people would 
like to see LED lighting effects on different 
parts and components, rather than just 
the fan. The company is also working 
on different designs, though, and might 
include fan LED lighting effects in the 
future. In our opinion, RGB illumination 
from the fan might detract from the look 
of the NEOllusion. The LEDs on the top, 
bottom, and cover are plenty bright, as 
is, and more LEDs might make it garish. 
Points to LEPA for avoiding the “too much 
of a good thing” trap.
The 120mm provides a PWM range of 
600rpm to 1,800rpm and will generate 
airflow between 29.33cfm and 75.41cfm. 
Noise levels peak at 33dB(A). If that’s 
too loud for your build, you can install 
the included fan speed adapter and drop 
the fan’s PWM range to between 400rpm 
and 1,000rpm, which in turn lowers noise 
levels to 19dB(A) or less.
R
GB LEDs have forever changed the 
modding landscape. Where it was 
once time consuming to color match or 
compliment the parts of a system build, 
RGB LEDs built into fans and system 
components allow you to get creative 
with relative ease. CPU coolers, being 
one of the most visible parts of a system 
build, are an excellent candidate for RGB 
illumination. LEPA’s new NEOllusion air 
cooler is outfitted with RGB LEDs on the 
top and bottom of the heatsink, as well as 
in the small LEPA logo on the top cover. 
LEPA even includes a remote that lets you 
select one of 16 colors and apply lighting 
effects.
Outside of the CPU cooler’s RGB 
LEDs, the NEOllusion’s design is 
quite similar to LEPA’s LV12 air 
cooler. Both models feature four 6mm 
heatpipes that make direct contact with 
the processor, as well as a slim profile 
heatsink to avoid obstructing system 
memory. The NEOllusion also utilizes 
LEPA’s S.N.T.C. (Super Nano Thermal 
Conductive), which is a coating that helps 
the heatsink to resist oxidation without 
Temperatures under load were 
comparable to what we’ve seen with 
other slim air coolers when paired with 
Intel’s Core i7-6700K. In POV-Ray 
3.7, the NEOllusion kept the Core i7-
6700K to an average of 64.9 degrees 
Celsius with a maximum temp of 70 C. 
When pushing all threads with Prime95, 
average core temperatures raised to 78.7 
C and a maximum of 82 C. Average Idle 
temperatures were a mere 26.3 C.
RGB or no, air coolers are no stranger 
to fans with LEDs. But by installing the 
RGB LEDs above and below the vertically 
oriented cooler, rather than in the fan 
on the side of the cooler, LEPA ensured 
the NEOllusion looks like no other air 
cooler – at least, none that we’ve seen. In 
our test system, we particularly like how 
it illuminates the black metal plate on the 
GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme 
Gaming. The RGB capabilities, of course, 
make it easy to coordinate the lighting 
and refine your build’s color scheme.  ■

Antlion Audio ModMic 5 
does do with one unit what the MM4 
needed four SKUs to accomplish. Namely, 
the MM5 integrates omnidirectional and 
unidirectional mics into one capsule, along 
with a switch to toggle them. Further, 
Antlion bundles a removable mute 
switch by default now. It sits between the 
boom mic’s short cable and one of two 
extendable cables (1m and 2m lengths) 
Antlion includes, both with 3.5mm jacks. 
Anyone who games in varying environ-
ments knows why inclusion of both 
mic types is enticing. While the omni-
directional setting (studio mode) outputs 
more realistic audio and is best for quieter 
settings (a cozy man cave, for example), the 
unidirectional mic (noise-reduction mode) 
reduces ambient noise to lessen the impact 
of a noisy setting (think a large LAN party) 
on communication. 
The MM5 also includes stronger Kevlar-
reinforced cabling, a beefier steel spine for 
the boom’s flexible arm, cable wraps, and 
stronger magnets. Those magnets attach to 
clasps that connect the boom to headphones, 
W
hen we crossed paths with Antlion’s 
ModMic 4 back in January 2016, 
we walked away considerably impressed. 
A year later, our enthusiasm only extends 
for Antlion’s excellent new ModMic 5. 
That’s primarily due to numerous user-
requested enhancements Antlion made to 
ultimately craft a pricier ($20 extra) but 
more versatile and durable model. 
For the uninitiated, the ModMic 
is a detachable boom mic that uses a 
simple but effective magnetic system 
to attach to any headphones, including 
high-end, expensive cans you might 
already own or are eying but that lack 
a mic. By adding mic functionality, 
the ModMic saves you from having to 
buy a separate gaming headset or settle 
for the typically inferior audio quality 
gaming headsets produce compared to 
even quality midrange headphones.
So what constitutes the MM5’s higher 
price? Not better mic quality actually, as 
even Antlion notes there’s no difference 
over the MM4 here. The MM5, however, 
and setup couldn’t be easier. Just attach 
the 3M adhesive-backed base clasp to the 
headphones and the top magnetic clasp 
on the boom arm to this. When finished, 
just separate the magnets. I used Superlux 
HD668B semi-open headphones, and the 
base magnet connected firmly to the earcup’s 
mesh covering just as Antlion promised. 
(USB and Y adapters for Mac, console, 
and mobile device use are available from 
Antlion, as well.) 
Where clarity, noise reduction, and 
other qualities desirable in a mic are 
concerned, the MM5 takes a long step 
past most mics included with gaming 
headsets and earbuds I’ve used in recent 
years. Recordings, chats, in-game 
communication, and calls were exceedingly 
clear and strong. In unidirectional mode, 
those I communicated with reported 
similar stellar results. Overall, we’re not 
talking professional studio-level mic 
quality, but the MM5 isn’t that far off. ■

Alphacool Eisbaer 360
featuring a GPU waterblock and radiator. 
The Eisbaer 360’s pump and radiator 
feature standard G1/4 fittings, so you can 
add thicker hoses or hard tubing down 
the road if you want a truly custom look. 
Alphacool provides a fill port on top of the 
pump to easily refill or add coolant when 
expanding the loop.
Alphacool’s background is primarily 
in custom liquid-cooling parts, and the 
company sells its own fittings, pumps, 
radiators, reservoirs, and waterblocks, 
among other cooling accessories. The 
Eisbaer 360 is a collection of Alphacool’s 
top-end components. For instance, the 
360mm radiator is based on Alphacool’s 
NexXxos ST30 360. The radiator’s pure 
copper construction helps it outperform the 
aluminum radiators so common in closed-
loop coolers. The built-in pump is similar in 
design to Alphacool’s DC-LT Ceramic Ultra 
Low Noise pump. PWM control allows 
for pump power as low as 7V, for quiet 
T
he majority of AIO CPU liquid 
coolers are closed loops that have been 
factory filled and sealed, so you’ll never 
need to perform maintenance. An AIO’s 
preassembled design also makes it much 
easier to install than the disparate pieces of 
a custom water loop, but the factory seal 
prevents you from expanding the loop. The 
Alphacool Eisbaer 360 is a different breed of 
AIO liquid cooler. It has all the traditional 
benefits of a preassembled closed-loop kit, 
and Alphacool adds a quick disconnect 
fitting so you can expand the loop without 
having to drain the system or take it apart.
Alphacool provides a couple of ways 
to make the Eisbaer 360 work with other 
liquid-cooling parts. The quick disconnect 
built into the tubing is compatible with 
Alphacool’s lineup of quick-release 
connectors, which smartly include adapters 
for standard G1/4 fittings. The Eisbaer’s 
quick disconnect is also compatible with 
Alphacool’s Eiswolf GPX-Pro AIO kits 
operation, and a maximum of 12V that 
delivers a pump speed of 2,600rpm.
To dissipate heat from the 360mm 
radiator, Alphacool provides three of its 
120mm Eiswind fans that feature a high 
static pressure (up to 1.66mm/H20). Similar 
to the pump, the 120mm fans are PWM 
controlled with a range of 550 to 1,700 rpm. 
Alphacool includes a three-way splitter so 
you can connect all three fans to a single fan 
header. The system was nearly silent during 
idle, but fan noise is definitely audible when 
all three fans are running at 1,700rpm. 
Our testing results show that the Eisbaer 
360 is well equipped to help you reach peak 
overclocks. After running Prime95’s Small 
FFT torture test for 10 minutes, Intel’s Core 
i7-6700K maxed out at only 76 degrees 
Celsius, while average temperatures during 
the test reached 72.1 C. We ran the same 
test on an Intel Core i7-7700K with average 
and maximum temperatures reaching 73.4 C 
and 78 C, respectively. We also ran POV-Ray 
3.7 on both Intel chips for 10 minutes, with 
maximum temperatures hitting 64 C (Core 
i7-6700K) and 66 C (Core i7-7700K).
The ability to easily upgrade parts is one of 
the reasons we love PCs, and the Eisbaer 360 
is much more flexible than a conventional 
AIO liquid cooler. If you eventually want 
to liquid-cool your GPU but aren’t ready to 
upgrade right now or just want the option 
to expand the cooling loop down the line, 
the Eisbaer 360 is ready-made for the job. 
In the meantime, the Eisbaer 360’s high-
quality liquid-cooling components provide 
enthusiast-grade CPU cooling. ■

Intel Core i7-7700K
slightly. Intel is calling it 14PLUS, and 
highlights of the tweaked process include a 
higher fin height and larger pitch, which give 
the transistors more breathing room, and as 
a result, Kaby Lake chips are seeing a 12% 
bump in performance due to the higher 
clocks. On the downside, because we’re not 
getting a process shrink, this chip has the same 
TDP as the Skylake family’s flagship Core i7-
6700K, 91 watts. 
Other features include 8MB of 
Intel Smart Cache, an 8GTps DMI 3.0 
link between the processor and the Intel 
Platform Controller Hub, a dual-channel 
memory controller with a peak bandwidth 
of 38.4GBps, and support for up to 16 
PCIe 3.0 lanes (and access to another 24 
from the chipset).
This is, of course, a K Series processor 
equipped with an unlocked multiplier. Paired 
with a Z270 motherboard (or a compatible 
BIOS-updated Z170 motherboard), you can 
nudge the processor’s operating frequency 
ever higher for even better performance. We 
managed to overclock the Core i7-7700K to 
5GHz using an aftermarket air cooler, which 
means you should be able to do better with 
liquid or something more exotic. 
The on-die graphics engine has also 
received a number of tweaks for Kaby Lake. 
The Intel HD Graphics 630 has a dynamic 
clock of up to 1,150MHz, and the revamped 
media engine features hardware acceleration 
for 4K VP9 and HEVC 10-bit encoding and 
decoding. This processor supports Netflix 
4K UHD content and is capable of multi-
streaming HD and Ultra HD video content. 
The performance gap between Skylake 
and Kaby Lake is rather narrow, but if 
you’re still running a 22nm processor or 
older, this chip should be on the top of 
your upgrade wish list. ■

A
new year has just begun, and we finally 
have a new LGA1151 CPU from 
Intel primed to take on the mantle of best 
enthusiast processor this side of $1,000. 
Although Intel gave us an early glimpse of 
Kaby Lake’s mobile chops back in August, 
the Core i7-7700K is the desktop chip we’ve 
been waiting for. It’s going to be a good year. 
From a design and architecture 
standpoint, there’s not a lot of revolutionary 
stuff under the IHS of the Core i7-7700K. 
It’s a quad-core processor with Hyper-
Threading enabled, letting it handle up to 
eight concurrent threads at a time. It has a 
4.2GHz core clock, 200MHz faster than its 
Skylake counterpart, and a Turbo Boost 2.0 
frequency of up to 4.5GHz, or 300MHz 
faster than the Core i7-6700K’s limit. 
These faster clocks and Kaby Lake’s Speed 
Shift v2 technology, which lets it change 
clock speeds three times as quickly as Skylake, 
are the main attractions. But unless you’ve 
been living under a rock for the past year or 
so, you already know that this is still a 14nm 
process-based chip, the third 14nm processor 
family Intel has launched since Broadwell. 
Say “goodbye” to Intel’s Tick-Tock 
model and say “hello” to the PAO, (Process-
Architecture-Optimization) release scheme. 
Kaby Lake is the optimization phase of this 
cycle, which means the process has evolved

GIGABYTE GeForce 
GTX 1050 G1 Gaming 2G
XTREME Engine Utility, and you have 
16.8 million colors to choose from. 
The card is the highest-clocked version of 
the GTX 1050 available from GIGABYTE, 
and even the GTX 1050 Ti doesn’t get such 
impressive clocks, although the latter card’s 
128 more CUDA Cores and larger frame 
buffer more than make up the difference. 
The reference design of the GTX 1050 
is saddled with a 1,354MHz base and 
1,455MHz boost clock, but GIGABYTE 
used its GPU Gauntlet Sorting methodology 
to find chips capable of running reliably with 
a 1,442MHz base clock and 1,556MHz 
boost clock. As with all of our recent 
GIGABYTE graphics card reviews, we are 
reporting the OC Mode numbers, which 
you can unlock using the firm’s XTREME 
Engine Utility.
Who says overclocking can’t come cheap 
in 2016 (and 2017)? GIGABYTE equipped 
this card with a 4 + 1 phase VRM, that’s 
an extra phase compared to the reference 
design, which will let you push this card 
even harder to eke out a few more frames 
per second in modern games. High quality 
metal chokes and solid state capacitors, as 
well as a 2-ounce copper PCB all help ensure 
this card performs reliably for a long time. 
As you can see from the benchmark 
scores, the GTX 1080 G1 Gaming 2GD 
feels right at home at 1,920 X 1,080, but it 
even manages to post playable framerates 
at 1440p. Take another look at the price on 
this thing. Yeah, we’re impressed.  ■

eports of the death of the entry-level 
graphics card have been greatly 
exaggerated. It’s true, AMD and Intel have 
made gaming without a discrete graphics 
card a slightly less embarrassing endeavor, 
but the GIGABYTE GTX 1050 shows that 
there’s still a wide performance gulf between 
it and the fastest Intel HD Graphics inside 
Sky Lake processors and AMD APU-
based GCN gen three R7 graphics. For less 
than $150, it’s hard to clear the bar that 
GIGABYTE has set with this card. 
The GTX 1050 G1 Gaming 2G we 
tested features a fairly compact design. 
Although it is still a two-slot card, it 
measures 8-inches from the bracket to the 
edge of the black and orange plastic heatsink 
shroud. There’s an aluminum backplate 
anodized black with orange painted accents. 
This card sports a WINDFORCE 2X 
cooler, which consists of a pair of 90mm 
fans positioned above an aluminum fin 
and copper heatpipe heatsink. The bulk of 
the heatsink is centered over the GPU and 
the 2GB worth of memory, with the two 
composite heatpipes converging over the top 
of the GPU to maximize heat dissipation. 
These heatpipes are multilayered, with 
a sintered copper inner core that allows a 
phase-transitioning liquid to circulate and 
rapidly move heat away from the hottest 
parts of the pipes. A smaller section of the 
heatsink also makes contact with the VRM.
The top edge of the card features an 
RGB LED backlit GIGABYTE logo and 
Fan Stop indicator. You can customize the 
colors and effects of these lights using the

Aerocool LS-5200
includes a steel power supply shroud, 
which savvy builders know serves two 
purposes: It creates a separate cooling 
zone for the PSU, and it helps keep 
the inside of your case looking nice 
and tidy.
Atop the PSU shroud, you’ll find 
two 2.5-inch drive mounting trays that 
you can remove with a thumbscrew 
when it’s time to install SSDs or hard 
drives; there’s also a dual-bay 3.5-inch 
drive cage located behind the power 
supply shroud toward the front end. 
Add all of those to the two vertical 
2.5-inch drive mounts attached to the 
back of the motherboard tray, and you 
can load this case up with as many as 
six drives.
The LS-5200’s motherboard tray 
accepts microATX, Mini-ITX, and 
ATX boards, and the case will hold 
graphics cards up to 13.6 inches long 
with fans installed behind the front 
T
he latest case to arrive from 
Aerocool HQ is the LS-5200, 
a black steel and plastic mid-tower 
with an acrylic left side-panel window 
and a roomy interior designed to 
accommodate a full-blown liquid-
cooling system. The “LS” in “LS-
5200” stands for “Liquid Solution,” 
so it’s little surprise going in that the 
case will accept installation of either 
a 280mm or 360mm radiator behind 
the front panel and either a 240mm 
or 280mm radiator beneath the top 
panel. Additionally, the front and top 
panels consist largely of black steel 
mesh, and each is equipped with a thin 
foam dust filter. 
The upshot of all this is that you 
can pack a lot of high-end PC gear 
inside this case and easily keep it all 
very cool. Toward that end, Aerocool 
built in two fan control switches at 
the top of the front panel and also 
panel (14.6 inches without). Full-sized 
power supplies and CPU air coolers 
are of course no problem, so there are 
very few if any limits on what kind of 
system you can build inside.
The outside of the case has a simple 
yet angular style that makes it a nice fit 
for a gaming rig or just about any kind 
of build; Aerocool gives it a few design 
notes that remind us of the excellent 
P7-C1, yet it rings in at just $89.99, 
proving once again that Aerocool is 
one of the best companies around at 
delivering cool aesthetics and the latest 
design features at affordable prices. ■

CPU’s Best Of 2016 
We Select Our Favorite Products From The Year 
In 13 Categories
Honorable Mentions: CaseLabs Bullet 
BH4, Deepcool Gamer Storm Genome
Best CPU: Intel Core i7-6950X
If early indications are accurate, 2017 
may be a much more competitive year 
in the field of desktop CPUs than 2016 
was, but there were still some pretty cool 
processor launches in the year we just left 
behind. The biggest, baddest CPU on 
the block—by a huge margin—was the 
flagship of Intel’s Broadwell-E family of 
chips, the Core i7-6950X.
The 6950X is a 10-core, 20-thread 
beast with a stock clock speed of 3GHz, 
but Intel’s Turbo Boost 3.0 technology 
can crank that up to 3.5GHz as needed, 
and Turbo Boost Max can pick specific 
cores based on perf needs and jack them 
up even higher, all the way to 4GHz. 
a general rule, they look great, they’re 
easy to work with, and they come with 
all of the latest case design innovations, 
often well before you’ll see those things 
in other stock case offerings. They are 
also incredibly well made, and best of 
all, they all ring up at right around 
$100 or less. 
The Define C retails for less than $90 
and improves on the amazing Define S 
in a couple significant ways: It’s a hair 
smaller, while still accommodating a 
similar complement of hardware, and it 
comes with a power supply shroud that 
makes it even easier to keep the interior 
of your system squared away. We saw 
quite a few great cases in 2016, but at 
the end of the day, it’s hard to beat the 
Define C for quality, utility, and value.

W
e review a great many PC tech 
products throughout the course of 
a year, and sometimes as we move on to 
the next product, and the next one, and 
the next one, it’s easy to forget how great 
some of them really were. So this holiday 
season, the staff here at CPU decided to 
take a moment as one year slips away and 
another arrives to recognize some of the 
cool stuff we had come through our offices 
in 2016. We chose our favorite products 
from each of 13 categories; below you’ll 
find out what they were and why we chose 
them, as well as a couple products from 
each category that we thought merited 
Honorable Mention recognition.
Best Case: Fractal Design Define C
We’ve been fans of Fractal Design’s 
Define-series cases for several years; as 
24 January2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

the lowest of which was a 57fps in The 
Witcher 3 with settings turned way up. 
It’s ready and willing to game at 4K, and 
it’s VR-ready, as well.
But the Avalanche Mini doesn’t 
just run games at silky smooth 
frame rates without the slightest 
hitch; it also looks like a showpiece. 
The immaculate interior is lit by 
a soft LED glow that shows off its 
custom hard tube cooling loop (you 
pick the color via remote control), 
and the Corsair Carbide Series Air 
240 (in white, of course) is a great 
showcase for all that hardware. And 
we can’t forget that the Mini comes 
with AVA’s Silver Warranty Package, 
a three-year limited parts and labor 
warranty that includes lifetime tech 
support. Game, set, and match.

Best Graphics Card: SAPPHIRE 
NITRO+ Radeon RX 480 8GB
There were a ton of great new 
graphics cards this year, and although 
it’s not the fastest or even the most 
innovative, we love the NITRO+ 480 
for pushing the price/performance 
Here’s what really made up our 
minds, though: In our tests, a Core i7-
6950X cooled by the MasterLiquid Pro 
240 never got hotter than 48.23 degrees 
Celsius, and that’s the temp we got while 
running Prime95’s small FFTs torture 
test; POV-Ray 3.7’s max CPU test 
only raised the mercury to 43 C. Lots 
of products make claims about superior 
cooling, but this one delivers, and we 
have the numbers to prove it. Cooler 
Master gave it an MSRP of $119.99, 
which is right in line with the market, 
too, so we gave it the CPU Cutting Edge 
Award for innovative design. (www.

Best Desktop PC: AVADirect 
Avalanche Mini
Put simply, the Avalanche Mini is a 
microATX Death Star. Of course, like 
most AVADirect PCs, you can order it 
in a variety of configurations, but our 
review unit was packing an Intel Core 
i7-6700K (overclocked to 4.8GHz), 
ASUS’ Z170-DELUXE mobo, and an 
EVGA GeForce GTX TITAN X, and it 
produced amazing benchmark results, 
This 14nm marvel packs 3.2 billion Tri-
Gate transistors and 24MB of on-die 
Intel Smart Cache; it also has a TDP of 
140 watts, which is pretty impressive, all 
things considered. The chip provides 40 
PCIe lanes, and supports quad-channel 
DDR4 memory via the X99 chipset—up 
to a staggering 128GB of it. Benchmarks 
told the tale: The Core i7-6950X was far 
and away the highest-performing CPU 
released in 2016, and that gets it the nod 
in our list of favorites. (www.intel.com)
Honorable Mentions: AMD Athlon 
X4 845, Intel Core i5-6600K
Best CPU Cooler: Cooler Master 
MasterLiquid Pro 240
All-in-one liquid CPU coolers are 
largely the default choice for DIY builders 
who aren’t quite ready to commit to the 
complexity and expense of a custom 
cooling system, and the MasterLiquid 
Pro 240 from Cooler Master stood head 
and shoulders above similarly priced 
competitors in 2016. According to the 
manufacturer, the MasterLiquid Pro 240 
has a dramatically redesigned waterblock 
with 657% more surface area, which 
equals more effective heat dissipation, 
as well as a radiator that uses square 
aluminum cooling fins that maximize 
contact with the liquid channels.

Best Laptop PC: MSI GE72VR 
APACHE PRO
Our review from October says it all: 
“Notebooks with GeForce GTX 10 
Series cards are now the ultimate power 
in the mobile gaming universe.” This 
17.3-inch beauty is equipped with a 
GTX 1060 with 1,280 CUDA cores 
and 6GB of 8,000MHz GDDR5 
memory, and it is ready and willing 
to run the latest games at blistering 
frame rates given the GE72VR’s 1,920 
x 1,080 native resolution. And speaking 
of the display panel beneath this 
notebook’s lid, MSI builds in an IPS 
screen and its proprietary True Color 
Technology, which gives you easy access 
to preset viewing modes. 
The GE72VR produced some very 
playable frame rates at 1080p, including 
60fps in Metro: Last Light and in 
Best Keyboard: Cooler Master 
MasterKeys Pro L
We reviewed the MasterKeys Pro 
S, which is the same keyboard but 
without the numpad the Pro L has in the 
customary position to the right of its main 
key array. We loved it, but we prefer the 
full-sized version; we are big fans of the 
numpad. We approve of the MasterKeys 
Pro boards’ minimalist design, bright 
LEDs, and on-the-fly macros. We also 
like the way you can cycle through LED 
backlight modes using the FN key.

cooling solution combines with its 
NITRO Boost overclock to push AMD’s 
Polaris GPU with its GCN architecture 
from its stock core speed 1,120MHz 
(1,266MHz Boost mode) all the way up 
to 1,342MHz with the flip of a switch 
on the top of the card—this will be the 
easiest overclock you’ve ever done.
The NITRO+ also serves up RGB

In 2016, the X99 chipset and 
Broadwell-E processors ruled the 
performance landscape in the high-end 
PC world, and GIGABYTE’s GA-X99-
Ultra Gaming board is the finest blend 
of features, performance, aesthetics,

market. Connectivity options include 
M.2, U.2, SATA Express, and USB 
3.1 Type-C, among others. Its eight 
DIMM slots support up to 128GB of 
quad-channel DDR4 memory, and its 
Ultra Durable construction and other 
power management features make it a 
capable overclocker.
Want to run SLI? CrossFire? No 
problem, the X99-Ultra Gaming is ready 
and waiting. It performed admirably in 
our testing, has a great-looking red and 
white color scheme and customizable

State-Of-The-Art 
Standards 
Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording
magnetic recording technology, there’s a 
real need for HAMR to succeed.
Worn Out Tools
Modern HDDs are built using PMR 
(Perpendicular Magnetic Recording) or 
SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording). 
PMR was commercially introduced in 
2005 and has been the dominant technology 
for data recording on HDDs ever since. 
Before PMR, HDDs used longitudinal 
magnetic recording where each data bit 
was aligned horizontally and parallel to the 
gigabyte. By comparison, even bottom-
barrel SATA SSDs generally cost around 40 
cents per gigabyte.
HDD manufacturers are looking for 
ways to improve data storage density to 
keep pace with the incredible jumps in 
SSD technology. HAMR (heat-assisted 
magnetic recording) is one of the long-
awaited breakthroughs that would enable 
HDD makers to dramatically increase 
drive capacity, but there are numerous 
technical issues that have held it back. 
As HDDs reach the limits of current 
H
ard drives don’t get much love these 
days. Spinning-platter technology 
lives in the slow lane, and continuous 
improvements to NAND-based storage 
make it unlikely enthusiasts will use HDDs 
where performance is critical. But just 
because HDDs are slow doesn’t mean they 
are irrelevant. For pure mass storage, such 
as space-hogging personal image and video 
collections, it’s currently tough to beat the 
price-to-capacity of modern HDDs. We 
found that many 6TB and 8TB drives, 
for example, come in under 4 cents per

right. “Try to take a lubricant, heat it up 
in a very short time to more than 600 
degrees Celsius, and cool it down in a few 
nano-seconds, and you see why you have 
a problem with the lubricant,” says Talke. 
“The same can be said for the magnetic 
coating, the head material, the laser path, 
the materials in the transducer, etc.”
HAMR would likely also need to 
work in coordination with current 
HDD technologies, such as PMR 
or SMR, to further improve storage 
density. Therefore, it’s regrettable that 
the dense design of current HDDs can 
further complicate the use of HAMR. 
“The present PMR technology is already 
difficult since you have a head/disk 
interface at 1nm,” says Talke. “Add PMR 
to the high and transient temperatures 
of HAMR, due to laser heating the 
material, and you see why HAMR is a 
very difficult technology.”
HAMR hard drives will require some 
advanced heads that can apply both 
heat and a magnetic field one bit at a 
time. A near-field optical transducer is 
typically used to focus the laser beam 
onto the recording media. Researchers 
away from longitudinal magnetic recording 
(to PMR) more than 10 years ago.
HAMR Brings The Heat
HAMR overcomes the superparamagnetic 
effect by using more resistant recording 
media and heating it during the writing 
process. Coercivity, which is the resistance 
of material to magnetic change, drops 
when media is heated to the Curie point 
(the temperature where a material loses its 
permanent magnetic properties). “The bit 
cell in HAMR can be made smaller since 
the recording media in HAMR has higher 
coercivity than PMR media,” says Talke. 
“This allows smaller bits and, therefore, 
higher density.”
A special laser on the HDD’s write head 
brings a bit’s magnetic grains close to, or 
beyond (depending on the design) the Curie 
point, and then the head applies the new 
magnetic field. The bit’s magnetic direction 
will “freeze” as the grains cool down. The 
whole process of heating, magnetizing, and 
cooling the magnetic bits can take place at 
the same speed as current HDD technology. 
If you think the HAMR process 
sounds like it’s hard to achieve, you’d be 
spinning platter. PMR stands data bit regions 
on end in a hard disk’s magnetic recording 
layer. The adjacent bits of PMR attract, 
instead of repel as in a longitudinal media, 
which helps to create more thermally stable 
magnetic bits. But after a decade at the top, 
HDD makers are beginning to reach the 
limits of what PMR can achieve.
Some of today’s highest-capacity 
HDDs use SMR (Shingled Magnetic 
Recording), which allows for more 
narrow tracks to be written than PMR 
technology. SMR increases areal density 
by letting tracks overlap each other, like 
the shingles on a roof. When new data is 
written, the track is trimmed to create the 
shingled pattern. All the data can be read 
off of the trimmed section, so there aren’t 
compromises to reliability. 
There’s a downside to SMR technology, 
though, because the drives aren’t typically as 
fast as PMR HDDs. When data in a SMR 
HDD must be re-written, SMR must write 
the requested data, as well as the surrounding 
tracks. SMR technology groups the shingled 
tracks into bands, so the entire drive wouldn’t 
need to be rewritten. Impressively, SMR 
has helped HDD makers to reach 10TB of 
capacity in a single 3.5-inch drive.
Based on these methods, it’s challenging 
for HDD makers to evolve areal density, or 
the number of bits that can be stored on a 
given surface area, beyond 1.5Tbpsi (terabits 
per square inch). Hard drive manufacturers 
have already reached the 1Tbpsi barrier with 
2.5-inch drives. “It is very difficult to increase 
the recording density of present hard disk 
drives since the flying height is as small as 
it can be made, the track density is near its 
maximum, and so is the linear density,” says 
Frank Talke, professor, mechanical aerospace 
engineering, at the Center For Memory And 
Recording Research.
Data stability is a big reason why 
current PMR and SMR technology 
won’t work at tighter densities. At some 
point, the bits and magnetic grains 
become so tiny that, under the influence 
of temperature, magnetized bits can 
destabilize, resulting in file corruption. 
This scientific phenomenon is known as 
the superparamagnetic effect, and it’s one 
of the reasons that HDD makers moved

is that HAMR technology have been 
in development for a long time. Back 
in 2001, the U.S. National Institute 
of Standards and Technology awarded 
a research grant worth more than $21 
have been investigating the effect of 
HAMR on various materials for years, 
as there are several optical and thermal 
tradeoffs researchers have to consider. 
For example, HAMR must balance 
the head’s laser power with the write 
current, which leads to compromises 
with read/write performance and 
reliability. Gold is one of the 
common head materials for near-field 
transducers, because gold offers good 
optical quality and chemical inertness.
For all the changes that HAMR 
makes to the writing process, reading 
HAMR-recorded data works no 
differently than with current hard drive 
tech. The HDD’s head moves over the 
magnetic fields on the platter and can 
detect the polarity of the magnetic 
particles. Data is stored in an orderly 
pattern and the HDD will move the 
head to the exact location of needed 
files when your PC requests them.

Might Guess

the engineering challenges of HAMR 
are immense. Maybe more troublesome

44 zettabytes (a zettabyte is a trillion 
gigabytes) of data by 2020, up from 
less than 10 zettabytes in 2015. And by 
2025, IDC believes the digital universe 
could be as large as 180 zettabytes. The 
Internet of Things and connected devices 
are expected to be a huge contributor to 
the digital universe. For instance, IDC 
expects the number of connected devices 
to jump from 20 billion today to 30 
billion in 2020 and 80 billion in 2025.
It’s not just machines that are 
generating more data. A recent 
report from Deloitte predicates that 
2.5 trillion photos will be shared 
or stored online in 2016, and all of 
those photos, as well as videos and 
other personal file collections need 
to be stored somewhere. Increasing 
media quality, such as 4K video and 
20MP images, also take up much more 
storage space than older multimedia. 
Digital data generated from business 
isn’t slowing down, either. Metadata 
from emails and contacts, video 
surveillance, and file size increases 
meet on the Stanford campus for the 
27th Magnetic Recording Conference. 
HAMR technology was a popular topic 
and there were several presentations 
about specific HAMR optimizations 
and fixes. Just some of the discussions 
included high track pitch capabilities for 
HAMR recording, areal density impacts 
of transition curvature, thermal gradient 
measurements, and optimizing the 
optical and thermal design. 
We asked both Seagate and WD if 
they had any plans to release HAMR 
drives in the near future. Seagate 
told us that they remain on track 
to ship in volume in 2018.  WD said 
they were also committed to making 
HAMR HDDs. 
Why HAMR Development Is Critical
Demand for storage is being driven 
by huge potential increases in digital 
data creation. Market research firm 
IDC (International Data Corporation) 
estimates that the digital universe, which 
is defined by the data we create, will be 
At various times in the last 10 years, 
HDD companies have shown off demos 
of HAMR-based HDDs, which have 
further fueled the belief that huge-
capacity hard drives are right around 
the corner. In 2013, for example, 
Seagate showed off HAMR technology 
at CEATEC, while WD demonstrated 
HAMR technology at the 2013 China 
International Forum on Advanced 
Materials and Commercialization. The 
demonstrations over the years show 
that researchers have been able to create 
drives that function, though it’s anyone’s 
guess as to how reliable they were.
The HDD industry has continually 
pushed back dates for when consumers 
can expect to see HAMR technology in 
hard drives. “HAMR drives have been 
predicted to come out very shortly for 
at least four or five years,” says Talke. 
“It has not yet happened because the 
technology is very difficult.” 
The current outlook on HAMR isn’t 
all doom and gloom. Last August, a 
group of researchers and HDD experts

HDMR isn’t expected to appear on 
HDDs in the near future. In a 2015 
Seagate forecast, for example, the 
company projects 2025 for initial HDMR 
product integration.
HDD vs. SSD
HAMR technology looks to be the 
best path to success for HDDs. Talke 
says, “The potential of HAMR is 
great and it would be wonderful if 
the technical issues could be solved 
soon.” Of course, HDDs are no longer 
the only way to pack a single drive 
with high-capacity storage. In August, 
Seagate demoed a 60TB SSD designed 
for enterprises, and if released, the 
SSD would be four times the storage 
capacity of the next highest-capacity 
SSD available. If SSD makers—which 
now include the HDD giants WD and 
Seagate—find a way to cost-efficiently 
produce SSDs anywhere near 60TB 
capacities, the magnetic spinning 
platter might fall into disuse. HAMR, 
it seems, may be the only way forward 
for HDDs. ■
a half petabyte of storage capacity, while 
the same server with 20TB HDDs could 
provide 1.2 petabytes.
HAMR To HDMR
Should HDD manufacturers succeed 
with HAMR technology, HDMR 
(Heated Dot Magnetic Recording) is 
the next reasonable step to improve 
hard drive areal density. It’s been 
theorized that HDMR could produce 
areal density beyond 10Tbpsi. HDMR 
progresses beyond HAMR by using 
BPM (bit-patterned media) to create 
a row of uniformly spaced magnetic 
bits set inside a non-magnetic material. 
The bits are sometimes referred to as 
islands, and the isolated design helps 
to improve the magnetic and thermal 
stability of each bit.
BPM allows for much denser bits 
than existing HDD technologies. Using 
BPM, nanolithography technology 
patterns bits into magnetic islands 
as small as 5nm. Similar to HAMR, 
HDMR uses a laser to heat each island 
beyond the Curie temperature.
further add to the need for high-
capacity storage.
SSDs will continue to work alongside 
the HDD in enterprises and data 
centers to help organizations meet the 
demand, but the cost of SSDs will likely 
remain a barrier to adoption, unless 
NAND or SSD makers can find a way 
to lower prices. If HAMR or another 
HDD technology were to make its way 
onto the market, storage organizations 
might be able to more cost-effectively 
scale with storage demands.
Sure, data centers could just increase 
the number or servers—or put more 
drives in a storage system—but floor 
space in a data center is extremely 
valuable. Data centers also have to 
consider how additional servers would 
affect a server room’s power and cooling. 
Higher-capacity HDDs might allow 
a data center or enterprise to increase 
capacity without the need to also 
increase server footprint or renovating 
the server floor for additional power and 
cooling. Consider that a 60-drive server 
with 8TB HDDs would offer just under

Fallout Vault 111 
Decontamination Pod
“This system was built for someone to enjoy it and show

“My goal was to produce a clean, recognizable piece that 
could travel and be easily maintained when it got to its new 
home. EVGA also had a special-edition graphics card that 
they were releasing for the new game; I think I might have 
been one of the first people to see and use this special card.”

“I figured that the creation of this mod was going to 
be heavier on the aesthetics than on the modding of the

was cutting the side panel for the decontamination pod 
window. This had to match the look that was in the game to 
make it recognizable.”
As you can see, it’s very recognizable. We half expected to

Of course, Carel’s modesty neglects to point out that he 
also constructed a super-cool replica of Vault 111’s outer 
vault door on the opposite side from the decontamination 
pod door. Carel says he spent about 40 to 50 hours 
altogether on this project. He used 1/8-inch-thick foam

require an introduction to this month’s Mad Reader 
Mod winner, Dewayne “Americanfreak” Carel, CEO 
and editor-in-chief of Modders-Inc, so we’ll just get right 
to his latest MRM-winning creation: Fallout Vault 111 
Decontamination Pod. With a name this descriptive, it’s 
not hard to figure out where Carel’s inspiration came from; 
if you haven’t been living in a cave the past year, you know 
that Vault 111 is the starting point for Fallout 4, one of the 
biggest videogame releases of 2015.
“When doing a theme mod, I look throughout the game, 
movie, or whatever the theme is taken from and I find a few 
things that I believe will grab your attention and that can be 
molded into the shape of the case,” Carel says. “If you pick 
something that is normally round and you try to make it fit 
a box shape, well, it is just not going to look good.”
No problem here; despite the fact that the big, rolling 
vault doors themselves are round, this mod’s namesake, the 
Decontamination Pod doors are rectangular, and both sides 
of this mod turned out great regardless of shape.

intended to give it away as part of a contest.

board to create the texture and the various levels on his side 
panel vault door.
“I had a vision in my head of how I wanted this mod to 
look, and I was able to achieve that 100%,” he says. “This 
rarely happens, as there is always something along the way 
that you have to change to make it fit or it just didn’t come 
out right. So when it works out this way, I bask a little in the 
glow of my accomplishment.”
Open The Vault
The Fallout Vault 111 Decontamination Pod does a decent 
job of keeping its components from being contaminated; 
they include an Intel Core i5-6600K, an ASUS Z170-A 
motherboard, 16GB of HyperX Fury DDR4-2133 memory, 
an EVGA GeForce GTX 970 Fallout Edition graphics card 
(check out the fly Vault Boy art on the backplate!), a Corsair 
AX860 power supply, and an Intel SSD 535 Series 240GB 
drive. Carel started the project with a Phanteks Enthoo Pro 
case, and cools the rig with Swiftech’s H220 X2 all-in-one 
liquid CPU cooler.
Carel mysteriously tells us that he has “one mod that I pull 
out and work on every once in a while,” but declined to give

Although the procedure is rather simple, 
replacing the BIOS on your graphics 
card is no small matter. If something 
goes wrong, there are a number of things 
that can occur. Most often, graphics 
cards that don’t support the hack will 
appear to run normally, but without the 
extra 128 stream processors unlocked. In 
this case, there’s not much else you can 
do and you’ll be forced to flash your old 
BIOS back to the card from the backup 
(we’ll show you how to do this). 
It’s possible your graphics card will 
fail to output a visible image following 
a reboot. If this is the case, you may 
get lucky by booting the system with 
an integrated graphics adapter set 
as the primary device and using the

sidered an enthusiast-class graphics 
card, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t 
a significant number of enthusiasts 
smitten by low-power, sub -$150 graphics 
cards that target 1080p. And when you 
tell us that we can get 5 to 10% more 
performance by unlocking the card’s 
dormant 128 stream processors with a 
simple BIOS mod? Well, then you have 
our undivided attention.
We decided to put this tweak to the 
test using the two Radeon RX 460s we 
have on hand: the SAPPHIRE NITRO 
model equipped with 4GB of memory 
and the XFX RX 460 with a Double 
Dissipation cooler and a 2GB frame buffer. 
The BIOS mod we’re going to be using was 
first documented by German overclocker 
der8auer at overclocking.guide. He, with 
the help of a few other forum users, 
developed a rather simple guide and posted 
downloads that include everything we 
need. We’ll be following those procedures 
with some added information based on our 
own experiences.
At press time, supported cards include 
the ASUS RX 460 Dual OC 2GB, ASUS 
ROG STRIX Radeon RX 460 4GB OC 
Edition, GIGABYTE RX 460 Windforce 
4G and 2G, HIS RX 460 iCooler OC

Fan 2GB, XFX RX 460 Passive 4GB, and 
XFX RX 460 Double Dissipation 4GB. If 
you own or are thinking of buying one of 
these cards, chances are good you are in for 
some extra oomph.

manage to irreparably brick your card as 
a result of BIOS flashing, don’t expect 
to be able to RMA your way out of 
that hole. Although the chances of this 
happening are slim, you need to be 
aware it can happen. 
Consider also that a manufacturer may 
have a good reason for disabling parts of 
the hardware. The 128 disabled SPs on 
your RX 460 may be damaged or prone 
to errors. Additionally, graphics cards 
tend to have rather strict thermal and 
power limits, and every Radeon RX 460 
on the shelf today was designed and tested 
to perform optimally with 896 stream 
processors, not 1,024. If the unlocking is 
successful, there will be some additional 
power and heat demands put on your 
card. Consider yourself warned.
Don’t Overclock, Unlock
For those undeterred by the possible 
risks, the unlocking process is actually 
very simple, and the benefits are similar 
to a healthy overclock, but with less 
added heat and fan noise. All you need 
to do is flash a modded BIOS onto your 
Radeon RX 460 graphics card, restart 
your system, and then you’re off to the 
races, or FPSes, or whatever it is you 
happen to play. 
Although the unlocking process 
is easy to wrap your head around, the 
driver situation isn’t as straightforward. 
If you attempt to flash one of the 
modded BIOSes when running the 
latest version of AMD’s Crimson ReLive 
drivers (as we went to press, version

that didn’t stop us from trying. First 
we tried with most of the BIOSes that 
were designed to support 2GB cards. 
Although none of them managed to 
unlock the extra shaders, they were easy 
to recover from. Because there was no 
display corruption, we merely dragged 
the modded BIOS out of the folder, 
renamed the backup BIOS we created 
before flashing using the name of the 
modded BIOS, then just double-clicked 
Flash unlocked bios.bat. After a quick 
restart, our old stock BIOS was in place 
and the card was running fine. 
We ran into real trouble when we 
abandoned our better judgment by 
installing the 4GB BIOS that worked 
so well with the SAPPHIRE card. The 
result was a corrupted display and forced 
restarts. Things went from bad to worse 
when we tried to flash the backup BIOS 
during one of the short-lived periods 
where the Desktop was visible, but 
the system crashed during the flashing 
process, and now the card doesn’t output 
a display at all. We may be able to recover 
the card yet, but as we went to press, it 
was well and truly bricked. 
In our experience, the procedure 
works as described as long as you own 
one of the cards for which a modded 
BIOS exists. If a modded BIOS doesn’t 
exist for your card, we’d recommend 
checking the Overclocking.Guide article 
regularly for updates. ■

And Then There Were Three
The Top Mods In GIGABYTE’s 30th 
Anniversary Mod2Win Challenge
Last month, we talked to GIGABYTE’s Jonathan Lin in our monthly Back Door Q&A about his company’s big 30th anniversary 
mod contest and found out that the winner would be chosen shortly after our interview. Naturally, we wanted to see how things 
turned out, so we asked Lin to share the results with us for our January issue, and here we are. 
“This was an awesome mod challenge! We had a great turnout, and all the mod submissions were exceptionally built,” Lin 
says. “Seeing how each mod came to life from a concept sketch to a completed masterpiece was a real treat. Now that it’s over 
and we’re heading into CES, my team and I are very excited to finally see the top three mods in person and showcase them for 
the world to see. We hope that you’ve all enjoyed this mod challenge as much as we have.”
First Place: Project Triptych (by boloisbolo)
“I initially started with the concept in June,” says Lionel Del Fierro, aka boloisbolo. “When I first heard about the competition, I immediately went out and 
bought a GIGABYTE 980 Ti WINDFORCE to be one of stars of the build. However, shortly after having it in my possession, I had to postpone all work toward the 
build because of the birth of my son. I got back to work in September, beginning with the design of the custom case; this process was spread sporadically 
over a month until I sent it off to be manufactured. When the case finally arrived, I was ready to start building and finalizing the watercooling loop. The tubing 
took a couple days to complete, then I had to remove all the components and rebuild the system because it had to be put together in a certain order. The 
journey spanned intermittently over six months and ended in a flurry. I think the custom power button is my favorite part of the build. I know it is just a simple 
mod, with a small push button switch, wire, and some solder, but it seems to suit the design well. I forgot about putting a power button anywhere on the build 
until it was 90% complete. I didn’t want to drill any other holes or have time to order a vandal-resistant switch, so I had the idea to just hide a small power 
button in an easily accessible spot inside the case. It worked out well, and I thought that not seeing the power button was the best route aesthetically.”

Second Place: TRIGINTA (by masbuskado)
“I spent about two months working on the design and concept, and it took me about 20 days to complete the whole setup,” says Arturo Betances, aka 
masbuskado. “The main idea was to make a ‘number 30’ case from scratch to celebrate the 30th anniversary of GIGABYTE. The case has the same 
dimensions as a midtower ATX case, and its main feature is of course the huge number 30 reservoir in one side. Everything was custom made to fit into place 
like a big puzzle. This project has 98 parts that hold the frame in place. Another feature that I want to showcase in this project is that I didn’t want to have 
any visible cables or wires visible from any angle, so when I was designing the case in SolidWorks, I managed to come up with some nice ideas for obscuring 
them—even the GPU power cables, which is why the GPU is so heavily modded. My favorite part was getting back to work in SolidWorks. I brainstormed for 
about a week and drew the main concept in CorelDraw, then I was able to import my work into SolidWorks to finally see the 3D version of my main idea. From 
there, I had to add or remove some of the features that I planned for the project. At the end I truly got the results I envisioned.”
Third Place: Rehab (by InsolentGnome)
“It took about four months of working on Rehab on the side to bring it all together,” Dave Cathey, aka InsolentGnome, says. “The only original pieces of the 
case remaining are the rails, the side panel, and half of the roof panel, and all of those got customized to some degree. Nothing was left untouched. The 
inspiration for it was the ’34 Ford coupe. Half of the case was set up like an engine bay in the old coupes, so the case was widened at the back to give it 
a wedge shape and more space, and then half of the roof was replaced with hinged aluminum ‘hood.’ For the engine side, I flipped the layout of the case, 
reversing the motherboard on a custom tray and tried to place components to mimic the look of engine parts. The pump wound up spoofing the master 
cylinder, the GPU the valve cover, and the motherboard the block. To give it even more of a hot rod look, I used an automotive overflow catch can as the 
reservoir and put automotive gauges in as well, which actually work and monitor some system vitals. The other side of the interior got a custom trunk 
treatment, with a cloth panel covering, billet accents, and a fire extinguisher for the fun of it. The exterior got metallic blue paint and old-school flames along 
with a new side window, back panel, and custom front grille.”

Launch Platform 
New Chipsets & New Boards Kick Off A New World 
Of Build Possibilities
C
hipset launches are unique in the 
realm of computing because they 
tend to act as a bellwether for the 
technologies that are on the verge of going 
mainstream. They’re also gatekeepers that 
can kill a fledgling standard dead if Intel or 
AMD decide to scratch it from the block 
diagram at exactly the wrong moment. We 
have a love-hate relationship with chipset 
launches; they’re like a line in the sand that 
lets us look back to see how far we’ve come, 
but they also show us how far behind the 
curve our current systems have fallen. With 
the launch of Intel’s new 200 Series chipsets, 
the urge to upgrade intensifies once again. 
A Skylake Refresher
Intel’s 6th generation processor family, 
also known as Skylake, was designed in 
tandem with the supporting 100 Series 
chipset. The flagship Intel Core i7-6700K 
and its less powerful siblings are built 
on a 14nm manufacturing process, like 
the Broadwell-based processors before 
them that debuted in early 2015. As a 
tock in Intel’s long-running tick-tock 
cadence (a new process followed by a new 
architecture), Skylake processors were 
redesigned from the ground up, with 
overclockers and enthusiasts in mind. 
Of course, Intel continued its practice 
of unlocking the multipliers of its K Series 
Skylake processors, but overclockers using 
the platform also enjoyed significantly 
more granular clocking capabilities. The 
PEG/DMI domain features an isolated 
100MHz clock, so users no longer 
have to bother with PEG/DMI ratios. 
Additionally, the BCLK has full support 
for fine-grain overclocking. Although 
still dual-channel, 100 Series chipset-
MSI’s Z270 GAMING PRO CARBON motherboard harnesses the full power of the Z270 chipset. 
And it ain’t half-bad-looking, either.
46 January2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

calling the process 14PLUS, 14nm+, or 
14FF+. The key takeaway for 14PLUS is a 
transistor with improved transistor channel 
strain, a higher fin height, and larger pitch; 
these factors reduce the IC density and 
allow for up to 12% higher performance. 
This is good news for overclockers. 
If we were following Intel’s traditional 
release schedule, then Broadwell was the 
tick and Skylake was the tock, making 
Kaby Lake the odd man out. But last year, 
Intel announced that for the foreseeable 
future it was abandoning tick-tock for a new 
scheme, called PAO (Process-Architecture-
Optimization). In this scenario, Kaby 
Lake is the Optimization phase. Although 
this new scheme signals a slower pace for 
based motherboards support DDR4 and 
DDR3L memory. In the months following 
the 100 Series chipset release, we have 
witnessed a gradual decline in DDR4 
prices and an inverse climb in clock speeds. 
Pumping The Brakes 
With Kaby Lake 
Kaby Lake’s first processors to see the 
light of day were actually the mobile 
variants, and they have been available in 
laptops and mobile devices for several 
months already. These, as well as the 
processors launching in the first half of this 
year are the third product line to rely on 
the 14nm manufacturing process, although 
Intel has made tweaks to the formula, 
Intel, this is good news for those of us 
who upgrade parts on a piecemeal basis. 
Skylake processors will work in Kaby 
Lake motherboards, and in most cases, 
Kaby Lake processors will work in Skylake 
motherboards. As we went to press, nearly 
all Skylake motherboard manufacturers 
have released or announced the impending 
release of a BIOS update that would make 
their boards compatible with Kaby Lake. 
We mentioned Kaby Lake processors 
would have higher clocks, but how much 
higher? The Core i7-7700K, for example, has 
a 4.2GHz base clock and a Turbo frequency 
up to 4.5GHz. Remember, the Skylake 
flagship has 4GHz base and 4.2GHz Turbo 
clocks, giving Kaby Lake a 200MHz to 
300MHz advantage. The more nimble Kaby 
Lake processors will also be able to change 
clock speeds faster, in as few as 10ms, thanks 
to a technology called Speed Shift v2. Skylake 
processors took as much as 30ms to change 
clock speeds. Other Kaby Lake processor 
highlights include enhanced graphics cores 
and support for Intel Optane Technology, 
but we’ll dig into that more later. 
In addition to the couple of mobile Kaby 
Lake processors launched late last year, 
Intel plans to release at least 11 quad-core 
desktop processors based on the Kaby Lake 
microarchitecture. 
On Point With Union Point
The 200 Series chipset, code-named 
“Union Point,” is built around the LGA 
1151 socket, just like the 100 Series chipset. 
It’ll come as no surprise that there are 
multiple 200 Series chipsets, each targeting 
a different market. The mainstream 200 
Series segment will consist of three chipsets, 
the Q270, H270, and H250. The business 
and office PC-friendly chipset is the B250. 
The one we’re most interested in, however, 
is the Z270 PCH, which features the best 
support for overclocking and enthusiast-
class PC components. 
Music To Your Ears
When you pair a motherboard based on 
Intel’s Z270 chipset and a 7th Generation 
Intel Core processor, you get access to Intel 
Ready Mode Technology, a new alternative 
to the traditional sleep mode that lets the 
Intel’s new Kaby Lake processors feature a handful of enhancements made to the graphics and 
media encode/decode engines.
CPU  /  January2017 47

HEVC Main, HEVC Main10, VP9 8-bit, 
and H.264 profile videos. It also adds VP9 
10-bit decode in hardware and native HDCP 
2.2 support. This results in significantly more 
power-efficient video playback and media 
creation for those who enjoy and work with 
4K content. Other benefits of the platform 
include support for Wide Color Gamut and 
HDR, as well as more immersive 3D movies 
thanks to Intel InTru 3D technology.
Intel Optane Technology
In last month’s Whitepaper, we wrote at 
length about phase-change memory from 
PC save power, but wake instantly to display 
notifications and stay up-to-date all the time. 
The Z270 chipset also supports Intel Smart 
Sound Technology, which adds an integrated 
audio DSP (Digital Signal Processor) that 
enables clear voice recognition and high-
fidelity audio capture without adversely 
affecting system performance.
Core Processor Eye Candy
Kaby Lake processors feature an enhanced 
media engine that together with a 200 
Series chipset-based motherboard supports 
hardware-based encode and decode of 4K 
IBM. Intel and Micron jointly developed their 
take on PCM, called 3D XPoint (pronounced 
“crosspoint”) memory, which hopes to deliver 
DRAM’s speed, but in a nonvolatile state like 
SSDs and HDDs and at the cost of today’s 
TLC (Triple Level Cell)-based storage devices. 
Intel’s Kaby Lake processors support 3D 
XPoint in the form of Optane Technology, 
which supports non-volatile memory (NVM) 
devices that measure latency in tens of 
nanoseconds instead of tens of microseconds 
(like current SSDs), but with significantly 
higher densities than current NVM. It’s like 
the fastest of today’s SSD, on steroids. 
The block diagram of the Z270 chipset gives you a good idea of how the processor and chipset work in tandem to make a solid platform for enthusiast PCs.

3.0 M.2 ports. The USB controllers let you 
selectively disable any one or multiple USB 
ports, giving publicly accessible PCs an 
added layer of security. 
Networking on the 200 Series comes 
courtesy of an Intel 10/100/1000 MAC. 
We spoke briefly about the audio support 
improvements largely stemming from the 
7th Generation Core Processors, but on the 
chipset there’s still support for Intel High 
Definition Audio. 
There are a handful of optional Z270 
features that will vary from motherboard 
to motherboard. One of these is support 
for the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility, 
which is one of the better software-based 
overclocking applications we’ve used. Intel 
Rapid Storage Technology with RAID 
support is self-explanatory, and definitely 
something you’ll want if insanely fast storage 
is high on your list of computing priorities. 
Intel has discontinued its Smart Connect 
Technology, which periodically wakes the 
PC to keep notifications, emails, and social 
media networks up-to-date, so you aren’t 
likely to see it on many Kaby Lake-based 
systems. Intel Device Protection Technology 
with Boot Guard is a useful feature that 
Intel Z270 Chipset Features
Intel’s 7th Generation Core processors 
have access to a single x16 lanes PCIe 3.0 
interface, which can be split into two x8 
lanes, or a single x8 and two x4 lanes. As 
in the 100 Series, the processor connects to 
the chipset using a DMI 3.0 bus. They can 
also output to three independent displays 
and the internal memory controller is 
dual-channel, with support for DDR4 and 
DDR3L at speeds up to 2,400MHz and 
1,600MHz, respectively. That doesn’t sound 
very fast, but based on our experience with 
the handful of Kaby Lake motherboards in 
this issue, OC speeds are supported up to 
4,000MHz and possibly beyond.  
On the chipset side of the block diagram, 
there are now 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes available, 
with each one capable of operating at up to 
8Gbps. The 100 Series chipset, you’ll recall, 
had four fewer PCIe 3.0 lanes to offer. 
From here on, the 200 Series and 100 Series 
chipsets are remarkably similar, with each 
featuring up to six SATA 3.0 ports (6Gbps), 
up to 10 USB 3.0 ports (5Gbps), and up 
to 14 USB 2.0 ports (480Mbps). Intel 
Rapid Storage Technology for PCI Express 
Storage enables support for three x4 PCIe 
prevents the system’s pre-OS environment 
from getting infected with malware. 
Less Is . . . Just Less
The block diagram for the Q270 chipset 
looks identical to that of the Z270. On the 
H270 and B250 chipsets, however, you’ll 
have a less flexible PCIe 3.0 graphics interface 
on the processor, precluding multi-GPU 
setups. The H270 also gives you four fewer 
PCIe lanes from the chipset and two fewer 
USB 3.0 ports to work with. The B250 limits 
your options even further, with 12 PCIe 3.0 
lanes, six USB 3.0 ports, and 12 USB 2.0 
ports. Motherboards based on these pared-
down chipsets will likely feature fewer of the 
available features overall to keep prices in line 
with customer expectations. 
Get Ready For Kaby, Baby
The unassuming chipset won’t ever get the 
kind of attention a processor gets, or a top-tier 
GPU, and often they’re forced to play second 
fiddle to the latest solid-state storage devices 
and overclocked LED-laden DRAM, but 
none of the above can stand on its own. Intel’s 
latest 200 Series is going to bring a lot of great 
things to PCs in 2017 and beyond. ■
There’s not a whole lot of difference between the 100 Series and 200 Series chipsets, but Kaby Lake makes an ideal upgrade for those running 
Haswell or older processors.

Hellfire Unleashed 
Patriot Enters The PCIe SSD Arms Race
Now, we’ve harnessed some of that 
bandwidth for SSDs. Combined with a 
storage interface that was built from the 
ground up to address solid-state drives’ 
distinct characteristics (that would be 
NVMe, which has finally freed SSDs 
from the contraints of AHCI, a storage 
interface that was developed during the 
era of HDDs), the storage revolution 
was complete.
In early 2016, Patriot announced 
the impending arrival of its Hellfire 
PCIe SSD family. Later in the year, 
240GB and 480GB drives materialized. 
True to its name, Hellfire delivers 
scorching throughput for blazing-fast 
performance. This didn’t happen by 
accident, though, as Patriot took time 
to carefully choose and test individual 
components to ensure the Hellfire was a 
formidable PCIe SSD.
Patriot’s Plans
Like the company does with all of its 
hardware, Patriot began development 
on the Hellfire drives with very specific 
goals in mind. According to Les Henry, 
P
atriot is no stranger to solid-state 
drives. Over the years, power users 
could count on the company, 
which is based in Fremont, Calif., 
to be among the first to adopt new 
technologies and components. When 
SSDs were still in their infancy, Patriot 
recognized their potential and developed 
drives for enthusiasts who craved that 
unprecedented performance.
Now, these enthusiasts have recognized 
that unprecedented performance no 
longer means SSDs that operate over 
the 6Gbps SATA bus. Although slower 
SATA-based SSDs still have a home in 
most PCs, bottlenecks from the SATA bus 
itself have relegated 6Gbps SATA SSDs to 
second-tier storage duty. They’re great for 
storing apps, games, and other files that 
aren’t a top priority, but for the operating 
system and any programs that need 
unmatched throughput, a new champion 
has claimed the throne.
The PCI Express bus isn’t a new 
innovation, clearly, but for years it 
mostly served up its considerable 
bandwidth to a system’s graphics card(s). 
Patriot VP of Engineering, performance 
was key.
“Since this was our first PCIe drive 
of any type, we were really focused 
on coming out with a drive with high 
performance,” Henry says.
Because SSDs impact PC performance 
in so many tasks, and because enthusiasts 
tend to be a demanding bunch, Patriot’s 
engineers knew they had to select 
outstanding components from established 
manufacturers. Ultimately, Patriot settled 
on a storage controller from Phison and 
Toshiba MLC NAND. These would 
become the fundamental building blocks 
of Patriot’s initial Hellfire PCIe SSDs.
Hellfire Under The Microscope
Although consumer-grade PCIe 
SSDs have existed for a few years, 
drives that use both the PCIe bus and 
NVMe interface are relatively new. The 
number of available storage controllers 
designed for these cutting-edge drives 
is small compared to 6Gbps SATA 
SSDs. Henry says Patriot relied on its 
established partnership with Phison to 
The SSD is dead, long live the SSD! In 2016, 6Gbps SATA solid-state drives accepted defeat that a newer, more powerful class of SSD was ready 
to take over as the new performance champ. Patriot, which has always had a keen understanding of what enthusiasts want, joined the fray with a 
pair of powerful PCIe SSDs, the 240GB and 480GB Hellfire drives.
50 January2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

MLC NAND over TLC NAND. The 
other main advantage you get with MLC 
NAND over TLC NAND is an increase 
in TBW [total bytes written, a measure 
of a solid-state drive’s endurance].” 
Henry adds, however, that Patriot is 
exploring 3D TLC NAND for future 
PCIe SSDs in order to expand the 
company’s offerings.
Currently, Patriot only offers its 
Hellfire drives in an M.2 form factor 
without an add-in adapter card that 
connects to a motherboard’s PCIe slot, 
although Henry isn’t ruling out such an 
option in the future. He explains that 
Patriot carefully examined the market and 
determined that most power users had 
motherboards capable of accommodating 
M.2 drives without an adapter.
Enthusiasts who lack an M.2 slot for 
the Hellfire still have an easy alternative 
to add one of Patriot’s powerful SSDs 
to their system. By simply purchasing 
the right AIC, one can upgrade to the 
Hellfire by installing the drive in the 
find a controller that would be a good 
fit. Eventually, Henry says, Patriot 
settled on the 5007-E7.
“When we first started investigating 
PCIe solutions, there really were 
not many options in terms of PCIe 
controllers to choose from,” he explains. 
“There were only a handful of PCIe 
NVMe SSDs out in the market. Patriot 
has had a very good partnership with 
Phison, for many years, and we decided 
to test out their 5007-E7 controller 
for our Hellfire line. After testing the 
drives, we compared our results to some 
of the other drives that were already on 
the market. We were very pleased with 
the performance results and decided to 
launch with their controller.”
The Phison 5007-E7 controller that 
calls the shots for the Hellfire is an 
8-channel chip with a few tricks up its 
sleeve. In addition to supporting MLC 
and TLC NAND, the 5007-E7 can also 
address 3D NAND, an attribute that 
could pay dividends in the near future, 
as Patriot explores using 3D NAND 
in future drives. As far as standards go, 
Phison’s controller is compatible with 
PCIe 3.0 x4 and NVMe 1.1b. Phison 
also includes ECC (120bits/2KB), static 
and dynamic wear leveling, and end-
to-end data path protection.
High-performance MLC NAND pairs 
quite nicely with Phison’s 5007-E7, and 
Toshiba answers the call for the Hellfire 
drive. Specifically, the SSDs use planar 
NAND (which means individual cells 
are spread across the die horizontally in a 
single layer; this has been the established 
process for several years) fabricated using 
a 15nm process. Patriot plants packages 
of NAND on both sides of the Hellfire’s 
PCB. Consistent with Patriot’s goal 
of entering the market with a high-
performance PCIe SSD, Henry says the 
company decided against cheaper but 
less effective TLC NAND.
“One advantage that we have 
found with MLC over TLC NAND 
is the performance increase in the 4K 
write IOPS. Since we were looking at 
performance as the key feature for our 
Hellfire line, we decided to go with 
adapter card and then connecting the card 
to an open PCIe slot. Keep in mind that 
legacy motherboards may not give users 
access to PCIe 3.0 and/or NVMe, so the 
Hellfire may not deliver the same results 
as it would in a cutting-edge rig.
However, like the Hellfire’s NAND, 
Henry says that Patriot is investigating the 
possibility of introducing future Hellfire 
SSDs in a variety of form factors. “Going 
forward, we are looking at multiple 
options for PCIe storage,” he says, “such 
as an AIC, 3D TLC NAND for our 
next-gen M.2 drives, as well as coming 
out with a 2.5-inch U.2 SSD lineup.”
Patriot uses a cache of low-power 
DDR3 in its Hellfire drives. The 480GB 
has 512MB of LP-DDR3, and the 
240GB drive has half that—256MB. 
Other features include TRIM support, 
bad block management, and advanced 
garbage collection.
The combination of Phison’s 
5007-E7 controller, high-quality MLC 
NAND, and a modern storage interface 
Working together, Phison’s 5007-E7 controller and an array of Toshiba 15nm planar MLC NAND Flash 
let Patriot’s Hellfire solid-state drives do amazing things. Both the 240GB and 480GB drives are capable 
of throughput that puts 6Gbps SATA SSDs to shame.
CPU  /  January2017 51

Henry says that Patriot’s 
next generation of PCIe 
SSDs will include a thermal 
sensor on the PCB in order 
to obtain a temperature 
reading for the drive as a 
whole. He also mentions 
the possibility of installing 
a heat spreader over the 
controller of future models, 
which would keep the 
drives’ thermals in check, 
particularly under heavy 
workloads.
A couple of PCIe SSD 
manufacturers have dev-
eloped specific NVMe 
drivers for their drives, but 
Patriot opted to stick with 
Microsoft’s native NVMe 
driver. Henry says that 
this driver is compatible 
with and optimized for all 
NVMe SSDs, but he doesn’t 
rule out the possibility of 
Patriot introducing its own 
NVMe driver in the future.
Play With Fire
Expect 2017 to be an 
even busier year for Patriot, 
as the company’s master 
plan includes new drives 
for the New Year. On the 
other hand, if your PC is 
in dire need of an infusion 
of speed, the current duo 
of Hellfire PCIe SSDs are 
ready to roll. ■
add up to a pair of PCIe SSDs that are 
among the fastest consumer drives on 
the planet. To wit, Patriot advertises 
that both capacities of Hellfire deliver 
sequential reads of 3,000MBps when 
tested with ATTO. In sequential 
writes, only 100MBps separates 
the 240GB Hellfire from its bigger 
brother, with the drives humming 
along at 2,300MBps and 2,400MBps, 
respectively. You’ll find a similar story 
with the Hellfire drives’ random 
performance. Both SSDs pump out 
170,000 IOPS on 4K reads; the 480GB 
Hellfire plows through random writes 
at 210,000 IOPS, while the 240GB 
version is capable of 185,000 IOPS.
Sensors & Drivers
Eagle-eyed observers might notice 
that the Hellfire’s thermal sensor peaks 
at 125 degrees Celsius, while Patriot 
rates the drive’s maximum operating 
temperature at 70 C. Henry elaborates 
on the differing temperating ratings: 
“Our thermal sensor is currently built 
into the controller. This means that 
when you get a temperature reading 
from our drives, you are actually just 
seeing the temperature of the controller 
and not the whole drive. Many of our 
competitors have a separate thermal 
sensor located on the PCB, which 
gives an accurate reading of the drive. 
When you compare our temperature 
reading compared to the competition it 
looks like our Hellfire drive is running 
much hotter. Unfortunately, it’s not an 
accurate comparison.”
Available for a little over $0.50/GB, Patriot’s 240GB Hellfire M.2 SSD is a terrific option for 
budget-conscious builders who don’t want to sacrifice performance. In most workloads, 
this drive nearly matches the 480GB Hellfire stride for stride.

HELLFIRE BY THE NUMBERS
52 January2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

Gary “NavyChief” Murphy has won CPU’s Mad Reader Mod contest twice; his QuakeCon 800D mod was on the cover of our 
August 2013 issue, and his Toxic Envi mod shared the September 2014 cover with winners from two other categories at that 
year’s QuakeCon event. His uber-impressive BAWLS mod won first place at the 2016 DreamHack Austin event and also took 
second place at this year’s QuakeCon mod contest (Case Mod category).
Modder Q&A: Gary Murphy
A Place For Everything 
& Everything In Its Place
to try my hand at fabricating a custom water 
reservoir and replacing the front panel with 
an infinity mirror.
Q
: We’ve seen many, many first-time 
mods, and it’s fair to say you came out 
of the gate pretty strong. What skills did 
you already have when started modding, 
and which ones did you have to develop?
GM
: My only real initial skill was 
planning. I always do a ton 
of research before and during each build. I 
typically spend at least two months thinking of 
GM
: I have completed three case mods 
since that first attempt (Toxic 
Envi, BAWLS, and Apeiro). The Toxic 
Envi and BAWLS builds were made for 
the QuakeCon case modding competition, 
while the Apeiro build was done for the 2016 
GIGABYTE 30th Anniversary Mod2Win 
case mod challenge. With each build, I try 
and challenge myself to incorporate a new 
technique or style. My first mod (QuakeCon 
800D) used vinyl tubing, my next (Toxic 
Envi) used acrylic tubing, and the BAWLS 
build utilized chrome-plated copper tubing. 
For my most recent build (Apeiro), I decided 
Q
: You’ve been very competitive in 
quite a few QuakeCon mod contests 
now. How many times have you attended 
QuakeCon, and how many times have 
you entered the mod contest there?
GM
: My first QuakeCon was in 
2009 when it was at the 
Gaylord Texan hotel. I went as a General 
Attendee to see what this event was and 
fell in love with what I experienced. To 
have so many PC gamers and modders 
in one area is absolutely thrilling. I can 
talk shop with other modders and learn 
new techniques firsthand. This year 
was my eighth QuakeCon and will not 
be my last by any measure. In fact, the 
QuakeCon case mod contest (run by 
Modders-Inc) is what got me interested 
in case modding. In 2010 and 2011 I 
watched the case mod contest closely 
and looked at what the winning builds 
did to set them apart from the other 
entrants. I thought, “That doesn’t look 
too difficult. Let me see what I can do.” 
I have entered the case mod contest four 
times (2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016). 
The only gap was 2013; I volunteered 
to be a guest judge for the contest that 
year. My tally for this event stands at two 
first-place wins, one second-place, and 
one third-place finish.
Q
: Back in 2013, you told us that you 
had built other systems in the past, 
but that your orange QuakeCon 800D rig 
was your first mod. How many mods have 
you completed since then?
Gary “NavyChief” Murphy and his award-winning QuakeCon 800D mod.
CPU  /  January2017 53

traditional mods of existing stock cases. 
Have you given any thought to entering a 
Scratch Build or Behesda/id mod? 
GM
: I have never even considered the 
Scratch Build category. I just do 
not have the skillset to actually build a case 
from scratch; at least not at this point in time. 
With the ever-increasing plethora of PC cases 
available on the market, I just don’t see the 
need to create my own. As for the Bethesda/
id theme, I have never really contemplated 
that one, either. I prefer to develop a build 
with minimal restrictions and to let my 
imagination run freely. Limiting myself to a 
specific theme such as a Bethesda/id concept 
just does not sound reasonable. Now, if I 
come up with a theme that could fit into that 
category, then I would definitely consider it. 
The theme should always come first; once 
finished then I can decide which case mod 
category to enter the build into.
Q
: What’s your favorite mod of all the 
projects you’ve done, and why?
GM
: My favorite would have to be 
the BAWLS build. The sheer size 
of it—it’s 3 feet tall—and the chrome bling 
get a lot of attention. It was fun to build a 
modding community is all about helping 
each other, and new modders are always 
welcome to ask questions. It is this “modders 
helping modders” environment that keeps 
me coming back for more each year.
Q
: What modder would you say inspires 
you the most today?
GM
: I would have to say that the 
Modders-Inc duo of Dewayne 
Carel and Craig Tate keep inspiring me each 
and every year. They run the case modding 
contest at QuakeCon and continually push us 
to step up our game. After every QuakeCon, 
they hold a podcast and talk about the 
case mods and how the event went. I have 
learned so much from those recordings. Their 
feedback is both critical and honest. They 
won’t hold anything back, so be prepared for 
the brutal truth. The key is to actually listen 
to their feedback and make the appropriate 
changes, if necessary. Their good nature and 
extensive knowledge lends them credibility 
that is hard to match. They really run a good 
event at QuakeCon and it is becoming one of 
the major case mod events in North America.
Q
: All of your QuakeCon entries so far 
have been for the Case Mod category—
a theme, searching the web to ensure it hasn’t 
been done before and that it is technically 
feasible. Only then do I begin the process of 
selecting a case, color scheme, and possible 
hardware configurations. If a design is themed 
to a company or product, I typically contact 
the company to ensure I do not violate any 
trademark use restrictions. Most companies 
are extremely supportive and appreciative of 
me taking the time to ask permission first. 
Almost all of my hardware and fabrication 
skills have been developed via the time-tested 
trial-and-error method. I have learned a lot 
by watching videos and reading build logs to 
develop my skillset. The educational aspect is 
a constant process and cannot be overlooked. 
With new tools and technologies being 
developed all the time, you must be open to 
new ways of doing things.
Q
: Did the work of any specific modders 
inspire you when you got started?
GM
: Since I have seen the work of so 
many modders, it is really difficult 
to narrow it down to any one person. The 
modding community as a whole has inspired 
me to broaden my horizon and try new ideas. 
Talking with other modders at QuakeCon 
also helped to alleviate my initial fears. The 
Murphy’s favorite project to date is a tribute to his favorite energy drink, BAWLS Guarana.
54 January2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

Q
: What would you say is your favorite 
modding-related tool?
GM
: It would definitely have to 
be my Dremel. This device is 
extremely versatile, with many possible 
configurations. It can cut, drill, and sand 
with equal precision and speed. I also 
recently picked up the Dremel Moto-Saw 
and Table Press. The other essential tools 
would be a reliable hand drill and jigsaw. 
Nothing really high-tech can be found at 
my workbench, just a lot of handheld tools 
and accessories.
Q
: What is the hardest part of a mod for 
you to get the way you want it?
GM
: It would have to be cable manage-
ment. As my handle states, I am 
a retired U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer. The 
Navy instilled in me that there should never 
be any gear adrift—nothing out of place. I 
place a huge emphasis on hiding cables and 
presenting a clean, cohesive theme. I will 
often spend whole weekends trying to find 
a way to hide any cable that just looks out of 
place. I have a very critical eye and am a little 
OCD with regards to getting everything just 
right. Definitely the hardest part of my builds 
and the most time-consuming.
Q
: It’s time for Five Quick Questions!
1) BAWLS Original or Root Beer?
BAWLS Original FTW!
2) Powder coat or paint booth?
Powder coat.
3) Cowboys or Texans?
Cowboys!
4) Deep dish or thin crust pizza?
Thin crust.
5) Counter-Strike: GO or Overwatch? 
Counter-Strike: GO. ■
that would detract from the overall build 
theme. Cabling and clutter are the biggest 
culprits. Your eyes are instantly drawn to 
the spiderweb of cabling that is evident 
in most builds. Cable management is 
taken into account during my planning 
phase, since it is something that cannot be 
left until the end. Only through proper 
planning and preparation can the build 
be completed successfully. Plan for every 
cable pass-through in the early stages 
and it will make cable management a 
breeze at the end.
Q
: Do you have a project started for the 
2017 QuakeCon yet?
GM
: I am actually thinking about 
volunteering to be a guest judge 
again. In 2013 it was such an eye-opening 
experience to see what goes into judging 
one of these events. I think it is time to lend 
my experience and help expand the judging 
pool. Each year the number of entrants 
into the case mod event keeps expanding 
and they are in need of qualified judges to 
handle the demand. I also just finished a 
build for the GIGABYTE 30th Anniversary 
Mod2Win case mod competition. The 
results of that event will be announced 
on December 1. [ED. NOTE: You’ll find 
coverage of the top three mods in this issue!] 
Now, this is not to say that I won’t bring a 
new build to QuakeCon, just that it will not 
be entered into the case mod competition.
Q
: Do you attend any other LAN parties 
aside from QuakeCon?
GM
: Texas is becoming a real power-
house with regards to LAN 
events. There are several local events that I 
like to attend: FadeCon, PowersGaming, 
and DreamHack Austin. FadeCon and 
PowersGaming are local LANs that are fun 
and keep me in touch with my gaming 
friends. DreamHack Austin is another 
major gaming LAN but definitely getting 
larger with each year. This event even has 
its own case modding competition (run by 
CPU magazine). I was lucky enough to win 
that event in 2016 and am looking forward 
to seeing what 2017 will bring.
case of that size (a big thanks to CaseLabs), 
but filling it up was really challenging. The 
STH-10 has an extreme amount of interior 
space! I even decided to try spray painting the 
case instead of powder coating. The copper 
tubing was actually easier than I thought and 
the chroming came out amazing. In fact, 
I ended up chroming the front grilles, SLI 
bridge, memory spreaders, and pump covers. 
Thankfully, this case came with an option for 
mounting wheels!
Q
: Your mods all seem to have incredible 
paint. Is that kind of your specialty, 
or is there some other technique that you 
consider your strong suit?
GM
: I would have to say that I 
actually prefer powder coating 
over spray painting. Powder coating 
provides a very durable finish and a 
wide variety of colors. As for my strong 
suit, that would definitely be cable 
management. Most anyone who looks at 
one of my builds comments that they are 
so ‘clean’ and organized. Dewayne Carel 
categorized my builds as “showroom 
quality” in one of his podcasts. At first 
I didn’t know what to think of that, but 
after contemplation I would have to agree 
with his summation. My modding style is 
definitely geared towards hiding anything 
Toxic Envi, a Murphy mod that took first in the 
QuakeCon 2014 Case Mod category.

The rise, fall, and return to prominence of the mechanical 
keyboard is one of the more bizarre turns in PC technology. 
In the late 1980s, the majority of PC users used mechanical keyboards, such as the IBM Model M, where each 
key has its own switch that provides a tactile and auditory indication when a keystroke is registered. Despite 
the feedback advantages, in the early 1990s keyboard makers began to replace mechanical switches with 
membrane and rubber dome keyswitches. Membrane keyboards were cheaper and easier to mass-produce 
than mechanical designs and quickly took over. Gone but not forgotten, the mechanical keyboard became a 
niche product that power users and gamers had to seek out.
This sad state of affairs persisted until 2010, when a few keyboard manufacturers reintroduced mechanical 
switches in keyboards designed specifically for gamers. Gamers need quick, precise responses from each 
keystroke, and the mushy, weak feedback of membrane switches didn’t cut it. As most anyone who’s used a 
mechanical keyboard can attest, it’s easy to feel a mechanical keyswitch’s actuation point.
Today’s mechanical switches are not built like the beige, buckling spring keyboards of the 1980s. Modern 
mechanical switches feature a plastic stem that, when pushed down, lets two metal contacts register a 
keystroke. A metal spring on the bottom of the stem provides resistance and pushes the stem back up. Stems 
of different shapes and sizes customize the switch’s tactile and acoustic feedback. Some switch types, for 
example, feature a bump in the stem to create physical feedback when a key is pressed. Mechanical keyboards 
with brown or blue switches are two popular switch options that provide tactile feedback.
Other switches are linear (no bump), but you’ll feel increased resistance from the spring as you get close to the 
key’s bottom travel point. Red and black are common linear switch types. Actuation force varies by the type of 
switch to further optimize the keyboard for a specific task. Lower actuation force is good for fast responses, so it’s 
especially handy in games where you need to repetitively tap keys. Higher actuation forces help to avoid accidental 
key presses when precision is critical.
There are a handful of other switch technologies around, as well. Optical switches, for instance, rely on light 
sensors to actuate, rather than metal contacts. We’ve also seen several hybrid designs that blend mechanical 
and membrane technology. The following pages detail what type of switches each keyboard uses, as well as 
other features that make it stand out from the crowd.

Use VirtualBox To Try Windows 10
M
icrosoft has made a compelling 
argument for PC users to upgrade to 
Windows 10. As of the Anniversary Update, 
the OS has officially gotten the equivalent 
of its first Service Pack. Microsoft’s free 
upgrade offer made upgrading to the new 
OS cheaper than ever. PC gamers are 
well aware that they need to be running 
Win10 to enjoy all the bells and whistles 
of DirectX 12. And for our part, we’ve 
found Microsoft’s latest OS to be a step up 
from Win7 and Win8.1 in terms of UI, 
performance, and reliability. 
There aren’t many reasons to resist 
upgrading, but we won’t say there are 
none. That’s why in this month’s 
installment of Software Tips & Projects, 
we’ll walk you through installing Win10 
in a virtual machine so you can twiddle 
its knobs, left-click its icons, and probe 
its dark corners without the pesky 
commitment that a typical OS upgrade 
entails. Win10 is great, but now you don’t 
have to take our word for it; you can see 
for yourself. 
Prerequisites & Requirements
For the sake of clarity, VirtualBox refers 
to the computer’s native OS (for us, Win7) 
as the “host,” and the one running in 
the virtual machine will be referred to as 
the “guest” OS. Before we proceed, you 
need to find a PC with Win7 or Win8.1 
installed that meets Win10’s minimum 
requirements, which include a 1GHz or 
faster processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of 
storage for the 32-bit OS or 20GB for 
64-bit OS, a DirectX 9 or newer graphics 
card with at least a WDDM 1.0 driver, 
and a monitor that supports a minimum 
resolution of 800 x 600. 
We’ll be using Oracle’s free open-
source VirtualBox software, which has its 
own set of minimum requirements. For 
the processor, Oracle says you need any 
“reasonably powerful” x86 hardware, so 
most modern processors from AMD and 
Intel should do the trick. 
One of the biggest limiting factors with 
running a VM (virtual machine) is not 
having enough memory. To effectively 
test the capabilities of Win10 in a virtual 
environment running on your current 
Win7 or Win8.1 system, you’ll need 
enough RAM to simultaneously handle 
both OSes. While it’s technically possible 
to perform this tutorial with just 4GB 
of RAM, (allocating 2GB each to the 
host and guest OSes), doing so will 
provide a less-than-optimal experience, 
and you may even run into errors or 
system hangs if you run out of memory. 
We recommend running at least 8GB of 
RAM to avoid creating a bottleneck for 
either of the OSes, but having more is 
even better. 
The VirtualBox software takes up little 
room, less than 240MB, so you should be 
good as long as you have enough room to 
handle the 16GB or 20GB demands of 
the 32-bit or 64-bit versions of Win10, 
respectively. As for VirtualBox’s supported 
operating systems, we’re pleased to 
inform you that Oracle’s software works 
with most versions of Windows, several 
Linux distributions, Mac OS X, Solaris, 
and OpenSolaris. 
Get Windows 10
The first step in this multistage process 
is to simply obtain the Win10 installation 
Windows 10 feels right at home running in Oracle’s VirtualBox. 
64 January2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

When complete, double-click the 
VirtualBox-5.1.12-112440-Win.exe file and 
click Run to launch the setup wizard. Click 
by clicking the Windows Hosts hyperlink 
under the VirtualBox Binaries heading at 
the top of the page. 
files. Visit bit.ly/1KwZCCq and click the 
Download Tool Now button, which 
deposits the MediaCreationTool.exe into 
your default DOWNLOADS folder. 
Launch the file, then click Run. 
The first screen you see is effectively 
an end-user license agreement, so click 
Accept to proceed. Now, click the Create 
Installation Media For Another PC radio 
button and click Next. Using the drop-
down boxes on the following page, select 
your preferred Language, Edition, and 
Architecture (64-bit, 32-bit, or both), and 
then click Next. Although this procedure 
won’t directly result in you installing 
Win10 and using your Win7 or Win8.1 
license to take advantage of the free 
upgrade, you may decide that upgrading 
is worth it, and having already downloaded 
the appropriate version at this stage will 
make the upgrade process that much easier. 
The following screen lets you opt to 
download the OS install files and burn 
them to a USB flash drive (we previously 
covered this method in our Win10 clean 
installation tutorial) or as an .ISO file. For 
this tutorial, we’ll be choosing the latter 
option, so click the ISO File radio button 
and click Next. Choose a location for 
the download and then click Save. The 
files will download quickly as long as you 
have a reasonably snappy connection. The 
Windows 10 Setup box will then verify the 
downloaded files and proceed to create the 
Windows.iso. All told, the process should 
take between five and 10 minutes. 
There’s a hyperlink in the Windows 10 
Setup box that launches the DVD Burner 
utility for creating a disc-based version of 
the Win10 installer, but VirtualBox can 
work directly with the .ISO file, so we’ll 
ignore the hyperlink and click Finish. 
As we went to press, the Windows.iso 
weighed in at 3.38GB. 
Get VirtualBox
The next step involves downloading 
and installing VirtualBox. For our 
tutorial, we’re using a Win7-based laptop. 
Start by directing your web browser of 
choice to bit.ly/1nlDA5d to see the latest 
list of VirtualBox downloads. Download 
VirtualBox (version 5.1.12 at press time) 
You can skip the part where you burn the .ISO file to disc. 
The procedure for obtaining the Windows 10 .ISO file would be the same if you were planning to 
perform a clean install of the OS from disc.

Click New from the top left of the window 
to launch the Create Virtual Machine wizard 
in guided mode. To begin, give the virtual 
machine an appropriate name, then use the 
Unboxing VirtualBox 
Upon launch, you’ll see the Oracle 
VM VirtualBox Manager window with a 
welcome message displayed in the right pane. 
Next to proceed to the installation options 
screen where the box on the right side of the 
screen tells you how large the installation 
will be and how many subfeatures you have 
selected. From here, you can also change the 
default install location. Once you’ve made 
the appropriate selections and omissions 
(we won’t need Python 2.x support), click 
Next. The following screen lets you opt in 
or out of creating shortcuts, a Start menu 
entry, and registering file associations. We 
recommend leaving the checkboxes marked 
and clicking Next. A Network Interfaces 
warning window appears to inform you 
that installing VirtualBox’s networking 
feature will reset our current connection 
and temporarily disconnect the system from 
the network. Click Yes to proceed and then 
click Install. 
During the process, you’ll encounter 
several Windows Security alerts asking 
whether you want to install the Oracle 
Corporation Universal Serial Bus device, 
network adapter, and network service. 
Click the Install buttons on these alerts 
to proceed. After installation, the setup 
wizard has a checked box that launches 
Oracle VM VirtualBox, so just click the 
Finish button to proceed. 
Click the Install button three times, or click it 
once after checking the Always Trust Software 
From Oracle Corporation checkbox. 
The Create Virtual Machine wizard is easy to use, especially in guided mode. 
Oracle’s VirtualBox software is free, open source, and easy to use.

click Storage from the list of icons on the 
left, click the disc icon with the green plus 
sign at the top right of the Storage Tree 
box, click Choose Disk from the dialog 
box, navigate to the Windows.iso file, and 
then click Open. You can delete the Empty 
optical drive using the red minus icon just 
process can take some time depending on 
the size and settings you chose. 
Win10 On The VM
Our next task is to install Win10 to the 
virtual machine using the .ISO file. From 
the VirtualBox Manager’s Settings menu, 
pair of drop-down menus to set the Type 
to Microsoft Windows and the Version to 
Windows 10 32-bit or 64-bit, depending on 
the version of the .ISO file you downloaded. 
Click Next to proceed to the memory 
allocation screen, which features a slider you 
can drag from as low as 4MB to up to the full 
amount of memory installed on your system. 
The bar features green, orange, and red 
sections, and we recommend sticking to the 
green ranges to avoid starving your host OS 
of memory. For our 64-bit version of Win10, 
2GB (2,048MB) is the recommended 
amount. We want our experience to be as 
optimal as possible, so the more memory you 
can devote to the VM, the better. 
First, we went to the System Tray to get 
an idea of the background apps running and 
killed any that we deemed non-critical. Next 
we clicked CTRL+ALT+DELETE, clicked 
Start Task Manager, and scanned the items 
on the Processes tab for any nonessential 
background applications that consume a lot 
of memory and killed them. Next we clicked 
the Performance tab to see just how much 
of our 8GB of system memory was actually 
available. We were sitting at 3.31GB used, or 
about 41%. To play it safe, we used the slider 
to allocate 4GB to the Windows 10 guest 
OS, leaving the remaining 4GB to the host 
OS, then clicked Next. 
On the next screen, you’re prompted 
to either create a virtual storage device, 
use an existing one, or skip this step. For 
our purposes, click the radio button on 
the second option, to Create A Virtual 
Hard Disk Now, then click Create. The 
next step lets you choose one of three hard 
disk file types, but the default option, VDI 
(VirtualBox Disk Image), is sufficient for 
our purposes, so leave it selected and click 
Next. Here we have the option to either 
let the system use a dynamic allocation 
method for establishing the size of the 
guest OS’s hard disk, or set a fixed size. 
We’ll choose the fixed size option and 
click Next. When choosing a size, make 
sure your system storage has enough 
free capacity to handle the amount you 
set aside for the guest OS. On the File 
Location and Size screen, name the virtual 
hard disk file and set its size to the 25GB 
before clicking the Create button. This 
Eliminate Automatic Reboots In Windows 7
Because this month’s topic is directed at legacy Microsoft OS users, we thought it would be 
appropriate to include a Registry edit that caters to Windows 7 users. This one keeps the OS from 
automatically restarting after installing updates. Win10 users can schedule restarts, so a Registry edit 
of this type is less useful for them. Incidentally, this tweak also works in Windows XP and Vista, but if 
you’re running one of those OSes, automatic reboots are the least of your problems. 
First, click the Start button, click in the search field, type regedit, and then press ENTER. 
Next navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, SOFTWARE, POLICIES, MICROSOFT, WINDOWS, 
WINDOWSUPDATE. If you don’t have a WINDOWSUPDATE folder in the WINDOWS folder, we can fix 
that right now. With Windows selected in the file tree in the left pane, right-click in the right pane and 
click New, Key, then name the new folder WINDOWSUPDATE and press ENTER. 
Next, make sure the WINDOWSUPDATE folder is highlighted in the left pane, then right-click in the right 
pane and click New, DWORD (32-bit) Value, then name the item NoAutoRebootWithLoggedOnUsers and 
press ENTER. Double-click the DWORD you just created and type a 1 into the Value Data text box, then 
click OK. Now all you need to do is log out and log back in, and the tweak will be active.

Windows 7 users sick of automatic reboots will appreciate this quick fix.

window, and only by pressing the right 
CTRL key can you release the cursor to work 
with other applications. In this instance, 
however, Win10 supports a feature called 
Mouse Pointer Integration, which lets us 
seamlessly jump between the VirtualBox 
window and other applications without 
having to press a special hotkey. 
If you’ve installed a Microsoft OS from 
an ISO or Flash drive recently, then the 
Windows Setup screen will look familiar. As 
the installation begins, you’ll be prompted 
to type in a license key, but you can click 
the I Don’t Have A Product Key hyperlink 
to bypass this process for the time being and 
proceed directly to the version select screen. 
Choose the version you want to install, click 
Next, click the I Accept The License Terms 
checkbox on the EULA screen, click Next 
again, and then click the Custom: Install 
Windows Only (Advanced) option. 
The storage selection screen will display 
the unallocated space you set aside during the 
VirtualBox setup process, so select it, click 
New, then click Next. From here on, you 
just need to follow the on-screen prompts 
to complete the Win10 installation process. 
Having installed Win10 numerous times 
on more than a dozen devices, we can tell 
you that the VirtualBox install process is 
identical to what you’d experience if you were 
performing a clean install of the new OS. 
Once the OS is installed, you can 
simply click Start to promptly boot into 
Win10. Click View from the menu bar 
at the top of the VirtualBox window and 
click Full-Screen Mode, then right-click 
the Win10 Desktop background, click 
Display Settings, click Advanced Display 
Settings, and then set the resolution to 
your monitor’s native resolution. 
OS Inception
We know what you’re thinking, but 
if you plan to install VirtualBox inside 
your virtualized Win10 machine to run 
Ubuntu, then you’re going to need a lot 
more memory. All jokes aside, if you want 
to really dig deep, check out the numerous 
Software Tips & Projects articles we’ve 
written over the past year and a half to

Click OK when you’re finished. 
Now, it’s time to start the VM by clicking 
the Start button. If you have used VirtualBox 
before, you may recall an annoying quirk 
called “mouse capture,” which effectively 
locks the mouse cursor inside of the VM’s 
below the Storage Tree box. Click OK to 
close the dialog box. 
Click the Settings icon again and click 
Display from the icons menu. Make sure 
the Video Memory and Monitor Count 
sliders are both within the green sections 
of the sliders. You can enable 2D and 
When you see the Windows 10 Desktop, that’s your cue to start playing around. 
The Windows 10 install process that occurs inside VirtualBox is identical to the real deal.

Despite its name, Registry Finder does a 
lot more than dig through your Registry in 
search of this or that key. The handy little 
tool also doubles as an editor, and you can 
do your editing within the program’s Find 
Results pane. In version 2.15, Registry Finder 
learns a handful of new tricks. Now, you 
can use regular expressions with the Search 
and Replace operations, and the Replace 
command will replace every instance of a 
matched substring, rather than only the first. 
A new command line parameter, “--newTab,” 
opens a new tab, unsurprisingly, and now 
double-clicking the address bar outside of a 
tab opens a new local Registry tab.

AnyDesk 3.0
AnyDesk relies on a proprietary video 
codec to give it a leg up on the competition; 
the software laughs in the face of low frame 
rates and high latency. An integrated address 
book is the marquee feature in AnyDesk 
3.0. The new address book is admittedly 
geared toward AnyDesk Pro users (read: 
IT staff at SMBs), but those who take 
advantage of the feature should be delighted 
with its power. Using a new hierarchical 
tagging system, users managing large 
numbers of systems can create groups and 
quickly search them to pinpoint machines 
they need to remotely access. AnyDesk 3.0’s 
interface receives a new coat of polish, too; 
the slicker UI should be a good match for 
Windows 10 systems.

Devolutions Remote Desktop 
Manager Enterprise Edition 12.0.5.0
For some power users, a basic PC-to-PC 
remote desktop app will get the job done. 
For bigger jobs, you need a command center. 
Remote Desktop Manager is definitely the 
latter. Like AnyDesk Pro, Remote Desktop 
Manager is also built for SMBs and 
enterprises, which can put the program’s 
power to use. Although the latest version 
introduces a pair of minor improvements 
(MySQL support for role-based security and 
a User Interface option in Contact/Data 
Entry/Document), the 12.0.0.0 release at the 
end of November 2016 was jam-packed with

more. Notably, many of these outlets 
stem from people who themselves were 
once in dire financial straits. 
“Technology is no longer a luxury for 
only a select few investors; it’s available 
to all investors and has made it easier to 
get started,” says Alex Rupert, an assistant 
portfolio manager and contributor at 
Investopedia.com. “The internet has also 
increased the speed of trading, giving 
some skilled traders who have more 
advanced technology a leg up.” 
Philip “PT” Taylor, founder of the 
PT Money blog, sees huge potential in 
newer fintech (financial technology). 
“The more technology can be 
leveraged to help us overcome our own 
advisors. While you’ll receive little to no 
personalized advice, nearly every platform 
offers at least some tools, research, and 
data to help make informed decisions. 
Many platforms also specifically cater 
to investment novices via free accounts, 
no minimum investment limits, and 
simplified approaches. Robo-advisors, for 
example, essentially automate the process 
through algorithm-based approaches.
In addition to online investing, the 
internet helped bring about a wealth of 
free accessible financial research, data, 
and advice, including from governmental 
and regulatory bodies that help investors 
investigate brokers and potential 
investments and from hundreds of 
websites, blogs, YouTube channels, 
forums, and other outlets diving into 
T
aking control of personal finances 
and investing for a better financial 
future is something most people know 
is important. Many, though, never take 
the first step. Gallup data from 2016, in 
fact, shows only 52% of U.S. citizens are 
investing in stocks, including as part of 
their retirement funds. That compares 
to the roughly 65% of all Americans and 
nearly 75% of middle-class Americans 
who reportedly invested in stocks in 
2007. Today, Gallup reports only 50% of 
middle-class Americans own investments. 
A 2016 Bankrate.com survey shows 
similarly bleak conditions, particularly 
among millennials, with only a third 
reportedly owning stock. The reasons why 
people aren’t investing are pretty straight-
forward. In a 2015 survey, for example, 
Bankrate.com found 53% of those 
questioned reported they simply don’t 
have the money, while 21% reported 
they lack investment knowledge, 9% 
don’t trust stockbrokers, and 7% believe 
stocks are too risky. The good news is 
that financial experts seem to agree that 
with some sacrifice and learning, options 
exist to both get started in investing and 
improve personal financial situations. 
Seemingly every financial guru also 
agrees the time to act is now, as every day 
without action is another day of potential 
earnings wasted. 
Historically, investing generally meant 
paying a stockbroker or financial advisor 
significant fees and/or commissions to 
buy and sell on your behalf and provide 
personalized advice. Around the mid-
1990s, though, the internet helped 
foster the ability for individuals to invest 
for themselves online. Today, dozens 
of brokerages provide online trading 
platforms to buy and sell securities 
at discounted fees and commissions 
compared to traditional brokers or 
The internet has many blogs, websites, YouTube channels, and other outlets from various financial advisors, 
stockbrokers, personal finance gurus, and other financial experts who offer practical investing and money-
management advice. PT Money, which Philip “PT” Taylor founded in 2007, is one popular example.

check and set up automatic withdrawals 
from there to the various accounts. The 
general idea is to make savings hard to 
tap into by “setting up an imaginary wall 
between you and your savings accounts,” 
says Taylor, who specifically advises using 
“Set it up and forget about it,” he 
explains. First, ask your employer to split 
your paycheck into different percentages 
for direct deposit into separate bank, 
401(k), and IRA accounts, he says. If this 
isn’t possible, direct deposit the entire 
destructive natural human behaviors, 
the better,” he says. 
Arguably, there are so many financial-
related resources available online today 
that it’s intimidating for beginners 
to know where to start to change their 
financial situation. While it’s vital that 
any investor or someone making changes 
does her own research and works with 
trusted parties, the following offers advice 
to get started in online investing and 
better managing personal finances. 
It Makes Good Cents 
Much advice regarding online investing 
and personal finances stresses the 
importance of defining financial goals, 
doing the requisite research, and learning 
key financial terms to help navigate 
the financial waters you’ll encounter. 
Seemingly every financial expert also 
advises beginning by saving whatever 
you can starting immediately. Beyond 
helping create an emergency fund (the 
equivalent of six months’ salary is the 
general advice), Investopedia.com states 
that accumulating savings broadens your 
financial options, including the ability to 
start investing and putting your money to 
work for you over the long haul.
Getting started in online investing 
can take just $50 or less, but Rupert 
cautions that a big mistake seasoned and 
novice investors make is investing money 
they can’t afford to lose or investing in 
a manner not aligning with personal 
goals. “If you’re investing in a speculative 
manner, you have to be prepared to lose 
some or all of your investment,” he says. 
Sam Dogen, founder of the Financial 
Samurai blog, says that if what “you’re 
saving each month doesn’t hurt, you 
aren’t saving enough.” The sacrifice is 
“absolutely worth it,” he adds. Dogen 
himself lost 35% of his net worth in 
the 2008 financial crisis, only to recover 
and retire in his 30s a few years later. 
Today, technology is making it easier to 
oversee finances and help people save, he 
says. “Before, it was hard to track. Now, 
technology makes things easier,” he says. 
Taylor consistently recommends 
automating and separating your savings. 
10 Terms Of The Trade 
The investment and financial space has a seemingly infinite list of terms unique to that world. 
Fortunately, financial dictionaries are plentiful online. InvestorWords.com, for example, houses 
15,000 definitions for financial-related terms. Based on numerous such dictionaries, the following 
are 10 financial terms novices will eventually encounter. 
Bear and bull markets. Both terms can apply to essentially anything that’s traded. “Bear” 
signifies falling prices, while “bull” means the opposite. Further, investors can be “bearish” 
or “bullish” on specific stocks and companies. Remember, bulls jut their horns up, and bears 
swipe their claws downward. 
Blue chip. “Blue chippers” are typically larger, well-established companies regarded for 
their consistently solid performances in terms of their earnings and paying out dividends to 
stockholders.
Bonds. Investing in bonds essentially means loaning money to a company, government (think 
Treasury bonds), or other party that in turn promises to pay back the principal and interest. Buying 
bonds is generally considered a safe but low-return investment. 
Broker. Someone who buys and sells investments for an investor for a fee or commission 
and also provides personalized investment advice. Online brokerages that provide investors 
with online trading platforms to buy and sell through carry lower fees but typically offer far less 
personalized advice. 
Capital gain. The difference between what you buy an investment at and what it sells for is 
the capital gain (or loss). If buying a stock at $10 per share and selling it at $15, the capital gain 
is $5 per share. 
Dividend. Earnings a company makes and then distributes to shareholders. 
Exchange. The marketplace or platform used by buyers and sellers to trade financial 
stocks, commodities, bonds, and other financial assets. The New York Stock Exchange is one 
of several exchanges. 
Margin. Money an investor can borrow from his brokerage firm to buy bonds, stocks, or other 
securities. Typically, cash and/or securities in the customer’s account is used as collateral. 
Mutual fund. Rather than buy shares individually, a mutual fund enables investing in a 
portfolio of assets (typically various stocks, bonds, and other investments) overseen by a 
professional portfolio manager. 
Stock. A small slice of ownership. Buying stock in a company essentially means you own a 
fraction of the company. As the company’s performance goes, so too goes the stock’s value.

401(k) and IRA accounts for retirement 
savings. He also advises using online-only 
savings accounts such as FNBO Direct or 
Capital One 360 for short-term savings 
goals. “These accounts don’t come with 
a debit or credit card, and transfers 
from these accounts to your other bank 
account take a few days, lessening the 
chance that you’ll tap into them readily.”
Even with savings in place, fear will 
keep many people from trying their 
hands at online investing. “Not knowing 
how to start investing, a new investor 
will imagine it will be complex and shy 
away from starting out,” says Richard 
Smith, a contributor to The Motley Fool. 
Once committed, though, most people 
discover this isn’t nearly the case, he 
says. “Remember, online brokers want 
you to invest your money with them. 
To facilitate that, they’re going to make 
setting up an account as easy as possible,” 
he says.
Smith recommends initially just 
opening an account with an online 
brokerage and putting money in it. “Sit 
and watch it for a few weeks. Only after 
you feel comfortable with the account 
‘being there’ should you begin using it,” 
he says. “Buy a few shares of the S&P 
500 index or an ETF [exchange-traded 
fund] representing it. Watch it grow in 
value over time. Watch it outperform the 
rest of the account, which is just earning 
interest at money market fund rates. 
Then, buy a stock or three. Compare 
how they perform relative to the S&P 
500 index. Take it slow, and build up 
your confidence.” 
Beyond accumulating savings, 
compiling a core set of go-to financial 
resources for guidance, research, and 
data is also key for beginners. Taylor, for 
example, advises using RockstarFinance
.com for personal finance information 
and Bogleheads.org’s forums for investing 
information. In addition to his own 
FinancialMentor.com website, financial 
advisor Todd Tresidder recommends 
MrMoneyMustache.com for its 
frugality-based information. Tresidder 
also recommends “Think and Grow 
Rich,” a “must-read classic” he’ll read to 
A Word Of Warning: Know The Risks 
As Richard Smith, a contributor at The Motley Fool, says, the “information-everywhere” dream 
that investors once had is now reality. “From easy access to SEC [Securities and Exchange 
Commission] filings via EDGAR [Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval] to free data 
aggregators like Morningstar to free online screeners such as Finviz.com, it’s become a whole lot 
easier for investors to know what they’re buying these days,” Smith says. 
Unfortunately, technology has also made it easy for nefarious parties to run scams on investors, 
particularly beginners. Examples include so-called “pump-and-dump” schemes and other stock-
manipulation attempts that basically involve a scammer deliberately spreading misleading or false 
information about a security to get investors to bite on it to raise or lower its price. 
The Federal Trade Commission provides various advice at its site concerning scams, risks, and other 
issues associated with online investing. Chief among its advice is the importance of recognizing 
that any investment opportunity promising “low risk and high reward” is nearly always a fraud. The 
FTC recommends conducting research through such unbiased sources as the SEC; state securities 
regulators; and such self-regulatory organizations as FINRA, AMEX, and NASDAQ. “Never ever invest 
based solely on what you read in an online newsletter, bulletin board posting, or blog,” the FTC 
warns. In general, beware of companies that make grandiose claims concerning their new product 
developments, lucrative contracts, and financial health, the FTC cautions.  
Money-making investing schemes commonly entail multilevel marketing efforts (think pyramid 
schemes), business-opportunity promises, seminars that tout business and investment opportunities, 
internet startups; investments in gold, collectible coins, and bullion; government grant scams (or 
“money for nothing” offers); and false and bloated claims about an invention’s potential. 
Like Smith, the FTC recommends using EDGAR to investigate potential investments. To sell securities 
legally, sellers must register with the SEC or qualify for an exemption. Consulting EDGAR can help in 
situations when a fraudulent seller may claim to be SEC-registered and even provide a contact person 
to verify it. The contact, however, is in on the scam. A free BrokerCheck tool at FINRA’s website lets you 
check brokers/brokerage firms concerning various investments. Among other information, BrokerCheck 
can help ID brokers who are no longer registered to trade securities but still work in the industry. 
“These individuals could still seek to gain the trust of potential investors,” FINRA states.
Other FTC advice includes 
knowing where securities 
are traded. Those traded via 
“over-the-counter” markets, for 
example, are among the most 
risky and prone to manipulation. 
Also be skeptical of pushy 
investment pitches that promise 
a big return if acting soon. 
Additionally, upon receiving a hot 
stock tip, ask how the tipper will 
benefit if you do invest. If you 
encounter someone or something 
worth pointing out, use the SEC’s 
Online Complaint Center. 
The EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) 
system from the SEC lets investors research various companies 
and investments they’re interested in, in part by looking through 
filings and disclosures made by companies. 
72 January2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

seeking a few key traits can help mitigate 
stress related to managing your own 
money. These include low fees; ensuring 
the online platform has a clean interface 
and intuitive access to balances, available 
cash, and other pertinent information; 
and quick access to basic charts 
concerning the historical performance 
of securities. 
As The Simple Dollar also notes, 
many online brokerages offer capabilities 
that stretch beyond trading securities 
to essentially make them “full-fledged 
trading, saving, investing, retirement 
planning, and banking machines.” A 
standout platform will provide quality 
trading tools and technology, different 
trading platforms for different levels of 
traders, excellent mobile trading features, 
and solid educational resources and 
research, The Simple Dollar writes.
Another key to selecting an online 
trading platform is ensuring you 
understand the brokerage’s fees. “Finance 
has a habit of making things harder to 
wealth. I view trading as more akin to 
gambling,” he says. 
As Rupert explains, investing is an 
attempt to profit from a company’s long-
term growth and prosperity, while trading 
is an attempt to profit from short-term 
fluctuations or opportunities regarding 
specific securities (stocks, bonds, mutual 
funds, etc.). If trading entices you, expect 
to spend considerable time learning to 
spot the fluctuations and opportunities 
Rupert mentions. Also know that while 
trading can generally bring greater 
financial reward, the risks are greater. 
Sometimes, Rupert says, a “get rich fast” 
trading mindset results in people “ready 
to swing for the fences without realizing 
they’re playing chess.” 
Eventually, beginning online investors 
will need to select an online trading 
platform, of which there are dozens from 
such online brokerages as TD Ameritrade, 
E-Trade, OptionsHouse, and Fidelity. As 
part of a comprehensive guide of online 
brokers, The Simple Dollar advises that 
his children one day because “it’s that 
good.” Similarly, Dogen advises reading 
about personal finances but from those 
who’ve actually studied and worked in 
the field and who’ve gained financial 
independence. “Your finances are too 
important to be left up to pontification,” 
he says. 
Also key to remember when starting 
out is that all the fintech and online 
information in the world can’t overcome 
poor personal financial habits. As 
Tresidder says, “investing and personal 
finance existed long before technology, 
and the principles that result in success 
have nothing to do with technology. 
Technology only changes the 
administration of a well-thought-out 
financial process and lowers the cost.” 
Online Investing ABCs
Even when standing on solid ground to 
begin investing online, many people will 
question if they should. Taylor believes 
everyone should at least consider it. 
“Whether you’re growing your wealth or 
preserving it, online investing tools make 
it easy and safe,” he says. Conversely, most 
people shouldn’t consider engaging in 
active trading with a majority of their 
portfolio, he says. “History has shown 
that humans are really bad at trying to 
beat the basic market returns. Invest for 
the long haul using diversified, low-cost 
funds inside tax-advantaged accounts,” 
he says.
Taylor’s advice touches on an 
important distinction anyone interested 
in investing must understand: the 
difference between “investing” and 
“trading.” As Smith says, one “invests” 
in businesses but “trades” stocks, with 
stocks essentially equating to fractional 
shares of a company. “The longer your 
time horizon, the more a serious investor 
should gravitate toward investing in 
businesses rather than merely trading into 
and out of stock tickers,” he says, adding 
that data proves stock market investments 
generate the greatest returns long-term. 
“Accordingly, I think everyone should 
consider online investing. Over long 
periods of time, it’s the best way to build 
Robo-advisors represent a newer investment option that has grown in popularity in recent years. 
Financial website NerdWallet describes a robo-advisor as “an online financial advisory firm that 
leverages automation and algorithms to help manage client portfolios.” The automation aspect enables 
such providers as Betterment to “offer investment management services to consumers for a fraction of 
the cost of a human financial advisor.” 
CPU  /  January2017 73

investing more efficient to save users 
time and increase their after-tax returns. 
Essentially, Betterment uses an investor’s 
personal financial situation and goals to 
make recommendations and automate 
various investment and management 
tasks “in a way that many traditional 
investment services can’t,” it states.
“Robo-advisors are good for investors 
looking to get started but don’t have 
a strong interest in learning about 
and understanding investing,” says 
Rupert, who adds that more intricate 
personal-financial situations likely do 
the major players are good. Focus your 
energy on the investment process, not the 
investment platform,” he says. 
A newer investment option to 
consider is using a “robo-advisor,” 
which one source described as making 
“investment management available to the 
masses.” Typically featuring low account 
minimums and intuitive interfaces, 
robo-advisors generally use algorithms 
to automate investing. Betterment is 
often cited for its robo-advisor approach. 
It claims it’s using technology to make 
“what has worked for decades” with 
understand than they actually have to 
be,” Rupert says. Smith says the several 
platforms he’s used over the years have 
all been perfectly acceptable. Initially, 
he advises selecting one that offers the 
best prices and incentives to open an 
account, and over time, don’t be afraid 
to switch providers to take advantage 
of new incentives. “There’s a learning 
curve to figuring out precisely how each 
platform works, but it’s not particularly 
steep,” he says. Similarly, Tresidder says 
online trading platforms have become 
a competitive, commodity service. “All 
The Gaming Way To Learn How To Invest
If you’re a millennial and aren’t investing, you’re hardly alone. Various 
studies indicate 20% or fewer have done so for reasons such as a lack of 
money to get started. Several newer companies, however, could change 
this lack of participation by appealing to millennials with features they’re 
comfortable with, including social-network-like communication, mobile 
apps, and gaming-centric approaches. 
Invstr, for example, states a mission to “make finance social by 
democratizing access to information and empowering everyone to take 
charge of their financial future.” Scutify, meanwhile, claims to be the 
most innovative social network for investors, traders, or those new to 
the markets. The company offers a Hedge Fund Manager game that lets 
players compete against other “Scutifiers” and “Scutify All-Stars.”
BUX, which claims 500,000 registered users, states that while the stock 
market essentially amounts to the “biggest and best game on Earth,” 
trading still remains inaccessible to many people often because investing 
is seen as too complicated, boring, and expensive. Thus, BUX’s mission is 
to make “stock trading exciting for everyone.” 
Kapitall also recognizes that investing can be confusing and 
intimidating. Given everything younger generations can spend money 
on, Kapitall states, it makes sense they aren’t investing as much as 
older generations. This doesn’t mean younger generations don’t care 
about their futures, “it just means preparing for retirement may not be 
the most important decision” on their plates. To steer them in a different 
direction, Kapitall uses a gaming-centric approach to investing, which 
is appropriate considering co-founder Gaspard de Dreuzy was a former 
console and PC game developer. Co-founder Serge Kreiker, meanwhile, 
previously developed tools for Bloomberg’s trading system. Launched in 
2012, Kapitall provides users (“Kapitallists”) a free account to acquire 
$100,000 in virtual currency to use toward building investing skills via a 
Practice Portfolio. 
Kapitall’s other nods to gaming include Koins (or 
virtual currency) that users accrue by performing 
various tasks such as sharing information with 
other Kapitallists, playing investing-oriented 
games, leveling up, and exploring Kapitall’s 
website. Users can use those Koins to buy actual 
merchandise in the Kapitall Store. Elsewhere, 
Kapitallists can acquire Tournament Portfolios 
and virtual currency to compete against others in 
monthly competitions for actual cash, and when a 
Kapitallist feels confident enough to make actual 
investments, she can via a Live Portfolio feature, 
with Kapitall making a $7.95 commission 
per trade. 
To help reduce complexity and confusion, Kapitall takes such 
measures as displaying a tradeable company’s logo vs. its often more 
confusing ticker symbol. Additionally, numerous functions are drag-
and-drop easy, including making investments from the platform’s 
Playground area.
Kapitall is one of several services that use a gaming-style approach to help people learn about 
and get familiar with online investing before making actual investments, which users can also do 
through Kapitall.

can cloud your mind and alter decision-
making skills.”
Outside of simulators, other fintech 
tools to explore include scores of mobile 
apps, many of which provide convenient 
and powerful capabilities. Smith tabs 
Robinhood, for example, as “pretty nice 
little app for basic investing.” Offering 
free trades, Robinhood is regarded as 
being well-suited for newer investors 
and for doing away with expenses other 
brokerages charge. Stash Invest is another 
app geared toward millennials. It’s a micro 
robo-advisor that uses a “start small, think 
big” approach that enables investing for as 
little as $5 in an effort to encourage users 
to learn and grow into bigger investments. 
Other web- and app-based services 
commonly cited for their quality are 
FinMason, which helps investors measure 
their risk tolerance; Morningstar, which 
offers a wealth of current investment-
related information; Acorns, which 
connects to a user’s financial accounts 
and cards to round up normal purchases 
to the nearest dollar and automatically 
invest that “spare change”; Digit, a similar 
service that uses small amounts of spare 
money to grow wealth; Wealthfront, a 
robo-advisor that is well-regarded for its 
investment-management capabilities; 
YNAB (You Need A Budget), which 
helps improve budgeting skills; Mint, a 
free budgeting and management service; 
EveryDollar, which aims to put all your 
dollars to work; GnuCash, personal 
budgeting software that supports 
numerous OSes, including Linux; and 
Personal Capital, which helps manage 
a user’s financial portfolio and provides 
investment guidance. 
In addition to those services, there 
are many investment, budgeting, money 
management, and other personal finance 
blogs and educational resources, including 
Yahoo! Finance, CNN Money, Get Rich 
Slowly, FiveCentNickel, The Reformed 
Broker, NerdWallet, Financial Ducks In A

present actual investing elements to help 
prepare you, including charging broker fees 
and commissions, which Investopedia.com 
notes can significantly impact an investor’s 
bottom line. As a veteran investor, Smith 
tends to use simulators (“I’m partial to 
caps.fool.com, of course”) “more as 
a shopping list of ideas that I can refer 
back to when deciding which stock to buy 
next,” he says.
Rupert cautions that simulators can be 
a scary precursor to actually investing, as 
most simulators provide users large sums 
of virtual money (even $1 million). “This 
isn’t realistic for most investors looking 
to use a simulator to test the waters,” he 
says. “You won’t find all the emotions 
of investing while using a simulator—
it isn’t real money. This is important 
because behavioral finance is a critical 
concept for investors to be aware of that 
require input from a seasoned financial 
professional. Most robo-advisors, he 
says, currently only focus on creating 
low-cost portfolios with an emphasis on 
asset allocation. Dogen also sees robo-
advisors as making a real difference for 
people uncertain of where to start and 
those who don’t want to pay traditional 
advisor fees. “If you had started 
investing with a robo-advisor in 2012, 
your equities would be up close to 60% 
by now vs. little gains holding in cash,” 
he says. 
Tools Of The Trade 
Whether you’re interested in investing 
or getting a better grasp on your personal 
financial situation, an ever-growing list 
of tech tools, including mobile apps 
and online services, are available to 
provide assistance. As Tresidder notes, 
though, it’s important to remember that 
investing and personal finance have been 
around much longer than technology. 
The principles that result in success have 
nothing to do with technology, Tresidder 
says. “Technology only changes the 
administration of a well-thought-out 
financial process and lowers the cost.” 
Dogen makes an important point that 
while someone with the interest, time, 
and patience to learn how to invest, 
allocate assets, and watch their money can 
do everything a financial advisor can do, 
many people lack these traits. Thus, he 
recommends seeking a fee-only financial 
advisor to help get started vs. a financial 
advisor who will charge 1 to 3% of your 
assets being managed. Dogen provides a 
free “Do It Yourself Investment Checkup 
Guide” to help. “If you can’t figure it 
out or are still uncomfortable with the 
process, then it may be a good idea to 
speak to a professional,” he says. 
For those determined to try online 
investing but want to gain some experience 
first, some experts recommend using an 
investment simulator, which provides 
virtual currency to practice with before 
making actual investments. Investopedia
.com, for example, has a stock market 
game that provides $100,000 in virtual 
currency. Overall, simulators typically 
Acorns claims more than 1 million have used its 
service, which is billed as a “micro” investing 
platform. Upon connecting bank accounts and 
cards to the service, Acorns rounds up normal 
purchases you make to the nearest dollar, 
automatically investing the spare change.

Call Of Duty In Space
BY CHRIS TRUMBLE
$59.99 (PC, XOne, PS4)   •   ESRB: (M)ature
Activision   •   www.callofduty.com
My last doorway to the Call of Duty world opened a year ago with 
the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, and in addition to being 
blown away by that game (pun intended), I wondered how Activision 
could live up to the ridiculously high bar it had set. Call of Duty: 
Infinite Warfare is the answer to this question, and it doesn’t just 
raise the bar—it launches that bar into the sun. 
Infinite Warfare is digital nirvana for fans of sci-fi- and military-themed 
shooters for lots of reasons, including amazing visuals and sound 
effects, multiplayer that is quite possibly the pinnacle of the genre, the 
best CoD campaign ever, a cool Zombies sub-game, and a metric ton 
of cool features and options. In truth, there’s so much to do and see 
in this game that it’s almost paralyzing; in preparing for this review, I 
wanted very badly to play online multiplayer and I wanted to play the 
campaign, but I only have two hands and one brain stem.
Of course, multiplayer is what drives Call of Duty games and 
keeps millions of people playing each game all year until a new 
one comes along, and Infinite Warfare will be no different. The 
levels are huge and highly detailed, the action is fast and insanely 
fun, and the customization and player progression systems are so 
engrossing that you will at some point actually find yourself getting 
mad that the next match is starting because you’re having that 
much fun messing around with loadouts and personalization stuff.
But don’t forget to play this campaign. Infinity Ward really pulled 
out all the stops on it, and it’s the polar opposite of the brief, almost 
perfunctory campaigns that used to accompany CoD titles. The 
story is really cool, and although it relies on a fairly silly conceit to 
do so, it gives you pretty much everything you could ask for as a 
player. Your character, a spec ops fighter pilot named Nick Reyes, 
is both an accomplished commando and a crack fighter pilot, and 
after the game kicks off with a dramatic attack by the villainous 
SDF (Settlement Defense Front), also becomes the acting captain of 
a space carrier named Retribution. 
Obviously, even in a time of war and up against drastic 
circumstances, no one person would ever attempt to (or be allowed 
to) fill all of those roles, but as it turns out, taking the story in this 
direction was a stroke of genius. You get to play excellent FPS 
missions and very good fighter combat missions, and you get to 
take command of a massive, futuristic warship and choose what 
missions you play and when.
As the first CoD game to slip the surly bonds of Earth, Infinite 
Warfare lets you do it all, and in the process makes it very easy to 
work in futuristic weapons, cool AI characters, and hot shooter stuff 
like wall running and such, all without straining the narrative a bit. 
This game is a must-own for sci-fi shooter fans. ■
Yeah, we know you have blogs to post, video to encode, reports to write, and code to compile. We do, 
too, but you have to take a break once in a while (and maybe blow some stuff up). That’s why each 
month we give you the lowdown on what to expect from the latest interesting games.

Bearded Warriors 
Wielding Bearded Axes

THQ Nordic   • www.dwarves-game.com
In many great works of fantasy, storytelling is an integral part of the 
story. Whether it’s the world-weary bard singing tales of his travels in 
a seedy inn at the edge of the world or the centuries-old high priestess 
passing down ancient mysteries to a promising acolyte, legend and lore 
help shape the Westeroses and Middle Earths we love so much. So, our 
review of THQ Nordic’s The Dwarves begins with a story.
Strange as it might seem, The Dwarves has a couple of things in 
common with a game it ought to have precisely zero shared attributes: 
Metro 2033. Both games are THQ properties, and both are based on 
novels from Eurasian authors. Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky penned 
“Metro 2033,” while German author Markus Heitz wrote “The Dwarves.”
Developers at KING Art Games loved Heitz’s book so much that 
they decided to turn it into an epic RPG. KING Art Games took to 
Kickstarter for funding to fill the game with 
all the features on its wish list. Backers 
received access to the alpha and beta, but 
now all of us are able to grab our weapons 
and slash/bludgeon/fireball our way through 
swathes of bloodthirsty orcs.
The least spoilerific spoiler of the year: 
You begin The Dwarves as a dwarf named 
Tungdil Bolofar. The earnest Groundling, as 
they’re derisively called in-world, takes to 
smithing like a fish to water, naturally, but 
his love of books and learning might make 
him the first nerdy dwarf in all of fantasy. It 
doesn’t take long before Tungdil’s adoptive 
father of sorts, the human magus Lot-Ionan, 
sends Tungdil on an errand that begins his hero’s journey, and in 
short order Tungdil finds out that there are plenty of other dwarves 
left in the world of Girdlegard. (Shocking, we know.) With help from a 
handful of Unlikely Allies, Tungdil endeavors to save the realm from 
the nefarious Dark Wizard.
Party members come, go, and come back, but The Dwarves’ combat 
system remains the same throughout. KING Art Games delivers a 
reasonably tight tactical action RPG, rewarding you for pausing the 
action—perhaps a little too frequently—to maximize the impact of 
your characters’ abilities. The game’s camera rarely feels perfect, and 
a rather shallow inventory makes The Dwarves more of an RPG Lite 
in truth. On the other hand, the physics-based “brawler” elements are 
fresh enough that The Dwarves’ shortcomings are forgivable.
Voice acting is quite good, and the graphics are decent if unspectacular. 
The Dwarves owes an immense debt to Tolkien, of course, and yet the 
story has enough heart to keep us playing. Fans of Heitz’s novels will 
undoubtedly dig The Dwarves more than anyone else, but if you’re up 
for a serviceable RPG with lots of good old-fashioned high fantasy, this 
game is a heaping helping of comfort food. The $40 price tag puts it 
in the same class as heavyweights such as Skyrim and The Witcher 
3, though, so we wouldn’t blame you for greedily keeping your vault 
locked and waiting for a sale or discount. After all, no self-respecting 
dwarf would fault you for trying to save a little gold. ■

Cry “OK Google” 
& Let Loose The Dogs Of War
BY ANDREW LEIBMAN
$59.99 (PC, XOne, PS4)   •   ESRB: (M)ature
Ubisoft Montreal   •   www.ubisoft.com
Watch Dogs 2 is an open-world sandbox-style game that will be 
instantly familiar to anyone who has played the first game, or any of 
the recent GTA, Saints Row, Just Cause, or Mafia games. All of these 
games are effectively third-person world simulators, complete with 
hundreds of NPCs milling around, dozens of miles of realistically 
rendered city and rural landscapes, a vast array of vehicles, massive 
arsenals of weaponry and gadgets, day/night cycles, and dynamic 
weather systems. As with other open-world games, Watch Dogs 2 
gives you multiple options for completing missions: you can go in guns 
blazing or sneak through the back door. The player character also has 
a wickedly fun drone and radio-controlled buggy to disable security 
systems, create distractions, and neutralize threats.
Compared to those other games, and even the original Watch Dogs, 
this game gets a lot right. The hook for this series is that, as the 
protagonist, you are an elite hacker living in a near-future city (this 
time it’s San Francisco) where an evil corporation has total control over 
an all-seeing and all-knowing software network that it uses to track, 
manipulate, and ultimately oppress the citizens therein. This Internet of 
Things on crack, called ctOS 2.0, isn’t just your nemesis, it’s also your 
primary means of sabotage, subterfuge, and revenge.  
As Marcus Holloway, you can whip out your smartphone to script your 
way into and out of numerous hairy situations, for instance by changing 
street lights green, rupturing gas valves, exploding transformers, 
remotely hijacking and controlling cars, unlocking high-security doors, 
and more. Sure, you can play through Watch Dogs 2 much like you 
would GTA, by shooting up everything in sight, but it’s so much more 
satisfying to use ctOS against your foes. The non-violent options are a 
nice change of pace, especially considering the fact that many of the 
people who oppose you are unwitting victims of the system. 
But there’s a tone problem in Watch Dogs 2. After being able to rely 
on stealth for a majority of the game, it suddenly vetoes that freedom. 
I enjoy piloting a chain-gun-armed robot spider as much as the next 
guy, but the moment feels more like a videogame trope than something 
Marcus would do. More to the point, Marcus vacillates between 
expressing sympathy for the duped masses and using his 1337 h4x0r 
skillz to steal money, information, and cars from the same “sheeple.” 
We love how lighthearted Marcus and his fellow DedSec anarchists are 
early on, but—without wanting to spoil anything—the game veers hard 
from this mentality midway through and then attempts to veer back 
toward the end. It makes for an awkward transition. 
The game has some flaws, but overall, hacking our way through San 
Francisco is enjoyable—significantly more so than with Aiden Pearce 
in Chicago, a la the original Watch Dogs. The best part of this game, 
however, is that it actually has something to say about our vanishing 
privacy, shrinking security, and increasingly constrained freedoms, and 
how we’re so willing to click the Agree button because an infinitely 
connected future is just so darned convenient. OK, Google, can I have 
my privacy back?
Ubisoft Montreal deserves props for making the PC version feel like a 
premium offering. There’s a high-resolution texture pack and more than 
20 settings that let you tweak image quality. If your hardware can hack 
it, Watch Dogs 2 can look pretty amazing. ■

It’s A HIT, Man
BY ANDREW LEIBMAN
$59.99 (PC, XOne, PS4)   •   ESRB: (M)ature
IO-Interactive   •   www.square-enix.com
Back in our May 2016 issue, we reviewed the latest installment of the 
HITMAN franchise, and although we loved IO-Interactive’s open-world 
murderfest, we were rather put off by the game’s episodic release 
schedule. The developers effectively chopped up the game and doled 
out the bits as they finished working on them. Eight months after the 
initial release, the full game is now playable, and we can finally deliver a 
definitive review of the complete package. 
A lot of what makes HITMAN great is present in that Intro Pack, which 
includes the Paris mansion level. The first time you play through a mission, 
you get the story cutscene, a short list of targets (usually two, but up to 
four), and a slew of additional objectives that crop up organically as Agent 
47 slinks around what amounts to a Hobby Lobby designed for people 
whose only hobby is killing people. These mini objectives are designed 
to get you close to one of the targets and nudge you in the direction of a 
particular kill method. Executing them flawlessly will net you bonuses, as 
will finding tidbits of intel that tie into the game’s narrative. They even result 
in unique animations. One such event had us tossing an ailing target’s 
donor heart into a waste bin. Nothin’ but net. For each target, you’ll typically 
only get to perform a single kill objective, so you’ll need to go back again 
and again to see them all play out. And for the most part, you’ll want to. 
There’s real replay value in retrying the missions to see how wacky things 
get, and although it’s also fun to blaze your own trail from time to time, 
nothing feels better than being able to walk calmly away from the murder 
scene without ever raising an eyebrow. Subsequent playthroughs get 
even more interesting thanks to the weapons, stash points, disguises, and 
starting locations you unlock with the points earned during the mission. 
For $60, however, we expect a complete experience, and that wasn’t 
available until late October. The Complete First Season, as it’s currently 
being referred to, finally feels like a whole game. The episodes that 
followed the Intro Pack each serve as missions in a single exotic location, 
including a coastal Italian-inspired village called Sapienza, a market 
packed with hundreds of milling NPCs and an embassy in lockdown in 
the Moroccan city of Marrakesh, a luxury hotel in Bangkok, a remote 
militia training facility in Colorado, and a high-tech private hospital in 
Hokkaido, Japan. Each playground offers unique opportunities to blend in 
and challenges to overcome, and they’re all fun places to kill bad guys.
The story side of HITMAN is a little thin, but as we went to press, we 
caught word that IO-Interactive is planning to move forward with a 
Season Two, which will hopefully amount to some real developments 
instead of more of Season One’s tail-chasing. The game is massively fun, 
which is why we’re so willing to forgive the slow-burn story elements. 
Much has been said elsewhere about HITMAN’s always-online 
requirement, and we’ll agree it’s wholly unnecessary for this 
exclusively single-player game. On one occasion, the servers weren’t 
responding, keeping us from being able to log in and play the game at 
all. What will happen a few years from now, when the servers are shut 
off? We’re thinking no amount of disguises or concealed tactical pistols 
will get 47 out of that bind. 
But, for now at least, we are confident that fans of stealthy sandbox 
games where you play as James Bond’s bald American alter ego will be 
very happy with this fully realized HITMAN. ■

Q&A With Nathan Bashaw 
Bringing To Life A New Format 
For Mobile Storytelling 
get into, although you can also slide to go 
back and that sort of stuff. There are some 
nuances to the way it works, but the core of 
it is you just tap and it animates it into the 
next thing.  
Q
: Interacting with Hardbound 
stories produces this strange feeling 
that you’re experiencing something 
entirely new but very familiar. How 
do you describe Hardbound and the 
storytelling experience it provides?
NB
: That’s a great question because 
it’s something that we’ve spent a 
lot of time trying to figure out, and I don’t 
know if we have a great answer for it. What 
I usually do if I’m physically with someone 
and I’m trying to explain Hardbound is 
say, “It’s a new format for storytelling, and 
it’s really visual and active and animated. 
It’s really made for mobile.” That’s about 
all I say, and then I show it to them. I feel 
like it’s one of those things that’s a little 
story. It shows you the first page and you 
just see some image or text or visual and you 
just tap and it shows you the next thing. 
You just keep tapping, and every time you 
tap there’s an animation between the page 
you’re currently on and the next one. There’s 
some combination of visuals, animations, 
text, graphics, maybe data visualizations, 
maps, really anything. Just tap, and it shows 
you the next thing. That’s the rhythm you 
Q
: Can you describe what the 
Hardbound experience is like through 
your eyes, from the point of opening the 
app to swiping through pages?  
NB
: That’s a good question. I’ve never 
been asked that actually. When you 
open the app, you see a bunch of stories that 
you can read, and each story is like a little 
square that has a title and a picture and tells 
you a little something about what’s inside 
it. Right now, all those stories you see are 
a part of what in the future we’ll just call 
“Hardbound Weekly.” So that’s just one 
kind of channel that we’re making. The 
second channel is the “Nightcap,” which is 
a different kind of channel that isn’t in the 
app yet but that’s a different kind of story. 
Eventually, there might be many channels. 
You might have a view that’s like “Your 
Channels” that you subscribe to. But for 
now, you just see the ones that are in the 
Hardbound Weekly, and you can tap one 
of those stories and it zooms you into that 
In the lead-up to creating Hardbound, CEO and Co-founder Nathan Bashaw and his colleagues asked themselves what storytelling 
might look like if, rather than creating a story with print in mind and then porting it to an ebook format as authors and publishers 
have traditionally done, they instead created stories with mobile screens specifically in mind. Doing so would enable taking 
advantage of a software-driven environment and all the abilities that computers afford. Essentially, Bashaw and company have 
created a “new form of media” with Hardbound. Twitter and Medium Founder Evan Williams has expressed his love for the format 
and hailed it as pushing the boundaries of mobile storytelling. 
While downloading Hardbound’s free mobile app is the best way to understand the storytelling experience it’s bringing to life, 
think of Hardbound stories as super-charged slideshows that put text, comics, animations, and other visual elements to excellent, 
innovative use. Oddly, the interactive storytelling experience that Hardbound presents feels entirely new and completely familiar. 
To date, Hardbound’s creators have created stories focused on “edutainment” topics, or material that’s both educational and 
entertaining. Soon, the company plans to open its content-creation tool to anyone, which could result in new types of content. We 
spoke with Bashaw—who also co-founded Product Hunt and created Dash, an interactive online book that thousands have used 
to learn how to create websites—about Hardbound, mobile storytelling, and more.

transferred and you’re doing an activity, 
like moving your eyes across lines of text. 
There’s some other stuff going on, like if 
you’re reading off a screen, studies have 
shown you’re kind of engaging with the 
text in a different way where you’re maybe 
a little more distracted and you probably 
have trouble remembering it in the same 
way. Your attention span is a little shorter. 
These are all basically different ways of 
downloading information that are good at 
some things but maybe not as good at other 
things. Like if you just watch a video of two 
people talking, after a while it gets boring 
because you don’t really need the video. It 
turns out podcasts are a great medium for 
that because you can do whatever else, like 
fold the clothes or take a walk or go to the 
gym or something. You don’t need your 
eyes, so it only uses the channels it needs. 
To me, with the format of Hardbound, 
we wanted to create something that you 
can learn more in a faster period and stay 
engaged better by how this information is 
presented. It’s the way your brain works 
better. There are a couple of principles 
of psychology—we kind of realized 
some of this after the fact, some of it was 
that couldn’t be printed or be shown on a 
television. YouTube could be put on your TV 
really easily; it’s basically the same thing, but 
it starts to get more and more different the 
further and further out we get into the future. 
I think Hardbound is maybe a step in 
that progression in an attempt to see if you 
could create a media company or platform 
that media companies can use that’s a really 
brand new format, where you explicitly set 
out to create a new format. That was what we 
spent really the first six to nine months of our 
company on—figuring out what the format 
should be. We went through a lot of ideas 
and a lot of our initial thinking was wrong 
and some of it was right, and it just took 
learning. We focused a lot on that at first.  
Q
: In talking about Hardbound, 
you’ve stated a desire to create a new 
form of storytelling that makes people 
feel awesome and “creates a super-high-
bandwidth connection between their 
phone and brain.” What does that mean?  
NB
: Bandwidth just means the rate of 
information transfer. When you’re 
reading text, certain information is being 
bit hard to explain. I also hesitate to use 
the word “slideshow,” because I think the 
connotations of the type of content you’d 
normally see in a slideshow isn’t something 
that we want to associate ourselves with 
so much. We really view the content we 
create for this format as something closer 
to something you might find in a podcast 
or magazine article. When you think of a 
slideshow, you normally think of sentence 
fragments and a bunch of bullet points or 
maybe a chart or something. Our content 
is just not really like that, although it is 
based on the idea of a slideshow where 
there’s a sequence of images essentially that 
combine words and images and sometimes 
animation. But the way we’re using it is just 
so different than something you might find 
on SlideShare that I try not to use that. But 
it’s not a bad anchor point, I guess.
Q
: You left your job on your 26th 
birthday citing a need to answer a 
question that had been nagging you: 
“What if books were designed for 
screens?” Why that particular question?
NB
: The goal of books, the job to be 
done, is transferring knowledge or 
transferring experiences maybe in the more 
broad sense. I’ve just always loved that. I 
love books. I love watching movies. I love 
reading. The thought to me that a lot of 
what we consume are digital recreations 
of formats of media that were created in 
response to the capabilities and constraints 
of analog media is just—when I feel I 
realized that, I was like, “Wow.” It will take 
a while, but people will probably invent 
new things in the context of the devices that 
we actually use now and that are designed 
for them rather than just continue to use 
the internet and computers as a distribution 
layer that plugs into the exact same 
production and supply chain and activity as 
media creators have always done. 
The job of a journalist has changed a lot, 
mostly because it’s gotten faster, but also with 
the actual content they’re creating. You can 
print—and people do print—the stories 
they make, and I think that will continue 
for a long time, but I also feel there’s a lot 
of opportunity for new stuff to get made 
The Hardbound format is based on the idea of a slideshow, where words combine with images, 
animation, and other visuals to tell a story.
CPU  /  January2017 81

a lot of tech companies do, where there’s 
a minimal standard that you have to meet 
where the content is basically not abusive 
or pornographic or something like that. 
That doesn’t mean everything on here has 
to be good, but that being said, it is critically 
important that when users open up the app, 
they’re presented with things that they’re 
going to love. If nobody loves it, we probably 
shouldn’t show it to that many people. So 
I’m really concerned about that, but it’s a 
different question. It’s not, “Should it be 
on here at all?” It’s, “Just how prominently 
should it be displayed and to whom?” That 
feels like a more solvable problem almost. 
You can make product decisions that help 
surface the best things to the people who 
are going to want it the most rather than 
thinking about it like it shouldn’t be listed on 
here or be included at all. 
Q
: How far along is Hardbound now 
compared to where you believe it 
can end up? 
NB
: We just want to make this really 
cool thing that provides a lot of 
value to a lot of people. The sky is kind of the 
limit. You can imagine it being an enduring, 
lasting company that adds a lot of value to a 
lot of people’s lives, but I don’t even know if 
it’s useful to think about that because it’s so 
far away from us. The goal is to be as great as 
it can possibly be. If you imagine the things 
of the past, there have been some pretty 
amazing things, so it has shown what was 
possible. And I also don’t think we’ve seen 
what the biggest, best company on Earth 
can look like. I don’t think necessarily bigger 
is better, but there’s probably more possible 
than what has been done. 
I think we’ll be on track if a couple of 
years from now, like what’s happened with 
podcasts in the past five years, if Hardbound 
sort of feels like that, where it’s a form of 
storytelling that’s new but familiar and there’s 
a lot of great stuff being created for it by 
individuals and media companies and it 
is just something that a lot of people are 
starting to enjoy. So even if we can do that, it 
would be a huge thing. But if we can do that, 
then we’re in a position to do a lot more. I 
wouldn’t define that as the stopping point. ■
with existing technology that a lot of 
people use. I think VR is another example 
of a new medium, and a lot of companies 
are working on VR. There’s a lot of hype. 
Hardbound is kind of a weirder, unique 
thing without as much hype but hopefully 
becomes something a lot of people like.  
Q
: You wrote that one goal for 
Hardbound is becoming a platform 
on which creators, such as novelists, 
podcasters, journalists, and educators, can 
aim high. Is there a fear that Hardbound 
could inspire similar platforms featuring 
content with less lofty ambitions?
NB
: It’s interesting because where I 
sit now, that would be the greatest 
problem to have—that there’s just a ton 
of stuff that gets created for it and there’s 
some stuff that I don’t like. From where I sit 
right now, I’m not afraid of that at all. If that 
actually happened, how I feel about it might 
be a little bit more viscerally different, but 
I kind of take the perspective that probably 
intentionally baked in—that explain why 
it feels good to read a Hardbound story. 
The first one is progressive disclosure, 
which basically means if you, say, have 
three things to tell someone, if you show 
them all three things at once they won’t 
comprehend it or remember it as well as 
if you show them one at a time. It’s really 
simple. You focus people by showing them 
a smaller amount of information at any 
given time. I think Hardbound does that 
well, and that’s one of the reasons why it’s 
good. We show a little bit of information 
at a time, and it just focuses you. 
Another is visual primacy. So, 25% of 
your brain is just pure visual-information 
processing, and I think it’s the biggest 
zone of the brain. We’re just really good at 
recognizing objects, recognizing motion. Part 
of what we started to do in the Hardbound 
app, and it works really well, is when you 
tap and it animates to the next slide, the 
way the motion is designed kind of guides 
your eyes to where the next text is going to 
be. It feels really smooth. We started doing 
that more explicitly. That kind of stuff just 
happens at such a deep level in your brain. 
Just seeing faces, like seeing processing in 
motion, getting the lay of the land through a 
map or something, or seeing a setting. 
In one of the news stories in The 
Nightcap [essentially a channel of content], 
basically the president of Syria did a rare 
interview from his palace, which is pictured. 
You see a picture of where he lives, his 
palace. That’s so much more meaningful 
than just imagining what it would be like. 
And you probably wouldn’t bother to 
look it up. But now you have such a more 
visceral understanding of what the palace 
actually looks like and what the news event 
was because you kind of picture it. 
I think visual primacy and progressive 
disclosure are some of the things that make 
Hardbound create a better connection. It 
takes the way your brain works and kind of 
designs around that using the screen as the 
constraint. VR, for example, is a different 
constraint but maybe feels even more like 
reality, but it’s also expensive because you 
have headsets and you’re also not in current 
reality. It asks a lot of you. Hardbound 
doesn’t ask quite as much, and it works 
Hardbound features “edutainment” articles 
covering various topics that should remain 
relevant for a long time.

Q&A With Julian Castro
Obey Alliance CEO 
On The Alliance & DXRacer
Being an organization with a foundation 
based on content creation, we look to 
really synergize Mike into our channel 
come 2017.
Q
: How many members does Obey have?
JC
: Obey currently has about 60 or 
more members. This is because 
of the different sections that have been 
developed in Obey to accommodate our 
content side. We have creators that develop 
specific forms of content, with lead directors 
managing each specific form. On top of 
content, we have developed our own design 
studio and video-editing team. This has 
created a well-oiled machine that constantly 
produces content and lays the foundation 
for what Obey is. Especially going 
into eSports, the design studio has been 
extremely essential, and we look forward to 
creating new opportunities in 2017 for all 
the hard-working creators in Obey.
Q
: What would you say is the No. 1 
reason people join Obey Alliance?
JC
: Obey is not only one of the 
biggest teams to look to join on 
YouTube, but our structure is the key 
reason for our success. Management 
works hard to work with our creators to 
help them grow and benefit from their 
passion. Given our size on YouTube and 
Twitter, we have the type of influence 
in our community to help grow any 
individual. Many creators have amazing 
talent. However, they need guidance on 
taking their passion to the next level. 
Obey is the place to be for creators that 
want a positive experience of growth 
Q
: Hi Julian! Can you explain what 
Obey Alliance is for readers who 
might not be familiar? What does Obey 
do, and how did it get started?
JC
: Obey Alliance is a gaming 
organization founded upon 
montage content from the popular FPS 
title Call of Duty. After years of content 
creation specifically on that platform, in 
2016 Obey has expanded to eSports as 
well as CS:GO and Battlefield content. 
Whilst still remaining true to the roots 
of our content, we look to expand and 
innovate as an organization into new and 
exciting games.
Q
: How many eSports teams and/or 
players do you currently have on 
the Obey roster?
JC
: Currently, about three months 
into our push to develop 
a solid eSports ground, there are two 
paths we have stepped into. One from 
SMITE, which actually just qualified 
for SMITE Worlds early this January. 
This was the first team we acquired and 
honestly has been a great experience. 
SMITE is an amazing community 
with passionate players and a strong 
support system through an outstanding 
company in Hi-Rez. When looking to 
find our next pickups in eSports, that 
is specifically what we look for: people 
with the same passion we all have 
for gaming, to work toward a similar 
goal. This led us to our second 
acquisition, Smash Melee Player Mike 
Haze. Mike is incredible; not only is he 
great in the competitive scene, but he 
creates great content during his off time.

JC
: Yes, the Obey Alliance chair is 
now finally available. It was a 
process, but the process was enjoyable 
given what we were working toward. 
DXRacer gave a chair design template 
to a designer in our organization. 
Once the chair was designed, finalizing 
colors and changes to the design took 
some time. Obey and DXRacer were 
always in contact during this process, 
and after a couple of months, we had 
a finalized product we were proud to 
have as Obey’s team chair.
Q
: Cool, thanks for your time! What’s 
the best place for readers to go 
for information about Obey if they’re 
interested in joining?
JC
: The best place to follow and 
look at new opportunities to be 
a part of our organization would be on 
Twitter (twitter.com/theobeyalliance), 
and if you want to stay updated on 
content, you can subscribe to our 
YouTube channel (www.youtube.com
/user/ObeyAlliance)! ■
Q
: How have Obey members 
responded to DXRacer, both in 
terms of the discounts you’ve worked out 
with the company, as well as with the 
chairs themselves?
JC
: Our members love DXRacer, 
and since our partnership 
with DXRacer has been so successful, 
we have been able to give product as 
rewards to creators that work hard every 
day to grow Obey and themselves. 
It is important for us to work with a 
brand that we know our members will 
love, and given DXRacer’s reputation, 
when this was originally released, 
everyone was ecstatic. DXRacer 
also has made amazing efforts to 
understand the content being produced 
and work with us on strategies for 
integration accordingly.
Q
: And you have also partnered 
with DXRacer on a custom 
Obey Alliance chair, right? How 
did that go down, and what was the 
process like?
with people who share their passion for 
creation and gaming.
Q
: So, you work with manufacturers 
to secure discounts to advertise 
to your fan base; what has Obey’s 
experience with DXRacer been like, and 
how did that start?
JC
: DXRacer has always been the best 
chair in the gaming community. 
This has been an established standard for a 
long time. When looking for new partners 
to develop with, we knew DXRacer would 
be a partner that Obey would love to 
have. DXRacer worked with our design 
studio to create advertising that optimally 
pushed DXRacer products to our fan 
base, not only through our platform on 
YouTube but also on Twitter.  Due to 
all these factors, our partnership with 
DXRacer has always been great. To work 
with a company that is run by individuals 
who take time to understand our process 
is a treat, and they have always worked 
with us to make the most out of our 
partnership together.
