Preface and mission of this textbook:
The textbook is addressed to students of applied geosciences and petroleum engineering. It is based on 
the experience I gained over a long time at different universities – Bergakademie Freiberg/Germany, 
Colorado School of Mines/USA, Montanuniversität Leoben/Austria and Technical University Graz/
Austria – and during various courses I prepared and teached for the industry.
Subject of the textbook are the fundamental techniques of well logging/borehole geophysics and the 
interpretation of the measured data. Practical examples help to understand different methods and 
algorithms. Exercises are designed to practice the methods and rules learned.
The user will get to know:
•	 The physical reservoir properties (porosity, saturation, fluids, permeability, capillary pressure).
•	 The physical background of well logging methods and the response with respect to reservoir 
characterization (physical principle and primary information from logging methods).
•	 Rules for optimal log combinations, basic equations and models, and fundamental techniques 
of log interpretation.
I thank Dr. Edith Müller-Huber for careful reading and correcting the text and Dr. Nina Gegenhuber 
for preparing Interactive Petrophysics Logplots, and I thank all my students for response, interest and 
patience during our classes.

Introduction

1.1	
History, present and future of a science and technology
In 1927 the Schlumberger brothers made the first electrical resistivity measurement in an oil well near 
Pechelbronn/Alsace. They called this new technology “electrical coring” or “electrolog”. The fundamental 
design of this new technology is still valid in our days:
--
Create a continuous plot of a measured property (resistivity) as a function of the (measured) 
depth and call it “the log”,
--
With the fundamental advantage of representing continuous information this log must be 
transformed into information for reservoir characterization (porosity, saturation) by a process 
called interpretation.
For quantitative interpretation petrophysical knowledge is necessary.The first step was done by Archie’s 
famous equations (Archie 1942), describing the correlation between specific electrical resistivities 
(measured properties), porosity, water saturation (derived properties) and empirical parameters:
where 
 is water saturation, 
 is the specific electrical resistivity of the formation, 
 is the specific 
electrical resistivity of the formation at water saturation 
 and is n Archie’s empirical 
saturation exponent.
A formation or reservoir characterization cannot be derived from one type of logs alone – it needs 
a combination of various physical parameters in order to derive a consistent model of the formation 
(complex interpretation).
The historical development of borehole geophysics is therefore characterized by the development of 
various systems with defined sensitivity. Cornerstones of the first period are:
--
Resistivity logs (first commercial logs), directed at water saturation determination for 
clean rocks,
--
Spontaneous Potential log, directed at the separation of sand (clean rock, reservoir) and shale,
--
Acoustic log, the only “porosity log” based on Wyllie’s equation (Wyllie et al. 1956) in the 
early days.

Introduction
With the advent of nuclear tools, a completely new family of logging tools comes to the fore. The 
Natural Gammalog becomes the log most frequently applied to estimate the shale content. With the 
Gamma-Gamma-Density- and the Neutronlog two powerful instruments are available to more exactly 
determine porosity as one of the key parameters. The presence of two (Densitylog and Neutronlog) or 
three (additionally Acousticlog) “Porosity logs” results in the development of sophisticated combined 
techniques for a porosity and mineral composition calculation.
On this way all tools have been developed and promoted for elimination of caliper effects, better 
resolution, and increased depth of investigation. Focusing tools (Laterolog) and Dual-System tools 
(Density, Neutron) are important levels of development and have been refined – based on the possibilities 
of digital processing – to different array systems. At the same time new techniques (sensors, data 
transmission) allow spectral measurements mainly for the nuclear techniques and for full-waveform-
registration of acoustic systems.
The increasing amount of input data and advanced data processing are only possible with digital 
techniques.
With the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technique a major step forward was done in order to 
derive pore space properties with respect to a permeability estimate and to realize fluid characterization. 
In the frequently used Coates equation (Coates and Dumanoir 1974; Coates et al. 1999) permeability in 
md (millidarcy) is derived as follows

BVI 	 is bulk volume fluid non-movable (irreducible),

C	
is also an empirical parameter generally between 6 and 15. 
This equation reflects the philosophy of Archie’s equation with a simple, physically understandable 
structure (based on a capillary model) and empirical parameters covering the complicated geometry 
and structure of the pore space in a fascinating way. And it teaches us that we need laboratory core data 
in order to determine these empirical parameters for the specific formation, or – with other words – to 
calibrate our tools.

Introduction
The long way of this development and the creation of interpretation tools is related to a specific 
environment: The tool is surrounded by mud in an (open) well; this classic type of logging is called 
“wireline technique”. But also in completed wells investigations are important for example for control 
of completion and quality (for example cement bond logs) and monitoring fluid saturation (this part of 
cased hole logging is not subject of this book).
The modern techniques of Measurement While Drilling (MWD) and Logging While Drilling (LWD) 
reflect the dream to “see” in real-time what is penetrated with the bit; such a measurement is important 
for an optimized and safe drilling operation also in deviated and horizontal wells.
1.2	
Fundamental problems and the way we go
Borehole geophysical measurements are an important group of methods for the solution of fundamental 
problems in:
a)	 Hydrocarbon exploration and production,
b)	 Exploration of water and geothermal resources,
c)	 Mineral exploration,
d)	 Geotechnical investigations,
e)	 And a variety of general problems in earth science.
For the dominant field of hydrocarbon exploration Figure 1-1 defines the fundamental questions with 
regard to locality, depth and geometry of the reservoir – in most cases this general model is derived 
from geological, sedimentological and structural studies implementing seismic and other surface 
geophysical results.
The drilled well gives a possibility to verify the expected geology, to determine exact bed depth and 
thickness, to indicate the lithology and mineralogy, and to show reservoirs or zones of interest. The 
step of quantitative determination of key properties (porosity, saturation, permeability) is subject of 
quantitative log analysis and implements parameters derived from cores.
Of increasing interest are monitoring and observation of changes of properties during the lifetime of a 
well. This is focused not only on the change of fluid saturation during production, but also directed on 
mechanical stability and the phenomenon of subsidence.

geotechnical problems.
Borehole geophysics or well logging takes measurements along the borehole in terms of physical properties 
(log data). The log data present a continuous documentation of the whole profile and give a physical 
characterization of the individual layers and sections in terms of resistivity, nuclear radiation etc.
Sophisticated interpretation methods transform the measured data into reservoir properties (porosity, 
saturation, permeability etc.) and other properties of interest.
Thus, there are two types of properties:
1)	 Properties of primary interest (porosity, saturation, permeability) – reservoir properties,
2)	 Properties delivered from the well logging tools (resistivity, nuclear cross section, acoustic 
traveltime or slowness, natural gamma radiation etc.) – log measured properties.
How can we derive equations and algorithms for a transformation of (measured) parameters into 
reservoir properties? 
There are three ways:
1)	 empirically, using experiments,
2)	 theoretically, using models,
3)	 combination of theoretical and empirical results.

Introduction
Since borehole measurements are realized in a disturbed or inhomogeneous environment (effect of 
borehole and caliper, invaded zone, layers above or below the measured section, dip of layers etc.), the 
original measured parameters are “apparent properties” and need a processing to eliminate these effects 
and to derive “true rock properties”. Therefore the whole process of borehole measurement includes the 
following steps (Figure 1-2):
1)	 Define the parameters of interest for the lithological type of the section. Design – based on 
the sensitivity of the individual methods/tools – your logging program.
2)	 Measure the corresponding logs. The result is a dataset for each method i. With regard to 
resistivity measurement, this could be Microlog, Laterolog-shallow, and Laterolog-deep.
3)	 Specific processing algorithms derive a physical model in terms of the measured physical 
property pi from these “apparent data”. Regarding resistivity measurements this results in the 
resistivity of the invaded zone ܴ௫௢ and the resistivity of the non-invaded (virgin) zone ܴ௧. This 
step is called “processing” and has a strong reference to the tool characteristics.
4)	 Interpretation methods transform measured data into reservoir properties (porosity, saturation, 
permeability etc.) and other properties of interest. Relationships between measured data and 
reservoir properties are an instrument of this “interpretation” process. It is important to note that 
important inputs are necessary for this step (e.g. information about lithology, fluid properties, 
empirical parameters like Archie’s m and n).

Reservoir Rocks, Reservoir Properties
2	 Reservoir Rocks, 
Reservoir Properties
This section describes the key properties needed for reservoir characterization of the two dominant lithologic reservoir 
types sandstone and carbonate rocks. Key properties are porosity, fluid saturation, and permeability. There are two ways 
of property measurement:
¾
¾ Direct at cores and plugs (this section)
¾
¾ Indirect from logs (following sections).
2.1	
Reservoir rock types
Fluids (oil, gas, but also water) are accumulated in the pore space of the reservoir rock. Therefore, the 
fundamental reservoir rock properties are:
•	 Porosity: How much space is available in the rock?
•	 Fluid type: Is it oil, gas, or water?
•	 Saturation: Which volume fraction of the pore space is occupied by oil, gas, and water?
•	 Permeability: At what rate can I produce a fluid?
For determination and derivation of these reservoir properties, there are two techniques:
Direct: Measurements on samples (cores) in core laboratories. The result refers to a limited volume 
(“point-information”),
Indirect: Parameters derived from logs (well log measurements, formation analysis). The result is 
continuous information presented as a curve, but not directly in terms of reservoir properties (porosity, 
permeability etc.). A transformation (interpretation) into reservoir properties is necessary. This involves 
a kind of “log calibration” (comparison with laboratory data or tests).
Therefore the combination of both techniques – core and log data – is essential for successful formation 
evaluation.
Reservoir rocks can be classified into two major types 
1)	 Clastic rocks (sandstone)
2)	 Carbonate rocks (limestone, dolomite)

Reservoir Rocks, Reservoir Properties
The two types have different pore properties, different abundances, and different importance for the 
world’s hydrocarbon production.
For a reservoir the “protecting or sealing formation” (cap rock) is also of critical importance. Thus the 
main subject of interpretation are the basic lithologies presented in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1 Basic lithologies considered in interpretation.
Clastic rocks: Typical members are sandstone, siltstone, claystone, and shale. The parameter used for 
classification of clastic rocks is grain size (Figure 2-2).

Figure 2-2: Classification of clastic sediments according to grain size; f: fine, m: medium, c: coarse. The terms 
psephites, psammites, and pelites are defined for more than 50% weight of the corresponding grain size range 
(Schön, 1996)
Clay has a strong influence on all rock properties; it decreases the effective pore space and reduces 
permeability.
The terms “clay” and “shale” are a source of confusion; please note:
•	 Clay is defined as a particle size ( < 0.002 mm),
•	 Clay minerals are a group of phyllosilicates with specific properties (Cation Exchange 
Capacity CEC),
•	 Shale is a rock type (high amount of clay minerals, but also fine-grained feldspars and quartz). 
The clay fraction in shale makes up about 40 … 90%. In many shale physical properties the 
properties of clay minerals are reflected.
For the effect of clay in a reservoir rock, not only the volume fraction (clay content) and the clay 
mineralogy, but also the type of clay distribution is important (Figure 2-3):
1)	 Laminar clay – thin clay layers alternating with sand,
2)	 Dispersed clay – clay in the pores (also authigenic clay),
3)	 Structural clay – clay forms grains and is a rock-building component.

Reservoir Rocks, Reservoir Properties
Carbonate: The principal minerals of carbonate reservoir rocks are calcite, dolomite, and minor clay. 
Secondary minerals are anhydrite, chert, and quartz. The pore space has a very complicated structure.
We distinguish two main carbonate reservoir rock types:
•	 Limestone is composed of more than 50% carbonates, of which more than half is calcite CaCO3,
•	 Dolomite is composed of more than 50% carbonates, of which more than half is dolomite 
CaMg(CO3)2.
A range of carbonate classification schemes exist: Dunham’s Classification of Carbonates is frequently 
used. It is based on the internal structure of the rock (Akbar et al. 1995, 2000/01). 
Table 2-1 shows a petrophysical classification of carbonate pore types (adapted from Lucia 1983, 2007).

Porosity
Porosity is defined as the volume fraction of all pores related to the rock bulk volume (Figure 2-5):
Vs
Vp
Pore p
1- φ
φ
Solid s
Figure 2-5: Definition of porosity.
Porosity is given as a dimensionless volume fraction or as a percentage.
For reservoir characterization it is important to distinguish between:
1)	 Total porosity (the fraction of bulk volume occupied by the total pore space or the space not 
occupied by solid components), 
2)	 Effective porosity (the fraction of bulk volume occupied by interconnected pore space allowing 
fluid flow). The non-effective part of total porosity is represented in clastic rocks by the clay-
bound water and in carbonates by non-connected pores or vugs.
Porosity can be determined:
•	 Directly at cores, plugs, or samples in the core-laboratory,
•	 Indirectly from logs (nuclear and acoustic measurements), and by NMR measurements.
2.3	
Fluids in the pore space: Saturation and bulk volume fluid
Porosity gives the pore volume related to the bulk rock volume. Saturation gives the volume fraction 
occupied by a fluid related to the pore volume1. Thus, saturation 
iS  describes the volume fraction of a 
fluid i in a porous rock:
Saturation is given as a dimensionless fraction or as a percentage. Saturation theoretically has the lower 
bound at zero (or 0%) and the upper bound at one (or 100%).
A reservoir hosting the fluids water, oil, and gas is characterized by three saturation terms; their sum 
must be 1:

Reservoir Rocks, Reservoir Properties
Fluid saturation can be determined:
•	 From cores, plugs, or samples (direct determination by fluid extraction, or capillary pressure 
measurements),
•	 Indirectly from logs (resistivity, dielectric, or neutron measurements).
In addition to the parameter “saturation”, the parameter “bulk volume of the fluid” is used. Bulk volume 
of a fluid i relates the volume of that fluid to the rock bulk volume. The bulk volume of, for example, 
water is therefore given by:
The bulk volume of a fluid theoretically has the lower bound zero and the upper bound given by total 
porosity.
In a (water wet) porous rock, the water, depending on its interaction with minerals and bonding type, 
is present as:
•	 Free movable water in the pore space (bulk volume movable BVM),
•	 Capillary bound water, connected with the grain surface (bulk volume immovable BVI), and
•	 Clay-bound water (CBW) with its strong clay-water effects.
The water types have different physical properties and effects (e.g. with respect to permeability or electrical 
resistivity). Therefore a subdivision into these types is necessary. 
Porosity and bulk volume of fluids describe the volumetric composition of a reservoir rock (Figure 26).

Permeability
Permeability
•	 characterizes the ability of a rock to transmit a fluid; it connects the fluid flow rate with the 
applied pressure gradient and the fluid viscosity,
•	 is controlled by the connected passages of the pore space (pore throats),
•	 is a tensorial property and exhibits, in many cases, an anisotropy (mostly expressed by horizontal 
(
) and vertical (
) permeability2).
Methods used to determine permeabilityare:
a)	 Direct measurements at samples (cores, core plugs),
b)	 Direct tests: well and drillstem tests, wireline formation testers, pump tests,
c)	 Indirect methods using grain size parameters and porosity (particularly for unconsolidated 
sediments),
d)	 Indirect methods using wireline logs and specific interpretation (NMR, Stoneley wave, or 
combined techniques implementing irreducible water saturation). 
Permeability relates the laminar fluid flow (fluid volume/time) to the macroscopic cross section of the 
rock, the viscosity of the fluid, and the fluid pressure gradient (Figure 2-7).

•	 Relative permeability (ratio of effective to absolute permeability).
The permeability has the unit of an area [m2] in SI units; this explains permeability as a pore geometrical 
measure. In the oil industry, Darcy (d) or millidarcy (md) are typical units used with the conversion
1 d = 0.9869 10-12 m2  or    1 d ≈ 1 µm2

Reservoir Rocks, Reservoir Properties
Permeability is a pore space property; main controlling factors are:
1)	 Porosity (connected porosity),
2)	 Pore size and fracture width; permeability is proportional to several powers (≈ 2) of pore size 
or fracture width. 
Permeability increases with porosity (see Figure 2-8) and pore (throat) size. If rock contains clay, 
permeability can decrease by orders of magnitude. 
Figure 2-8: Permeability versus porosity (poro-perm correlation) for sandstone 
In clastic sediments, the correlation between permeability and porosity is one of the most concise 
tendencies with a high practical importance: Permeability-porosity relationships are a frequent type 
of predictor. Besides porosity, the pore size has a dominant influence on permeability. Figure 2-9 (left) 
shows the general tendencies for clastic rocks (sandstone).

Reservoir Rocks, Reservoir Properties
The complex pore structure and diversity of carbonates result in problems to derive and correlate 
permeability with porosity and other parameters (Figure 2-9, right). Reservoir properties are controlled 
by two basic pore networks (Lucia 1999, 2007): 
•	 Interparticle pore network (intergranular and intercrystalline porosity), and
•	 Vuggy pore network (pore space larger than or within the particles and commonly present 
as leached particles, fractures, and large irregular cavities). The effect of vugs on reservoir 
properties is strongly controlled by the type of interconnection:
οο Separate vugs (only connected via the interparticle pore network, if present), and
οο touching vugs (direct vug-vug contact).
2.5	
Core analysis
Core analysis is an important component of reservoir characterization and strongly connected with log 
analysis. Main tasks are the validation of log-derived reservoir description, determination of critical 
analysis parameters, and core analysis is the sole source of some petrophysical data. In addition, a reservoir 
fluid analysis is provided in some cases. Recommended practices for core analysis are compiled by the 
American Petroleum Institute (API 1998).
Because of the extra rig time involved, cores are expensive – this is why usually only the reservoir 
interval is cored.
There are two types of core acquisition:
•	 Conventional (or rotary) cores: Full diameter cores range from 1¾ in (4.5 cm) to 5¼ in 
(13.5 cm) – Note: Loss of core can indicate good reservoir rock.
•	 Sidewall core (percussion and rotary sidewall coring).
A full-diameter core is a cylindrical (approximately 1.75 to 5.25 inches in diameter) sample of rock. 
For laboratory measurements, the core is dissected into multiple plugs (about 1 inch in diameter and 3 
inches long). A less expensive option is sidewall coring. 
Direct determination of the reservoir properties is subject of core analysis in core laboratories. We 
distinguish between Routine core analysis (RCAL) and Special core analysis (SCAL); see Figure 2-10.

Cores are therefore essential for:
a)	 Direct determination of reservoir properties like porosity and permeability (also in order to 
validate log interpretation),
b)	 Calibration of log measurement (for example NMR-derived permeability),
c)	 Determination of fundamental petrophysical properties for log interpretation (for example 
Archie’s parameter m and n, grain density).

Reservoir Rocks, Reservoir Properties
Limitations and problems of core measurements are: 
•	 Core is only a small section of rock and is not necessarily representative of a reservoir or a 
large section. This is a question of homogeneity,
•	 Coring and recovery change stress and temperature and may change rock structure,
•	 Plugging, cleaning, and drying may change the wettability of plugs.
Andersen, et al. (2013) note: “The basic description of core material comes from routine analysis. This service 
includes measurement of porosity, saturation and permeability to answer three fundamental questions about 
a reservoir. Does the rock contain a fluid-filled space (porosity); does it contain hydrocarbons in that space 
(saturation); and can those hydrocarbon fluids be produced (permeability)? Core gamma logging provides a 
link of the core depth to wellbore logging depth, and core computed tomography (CT) scans indicate the core 
heterogeneity. Core photographs taken in both white and ultraviolet light are used for both documentation 
and core description.”
Detailed understanding of a reservoir requires additional measurements obtained in the special core 
analysis laboratory (SCAL). Electrical measurements obtain Archie exponents for calibrating electrical 
logging measurements of porosity and saturation and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Core 
measurements determine a formation-specific cutoff value for the relaxation time from an NMR log. 
Capillary pressure measurements by mercury injection, centrifuge, or porous plate methods indicate 
distributions of pore throats and are used to evaluate saturation distribution as a function of height in a 
formation. Relative permeability determines the multiphase flow character of the formation and can be 
performed at ambient or elevated conditions of pressure and temperature. Wettability is determined by 
Amott-Harvey or USBM methods” (see for example Tiab and Donaldson 2014; API 1998).
2.6	
Summary
Porosity characterizes the volume of pore space; it is a scalar property. Porosity shows a strong correlation 
with density (and other properties measured by nuclear, acoustic, or electrical methods).
Permeability expresses the ability of fluid flow and is a tensorial property. Permeability correlates with 
porosity, but is strongly influenced by pore diameter (or grain size) and pore connectivity. This causes 
the difficulties in permeability determination.
Porosity, fluid saturation, and permeability are criteria for net pay definition. Some definitions in 
Figure 2-11 may illustrate this:
•	 Gross thickness: Refers to a lithological or stratigraphic unit and is not related to the fluids in 
the formation.
•	 Net thickness: Represents the total interval of reservoir quality rock within the gross thickness, 
it will produce fluids, and it must exceed some defined thresholds (cutoffs).

•	 Darling (2005) formulated the following statement, “Generally, the cutoff point should be set at 
a value equivalent to a permeability of 1 md for oil zonesand 0.1 md for gas zones”.

Well Logging – Overview
3	 Well Logging – Overview
This section describes the general principles of well logging (open hole), gives a classification of the tools and the main 
parts of the equipment.
Tools have different responses and realize measurements under the specific condition of a borehole; this results in 
characteristic radial depth of investigation and the vertical resolution as characteristic properties of the methods.
3.1	
Introduction
The general purpose of log measurements is to provide a continuous profile of:
•	 Lithology with exact depth of formation/rock boundaries,
•	 Rock properties and rock composition (mineralogy); of special interest are reservoir properties 
(porosity, saturation, permeability),
•	 Fractures and tectonic elements,
•	 Mechanical rock properties for stability, sanding problems, frack operations, etc.,
•	 Indications or content and properties of other substances than hydrocarbons (water, thermal 
water, ores, coal, salt, construction materials),
•	 Seismic-relevant parameters for integrated interpretation of seismic and log measurements,
•	 Changes of properties; this is important particularly with respect to change of fluid content/
saturation during production (monitoring, time lapse measurements).
Cuttings are a valuable source of information for interpretation of the logs. If no cores are available, 
cuttings carry the only direct substantial information – they tell us something about the dominant 
mineral components and matrix porosity, help to establish a “rock model” for multimineral analysis. 
Mud and cuttings samples are accumulated on a catching board below the shaker screen. Cutting needs 
a certain time (“lag time”) to circulate from the bottom of the well (bit position) to the shaker screens. 
A rule of thumb (Hyne 2001) is: In an 8-in (20 cm) hole it takes about 10 minutes for mud to circulate 
each 1000 ft (300 m).Well cuttings are sampled as a composite sample over each 10 ft (3 m) of depth or 
at shorter interval in the reservoir.
3.2	
Principle of log measurement
The wireline logging equipment consists of a set of probes, the cable with winch, a depth sensor, and 
the surface measuring and control unit.
In the Measurement While Drilling (MWD)/Logging While Drilling (LWD) technique, the measuring 
elements are part of the drill string; signals are transmitted via mud pulses to the surface unit.

tool position, transmits the energy downwards and the measured data upwards,
•	 Winch with depth counter,
•	 Surface unit for controlling the measuring process, visualizing and storing measured data.

Well logs provide a continuous graph of formation parameters presented versus depth. This result of 
measurements with a set of methods is called the “log” and includes a number of traces. Each trace 
shows the variation of the physical parameter measured with the corresponding method as a function 
of depth (Figure 3-2). The “Art of Formation Analysis” is the extraction of reservoir properties from 
such a set of logs (Bigelow 2002).

Figure 3-2: The log – each trace shows the variation of a physical parameter as a function of depth (Bigelow, 2002). Left trace: 
Spontaneous Potential SP in mV; right trace (logarithmic scale): three resistivity curves with different radii of investigation. Separation 
of the logs results from an invasion effect and indicates permeable zones (sandstone), whereas a fit of the three curves indicates a 
non-permeable section (shale).
The “Header” (Figure 3-3) on top of the log traces is a part of documentation of the log measurement. 
Important information from the log header includes:
•	 Hole location and name,
•	 Depth – Driller, Depth – Logger, Casing depth, Bit size,
•	 Logged Interval,
•	 Fluid Type in Hole, Density/Viscosity, pH/Fluid Loss, 
•	 Fluid resistivities: 
 (mud resistivity) at measured temperature, 
 (mud filtrate resistivity) 
at measured temperature, 
 (mud cake resistivity) at measured temperature, Source of 
 
•	 Temperature: Bottom hole temperature, maximum recorded temperature
•	 Time since circulation.
Calibration tails are added to the end of log displays to convey the necessary information. Logging tools 
require shop calibration. Onsite tool calibrations are necessary before the start and after the end of a 
measurement. They are compared with the shop calibration in order to confirm a proper functionality.

All log measurements mostly deliver “indirect” information – and therefore need a transformation 
into reservoir properties (interpretation, formation analysis). But on the other hand – and compared 
with the direct core measurement – they deliver continuous information on the vertical profile without 
any “core loss”. For computer-supported interpretation the quantitative nature of information is a high 
benefit. And finally log data have no information loss or change with time (alteration etc.) and allow a 
“reinterpretation” also after years.

Logging methods – Classification
Wireline logging methods can be classified following the (physical) principle of measurement as shown 
in Figure 3-4. There are two fundamental types:
1)	 Passive tools measure properties or parameters delivered by the formation or by interaction of 
the formation and the borehole-fluid without any source (e.g. natural Gamma-measurement/
Gammalog, Spontaneous Potential/Self Potential).
2)	 Active tools measure the “answer” to a signal, pulse, radiation, current, i.e. the result of an 
interaction with the formation in the vicinity of the tool. Typically they have a source and one 
or more detectors (e.g. Gamma-Gamma-Log, Acousticlog, Resistivitylogs).

shale profile, carbonate reservoirs),

Well Logging – Overview
Measurement While Drilling (MWD) and Logging While Drilling (LWD) realize measurements 
simultaneously to the drilling process using special measuring systems as part of the drill string near 
the bit. In a modified technique nearly all wireline methods are realized. Data are transmitted to the 
surface unit by coded pressure pulses through the mud in real time. Large data files can be stored in the 
memory for later transmission and recovery. Thus, the MWD/LWD components are:
a)	 Downhole sensor system and telemetry,
b)	 Transmission system and medium,
c)	 Surface system (decoding/display/archival).
Measurement While Drilling (MWD) primarily assists drilling in order to optimize drilling process – 
the first objective is to steer the well optimally. Formation evaluation and reservoir measurements are 
an “extra”. Benefits of these techniques are (after Baker Atlas, 2014):
•	 Safety – early detection of problems,
•	 Saving rig time, data are logged while drilling progresses,
•	 Optimizing the drilling process, geosteering to enhance well positioning (Figure 3-5),
•	 Capability for better measurements, longer logging time – better statistics, closer to the borehole 
wall, less time for invasion.

3.4	
The tool (probe) and the environment of measurement
Logging tools measure certain physical properties; resistivity tools, for example, measure the electrical 
resistivity of the formation. The measured magnitude is representative for a defined volume of response 
in a radial distance from the tool axis. The response of a tool is controlled by the design of its elements 
(e.g., electrode array) and expressed as “tool characteristic”.
All borehole measurements are realized in a non-homogeneous environment:
•	 The well itself originates an inhomogeneity effect. This effect must be “corrected” for 
determination of “true” formation properties. Therefore caliper and mud properties influence 
the measured property and are necessary for correction.
•	 Infiltration creates additional inhomogeneity in radial direction. In porous, permeable rocks 
infiltration forms a typical radial profile (Figure 3-2, Figure 3-6). In the invaded zone much 
of the original fluid is replaced by the mud filtrate (sometimes the invaded zone is subdivided 
into a flushed and a transition zone). In the uninvaded or virgin zone – in greater distance 
from borehole wall – original fluids are not contaminated by mud filtrate.
•	 Vertical inhomogeneity is (depending on the vertical resolution) originated by the thickness 
of layers. It results in, for example, the “shoulder bed effect” of resistivity measurements.

For the ratio 
, i.e. the ratio of the diameter of the invasion 
 to the diameter of borehole 
 (see 
also Figure 4-6), Asquith and Krygowsky (2004) give the following values as orientation:
 = 2	
for high porous rocks
 = 5	
for intermediate porous rocks
 = 10	
for low porous rocks
In case of inhomogeneity, measured data represent averaged or “apparent” properties (controlled by 
the response function of the tool). But for quantitative formation characterization the “true” physical 
properties of the uninvaded (virgin) formation as well as of the invaded zone are necessary.
The tool characteristics are described by its response function and/or its vertical resolution, and the 
radius (depth) of investigation. Figure 3-7 schematically shows the radial response function for a simple 
transmitter – receiver tool. The differential response g(r) gives the normalized contribution of a cylinder 
with radius r to the measured signal. Therefore the maximum can be considered as the radial distance 
with the strongest influence on the measured magnitude. As cumulative presentation the integral response 
G(r) describes the radial buildup of the total measured signal. For tool characterization the radius of 
G(r) = 0.5 (50%) is frequently used as “radius of investigation 50%”. Radius of investigation 50% (r50) 
means that 50% of the total signal response is originated in a radial distance below r50, and 50% originates 
from the space outside this cylinder.

Well Logging – The Methods
4	 Well Logging – The Methods
This section describes the most applied logging methods and tools without technical details. For each method the 
physical principle and the main applications are discussed.
This section compiles the “toolbox” for a combined application and for interpretation.
A detailed description of the different tools, the physical principles, and applications are given in various textbooks 
(for example Asquith and Krygowski, 2004; Ellis and Singer, 2007; Darling, 2005) and the companies’ manuals and 
chartbooks (see Recommended books and sources).
4.1	
Borehole geometry
The geometry of a borehole is given by the geometry of the well trajectory and the diameter of the well 
as a function of the depth.
The geometry of the trajectory is determined by azimuth and inclination of the well sections as a 
function of the depth. By convention
--
inclination is defined as angle (in degrees) between the local vertical gravity vector and the 
tangent to the well bore axis at a particular point: 0° is vertical and 90° is horizontal. 
--
azimuth of a borehole at a point is the direction of the borehole on the horizontal plane. 
Azimuth is measured as a clockwise angle (0°–360°) from the North reference.
Inclination is necessary for transformation of “measured depth” MD to the “true vertical depth” TVD:
--
Measured Depth (MD) is the distance measured along the borehole from the surface reference 
point.
--
True Vertical Depth (TVD) is the distance measured vertically from the surface reference point.
Tools mostly work on the basis of gyro systems; older tools with magnetic systems are known as “single 
shot and multiple shot” instruments.
The diameter of the borehole as a function of the depth is measured with a Caliper log. There are two 
principles:
a)	 Mechanical systems (Figure 4-1): One or more pads are pressed against the borehole wall during 
upward motion. The angle between pad mechanism and tool axis is a measure of the pad distance 
from the tool axis. 2-arm, 3-arm, 4-arm and 6-arm caliper tools are in use. Sophisticated tools 
deliver the diameter in different azimuths with orientation from a gyro system. Frequently the 
pad holds other measuring systems (for example microresistivity).

b)	 Acoustic systems: Ultrasonic Caliper or Acoustic borehole televiewer (see section 4.6) deliver 
a circular two-way travel time from the rotating transmitter-receiver-system to the borehole 
wall. Conversion into a distance via mud wave velocity gives a detailed azimuthal caliper.

Figure 4-1: Different types of (mechanical) caliper tools (Bigelow 2002).
Caliper measurements can be done in open and cased wells with all borehole fluids (gas or air, water, 
water or oil-based mud).
The most important applications of caliper logs are:
•	 Borehole geometry and stability, breakouts,
•	 Indication of permeable zones (mud cake),
•	 Thickness of mudcake,
•	 Indication of fractured zones,
•	 Borehole volume (for cementation operations).
The caliperlog delivers very important input for caliper-correction of many borehole measurements, for 
quality control, and for identification of “bad hole situation”. Therefore caliper logs are auxiliary to the 
other measurements.
The caliperlog is part of a graphic log presentation (mostly left trace). It is mostly named CAL or CALI 
and presented in inch or cm.

Well Logging – The Methods
4.2	
Electrical and electromagnetic logs
In 1927 the Schlumberger brothers started the development of well logging with the first electrical resistivity 
measurement. In 1942 Archie published the fundamentals of interpretation of electrical resistivity logs 
with his famous equations. Both – resistivity measurement and Archie-based interpretation – are also 
today’s cornerstones of well logging particularly for determination of water saturation.
The resistivity of a formation is a key parameter in determining hydrocarbon saturation. Electricity can 
pass through a clean formation only because of the conductive water it contains.
Electrical (galvanic) and electromagnetic (inductive) logs measure the electrical resistivity or conductivity 
of the formation as a function of the depth.
Measurements are possible in open holes.
¾
¾ Galvanic resistivity measurements using electrodes are possible only in conductive water-based 
mud,
¾
¾ Inductive conductivity measurements using antennas are possible in non-conductive oil-based 
mud or dry wells and also in water-based mud.
Tools have different radial depth of investigation, are influenced by invaded and non-invaded zone 
in different ways and indicate permeable, invaded zones by log separation. Processing delivers 
resistivity of invaded and of non-invaded zone. Sophisticated array tools deliver a dataset for detailed 
inversion techniques.
Application:
•	 Determination of water saturation (Archie equations),
•	 Characterization of the invasion process.
4.2.1	
Specific electrical resistivity of rocks
Formation resistivity covers a broad range of magnitudes from about 0.1 to 1000 Ohm-m, depending 
on porosity, water saturation, salinity, and shalyness. Resistivities higher than 1000 Ohm-m are typical 
of impervious, very low-porosity formations (e.g., evaporates).
Clean rocks – Archie’s (1942) equations:
In a “clean porous rock” (for example sandstone without clay and/or other conductive solid components), 
the formation water is the only electrically conductive component, because matrix (quartz) and 
hydrocarbons or air in the pore space are insulators. In this case the specific resistivity of the rock is 
proportional to the specific resistivity of the pore water.

The specific resistivity of the formation water is a function of salinity (concentration of dissolved salts) 
and temperature (see nomogram Figure 4-3).

The proportionality between rock resistivity and formation water resistivity is the fundamental idea 
of Archie’s (1942) equations which describe the relationship of rock resistivity to porosity and water 
saturation:
For a water-saturated porous rock (Sw = 1) the specific rock resistivity Ro is controlled by the resistivity 
of the pore water Rw
Ro = F . Rw
The introduced formation resistivity factor F depends on porosity:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can

a)	 Formation factor versus porosity; slope gives m = 2.00
b)	 esistivity index versus saturation (porosity = 0.17); slope gives n = 2.16.
For partial water saturation Sw, the specific rock resistivity Rt increases with decreasing water saturation. 
Archie (1942) formulated this by introducing a “resistivity index I” and referenced the rock resistivity 
Rt at any water saturation Sw to the rock resistivity at total water saturation Ro:

n is the empirical saturation exponent.
In a plot I versus water saturation Sw with logarithmically scaled axes (Figure 4-4), this is represented 
also by a straight line with the slope n.
Thus,
•	 the formation factor F expresses the magnification of the rock resistivity (compared with water 
resistivity) as result of the non-conductive solid minerals.
•	 the resistivity index I expresses the magnification of the rock resistivity (compared with water-
saturated rock resistivity) as result of the non-conductive fluid components (oil, gas).

Well Logging – The Methods
Shaly rocks:
The presence of shale results in a decrease of reservoir quality (porosity, permeability) and “disturbs” 
traditional interpretation algorithms and techniques – particularly Sw determination using Archie’s 
equation. Shale in the formation is a second conductivity component in addition to the formation water. 
“Shale conductivity” results from interface effects of clay minerals and adjacent electrolyte (formation 
water). Frequently this effect is described by the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of clay. Neglecting this 
conductivity contribution of shale to the measured conductivity (= resistivity-1) results in an overestimate 
of the calculated water saturation. Some shaly sand equations eliminating this effect are discussed in 
section 5.6.2.
4.2.2	
Electrical log measurement – Principles
In well logging a diversity of tools are applied to deliver a resistivity model of the formation mostly in 
terms of resistivity of the non-invaded (virgin) zone, resistivity of the invaded zone, and depth of invasion.
Electrical properties are measured in the open hole
•	 with galvanic tools (resistivity logs): Current is introduced via electrodes and the voltage is 
measured also via electrodes within a conductive (water-based) mud.
•	 with induction tools (induction logs): An electromagnetic field is introduced and measured 
via antennas which is also possible in non-conductive (oil-based) mud.
With different geometries of the electrodes and antennas the response of the tool can be directed to 
different radial zones (invaded zone, shallow-, medium-, and deep-reading tools).
In the MWD/LWD-technique specific high frequency propagation tools are used.
4.2.3	
Resistivity tools
The first resistivity tools used 4 electrodes (current electrodes A and B, voltage electrodes M and N) 
in different geometry called Normal tool (Figure 4-7); a second 4 electrode type is the Gradient tool.

Well Logging – The Methods
Measured electrical parameters are the current 
 and the Voltage 
. Then the resistance is 
. The 
specific electrical resistivity of the formation 
 is connected with a factor k characterizing the geometry 
of the current distribution
For the simple situation of the 4-electrode tool in a homogeneous medium this factor is
If the electrode B of a potential sonde is placed at a large distance from the other electrodes, the 
equation gets
The distance 
 is called the “spacing”. The red point O is the reference point of the electrode 
array: The measured magnitude is referenced to the depth of this position.
There are two standard configurations of 4-electrode normal tools:
a)	 Short Normal with the spacing L = 16 inch ≈ 0.40 m,
b)	 Long Normal with the spacing L = 64 inch ≈ 1.60 m.
Conventional 4-electrode tools have a moderate depth of investigation (depth increases with spacing) 
and no sharp vertical resolution (vertical resolution decreases with spacing). Figure 4-7b shows how the 
ratio of bed thickness h to spacing L controls the logged resistivity curve; there is no sharp step at the 
boundary but a smoothed shape called “shoulder bed effect”.
Particularly in highly resistive formations the current from the electrode A has the tendency to miss the 
formation and prefer adjacent better conductive zones and the mud column. As a “hardware solution” 
of this problem4, focusing electrode-systems or laterologs have been developed (Figure 4-8): Additional 
bucking or guard electrodes above and below the measuring current electrode A emit a current to focus 
the measuring current laterally into the formation. The guard current is regulated electronically in such a 
kind, that there is no potential difference between additional monitoring electrodes (focusing condition). 
With this technique three goals are attained:
a)	 Focused measuring current flow perpendicular to the tool,
b)	 Deep penetration of the focused current (into the uninvaded zone) and simultaneously,
c)	 Sharp vertical resolution.

Non-focusing tool (normal device):
For non-focusing tools the “free 
current flow” avoids the highly 
resistive layer and takes the way of 
“lowest resistivity”.
 
Focusing tool (Laterolog):
The additional bucking current 
from the guard electrodes presses 
the measuring current into the 
highly resistive formation.

There are various devices in application; typical examples are:
•	 Dual Laterolog (with Deep and Shallow Laterolog),
•	 Laterolog 3 (uses cylindrical guard electrodes).
Figure 4-9 shows the Dual Laterolog with Deep and Shallow Current Patterns.
Focusing resistivity logs (Laterolog) and focusing induction logs (see next section) are powerful 
instruments for determination of the specific resistivity of the non-invaded formation Rt.

For investigation of the invaded zone (and the determination of 
) another tool type is applied – the 
family of micrologs. The electrode system is fixed on a pad and pressed against the borehole wall. The 
electrodes have a very short distance (microlog 2.5 cm) and therefore they are characterized by:
•	 Extreme vertical resolution, able to detect thin layers, but also fractures,
•	 Extremely small depth of investigation (
).
There are unfocussed systems (classic Microlog ML), as well as focussed systems (for example 
Microlaterolog MLL, MicroSphericalFocusing Log MFSL).
4.2.4	
Induction tools (Inductionlogs)
Induction tools are developed for measurement of formation resistivity in boreholes containing oil-based 
muds and in air-drilled boreholes. Electrode devices did not work in these non-conductive muds. 
Induction tools measure the formation conductivity (= specific resistivity-1). An electromagnetic field 
with frequencies in the order of 20 kHz is transferred into the formation and measured on the basis of 
an electromagnetic coupling via antennas or coils (Maxwell‘s equations apply) instead of the galvanic 
coupling via electrodes in case of resistivity tools. Therefore induction tools also work in case of non-
conductive mud or borehole fluid (oil-based mud or dry well).

Well Logging – The Methods
Figure 4-10 illustrates the principle:
•	 A high-frequency alternating current of constant intensity is sent through the transmitter coil 
and generates an alternating primary magnetic field.
•	 This alternating primary magnetic field induces a circular alternating voltage and a current 
flow in the formation (the loop is coaxial with the transmitter coil) which is controlled by the 
conductivity of the formation.
•	 The current causes an alternating secondary magnetic field which is sensed by the receiver 
coils as an induced voltage.
•	 Thus, the measured signal is controlled by the tool parameters and formation conductivity.
Because the alternating current in the transmitter coil is of constant frequency and amplitude, the ground 
loop currents are directly proportional to the formation conductivity. The voltage induced in the receiver 
coil is proportional to the ground loop currents and thus also to the conductivity of the formation.

Focussing tools with different characteristics increase the vertical resolution and monitor different depths 
of investigation (deep and medium induction tool). Some typical induction tools are the Dual Induction 
Log and the Dual Phase Induction Tool (uses R- and X-signals). The Phasor-lnduction SFL tool uses a 
conventional dual induction-SFL array to record resistivity data at three depths of investigation:
•	 Spherically focused log: Shallow-reading device affected mainly by the flushed (
) zone 
(radial distance about 30 cm).
•	 Medium induction (ILM): Depending on the invasion diameter and profile the ILM may be 
influenced by the 
 or 
 zones or both; (radial distance about 60…80 cm).
•	 Deep induction (ILD): Mostly affected by Rt, unless invasion is very deep.

Well Logging – The Methods
A specific tool type are induction tools with orthogonal transmitter-receiver systems (Section 4.2.6).
Since both types – resistivity and induction tools – can be used in water-based holes, some “rules of thumb” 
were formulated (Asquith and Krygowski, 2004; Schlumberger, 1989) for detection of hydrocarbons in 
exploration wells:
•	 For 
 use laterolog,
•	 For 
 use inductionlog.
The inductionlog gives a direct reading of 
 under conditions of fresh mud with 
, shallow 
invasion and low formation resistivity.
4.2.5	
Determination of true resistivity (Rxo and Rt)
In a water-bearing formation with low formation water resistivity 
, the infiltration of the mud-filtrate 
with higher resistivity 
 results in an increase of rock resistivity in the infiltrated (
) zone compared 
with the non-invaded zone (
).
In a hydrocarbon-bearing formation the resistivity 
 is relatively high as result of lower water saturation 
. Infiltration displaces a part of the original fluid (water and hydrocarbon) and results in a decrease of 
rock resistivity in the infiltrated zone (
). This is illustrated in Figure 4-11). Two notes are important: 
•	 The 
-level in the hydrocarbon-bearing formation is somewhat higher than the corresponding 
level in the water-saturated formation. This is the effect of a residual hydrocarbon volume 
(
) in the pore space which is not totally displaced by the mud filtrate. This gives 
important information about the moveable part of hydrocarbon.
•	 The magnitude of 
 in the hydrocarbon-bearing formation is controlled by porosity, water 
saturation, and formation water saturation. Therefore 
 can be low for highly saline formation 
water also in case of high hydrocarbon saturation.

Figure 4-11: Resistivity profile for water-bearing (left) and a hydrocarbon-bearing (right) zones.
The different types of classic resistivity logs cover preferentially the following zones of a formation:
•	 The resistivity of the flushed zone 
 controls dominantly Microlog (ML), Microlaterolog 
(MLL), Microsperically Focused log (MSFL).
•	 The resistivity of the non-invaded zone 
 controls dominantly Laterolog deep (LLD), 
Laterolog-3 (LL 3), Inductionlog deep (ILD). But all “deep-reading tools” are also influenced 
by the flushed zone, because current crosses this zone. Laterolog shallow (LLS) and Inductionlog 
medium (ILM) read a somewhat mixed effect of the non-invaded zone and the invaded zone.
The mission of resistivity measurements is the determination of 
 and 
 for saturation calculation 
(
). For a “Quick-look” estimate of 
 a microresistivity tool is used in many cases and 
 is 
approximated by a “deep-reading” focused tool (e.g. LLD). A more exact technique is based on a graphic 
or numerical solution of the problem to derive “true resistivities” 
,
 and 
 from a set of measured 
“apparent resistivities” (for example RMLL, RLLS and RLLD).
The principle can be demonstrated by application of the so called “tornado charts”: Tornado charts are the 
result of a forward modeling of the response answer of tools with different formation resistivity models 
(given in terms of 
). Figure 4-12 shows the chart for a dual Laterolog-Rxo device combination 
for thick beds and 8 inch borehole. 
The charts are plotted in logarithmic scale for resistivity ratios in general:
•	 The x-axis shows the ratio of the forward calculated ratio 
 and the y-axis the forward 
calculated ratio 
,
•	 The parameter of the individual curves correspond to the model input (ratio 
, ratio 
, and depth of invasion 
) attributed to the calculated curves.

Well Logging – The Methods
The application includes the following steps (see example in Figure 4-12):
1.	 Take the measured resistivities 
 and 
2.	 Calculate the ratios 
 and 
,
3.	 Enter the abscissa and ordinate and plot the ratios on the chart. 
4.	 The intersection of the lines is the solution of the problem in terms of 
, 
 and 
.
5.	 Calculate the true resistivities 
 and 
.
Example:
We read from the log:
 = 16 Ohmm	
 = 10 Ohmm	
 = 4.5 Ohmm
Calculate the ratios:	
 = 3.56 	
 = 1.60
At the intersection we read: 	
 = 1.33	
= 4.7	
 = 36 inch
Therefore the result is:	
 = 21.3 Ohmm	
 = 4.53 Ohmm
Please note: 
a)	 The true resistivity of the non-invaded formation 
 = 21.3 Ohmm is distinctly higher than 
the measured resistivity of the deepest reading tool 
 = 10 Ohmm. This results from the 
influence of the lower resistivity (4.53 Ohmm) of the invaded zone (
 = 36 inch). Neglecting 
this effect would result in an overestimate of 
.
b)	 The true resistivity of the invaded zone 
 = 4.53 Ohmm is close to the measured resistivity 
of the micro tool 
 = 4.5 Ohmm.

Some sophisticated tools and methods
Resistivity calculation by an inversion process: The principle of this modern technique (see 
Figure 4-13) is:
1.	 Measure a set of resistivity/conductivity data with various electrode or antenna combinations 
(array configuration) with different spatial response,
2.	 Derive (computer-supported) an initial resistivity/conductivity earth model,
3.	 Run a forward calculation with this information to get the response for your individual array 
configurations,
4.	 Compare forward-calculated data with measured data and run an iteration process in order 
to get the best fit resistivity/conductivity model as result.
Prominent examples for this technology are:
High-Resolution Laterlog Array HRLA (Schlumberger): The tool has five independent, actively 
focused, depth- and resolution-matched measurements. These measurements, with a 2D earth model 
and inversion scheme, simultaneously account for borehole, shoulder-bed and invasion effects and gives 
an accurate, more robust 
.

Well Logging – The Methods
Array Induction Imager Tool AIT (Schlumberger): The AIT sonde contains eight induction arrays with 
spacings ranging from several inches to several feet. A single transmitter operates simultaneously at three 
frequencies, with adjacent frequency pairs utilized by six of the arrays. – In-phase (R) and quadrature 
(X) signal components are measured for each array and each frequency to provide 28 induction-array 
measurements acquired at 3-inch depth intervals. – The 28 array conductivity measurements are borehole-
corrected and combined using functions weighted in both the r (radial) and z (depth) directions to 
produce a set of five logs. The logs have median depths of investigations of 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 inch 
from the center of the borehole. The deep-reading logs are quite insensitive to the borehole and the 
near-wellbore region.
Azimuthal Resistivity Imager ARI (Schlumberger): The ARI makes directional deep measurements 
around the borehole with high vertical resolution. Tool uses 12 azimuthal electrodes (incorporated in a 
dual laterolog array) and results in an azimuthal resistivity display.

Well Logging – The Methods
Orthogonal systems: Tool examples are 3DEX (Baker Atlas) and Rt Scanner (Schlumberger). Motivation 
for these tools are mainly laminated reservoirs: Since the tool cannot resolve the individual layer, the 
measured parameter represents an “averaged” value, depending on the response characteristic of the 
tool. Measurements in different directions result in different resistivities (“macroscopic anisotropy”). 
Derivation of a horizontal and a vertical resistivity allows a more precise determination of the resistivity 
of the sand fraction (reservoir component) and detects anisotropy in general (Mollison et al., 1999; 
Schoen et al., 1999, 2000).
Figure 4-13: Derivation of a resistivity model by an inversion process; data are measured using an multielectrode resistivity device. – 
Inversion result: The radius of invasion can be seen in this two-dimensional color image where the colors represent resistivity 
values. In this case the inversion only need one radial boundary to match the log data. We can use the resistivity of the regions 
furthest from the borehole as an estimate of true virgin formation resistivity, and we canuse the resistivity of the regions closest 
to the borehole as an estimate of the resistivity of the zone fully flushed with mud filtrate (Baker Atlas Document, course 
material 2014).

Spontaneous potential (SP)
Spontaneous potential SP is a natural electrical potential (very small voltage, given in mV) observed 
in a water-based mud-filled borehole. This voltage is measured by a downhole electrode relative to a 
reference electrode. The SP is measured mostly simultaneously with the resistivity log in an open hole 
with water-based mud.
The origin of spontaneous potential (Figure 4-14) is a charge exchange process driven by the difference 
of concentration (salinity) between formation water 
 and the mud filtrate 
. The concentration 
difference (in most cases is 
) results in an ion motion controlled by the electrochemical 
properties of the
•	 permeable sandstone creating a negative diffusion potential 
 as result of the higher mobility 
of the positive Na-ions
•	 non-permeable shale creating a positive membrane potential 
 as result of the anion-blocking 
(ion-selectivity) of the clay minerals.
Figure 4-14: The Spontaneous Potential: a) Origin as result of an electrochemical interaction of formation 
water and mud/mud filtrate; b) Log example (sand-shale section).
SP as a relative measurement combines the effect of both components. The maximum difference between 
the most negative and the most positive level is called static spontaneous potential SSP

The parameter 
 is controlled by temperature, type of dissolved salts (electrolyte), and membrane 
activity of shale; it is about 71 mV at 25 degrees Celsius (or degrees Fahrenheit) for NaCl. For practical 
application, the following empirical equation can be used (Desbrandes, 1985):
The SP-curve is influenced by several effects (correction charts eliminate most effects; see for example 
Schlumberger, 1989):
•	 Bed thickness and borehole size, 
•	 Depth of invasion (correction charts),
•	 Hydrocarbons: 
 causes a reduced magnitude of the SP in the reservoir zone.
Frequently a “shale baseline shift” can be observed as result of a change of clay mineralogy, water 
mineralization and/or temperature with depth.

Well Logging – The Methods
There are two main applications of the SP-log:
1.	 Lithologic profile, sand – shale discrimination, and detection of permeable zones: The deflection 
of the SP-curve from a relatively stable “shale baseline” in a reservoir zone is negative if 
, positive if 
, and zero if 
An estimate of the shale content is also possible with the following relationship
	
where
 is the maximum SP deflection in a clean zone (wet) near the zone of interest,
 is the SP magnitude of the shale base line,
 is the SP in the zone of interest (log).
2.	 Rw calculation: Since the electrolytes’ specific electrical resistivity and concentration are inverse 
with a good approximation, the ratio 
 can be replaced by the ratio 
	
The resistivity of the formation water 
 is a fundamental input for calculation of water 
saturation. The equation offers the possibility of a determination from the SP-log at formation 
temperature without a water sample:
For Rw determination, 
– the mud filtrate resistivity (at formation temperature), 
 – the 
difference between the SP level in a clean zone and the shale baseline, and T – the formation 
temperature are used as input. 
For Rw determination a nomogram is frequently used (see example 7.1 Oil-bearing Sandstone).

Nuclear logs
•	 Three main types of measurements: Gammalog, Gamma-Gammalogs, Neutronlogs.
•	 Measurements are possible in open and cased boreholes. 
•	 For all nuclear measurements borehole corrections are necessary (e.g. caliper and

Introduction – Overview and fundamentals
Nuclear logs are an important group of log measurements using nuclear radiation. Measurements are 
possible in open hole and cased hole. Basic types of nuclear methods are
•	 Measurement of the natural gamma radiation of the formation (Gammalog)
•	 Measurement of the radiation as result of an interaction of the source-emitted radiation with 
the formation
οο Gamma-Gamma-logs (uses a gamma source),
οο Neutronlogs (uses a chemical neutron source or neutron generator).
Some fundamentals regarding the atomic structure, some terms and the statistic nature of the nuclear 
or radioactive processes will help to understand the function of the tools:
Interactions of radiation with the target material (formation) are processes connected with the atomic 
structure. Some properties and magnitudes of important with regard to these processes are summarized 
in Table 4-1.

Table 4-1: Atomic properties for nuclear measurements.
Radiation energy is given in Electronvolt (eV): 1 eV is the energy needed to move one electron with the 
charge of 1.6 10-19 C (Coulomb) through a potential difference of 1 Volt.
Nuclear processes are statistically determined. The statistical variation obeys a Poisson distribution with 
the standard deviation  equal to the square root of the total number of counts N
It follows that the precision of a nuclear measurement depends on the number of counts recorded – 
therefore statistical precision can be improved by logging slowlier and/or using sensors with high sensitivity.

Natural gamma measurement – Gammalog
Natural radioactivity is the spontaneous decay of a certain isotope into another isotope, characterized by 
emission of radiation. The three types of radiation (α, β, γ) have different ability to penetrate a material:
α, β : are particle radiation with a very shallow penetration or high absorption,
γ: is an electromagnetic wave with high penetration.
Therefore γ-radiation (gamma radiation) is preferred for practical application.
Natural gamma activity of minerals and rocks is originated by 
•	 Uranium-radium series (half-life time of 4.4·109 years)
•	 Thorium series (half-life time of 1.4·109 years)
•	 Potassium K40 (half-life time of 1.3·109 years).
The result of emission at discrete energies for U- and Th-series and the monoenergetic radiation from 
K is a spectrum of radiation.
Occurrence and behavior of the three components in rocks are different. The abundance of these elements 
or isotopes in a formation controls the intensity of detectable natural radioactivity.

Table 4-2 shows

Typical minerals forming the “clean” reservoirs (quartz, calcite, dolomite) have no gamma 
activity,
--
Clay minerals in general are characterized by a higher content with a big scatter and different 
content of individual clay types,

Mica and K-feldspar also show high concentration creating natural gamma radiation.
The spectral character of decay results in two techniques of measurement:
•	 Integral measurement – measures all incoming counts above an energy-threshold
•	 Spectral measurement – measures in energy-windows and delivers count rates (and 
concentration) for the three components K (in %), U and Th (in ppm).

The following corrections are necessary: 
•	 Absorption of radiation in the borehole fluid: influence of caliper and mud density, 
•	 Tool position (centralized or sidewall): centralizing the tool decreases count rate,
•	 Mud type: KCl muds increase potassium count rate,
•	 Logging speed: influences statistics and vertical resolution.

calibration facility is constructed of concrete with an admixture of radium to provide U decay series, 
monazite ore as a source of Th, and mica as a source of K. Figure 4-16 shows the general tendency of

Applications of the (integral) Gammalog are:
•	 Design of a lithological profile, particularly sand-shale separation, localization of “clean zones”, 
•	 Estimate of shale content,
•	 Depth adjustment: This processing step removes depth discrepancies between the different 
logging runs. Discrepancies are caused for example by cable stretch. One Gammalog is chosen 
as reference log for data quality. The other gamma logs are matched to the reference using 
an automatic routine. Resulting depth shifts are applied to the other logs on the tool strings.
•	 Lithological correlation from well to well if a number of wells is logged in a field.

Figure 4-17: Sand-Shale Separation: It is recommended to plot a “Sand Line” first, connecting the minima 
of GR, then to plot a “Shale Line” as second step, connecting the maxima. By interpolation a qualitative 
lithological column can be plotted. sand layers as potential reservoir zones are clearly visible. Please 
consider also the effect at thin layers: Adjacent beds influence the “true” level of a thin layer.
In the first trace the difference of the bit size minus measured Caliper is plotted. Sandy zones show positive 
difference indicating the presence of mud cake. Thus, there are two completely different indicators for 
reservoir zones: Low gamma based on low shale content, and mud cake indicating permeability. 
Another important application of the Gammalog is calculation of the shale content based on the 
correlation between shale content and gamma activity. It implements the assumption that only shale 
contains radioactive components in a rock and no other radioactive minerals (for example K-feldspar) 
are present.
Steps of shale content calculation are (see Figure 4-18 and Figure 4-19):
1)	 Analyzing the Gammalog and definition of the minimum level representing clean zones 
 
and the maximum level representing pure shale 
2)	 Calculation of the “Gamma Ray Index” with the measured gamma values

Well Logging – The Methods
If a spectral gamma measurement is available, it is recommended to use a Gamma Ray Index calculated 
only from K and Th. These two components are dominated by the mineral composition, whereas U is 
controlled more by the environment of sedimentation and organic components (Schön, 2011). Spectral 
measurement also helps to detect K-feldspar, mica or glauconite as origin of high radiation.
Particularly in carbonate series, the integral gamma intensity is very often a poor clay indicator, because 
the measured value is not related to clay content, but to the presence of uranium. A spectral measurement 
therefore gives more information. Typical cases are
•	 Pure carbonate (chemical origin) which has a thorium and potassium level near zero. If uranium 
is zero too, this carbonate was precipitated in an oxidizing environment.
•	 If there is variable uranium content, the carbonate can either have been deposited in a reducing 
environment, or it corresponds to a carbonate with stylolithes or to phosphate-bearing layers.
•	 If thorium and potassium are present along with uranium, this indicates a certain clay content 
of the carbonate. 
•	 If potassium is present with or without uranium it can correspond to a carbonate of algal origin 
or a carbonate with glauconite (Schlumberger, 1982). 
Figure 4-20 presents these tendencies for carbonate.
Figure 4-20: Gamma components in carbonates.
A kind of “clay mineral typing” is possible because clay minerals show different Th/K ratio (Figure 4-21).

The high Uranium content of organic components is an indicator for source rocks and gives a link to 
TOC (Total Organic Content). – As rule of thumb, the Th/U ratio is recommended as an indicator for 
environment (Fertl, 1979):
Th/U > 7	
	
continental, oxidizing
Th/U < 7	
	
marine, grey…green shales
Th/U < 2	
	
marine, black shales, phosphates.
Extremely high concentrations are observed in stagnant, anoxic waters with low rates of sediment 
deposition as they are typical of black shales (North Sea Jurassic “hot shales”).

Gamma-Gamma-logs
Gamma-Gamma-methods use the interaction of gamma radiation produced by a source (as part of the 
tool) with the formation. The main components of a Gamma-Gamma-probe are (Figure 4-23):
•	 Gamma source (Cs or Co),
•	 One or more gamma detectors detecting the backscattered radiation, 
•	 A shield between source and detectors to supress direct radiation. 
There are three effects with regard to gamma material interaction:
1.	 Photoelectric effect,
2.	 Compton effect,
3.	 Pair production.
The probability of interaction depends on the energy of the gamma radiation and the atomic number 
of the target material (Figure 4-22). For most rock-forming elements and the commonly used Cs or 
Co source the Compton effect dominates. Observation of low energy components also controls the 
Photoelectric effect.

Figure 4-22: Gamma ray absorption effects (Hearst and Nelson 1985).
Interactions result in absorption of radiation and can be characterized by an absorption coefficient as a 
material property. The absorption coefficient is connected with the absorption cross section of the target 
material and related to the type of interaction. Thus there is an absorption coefficient for the Photoelectric 
effect and one for the Compton effect. 
The photoelectric cross section shows a strong correlation to the atomic number Z. On this basis an 
effective photoelectric index PE (average photoelectric cross section per electron) is defined:
PE has the unit b/e (barns per electron).
The index PE strong depends on the on elemental composition and is therefore a typical characteristic 
of various minerals (Table 4-5). This presents a possibility for identification of rock types. PE can help 
to discriminate between quartz, calcite, and dolomite, and is extremely sensitive to barite (mud).
In case of several minerals in a formation, the photoelectric index is not a linear function of the PE-
values of the mineral components, a second parameter U (volumetric photoelectric absorption index) 
was introduced 
U = PE . ρ
In a multimineral lithology this index is the volume weighted sum of the individual contributions.

The Compton Effect is a scatter reaction with the orbiting electrons of the target material. Therefore 
the probability of an interaction is controlled by the number of electrons, which is equal to Z. For the 
most common earth minerals, the ratio Z / A is constant (Table 4-5). 
Since rock bulk density 
 is dominated by atomic mass A, the following relationship connects the 
“electron density” 
 as seen by the Compton effect via this ratio:

Gamma-Gamma-probes (Figure 4-23) have two detectors with different spacing (distance between source 
and detector). For both spacings a different calibration function results. If irregularities of the borehole 
(rugosity etc.) exist, the short-spaced measurement is influenced more strongly than the long-spaced 
one and a correction or compensation of these effects is possible. The information delivered by these 
measurements are the corrected density (RHOB) and the applied density correction (DRHO).
DRHO is a significant measure of log quality (QC):
--
Correction curve DRHO should be near zero in smooth holes,
--
DRHO > 0.05: Data quality may be questionable due to loss of pad contact,
--
DRHO > 0.10: Indicates that the density value is not reliable.

3.	 Density determination for general rock characterization and as input for seismic processing

Thus, for porosity calculation from GG-density two input parameters are necessary:
1.	 Matrix density (or an information about mineralogy),
2.	 Fluid density: The depth of investigation for GG-measurements is very shallow (Table 4-6); 
thus, the measurement is controlled by the flushed zone in most cases and the density of mud 
filtrate can be used. Only in case of shallow gas invasion density is lowered; for calculation an 
average fluid density of 0.7 g/cm3 is recommended (see Asquith and Krygovsky, 2004).

Neutron methods
Neutron methods use the interaction of neutron radiation from a source (as part of the tool) and the 
formation. The main components of a neutron probe are: The neutron source (chemical source or 
neutron generator), one or more detectors (neutron and gamma) detecting neutron radiation after 
slowing down processes and induced gamma radiation, and a shield between source and detectors to 
supress direct radiation.
Neutrons are classified by their energy: 
•	 Fast neutrons > 500 keV, 
•	 Intermediate neutrons 500 … 1 keV, 
•	 Slow neutrons < 1 keV (epithermal 1 … 0.1 keV, thermal < 0.1 keV).

Well Logging – The Methods
Neutrons as a particle radiation (a neutron has approximately the same mass as a proton) react with the 
nuclei of the target material. There are different types of interaction:
1.	 Moderating interactions result in an energy decrease (slowing down effect)
a)	 Inelastic scattering
b)	 Elastic scattering
2.	 Capturing interactions.
Figure 4-24 illustrates the processes during the life of a neutron and will be described from the high to 
the low energy level in the following section.
Figure 4-24: Neutron phenomena as a function of energy (in MeV). The neutron sources and the energy regions are indicated at 
the bottom. At the top are the types of reactions and processes plotted (adapted after a figure from Hearst and Nelson, 1985).
Inelastic Scattering: 
Neutrons collide with a nucleus and transfers a fraction of their kinetic energy to the nucleus, which results 
in the nucleus’ excitation, followed by the emission of a characteristic gamma photon (de-excitation). 
The emitted gamma radiation is characteristic for the target element (see Table 4-7). An application is 
the Carbon/Oxygen log.

Well Logging – The Methods
Elastic Scattering: 
Neutrons collide with the atomic nucleus and lose kinetic energy. The maximum energy loss results 
for a target material with the same atomic mass as the neutron; this is the case for hydrogen. The other 
rock forming elements have a lower slowing down effect and are different (see Table 4-8). This leads to 
the conclusion:
--
Elastic scattering is dominated by Hydrogen in the formation; therefore a strong contribution 
is expected from the liquids with a high H-concentration (water and oil) and a somewhat 
lower contribution from gas with a some lower H-concentration. In general, elastic scattering 
is dominated by pore fluids.
--
Other elements have a distinctly smaller effect; but this effect is different for each element. 
Therefore a different neutron response for different minerals (quartz, calcite, and dolomite) 
is expected.

Neutrons can be captured when they are thermalized. With this process a compound nucleus in an 
excited state is formed. When it returns to the ground state, it and emits gamma radiation with an 
exactly defined energy (see Table 4-7). The capturing effect is used with the TDT Log (Thermal neutron 
diffusion/decay measurements).

Neutronlog for porosity determination – Tools and calibration
For neutron porosity measurement elastic scattering is applied using the dominant effect of hydrogen 
as component of pore fluids. The relationship between measured neutron readings and porosity is 
determined by calibration. Most tools are “limestone-calibrated” (Figure 4-25). Therefore the calibration 
curve relates the neutron reading (response) to the porosity of a fresh water saturated limestone. Different 
mineral composition and different pore fluids result in a deviation from the porosity defined as the ratio 
of pore volume divided by sample volume.
Tool examples are the SNP – Sidewall neutron porosity tool (Schlumberger) – and the CNL – Compensated 
Neutronlog (Schlumberger).

Well Logging – The Methods
Since the neutron tool is calibrated for a limestone matrix and fresh water as the pore fluid, only for this 
situation, the measured neutron porosity is exactly the true porosity. For a different formation and/or 
pore fluids, corrections are necessary:
•	 Other matrix materials (sandstone, dolomite) have a different neutron effect in comparison 
with limestone;
•	 Particularly shale has a high amount of H and this results in a high neutron porosity → a shale 
correction is necessary; the Neutronlog can be used as a shale indicator.
•	 Other pore fluids than fresh water have a different H-concentration. This is expressed by the 
“hydrogen index” (Table 4-10).
Figure 4-26 shows a simplified picture of a porous rock with the various solid and fluid components. As 
a general rule the different responses indicate that:
--
For a water- or oil-saturated rock, the neutron response reflects mainly porosity, whereas gas 
(with a lower H-content/volume) has a lower neutron effect.
--
The solid minerals in general have a small – but not negligible – influence (“matrix effect“). 
--
Shale with a high amount of bound water can have a strong effect.

Application of nuclear measurements for mineral analysis
Traditional nuclear measurements (natural Gammalog, Gamma-Gamma-log, Neutronlog) offer 
possibilities for an initial classification using defined characteristic values or tendencies. Examples are:
•	 Shale indication from a Gammalog and a combination Gamma-Gamma-density and Neutronlog,
•	 Carbonate detection (limestone, dolomite) using neutron-density cross plots (see chapter 5), 
•	 Identification of dolomite and/or limestone supported by photoelectric cross section (PE) 
measurement,
•	 Identification of anhydrite by extremely high density (2.96 g cm-3), supported by PE measurement.
For a more detailed and reliable characterization of the mineralogical composition, elemental analyses 
based on spectral nuclear measurement have been developed. The physical processes of nuclear 
measurements are directly connected with the reaction of certain elements and their components. 
Neutron gamma spectrometric methods using pulsed neutron generators can deliver information about 
the concentration of various elements from gamma rays produced either by inelastic scattering or by 
in neutron capture events. Elements occurring in different rock components are listed in Table 4-11.

In carbonate formations neutron capture spectroscopy (Schlumberger, 2008) can be used to detect Ca, 
Mg, and S, and therefore to discriminate dolomite CaMg(CO3)2 from calcite CaCO3 and provide accurate 
estimates of anhydrite volumes (CaSO4). 
Modern methods and tools like “Elemental Capture Spectroscopy Sonde ECS” and “EcoScope” 
(Schlumberger) and the “Formation Lithology eXplorer (FLeX)” (Baker Atlas) determine certain 
elemental concentrations and calculate mineral composition based on a model assumption. Fundamental 
papers were written, for example, by Hertzog et al. 1987, Gilchrist et al. 1999, 2000, Pemper et al. 2006, 
and Han et al. 2009.
Neutron capture spectroscopy is an integrated component of the Schlumberger “Carbonate Advisor” 
(www.slb.com/carbonates). For carbonates the measurement of magnesium and sulphur can be used for 
discrimination of calcite and anhydrite and for anhydrite volume estimate (underestimating anhydrite 
content results in underestimation of grain density and underestimation of total porosity). The brochure 
gives an example and demonstrates that “incorporation of neutron spectrometry in the lithology-porosity 
analysis identifies anhydrite and improved the porosity estimates, which are up to 2 p.u. (porosity units) 
higher than the porosity derived from triple-combo logs alone”.

Acousticlog, Sonic log
Acoustic logs or Sonic logs measure the velocity of elastic waves (or slowness, the inverse property) of the 
formation. Therefore in general elastic properties of the formation are investigated with the measurement.
Results give information about porosity, lithology, and supports seismic exploration.

The velocity of elastic waves in rocks – particularly in reservoir rocks – shows a complex dependence 
on various influences. This is subject of special literature (e.g., Schön, 1999, 2011). The following 
dependencies are of interest for practical application:
1.	 Velocities vp and vs decrease with increasing porosity (porosity effect; see Figure 4-29),
2.	 Different lithology (sandstone, limestone, dolomite) show different magnitudes of velocity for 
same porosity value (matrix effect),
3.	 A change of pore fluid from gas to water results in a strong increase of vp but a small decrease 
of vs (pore fluid effect),
4.	 Velocities increase nonlinearly with increasing effective pressure (pressure effect).

Well Logging – The Methods
The equation works best for water-saturated and well-compacted porous rocks, particularly sandstones. 
Presence of gas can give erroneous results (Asquith and Krygowski, 2004).
Poor consolidation or low effective stress results in high slowness values and therefore an overestimate of 
porosity. In this case a “compaction correction” is recommended: The slowness in an adjacent shale bed is 
used as “compaction reference”. If measured slowness is 
>
∆shale
t
 100 µs/ft, the following equation for a 
compaction-corrected Wyllie porosity is recommended (see for example Asquith and Krygowski, 2004):
For carbonates with intergranular porosity Wyllie’s equation can be applied. For carbonates with 
secondary porosity, vugs, fractures with much larger dimensions than primary pores the wave propagation 
is still controlled mainly by primary porosity. Therefore the equation results in porosities which are too 
low by the amount of secondary porosity. Thus, an estimate of secondary porosity fsec can be given by 
the difference between total porosity (from density or neutron) ft and sonic-derived porosity fSV based 
on Wyllie‘s equation fsec = ft – fSV (Asquith and Krygovski, 2004; see also Lucia 2007).
In deep and medium invaded reservoir zones (and in water zones) compressional wave propagation is 
controlled by mud filtrate as pore fluid and the magnitude of 
 is approximated by water slowness. 
For hydrocarbon-bearing zones at shallow invasion an empirical correction is recommended (Asquith 
and Krygovski, 2004):
 × 0.7 for gas	
	
 × 0.9 for oil.

Acousticlog/Soniclog measurement – Principles
Figure 4-37 shows the simplest configuration of an Acousticlog probe. The ultrasonic transmitter generates 
a compressional wave, which is transmitted through the mud and hits the formation at the borehole 
wall. From this boundary incident wave propagates as reflected and refracted waves. The Acousticlog 
uses the refracted wave. If the wave velocity of formation > wave velocity of mud, the refraction wave 
moves in the direction of the boundary. At the so called critical angle a refracted wave propagates with 
the velocity of the formation along the borehole. The wave generates secondary waves passing the mud 
and arriving at the two receivers. Difference of the arrival time divided by receiver distance gives the 
slowness of the formation (if the tool is centered)5.
The right part of the figure shows the wave traces with first arrival for compressional wave, second arrival 
for shear wave. A third arrival (not marked) is the Stoneley wave.

Well Logging – The Methods
For Quality Control you may check DT values in anhydrite (50 µs/ft = 164 µs/m) or casing (57 µs/ft = 
187 µs/m).
“Compensated” tools use multiple transmitter-receiver pairs in order to minimize the borehole effect. 
“Array” tools have many receivers. Data from all receivers are processed for a precise and robust 
determination of wave arrivals (compressional, shear, Stoneley); see Figure 4-31. A powerful part of these 
sophisticated systems is the application of correlation techniques (Semblance technique).
Figure 4-31: Modern digital sonic tools (left) offer the possibilities of a signal correlation (right)
An important part of the tool is the transmitter. Particularly in so-called “slow formations” where the shear 
wave velocity of the formation is lower than the compressional wave velocity in the mud no refracted 
shear wave can be observed. In such cases a special transmitter (dipole-shear) creates a shear wave in 
the formation. Sophisticated tools work with a simple monopole transducer, dipole and/or quadrupole 
transducers to initiate all wave types. 
Main applications of acoustic/sonic logs are:
•	 Support for seismic interpretation (velocity-depth function, synthetic seismograms),
•	 Porosity determination based on Wyllie’s equation or other empirical equations, 
•	 Porosity and lithology determination (combination with neutron and gamma-gamma-density 
log (cross plots etc.),
•	 Derivation of elastic rock properties (Poisson’s ratio, Youngs modulus),
•	 Permeability estimate from Stoneley wave analysis (Tang and Patterson 2004),

A special application in completed wells is Cementation Control (Cement bond log). In order to control 
if the cement is adhering solidly to the outside of the casing the log uses the variations in the amplitude 
of an acoustic signal traveling down the casing wall between a transmitter and receiver to determine 
the quality of cement bond on the exterior casing wall. The fundamental principle is that the acoustic 
signal will be attenuated more strongly in the presence of cement than in uncemented casings. The 
newer versions, called cement evaluation logs, along with their processing software, can give detailed, 
360-degree representations of the integrity of the cement job, whereas older versions may display a single 
line representing the integrated integrity around the casing (Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary).

NMR measurements 
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements use the interaction of hydrogen nuclei with an 
external magnetic field. Hydrogen nuclei (protons) have a magnetic and an angular momentum. In 
an external magnetic field interaction results in a precessing motion with a typical frequency (Larmor 
frequency):
𝑓𝑓0 = ( 𝛾𝛾
2 𝜋𝜋) ∙ 𝐵𝐵0 
where B0 is the strength of the external magnetic field and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio which is typical 
for the substance (Table 4-14). Hydrogen nuclei are a component of fluid molecules of water and 
hydrocarbons in the pore space.
Nucleus

13C

Table 414: Gyromagnetic ratio.
The measurement consists of a series of steps (Figure 4-32) – called CPMG (Carr, Purcell, Meiboom 
and Gill) sequence – using two magnetic fields:
•	
 – the external static field which controls the Larmor frequency
•	
 – the “tipping” field (RF-pulse). It is applied perpendicular to the B0 field (90°RF pulse) and 
creates coherency of the spinning protons.
In certain time steps TE so-called 180°RF pulses repeat the polarization and create an echo of the signal. 
Irreversible interactions result in a decrease of the echo amplitude and describe the signal decay.

Well Logging – The Methods
The relaxation (and built up) process can be described by exponential functions with the two relaxation 
time terms:
•	
- longitudinal, or spin-lattice relaxation time,
•	
- transverse, or spin-spin relaxation time.
Two pieces of information are extracted from the spin echo sequence:
1)	 Initial signal amplitude: The initial signal amplitude is controlled by the number of hydrogen 
nuclei associated with the pore fluids in the measurement volume – thus, it gives the porosity.
2)	 Signal amplitude decay: The amplitude decays exponentially with time and is characterized 
by the decay time 
.
Figure 4-32: Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence: Timing of the RF-pulses transmitted into the formation, 
and Free Induction Decay (FID) and spin echoes detected by the receiver. The envelope of the spin echo maxima 
decays exponentially with the time constant T2. The extrapolation of the spin echo envelope to time zero yields the 
net magnetization. After calibration, the net magnetization is a direct measure of formation porosity (Appel 2004).
Figure 4-33 shows the principle of an NMR borehole tool. The static magnetic field B0 is a function of 
the radial distance from the tool axis and exactly known. For a given magnitude of the field, the Larmor 
frequency is defined. Realizing the measurements within this frequency band relates the measurements 
to an exactly defined radial distance (response space, sensitive volume).

In a porous rock protons in the fluid relax differently with respect to their “bonding properties”. 
There are independent mechanisms (see Figure 4-34) described by a 
-decay time: 
•	 T2,bulk = T2 relaxation time of the pore fluid as it would be measured in a container.
•	 T2,surface = T2 relaxation time of the pore fluid resulting from surface relaxation.
•	 T2,diffusion = T2 relaxation time of the pore fluid as induced by diffusion in the magnetic field 
gradient.

In general the decay covers the sum of relaxation contributions from clay bound water, capillary bound 
water (irreducible water), free movable water, and diffusion if gas is present and can describe it as a sum 
of exponential terms with different relaxation time and magnitude. 
The processing extracts a distribution of 
 (Echo Data Inversion) from the decay curve (see Figure 4-35). 
So called cutoffs separate the regions:
•	
: about 1 … 5 ms (clay minerals).
•	
: faster decaying clastics about 33 ms – slower decaying carbonates about 92 ms.

The analyse of each individual NMR-record is the basis for important applications:
The 
 plot (Figure 4-36) provides 
1)	 Information about the main components 
•	 Clay-bound water 
 (and shale content);
•	 Irreducible water 
 represents the specific surface of pores; a low 
 is typical 
for large pores and high permeability;
•	 Bulk volume moveable 
 represents the volume of free moveable fluids.
2)	 The numerical interpretation delivers
a)	 The effective porosity by integration over 
 and 
b)	 A permeability measure: The ratio 
 is a measure for the specific internal 
surface. “Coates equation” (Coates et al. 1999) gives a permeability estimate: 
	
or generalized
	
where 
 are calibration parameters determined by comparison of direct core measurements and 
NMR measurements (Figure 4-37). This parameter expresses the difference between a simple capillary 
and the complicated geometry of the real pore space.

NMR fluid typing techniques are based on differences of 
1T  and

(D), and derived properties for different fluids (Table 4-11); properties – particularly for gas – are 
dependent on temperature and pressure.

Imaging Techniques
Acoustic or electrical resistivity scanning techniques can create electronic pictures (“images”) of the 
borehole wall in optically non-transparent fluids (mud). Images have an azimuthal orientation and are 
characterized by extremely high resolution. Pictures carry valuable information about bedding dip, faults, 
vugs and pore types, fractures etc.
The acoustic borehole televiewer (Figure 4-39 left) scans the borehole wall with a rotating ultrasonic beam. 
The transducer emits a high frequency signal, which passes the mud and is reflected at the borehole wall. 
The reflected signal passes the mud in the opposite direction and is received by a transmitter. Thus, there 
are two parameters: The amplitude of the reflected signal and the two-way travel time for the distance 
transmitter – borehole wall.
This reflection process is realized during the rotation of the transducer system and delivers a full 
360-degree scan in terms of amplitude and travel time. A gyro-based system additionally gives the 
azimuth and produces an oriented scan of the borehole wall.

Well Logging – The Methods
Acoustic borehole televiewers are very sensitive with respect to tool eccentricity and borehole ovality; 
centralization of the tool is therefore of critical importance.
With the simultaneously measured mud velocity, a detailed oriented caliper can be derived from the 
two-way traveltime.
The amplitude is color-coded in most cases and therefore looks like a real picture (Figure 4-40). Typical 
readings of electrical scanning systems are:
•	 High amplitudes in smooth dense formations and hard layers (dense limestone, anhydrite), 
•	 Medium amplitudes in porous rocks, shale,
•	 Locally low amplitudes at fractures, vugs etc.

Electrical Resistivity Imaging is based on the registration of the electrical resistance at the vicinity of a 
number of electrode buttons fixed on a pad scratching along the borehole wall (conductive mud required). 
Each individual button measures the contact resistance. Depending on the electrode array and borehole 
diameter a system of four or more electrode pads scans in several sectors. Modern tools overlap these 
sectors and deliver the full circle. Resistance is plotted along with orientation mostly colour-coded which 
again looks like a picture.
Typical readings of electrical scanning systems are:
•	 High resistance in a smooth dense formation and hard layers (dense limestone, anhydrite).
•	 Medium to low resistance in water-bearing porous rocks, shale,
•	 Locally low resistivity at (open) fractures, vugs etc.

5	 Log Interpretation – 
Introduction
This section describes principles of log interpretation focused on the oil and gas exploration. Two connected 
practises are discussed:
1.	 Quick look interpretation for a first scanning of logs and information about zones of interest.
2.	 Methods of quantitative interpretation (determination of lithology/shale content, porosity and mineral 
composition, and fluid saturation.
Algorithms and inputs are the same for any computer supported interpretation.
5.1	
Overview
Measured log data are given mostly as a data file in a special format (LAS-file). Data processing realizes 
important steps like corrections and extraction of true parameters from the measured data set (for 
example 
 and 
).
These data are the input of the petrophysical interpretation. As demonstrated in the following sections 
and the examples, an interpretation needs additional inputs from core data and/or cuttings analysis and 
information about fluids particularly mud and mud filtrate (at formation temperature).
The general goal of interpretation is the determination of:
•	 Lithological profile and the detection and characterization of the potential reservoir zones 
with exact depth,
•	 Shale content and shale type (e.g., laminated, or dispersed shale),
•	 Porosity (and mineral composition),
•	 Fluid saturation, water saturation, hydrocarbon saturation, movable hydrocarbons, type of 
hydrocarbon (oil, gas),
•	 Permeability.
Sophisticated interpretation concepts result in a combined methodology with corresponding computer 
programs in order to finally find a consistent rock model.

Lo g Interpretati o n – Introductio
Interpretation delivers a solution in two steps:
1.	 “Quick-look” interpretation for a qualitative description of lithology and zones of interest.
2.	 Detailed quantitative analysis in terms of porosity, saturation, shale content, mineral 
composition, and permeability.
Fundamentals and tools for log interpretation are:
a)	 Knowledge of characteristic log responses, 
b)	 mpirically derived equations for quantitative interpretation,
c)	 Model-derived equations for quantitative interpretation,
d)	 Implementation of all information (geology, cuttings, cores, …)
	
	
…and the experience of the interpreter.
Logs have a particular sensitivity with respect to reservoir properties, based on their physical principle 
(Figure 5-1).

•	 For porosity determination a combination of at least two methods (Gamma-Gamma-density 
and Neutron) is recommended,
•	 Besides that the “main application” methods deliver valuable information for solving other 
problems (the Gamma-Gamma-density and Neutronlog is a powerful shale indicator in 
addition to porosity).

Two important steps are necessary before interpretation starts:
a)	 Compilation of all information about lithology, particularly expected rock type and mineral 
composition (clastic sediments, limestone, dolomite), presence and type of shale/clay, pore 
types etc.,
b)	 Check of quality and completeness regarding the measured logs: Quality Control/QC, 
calibration, complete header information, caliper log (breakouts, bad hole).

Quick-Look methods
Quick-look methods “…are helpful to the geologist because they provide flags, or indicators, that point 
to possible hydrocarbon zones requiring further investigation.” (Asquith and Krygowski, 2004).
5.2.1	
A General flowchart for scanning logs to identify zones of interest
Asquith and Krygowsky (2004) recommend the following flowchart (Figure 5-3) for “scanning logs” to 
identify zones of interest:
•	 Separate the shaly sections, select “clean sections“, then
•	 If clastics are logged, look at (deep) resistivity first – if it is high, hydrocarbons may be present; 
then look at porosity (only in case of extremely low porosity the rock with the high resistivity 
is tight and no reservoir).
•	 If carbonates are logged, look at porosity first – if it is sufficient, look at resistivity – if it is 
high, hydrocarbons may be present.

Permeable bed identification
Permeability of a formation is necessary for production; if a formation is permeable, it has also got a 
certain amount of porosity. 
Permeable beds can be identified quickly using the following indicators: 
•	 Spontaneous Potential (SP); the Diffusion Potential directly indicates a permeable formation,
•	 Mud filtrate invasion detected by multiple resistivity measurements,
•	 Presence of mudcake indicated by Caliperlog,
Note: The Gammalog gives an indication related to mineral composition, but not directly to permeable 
and non-permeable zones. 
Figure 5-4 shows a section of a sand-shale profile with 
 > 
. The three resistivity curves fit well in 
the non-permeble shale beds (no invasion) and separate in the permeable sandstone. In the sandstone 
the Microlaterolog (MLL) – controlled by Rxo – shows a low resistivity compared with Laterolog deep 
(DLL) and Laterolog shallow (SLL) which are strongly influenced by the non-invaded zone (
). Because 
RMLL < RDLL and RSLL it can be concluded that the sandstone is hydrocarbon-bearing.

Calculation of the shale volume 
 is the first step of quantitative interpretation. The calculated shale 
content is used for:
•	 General reservoir description,
•	 Volumetric rock model,
•	 Various “shale corrections” (see for example shaly sand equations).
5.4	
Quantitative Interpretation: Porosity from a single log 
Porosity as a fundamental reservoir property can be determined indirectly from Gamma-Gamma-Density 
log, Neutronlog, and Acoustic-/Sonic log.
Porosity calculation requires the matrix properties and the fluid properties as expressed in the equations 
(left side with Greek symbols, right side with Latin alphabet) as additional input: 
 are the measured (logged) data.
Matrix properties can be determined from:
•	 Known lithology/mineral composition; in this case representative values are recommended 
(Table 5-1); most critical is matrix slowness,
•	 Core laboratory measurements (for example grain density),
•	 Cross plot techniques (see following section).

In the presence of borehole fluid invasion into a gas-bearing reservoir, some specific conditions must 
be considered (Asquith and Krygowski, 2004):
Invasion tends to force the gas from the formation and replace it with borehole fluid. Porosity calculation 
from Neutron and Gamma-Gamma-Density measurement needs fluid properties. The influence upon 
the two porosity logs depends on their radial sensitivities and their depths of investigation (DOI).
If the invasion fluid front gets deep into the reservoir, the neutron and density porosity measurements 
approach the true porosity for the assumption of mud filtrate density and neutron response as fluid 
properties. 
For shallow invasion (shallow with respect to the depth of investigation) the tools’ responses are spatially 
weighted averages of the invaded and non-invaded regions of the formation. The problem in deriving 
porosity in the presence of shallow invasion comes from the fact that the neutron and density logging 
devices have different radial response: 
•	 The 50% DOI of the thermal neutron porosity tool is 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm). 
•	 The 50% DOI of the density tool is about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm).

Therefore the following rules are recommended:
--
When the invasion front is greater than 12 inches (30 cm), both tools see only water-filled 
(mud filtrate) formations and the two porosity estimates agree and read true porosity. 
--
When the invasion front is less than 12 inches (30 cm) but greater than 6 inches (15 cm), the 
density tool sees only the invaded formation, while the neutron tool is sensitive to both the 
invaded and the non-invaded region. Under these conditions, the density porosity estimate is 
the true value, while the neutron porosity estimate is still low. 
--
Below 6 inches (15 cm) of invasion, both tools are sensitive to both the invaded and non-invaded 
regions. Thus, for a certain range of depths of invasion, accurate determination of formation 
porosity becomes very difficult. A root mean square (RMS) equation is recommended for gas 
reservoirs:

Porosity and Mineral Composition – Multiple Porosity Methods
Motivated by the fundamental importance of an exact porosity value for reservoir characterization and 
for calculation of other properties (saturation), mostly two or more independent methods for porosity are 
applied. This gives the possibility of a combined interpretation (multiple porosity) directed on a derivation 
of porosity and rock composition. This situation is illustrated by the following cartoon (Figure 5-5).
Figure 5-5: Multiple porosity determination – Cases and principle.
The combination of Gamma-Gamma-Density and Neutronlog is applied most frequently.

If the lithology (mineralogy) and also water saturation can be assumed for a formation, then porosity 
can be calculated with both methods (for example for a limestone use neutron response matrix = 0, 
matrix density = 2.71 g cm-3, neutron response fluid = 1.00, and fluid density = 1.00 g cm-3). If both 
independent calculations deliver the same porosity (case 1) it can be concluded that:
1)	 The used interpretation model (limestone/calcite and water) is correct.
2)	 The calculated porosity is correct.
If the calculated porosities are different in case 2, the conclusion is that the used interpretation model 
(matrix mineralogy, fluid) is not correct. For combined interpretation the input must be modified or 
approximated. Thus, the conflict of two different answers can be solved by derivation of representative 
mineral composition and fluid type.
This idea is realized by different practical methods and techniques:
1)	 Overlay technique,
2)	 Cross plot technique,
3)	 Numerical solution of a system of response equations.
5.5.1	
Overlays of two Logs
For the overlay technique two porosity curves are plotted in the same log trace and referenced to an 
identical porosity scale and a defined rock model (matrix and fluid). If, for example, Neutron porosity 
(limestone-calibrated tool) and Density-derived porosity (calculated also under assumption of calcite 
as matrix with density 2.71 g cm-3) are plotted, then in a
•	 Water-saturated limestone both tools read same porosity,
•	 Sandstone or dolomite both tools read a somewhat different porosity,
•	 Shaly section neutron reads higher porosity than density resulting from the clay-bound water,
•	 Gas zone neutron reads lower porosity than density resulting from the lower H-concentration 
measured by the neutron log.
Important for overlay analysis is to understand the scales for both methods. There are two types:
Type 1:
Neutron Porosity (limestone-calibrated) and Density Porosity (using matrix density for limestone 2.71 g 
cm-3) are plotted from left to right. In this case there is only one scale (or two identical scales). If there is 
dolomite or anhydrite in the formation, then density is higher than 2.71 g cm-3. Calculation of limestone-
referenced porosity therefore results in an apparently negative porosity value on the right-hand end of 
the scale.

Lo g Interpretati o n – Introductio
Type 2:
Again increasing Neutron Porosity (limestone-calibrated) and decreasing Density are plotted from right 
to left. The density scale is adapted for a limestone. Therefore: 
•	 At Neutron porosity NPHI = 0.0, Density of RHOB = 2.7 g/cm3.
•	 At Neutron porosity NPHI = 0.3, Density of RHOB = 2.2 g/cm3.
•	 At Neutron porosity NPHI = 0.6, Density of RHOB = 1.7 g/cm3.
If the density of the formation is higher than 2.7 g/cm3 (anhydrite, dolomite), the scale must be expanded 
further to the right to accommodate, for example, at density 2.96 g cm-3 (anhydrite) a corresponding 
Neutron porosity of -0.15.Type 2 is illustrated in Figure 5-6.
 
Figure 5-6: Gamma log GR, Resistivity, Density- and Neutronporositylog for some typical situations (Andersen, 2011).  
The logs allow a first interpretration using following criteria: 
Shale: High GR, crossover of Density (red curve) and very high apparent Neutronporosity, 
Gas-bearing zone: Low GR, crossover of Density and very low Neutronporosity; high resistivity, 
Oil-bearing zone: Low GR, low crossover of Density and Neutronporosity; high resistivity, 
Water-bearing zone: Low GR, no crossover of Density and Neutronporosity; low resistivity.
If it is known that the formation is composed of different lithologies (for example a sandstone-shale 
formation) and this overlay technique is applied, the limestone-referenced scale delivers a deviation of the 
two curves. Therefore it is more comfortable to convert or transform both porosity logs to a sandstone 
matrix (see example 7.1 Oil-bearing Sandstone) and expect a fit for both logs in such cases.

Cross plot – clean Matrix
While overlays present the logs of a section, the cross plot technique combines individual data sets of 
defined depth steps. For the combination of Neutron and Densitylog, the Neutron readings (limestone-
calibrated porosity) from the LAS-file are plotted on the x-axis and the measured Gamma-Gamma-
Density in reverse direction on the y-axis for each depth step (Figure 5-7).
Plots start in the lower left corner with the “matrix-points” and go up to the upper right corner to the 
“water-point” with linear scaled porosity. For practical use only the part for porosity < 0.45 (< 45%) 
is plotted:
•	 The coordinates x = NPHI = 0.0 and y = RHOB = 2.71 g cm-3 describe a dense (no porosity) 
calcite and is therefore called “matrix-point limestone”.
•	 Increasing porosity (pore fluid water) moves the position linearly upward from this matrix 
point in the direction of a “fluid-point water” at x = NPHI = 1.0 and y = RHOB = 
 = 
1.0 gcm-3. The connecting straight line represents a pure limestone with linear-scaled porosity.
•	 Different rocks (sandstone/quartz, dolomite) have a matrix point defined by matrix density 
and matrix neutron response.

The result are three lines for limestone, dolomite, and sandstone. The deviation from a straight line 
of the dolomite and sandstone curve is contributed for a better approximation and depends on tool 
characteristics.6
Crossplots allow an estimate of mineralogy (lithology) and the determination of a consistent porosity. 
Measured data are plotted into the designed curve set. The position of the data point delivers the correct 
porosity and the mineral type or composition. 
This is demonstrated in Figure 5-7 (example):
Log data: 	
	
Neutron porosity 	
	
NPHI = 15% (0.15)
	
	
	
Gamma-Gamma-Density 	
RHOB = 2.56 g/cm3
Crossplot gives:		
Porosity = 13% (0.13); the rock is a mixture of dolomite and limestone.

Deviations and problems occur for Neutron-Density-Crossplots if shale or gas is present:
Ø
Ø Gas in the formation shifts the points toward low neutron porosity, because gas has a lower 
H-concentration compared with water and in most cases the Neutronlog “reads” the non-
invaded zone,
Ø
Ø Shale content shifts the points from the sand line towards dolomite, because apparent Neutron 
porosity increases (clay-bound water effect). For shaly sand a specific cross plot can be designed 
with a sand point, a wet-shale point, and a water point. This is a component of shaly sand 
analysis (see 7.2 Shaly sand profile).
A very helpful modification of the Neutron-Density-Cross plot is the implementation of a “third 
dimension”: Individual data points are color-coded by their Gamma activity (Figure 5-8). If colour 
indicates low shale content (low Gamma), then the point represents a clean rock (in the sandstone, 
limestone or dolomite region). If color indicates high shale content and the point plots, for example, in 
the porous dolomite region then this is not really a highly porous dolomite but could be a shaly sandstone.
Crossplot – Shaly sand
A specific application is the interpretation of shaly sands. In a Neutron-Density crossplot data points of 
clean sandstone are arranged along the sandstone line. With increasing shale content the data points are 
shifted to higher Neutron porosity (clay-bound water effect). If data points are color-coded with Gamma 
intensity (GR) this effect is visible as demonstrated in Figure 5-8.

The distribution of all data points allows picking the “wet shale point” at the highest GR (pure shale). 
It characterizes the shale including the clay bound water. The wet shale density can be extracted on the 
vertical axis and the wet shale Neutron porosity (neutron response wet shale) on the horizontal axis.
The volumetric rock model (Figure 5-9) describes density and porosity in terms of effective and 
shale porosity.

Generalized solution for a composite matrix
Porosity and volume fractions of rock components (minerals) can be determined very elegantly

Acoustic log/Sonic log (if the linear principle of the time-average equation can be applied). In case of 
4 independent measurements the system can be solved deterministically for 4 + 1 = 5 volume fractions 
(porosity + 4 minerals).
The calculation of rock composition and porosity based on this set of linear equations contains: 
•	 The measured magnitude of the property,
•	 The properties of the expected components (rock model),
•	 The volume fractions of the components.
The definition of the expected rock composition (rock model) is a very important step8. Valuable input 
for this step comes from geological knowledge of the investigated formation, core data with respect to 
minerals, and cuttings data with respect to minerals.
Particularly in carbonates with mixture mineralogy some minerals with very strong effect on the measured 
properties (for example high density of anhydrite) can be present.

Water Saturation from logs
The determination of water saturation Sw is – after shale content and porosity – the third key reservoir 
parameter. The difference (1 – Sw) gives the hydrocarbon saturation.
Calcualtion of water saturation applies electrical methods, because formation water is an electrolytic 
conductor and hydrocarbons are insulators. Electrical methods cannot distinguish between gas and oil 
(but the Neutronlog separates oil and gas).
Tools with different radial depth of investigation (deep-reading logs and micrologs) evaluate water 
saturation in the non-invaded (virgin) zone Sw and saturation with mud filtrate Sxo in the invaded 
zone. This technique results in a saturation profile and a determination of movable and non-movable 
hydrocarbons (see example 7.1 Oil-bearing Sandstone).
In clean rocks the formation water (and water-based mud filtrate) is the only conductive component – 
electrical properties are described by Archie’s equations (Archie, 1942). If shale is present, a second 
electrical conductivity component occurs and Archie’s equations must be replaced by a “shaly sand 
equation”. The two dominant cases of shale presence in a rock are laminated and dispersed shale.
5.6.1	
Clean rocks
In a clean reservoir the mud filtrate invasion creates a radial resistivity profile as simplified shown in 
Figure 4-6. Archie’s equations can be applied on both regions:
Non-invaded zone with the conductive formation water (
):
Invaded zone with the conductive mud-filtrate (
):
For a calculation of Sw and Sxo the following inputs are necessary:
a)	 Porosity 
: From porosity logs,
b)	 rchie parameters 
: Core laboratory measurements or recommended values from literature 
(frequently 
),
c)	 Formation water resistivity 
: Derived from a water zone (Sw = 1), from SP-log (as demonstrated 
in example 7.1) or laboratory measurement at a formation water sample,
d)	 Mud filtrate resistivity 
: Measured at a fluid sample and temperature corrected for formation 
depth (see example 7.1).

Shaly sands – shaly rocks 
The presence of shale in a reservoir:
•	 Decreases reservoir quality (porosity, permeability),
•	 Originates an additional electrical conductivity; in most “shaly sand equations” the two 
conductivities are summarized (parallel conductor system), 
•	 “Disturbs” traditional interpretation algorithms and techniques; application of Archie‘s equation 
results in an overestimate of water saturation.
For a correct Sw–calculation from resistivity logs this second conductivity effect therefore must be 
eliminated.
The conductivity contribution of shale/clay depends on:
1)	 Shale content (volume fraction), derived e.g., from Gamma log,
2)	 Shale type (clay mineralogy) controlling the “shale conductivity”,
3)	 Distribution of shale in the formation (laminar shale or dispersed shale).

Lo g Interpretati o n – Introductio
Various “shaly sand equations” have been derived in order to model the different types of shale in a rock; 
only a few members are described in this section. Patchett and Herrick (1982) published a review of 
Saturation Models in a special Shaly Sand Reprint Review Volume of the SPWLA. A systematic overview 
and discussion is published by Worthington (1985).
Laminated Shaly Sand – The Poupon Equation
For the simple case of laminated shaly sand Poupon et al. (1954) derived an equation. The laminated 
shaly sand represents an alternating sand-shale layering with the thickness of the individual layers in the 
mm-range. Resistivity tools cannot resolve individual layers but measure the effect of a parallel conductor 
assuming current lines are parallel to the layering (Figure 5-10)).

The conductivity (the inverse of resistivity) of this parallel conductor model is:
where:
	
is the (laminar) shale content,
	
	
is the shale resistivity,
	
	
is the sand resistivity.
Application of the equation has two steps:
1)	 Calculation of the resistivity of the sand fraction:
	
2)	 Calculation of the water saturation for the sand fraction using Archie’s equation:

Thus, as input the following parameters are necessary:
	
from the log measurement	
	
	
	
resistivity of an adjacent shale bed,
	
shale content e.g., from a Gamma log	
	
	
porosity (from porosity logs),
	
formation water resistivity	
	
	
	
Archie exponents.
…and we must know that the shale is laminated (one possibility to discriminate between laminated and 
dispersed shale/clay is the so-called Thomas-Stieber plot (see end of this chapter).
Figure 5-11 shows the result of a forward calculation of formation resistivity 
 as a function of water 
saturation 
 for different laminar shale content 
. It demonstrates that the effect of shale is very 
strong at low water saturation and increases with increasing water resistivity.
Figure 5-11: Formation resistivity Rt as function of water saturation Sw for four different laminar shale contents Vsh. Porosity = 0.2, 
m = n = 2, Rsh = 5 Ohmm. a) Water resistivity = 0.10 Ohmm; b) Water resistivity = 0.02 Ohmm.
An example may demonstrate the laminar shale effect on Sw:
Input data:	
Rt = 4 Ohm m	 	
	
Rsh = 1.5 Ohm m	
	
Vsh = 0.20
	
	
Rw = 0.02 Ohm m	
	
m = n = 2 
	
	
 = 0.18 	
	
	
F = 31
Wrong calculation: We neglect Vsh and apply Archie‘s equation directly:

Lo g Interpretati o n – Introductio
Correct calculation: We consider Vsh and apply Poupon‘s equation:
Conclusion: The shale gives a contribution to the rock conductivity and decreases the resistivity. Shale has 
therefore an effect which acts in the same direction as water (in our example as 9% water). Neglecting 
the shale results in a non-realistically high water saturation (or low hydrocarbon saturation). 
Dispersed Shaly Sand 
If shale is distributed dispersed in the pore space then the “clay conductivity” must be placed in the 
pores at the same location as the pore water. 
Waxman and Smits (1967) developed a model with the “architecture” of Archie’s equation and replaced 
water conductivity 
 by the sum 
, where the second term expresses the shale 
conductivity component.

Thomas-Stieber Crossplot for Shale Type Investigation
Discussion of selected shaly sand equations demonstrates that three “pieces of information” on the shale 
are necessary: 
1.	 Shale content (Vsh),
2.	 Shale and distribution type (Vsh-lam, Vsh-disp),
3.	 Shale properties (R-shale,
).

Thomas and Stieber (1975) proposed a cross plot technique to determine the type of shale distribution 
using only log data. They plot a “porosity tool” (Density log) and a “shale volume tool” (Gamma log). 
Figure 5-13 demonstrates the principle: 
•	 Laminated shaly sand plots along the connection of the two “corner values” for clean sand 
and pure shale
•	 Dispersed shaly sand plots starting at the clean sand point and by filling the pores with clay it 
reaches the end if 
 and all pores are filled.

6	 Some Applications in 
Water Exploration
Borehole geophysical methods are also applied to various problems in water exploration, thermal- and mineral water 
exploration.
This section gives some specific characteristics of this type of application directed on two situations:
•	
Water wells in sediments, granular reservoirs,
•	
Water wells in hard rocks, fractured reservoirs.
In general, borehole measurements for water exploration apply a small number of logs and tools and 
depth of the wells is smaller compared with hydrocarbon exploration. The goal of a measurement in 
many practical applications is:
a)	 Investigation of the lithological profile,
b)	 The detection of aquifers (porous or/and fractured) with exact depth of bed boundaries,
c)	 The control of completion and production.

Thus, the measuring program is significantly cheaper than any hydrocarbon log exploration. But the 
conditions in the investigated formations is also different:
•	 In many cases the profile consists of unconsolidated rocks (sand, shale), but also hard rocks 
with fractures are the target especially in thermal water and mineral water exploration.
•	 The pore or fracture-filling fluid is water with mostly low salinity (except mineral water). 
Therefore aquifers have relatively high resistivity compared with shale beds. This high water 
resistivity results in a high sensitivity of rock resistivity with respect to shale content – in a 
fresh water-saturated reservoir a small amount of shale decreases rock resistivity much more 
strongly than in a (deep) reservoir with saline formation water.
Two examples may illustrate typical applications.
6.1	
Water well in an unconsolidated formation
The left part of Figure 6-1 shows a selection of standard logs measured (open hole) in an unconsolidated 
lithology. Gamma log combined with conventional 4-electrode resistivity logs (short and long normal) 
delivers a detailed lithological profile following the rules:
•	 Sand (aquifer): Low gamma and high resistivity,
•	 Shale: High gamma and low resistivity (clay conductivity).
Sand (aquifer) layers are marked and the completion design (screened sections) is derived.
After completion a second series of logs was measured (right part of Figure 6-1): Temperature log and 
different modes of flowmeter.
Flowmeters measure the (vertical) flow speed of the water in the well. Frequently an impeller flowmeter 
is used in water exploration. The rotations of an impeller per second are a measure of the velocity of 
the fluid (water) relative to the tool. In case of a continuous measurement (tool is moving with constant 
speed) the measured flowmeter rate (rot/sec) gives the sum of the two velocities (water flow and tool 
speed). Therefore registration of tool speed for correction is part of a flowmeter measurement.

Figure 6-2 shows the measuring principle and the two modes for water wells.
•	 Flow profile (left figure): The tool (with a packer disk) moves downward. There is a high rate 
as result of an inflow from aquifer A and aquifer B and from the speed of the tool in the upper 
section. Below aquifer A the measured signal results only from aquifer B and from the speed of 
the tool. And below aquifer B there is no inflow – the measured signal represents the tool speed 
effect. This curve allows a quantitative description of the inflow (inflow profile). If aquifers are 
not artesian a pump above the uppermost aquifer can activate the inflow.
•	 Hydraulic function of screens (right figure): This mode controls the hydraulic function of the 
completion. The well is completed. The down going flowmeter gives the highest flowrate within 
the tube because all displaced water must pass the sensitive impeller section. If the tool passes 
a permeable screened section, a part of the displaced water flows behind the screen crossing 
the permeable gravel pack. Thus, a step to a low flowrate indicates a screened section with 
good permeability. If the gravel pack is not permeable then the step is less steep and indicates 
the well completion is of low hydraulic quality.

Mineral water well in a fractured carbonate formation
A well for mineral water exploration was drilled in a carbonate formation. Figure 6-3 shows selected logs: 
Gammalog (API), Deep Resistivity log (Ohmm), Acousticlog (compressional velocity in m/s) and the 
Flowmeter measurement during pumping (in cps). Cuttings show marl/breccia, dolomite and limestone.
Interpretation:
•	 The Gammalog separates marl/breccia 600 … 619 m, carbonate 619 … 680 m,
•	 Resistivity indicates a porous/fractured carbonate section from 621 … 645 m followed by a 
dense section,
•	 The Acousticlog confirms a fractured section 621 … 445 m with vp ≈ 4000 m/s followed by a 
dense section with vp ≈ 7000 m/s.
Thus the hydraulically active zone is the dolomite from 621 m to 645 m. A Flowmeter measurement 
(pump was located at a depth of 600 m) confirms the inflow in this section; spikes on the log result from 
caliper irregularities in the open well.

In this section three log example are discussed. Numerical calculations are implemented in order to apply equations 
and rules.
Please note that the same algorithms are applied in software packages. Therefore, the same parameters (for example, 
rock components/minerals, mineral and fluid parameter) are also necessary as input in these sophisticated programs.
The first example is an oil-bearing (clean) sandstone. Goal of the exercise is the derivation of a lithologic profile and the 
calculation of porosity and fluid saturations including derivation of Rw from log data.
The second example is a shaly sandstone. Goal of the exercise is the characterization of the shale component in the 
reservoirs and its effect on water saturation determination.
The third example is the analyse of a mixture carbonate profile. Goal of the exercise is the simultaneous calculation of 
mineral composition and porosity.
7.1	
Oil-bearing Sandstone 
The example is a North African Well. The profile consists of sand (reservoir) with some authigenic clay 
and parts with silty material. Non-reservoir zones are shale and anhydrite layers.
Goal of this exercise: 
•	 Lithologic profile with description of reservoirs,
•	 Compilation of input parameters for quantitative interpretation,
•	 Determination of porosity,
•	 Determination of water saturation; derivation of hydrocarbon saturation,
•	 Determination of moveable and non-moveable oil saturation.

A look on the Gammalog and SP-log indicates this section as shale with some stability problems. The 
correction term for density-derived porosity DRHO is very high (up to – 0.23) and does not allow any 
further quantitative density interpretation.
The “Lithology logs” GR and SP clearly separate sand and shaly zones of the section. The following 
profile can be derived:
•	 Shale zone from top to 8784 ft; bad hole.
•	 The zone from 8784 to 8795 ft is characterized by correct Caliper, low GR, PEF of about 5 b/e, 
extremely high resistivity, very low NPHI and extremely high RHOB (data in LAS-file show 
> 2.9 g cm-3), and low DT. All these indications – particularly the density – are typical of 
anhydrite. It forms a cap rock covering the reservoir.
•	 Sand zone (reservoir) from 8795 to 8910 ft. with shaly/silty interlayers at 8822 to 8826 ft, 8876 
to 8879 ft9. – PEF confirms a (quartz) sand with 1.8 p/e. The log plot shows Neutron porosity 
in the porosity column. NPHISS is plotted from 0 to 0.5 and Density RHOB from 2.65 gcm-3 
to 1.83 gcm-3. Thus, the fit of Neutron- and Density-Porosity is indicative for a sandstone.
•	 The following zone is a shaly sand (increase of GR).
The Neutron-Density crossplot (Figure 7-2) confirms the lithological units.

Figure 7-2: Neutron-Density crossplot: Most data points are close to the sandstone line (porosity 15 … 
20%); data points in the upper right part are influenced by the shale section and caliper. Note that there are 
also some data points in the lower left corner indicating anhydrite.
For the following quick-look interpretation of resistivity, it is important to note that the reservoir is 
characterized by a nearly constant porosity of about 20% – it is a homogeneous reservoir.
The resistivity 
 below 8855 ft is very low (0.02 … 0.04 Ohmm); this indicates a very high salinity and 
a strong contrast to the mud filtrate resistivity (therefore SSP is very high – about 200 mV). 
From a depth of 8800 ft upwards, the resistivity 
 increases by a factor of about 10. 
 is still below 
 (
 is controlled by low saline mud filtrate). This increase of 
 must be originated by a decrease 
of water saturation (because porosity is constant). This part is probably the transition zone. From 8834 
ft to 8795 ft, the reservoir is above transition zone. 
The nearly constant level of 
 (and MSFL) confirms reservoir homogeneity and clearly indicates 
invasion as a result of permeability.

In section 4.2.7 the connection between SSP (static spontaneous potential) and the ratio of the resistivity 
of the mud filtrate to the resistivity of the formation water 
 was described as:
where the factor 
 is mainly controlled by temperature; this dependence is presented in the nomogram 
in Figure 7-3.
Log shows a maximum SSP difference of SSP = -100 mV. At the formation temperature of T = 178 °F 
the circle in Figure 7-3 results in a ratio:
 = 0.012 Ohmm 
This is in confidence with the value from the water zone and confirms the very high salinity of 
formation water.

7.2.2	
Step 1 Selection of zones of Interest
A first visual interpretation of Figure 7-6 shows:
•	 Upper part (1860 … 1907 m): Shale with GR ൎ 60 API, caliper enlarged. The fit of the two 
resistivities (no invasion) and the separation/crossover of Neutron and Densitylog confirm 
shale.
•	 Middle part (1907 … 1966 m): More sandy and more shaly layers alternate. Shaly layers are 
indicated by high GR and separation/crossover of Neutron and Density log. The sandy layers 
with low GR, fit of Neutron and Density log and high Rt are probably oil-bearing layers. In the 
figure only four layers are selected. Note: High Rt indicates hydrocarbon (or less water) and 
the fit of Neutron and Density indicates oil (gas would show a crossover Neutron < Density).
•	 Lower part (below 1966 m): Sand (low shale content), water-bearing. The low Resistivity 
ILD indicates water saturation. Note also the fit of Neutronlog (sandstone referenced) and 
Densitylog.
7.2.3	
Step 2: Determination of shale properties
Because reservoir zones are shaly, a determination of shale properties as input for shaly sand interpretation 
is necessary. Relevant shale parameters are:
a)	 Shale content,
b)	 Type of shale (laminar or dispersed),
c)	 Shale properties: Shale resistivity, wet shale neutron porosity, wet shale density.
Shale content is calculated from GR in two steps: 
1.	 Calculation of “Gamma ray-Index” with GR, min = 20 API GR, max = 80 API.
2.	 Application of the Larionov equation.
A Thomas-Stieber plot (Figure 7-7) indicates laminated shaly sand.

Mixed lithology Carbonate rock
This example demonstrates the determination of porosity and rock composition (minerals) from a

Example uses data from the textbook “Basic Well Log Analysis” (Asquith and Krygovski, 2004); see also: 
http://www.elsevierdirect.com/companion.jsp?ISBN=9780444537966
Data base
The section 9200 to 9252 ft consists of mixed-lithology carbonate rocks. Cored sections (9302 … 9358 ft) 
show dolomite, microcrystalline limestone and anhydrite. Table 7-9 lists the used logs and Table 7-10

Quick look interpretation:
•	 Caliperlog shows a correct caliper, no breakouts or other critical parts.
•	 Gammalog with low magnitude (15 API in the upper part and 30 API in the lower part) 
characterizes the section as nearly clean carbonate.

Examples and Exercises
•	 The porosity logs Neutron porosity NPHI (limestone-calibrated) and Density RHOB (also 
limestone referenced) show no fit in the whole section. The following conclusions result:
οο The section is not a pure limestone,
οο The upper part (down to 9202 ft) is anhydrite (RHOB = 2.95 g cm-3, NPHI ≈ 0),
οο Below 9202 ft a variation of porosity can be expected: Porous zones are presebt at, for 
example, 9204 … 9208 ft, dense zones, for example, at 9210 … 9214 ft. The porosity 
variation is also indicated by the resistivity curve (especially in RMFSL ≈ Rxo).
οο The two resistivity curves show (below 9236 ft) the same shape and nearly the same level 
in the lower section. This section is probably water-saturated (remember 
 and 
 
are of the same magnitude). Above 9236 ft the two curves separate with 
 
and indicate the presence of hydrocarbon. The behaviour of Neutronlog and Densitylog 
characterize the hydrocarbon as oil.

Table 7-12: Rock mineralogy and porosity for the three selected points (matrix inversion).
With the same principle the volumetric composition is calculated for the whole section (Figure 7-13) by 
the computer program. Sections with higher dolomite content show a tendency towards higher porosity 
PHI, probably as result of a dolomitization process. Higher limestone content tends to lower porosity PHI.
7.3.4	
Saturation calculation
For the water saturation calculation Archie’s equation can be applied because of extremely low or no 
shale content and high water salinity or low 
.
With Archie parameters 
 and 
 = 0.023 Ohmm the water saturation results as:
Bulk Volume Water (
)and Bulk Volume Oil (
) are plotted in Figure 
7-13. The Oil-Water contact at 9235 ft is exactly at the depth where the 
 and

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

1.	
Please note: Saturation and bulk volume fluid give only an information about the volume fraction, but 
not about the position or distribution ofthe fluids in the pore space. This is controlled mainly by the 
wettability (see Tiab and Donaldson 2014, Schön 2011).
2.	
Horizontal means parallel to layering or lamination, vertical means orthogonal to the plane of layering 
or lamination.
3.	
The “macroscopic” pressure gradient refers to the sample dimension, whereas a “microscopic” pressure 
gradient refers to the true pore channels length.
4.	
Note: Highly resistive zones within a reservoir are of special interest because of hydrocarbons.
5.	
this technique eliminates the travel time crossing the mud parts of the way.
6.	
Note: The individual plots are designed for specific tools and different fluid properties (water) on top of 
the crossplot.
7.	
The matrix inversion algorithm is a tool in Microsoft-Excel.
8.	
note: The algorithm delivers a mathematically exact solution also in case of a non-realistic composition!
9.	
Note the crossover of Neutron and Density. The low SP-indication could result from lower vertical 
resolution compared with GR and from some permeability (silty), because resistivity curves do not indicate 
a non-permeable layer.
10.	
Compare with the picked value of 0.3 for the water zone.
