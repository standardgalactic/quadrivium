Praise for Advanced Google AdWords
Brad gets it! He has a wealth of hands-on experience and shares it freely. If you want 
to drive and convert Google AdWords traffic, you need to read this book—now!
—Tim Ash, CEO of SiteTuners, Author of Landing Page Optimization, 
Chairperson of Conversion Conference
Brad Geddes is the clearest voice on Advanced AdWords teachings, tactics, and strate-
gies. I’m constantly referring to Brad’s articles and sharing them with others to help 
our clients make tens of thousands of dollars in their PPC campaigns—so be sure to 
grab a copy of Brad’s new book.
One of the best things I like about Brad’s knowledge is that he is constantly 
sharpening his blade by teaching (Google’s Seminar for Success, AdWords advanced 
courses) and doing (running his own campaigns), so his writing reflects his deep 
knowledge of the intricacies and details which, when followed, lead to improved cam-
paign results.
There are a handful of books on the market that give you a broad understanding 
of the psychology behind how to advertise on Google; in Advanced Google AdWords 
Brad gives you that plus a practical, step-by-step plan to leverage what you’ve learned 
by including the technical details you need to turn your knowledge into action.
—Timothy Seward, Founder and CEO, ROI Revolution, Inc. 
This book translates years of successful experience into language anyone can learn 
from to improve their skill level and understand paid search at a higher level. For 
years Brad has been my go-to source for the hardest of AdWords questions no one else 
could answer. Understanding the evolution of paid search is key to taking advantage 
of the nuances and complexities of current search algorithms. Brad does the impos-
sible by teaching you high-level skills that will equate to actionable strategies you can 
apply immediately. He describes the life cycle of paid search and most importantly 
how to create a strategy from this understanding that applies to you. Brad has stayed 
fresh and documented his decade of experience, and he teaches people with a patience 
level acquired from years of teaching in person that results in attention to detail that 
will be hard to find in any other book on the subject. The money you will save on 
understanding Quality Score alone makes buying this book a no-brainer.
—Capt. Todd Malicoat, SEO Faculty at Market Motive 

I’m not going to lie. I’m jealous. This is the AdWords book I wish I had written. I’ve 
been following and learning from Brad Geddes for years, and without a doubt, this is 
the single most useful, detailed, and comprehensive book on AdWords available.
Who is this book for? Absolutely everyone who uses Google AdWords. Not 
only will beginners get a lot from this book, but seasoned professionals with years of 
experience will pick up a lot more than a few nuggets.
This is it. This is the AdWords book that others will try to match. This is the 
only book about AdWords you will ever need. Brad has brought something truly use-
ful to the advertising community.
—Dave Davis, Marketing Director and AdWords TC, Redfly Digital
Brad Geddes has a knack for translating complex concepts into easy-to-understand 
information. I’ve heard Brad speak many times over the years and always send my 
staff to his Seminars for Success. I’m thrilled that he’s published a book that my team 
can use as a manual on an ongoing basis. Advanced Google AdWords is a superb 
overview of Google AdWords. It starts at a beginner level and goes step-by-step 
through the strategies and tactics for setting up and managing campaigns. The book 
also includes plenty of advanced content, even covering topics like Google’s Display 
Network, image and video ads, and understanding reporting data. Specific screen-
shots and examples are included, which help illustrate each point. Advanced Google 
AdWords should be required reading for anyone, at any experience level, who’s adver-
tising on AdWords. 
—Stacy Williams, CEO, Prominent Placement, Inc.

you want insights on Google AdWords? This book has the answers that you are look-
ing for! Neat, precise, and concise in presentation. Rich in content. This is THE book

the better. Advanced Google AdWords Third Edition contains new, detailed, and 
clear examples never seen before. The sooner you open the book, the sooner you’ll see 
results. Buy it for your entire team.
—Michael Stebbins, CEO, Market Motive Training Institute

Authoritative AdWords knowledge comes from few places. Two of them are Google 
and Brad Geddes.
—Rob Sieracki, Strategist and Cofounder at Ox Optimal 
What separates Advanced Google AdWords from the others on the bookshelf is the 
brilliance of the author and the wealth of experience he has in the search industry. 
Brad Geddes is well known among other leaders in search and is often sought for his 
expert opinion on AdWords campaigns and optimizing campaign performance by 
decreasing spend while increasing overall ROI. He has consulted online advertising 
agencies on setting up keyword taxonomies, written articles for major search news 
websites, and collaborated with Fortune 500 companies on the implementation and 
performance of their PPC initiatives. Frankly stated, Brad is frequently sought for his 
insights on all areas of search because he knows what works and, more importantly, 
he knows how to explain paid search strategies to any audience regardless of level of 
experience. I am thrilled that Brad has written this book, and I, as well as you, will 
use this tool frequently. 
—Michael Martin, Director of Product Management and Development at 
Morgan & Corinth, Inc. 
How do you build a better masterpiece? Could the Mona Lisa be improved? Even 
da Vinci would say no, yet master AdWords artist Brad Geddes has topped his first 
classic guide, Advanced Google AdWords. The third edition is chock-full of updates, 
changes, and new information. It’s a must-read for any PPC manager who NEEDS 
to stay on top of every move and pivot Google makes with the world’s most popular 
online advertising platform. 
—David Szetela, Owner and CEO, FMB Media 
When it comes to Google AdWords, Brad Geddes is one of the top minds in the 
business.
—Danny Sullivan, Founding Editor, Search Engine Land 
If you spend money on Google AdWords, it would be foolish not to read Brad 
Geddes’s Advanced Google AdWords Third Edition. We have delighted our clients 
and given them an edge on their competitors by using nuggets learned from Brad. He 
has been effectively teaching people how to do AdWords for longer than anybody we 
know. Please do yourself a favor and take advantage of his PPC wisdom.
—Bryan Eisenberg, New York Times best-selling author, Marketing keynote 
speaker

There are many smart Google AdWords experts out there who know their craft inside 
out. However, what makes Brad so unique is his vast experience in teaching literally 
thousands of people advanced AdWords strategies. So not only does he know the best 
strategies and tactics to get a better return from AdWords, but he also knows how 
to communicate these so that you really get it. No one else has this level of skill and 
teaching experience. Read it, apply it, and reap the rewards!
—Philip Shaw, Director, CleverClicks
From the very first time I heard Brad speak, I know he was the ultimate AdWords 
whisperer. His ability to take something as complicated and nuanced as AdWords and 
explain it so well, in such a warm and engaging manner, gives confidence to begin-
ners and motivation to seasoned users. When his book came out, I eagerly snapped 
it up and have read and reread it countless times, each time learning something new. 
Applying his tips has helped skyrocket revenue and has made all the difference in the 
world. The third edition provides even more value, with incredible insights into remar-
keting, ad extensions, modified broad match, and more, all of which can yield signifi-
cant results. I cannot recommend this book highly enough—buy it now!
—Purna Virji, Senior Marketing Manager, Stroll
Brad Geddes is the most trustworthy source of advanced PPC advice I know. His tips 
are deep, actionable, and profitable. Advanced Google AdWords is a must read for 
new and seasoned paid search professionals.
—Alex Cohen, Marketing—GrubHub Seamless
In the world of paid search, the devil truly is in the details: details that can easily over-
whelm even the most seasoned search marketer. Anyone attempting to navigate the 
labyrinth of campaign settings, bidding tactics and strategies, ad extensions, and all 
the other minutiae that are Google AdWords must have a copy of this book close at 
hand. From beginner basics to the most advanced Quality Score theory, Brad covers it 
all with actionable insights that will guide readers to boosted conversions and reduced 
costs. I give a copy of Advanced Google AdWords to every new member of my search 
team—it’s that good.
—Joe Porter, Senior Marketing Manager, Cengage Learning 

Successful PPC campaign organization and management are more complex than one 
would originally think. Thankfully, the author has provided us with a highly practi-
cal, easy-to-understand guide to launching and managing PPC campaigns that will 
simplify the process and increase the likelihood of great results. Brad really opens 
your eyes to not only how but to why things should be done. For instance, in the 
chapter on ad writing you are given proven best practices but also taught how to get 
into the minds of the search prospects and meet them where they are in the sales fun-
nel. Awesome! Whether you’re a beginner or have been running PPC campaigns for a 
while now, you can be sure your head will be exploding with new ways to make your 
campaigns more effective and profitable.
—Stoney deGeyter, CEO, Pole Position Marketing
Brad has been the authority on Google AdWords for years, and this book is the best 
training tool I have seen since Google’s own training on their program. Brad goes 
a step further by explaining everything from where PPC advertising got started to 
advanced optimization techniques. If there is one part that I focused on the most, it 
was keyword and ad group organization. As Brad says, it is the most time-consum-
ing but most rewarding tactic you can use in PPC marketing. If you want to learn 
AdWords, this is a fantastic book to read to get the whole picture.
—Kate Morris, Principal Marketing Consultant, Distilled 
Anyone who has heard Brad speak, been to one of his trainings, or read any of his 
blog posts or publications already knows why he is already considered the authority 
on AdWords. For those who haven’t yet had the pleasure, Advanced Google AdWords 
Third Edition should set the record straight. Brad brings not only the rules and best 
practices you need to be a successful search marketer but also the context and insider 
tips that can come only from a seasoned professional. Any student, marketer, or busi-
ness owner wanting to succeed online will get there a lot quicker and save a lot of 
money in the process by buying this book.
—Rick Galan, Director of Digital Channel Development at Blendtec 
The latest edition of Advanced Google AdWords explains the latest tools, techniques, 
and tactics that will help advertisers be successful with AdWords. Not only does the 
book contain a thorough explanation of the theory and history of search, but it also 
provides detailed, specific instructions on formulation and execution of marketing strat-
egies and tactics as they pertain to Google AdWords. This book has earned a place on 
my desk as one of the premier tools to aid in creating successful AdWords campaigns.
—Melissa Mackey, Search Supervisor at gyro; Search Engine  
Watch Expert Author, Search Advertising 

This is the book on Google AdWords whether you need to learn to conduct AdWords 
campaigns from scratch or you are an accomplished AdWords practitioner using the 
book as your go-to reference book on your desk. Even on rereads I pick up tips large 
and small that reinvigorate my passion to work on campaigns as well as boost the per-
formance of the campaigns I work on.
—Tim Mayer, Chief Marketing Officer, Trueffect 
Brad has made a lot of people a lot of money in some of the most competitive markets 
of PPC marketing. Now he’s put all his knowledge into one book. Buy and read this 
book before your competitors do!
—Adrian Bye, Founder, MeetInnovators.com
There are many paid search experts out there, but Brad is unique in that he is not just 
an expert but is able to effectively communicate his knowledge to those who are new 
to the field. It is rare to find someone in the industry who has such a deep understand-
ing of a topic that he can teach both the basics and the robust features of paid search.
—Barry Schwartz, CEO of RustyBrick,  
Editor at Search Engine Land and Search Engine Roundtable
Brad Geddes is one of the few AdWords experts I always pay attention to. He’s one of 
the best in the field. This book is incredibly comprehensive, illustrative, and readable. 
Both beginners and experienced pay-per-click marketers will find invaluable insights 
here. Brad fills in a lot of gaps that the AdWords Help screens don’t cover. Otherwise, 
you’d have to get the info from an AdWords rep, and only the biggest spenders get the 
best attention from these reps. Heeding this book’s advice from the start will save you 
a lot of money and get you much better results. Highly recommended.
—Bran Carter, CEO and Lead Consultant at The Carter Group
Brad Geddes is the quintessential AdWords authority.
His love of sharing information and his deep knowledge of pay-per-click sys-
tems makes this book a compelling read.
This book hits the mark by blending practical with creative strategies to help 
you organize, quantify, and present ads for the most effective return on investment.
—Brett Tabke, CEO of Pubcon, Inc.

Brad Geddes takes the reader by the hand, starting with the basics of search engine 
marketing, and then steadily introduces more advanced concepts and more powerful 
tools. I really appreciate his consistent focus on maximizing conversion rates. All the 
traffic in the world won’t help us unless it generates leads and sales. As a primer, a 
field guide, and a reference, this book will be a constant companion for online market-
ers at all levels of experience.
—Brian Massey, The Conversion Scientist
Most books about search advertising show you how to do it. In Advanced Google 
AdWords, paid search expert Brad Geddes takes it to the next level, showing you not 
only how to get the most from your search advertising campaigns but, more impor-
tantly, why you should use specific features and techniques, who you should be target-
ing with your creative, and when to use the scores of advanced tactics he describes for 
maximum impact and profitability. I’d advise buying more than one copy of this book 
because you’ll wear one out from constant use.
—Chris Sherman, Founding Editor, Search Engine Land
Brad Geddes knows marketing, and he understands the inscrutable mind of 
Google—a killer combination when it comes to explaining AdWords. His book is a 
powerful combination of deep insight and simple prescriptions that will help anyone, 
from AdWords novice to seasoned pro, get more clicks and make more sales. I’ve 
never seen a clearer discussion of the buying funnel as it relates to choosing keywords 
and writing ads. Ignore the chapter on Quality Score at your own risk. This book 
raised my game—and I’m sure it’ll do the same with yours.
—Howie Jacobson, Ph.D., Cofounder, VitruvianWay.com and  
Author of Google AdWords For Dummies
For years I have been seeking out the one book that I can turn to both when I need a 
basic refresher and when I tackle more advanced AdWords tactics. Brad Geddes has 
finally provided me with such a resource. In Advanced Google AdWords, Geddes dem-
onstrates his years of expert experience in paid search marketing as he demystifies the 
many components involved with AdWords and shares valuable secrets of those suc-
cessfully dominating the AdWords platform. I can officially say my search is over—if 
you are looking for the one book that will help you drive qualified traffic to your site 
and increase ROI, you just found it!
—Joanna Lord, Joanna Lord, CMO, BigDoor

The word expert gets thrown out there a lot in the digital marketing industry, but 
Brad Geddes is for sure one of our top experts in search engine marketing. I’ve had the 
pleasure to learn from Brad through the years through his various writings and speak-
ing engagements. Bottom line, do you want to know how to win at paid search? Do 
you want to become an advanced AdWords user and make your organization success-
ful at using PPC? Then read this book. Brad has compiled into one resource what it 
would take you a decade to learn by yourself.
—Josh Dreller, Director, Marketing Research and Content, Kenshoo
This is a book you’ll keep on your desk, not your bookshelf. At our agency, I use it as 
an always-available training tool. When I am trying to explain something technical to 
one of our campaign managers, I just say, “Hey, read this chapter in Brad Geddes’s 
book and then let’s talk about it.”
Brad explains advanced optimization in plain, simple language. You read it and 
it makes sense, so you trust it. You read it and you understand it, and so you can put 
it to work on your own campaigns. He makes it seem easy, and that’s the brilliance of 
this book. Even as Google continues to expand and evolve, the techniques shown in the 
book will still be perfectly valid—they are built on a very solid technical foundation.
I highly recommend it to any serious PPC campaign manager. Well done, Brad!
—Matt Van Wagner, President, Find Me Faster
The thing that differentiates this book from other AdWords guides is that it takes you 
inside the mind of a successful paid search advertiser and walks you through each 
and every step of the auction and advertising process. The two consistent strengths 
of the book are its ability to ground the reader in the core goals of their advertising 
program (generating leads and sales through effective targeting and messaging) and its 
relentless attention to detail. That perspective and thoroughness mean that the book is 
accessible to less-sophisticated advertisers and ensure that there is a series of valuable 
nuggets available for intermediate and even expert AdWords users.
—Tom Demers, Managing Partner at Measured SEM LLC
For years, I’ve been recommending Brad Geddes to people who ask me for AdWords 
resources. I’m thrilled to now have Brad’s book Advanced Google AdWords to recom-
mend as well. This book clearly walks through every step of the paid search process in 
accessible, relatable language. Just as importantly, Brad keeps the focus on the audi-
ence. He understands that it’s not enough to know how to create and buy ads and 
ensure they are visible in Google search results. The real goal is to connect your busi-
ness to the right searchers, engage them, and turn them into paying customers. That’s 
what this book will help you do.
—Vanessa Fox, author, Marketing in the Age of Google

Many AdWords advertisers realize that the search and Display Networks need differ-
ent approaches. The problem is that most don’t know how to handle the difference 
so they just ignore the content network. Big mistake. The content network has the 
potential to deliver more visitors with lower CPC’s. Brad does a great job in breaking 
down, with a flowchart no less, how the approach to the content network differs and 
how to implement a winning content network strategy. Brad even goes a step further 
by showing you how to put a laser focus on certain content network sites to get the 
most out of what is available. If you want to boost your content performance, you 
need to listen to what Brad has to say and follow in his footsteps.
—Rob Lenderman, Founder, Boost CTR
Brad is the go-to guru for AdWords. Advanced Google AdWords is actionable, is 
readable, and has tons of handy tips that any online advertiser can try immediately. 
Even if you think you know everything about Quality Score or the Google Display 
Network, you’ll find things you haven’t thought about that can boost your sales right 
away.
—Ron Drabkin, Head of Growth and Monetization, Healthtap.com
Very few people have the grasp and understanding of Google’s Display Network or 
the ability to use words and illustrations to make it look so easy. From best practices 
to organizing your campaigns to the importance of placement performance reports, 
you’ll find it step by step in Advanced Google AdWords.

Acknowledgments
Writing this book has been an amazing journey, and there are many who 
deserve a heartfelt thank-you for contributing to this quest being completed.
The first edition of Advanced Google AdWords came out four years ago. 
AdWords has changed so much in those four years and significantly since the second 
edition came out two years ago that there is very little content left in the book from 
that first edition. At times this edition was a huge undertaking because entire chap-
ters needed to be completely rewritten. 
Luckily, I had Matt Van Wagner, the technical editor who tirelessly checked 
every fact, calculation, and word. I’ve respected Matt for a number of years as we’ve 
spoken to each other across the country. After working with Matt on the last two 
editions of this book, not only do I have a higher respect for him, but the book is 
much better because of his dedication to this edition. Thank you, Matt.
I must always thank Sharon, my wife, who has supported my various adven-
tures over the years no matter how insane they sounded. During the creation of the 
first edition, our daughter, Lilith Rose, was born. Four years later, Lilith still makes 
it difficult for me to tear myself away from her to finish the book, and many pages 
were written while she was giving her interpretation of marketing.
Thank you to my business partner, Leslie Clark, for keeping the company run-
ning while I was off writing and regularly ignoring the tasks at hand. It’s been her 
support in growing the company that has made it possible for works like this to be 
created.
After three years, I am still impressed with the team at Wiley. Willem Knibble 
had the idea to write a book on AdWords and the foresight to keep me moving 
toward a third edition. He provided input and assistance whenever necessary. Thank 
To Vernice, you were a wonderful inspiration and will be sorely missed.

you, Kim Wimpsett, Dassi Zeidel, and all the others who worked in the background 
for taking my thoughts and making them comprehensible and putting them to paper. 
The teams at Google have not just given me support for the writing of this 
book; they have been giving me support for more than a decade, and for that I 
thank them.
Finally, I must thank the Internet marketing community. I have been writing, 
speaking, and blogging about online marketing for many years. During that time, 
I have been an active participant in forums, blogs, and conferences. My interac-
tion with the community, made up of significantly more people than I could ever 
acknowledge on paper, has helped to increase everyone’s understanding and success 
with Google AdWords.


Brad Geddes has been involved in online marketing for more than a decade. Over 
the years he has provided a variety of services, the most common being usability, search 
engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click (PPC), product development, product position-
ing, agency consulting, and affiliate marketing. 
One of his trademarks has been demystifying the more complicated aspects of SEO, 
PPC, and Internet advertising through writing, speaking, and training. Not one to hold 
secrets, Brad prefers to educate readers on the various aspects of crafting successful mar-
keting campaigns to ensure the success for all parties involved. 
Brad does not call himself an expert or guru. He prefers to educate marketers and 
let the results speak for themselves. Therefore, instead of writing paragraphs that use the 
words master, wizard, or thought leader and name-drop companies he has worked with

ting the intelligent readers make up their own mind based on what they learn.

As a lover of marketing and the art of influence, I’m excited about every media 
channel available to us. It is pretty cool to see creativity expressed in billboards you pass 
as you drive around (or, lucky you, are driven around!). It is amazing to see the hyper-
fragmentation of TV content and audiences (if you are looking for people age 30–45 who 
earn around $60,000 per year, go on cruises with their dogs, and are vegan, there is a 
channel for them on TV!). I’m sure you’ve been impressed with radio’s capability to draw 
audiences (and not just when they are trapped in their cars!). 
With all that said and done, I’m perhaps most excited about the immense possibili-
ties that digital presents for our companies to find people, influence them, deliver relevant 
content, and exchange happiness for conversions. Think about it for a second. How cool 
is that!
And for all the audience-targeting awesomeness, the ability to pay just a penny 
more than the competition to show your ads, the crazy scale at which you can customize 
the ad creative (almost down to a person!), and the sheer intelligence you can infuse into 
your marketing and advertising … I’m crazy mad in love with one possibility: the ability 
to discern intent.
Even if you are the right demographic and psychographic for my company and 
are watching my company’s ad for the 900th time on TV, I have no idea if you have any 
intention of buying anything (you just bought a new car/TV/pants/trip!). With digital this 
is less of a problem or not a problem at all.
On the Web your behavior is a strong signal of intent. Nowhere is this truer than 
with search. I, as a marketer, don’t have to guess anymore. Hundreds of millions of peo-
ple are on a search engine every single day, raising their proverbial hands, and saying, Sell 
to me!
Intent.
Your job, nay, your duty on behalf of your company is to identify that intent and to 
deliver the optimal message (via the AdWords ad and its awesome collection of ad exten-
sions) back to the searcher and say, I will sell to you, and here’s what’s great about our 
products/services.
For the second time, how cool is that!
Google and other search engines make it easy for you to get going. They make it 
easy for you to start, to run your initial cluster of ads, and to get your first few wins. 
But search engine marketing is a complex field with enough options to scare you or, 
if you can master them, allow you to create a sustained competitive advantage with huge 
profit upside for your company.

If you don’t want to be scared (which sadly often results in the folding of your busi-

Customer Centricity and Web Analytics: An Hour a Day

Advanced Google AdWords is written for people who have a solid 
understanding of AdWords and have opened and managed their own 
account. What you will not find is information on how to open an 
account or navigate through the interface, or introductory material 
on keywords. These basics can be found in the AdWords Learning 
Center for free. 
This book begins where most blogs and training leave off—optimization for inter-
mediate and expert users. There are so many options with AdWords that it can be diffi-
cult to determine where to start or to understand what is possible. For instance, you could 
create an ad for a smartphone that is shown to a consumer only if 
••
The consumer is in the business section of the New York Times. 
••
The article being read is about stock brokers. 
••
The consumer is on a mobile device.
••
The consumer is located in Minneapolis. 
••
The time is between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. 
While rarely will you want an ad shown under such stringent conditions, choosing 
one or two of those options to constrain your ad serving to reach your ideal customer will 
help you save marketing dollars. And best yet, you will be putting the correct ad in front 
of your target market. 
Of course, there is more to AdWords than image ads and the Display Network. 
We start with search and end with step-by-step instructions. We will dive into detailed ad 
copy and landing page testing, account organization, ad copywriting, and even multiple 
strategies for setting bids. 
You will find one of the most comprehensive sections ever written on Quality 
Score. If you have been advertising with Google for a while and either do not know what 
Quality Score is or have had issues with high first-page bids or low Quality Scores, this 
book is definitely for you. 
If you are an advanced user and wondering if you can learn from this book, just flip 
to the last chapter. There you will find a step-by-step guide for creating and optimizing 
AdWords accounts. Every single section in that chapter is the cumulation of what you will 
learn throughout this book. 
This book’s two mantra words are creativity and profits. To be creative with 
AdWords you need to understand your options and how various settings influence other

settings. To increase profits you need to understand testing, conversions, and bidding strate-
gies. When you combine creativity and profits, you will stop just advertising and spending 
money. Instead, you will put the correct ad in front of your ideal customer at the time when 
they are most likely to convert so that your company can increase their overall profits. 
What You Will Learn
This book does not just tell you how a feature works but also gives you strategies into 
using that feature. For instance, most national companies ignore location targeting. This 
is a mistake. Did you know you can buy a diet beer in Japan? Try selling a diet beer to 
Americans. You cannot buy Coke Lite in the United States or Diet Coke in Europe. Why? 
The words diet and lite evoke different feelings in different geographies. This book will 
give you strategies to determine your conversion rate and spend for different geographies, 
how to test different ads by geography, and how to maximize your returns in each geogra-
phy where you are advertising. 
Not everything is about location. This book examines how to find, measure, 
change, test, and implement strategies for a variety of topics including the following: 
••
Keywords 
••
Ad copy 
••
Quality Score 
••
Time-of-day targeting 
••
Testing ad copy 
••
Testing landing pages 
••
Profit by impression testing 
••
Account organization 
We will go through the steps of helping you to learn where to best spend your time. 
With so many options it can be difficult to determine where to start. We will help by not 
just showing you where to spend your initial time but also showing how to set up report-
ing schedules so that you can continue to grow and optimize your account. 
By reading this book, you will learn step-by-step strategies that will increase your 
company’s profits through using Google AdWords. 
What Is Covered in This Book 
Since Google AdWords is so complex, this book is intended to be used in two ways. First, 
read it straight through to learn how to use account strategies. Once you have read it, 
then you can use this book as a reference as you are optimizing your account. 
Each chapter ends with a best-practice section that contains easy-to-comprehend 
points about the subject material to quickly refresh your memory. The last chapter of this 
book is a step-by-step guide to getting things done. Refer to that chapter when you are

Understanding 
Search Theory
The search process may seem simple: A searcher 
visits a search engine, enters a search query, and 
receives results. Every step of the search pro-
cess, however, is accompanied by the searcher’s 
thoughts and expectations. Understanding how 
your keywords and ads align themselves with 
the search process can help bring more visitors 
to your site and achieve more conversions from 
those visitors.
Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising is effective 
because it mirrors the search process, and the two 
work seamlessly with each other. Understanding 
the origins and evolution of PPC advertising will 
also give you a glimpse into its future, so you can 
continue to take advantage of this ever-expanding 
form of advertising.

The Origins of Google AdWords
In 1996, a small company was formed that would forever change the world of Internet 
marketing. This company was called Idealab. It took two years of hard work and cre-
ative ideas before Bill Gross’s company would launch GoTo.com with a simple business 
model: Advertisers could choose to display their ads based on what a searcher was 
trying to find. A searcher would type a query into the search box (Figure 1.1), and if 
advertisers chose to advertise on that word, their ad would show in the search results. 
Four simple concepts made this business model revolutionary.
Figure 1.1  GoTo.com’s search page, circa 1998
The first was relevance, a word later adopted by Google throughout their 
AdWords program. Showing ads based on what someone was actively seeking made 
these new search ads more relevant than anything previously displayed on the Internet.
Note:  AdWords is Google’s pay-per-click program where an advertiser chooses words that will trigger their 
ad. The advertiser is charged only if their ad is displayed and clicked by a searcher. This unique pricing model not 
only ensures that an advertiser’s message is seen but that the advertiser pays only when someone arrives at their 
website.
Advertisers would only choose to display their ads on keyword searches that 
were related to their products or services. Since their ads would then only be shown 
when someone was searching for related information, these ads would help the search-
ers find what they were seeking.

Before the days of PPC, the ads alongside a search results page were often ban-
ner ads that had nothing to do with the search query. While these ads did gather many 
impressions (an “impression” is when an ad is shown on a page), they were not relevant 
to the user and thus were rarely clicked. Advertisers were paying for exposure but were 
not receiving much traffic for their ad dollars.
In the early days of Google, before AdWords launched, the founders of Google 
had been questioned many times by their investors about how they would eventually 
monetize their search engine. At that time, the founders did not have an answer; how-
ever, they held steadfast to the belief that at the moment someone was shown a page 
of search results, Google had their undivided attention. It would be in that moment 
of someone scanning a page of search results that Google would make its money. It 
turned out to be an accurate observation by the early Googlers.
By displaying ads based on what someone was actively seeking, GoTo.com 
formed a synergy between searchers and advertisers that helped both reach their goals 
on a single search page. Advertisers would receive visitors who were actively seeking 
their products, and searchers would find products that were related to what they were 
seeking. This was a win for both searchers and advertisers.
The second concept was the pricing model. Previously, almost all advertisements 
were based on paying for impressions. A company would decide how many impres-
sions they would like to buy for their banner ads, and then they would pay on a cost 
per thousand impressions (CPM) basis. This created a scenario where you had to have 
a large advertising budget to even sign an initial contract. In addition, you had no idea 
how many visitors or sales those ads would bring to your site. The world of Internet 
advertising was mostly formed by larger companies or companies with venture capital 
backing.
By changing to a PPC pricing model, advertisers paid only when they received 
traffic. This shift to performance-based advertising allowed companies to try a fledg-
ling business model with little monetary commitment. The minimum monthly spend 
was roughly $1 per day, a big change from minimums that were often several thousand 
dollars a month.
Because search engines were paid only when a click occurred, it also forced 
search engines to show only relevant ads. If an ad did not get clicked, the search engine 
did not make money. The pricing model helped reinforce that only relevant ads should 
be shown on a search results page. This forced advertisers and search engines to work 
together to create a better search page for the consumer.
The third concept—and how Yahoo!, Bing, and Google have built a base of 
more than a million advertisers—was the signup process. GoTo.com removed the bar-
rier of a salesperson between the advertiser and the inventory. Using a self-serve ad 
model, any advertiser could sign up for a PPC account and start selecting keywords 
and creating ad copy within minutes (Figure 1.2).

Chapter 1:  U n dersta n di ng Se a rch T h eory  ■

Figure 1.2  The AdWords signup process is a simple wizard influenced by GoTo.com.
By choosing a self-serve model, a search engine did not have to pay commission 
to a salesperson. There were no contracts to sign, no insertion orders (IOs) to fax, and 
no phone calls to be made before you could start advertising on the Web. This straight-
forward approach allowed anyone, from a small business to a Fortune 500 company, to 
quickly experiment with Internet advertising.
The Internet was still a new concept to most people, and both companies and 
consumers were unsure how widely adopted the Web would become. Thus, having the 
ability to commit a few dollars and experiment with the new medium was paramount 
to introducing thousands of new companies to the concept that they could make money 
on the Web.
It also enabled the search engines to scale their advertiser base quickly. People 
often slow down the advertising process, and allowing a self-serve model meant that 
the only barrier to advertising was a bit of time and a credit card.
The last concept is what has allowed Yahoo!, Bing, and Google to make bil-
lions of dollars from their advertisers—the auction process. GoTo.com did not have a 
set price for what you needed to pay when a keyword was clicked in a search result. 
Advertisers set a price of what they were willing to pay, and the company willing to 
pay the most showed up highest in the search results.

If you were willing to pay more than your competitors, then your ad would 
show higher in the search results, which would gather more clicks and bring more visi-
tors to your website. It is easy to see how the top positions were highly coveted.
The process has become much more complex over the years as search engines, 
users, and advertisers have become savvier.
In October 2001, GoTo.com, Inc., renamed itself Overture Services. In 2003, 
Overture was acquired by Yahoo! for $1.63 billion. In 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! 
formed the Search Alliance. With this new deal, Yahoo! would now serve ads from 
Microsoft’s adCenter platform, now known as Bing Ads, and the original PPC engine 
would no longer be used by anyone.
Yahoo! vs. Google
In 2001, GoTo.com was awarded the patent titled “System and method for influencing a position on 
a search result list generated by a computer network search engine.” This patent is the heart of PPC 
advertising technology. In April 2002, Overture sued Google over patent infringement. The lawsuit 
dragged on for two years, during which Yahoo! acquired Overture, until it was time for Google to 
transform into a public company. Not wanting to go public with a major lawsuit that threatened its 
revenue, Google finally settled with Yahoo! by issuing 2.7 million shares of stock in exchange for a 
perpetual license to the patent.
Today, GoTo.com is an unknown name to most people; in fact, GoTo.com is 
no longer owned or operated by Yahoo! and has changed hands a few times over the 
years.
As described earlier, GoTo.com’s four founding concepts were quite simple: 
­relevance, pay-per-click pricing, self-service, and auction-based pricing. However, these 
principles were combined not only to quickly gain advertiser adoption, but also to reap 
the monetary benefits of advertiser competition for the top ad positions.
Google Enters the Arena
In 1998, when GoTo.com was first launching, Google’s search engine was just renamed 
from BackRub and was running on Stanford University servers. Creators Larry 
Page and Sergey Brin were more concerned with moving their operations into Susan 
Wojcicki’s garage than making money.
Note:  Susan Wojcicki’s garage served as Google’s first workspace away from Stanford’s campus. Wojcicki 
was instrumental in Google’s growth when she became one of their early employees and is often referred to as the 
“Mother of AdSense.” (AdSense is Google’s contextual advertising program.)

Chapter 1:  U n dersta n di ng Se a rch T h eory  ■

Over the next two years, Google moved to Mountain View, accepted $25 mil-
lion in funding, and hired key employees to help in their evolution. Their early hires 
revolved around scaling their search technology. Craig Silverstein was their very first 
employee and served as the director of technology. Much of his early work helped scale 
the IT operations that would allow Google to grow. The next step was finding a way to 
start making money.
Google’s first offering was an uninspired CPM program. To advertise with 
Google, you had to talk to a sales rep and sign a contract for a fairly high minimum 
spend. Although advertisers could choose to show an ad based on a searcher’s query, 
the four concepts that had made GoTo.com a success were not to be found.
The high barrier to advertising with Google was lowered in October 2000 
when Google launched their first self-serve advertising program. The simply named 
Google AdWords started with 350 customers. However, AdWords was still bought on 
a CPM basis.
Google AdWords Select Revolutionizes PPC
February 2002 will always be remembered as the time when Google forever changed 
pay-per-click advertising. Google launched AdWords Select, which incorporated all of 
GoTo.com’s founding principles; however, in typical Google fashion, they added their 
own twist to the auction model.
On GoTo.com, the more you paid, the higher your ad appeared in search results. 
That essentially made it so the company willing to pay the most had the highest vis-
ibility. Google’s main advertising word was relevance, and they changed the PPC auc-
tion model both to increase relevance for a searcher and to maximize how much money 
Google made on a search results page.
Their twist was to incorporate click-through rates (CTR) in determining where 
an ad showed up in the results. They used a simple formula to determine ad position: 
maximum CPC (cost per click) multiplied by CTR.
The logic was that if an ad was clicked more often, it was more relevant to the 
searcher, and the advertiser should be rewarded for showing an ad aligned with the 
searcher’s query.
This simple formula also maximized the dollars Google made on every single 
search engine results page (SERP). In the PPC model, a search engine is paid only when 
a click occurs.
On GoTo.com, if advertisers were willing to bid more than everyone else for a 
click, their ads would show up at the top of the search pages. If those same ads did not 
receive clicks, the engines did not actually make money from displaying those ads.
Therefore, a search engine should not display the highest bid ads the most if they 
were not clicked. A search engine would make more money by displaying lower-bid ads 
that gathered clicks than by showing high-cost ads that received few clicks.

The Rise and Fall of RPS
Search engines protect their most important metric, revenue per search (RPS), from public consump-
tion. However, with some rough math the numbers can be approximated. In 2004, Google made 
around $0.10 per search, which increased to $0.19 in 2006, and finally surpassed $0.25 in 2007. 
Conversely, Yahoo!’s revenue per visitor was roughly only $0.16 in 2007. As the economy dipped in 
2009, so did Google’s RPS, to approximately $0.095, which was still higher than Yahoo!’s at that time. 
However, it is difficult to blame the entire dip on the economy. As more information is integrated into 
the search results, there is less of a need for the consumer to always leave the search results page. For 
instance, a search for Chicago weather will show the five-day forecast within the search results, which 
results in fewer people clicking away from the page to find the weather forecast.
Google’s RPS continued to decline for a couple years, but in 2013 it has rebounded to an estimated 
$0.20. However, RPS does not tell the whole story. If you can increase the total number of searches 
that are conducted, then even with a low RPS you can make a significant amount of money. This is 
where Google’s Android operating system and mobile advertising have been so important to search 
engines: capturing the next wave of queries. Among all these changes to consumer behavior, Google’s 
total revenues continue to increase year after year.
By incorporating a combination of bid prices and how many clicks those ads 
received, Google managed to maximize how much they made on any single search 
results page. This simple change also created an environment where a small company 
with a more compelling offer could have its ad displayed higher in a SERP than a large 
national company that did not take the time to create relevant ads. Price no longer 
trumped relevancy. Having the most money did not ensure the most clicks or visibility. 
Advertisers had to choose keywords that were relevant to their products and create ads 
to match.
This level playing field helped spur advertiser adoption to the point that Google 
eventually dropped their CPM program completely and renamed the AdWords Select 
program to the name used today: Google AdWords.
Over the years, Google has become much more sophisticated and has revamped 
their formulas for displaying ads on search pages. However, throughout the growing 
complexities of AdWords, Google has always kept their ad serving synergistic with 
the search process. To understand how to take advantage of aligning your advertis-
ing efforts with Google’s ad serving, it is important to understand the psychology of 
search.
The Psychology of Search
One of the advantages of online advertising is transparency of data to the advertiser. 
It is easy to track click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per conversions, total 

Chapter 1:  U n dersta n di ng Se a rch T h eory  ■
8
conversions, bounce rates, and more data points than anyone could ever analyze. The 
numbers can be overwhelming. Between the reports you can run in AdWords, some sim-
ple Excel formulas, and your analytics program, you can get buried in meaningless data.
It is essential to look beyond the numbers and consider the individuals sitting at 
their anonymous keyboards conducting the searches. While numbers tell the story of 
your marketing, it is the actual people who can make your advertising profitable.
Since search marketing—and Google AdWords in particular—is based on 
people using search engines, you must also think about how search engines are used in 
everyday life. Understanding not only how people use search engines but also how they 
decide to click on an ad from the search page will help align your marketing efforts 
with the searchers. Having someone arrive at your site is just one step in the equation. 
Your website must also be aligned with the searcher’s interest so the searcher does not 
just browse your website but also becomes a new customer.
Search engines are not used to browse the Web. That is the domain of proper-
ties such as My Yahoo!, StumbleUpon, and Twitter. There is more information on the 
Web than anyone could read in dozens of lifetimes, and most of that information is of 
no interest to the searcher. Therefore, people do not just read search engines attempting 
to absorb all the information that has been discovered around the Web. Search engines 
are used when people want to find a specific piece of information. More importantly, 
people use search engines to find answers to questions.
We all think differently. We all ask questions differently. Delving into the vari-
ous ways that people think and ask questions can assist you in choosing keywords that 
will make sure your ad appears in front of someone searching with questions your site 
can answer.
Turning Concepts into Words
The majority of people do not think in words. Words are conventions to relay the 
thoughts that are present in our minds. Although words are how we communicate 
in daily life, they are just a vehicle to help us express the concept of our thoughts to 
others.
People are not mind readers. You cannot think at a person and have that person 
understand your thoughts. You have to take the concepts present in your brain and 
transform them into words so that another person can understand you. The translation 
that occurs from concept to word is different for each person. This is why you might 
readily understand one person and not understand another person who is trying to 
express the exact same idea.
This same process of putting our thoughts into words is also how we communi-
cate with a search engine. Google has not yet developed the technology where you can 
telepathically receive your answer. Therefore, you need to express yourself in the typed 
word to receive a response.

Note:  While Google can’t read your mind, they can interpret more inputs than just text. In 2007, Google 
launched a call-in search named Goog-411 that was open for only a brief period of time. Then in 2009, Google incor-
porated speech to text on Android-powered phones. Then in 2011, Google’s Chrome browser became capable of 
translating speech into search queries. Today, it is not uncommon to see people talking to their phones or comput-
ers to write emails, send text messages, find directions, and much more without ever typing a single word. 
To further the process of examining how people translate their thoughts into 
words, we will use the following scenario and examine some of the ways in which this 
scenario can be typed into a search engine.
Chicago is brutally cold in the winter. Imagine sitting in your suburban house 
watching a movie on a Saturday evening. Suddenly, your spouse tells you that there is 
water flooding the basement. Upon examination, you discover that a pipe has frozen, 
causing it to break, and now you need a plumber to come out to your house to fix the 
problem.
This is a common winter scenario in Chicago. However, the ways in which peo-
ple will attempt to solve this problem are different.
Some people are direct in their thinking. They will go to Google and type in 
the actual question they need to find an answer to, such as Where do I find a Chicago 
plumber? Many people, instead of typing out the entire question, will shorten the 
query to just Chicago plumber or maybe more precisely Schaumburg plumber, or 
emergency plumbing services Schaumburg.
Others will have a preconceived notion about what they want to find, and their 
query will be more aligned with the answer they want to receive. For example, the 
query might be A site about Chicago plumbers.
If you are the do-it-yourself type, you might first want to turn off the water to 
stop the initial problem before contacting a plumber. A search for How to turn off the 
water in my basement would be more appropriate.
What is the root cause of the problem? If you searched for the root cause, the 
site that held the answer could also help you fix the broken pipes. Queries such as bro-
ken pipes or frozen pipes could lead you to your answer. You could also search for the 
actual problem, such as flooded basement.
It can be a useful exercise to walk into the office tomorrow and describe this 
scenario to your coworkers. Then ask each of them what they would type in the search 
box. If you ask them one by one, instead of in a group, you are sure to receive a slightly 
different answer from almost everyone you ask. There will be some repetition, but con-
centrate on the different types of answers.
In fact, there are thousands of ways that someone could search for the answer to 
this scenario. In later chapters, we will dive more into keyword research. Most queries 
usually fall into one of a few categories:

Chapter 1:  U n dersta n di ng Se a rch T h eory  ■
10
For instance, if your computer is slow and is causing you not to be able to create 
large pivot tables in Excel, these would be search queries that match these categories:
••
The actual question, or a shortened version of the question: How do I make my 
computer faster?
••
The answer to the question: Computer memory 
••
A description of the problem: Computer won’t run Excel
••
A symptom of the problem: Slow computer
••
A description of the cause: Out of memory error
••
Product parts or brand names: 8GB, 204-pin SODIMM, DDR3
It is essential that you consider all the ways someone can search for your prod-
ucts. Search queries are thought processes. Understanding someone’s query can give 
you insight into what question they want answered.
Understanding Search Results
Once the thought has been translated into words, it is time to find the answer to the 
question. You go to Google, type in your words, and before you click the Search but-
ton, something psychological happens—expectation setting.
As a human, every time you conduct any action, you have an expectation of 
results. When you first looked at the spine or cover of this book, you had a notion of 
what it contained. Before you bought the book, you had an expectation of what you 
would learn by reading it. Every event also changes and refines those expectations. As 
you read this chapter, you have a different expectation of what you will find later in the 
book than when you first bought it.
This series of ongoing expectation settings also affects how you view search 
engines. When a searcher inputs a query, they expect to see certain ads and websites 
displayed that will help them find the answer to your question.
This same expectation setting happens for every person using a search engine. 
Everyone expects to find websites that will help them answer their question. Therefore, 
before they ever click the Search button, they have already built an idea of what the act 
of typing their query into a search box will bring to their computer screen.
Within the search process, your ad has a specific role. Having your ad appear 
on that search page is not your endgame. Your ad must be relevant to the search result. 
You do not want everyone who sees your ad to come to your website. You want only 
those who are going to engage your company to click on your ads and visit your web-
site. Every click costs money, so you don’t want all the clicks possible—you just want 
the clicks that are more likely to turn into customers.

The Purpose of Ad Copy
Once the Search button is clicked, Google displays a set of ads and websites 
(Figure 1.3). A quick scan of the page will tell the searcher if the results are in line with 
their expectations. If they are not, the searcher is likely to stop reading the results and 
change the search query.

As an advertiser, this brief moment is your chance to connect with the searcher. 
These few seconds can determine whether the searcher will visit your site, visit your 
competitor’s site, or just search again for the answer and completely ignore your ad.
At this moment, your ad needs to stand up, jump around, wave its arms, grab 
the searcher’s attention, and shout, “I have the answer to your question! Come click me 
and I’ll show you the answer.”

Attempting to create ads that both stand out from the crowd to gain initial 
attention and are compelling enough to entice someone to click is a difficult proposi-
tion. As a marketer, you need to write ads that meet the expectations of the searcher 
and yet can communicate to that same person that your website can deliver the answer 
to their question.
AdWords basic text ads are only 130 characters in length, and they have a tre-
mendous amount to accomplish in just a few scant words.
An ad needs to have a headline that draws attention. It needs to stand out from 
other ads on a page that are clamoring for attention. The ad copy needs to tell a visitor 
why you have the answer to their question. And yet, the ad also needs to be faithful 
to your products or services. You can never lose sight of what makes your company 
money; otherwise, you will be paying for clicks that do not help you reach your goals.
Ads should not be written to please the advertiser. They should not be written to 
make the CEO smile. Ads should be written to convey to the searcher that you hold the 
key to their question, and they must first walk through your ad copy to your website 
before they can find out the answer. We will spend time in later chapters discussing 
how to create these ads and even how to test them against each other.
Ideally your ad has caught the searcher’s eye. The searcher thinks your ad can 
lead them to information that will help them complete their quest. And just before the 
searcher clicks on your ad, something else happens—another expectation is being set.
When a person does a search on Google, they have a preconceived notion of 
what they will see on a search results page based on what words they choose to search. 
Your ad copy is the only thing a user knows about your website; therefore, those few 
characters are also setting the user’s expectations about what they will find on the first 
page on your site they encounter, which is your “landing page.” Your landing page 
needs to meet those expectations
Landing Pages Lead to New Customers
When someone clicks your ad, they are taken to your website. Usually this is the first 
brand interaction someone has with your company. It’s your first chance to showcase 
your offer to that searcher.
Landing page is industry jargon for the first page a searcher views after clicking 
on your ad. It should rarely be the home page of your site. It should be a page within 
your website that is most logically connected to the search query.
For instance, if someone conducted a search for Sony digital cameras, that per-
son would not want to be taken to Amazon.com’s home page. The home page does not 
have information about Sony digital cameras. At best, the searcher will search again at 
Amazon’s site. At worst, they will go back to the search results. A much better search 
experience would have the searcher taken to a page about Sony digital cameras within 
Amazon’s website.

■  T h e Psychology of Se a rch

Remember, most searchers do not know your website. The searcher does not 
have prior knowledge about your company. They arrived at your site after clicking a 
very short ad, and that small amount of text is all the information they have about 
your site before first visiting it. Therefore, that ad copy is crucial in setting the proper 
expectation for what the searcher will find after clicking your ad.
To continue meeting the searcher’s expectations, your landing page must logi-
cally follow from your ad copy. Since your ad copy informed the searcher about what 
they would find, the landing page should continue the conversation by assisting them to 
find their answer (see Figure 1.4).
Figure 1.4  This JustCloud landing page showcases a service and allows a searcher to either create an account or get more 
information.
If your landing page does not meet the searcher’s expectation, they will use the 
most common navigational element on the entire Web—the dreaded Back button. You 
paid for the click; this is something you definitely want to avoid.
The landing page should show someone the answer to their question or instruc-
tions on how to get the answer to their question. For an e-commerce site, the answer is 

Chapter 1:  U n dersta n di ng Se a rch T h eory  ■
14
contained in the product someone will receive once they’ve checked out through your 
shopping cart. When they’re looking for a plumber, the answer comes after they make 
a phone call. At other sites, the answer will come after the searcher fills out a form for 
more information. For most businesses, when the consumer receives the answer to their 
question, the business has a new customer.
The landing page is critical to your AdWords success. A bad landing page leads 
to wasted advertising dollars due to the searcher leaving your site without conducting 
any business with your company. A good landing page will turn shoppers into buyers.
The process of someone searching and buying on the Web is much different 
from other forms of advertising. While many other types of advertising campaigns are 
structured to create emotional need within a consumer, the search advertising process 
is driven by giving someone the correct information at the correct time. This concept 
extends from choosing the correct keyword to creating your ad copy and ultimately 
answering the searcher’s question on your website.
Advertising Is Not Advertising When It Is Information
Once upon a time I was riding on the top of a First Avenue bus, when I heard a mythi-
cal housewife say to another, “Molly, my dear, I would have bought that new brand 
of toilet soap if only they hadn’t set the body copy in ten point Garamond.” Don’t you 
believe it. What really decides consumers to buy or not to buy is the content of your 
advertising, not its form.
David Ogilvy
Often people are resistant to advertising. Ads are something you are bombarded 
with on a daily basis. You hear ads on the radio when you are driving to work. You see 
ads on TV when you are trying to relax in the evening. You see ads in the daily paper 
as you are trying to read the local weather forecast. You see ads in search results as you 
are trying to find information.
But ads do not have to be annoying or intrusive. Ads can be very helpful if 
they are created properly, because advertising is not actually advertising when it is 
information.
By aligning your ad copywriting, landing pages, and Google AdWords account 
with this concept, you are much more likely to see success in your search marketing 
efforts. This is a concept much better visualized than explained.
Imagine this weekend will be nice and sunny and you would like to spend it with 
your family at the beach. The drive will take several hours, but you manage to pack the 
kids and the spouse into the car and begin your journey.
You start driving down the interstate while the kids are glued to a DVD player 
in the backseat. Billboards whiz past on the side of the road, which you do not have to 
try to ignore; you have had the skill to tune out advertising for many years.

Ads Should Lead Searchers to Answers
If you performed the search LED TV features, do you think clicking this ad would help you find the 
information you are looking for?
“LED TV. Massive new TV offerings. Visit us today to buy your new TV!”
Unfortunately, ads that are not directly related to the search query and that do not mirror the search 
process are quite common.
Now consider this ad for the same search of LED TV features:
“Compare LED TV features. Find a new LED TV that fits your lifestyle and budget.”
Someone searching for features is most likely looking to compare products and is not ready to buy yet. 
They are still in the comparison shopping stage of the buying cycle. An ad focused on buying does not 
fit into their decision-making process.
Ad copy needs to both reflect the search query and recognize where a searcher is within the buying 
cycle; we will examine both of these elements in future chapters.
After a few hours, you start to get hungry and the kids start to get restless. It is 
time to find a restaurant for lunch. You have made the decision that you do not want to 
eat in the car as it is too messy with the kids, and you would like to get out of the car 
to stretch your legs.
Where do you start looking? Those ignored billboards. They are no longer 
advertisements cluttering up the roadside; they are now valuable pieces of information 
that will show you available lunch options.
You stop ignoring them and start reading them.
Why?
Because the advertisements are your source of information for finding the 
answer to your question. Your question is along the lines of “What are my lunch 
options?” Your answer will be found in the billboards alongside the interstate.
When ads become part of the information-gathering process, they cease to be 
ads. At this point in time, they are pieces of information that consumers are seeking. 
Wouldn’t you like your ads to be sought after, not ignored? By aligning yourself with 
the search process, the quest for answers, not only will your ads help consumers find 
the answer to their questions, but they will also help your business make sales.
Stop thinking of ads as advertisements.
Start thinking of ads as pieces of information.
Goal Alignment: Google vs. You vs. the Searcher
Every search result has three different entities trying to reach their goals. Sometimes, 
these goals get in each other’s way, leading to poor search results. Other times, they 

Chapter 1:  U n dersta n di ng Se a rch T h eory  ■
16
work in conjunction, leading everyone toward success. It is important to examine 
Google’s goal, the advertiser’s goal, and the searcher’s goal for each search result.
All search results start with the same element, a searcher looking for the answer 
to a question. The searcher inputs a query, and SERPs appear.
Google’s goal is to have that same searcher use Google for their next query. The 
more search queries that occur on Google properties, the more chances Google has to 
make money by people clicking ads. Therefore, Google wants searchers to always find 
the answer to their question quickly, easily, and on a Google-owned property.
This is why Google also spends so much time and money on the natural results 
(also known as organic or free listings). Not all searches can be monetized, but if some-
one always finds their answer on Google, regardless of whether a particular search 
query is monetized or non-monetized, that person is more likely to use Google for their 
next search. In addition, if someone finds their information on Google more quickly 
and easily than on other properties, they will always return to Google to find infor-
mation, which leads to more total queries per month for Google, which leads to more 
chances of Google making money.
Note:  Several studies in 2005–2008 found that users spent only 10–12 seconds on a search results page. 
Studies performed in 2010 and 2011 found that that users were spending 12–17 seconds on search results. More 
studies are showing that the time spent with search results is still continuing to slowly increase. As more informa-
tion is integrated into search pages, users are spending more time absorbing that information.
The advertiser’s goal is to show an ad that is related to both their products and 
the searcher’s query. The advertiser wants to control when their ad is shown, wants to 
choose which ad is shown, and then wants to take the searcher to the landing page of 
the advertiser’s choice.
The advertiser wants to make money with their Google AdWords budget. That’s 
the endgame—profitable advertising. Advertisers want control over how their money 
is being spent. They also want insight into the ad display process so they can expand 
their profitable advertising and stop their unprofitable ads.
Google’s goal and the advertiser’s goal are not the same. Since Google’s goal 
is first and foremost to satisfy the searcher, not the advertiser, a conflict often arises 
between the two parties.
The advertiser will scream that it’s their money and they should be able to dis-
play whatever they want in an ad and take someone to any page on their site they deem 
desirable. AdWords customer service reps will remind the advertiser about relevancy 
and attempt to help the advertiser make their keywords and ad copy more relevant. 
These relevancy rules are defined by Google.
Since AdWords is ruled internally by a search results quality control team—a 
team where relevancy trumps dollars—advertisers often feel like they are constantly 

■  Be st Pr ac t ice s for A pply i ng Se a rch T h eory
17
trying to play catch-up in learning all the rules. Having an internal team that is more 
concerned about relevance than making money is beneficial to all parties, if everyone 
can align their goals. 
It is critical to remember that the only person who makes Google or the adver-
tiser any money is the actual searcher. Google does not make you money. You do 
not make Google money. Google is an intermediary between you and the searcher. 
You make money on AdWords because a searcher decided to do business with your 
company. You define a budget that you are willing to give to Google; however, if the 
searcher does not click your ads, you do not owe Google a penny.
Both you and Google make money from each other only if a searcher is involved. 
If there is no searcher, there is no search query, your ad is not displayed, and Google is 
not paid. Therefore, the person to actually align your goals with is the searcher. If you 
align yourself with the searcher, you help the searcher find information on your site. If 
they are finding information on your site, they are conducting business with your com-
pany, which helps you reach your end goal—a profitable business.
Note:  Google took in $14 billion in revenues in the first quarter of 2013, which was a 31 percent increase 
over the same quarter in 2012. More than half of their revenues were from countries other than the United States. 
Approximately 93 percent of Google’s revenue comes from showing ads.
Because Google’s goal is to assist the searcher in finding information, you will 
end up aligning yourself with Google as well. You will find that if you think of the 
searcher first, AdWords is much easier and much more likely to be a successful adver-
tising medium for your business.
After all, the searcher’s only goal is to find the answer to their question.
Best Practices for Applying Search Theory
The basics of search are not difficult to understand; the principles have been the same 
ever since people started looking for information. By referring to the fundamentals of 
search throughout your marketing, you keep your efforts aligned with the searcher, 
which can bring long-term success to your company.
••
PPC marketing was created and revolutionized in less than a decade. Because the 
industry is ever-changing, those who can continuously evolve their marketing 
can find great success.
••
Search engines have transformed how people find their information. As more 
consumers use search engines as their starting point for finding information, 
more advertisers will find success with search marketing.
••
The search process starts with a question. That question is translated into words 
by the searcher. Therefore, keywords are individual thought processes.

Chapter 1:  U n dersta n di ng Se a rch T h eory  ■
18
••
Every time someone does an action, there is an expectation of results. Meeting 
these expectations with both ad copy and landing pages helps increase your PPC 
marketing returns.
••
Advertising is not advertising when it is information. When your ads help a 
searcher find the answer to their question, your CTR and conversion rates often 
increase.
••
On any search page there are three goals: the search engine’s goal, the searcher’s 
goal, and the advertiser’s goal. Align your goal with your potential customer—
the searcher—and success usually follows.
In future chapters, we will examine keyword research, ad copy writing, and 
multiple ways to target consumers. At each step, we are trying to enhance these funda-
mentals. If you can help the searcher find what they are looking for, you will continue 
to gain new customers.

Performing Keyword 
Research
Keywords are the foundation of a successful 
AdWords campaign. If you have a keyword that 
matches a searcher’s query, your ad could show. 
Keywords are so paramount to an 
AdWords campaign that PPC advertising is fre-
quently called “keyword advertising” or “key-
word-driven” advertising.
Not all keywords are created equal. Some 
keywords will have high search volume, whereas 
others will have small search volume. Some will 
have high conversion rates, and others will pro-
vide low-quality traffic.
Choosing the correct keywords is the first 
step to advertising with Google AdWords.

Understanding the Buying Funnel
Before diving into all the various ways to research, group, and choose keywords, let’s 
take a step back and examine how people buy products or services.
There are five stages to the buying funnel (Figure 2.1):
••
Awareness
••
Interest
••
Learn
••
Shop
••
Buy
Awareness
Interest
Learn
Shop
Buy
Figure 2.1  The buying funnel
Understanding where a keyword falls in the buying cycle can help signal where 
a consumer is within the buying process. That way, you can ensure that your ad and 
landing page match the consumer’s shopping phase.
Although the buying funnel often refers to actual physical product sales, 
the same principles apply to business-to-business (B2B), service, retail, and other 
industries.
Note:  The buying funnel is a subset of the broader known buying cycle. The entire buying cycle has two 
additional phases known as retention and advocacy. While customer loyalty and lifetime visitor values are impor-
tant considerations for your entire marketing program, they can be distracting when we initially discuss keywords. 
Hence, we will work only with the initial aspect of the buying cycle, the sales funnel, during our exploration of 
keywords and revisit the full buying cycle in later chapters.

■  U n dersta n di ng t h e Bu y i ng F u n n el
21
The shopping cycle is illustrated as a funnel because many searchers will enter 
the beginning of your product’s buying funnel. However, as consumers learn more 
information about your product as compared to others, fewer consumers will transi-
tion from one section to the next. One of your jobs as a marketer is to move as many 
prospects as possible through the funnel so they become customers.
Examining the Buying Funnel Phases
Awareness starts the funnel. If consumers do not know about your products, they can 
never buy from you. A marketer’s first job is to make sure consumers know that your 
products exist. If consumers are unaware of your product, they will not realize your 
product can fix their problem, let alone understand that you offer a way to help them. 
At this stage of the buying funnel, your job is to shout from the rooftops that your 
product exists.
When you correlate this part of the buying funnel to keywords, the keywords 
are very general. Consumers do not yet know enough to do a search for the product’s 
benefits, features, or part types. These keywords are often high-volume, low-converting 
words such as TV, plumber, laptop memory, and real estate.
Once a consumer knows that your product exists, your next function is to gen-
erate interest for your product or service. At this stage, you want consumers to think 
about your product and how it will make their lives better. We will discuss features 
and benefits more in Chapter 4, “Writing Compelling Ads,” when we explore ad copy 
writing. At this stage of the buying funnel, you want to focus on benefits. Essentially, a 
benefit is what your product will do for consumers so they desire your product.
After consumers have become aware of and interested in your products, they 
need to learn more about those products so they have enough information to make 
informed purchasing decisions. This is known as the learning or information-gathering 
phase of the buying funnel.
This stage is where consumers start to delve into product specifications and fea-
tures and begin to compare products. If a searcher were looking to buy a new HDTV, 
this is where they would start to examine the features and differences associated with 
plasma vs. LCD vs. LED televisions. Consumers want to know about pixel burnout rates, 
what the magic mirrors are in LEDs, and what size TV they need for optimal viewing.
If you were an accounting firm, this is where you would showcase that you offer 
payroll services, are integrated with Intuit QuickBooks, and have a lawyer on staff for 
incorporation services.
It is in the learning stage where searchers first learn your industry jargon. The 
searcher’s query is often more specific and commonly includes brand names and service 
specialties. Showcasing both benefits and features is useful for consumers during this 
phase.

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
22
Using these examples, you could easily put keywords such as Chicago 
QuickBooks accounting firm, Samsung LED TV, and plasma TV pixel burnout rate 
into your keyword list.
Once consumers understand enough about the industry or product that they can 
start looking at product specifications to make informed decisions, they will begin to 
compare similar products to each other. This is known as the shopping phase.
At this phase, a consumer might have decided they would like a plasma TV 
because it’s light enough to hang on the wall and, based on how far their couch is from 
the wall, they want a 52-inch set. However, the consumer might not know if a Sony TV 
has certain features that a Samsung TV does not have. Therefore, while the consumer 
has decided on a 52-inch plasma TV, the brand and actual model are still in question. 
Or the consumer might have determined that they want a Sony, but there are multiple 
types of Sony plasma TVs, and therefore the consumer needs to compare the various 
model types.
Keywords at this phase are often quite specific and indicate a certain level of 
knowledge about the product. Sony Vaio Z series laptop, Sony plasma 52-inch TV, 
and Chicago accounting services with lawyer on staff are keyword searches that 
describe consumers in this aspect of the buying funnel.
Finally, a consumer has made up their mind on the actual product they are will-
ing to purchase. At this point, the only question left to answer is where to buy the 
plasma TV or which accounting service can offer both a lawyer on staff and quick 
phone support.
These keywords are often product part numbers or company names: Jim’s 
accounting service or Samsung UN55D6000 55 1080P LED TV. A consumer will 
examine prices, warranties, shipping costs, service contracts, return policies, and simi-
lar items before finally making a decision on where to buy the specific product.
How Do Consumers Flow Through Your Buying Funnel?
The buying funnel is different for every business. It is important to examine your com-
pany to determine how people find their information, make their decisions, and finally 
engage companies within your industry.
There is no time limit to the buying funnel. A used book sale might consist of 
five minutes from initial query to buying. A B2B $100,000 software integration pack-
age may take six months or more.
Some consumers will jump directly into the learn phase or buy phase of the buy-
ing funnel. If you are shopping for a new book and you already know an author you 
like because of a previous book you have read, you do not need to learn more about the 
author—you just want to see what other books that author has written and maybe take 
a quick look at customer reviews. If you are tasked with finding both a software pack-
age and an integration vendor to move your company’s email to a lower total cost of 

■  U n dersta n di ng K ey wor ds
23
ownership system, the search may take many twists and turns through many months 
of discussions and searches.
Note:  Jargon can be useful both as keywords and in ad copy. However, always keep in mind whether some-
one knows enough about your product to use jargon or understand the jargon you are using. If searchers are early in 
the buying funnel, jargon terms may confuse them because they are still learning about your product. Later in the 
buying funnel, jargon can be useful as keywords. When someone uses a jargon keyword, you know that they know 
something about your products or services.
Always keep in mind that every single keyword you choose for your AdWords 
campaign will fall into at least one phase of the buying funnel. Some keywords may be 
somewhat ambiguous as to which exact phase of the buying funnel they fall into. In 
those cases, you may wish to test different landing pages for these keywords to see if 
the informational page or a product page has a higher return for your company.
It can be a useful exercise to examine your keywords and see in what aspect of 
the buying funnel you are reaching prospects. If all your keywords fall into the aware-
ness and learn phases but you do not have any in the buy phase, you might help a con-
sumer decide which product to buy but then not capitalize on their search when they 
are finally buying.
Conversely, if all your keywords fall into the buy phase, you might be generating 
very few sales. By using keywords further up in the buying funnel, you can generate 
more awareness and sales for your company.
Of course, having the keyword in your account just means your ad might show 
for the search result. Both your ad and your landing page need to continue engaging 
the consumer so that you receive both the click and the conversion associated with that 
keyword. The first step is making sure you have the proper visibility.
Understanding Keywords
Keywords are thoughts put into words. You search to find the answer to a question. 
Always remember that when you choose a keyword, you are telling a consumer that 
you can help them find the answer to their question.
When doing keyword research, you should always keep the searcher in mind. It’s 
their thoughts put into words that you want as keywords so your ad can be shown on a 
search results page.
Before we delve into the four main types of keywords, let’s take a closer look at 
the scenario from Chapter 1, “Understanding Search Theory,” to see how any scenario 
can utilize these types of words.
Our searcher is sitting in his Chicago suburban house in January watching 
TV on a Saturday afternoon. Suddenly, his spouse calls up from the basement that 
there is water everywhere. Upon investigation, our searcher determines that a pipe 

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
24
froze, causing the pipe to break and flood their basement. This happens every year in 
Chicago. What are the possible keywords?
First, keywords or thoughts are often segmented into four key areas:
••
Explicit
••
Problems
••
Symptoms
••
Product names or part numbers
We will examine each individually.
Types of Commercial Keywords
Explicit keywords are the easiest to research. These keywords often have the highest 
search volume of all the keyword types. They directly describe the product or ser-
vice, and very little creativity is necessary to research these keywords. Here are some 
examples:
••
Dermatologist
••
Computer memory
••
Plasma TV
In our example, if we were to list keywords for a plumber, we might have the 
following:
••
Plumber
••
North Chicago plumber
••
Chicago plumbing services
••
Emergency plumber
••
Plumber phone number
••
Saturday plumbing
Problem-based words are the second type of keywords. These keywords 
describe the conditions or problems that your product solves. These are also known as 
curing searches. Here are some examples:
••
Acne
••
How do I get rid of acne
••
Can’t run Excel
••
Toothache
••
What toothpaste will help cure a toothache?
If you examine your products and services and think of what you solve for a 
consumer, or how you make their life better, these are often problem-based keywords. 
In our plumber example, a flooded basement search would describe the root problem.

■  U n dersta n di ng K ey wor ds
25
Symptoms make up the third type of keyword search. These keywords describe 
the symptoms of the actual problem. Here are some examples:
••
Oily skin
••
Slow computer
In our earlier example, symptom searches may include the following:
••
Frozen pipes
••
Burst pipe
••
Broken pipes
The fourth type of keyword is product names or part numbers. These are com-
mon keywords late in the buying funnel. Here are some examples:
••
P-10113/4 (a pipe number, which might be used in the flooded basement 
example)
••
Mint Soufflé Cleanser
••
512 MD DDR2-533 SODIMM (computer memory)
If we look closely at the keyword examples, we can devise our own story from 
them. We need a dermatologist because we have acne, which is caused by oily skin, 
but we could use the Mint Soufflé Cleanser to help care for our skin. Our slow Sony 
Vaio is causing large Excel files to fail to load because we don’t have enough computer 
memory. After researching the problem, our choice for the best computer memory is 
two 512 MB DDR2-533 SODIMMs.
By not just looking at keywords but also by examining the scenarios that cause 
someone to need your product, you can quickly expand your keyword research into 
new, untapped areas.
There are other keyword search intents that might be more applicable for your 
industry. The next most common keyword search is an informational query. These are 
often harder keywords to monetize for those selling products or services—but with a 
bit of creative thought to both answering the question and engaging the searcher, you 
can find new keyword search volume.
Here are examples of informational queries:

These keyword searches may not have any commercial intent. However, they are 
excellent top-of-the-funnel keywords to create more awareness for your business and to 
engage a searcher to start them down the buying funnel.

Finding Keyword Ideas
When conducting keyword research, first consider your themes instead of actual key-
words. A theme is a collection of closely related keywords. In AdWords accounts, they 
are also known as ad groups. By first concentrating on your themes, you will build a 
high-level list of how your products or services coordinate with the keyword types.
Often the navigation on a website is already broken down into themes, and 
much of your initial work is already conducted. However, these are only the direct key-
words, and you will still need to do research on the other types of keywords for those 
direct keywords.
If your website does not have a good navigational structure then, as we walk 
through the following keyword research ideas, instead of thinking in individual key-
words, first take a look at the high-level themes. Once those are established, come back 
to each theme and fill in the keywords.
For example, if you were a plumber, here’s a list of some of the more popular 
themes:
••
Plumber
••
Broken pipes
••
Fix shower
••
Kitchen remodeling
••
Bathroom remodeling
••
Overflowing toilet
••
Emergency plumbing
••
Weekend plumbing
••
Flooded basement
And the list goes on. You should be able to come up with more than 50 different 
themes for a plumber. With some work, you might even come up with a few hundred 
themes. Although you know your business well, your potential customers—the search-
ers—do not; your business is quite complex when you start researching every problem 
you can fix.
The Two-Word Rule
If you are having problems grouping your keywords, use the two-word rule. This is a simple rule 
where you pick two root words that will signify the theme of the ad group. Then, every keyword in 
that same ad group should have those same two words in them but may have additional modifiers 
before or after the root words.

Starting Your Keyword Research
Begin by analyzing your website: your website’s navigation and the words used on your 
site. We will showcase the AdWords keyword research tool in Chapter 3, “Keyword 
Tools: Extracting Valuable Data from Google,” which will help you take a deep look 
into your own website.
If you have offline marketing material, examine your print collateral. Often 
direct mail pieces are carefully optimized over years of time. Are there hot-button 
words in your materials?
Analyze your top competitors’ sites. Do they have navigational elements that are 
different from yours? Why? Is it that they offer different services than you or that they 
have broken down their site differently? If their site is just broken down in different 
ways, make note of those themes and see how their organization might jumpstart new 
ways for you to consider additional themes.
Examine the natural search results. Search engines try to diversify their results 
by including both authority and hub sites. The authority sites are worth taking a closer 
look into because they are displayed on page one of the search results for some of your 
major keywords. Wikipedia.org and About.com are common authority sites.
Hub sites are places where consumers can find a variety of information and links 
to other similar sites. Follow what the search engines consider hubs to see what other 
keywords and navigational elements these sites use. Since a hub site is trying to link to 
the most relevant sites for a category, they often have refined navigation that can help 
you organize themes. Do not forget to take a look at whom they link to, because a good 
hub will showcase a large variety of information. DMOZ.org and DexKnows.com are 
good examples of hub sites.
Ideally, you have a web analytics system in place. If not, Google offers a free 
system to get you started called Google Analytics. Your web analytics system will show 
you what keywords someone searched on various search engines to find your website. 
If you have goals or conversion tracking configured, you can even see which keywords 
led to higher conversion rates.
One of the best places to mine for new keywords and themes is your internal 
search engine. If your site has internal search, you should be tracking what keywords 
visitors are searching for within your site. This information will tell you exactly what 
someone was trying to find. It is also a good place to examine your landing page’s 
effectiveness. If you have a page with a high search percentage, essentially the searcher 
did not find what they wanted on your landing page and had to do another search to 
find their information.
Note:  Google has a product called Custom Search Engine, which is a free search engine for your site if you 
show ads within the results. There is also a premium version without ads. This product is easy to integrate into both 
your site and your Google Analytics system so you can track what users are searching for on your website.

My favorite tool will be the subject of Chapter 3: the AdWords Keyword Planner.
When doing research for both your keywords and themes, there are two points 
to remember. First, always keep the searcher in mind. The searcher is who you are try-
ing to reach. You are advertising on a keyword you think they will type into a search 
engine and click on a result afterward. The searcher is the one who will ultimately 
make you profitable.
Second, always keep your products in mind. Your products or services are the 
lifeblood of your company. It’s by selling those items that you can satisfy a searcher. 
When choosing keywords, make sure they are an accurate reflection of your products 
and services.
Do You Know Your Keywords?
Who searches for the word bleach?
If you thought the most common searcher was a 20- to 50-year-old female, then 
you have joined a large group of people who do not watch Japanese anime. The most 
common searcher for the word bleach is a male under 24 years of age. The explana-
tion? A few years ago a new Japanese anime program called Bleach launched. The 
show has completely changed the dynamic of that word.
There are words whose meanings have changed, and there are other words that 
describe multiple items. A search for the word ceramic could be for a $0.99 figurine or 
a $10,000 factory part.
A search for buy pipe could mean a nice meerschaum tobacco-smoking pipe or a 
replacement for the busted pipe in your basement.
Sometimes relatively few people searching on a particular keyword will fit your 
ideal customer profile, and you may want to avoid using that keyword altogether. For 
instance, if you sold Clorox and realized that the majority of people searching for the 
word bleach do not meet your website goals, you may want to not advertise on that 
specific keyword. There are other times when the word is essential to your advertising 
campaign.
There are ways to write ad copy so you can showcase whether you are selling 
Clorox bleach or Bleach DVDs. This will help the searcher understand what products you 
offer. However, the first step is that you have to know it’s a commonly confused word.
The best way to start understanding your words is to look at the natural search 
results. If you see sites or ads for seemingly unrelated industries, investigate further.
Another place to find these differences is in your keyword reporting, which we 
will discuss in later chapters. If you see words that seem highly targeted yet do not 
convert, it is worth your time to take a quick look and see if those words have multiple 
meanings.

Two good research tools that gave nice insight into demographics by search 
query were Yahoo! Clues (Figure 2.2) and Microsoft AdLabs. Unfortunately, these 
tools have been retired and no tool on the market replicates their functionality. Ideally, 
another one will be built to easily give marketers quick insights into demographic 
searches besides just looking at the search results.
Figure 2.2  Yahoo! Clues demographic prediction
Understanding when your keywords might be confused with other products or 
services can help you be more specific with the words and themes you choose, to keep 
you from spending money on keywords that do not lead to sales.
How Many Keywords Should You Have in Your Account?
You have probably heard someone mention an AdWords account that has more than a 
million keywords. Yet, by most estimates the English language contains roughly only 
one-quarter of a million words. How can an AdWords account have more than four 
times the number of words that exist in the entire English language?
The answer is simple: by creating keyword lists.
Before creating keyword lists and generating millions of keywords, consider 
what you are going to do with those keywords. Most companies do not need millions 
of keywords. There is no magic number for how many keywords you should have in 
your account. The answer to “How many keywords should I have in my account?” 
comes back to relevancy.

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
30
You should have only relevant keywords in your account. If the keywords you 
create help a searcher find the answer to their question, then these are good keywords. 
If your keywords start to become ambiguous and could have multiple meanings, you 
need to make a financial decision about whether it is worth it to your company to 
advertise on a word with marginal (or worse, negative) results.
For example, if you were to search for TV, what would you expect to find?
••
TV reviews
••
TV guide
••
TV repair
••
TV celebrities
••
Plasma TVs
These highly unrelated terms could all be shown for a keyword such as TV. The 
keyword is not specific enough to have any definitive user intent. Here are some issues 
to consider:
Examining Your Keywords  If you cannot determine the user intent of a keyword, it is proba-
bly not specific enough for your account. This is a general guideline, and there are defi-
nitely exceptions. It is useful to first test the more specific keywords, and then once you 
have an idea of cost per conversion and conversion rates on the more specific keywords, 
try some of the more general keywords to see if they are profitable for your advertising 
dollars.
Determining the Right Number of Keywords  The next consideration in determining how many 
keywords you should use comes back to management time. If you have 100,000 key-
words, you will need to find a scalable way to manage that many. Microsoft Excel files 
and database reports are highly time-consuming for organizing that much data and 
determining your profit on each keyword so that you can decide how much you would 
like to bid for each word. You may need a bid management system to handle that many 
words.
Understanding Google AdWords Account Limits  The last consideration is Google AdWords 
account limits. If it has been a while since you examined your potential account limits, 
you need to look again. In 2012, Google raised the number of campaigns to 10,000. 
The number of keywords was raised from 50,000 to 5 million. With these new limits, 
most companies will never run into hard caps on how many keywords, ad groups, or 
campaigns can exist within their AdWords account.
If you do need more than 5 million keywords, or if you need to organize accounts by 
business units, Google can link accounts together on the back end so they share some 
data and serve only one ad per search result. If you need multiple accounts, talk to an 
AdWords representative.

■  U n dersta n di ng K ey wor ds
31
Note:  Google has designed their editorial system to maximize choice and transparency for their searchers. 
Because they want to maximize searcher choice, they have design rules around ensuring that advertisers do not try 
to trick the system by running multiple ads and accounts for the same business because that would remove user 
choice. Therefore, each Google account should be a single business. If a single business needs multiple accounts, all 
of your accounts should be linked together. A single business running multiple unlinked accounts can run into terms 
of service (TOS) issues with Google’s editorial teams. The MCC (My Client Center) account, which can help manage 
multiple accounts at once, will be discussed in Chapter 14, “Successful Account Organization Strategies.”
If you are wondering why Google has caps on the number of keywords in an 
account at all, you can examine it from their perspective. Every keyword entered into 
their system has to be stored in multiple databases. Every local database is examined 
for keyword matches every time someone conducts a search on Google. Google is try-
ing to filter through millions of keywords to serve ads to a searcher in less than one 
second. The less total database space being used to house keywords, the easier it is to 
sort through the keywords to quickly serve results to the searcher.
Therefore, although you will learn techniques for creating millions of keywords, 
it is best to initially keep your list to far fewer words than Google allows, unless you 
have a system in place to manage that many keywords.
Creating Keyword Lists
Most words in the English language can be categorized as a noun, adverb, adjective, 
preposition, pronoun, or verb. The same can be said for products. Most products can 
be described by product types, product attributes, adjectives, and so on. By breaking 
down your products or services into their base elements and then recombining these 
words, you can easily create huge keyword lists.
For example, Table 2.1 is a chart for maternity clothing that is by no means 
exhaustive but can be used to illustrate this point.

In the table, if we always used a word from both the Category Adjectives and 
Product Types columns and then mixed and matched the rest of the words, the words 
in Table 2.1 would become 504 keywords.
If you were to make five lists of five root words and mix and match them all, 
that would create 6,026 keywords. As you can see, keyword listing is powerful but can 
easily grow out of control. Therefore, it is important to keep your account structure 
in mind when creating keyword lists. You should first diagram your final ad groups 
before creating the lists. If you create keyword lists first, you have to try to categorize 
them all into ad groups.
In Table 2.1, the minimum number of ad groups should be six, one for each 
product type. You could easily have a few hundred ad groups from this information.
For example, at the most granular level, each keyword generated could instead 
be an ad group. To fill in the keywords within the ad group, you could use plurals, mis-
spellings, and similar words such as t-shirt, tshirt, and tee shirt.
Creating word lists to generate thousands of keywords is useful. However, if 
done improperly, you could quickly end up with more keywords than you know how 
to organize, let alone manage. You can use the exact same techniques of creating lists 
to first diagram your ad groups, and then you can create lists within each ad group to 
generate the final keywords used within your account.
Keyword Mixer Tools
You do not have to do all this mixing and matching yourself. There are tools that will do the hard com-
bination work for you. The following graphic shows one of the most popular, the keyword mixer tool 
from Certified Knowledge.

By first creating your ad groups and then filling in your keywords, it is much eas-
ier to organize your account and keep your keyword lists from spiraling out of control.
Using Long-Tail Keywords
The long tail is a term popularized by Chris Anderson in an article in Wired magazine 
(October 2004) to describe how niche markets can sell a large number of infrequently 
sold items that together create more total sales than the top-selling product lists.
For example, before the days of the Internet, bookstores had to keep physical 
inventory in their stores. There is a finite number of books that can be housed and 
displayed on shelves within a store. The top-selling books in each category were most 
prominently featured. A book had to constantly sell to continue to maintain space on 
the shelves; otherwise, it was relegated to the discount bin to make space for a book 
that was selling. Although some of these books might have sold a few copies each 
month, it was not worth the shelf space to try to keep them in stock.
Then came Amazon.com, which had no physical storage limit for its products. 
Suddenly, a book that sold only one copy a month, or only a hundred copies a year, 
could still be profitable for Amazon. When you combine the millions of books that  
sell only a few copies, those total sales can be equal to or even exceed the top best-
selling books.
You can repeat the same logic for any niche-based business, such as Netflix. 
Netflix carries thousands of copies of the most rented titles. However, the power of 
Netflix comes from their ability to carry even a few copies of each low-demand title. 
It is a powerful value proposition to the Netflix customer that even these niche movies 
can be rented. The total rentals for the low-demand movies in aggregate numbers may 
be equal to the total rentals of the top hundred movies.
This same logic can be applied to keywords. Single-word keyword searches 
make up roughly 34 percent of the search volume in the United States. However, the 
most frequently searched words are navigational queries such as Facebook, Google, 
Amazon, Craigslist, and eBay.
If you remove these common navigational queries, single-word queries make up 
approximately 20 percent of all queries. Conversely, once those single-word naviga-
tional queries are removed, search queries that are five or more words in length make 
up roughly 20 percent of the search volume as well.
There are two main ways that marketers use the phrase “long-tail keyword” 
when discussing keywords:
••
The first refers to keyword searches that are three or more words in length. 
Essentially, someone typing in three or more words in a search box is being spe-
cific in defining the information they are wishing to discover.
••
The second refers to keywords with low search volume. Instead of focusing on 
how many words are in the search query, these marketers consider long-tail 

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
34
keywords to have low search volume. In this instance, even a one-word keyword 
with low search volume would be a long-tail word.
Change in One-Word Queries
For many years the number of single-keyword queries declined, and the number of five-plus keyword 
queries increased. This trend saw a reversal around 2011 when one-word queries began to increase in 
volume. This is because of a change in navigational behavior by younger demographics.
Older demographics grew up with website navigation and therefore often go directly to a website 
and then navigate from within the website to what they are looking to find. The younger generation 
has grown up with search, and therefore, even when they just want to log in to Facebook, they often 
search for Facebook or Facebook login on a search engine and then click within the search result to 
navigate to the website. This has skewed the query volume back to single-word queries. When you 
remove pure navigational search queries, long-tail queries are still increasing in both total volume and 
the percentages of search volume.
There are several advantages to using long-tail keywords and incorporating 
them into your keyword lists:
••
There is often less competition on these search queries. It takes more keyword 
research and keyword creation discipline to have an encompassing keyword list. 
By expanding your keyword reach to these less-frequently-used search queries, 
you can often find gems that cost very little.
••
The much more important reason is that many long-tail search queries are more 
specific, and it is easier to match the user intent with both the proper ad copy 
and the proper landing page.
Regarding the second reason, if someone searches for long sleeve silk maternity 
shirts and one ad copy talks about generic maternity shirts and another one talks about 
silk maternity shirts that have long sleeves, which do you think a consumer is more 
likely to click on?
Keyword advertising is about choosing keywords and ad copy that can answer a 
user’s initial question. The closer you can associate the ad copy to the user intent, the 
higher the click-through rate. If you pair that ad copy with a landing page that also 
includes that same product or service, conversion rates are usually higher as well.
Utilizing the long tail for both ad group organization and keyword research will 
let you associate your marketing more closely with the user intent, which has benefits 
for both the searcher and the advertiser. The searcher finds the answer to their ques-
tion, and the advertiser receives more conversions on their website.

Wide vs. Deep Keywords
When either using keyword lists or using the long-tail approach, you must consider 
wide versus deep keywords. They are very different, and the wrong approach can send 
you spiraling down a path of tens of thousands of closely related keywords that do not 
accurately encompass the best keywords for your account.
Instead of just creating long keyword lists, consider the various ways people look 
for information about your product and services. Earlier in this chapter, we discussed 
explicit, problem, and symptom keywords. Each of those types of keywords represents 
different ways of finding the exact same product. You first need to aggregate the differ-
ent keywords used before drilling down into the specific keywords.
For example, if you were advertising a spyware-removal product, it would be 
easy to expand this list to create thousands of keywords from the simple root word 
list in Table 2.2. However, what you would end up with is a list of keywords that all 
include the root keyword spyware. That does not represent all the ways people search 
for spyware removal.

The list in Table 2.2 would be considered a deep keyword list. It only encom-
passes the way people search when they are using the root keyword spyware. Before 
you start to go deep, you will first want to go wide with your keyword list.
A wider, more encompassing keyword list would be built from a root word list 
that looks like Table 2.3.

Instead of relying on the root word spyware to be included throughout your key-
word list and in the search query, this keyword list examines the different root words 
used in searching for spyware removal. If your product converted much higher for 
adware keywords, and you started with all spyware keywords, you would be missing 
your most profitable keywords.
This also makes it easier to concentrate on the correct keywords. Start with a 
very wide list. First, you should think of all the ways that someone can search for your 
product or services. From those thinking patterns, create a root word list. These are the 
major words used to describe your offerings.
Run these keywords (with their appropriate modifiers) for a while in your 
AdWords account. Once you start to see which wide keywords are receiving more 
clicks and conversions, you can focus on going deep within those root keywords.
In addition to just expanding your keyword list from these root words, these 
types of tests can also help you determine what aspect of the long-tail keyword belongs 
in your ad. If you have keywords that contain brands, product types, attributes, col-
ors, and sizes, odds are that you cannot include all of this data easily into your ads. 
Therefore, by first determining what aspects of the keyword are most important to the 
user, you can make sure you are using those words in your ads.
By taking this two-step approach to both keyword and ad group creation, you 
will be spending your time more wisely building profitable keyword lists. It is easy to 
create massive amounts of keywords, but it makes more business sense to create profit-
able—and manageable—keyword lists.
Discerning Keyword Match Types
AdWords gives an advertiser a significant amount of control in determining when an 
ad will be shown. We will continue to discuss many of these additional options in later 
chapters. However, keep in mind that if you do not match your keywords appropri-
ately, these additional controls will only have marginal increases in producing high-
quality traffic.
There are four match types that AdWords uses to determine whether your ad 
should be displayed based on the user’s search query: broad, modified broad, phrase, 
and exact match. These are also referred to as positive match types because they define 
when your keywords will be allowed to match against a user search query to display 
your ad.
There is a fifth match type, negative match, which does the opposite. It prevents 
your ads from being shown when your negative keyword is present in the user query.
We’ll start with the four positive match types.

■  Discer n i ng K ey wor d M atch T y pe s
37
Broad Match
A word is considered broad matched when you enter a keyword into an ad group with 
no formatting around the word (Figure 2.3).
Figure 2.3  Broad match keywords in an ad group
Broad match keywords can trigger your ad to show if the searcher uses a query 
that is related to your keywords. Broad match keywords match to misspellings, plurals, 
and even similar words.
For example, if you had the broad match keyword coffee cups, you could match 
to coffee cup (singular), cofee cup (misspelling), or coffee mug (similar word).
In addition, the order of the words does not matter. To continue our example, if 
you used the broad match coffee cups, you could match to cups coffee or mug coffee.
You can be matched if the search query contains similar words to your keyword 
with additional parameters. For example, if your keyword was coffee cups, you could 
match to coffee red mug, blue mugs coffee, or coffee cup holder.
Lastly, when you use broad match, your keywords can be matched within a 
search session to a completely different query. For instance, if someone searches for 
coffee cups, looks at the results, and then searches for a coffee maker, your coffee cups 
keyword could be triggered to show an ad because the user has not ended that search 
session.
If you sell only coffee mugs, being matched to a keyword such as coffee cup 
holder is probably not a good match. In these cases, we will show you how to keep 
your ad from showing when we visit negative keywords later in the section “Using 
Negative Match.”
The biggest problem with broad match is that you are matched to “similar” 
items and you don’t get to define similar—Google does. This leads to a lot of queries 
triggering your broad match keywords that are not relevant to your business. In addi-
tion, the higher your CTR, the broader the search queries that could trigger your ads.

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
38
For instance, if you had a good CTR on the term coffee mugs in broad match, 
you might show for the search query tea cups. If you did happen to also sell tea cups, 
you should have a different ad copy and landing page for that keyword than for the 
keyword coffee mug. So while you will often match to these additional queries, some-
times these clicks will not turn into sales because of the irrelevant ads and landing 
pages.
However, there is an advantage to broad match: not having to find all the pos-
sible variations of keywords. In a November 2008 article, Google announced:
Did you know that 20% of the queries Google receives each day are ones we haven’t 
seen in at least 90 days, if at all?
http://adwords.blogspot.com/2008/11/ 
reach-more-customers-with-broad-match.html
Google restated this number privately in 2011 and in 2013, but it even went fur-
ther: 20 percent of queries Google receives each day are ones they had not seen in the 
last six months, if at all. As more search queries occur, the number of possible keyword 
combinations is also growing.
When one-fifth of all searches on Google have not been seen by Google in the 
last six months, and that engine receives billions of queries each month, it is easy to see 
that it is impossible to have every single keyword related to your products or services 
within your account.
The problem of marketers wanting to use broad match to reach all of the pos-
sible queries and yet maintain some control finally manifested itself in a new match 
type: modified broad match.
Modified Broad Match
If you examine your keyword phrases, usually there are one to three words that really 
matter in the phrase, and the other words are modifiers that do not mean as much to 
your conversion rates. For instance, if you take the query Size 9 red Nike shoes, you 
would want to make sure the words Nike and shoes are in the query, but the size or the 
color might not matter. With modified broad match you can signal to Google that only 
the words Nike and shoes are important and the search query should be closely related 
to those two words, but the rest of the words in your keyword phrase can be treated 
with more liberal matching.
To tell Google what words are important, you just put a plus (+) sign in front of 
the most important ones. The words with the plus sign can still match to plurals, mis-
spellings, and very similar words, but they should not match to completely different 
types of words. With modified broad match, the ordering of the words does not matter, 
just as with broad match. Let’s look at a few examples of modified broad match with a 
different main search query, wedding cakes (see Table 2.4).

In each instance, a word very related to the keywords with the plus sign was 
in the search query—but plural, singular, or misspelled versions of the word did not 
matter.
Inside Google’s interface, you will still see modified broad match words listed as 
broad match. There is no modified broad match type in the interface. The fact that you 
have added a plus sign to the word makes it modified broad match (Figure 2.4).
Figure 2.4  Modified broad match keywords in an ad group
If you want to maintain some control but do not want to have research every 
variation of possible words, modified broad match is an excellent place to start when 
you add keywords to your account.

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
40
Please note, you do not have to add every single modified broad match combina-
tion in your ad groups. I have seen accounts where the keyword lists look like this:
••
+red wedding cake
••
red +wedding cake
••
red wedding +cake
••
red +wedding +cake
••
+red +wedding +cake
••
+red wedding +cake
In this case, you need to determine if red matters to you. If it does not, then you 
can use the keyword variation red +wedding +cake. If the word red does matter, than 
you can use the variation +red +wedding +cake.
When Should You Use Broad Match?
Because modified broad match gives you so much control, there are only a few reasons 
to use the standard broad match type.
One of the best uses of broad match is to buy research. With broad match, you 
can match to many queries, and search queries will give you excellent insight into 
search behavior. So, if you think of broad match as buying search data and not as key-
words that you need to prove ROI, broad match can be very useful.
Another reason to try broad match is when there are very few queries for the 
account. If you are trying to serve ads into a very small geography or are in a very niche 
business, you might try using some broad match to increase your total impressions and 
clicks; just make sure they are helping you reach your overall marketing goals.
Phrase Match
A keyword is considered “phrase matched” when you enter the word in an ad group 
within quotation marks, as seen in Figure 2.5.
Figure 2.5  Phrase match keywords in an ad group

■  Discer n i ng K ey wor d M atch T y pe s
41
In order for your phrase match keyword to display your ad, the search query 
must contain your keyword in the same order you typed it into your ad group.
For example, if your keyword was coffee cups, your keyword would match to 
phrases such as the following:
••
Coffee cups
••
Blue coffee cups
••
Coffee cups blue
••
Red coffee cups for traveling
In each of these instances, there could be words before, after, or before and after 
your keyword. It could also be the keyword phrase itself. However, your keyword was 
always included in the search query.
Phrase match keywords do match to misspellings or plurals unless you disable 
this function, which will be addressed in the “Variation Match” section. Therefore, if 
you have the keyword coffee cups, the following searches would trigger your ad:
••
Coffee cup (singular)
••
Cofee cups (misspelling)
••
Cups coffee (different word order)
Your ad would not trigger if someone entered a word in the middle of your 
keyword, between the words coffee and cup. In the coffee cups example, if someone 
searched for coffee blue cups, your ad would not show because the search query did 
not contain your phrase exactly.
Just to clarify, the user is not typing in quotes or adding formatting when enter-
ing their query into Google. The user is searching as usual; the quotes are only used 
to signal to Google that you would like your keyword to be triggered if it matches the 
search pattern. For example, in Figure 2.6, if you had the phrase match keyword coffee 
cup, your ad could be displayed.
Figure 2.6  Google search query that will display an ad for coffee cup phrase  
match keyword
Phrase match used to be one of the best match types to use for new accounts 
since it gave you a lot of control. However, with the introduction of modified broad 
match, many advertisers have been using phrase match much less. If you are using an 
automated bid system where the number of keywords under management does not 
necessarily mean it takes you more hours to manage your account, you should use 
phrase match.

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
42
However, if you are managing accounts by hand, then using a mix of modified 
broad and exact match is a good way to start, and then you can apply phrase match 
for those special instances where modified broad match doesn’t give you the ad serv-
ing control you’d prefer. For example, if you are selling Pittsburgh Steelers (an NFL 
football team) gear and you add the keyword +Pittsburgh +Steelers Jerseys in your 
account, you might show for search queries such as the history of steel mining in 
Pittsburgh. Usually, NFL fans type in the name of their team in the same phrase over 
and over but with different modifiers on the gear. In this instance, using Pittsburgh 
Steelers Jerseys in phrase match could be a better option than modified broad match.
Exact Match
Exact match is the most specific matching option that AdWords offers. First, you must 
enter the keywords into your ad group within brackets, as shown in Figure 2.7.
Figure 2.7  Exact match keywords in an ad group
Exact match works just how it sounds: A user must type into the search box a 
query that is identical to a keyword in your ad group for your ad to be displayed.
Exact match keywords can match to misspellings, similar keywords, plurals, or 
singular forms of the words.
If you have the exact match keyword [coffee cups], your ad would be shown if 
someone types in coffee cup (singular), or cofee cups (misspelling). However, if the user 
typed in blue coffee cups (additional word), or coffee mugs (similar word), then your 
exact match keyword will not trigger an ad to be displayed. The biggest advantage 
of exact match is that you know exactly what someone is typing into the search box. 
You can examine your ad copy, landing page, and keyword to ensure that a perfectly 
formed synergistic chain has been established that will maximize your conversion rate.
In longer queries, exact match will also show user intent. A keyword such as buy 
plasma TV shows commercial intent. A keyword search such as LCD vs. plasma TV 
or advantages of accountants over tax prep software signals a comparison-shopping 

■  Discer n i ng K ey wor d M atch T y pe s
43
intent. In this case, users need more information before they are ready to buy a prod-
uct. A search such as congressional term lengths has an informational intent.
While we all use a search engine to find answers to questions, our intent upon 
finding those answers can vary quite significantly. The main intents online are commer-
cial, informational, and navigational. However, just because you have a shopping site 
does not mean you should not use informational terms in your keyword list. It means 
you need to make sure you are engaging those users first with information and then 
have that information lead them to your products.
Variation Match
While exact and phrase matches can show for plurals and misspellings, there is a way 
to disable this behavior in your account so that you know exactly what will trigger 
your ad. There is an option inside AdWords that can cause these two match types to 
not show for misspellings and plural versions known as near match or variation match 
(Figure 2.8).
Figure 2.8  Exact and phrase match options
This is a campaign-level setting, so it will apply only to the keywords in that 
particular campaign. To understand whether this setting is good for you to employ, 
you need to take a look at your data to see whether you have drastic changes in your 
conversion rates, cost per conversion, or average sale amount by keyword variation.
For instance, there is a wholesaler of restaurant clogs that finds that when a 
user searches for restaurant clogs their average order value is $562. If a user searches 
for restaurant clog (singular) their average order value is $97. Since their average order 
value is so different by singular and plural terms, they would not want to use this set-
ting because they are willing to bid much higher for the plural version of the keyword 
than the singular version.
Conversely, there is an electronics retailer that finds their conversion rate, aver-
age order value, and cost per acquisition is the same for the terms Plasma TV (singu-
lar), Plasa TV (misspelling), and Plasma TVs (plural) and therefore this setting is useful 
for them to employ.
When you first open an account, you will not have the data to determine if this 
is a good or bad setting, so let your budget decide for you. If you cannot reach your 
daily budgets, then leave this feature on so that you will receive more impressions 
and gather the data to decide. If you do not have the budget to buy all the possible 

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
44
impressions, then it can be good to turn this option off until you have the budget to 
experiment with showing for more word variations.
Which Match Type Is Best?
Now that you know the four positive match types, how should you use them within 
your AdWords account?
First, you should know you can use all four positive match types for the same 
keyword within the same AdWords account or campaign. You could have the same 
keyword exact, phrase, modified broad, and broad match within the same ad group.
Second, when determining which match types to use, there are two major con-
siderations: budget and reach.
If you are starting with a small budget and only want to increase your budget as 
you find profitable keywords, you will want to start with mostly exact match keywords 
and maybe some modified broad match. Once you find keywords that are meeting your 
business goals, then you can add the phrase match or modified broad match versions of 
those keywords.
If you are starting with a large budget and are willing to throw everything at the 
wall to see what converts, you will want to start with mostly modified broad match or 
broad match keywords. If you have a large budget but want some control, then start 
with mostly modified broad match. If you want lots of data to work with and are will-
ing to pay for some clicks that will be irrelevant, then use broad match. As you find 
keywords that convert, add those words as exact and phrase match words over time.
You can also start with all four match types if you want. This is useful for add-
ing the branded terms in mostly exact and phrase match, and then adding the two- to 
three-word keywords as modified broad and phrase match, and adding the four-word 
and longer keywords in modified and some broad match versions.
If you have multiple match types, make sure that you have exact match bid 
the highest, phrase match a little lower, modified broad even lower, and finally broad 
match at the lowest bid.
The reason why you want to set bids will become apparent in Chapter 7, 
“Demystifying Quality Score.” Essentially, if all four keywords can be triggered in a 
single search result, Google will show the one with the highest ad rank. Ad rank is a 
number derived from multiplying your Quality Score by your maximum CPC (cost per 
click). By bidding the most on exact match, you are forcing a higher ad rank for the 
exact match than the phrase or broad match keyword.
Another reason you would want to bid exact match the highest is that you know 
exactly the keywords used in the search query. It is much easier to determine user 
intent with exact match words than with the other match types. With phrase or broad 
match, the search query should be related to your keywords, but it may not be your 
actual keywords.

■  Discer n i ng K ey wor d M atch T y pe s
45
You should find that exact match has the highest conversion rate, then phrase 
match, then broad match. If you find that broad match has a higher conversion rate 
than phrase or exact match, it is generally because you are being matched to some 
search queries where you do not have that corresponding keyword in your account, 
and those queries have higher conversion rates than your account’s keywords—which 
then causes the broad match keywords to appear to have higher conversion rates. You 
can use the search query report (detailed in Chapter 16, “AdWords Reports: Extracting 
Actionable Information”) to see some of the actual search queries that were used by 
searchers to trigger your keywords to show ads.
Lastly, if you make sure that your exact match is bid higher than your phrase 
match, and that your phrase match is bid higher than your broad match, every time 
your phrase or broad match keyword is shown, it’s highly likely that you do not have 
that exact match keyword in your account. Because of the number of unique queries 
seen on Google within a day, you will never have every exact match keyword in your 
account. It is just not possible to find every single variation. This brings us to the sec-
ond point to consider when using multiple match types: reach.
Broad, modified broad, and phrase match will help you reach a larger user base. 
If you only have exact match keywords, you are considerably lowering the possible 
search queries that your keywords could be matched to and thus will not reach nearly 
as many users.
By examining both your budget and desired reach, you can determine how many 
different match types you wish to use when creating a new ad group (Figure 2.9).
Figure 2.9  Ad group using all four match types
Once an ad group starts to collect statistics, you can use the search terms report 
to determine what keywords you wish to add to your ad group and what keywords you 
do not wish to trigger your ad.
As a starting point guideline, bid phrase match 15 percent less than your 
exact match bid, and bid modified broad match another 15–25 percent less than your 

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
46
phrase match bid. If you want to buy some research or more impressions through the 
use of broad match, bid that another 15–25 percent lower than modified broad match.
Using Negative Match
Negative match keywords are filtering words. Negative keywords prevent your ad from 
being displayed on a search result. If you have phrase and broad match keywords in 
your account and some of the variations do not have good conversion rates, using nega-
tive match keywords can stop your ads from showing on those search results.
Before implementing negative keywords, you should have a way to measure 
your conversion rates and cost per conversion. In Chapter 15, “Implementing Testing 
Techniques That Will Increase Profits,” we will discuss a free conversion tool that 
Google offers to measure your results.
The reason you need conversion tracking implemented into your account is that 
when you add negative keywords to your account, some specific things should happen:
••
Your conversion rate should increase. Because you are now only showing your 
ad for queries relevant to your product or services and are not being matched to 
more obscure words that are not directly reflective of your offerings, you should 
see your conversion rate go up.
••
Your cost per conversion should decrease. Since negative keywords keep your ad 
from displaying on less-relevant results, when you do receive clicks, those clicks 
should be of higher quality and lower your overall cost per conversion.
••
Finally, tracking is not needed for this, but another benefit of negative keywords 
is that your click-through rate should increase. Since you are now ­choosing to 
stop your ad from showing on irrelevant search queries, the times your ad is 
shown should be more relevant and thus gain a higher click-through rate.
If you do not see these three items happening, you need to revisit your negative 
keyword list to see if you added negative keywords that stopped your ads from show-
ing on keyword searches that were driving sales. It is common for someone to know 
about negative keywords and automatically add the word free. However, a search for 
plasma TVs with free shipping would not trigger your ad if you used the negative key-
word -free. If you happened to sell plasma TVs and offer free shipping, that is a won-
derful query for you to show your ad. Therefore, you need to be careful when adding 
negative keywords.
Implementing Negative Keywords
There are a few places within your account where you can add negative keywords.  
The first is within an ad group. Navigate to an ad group, and when you enter a  
keyword, add the minus (-) sign in front of any words that you do not wish to trigger 
your ad.

■  Usi ng N egat i v e M atch

Negative Keyword Formatting
Depending on where you add negative keywords to your account, you may or may not have to add the 
negative (-) sign in front of a word to signify it’s a negative keyword. For instance, if you add a nega-
tive keyword in an open text box to signify new keywords, you need to add the negative sign. If you 
add the negative keywords in the negative keyword interface, you do not need to add the negative 
sign. For purposes of easy illustration of negative keywords within text, and not overwhelming you 
with an overabundance of screenshots just to show or not show a minus sign, we will put the negative 
sign in the text so that it is obvious as we progress through this book if we mean negative or positive 
keywords. The screenshots will reflect the interface, so they may not have negatives in front of them.
For example, if you were using the broad match keyword coffee cups, and you 
wanted to make sure you would never show for tea cups, you would add the negative 
keyword -tea to your ad group, as shown in Figure 2.10.
Figure 2.10  Negative keyword -tea in an ad group
You can also navigate to the bottom of the Keywords tab and enter negative key-
words directly into the Negative Keywords area. When you add negatives here, you do 
not need to include the minus sign in front of the keywords as you enter them.
When you add a negative keyword within an ad group, it only affects the key-
words in that group. Therefore, in this example, you could have one ad group selling 
coffee mugs with the negative keyword -tea and another ad group selling tea cups with 
the negative keyword -coffee. In this instance, you could now use some broad match 
words and ensure that the correct ad was displayed.
Please note that in this example, if you only had the just described two ad 
groups, a search for tea and coffee mug set would not display any ads. This is because 
both tea and coffee are within the query, and each ad group has a negative keyword 

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
48
that would keep your ad from showing on that query. Therefore, it can be useful to cre-
ate comparison ad groups that don’t use either of those negative keywords. In this case, 
you’d create an ad group containing tea and coffee sets without either of those negative 
keywords, so your ads would be eligible to show. The second place you can use nega-
tive keywords is at the campaign level. At the bottom of the keyword screen, next to 
the ad group negative keywords are also campaign-level negative keywords.
In instances where you are adding campaign negative keywords, these negative 
keywords will affect every ad group within that specific campaign.
If you never want to show ads for particular keywords, it is best to add the nega-
tive keywords at the campaign level. It is not uncommon for an account manager to 
add a negative keyword to one ad group in their campaign, only to find that search 
queries start triggering ads shown from a different ad group in that same campaign. 
They then add the negative to that ad group, only to find the search queries are now 
triggering ads from yet another ad group.
Ad group–level negative keywords are best for ensuring the correct ad group 
shows when there are two or more possible keyword matches within the same 
campaign.
For instance, if you are a hosting provider, you may have ad groups that contain 
related keywords such as hosting, website hosting, VPS hosting, and cheap hosting. If a 
user were to search for cheap VPS website hosting, every single ad group could show for 
that query since it contains words that are most likely used in each of the ad groups.
In cases like this, ad group–level negative keywords (Figure 2.11) are best to 
ensure that the correct ad is being displayed.
Figure 2.11  Shaping ad groups with negative keywords

■  Usi ng N egat i v e M atch
49
Note:  Google does not currently offer an account-wide negative keyword option. However, there is a Shared 
Library option that lets you manage lists of negative keywords and apply those lists to a campaign or multiple 
campaigns. Whenever you change the negative keywords in a list, your change will automatically be reflected for 
each campaign where the list has been applied. This is the best way to manage negative keywords when you want 
multiple campaigns to have the same negative keywords.
The easiest way to see if you have multiple ad groups showing for the same 
query (Figure 2.12) and therefore need to employ ad group–level negative keywords 
is with a pivot table (a spreadsheet program feature) and the search terms report (dis-
cussed at length in Chapter 16).
Figure 2.12  Pivot table showing how many ad groups are displayed for a query
If you have search queries, such as baby toys shown in Figure 2.12, that are 
showing from multiple ad groups, then you have lost ad serving control. In this case, 
you want to employ negative keywords so that you know exactly what ad group, key-
word, ad, and landing page will be used when someone searches for that term.
As with positive keywords, there are also match types for negative keywords. 
These three match types are called broad, phrase, and exact negative keyword match. 
However, while the names are the same as those for positive keywords, the rules for 
how the match types work are different for negatives.
Negative Broad Match
When you navigate to your ad group and just type in a minus (-) sign and a keyword, 
you’ve created a negative broad match. Negative broad keywords stop your ad from 

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
50
showing if that word is anywhere within the search query. Negative broad keywords do 
not match to misspellings or plurals.
For example, if you had the negative keyword cups (-cups), a search for cof-
fee cups or tea cups would not display your ad, because the search query contains the 
word cups. However, a search for coffee cup (singular) or coffee cps (misspelled) would 
display your ad since the word cups was not explicitly stated within the search query.
You can also use multiple words in a negative broad keyword. In this instance, 
the order of the words does not matter, as long as all of the negative words are in the 
query. Once again, these do not match to plurals or misspellings, and there is no option 
to change this setting as there is with positive keywords.
If you added the negative keyword coffee cups (-coffee cups) in your ad group, 
your ad would be displayed on a query such as blue coffee cup (singular) or cofee cups 
(misspelled). However, your ad would not be displayed for the following:
••
Coffee cups
••
Blue coffee cups
••
Coffee blue cups
••
Cups coffee blue
••
Cups of coffee
This occurs because every example contains both the word coffee and the word 
cups.
Negative Phrase Match
Negative phrase match keywords must be contained within the user query in the exact 
order you entered them. Additional words can be contained before or after the search 
query; however, if the search query contains your negative phrase in the same order, 
your ad will not be displayed.
As with broad match negative keywords and regular phrase match keywords, 
this match type does not match to singular or misspellings.
For example, if you had the negative phrase match -“coffee cups” your ad would 
not be shown for queries such as:
••
Coffee cups
••
Blue coffee cups
••
Coffee cups and mugs
This is because every one of those examples contains the keyword coffee cups in 
the same order.

■  Usi ng N egat i v e M atch
51
However, if you have the negative phrase match word -“coffee cups” your ad 
would be displayed for queries such as:
••
Cups coffee (different order)
••
Coffee cup (singular)
••
Blue coffee cup (singular)
••
Coffe cups (misspelling)
••
Coffe cups and tea (misspelling)
When adding negative phrase match words, the formatting is straightforward. 
Add a minus sign and then the keyword in quotes: -“negative phrase match”. If you are 
adding these negative keywords to the negative keyword text box, you do not need the 
negative sign (Figure 2.13).
Figure 2.13  Negative phrase match keywords used in an ad group
You can use negative phrase match words at either the ad group or campaign 
level.
Negative Exact Match
In the negative exact match, your ad is not displayed when the search query matches 
your negative keyword exactly.
For instance, if you had the negative exact match keyword -[coffee cups], your 
ad would only not be displayed if someone typed coffee cups into the search box.
If the search query was coffee cup (singular), cup coffee (different order), or 
coffe cup (misspelling), the negative exact match keyword would not stop your ad from 
displaying (see Table 2.5).
As with the regular exact match, the negative exact match does not match to 
plurals and misspellings.
The formatting is also the same as the exact match keyword, except you add a 
negative sign in front of the formatting brackets. The formatting is -[keyword].

Putting Negative and Positive Keywords Together
When using negative and positive keywords together, you should first determine when 
you want your ad to show and whether there are specific variations when you do not 
want your ad to be displayed. Once you have determined those conditions, it becomes 
easy to choose the proper negative and positive keywords and respective match types.
For example, let’s create a fictional company that sells Disney videos. After run-
ning their ads for a while, they realize that when a searcher just types in Disney video 
their conversion rates are low and they are not profitable on those keywords. However, 
upon further investigation, the company realizes that if the searcher types in anything 
with the keyword Disney video, they convert quite well. Therefore, they would not 
want their ad to show on the actual search Disney video, but they do want it to show 
for variations such as Little Mermaid Disney video, Disney video for sale, and newest 
Disney video.
This can be accomplished quite easily. The company would have an ad group 
with the negative exact match keyword [Disney video] and the positive keyword 
Disney video, as shown in Figure 2.14.

■  Usi ng N egat i v e M atch
53
Figure 2.14  Disney video negative exact match used with positive keywords
In this instance, the ad would be displayed only if someone searched for Disney 
video and any accompanying word. If someone just searched for Disney video, the ad 
would not be triggered.
Often, you will want to use broad or phrase match words to capture a wide vari-
ety of search queries. However, this often results in your ad displaying on queries that 
do not accurately reflect your company’s products. Using negative keywords to filter 
your ad from showing on these queries can allow you to maintain control over when 
your ad is shown and maximize your ad’s reach.
Researching Negative Keywords
It is just as important to keep your ad from showing on irrelevant queries as to show 
your ad on the correct queries. That also means it’s just as important to conduct nega-
tive keyword research as it is to research positive keywords.
The easiest place to find negative keywords is the search terms report. If you 
navigate to the reporting section of your AdWords account, one of the reports is called 
a “search term report.” Run this report, and you will have an Excel file that looks like 
Figure 2.15.
Figure 2.15  Search terms report in Excel

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
54
If your business is selling coffee mugs and you must have a cost per conversion 
of less than $5 to be profitable, you can see that the actual search query that contains 
RV is not profitable.
Note:  If you connect Google Analytics to your AdWords account, you can see a report in Google Analytics 
called the Matched Search Query report. This report will show the search queries along with metrics such as bounce 
rates (one-page visits) and time on site. You can use this information to find queries that may not have many clicks 
yet but are leading to such low interaction rates on your site that you need to either make them negative keywords 
or add them to your account in a different ad group with a new ad and landing page. The easiest way to find these 
queries is by building a filter inside analytics.
Assuming that you had enough data to prove this was a trend, or you did not 
sell RV coffee mugs, you would want to stop your ad from showing when RV was used 
in the search query. By adding the negative keyword -RV to that particular ad group, 
you can stop your ad from showing when the word RV is used in the search query.
If you happen to sell RV coffee mugs and do not want to lose that traffic, you 
could create a new ad group with keywords and ad copy that specifically speaks to 

■  Usi ng A dva nced Orga n i zat iona l T ech n iqu e s
55
those searchers looking for RV coffee mugs. The search terms report will give you a 
significant amount of insight into which actual queries are triggering your ads.
The other way of finding negative keywords is during your regular keyword 
research phase. In the next chapter, you will learn about Google’s powerful keyword 
research tool. As you use the tool, if you see words that are unrelated to your busi-
ness or words where you just do not want your ad to be displayed, make note of those 
potential negative keywords so you can add them to your account.
Using Advanced Organizational Techniques
When you have two or more keywords that can be triggered in your AdWords account 
from a search query, Google tries to show the most restrictive option. The constraints 
go beyond just match type to include geography, time of day, and so forth.
However, Google does not always show exact match over phrase match and 
phrase match over broad match. They also look at ad rank (max CPC × Quality Score), 
which we will cover in depth in Chapter 7. If you have an exact match term bid at $0.25 
and the broad match bid at $1, Google will generally show the broad match term.
As an advertiser, you will likely find that your exact match converts higher than 
your phrase or broad match. You should control the ad serving so you know which ad 
copy and keyword will be displayed for any search query. You can control the ad serv-
ing through the use of bids or negative keywords.
There are several ways you can organize your match types within your paid 
search account. None of the strategies are better or worse than each other—they are 
just different. For each of these scenarios, we will assume you are using multiple match 
types for the same keyword and look at the pros and cons of each method.
Adding Multiple Match Types to the Same Ad Group
With this method, you add a keyword to an ad group multiple times, each with a dif-
ferent match type.
The pros of this method are that you have fewer total ad groups to create and 
optimize. This saves on both creation and management time. If you have a limited 
amount of time (and/or technology), this is by far the easiest method to use.
There are several cons to this method. With exact match, you can make a good 
guess as to the user intent of the word, so your ad can be specific to the keyword. With 
broad match, you know a lot less about the user intent, so you might write a more gen-
eral ad copy that incorporates the keyword. This method does not allow you to write 
ads by match types.
The only way to control ad serving with this method is to make sure your exact 
match is the highest bid, your phrase match the second-highest bid, and then modified 
broad match. If your ad rank for your broad match trumps your exact match, your 
conversion rates and other data by match types become compromised.

Chapter 2:  Per for m i ng K ey wor d R e se a rch  ■
56
While there are some negatives to this method, this is the method that is gener-
ally recommended for new advertisers because it is much simpler to create and manage 
than some of the other options available.
Restricting Match Types by Ad Group
With this method, each ad group will contain only one match type. If you want to 
advertise on both exact match and phrase match terms, you will have two different 
ad groups. In addition, for each of your ad groups you will use negative keywords to 
ensure the correct match type is being triggered. For instance, your phrase match ad 
group will contain exact match negatives of all the keywords.
There are a few advantages of this method. The first is that the proper keyword 
match type should be displayed in a search result. You do not have to ensure that your 
phrase match ad rank is higher than your exact match ad rank (however, it should 
be since the conversion rates for exact match should be higher than those for phrase 
match). This method also allows you to write ad copy by match type.
The biggest con is that your account can quickly be overwhelmed with too many 
ad groups to the point that you have to create new campaigns for all your ad groups 
because there are hard limits on how many ad groups can be within a single campaign. 
This method takes a lot longer to set up and a little bit longer to manage than grouping 
all the match types in a single ad group.
It is common to see this method employed where the long-tail keywords are 
grouped by match type into a single ad group, and then the higher-priced keywords or 
higher-volume keywords are broken down by match type into different ad groups.
Restricting Match Types by Campaign
Brands that are successful with AdWords often have a campaign just for their branded 
terms. This campaign is often one of the higher-budget campaigns because it has the 
best conversion rates and lowest cost per acquisition (CPA), the amount you pay to 
acquire a customer or lead. A natural extension of that same logic is that exact match 
keywords have the second-highest conversion rates and second-lowest CPAs for most 
brands. However, there is a limit to how much you can spend on exact match each 
month based on search volume. Therefore, you can put all your exact match keywords 
in a campaign with a budget to capture all of that search volume.
The next-highest conversion rates come from phrase match words. Group all 
your phrase match words into another campaign. Finally, have yet another campaign 
for modified broad match and broad match keywords. This last broad match campaign 
will use the last of the company’s budget.
If the budget gets increased, the broad match campaign’s budget is often 
increased. If the budget is being reached, lower the budget from the broad match cam-
paign, which also has the lowest conversion rates of all the campaigns.

When you restrict match types by campaign, you also need to add negative key-
words by match type at the campaign negative level (just like the method restricting 
match types by ad group) to ensure the proper keywords are being displayed.
The biggest pro to this account structure is that you can adjust both bids and 
budget by match types. This method also allows you to write ad copy for each match 
type and keyword organization.
The issue with this account structure is that you can quickly have too many 
campaigns. If you have multiple campaigns by match type, and each ad group only 
contains keywords of the same match type (which cause you to also need more cam-
paigns), and you are doing geographic targeting or the content network, you can 
quickly become overwhelmed by too many campaigns.
Each campaign must also have a budget. If you slice your budget too thin, none 
of your campaigns will receive much traffic. In addition, this method takes more orga-
nizational and management time than the other structures. This method is not recom-
mended for smaller budgets.
Taking Control of Your Ad Display
Positive keywords are the lifeblood of Google AdWords. If you do not have a keyword 
that will match to a searcher’s query, your ad will not show. It’s quite simple. It is 
crucial that you not only conduct keyword research, but that when you use these key-
words in your account, you understand what search queries people can use that will 
trigger your ad to show on a search result.
Conversely, when you find search queries that you do not want your ad to show 
for, block your ad from showing by using negative keywords. Negative keywords 
should raise your CTR, lower your CPA, and increase your conversion rate.
As you add negative keywords, keep an eye on total conversions. Even if the 
negative keywords are doing their job, if your total conversions drop significantly, you 
may need to trim some of your negative keywords.
If keywords lead to conversions but at a higher cost per conversion than you are 
comfortable paying, you should lower the bids to a profitable level instead of just keep-
ing your ad from showing by using negative keywords. Remember:
••
Positive keywords trigger your ads.
••
Negative keywords stop your ad from showing.
By using these two keyword types together, you can take control of your 
account to ensure you receive the maximum exposure and profit from your AdWords 
campaigns.

Best Practices for Conducting Keyword Research
Keywords are the foundation of your AdWords account. If you do not have a keyword 
that matches to the search query, your ad will not be shown. Comprehensive keyword 
research is essential to maximizing your account’s exposure to potential customers.
••
Every keyword falls into a section of the buying funnel. Understanding where 
your keyword falls in the funnel is important to ensure you are reaching con-
sumers at different stages of their buying behavior.
••
Keywords can be broken down into four major aspects: explicit, symptoms, 
problems, and product names or part numbers. Utilize each type of keyword to 
reach the maximum number of searchers.
••
Start keyword research with your site, your competitors’ sites, the natural search 
results, internal site search, and the dictionary.
••
Make sure you know your own keywords. If your keywords describe one or 
more different products or ideas, use ad copy to tell the consumer which key-
word variation is related to your company.
••
A good way to start expanding your keywords is to create keyword lists. By cre-
ating lists for both ad group and keyword organization, you can create larger yet 
more focused lists.
••
When starting long-tail keyword research, do not use deep keywords. Deep 
keywords describe only a single aspect of how someone searches. Instead, start 
with wide keywords, and when you find keywords that are converting, do deep 
keyword research on those particular keywords.
••
There are four positive match types: broad, modified broad, phrase, and exact. 
Use a combination of these various match types based on your budget and mar-
keting objectives.
••
Negative keywords stop your ads from showing. It is just as important to con-
duct negative keyword research as it is to find new positive keywords.
••
The search terms report will show you what someone actually searched for that 
triggered your ad to show. Use this report to find new positive and negative 
keywords.
Keyword research can be time consuming, but it is necessary for maximum 
exposure. Many tools are available that will help you along in your keyword research 
efforts to help save you time and give you ideas you may have overlooked. In the next 
chapter, we will examine one of these tools: the AdWords Keyword Planner.

Keyword Tools: 
Extracting Valuable 
Data from Google
Understanding where keywords fall into the 
buying funnel is critical. Choosing your key-
words wisely and then measuring results will 
ensure the best chance of success for your cam-
paigns. By starting with wide keywords and 
then moving to deep keywords, you can ensure 
that you are directing your keyword research 
time into the proper areas.
After examining your site, competitors’ 
sites, search results, and internal site search, 
where do you go next to look for keywords?
A variety of tools are available online that 
will help you discover new keywords.

AdWords Keyword Planner 
Google has a tremendous amount of search data. Between its organic and paid search 
listings across its web properties such as news, Google.com, Google sites in various 
countries, images, and even products, Google has compiled a massive amount of data 
about search queries.
One of the most powerful tools you can use to start your keyword research pro-
cess is Google’s own AdWords Keyword Planner. This tool can examine the informa-
tion collected across all of these various properties.
You can access the AdWords Keyword Planner from within your account 
(Figure 3.1).
Figure 3.1  Accessing the AdWords  
Keyword Planner
There are two primary uses for this tool. The first is to research new keywords, 
and the second is to get detailed keyword traffic estimates. For both uses, Keyword 
Planner gives you options to change targeting methods and filter the data (Figure 3.2).
Figure 3.2  AdWords Keyword Planner main screen

■  A dWor ds K ey wor d Pl a n n er

In this first section, we will examine how to use the tool to research keywords; 
then we will examine the targeting options and filters, how to get more detailed key-
word estimates, and how to add your newly found keywords into your account. 
Generating Keyword Ideas
When using tools to generate ideas, keep in mind that they are just tools run by com-
puters. These tools do not know your business, they do not think, and they do not 
understand your customers. While a tremendous amount of data is available from these 
tools, you are the one responsible for choosing your keywords.
Ensure that the keywords you choose accurately describe your products or ser-
vices, the problems they solve, and the conditions someone may be in when they need 
your business. Remember, keywords are thought processes.
You should start by finding wide keywords—those keywords that describe the 
vast ways people search for words that are not closely related (for example, spyware, 
adware, virus, keylogger)—before diving deep into one specific keyword (for instance, 
spyware, spyware remover, spyware program).
We will first look at the three main ways of conducting keyword research and 
then examine the filters and then the data. When you choose the first option in the 
Keyword Planner tool, Search For New Keyword And Ad Group Ideas, you will be pre-
sented with three options on how to find keyword ideas (Figure 3.3).
Figure 3.3  Search For New Keywords And Ad Group Ideas screen
We will examine each of these methods in detail so you know how each method 
works and can generate accurate ideas for your account.
Word or Phrase
The first way to use the AdWords Keyword Planner is to input words or phrases from 
your products or services and ask Google to show you similar keywords and related 
keyword ideas.

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
62
Use this method when you are first starting your keyword research to identify 
the synonyms and ideas related to your major keywords. When you find different wide 
keywords, note them in a separate list from your keyword research. Doing so will help 
you keep tabs on the wide keywords and separate them from the thousands of key-
words you might normally add to your ad groups.
This tool ignores match types for keywords you enter here, so there’s no need to 
include match type syntax here. Later in this process, you can adjust the match types in 
the keyword details area.
You’ll find this tool especially valuable after you’ve had your campaigns for a 
while and you’ve accumulated a reasonable amount of data on your conversion rates 
and costs per conversion. If you see that a few sets of wide keywords are driving most 
of your sales or costs, you can dive into all the variations of those keywords.
Your Landing Page: Jumpstarting Your Keyword List
Since you already have a website and most likely you spent quality time writing your 
content, wouldn’t it be useful if you could just receive suggestions based on each of 
your website’s pages?
That is exactly what the landing page option accomplishes. You can enter a 
landing page URL in the landing page field, and the Keyword Planner will crawl that 
page attempting to decipher what keywords describe the content on that page and then 
suggest keywords based on what it finds. This is an excellent way to discover your wide 
keywords.
Understanding a Spider’s Role in the Web
When a search engine wants to index the Web, it uses a program called a spider or robot (often also 
called a webbot or just bot). The search engine sends out its spider to crawl the Web to find new pages 
to index so it can build a database from the information it discovers. The spider indexes content such 
as HTML, images, PDF files, or any other file found on the Web. The terms spider, spidering, crawl, and 
crawling are commonly used to describe the process of the spider discovering and indexing the con-
tent it finds.
The Keyword Planner will work on most HTML sites, but most Adobe Flash 
pages, some Ajax pages, and other unique coding methods not based on basic HTML 
code can have problems being crawled and understood by search engines. Google and 
others have made great strides in attempting to crawl sites designed in Adobe Flash 
and these other methods, but often these sites have a difficult time achieving relevancy 
in AdWords because Google’s crawlers cannot understand their pages. To find out 
whether AdWords has any problems understanding your website, enter your landing 

■  A dWor ds K ey wor d Pl a n n er 
63
page URL in this tool and examine the results. Just because the Keyword Planner 
brings back information about your page does not always mean it can be crawled well. 
In any case, it is good directional information if Google has some understanding of 
your website.
Note:  We will discuss quality score in Chapter 7, “Demystifying Quality Score.” In the meantime, keep in mind 
that entering your landing page in the AdWords Keyword Planner also helps you see whether Google thinks your 
page is about what you think it is about. If the two of you disagree, you may see much lower quality scores.
There is no restriction on what sites you can enter—you can attempt to crawl 
any page on the Web. If someone has amended their robots.txt file to not allow crawl-
ers to access the page, the tool will respect the robots.txt file.
Note:  A robots.txt file is an instruction manual for your website that tells a spider what pages it can crawl 
and index. It is found at yoursite.com/robots.txt. If you do not have a robots.txt file, a spider assumes it 
can index any page of your website. To learn more about robots.txt files, see www.robotstxt.org.
You can spider competitor pages, industry pages, search results, and so on to 
help build your wide keyword list. Here is a list of sites to spider when you are first 
starting your wide keyword research:
••
Your website
••
Your competitors’ websites
••
DMOZ.org category for your site
••
Thesaurus.reference.com
••
Dictionary.reference.com
••
MetaGlossary.com (one of my favorites)
••
Wikipedia.org
••
Google or Yahoo! news
••
The top authority magazine or journal for your industry
••
Sites where you receive your industry news
••
Any sites or blogs where you regularly receive your industry information
••
Any directory related to your industry
Note that you may want to do a search on some of these sites for your keyword 
first. For example, spidering the home page of Thesaurus.com is not useful, whereas 
spidering the search result page for your keywords at http://thesaurus.reference.com/
browse/YourKeyword will be more relevant to your company.

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
64
Every time you see a page on the Web that is highly related to your business, 
make note of the page so you can spider it when you do keyword research. This simple 
exercise will help you expand your keyword list over time.
The Keyword Planner can also help with your search engine optimization (SEO) 
efforts. With SEO, you do not get to pick keyword match types—you have to choose 
exact keywords. More advanced versions of SEO tools are available that examine traf-
fic more than individual keyword rankings, but you have to start somewhere. When 
using this tool for SEO research, make sure you only look at the exact match of a key-
word when trying to predict keyword volume.
Even beyond SEO and pay-per-click advertising, if you are looking for related 
keywords, or for thesaurus, competitor, trend, and other data, the Keyword Planner 
has uses within social media as well as competitor research. It is a powerful resource 
for conducting keyword research about your specific website and almost every other 
website on the entire Internet. Always keep this tool in mind when you are trying to 
find new wide keywords or when you come across an authority site related to your 
industry.
Keyword Suggestions by Category
The other way to use the Keyword Planner is by browsing through the categories. 
When you click the category section, a large drill-down of various categories and sub-
categories will appear that you can select (Figure 3.4).
Figure 3.4  Keyword drill-down by category
In addition, you can quickly search through the categories by inputting words 
that describe your products, and the tool will show categories that match your search. 
Most of the keyword suggestions will be wide keywords. In many cases, the key-
words will be so general you might not even want to use them in your AdWords account.
One of the best uses of the categories is to find other keyword themes you may 
have missed. This is good information for not only your AdWords keywords but also 

■  A dWor ds K ey wor d Pl a n n er 
65
your natural search rankings. You may see better ways to structure your site navigation 
based on some of the category information. In addition, this information can be useful 
for determining how to structure your ad groups.
Browsing categories is useful for finding ideas on keywords you might have 
missed or for gaining insight into Google’s association of keywords within a category. 
However, never build your AdWords account just using the category tool. There are 
too many poor suggestions and missing keywords per category to rely solely on this 
tool.
After you specify how you want to find keywords, the next step is to specify the 
type of data you want to see based on the advanced options and filters.
Advanced Options and Filters
Keyword Planner lets you specify targeting and filtering options to help you get the 
information you are most interested in. The filtering options narrow the data based on 
the targeting options you have set (Figure 3.5).
Figure 3.5  Advanced options and filters
These options are shown within the initial search or on the Keyword Planner 
interface screen. Your first targeting option is geography. You can do research on any 
of Google’s preset geographic options, such as countries, states, provinces, and metros 
(Figure 3.6).
If your company is global, it is useful to estimate to a single country at a time 
so that you can obtain a better estimate of search volume and costs per click (CPCs) 
for each country. It is common for CPCs to vary dramatically by country, and when 
possible, you should limit your campaigns to showing in a single country (location 
targeting will be discussed in Chapter 11, “Utilizing Advanced Geographic Targeting 
Techniques”). If your business serves only a single region, then you can narrow your 
keyword ideas and research to that specific region.

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
66
Figure 3.6  Location targeting options
Next, you can select the languages you want to include in your research. You 
can receive ideas for a single or multiple languages.
By default, Google gives estimates only for Google’s properties. If you want to 
receive estimates that include search partner data, edit the Google targeting option, 
select Google, and search partners.
Finally, if there are some negative keywords you know you want to exclude in 
keyword research so they don’t inflate or muddy your estimates, you can enter them 
individually or copy and paste them from a list. Once you’ve specified your target-
ing preferences, you can then customize your research by adding filters, starting with 
search volume, bid prices, impression share, and competition levels (Figure 3.7).
Figure 3.7  Keyword Planner filtering options for search volumes,  
bid, and competition levels

■  A dWor ds K ey wor d Pl a n n er 
67
If you are just starting out researching a new account, then you will most likely 
not filter any data. However, if you have been running an account for a while, then you 
will want to filter the data based on the new types of keywords you are trying to find.
The first filter is Average Monthly Searches. You can choose to show only those 
keywords with search volume above or below a number you select. If you are looking 
for wide words to get an idea of new possible areas to advertise, then seeing only key-
words with higher search volume is useful. If you have some wide words that have been 
useful for you and you want to expand into long-tail keywords from these wide words, 
then showing only lower keyword volume is useful.
The next filter is Suggested Bid. If you do not have a high budget, then you will 
usually want to filter out overly expensive keywords. The suggested bid is an estimate 
only; it is not necessarily what you will be using in your account. It can give you a 
good overall idea if a keyword is going to cost you $2 or $20, but it is not accurate 
enough to tell you if a word will cost you $1.20 or $1.25 per click because those CPCs 
are very close. 
When you use the Suggested Bid filter, it is suggested that you increase the filter 
to 30 to 50 percent higher than what you will bid for a keyword to give you a wider 
range of keyword ideas because in some cases your actual CPC will be lower than what 
is suggested (and in some cases it will be higher).
Ad Impression Share is the percentage of times that you have been shown for a 
keyword when one of your ads was eligible to be displayed. For instance, if a keyword 
could have received 1,000 impressions and your keyword was shown for 100 of those, 
then your impression share is 10 percent.
When you have a select set of keywords that are performing well and you 
want to add additional ideas around those words, this is a good filter to use. You can 
select impression share under 50 percent and then find ideas for which you have little 
exposure.
Please note that the impression share in the tool is based on query data and not 
keyword data. For instance, if you have the broad match word flowers in your account, 
you could show for the term exotic flowers even if that word is not in your account. 
When you examine the data, you will see the impression share for that query even 
though it is not an actual keyword in your account.
Finally, you can filter on competition. The Competition filter is just a wide range 
of estimates of how many advertisers are using this keyword. There is not always a 
correlation between CPCs and competition because you might have very little competi-
tion for a word, but the current competition is willing to pay a lot per click. In other 
instances, there may be many advertisers using a keyword, but the keyword is not 
worth that much per click, so all the bids are low. 
The second set of filters is based on keyword options (Figure 3.8).

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
68
Figure 3.8  Keyword Planner filtering options for keyword  
characteristics
There are four options here:
••
The first filter allows you to narrow the suggested keyword to only highly rel-
evant ones. If this is your first time researching data for an account, do not turn 
on this filter. It is good for narrowing suggestions in very niche areas or for find-
ing long-tail ideas, but if you are looking for a wide range of suggestions, you 
will want to leave this filter off. 
••
Adult keyword ideas are not displayed by default. If you are conducting research 
in adult areas, you will need to select the option to show adult ideas.
••
By default, Google does not show keywords that are currently in your account. 
If you want to see keywords that are already in your account, then turn this fil-
ter on. This is useful when you are using the Ad Impression Share filter to find 
keywords where you have low impression share so you can see the new keyword 
ideas versus your current keywords.
••
Finally, once you see data, you can add keywords to a plan. If you are continu-
ing to research ideas to add to your plan and you want keywords in your plan 
to continue to be suggested, then you need to turn on the final option, Show 
Keywords In My Plan. For the most part, there is rarely a reason to use this 
option.
The last option is to filter the actual words that are displayed based on the key-
word idea containing or not containing that specific term (Figure 3.9).
Figure 3.9  Keyword term filters

■  A dWor ds K ey wor d Pl a n n er 
69
If you are trying to find permutations of a single keyword, the include option is 
useful. If there are some words that commonly show up in your keyword list that are 
not related to your products and services, then the negative filter can save you from 
continuing to see those words in the suggested keyword ideas.
Once you have selected your criteria for finding keywords and are ready to see 
some suggestions, click the Get Ideas button and you will be presented with suggested 
ad groups and keywords ideas.
Ad Group and Keyword Ideas
Once you determine the search method and filters used to find keyword ideas, the next 
step is examining those ideas to see what keywords and ad groups you want to use in 
your account.
Please note that the Keyword Planner is very different from the old keyword 
tool. With the old keyword tool, you found keywords and then could estimate data 
within the tool and then add keywords to your account from that tool.
In the Keyword Planner tool, there are three steps to keyword research: choosing 
how to find ideas, picking your ideas, and then estimating traffic and for those ideas. 
In the second step, picking your ideas, you will examine the presented ideas and 
look at how to organize these ideas into ad groups before you review your estimates 
and add the keyword and ad groups to the account.
When you run the tool, you will be presented with a screen of data and options 
(Figure 3.10).
Figure 3.10  Ad Group Ideas screen

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
70
At the top of the screen, you can change the product or service you are getting 
ideas on. On the left side of the screen you can change your targeting and filter selec-
tions. The middle of the screen is where you will spend most of your time.
Keyword Planner Data
You can view data for either your ad group ideas or your keyword ideas in the middle 
section of the screen by clicking the associated tab. The type of data is very similar in 
these views. The main difference is that the ad group ideas view shows aggregated data 
from all the keywords in that ad group. The keyword ideas view shows the data for 
each individual keyword (Figure 3.11). 
Figure 3.11  Keyword Ideas screen
Let’s first examine the data that is presented on both screens and then walk 
through how to use that data.
Ad Group (By Relevance)  The ad groups are sorted by Google’s estimated relevance to the 
search method you used to find keyword ideas. If you click into an ad group, you will 
see the keyword data just for that ad group.
Keyword (By Relevance)  In the ad group screen, you will see a preview of a few keywords in 
that ad group. In the keyword ideas screen, you will see the keywords’ actual data and 
can sort the keywords by relevance, volume, competition level, and impression share. 
Trend Graph  If you hover over the graph icon, you can see the last few months’ trends for 
a keyword (Figure 3.12). Because this graph does not cover a full year, it is not good 
for predicting year-over-year seasonality. To get a better idea of seasonality, we will 
examine the Google Trends tool later in this chapter. This graph is good for a quick 

■  A dWor ds K ey wor d Pl a n n er 
71
look to see whether the keyword is increasing or decreasing in volume regardless of 
year-over-year changes.
Figure 3.12  Trended data
Average Monthly Searches  This is the average monthly search volume for that keyword. The 
Keyword Planner tool does not have the ability to see data by match type, so this infor-
mation is loosely based on broad match estimates. 
Competition  This is the amount of competition—high, medium, or low—that any one 
keyword has based on the number of advertisers in the location you are targeting. Just 
because a keyword has high or low competition does not mean the keyword will be 
necessarily be expensive or cheap.
Suggested Bid  This is a rough bid estimate based on the other bids in the targeted region. 
It usually has a rough correlation with the “top of page bid,” which is an estimated 
amount of the minimum you need to bid to have your ads displayed in one of the ad 
positions above the organic results. 
This is a suggestion only. You can get much more detailed information about how your 
bids impact your estimated clicks and impressions on the estimates screens.
Ad Impression Share  This is the percentage of times your ad has shown for this keyword 
when it was eligible to be displayed. 
Add To Plan  Finally, you will see an arrow to add a keyword to your plan. If the keyword 
is already in your account, there will be a notation on the arrow that the keyword is 
in the account. By clicking this button, you will either add all the keywords in an ad 
group to the plan or add an individual keyword to the plan if you are in the keyword 
or ad group details screen.
Now that you have an understanding of the data on this screen, let us take a 
look at how to work with the ad groups and keywords to build or expand an AdWords 
account.

Building Your Account with the Keyword Planner
From a high-level conceptual standpoint there are three ways to use this tool.
The first is how the tool was intended: Choose your ad groups and keywords 
to build or expand your account directly from the tool. This is the best use for newer 
advertisers. Because you can save your ad groups and keywords directly to your 
account, you can build out your account directly in the interface.
The second is to find new keywords and ideas that are not currently in your 
account. In this case, you will often add keywords to some existing ad groups and oth-
ers to brand-new ad groups. If you are adding a few keywords and ad groups, then the 
tool will accommodate your needs. If you are adding many new keywords to existing 
ad groups and also creating new ad groups, then the tool can be overly time consuming 
to use and you may want to download the data and import it using the AdWords Editor 
(covered in Chapter 12, “Saving Time and Scaling Accounts with the AdWords Editor”).
The last way to use the tool is for more advanced users. The one issue with the 
tool is that it does not easily allow you to add modified broad match keywords or even 
the same keyword with multiple match types to your account. In this case, you will 
often do your research into the tool and then download the data to a spreadsheet pro-
gram. Within the spreadsheet program, you can then do the following:
••
Manipulate the data, such as creating more granular ad groups for your keywords
••
Duplicate the data, such as adding the keyword twice in the account, each with 
its own match type
••
Change some match types to modified broad match
Once you have manipulated the data in a spreadsheet, you can then use the 
import function in the AdWords Editor to easily move the data into your account. 
In this section, we will mainly focus on using the tool to create new ad groups 
and populate them with keywords. If you can understand that basic usage of the tool, 
then the additional ways in which you can use it become obvious, especially after read-
ing the AdWords Editor section of Chapter 12.
Choosing Ad Groups and Keywords
The first step is to take a look at all the ad groups and determine which ones are suit-
able for your advertising needs. When you find an ad group that you want to add, do 
not just add the ad group. If you add the ad group, you will add all of the keywords in 
that ad group, and in many cases either there are unrelated keywords in that ad group 
or the ad group should be broken down into multiple ad groups before you save them 
to your account.
For example, if you are advertising flowers, one of the suggested ad groups is 
Same Day Delivery. Since many florists do offer same day delivery, at first glance this 
looks like a good ad group. However, when you examine the actual keywords that are 

■  A dWor ds K ey wor d Pl a n n er 
73
included in that ad group (Figure 3.13), you see that more than one suggestion is for 
gift basket delivery and not flower delivery.
Figure 3.13  Same Day Delivery suggested keywords
This is because the ad group suggestions are based on common keywords in the 
ad groups’ name. All of the suggestions do contain same day delivery; it’s just that not 
all of them are for a flower product.
In this case, you can add the individual keywords to your keyword research plan 
(Figure 3.14) that you want to use, but you would not want to add the entire ad group.
Figure 3.14  Keyword research plan data

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
74
Now that you have a plan, you will want to go back and add more keywords 
and ad groups to the plan. If you add more keywords to the plan, they will be added to 
the current ad group (in this case, it’s Flower Delivery). If you want to add keywords 
into new ad groups, you first need to create those new ad groups from within the plan 
by clicking the + button (Figure 3.15) and adding a new ad group.
Figure 3.15  Creating ad groups in a plan
In addition to using the plus button, you can click the edit button next to it and 
change the match types for your existing keywords or for new ones. If you are going to 
mix and match a lot of match types across your plan, it is much easier to download the 
data to a spreadsheet and manipulate the match types in that program instead of in the 
Keyword Planner tool.
As you are building out your plan with new keywords, you can also adjust the 
bid range of those keywords to see an overall estimate of the number of clicks and the 
total cost of those clicks for the keywords in your plan.
If you are not building a full ad group but instead just want to add individual 
keywords to your plan, instead of working from the Ad Group Ideas screen, you can 
work from the Keyword Ideas screen (Figure 3.16).
Figure 3.16  Working with keyword ideas

■  A dWor ds K ey wor d Pl a n n er 
75
This screen functions in the same way as the Ad Group Ideas screen with the 
exception that you are adding single keywords as opposed to full ad groups or single 
keywords within ad groups.
If you are building a new account, you will most likely start with the Search 
For New Keyword And Ad Group Ideas option, shown in Figure 3.17. If you start 
with this option and begin from a single keyword or phrase, then you will want to 
change the search query a few times to keep finding new keywords. An easy way of 
coming up with new words to input into the search tool is to take a look at the sug-
gested words from your initial query that either have so much search volume that you 
do not want to use them or are a little too general to use in an account; you can put 
those words back into the search tool to find more specific combinations related to 
that query.
If instead you start with inputting a word or phrase, at any time you can click 
Modify Search and then input a landing page that you are using (or go from one land-
ing page to a new one) or even look through categories for new ideas.
Figure 3.17  Modify Search screen
Once you have saved the ad group and keywords into a plan, you have four 
options; you can either download the data by clicking the down arrow, copy the key-
words to the clipboard by clicking the clipboard icon, delete the plan by clicking the 
trash can icon, or get detailed estimates for your keywords by clicking the Review 
Estimates button (Figure 3.18).

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
76
Figure 3.18  Downloading, copying, deleting, or  
reviewing estimates for your plan data
The estimates screen then allows you to get details about your click volume, 
estimated costs, and initial CPC data.. First, we’ll cover all the ways you can get to the 
estimates screen, and then we will dig into how to work with the estimates.
Traffic Estimates
Finding keyword ideas is one half of the Keyword Planner tool; the second half is esti-
mating traffic based on ad group and keyword data. 
There are several ways you can reach the Traffic Estimator tool. The first is 
to research keywords and ad groups, as discussed previously, and then review your 
estimates. The other methods are through the initial research screen of the Keyword 
Planner tool (Figure 3.19).
Figure 3.19  Keyword research options
One option is to Get Search Volume For A List Of Keywords Or Group Them 
Into Ad Groups (Figure 3.20).

■  A dWor ds K ey wor d Pl a n n er 
77
Figure 3.20  Get Search Volume For A List Of Keywords screen
With this option you either type a list into the box, copy and paste a list from 
another program, or upload a list of keywords into the tool. You also have targeting 
options available as you do with some of the other research methods. Once you click 
Get Search Volume, you will be taken into the Ad Group And Keyword Ideas screen, 
as with the first option. If you want to get only estimates for these keywords, you can 
then click Add All and then Get Estimates to jump to the review screen. If you want to 
organize the keywords into ad groups, you can do so from the Ad Group And Keyword 
Ideas screen; however, it is much easier to do this grouping in a spreadsheet program 
than in the tool.
The next option is Get Traffic Estimates For A List Of Keywords. This is almost 
the same as the previous option (Get Search Volume For A List Of Keywords Or 
Group Them Into Ad Groups), except it jumps you directly to the estimates screen and 
bypasses the Ad Group And Keyword Ideas Wizard.
The last option is Multiply Keyword Lists To Get New Keyword Ideas 
(Figure 3.21). With this option, you can put lists of keywords into the input boxes, and 
then Google will combine these words to give you estimates. 

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
78
Figure 3.21  Estimating from keyword lists
Regardless of the method you use to create your keyword lists, in the end, all 
the tools can take you into the Traffic Estimator portion of the Keyword Planner tool, 
where you can review estimates and get a sense of potential clicks and costs for your 
keywords.
Working with Traffic Estimates
When you first arrive at the Traffic Estimator screen, the first thing you will notice is a 
large chart that shows you how many clicks per day you can expect to receive based on 
all of the keywords you have selected (Figure 3.22).
Figure 3.22  Estimated clicks per day

■  A dWor ds K ey wor d Pl a n n er 
79
You can hover over the chart and see your estimated cost, clicks, and impres-
sions per day. This is an aggregate for all the keywords inside the planner. If you 
want to see the chart for just one ad group, then you will have to remove the other ad 
groups. You can view the chart by clicks, impressions, or cost per day. A good way 
to understand the change in impressions for top versus side of the page is to view the 
impression data and look for the large jump in impressions (Figure 3.23).
Figure 3.23  Estimating impressions per day
If you are looking to gain exposure for your new keywords right away and you 
have the budget to spend, then picking a starting CPC at the top of the jump will give 
you many clicks but at a higher cost per click. If you have a smaller budget, then you 
will often want to start with a lower CPC and look to see where you can receive the 
most clicks for your budget.
Near the bottom of the screen, you can see details about each of your ad groups 
(Figure 3.24). By default, no data is shown for the estimates traffic. To see data for 
each ad group, near the top of the page is an Enter A Bid box. Once you enter a bid 
into that box, you can see traffic estimates for each ad group.
Figure 3.24  Ad group estimates
If you just want to see the maximum traffic that is possible per ad group, put a 
very large bid, such as $100, into the bid box, so that you can see all the potential traffic. 

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
80
If you want to see the estimated traffic by ad group for a specific bid, you can 
either enter a bid or click into the graph, and the tool will show you where your bid 
falls on the graph (Figure 3.25) as well as the estimated traffic per ad group.
Figure 3.25  Estimating ad group data in both the chart and the table
If all of the keywords you added require a very low bid, then you might not 
receive any impressions because your bids might be below first-page bids (the minimum 
amount you must bid for your ad to be displayed on page one of the search results). 
In that case, you can either add all the keywords to your account, knowing that many 
might not get impressions, and see what actually happens or remove some of your key-
words or ad groups until you find a nice balance between your budget and the poten-
tial traffic those keywords will bring you.
One thing to keep in mind is that this tool does not access your real Quality 
Score data, and therefore average CPC and position are only rough estimates. You 
should use your common sense and the historical information you have learned about 
your industry to determine how useful those two numbers are to your specific account. 
It is common to see the actual data from an account not exactly match the estimates.
Usually, if you are estimating at a country level, then the data is generally (and 
there are many exceptions) within 10 to 20 percent of what you actually see once the 
words are live. If you are estimating at a city level (meaning your targeting includes 
only a city and not an entire country), then it is common for the tool to underestimate 
your traffic by 200 to 500 percent. 
Within this screen, you can view the data by ad group or by keyword. You can 
also add and remove ad groups or change your targeting.

Estimating Modified Broad Match
There is no way to estimate modified broad match with the AdWords Keyword Planner tool. Here are 
some general guidelines to get closer to estimating modified broad match. 
For keywords three words in length that have a term in common that has decent search volume (for 
example, in cheap web hosting, inexpensive web hosting, and the like, web hosting is the word they all 
share in common), estimate the two-word term at phrase match if you are planning on adding most of 
these various terms as keywords across multiple ad groups. You will know that in aggregate you will 
probably capture one-third to one-half of the traffic across all the ad groups—although you will not 
know exactly what ad group will end up with what traffic. This is a rough estimate at best. 
For keywords of four words that do not have high search volume, estimate at broad match and you 
will probably capture 50–75 percent of that search volume.
It is easy to give guidelines for estimating based on how many words are in a keyword, but you should 
also keep in mind how concrete or abstract the idea of the keyword is. For instance, Los Angeles Lakers 
uniform is one overall idea even though it contains four words, whereas paternity testing is also one 
idea at just two words. 
Treat these as overall guidelines, but remember that they are not perfect since the number of ideas in 
a keyword is just as important as the number of words in that keyword.
Once you are satisfied with the estimated bids, then you can either download the 
data or save the data to an existing or new campaign (Figure 3.26).
Figure 3.26  Saving the data to a new campaign

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
82
When you save the data to a new or existing campaign, be aware that you can 
specify only one bid, and that bid will apply to every new ad group you are creat-
ing. We will cover determining initial bids and setting bids in much more detail in 
Chapter 13, “Devising Profitable Bid Strategies”; however, if you do want to use very 
different bids by ad group, it is useful to save your data and estimates through the 
download option so that once you save the ad groups to your account, you can quickly 
change the starting bids to your desired amounts.
Using the Keyword Planner tool should make it easy to find new ad groups, pop-
ulate those ad groups with keywords, and then determine costs and starting CPCs in 
one easy tool. While this process is simple, do not be afraid to create much more gran-
ular ad groups than the tool suggests. Feel free to download the data into a spreadsheet 
program, manipulate the organization and match types, and then use the AdWords 
Editor to create your new ad groups. The tool is a good starting place and is great for 
new advertisers, but more seasoned advertisers will use it as a research tool and then 
manipulate the data before the information goes live in an account.
AdWords Keyword Planner vs. Third-Party Keyword Tools
Many keyword tools are available that can help you learn more about your keywords. 
The most popular, and one of the original keyword tools, is Wordtracker.
Wordtracker draws its data from a few metasearch engines, such as Dogpile 
.com. These meta-engines did have decent search volume years ago when pay-per-click 
(PPC) was new. However, they make up a minuscule amount of the search volume. 
Wordtracker takes the data it receives from these engines and extrapolates the numbers 
to determine search volume. Estimating search volume from such a small data set often 
creates a significant difference in the suggested search volume versus the impression 
you receive when you advertise on those same keywords.
Other popular tools include WordStream, SEMrush, iSpionage, and 
KeywordSpy, among others. These tools draw data from a variety of sources and 
attempt to estimate search volume.
Because Google accounts for roughly 70 percent of all search volume in the 
United States (and higher in many European countries), it is often best to rely on 
Google’s numbers to estimate traffic. If you are doing some advanced calculations, you 
can use multiple data sets together to attempt to determine search numbers.
However, that does not mean that these other tools are useless. Quite the con-
trary—when you are doing specific research into wide and deep keywords, they have 
some nice features that help you dig into your keyword lists. They are useful for key-
word research and are tools I use on occasion—just be careful of the search volume 
numbers.
Several of these tools have free trials. This makes it easy to test their keyword 
research capabilities to see if they work for you before committing any money.

Google Trends
Google Trends (www.google.com/trends) is a tool that lets you see how search queries 
have risen and fallen over time. You can gain many insights by examining the trends of 
search queries. In an online world, it is easy to forget the lessons taught through hun-
dreds of years of data from the offline world.
A brick-and-mortar store has a limited amount of inventory. Each month they 
have to consider the goods that will need to be stocked in the upcoming months based 
on what will sell in the store. If a store stocks goods that are not sold, that wasted 
space can lead to a loss of profits. The inventory specialist examines what goods were 
sold in the previous years in order to predict the inventory they need in the store in any 
given month.
Almost every business has some seasonality. Seasonality in the flower industry 
is one of the most obvious. Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, Easter, and similar holi-
days have correlations with spikes in searches, sales, and even conversion rates. Even 
an office supply store will see trends in its sales. During various holidays, spikes will 
occur in the number of searches for holiday stationery and printable cards. At Father’s 
Day, it is common to see a spike for Cross pens, a popular Father’s Day gift. During 
Christmas, high-end pens such as Waterman or Montblanc see search spikes (see 
Figure 3.27), even though overall trends for buying luxury pens have decreased signifi-
cantly in the past several years.
Figure 3.27  Trend data for Cross, Waterman, and Montblanc pens

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
84
Not all seasonality is driven by holidays. An office supply store will want to 
stock low-cost laptops and computer desks in the fall when the college semester starts. 
It is always important to keep in mind the daily factors of life that drive search and 
buying behavior.
When you examine AdWords reports, which we will cover throughout this 
book, you are always looking back in time at data. If you are making bid or budget 
decisions by utilizing only the past month or two of data, you are missing possible 
changes in conversion rates and search behavior that are driven by trends that may 
occur only a few times a year. If you sell computer desks, it can be useful to make 
changes to your inventory and ad copy based on the fall back-to-school season versus 
the spring, when both people and businesses move and need new furniture. Instead of 
making changes based on your account’s past history, examine the history to project 
changes to conversion rates, sales, bids, and budgets.
This is where Google Trends shines. It is a free tool that will display changes 
in keyword search volume or even in visitors to a website. You can segment this data 
by various time frames and by regions. Once you have the data, you can click into a 
region to drill down into states and cities.
The most important thing to note when examining the region, city, and lan-
guage data is that it is normalized by population (see Figure 3.28). The data shows 
the likelihood of that search term being used in that language or region. In the chart 
shown in Figure 3.28, the data does not mean that Ireland and the United Kingdom 
conduct more searches for Cross pens than the United States. It means there is a higher 
chance of a user in one of those countries searching for a Cross pen than in the United 
States.
Figure 3.28  Search trend information normalized by population

■  Google T r en ds
85
You can refine the data within Google Trends in several ways:
••
Country
••
Years
••
Categories
••
Search type (images, news, and so on)
Most of those criteria are self-explanatory. However, the one to draw additional 
attention to is the Category filter. When you use the Category filter, the tool will show 
you only the change in volume for that specific category. This is useful when a term 
can fall into multiple categories and your products or services are based within a single 
category.
There are several useful ways of using Google Trends based on the type of infor-
mation you need to know. Let’s look at a few examples of how to use the tool to gain 
insights into your marketing activities. 
What Services Should You Offer?
If you have several services, it would be useful to know which ones have higher search 
volumes and how those volumes change so you know where to focus your online mar-
keting efforts.
With Google Trends, it is easy to compare several items to see which has a 
higher search volume and if there are definitive trends. If you are a plumber who spe-
cializes in kitchen and bathroom remodeling, where should you spend more time opti-
mizing your search marketing (see Figure 3.29)?
Figure 3.29  Kitchen remodeling vs. bathroom remodeling search information

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
86
In Figure 3.29, you can clearly see that the trends for kitchen remodeling and 
bathroom remodeling are similar. Before 2009, kitchen remodeling had a higher search 
volume. Starting in 2009, bathroom remodeling took over the higher search volume of 
the two options. By examining trend data, you can see that you should have switched 
your focus from kitchens to bathrooms in 2009. 
What happened with the collapse of the real estate market is that people wanted 
to remodel to sell their homes. However, bathrooms are much cheaper to remodel than 
kitchens. Therefore, advice from real estate agents became redo the bathroom instead 
of the older advice of redo the kitchen in order to get the house ready to sell. Although 
it is useful to bid on both of these terms, there is a higher possible payoff when you 
focus more attention on bathroom remodeling because the search volume is higher.
More drill-downs are available on the page. Below the search volume chart 
is a chart that shows regions and a heat map based on the search volume in various 
regions. You can view this information at a country, region (state), or city level.
If you tailor your search campaigns for geographic regions (which will be cov-
ered in depth in Chapter 11), you can gain more insight by drilling down into vari-
ous regions. For instance, you can look at the initial data and see that there are a few 
locations that appear to have a higher interest in kitchen remodeling than bathroom 
remodeling. You can then use the locations search feature (Figure 3.30) to compare a 
search term in multiple geographies at once.
For instance, if you were a Washington, DC, plumber, it would be useful to 
know that Washington is one of the few regions where there is more search volume 
for kitchen remodeling than bathroom remodeling (see Figure 3.30). Therefore, a 
Washington plumber might focus his campaign differently than a Dallas plumber, who 
sees the exact opposite in terms of top searches.
Figure 3.30  Kitchen remodeling search volume

■  Google T r en ds
87
Lastly, at the bottom of the Google Trends page, you can find related infor-
mation about top searches and raising searches. The top searches are just what 
they sound like—the top searched keywords related to the keywords you chose and 
the geographic region. If you choose different regions, you may see the top related 
searches change as well.
The top gaining searches are words that have gained in popularity based on the 
time frame you chose. It is useful to select the past year, or even the past 90 days in a 
quick-changing industry, to see what additional words are gaining in search volume. 
This can be useful to determine whether there are new products you should offer (see 
Figure 3.31). Occasionally you may see a word labeled breakout. This means the search 
volume has changed by more than 5,000 percent. If it is related to your business, it is a 
trend you want to make sure your company is aware of and possibly testing.
Figure 3.31  Top searches and rising searches for kitchen remodeling
In this case, you see that some of the top rising searches involve kitchen remod-
eling pictures and kitchen remodeling costs. Therefore, including these words in your 
keyword list and showing some pictures and cost estimates on your landing page are 
good ideas.
Determining Your Messaging
If you are selling cars, should you promote a family car or a luxury car? What about 
car safety versus fuel efficiency versus financing? If you could compare the search vol-
ume for these different aspects of a product, it could help you decide how to position 
your product, as shown in Figure 3.32.
In Figure 3.32, you can see that the search volume changes slightly for family 
versus luxury cars, with family cars having a slight edge. This might not be enough of 
a difference for you to change your product positioning.

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
88
Figure 3.32  Comparing car positioning
However, it becomes easy to see that gas mileage is much more important than 
either safety or auto financing. Several years ago, car safety was the most important 
aspect of buying a car. From 2005 to 2008, safety and gas mileage vied back and forth 
for the top searches. Starting in 2008 with the change in the economy, gas mileage has 
consistently beaten other aspects of car buying. 
By comparing features of your products, you can see which features have higher 
search volume and are often a larger consumer concern. This knowledge can help 
shape your ad copy and landing pages to address the consumer’s greatest questions.
Determining Consumer Interest
If you are expanding your market, knowing which areas have a greater interest in your 
product can help you create test markets and determine where your expansions will 
have the best chance for success.
For example, if you created an add-on for the popular Microsoft Xbox game 
console, where should you market your product? You could attempt to look at mar-
ket interest by individual city or by country. How much do you want to expand your 
marketplace?
By comparing searches for Xbox across different geographies (see Figure 3.33), 
you can determine a list of regions where the interest for Xbox is high. Because Google 
Insights for Search shows interest, and not total search volume, you will need to refer-
ence this information with the actual population size, but Google Insights for Search 
creates a much easier starting place for your additional research.

There are many other creative ways you can use Google Trends. Whenever you 
are conducting research that involves keywords, locations, or trends, keep it in mind to 
see how you can use this tool to help with your research.
Bing Ads Intelligence
Google sunsetted their labs products in 2011, and many useful products were removed. 
However, Microsoft has come to the rescue with a great suite of products known as 
Bing Ads Intelligence.
Bing Ads Intelligence is an Excel plug-in tool, so you must own a copy of Excel to 
use it. In addition, you must have a Bing Ads account (it does not have to spend money, 
but you must have an account). If you own Excel and have a Bing Ads advertising 
account, you can download the plug-in from http://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/
en-us/bing-ads-intelligence.
There are many useful data points you can see within the tool, and most are self-
explanatory. I also suggest taking a look at the demographics for your keywords just to 
make sure you are reaching the correct audience. For instance, Figure 3.34 shows the 
demographic data for the word bleach.
Figure 3.34  Bing Ads Intelligence data for the word bleach
By looking at this data, you can see that the major demographics for the word 
bleach are young males and not what most people think, which are females looking 
for Clorox bleach information. When you see outliers in demographic associations for 
your keywords, you should view that as a signal to learn more about that keyword.

Chapter 3:  K ey wor d Tool s: Ex t r ac t i ng Va lua ble Data from Google  ■
90
I suggest downloading the tool and playing with the features. We could spend 
another 100 pages talking about how to use all the options of this tool. Suffice it to say, 
if you are advertising in a region where Bing has decent search volume, this tool will 
help you gain more insight into keywords for any PPC campaign.
The most important point to remember about tools is that they are only as good 
as their inputs and interpretations. If you put bad data into a tool, you will see bad 
data come out of the tool. If you do not understand the information being presented, or 
the business rules behind how the data is calculated, you may not be able to interpret 
the data to come to the correct conclusions.
Understanding what the tool does and how it calculates and presents the data is 
crucial in extracting valuable, actionable data from any toolset.
Best Practices for Using Keyword Tools
Keyword tools do not tell you what keywords you should use; they give you keyword 
suggestions that you can choose to either use or bypass. Using keyword tools is essen-
tial to researching the full breadth of keyword possibilities for your account. Keywords 
are thought processes, and everyone thinks differently.
••
The Keywords Planner should be one of the first tools you utilize when you are 
conducting keyword research.
••
Use the Search For New Keyword And Ad Group Ideas option of the Keyword 
Planner when you have one or more words and would like suggestions based on 
that information.
••
Use the landing page option in the Keyword Planner when you wish to extract 
data from a website. Try entering your website, your competitor’s website, 
search results, or the dictionary to find new keywords. Whenever you see a page 
on the Web and think that page is highly related to your products, enter the page 
into the tool to see if there are new keywords that are relevant to your account.
••
Once you find keywords with the Keyword Planner, you can either estimate traf-
fic for those keywords or export them for organization for later use.
••
To estimate traffic for your keywords and ad group, use the estimate section in 
the Keyword Planner.
••
When estimating traffic, you must input a bid into the bid box to see data by ad 
group.
••
Use the graph in the Keyword Planner estimates to determine the best starting 
bid for your budget.
••
Google Trends is useful for looking backward in time to help you project 
changes in keyword search volume.

••
Always remember with Google Trends that the data is not absolute but is relative 
to the geography’s population size and the propensity of its inhabitants to search 
for a keyword or visit a particular site.
••
Google Trends can help you in many unique ways, such as by crafting marketing 
messages or seeing the differences between multiple locations.
Finding keywords is not difficult, although it can be time consuming. It’s impor-
tant that you understand the search intent behind the keyword; that way, you can show 
the searchers compelling ad copy so they will visit your website. In the next chapter, we 
will discuss how to write effective ads based on the keywords you have found.

Writing 
Compelling Ads
Ads are the only part of your AdWords account 
a consumer will ever see. When a searcher sees 
your ad, the ad needs to stand up, wave its 
arms, jump up and down, and shout, “I have 
the answer to your question!”
However, there are many subtleties to 
­writing ad copy. The messaging, value proposi-
tion, editorial requirements, and information 
need to be tightly wrapped into just a few char-
acters. Accomplishing this type of writing can be 
quite tricky.

Do Your Ads Reflect the Search Query?
Ads serve as a bridge between the search query and your landing page. Your goal is to 
have enticing ad copy that causes a user to “cross the bridge” from a search result and 
arrive at your website.
AdWords ads do not need to be gimmicky. The ads need to quickly convey to the 
consumer that the answer to their search can be found on your website. If your ad has 
enticed someone to cross the bridge, the ad copy has done its job.
Of course, it’s not quite that simple. There are many types of bridges. Some ads 
emphasize conversions, and others focus on clicks. Your job is to build an ad that pro-
duces results for your company, based on your company’s goals, by bringing the correct 
prospects to your website.
The ad should reflect both the keywords in your account and the user’s search 
query. If the ad is not highly relevant to both of those items, it will be less effective 
(Figure 4.1). Ad copy that does not cover both the search query and your keywords is 
like a bridge that leads to nowhere. Either your ad leads someone to the answer to their 
question, or it leads off in an irrelevant direction. Make sure you are always bringing 
the consumer closer to the answer to their question, assuming the answer is a conver-
sion on your website.
Therefore, it is imperative that you go through the exercise of ensuring that your 
ad copy will be reflective of your keywords and the search query. Since you know your 
keywords and what type of related queries should trigger them (refer to the search query 
report in Chapter 16, “AdWords Reports: Extracting Actionable Information”), one 
of the most important exercises to undertake before writing ads is to ensure you have 
granular account organization. I will mention this concept several times throughout this 
book because this organization can determine the effectiveness of your account.
Figure 4.1  For the highly commercial search buy LED TV,  
these ads do not speak to the user’s query.

About Ad Copy Screenshots
Most of the ad copy screenshots are taken from within the AdWords interface. Therefore, they will 
not look identical to what you see on the Web. For instance, on the Web Google puts the display URL 
just below the headline. Within the interface, they still have the display URL in the old slot, which is 
just below the description line 2. Google often tweaks how ads are displayed within search results, 
so the ads may not mirror exactly how Google displays them. However, the concepts we will discuss 
throughout this book for writing ad copy remain the same regardless of a few minor changes to the 
ad’s display.
Granular account organization means that the keywords in an ad group are 
highly related and you do not see additional ways to separate out the keywords. In 
addition, your ad copy should reflect every single keyword in your ad group. For exam-
ple, let’s say your ad group is about HDTVs and contains these keywords:
••
LED TV
••
Plasma TV
••
HDTV
••
Hi-def TV
With these keywords, your ad group is not granular enough. The keywords 
could be in several different ad groups: one for plasma TVs, one for LED TVs, and  
so on.
First, write an ad with one explicit meaning. Imagine that if someone saw this 
ad, they could assume you do only this one particular thing, such as you only offer 
weekend plumbing services, small business accounting solutions, or used books less 
than $5. Now, look at your keywords. Does the ad copy reflect the keywords? If yes, 
the keywords are in the correct place. If no, move the keywords to a new ad group.
Consider someone who searches for buy plasma tv and sees the two ads shown 
in Figure 4.2.
Figure 4.2  Buy plasma TV ad copy

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
96
Which one would you click? While a plasma TV is a hi-def TV, there are other 
types of hi-def TVs, such as LED or LCD. The use of the word buy in the query 
informs us that this is a commercial query with high purchase intent. This searcher is 
not likely to change their TV choice from a plasma TV. Therefore, you would want to 
show this searcher a plasma TV ad.
The exercise of breaking down your ad groups into specific keyword and ad 
copy combinations will take a while, but it will assist greatly in ad copy writing. 
Because you now only have to reflect one specific theme in your ad copy, you only need 
to write ads for one explicit meaning.
Note:  It is much better to have 100 ad groups of 10 keywords than to have one ad group of 1,000 keywords. 
When it comes to searching, there is no magical number of keywords that belong in an ad group. When you go to 
organize your ad groups, it is vital that you make sure the keywords and ad copy are closely related.
Writing Effective Ads
Once your granular ad group organization is completed, it is time to think about the 
content of the ad copy. There are many ways of writing ad copy, some of which we will 
revisit in Chapter 15, “Implementing Testing Techniques That Will Increase Profits,” 
when we discuss ways of testing different ad copy messages to see which are more 
effective.
Note:  If you have a dozen ideas for ad copy, which one is best? There is no way to know without running a 
test to find out which ad has a higher conversion rate or click-through rate (CTR). Split testing is essentially testing 
multiple elements (such as ad copy or landing pages) to find out which is the best for your business.
Ad copy must promote your goals for success. Before you begin advertising, it is 
important to determine the goals for your campaigns (which will be discussed in depth 
in Chapter 13, “Devising Profitable Bid Strategies”). Once you have established the 
goals, your ads should reflect those goals.
Your ad should display your products’ features and benefits. This is so impor-
tant that an upcoming section (“Distinguishing Features and Benefits”) focuses on this 
aspect of your ad.
You want to make sure that the consumer identifies with your ad copy. 
Marketing is about identifying and connecting with consumers. Using your consum-
ers’ language is important. If you use terms that your consumers do not understand or 
terms they do not often see, it can cause them to not identify with your ad copy and 
click on a competitor’s ad instead of yours (Figure 4.3).

■  W r i t i ng Ef f ec t i v e A ds

Figure 4.3  How many ads do you understand?
Using Words Consumers Understand
It is useful to read the work of writers and columnists who write about your local area and industry. If 
you are advertising in a specific location, the local newspaper columnists usually try to make interest-
ing points about that particular area within their column. If you see words that are not typically used 
in your location, these could be words that are common to another area (which could be state, city, 
or country). By reading the local columnists, you can find words your audience understands and finds 
familiar. This is a fantastic place to find some unusual adjectives to test in ad copy.
Each industry can get lost in its own jargon, but consumers often do not know these industry words. 
Read magazine reviews of your products and services that are written for the general populace and 
not just your industry. When you find places where you feel the words or concepts are not quite 
accurate, the wrong word is being used, or a common word is used instead of a specific one (denoting 
jargon), note that these words might be used because the general populace does not understand the 
jargon. If you are using this jargon, do you think consumers can understand your ad?
Calls to Action
Direct a consumer to take action. What do you want someone to do once they arrive at 
your site? When you tell someone what to do within the ad copy, it is going to predis-
pose them to look for that action on the landing page. Some generic examples of calls 
to action are these:
••
Call us today.
••
Subscribe to our newsletter.
••
Download our whitepaper.
Those who do not wish to take such action may not even click on your ad. If you 
are looking to increase CTR and views to a new product page (regardless of who buys 

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
98
the product), you may not want to add a purchasing or prequalifying call to action 
within the ad copy because it could lower CTR. This will be discussed in more depth 
in Chapter 6, “Learning Advanced Optimization Techniques,” when we examine opti-
mizing your account for conversions.
Often in search advertising, a straightforward marketing message connects cere-
brally with visitors. By using logic and informational ad copy, you are trusting that the 
consumers can make decisions if they are presented with all the facts. This is very use-
ful in ad copy writing—the purpose is to answer a searcher’s question, and an answer 
is made up of facts. This is also useful when you are trying to reach consumers who 
do intensive research before making a decision, which is common in B2B and techni-
cal fields. However, you will see higher CTRs and conversion rates if you also connect 
emotionally with a visitor.
Touching the Emotional Core
It is possible to connect both informationally and emotionally with a searcher. There 
are some common assumptions about what any person wants and what they would 
most likely try to avoid:
What people want:
••
More control
••
Independence
••
Freedom
••
More time
••
More money
••
Better health
••
Better appearance
••
Promotions at work
••
To feel included
••
Social advancement
••
To be appreciated
••
Security
••
Confidence
••
Enjoyment
What people try to avoid:
••
More work
••
Unacceptable risk
••
Doubt
••
Criticism
••
Guilt

Being ignored
By combining emotional and informational factors (Figure 4.4), you can create 
ads that elicit emotional responses in your visitors while still directing them to find 
their necessary information on your website.

Following Google’s Editorial Guidelines
Before we continue examining different aspects of ad copy writing and creating effec-
tive ads, let’s examine the editorial policies. If an ad will not be approved by Google to 
show on a search result, there is no need to waste your time writing that type of ad.
Google has gone to great lengths to ensure that ads meet a certain standard before 
being shown to their visitors. Because one of Google’s major success metrics is a returning 
visitor, they want to ensure that the ads are just as relevant as the natural search results.
Character Lengths
The first consideration is character length. There are stringent requirements for how 
many characters can appear in an ad, as shown in Table 4.1.
▶
▶Table 4.1  Character lengths
Ad copy section
Character length
Headline
25
Description line 1

Display URL

Destination URL
2,048

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
100
It is commonly said that the best headline is 26 characters. Attempting to write 
creative marketing messages using 95 characters is difficult and takes some time to 
master. This is why it is important to test different messages.
Even though description lines 1 and 2 appear as different lines when ads are 
created, it can also be useful to test writing one 70-character sentence to see if the ad 
reads better as a single sentence than as two distinctive messages on separate lines. 
This is especially true if your ad regularly appears at the top of the page, where the two 
description lines are run together.
Note:  If your ad is shown above the organic results and your description line 1 ends in a punctuation mark 
(period, question mark, exclamation mark), Google may combine your headline and description line 1 into a long 
60-character headline.
These headlines stand out on search results and many times increase CTRs. This is one of the easiest ways to 
increase your ad’s CTR.
Editorial Requirements
The most ambiguous of the editorial rules is “accurate ad text.” While Google explains 
this requirement as ensuring that your ad reflects what the consumer will find on your 
landing page, it is also a rule they can fall back on if they want to disapprove ad copy 
for various reasons.
Following this rule is important for conversion rates. If your ad copy claims 
the user will find something on your landing page and that item is not there, the user 
will hit the Back button and you have just wasted the price of the click. Following this 
rule can also help your Quality Score (discussed in depth in future chapters) since “rel-
evancy” is a word Google uses repeatedly to describe their AdWords program.
The second rule is accurate capitalization. Although you can capitalize the first 
letter of each individual word, you cannot have a word in all caps: exceptions include 
acronyms or words that naturally always appear in all caps. For instance, if you wrote 
the ad copy “FREE Software,” the ad would be disapproved because “FREE” is not 
a word that should appear in all caps. However, if your ad copy was “Learn PPC 
Marketing,” this would be approved because the acronym PPC should be in all caps.
You must back up all competitive claims on the landing page. If you claim that 
your product is better than another product, you need supporting evidence on that 
page. This could be an accurate comparison chart or testimony from a third party who 
has verified that information.
All ads must use proper grammar and spelling. You cannot use misspellings in 
ad copy, with the exception of some common misspellings or words that have alternate 
spellings. For instance, the words optimize and optimise are both acceptable because 

■  Follow i ng Google’s Edi tor i a l Gu i deli n e s
101
they are alternate spellings of the same word (optimise is the British spelling; optimize 
is the American spelling).
Ads cannot have offensive or inappropriate language. This is another ambiguous 
rule that helps to keep out of search results hate-based ads, some adult ads, and other 
offensive items.
If you make a claim of a price, discount, or special offer, you must show the 
consumer that offer within two clicks from your landing page. If you make the claim 
that DVDs are 60 percent off and that offer is not on your site, the ad violates Google 
editorial policy. Following this rule will also help conversion rates. If you make a claim 
of free shipping and a searcher navigates throughout your site and is about to check out 
but has yet to determine if they will receive free shipping, odds are they will not enter 
their credit card information.
You must use proper punctuation marks and symbols. This means you cannot 
bullet-point each line of your ads to make them look different on a search result. In 
addition, an ad can have only one exclamation point, and that exclamation point can-
not be in the headline. We will discuss trademarks and copyrights later in this chapter; 
however, since there are so few symbols used in ad copy, adding the ®, ©, or ™ sym-
bol (assuming you have the right to use it) can help make your ad stand out from the 
other ads.
You cannot repeat the same word multiple times in a row in ad copy. For 
instance, “Free Free Free” ads would be disapproved for gimmicky repetition.
In general, superlatives such as “best” or “#1” are disapproved in ad copy. The 
exception is if you can prove it. If you claim to be the best at something, you will need 
third-party verification. If you do have third-party verification, it can be useful to use 
a word such as “best” in your ad copy, since very few other ads will make superlative 
claims. However, you can use nonabsolute claims such as “leading,” “popular,” “top-
rated,” and others that make claims to be one of the best, but not the absolute best 
without third-party verification.
You also cannot imply a Google affiliation or relationship that does not exist. 
Making the claim of “Recommended by Google” will be disapproved in almost all 
cases.
There are specific policies by industry as well. You can see Google’s industry-
specific policies in their Help section: https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/
topic/1626336?hl=en&ref_topic=2996750.
Although some of the editorial restrictions can be annoying, in general they fos-
ter an environment of fair play between advertisers and help consumers find their infor-
mation. Following the relevancy aspects of the editorial guidelines often leads to higher 
conversion rates and more profit for your company. Knowing the editorial restrictions 
will help you create ads that will be approved by editorial so you do not have to keep 
trying new ads in hopes of them becoming approved. Too many companies spend time 

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
102
trying to work around the restrictions, which just creates short-term work that does 
not give long-term results. The goal of writing ads within the editorial guidelines is to 
find unique ways to differentiate your ads regardless of any restrictions.
Developing Unique Selling Propositions
Why should someone buy from you instead of your competitor? That is one of the fun-
damental questions you need to answer about your business, because it should perme-
ate your marketing efforts.
To visualize different unique selling propositions, it is easy to turn to the car 
industry. What is the first thought that pops into your mind as you read this list of cars?
••
Porsche
••
BMW
••
Ferrari
••
Lexus
••
Subaru
••
Volvo
Lexus, BMW, Porsche, and Ferrari are all luxury cars that will make a serious 
dent in your wallet. However, even among these cars differences exist in their unique 
selling propositions (USPs). A Porsche can be driven off a lot and raced that same day. 
A Ferrari is a status symbol that stands out wherever it is seen. A BMW is a German-
engineered luxury driving machine. Lexus is the pursuit of driving perfection.
Volvos often tout their safety record, while a Subaru is great for all-weather 
driving. That does not mean a Subaru is not a safe car or that a Volvo cannot drive 
well in the snow. These are marketing statements that are top-of-mind to consumers 
when they consider which cars to purchase.
These are extreme scenarios dealing with companies who have many years and 
billions of dollars behind their marketing efforts, but any business can come up with 
something unique about their particular company. You can find anything at eBay. You 
can compare insurance quotes from competitors at Progressive. Customize your new 
computer at Dell. Zappos is powered by service.
If you are unsure of what your USP should be, you can test this through 
AdWords ads. Create several different ads with different USPs and see which ones 
gather the highest CTR and conversion rates on your website. (For full details on test-
ing ad copy, please refer to Chapter 15.)
If you are a local company that advertises against national companies, your USP 
may include the fact that your business is local and someone can walk into your office 
or easily call and talk to a human.

■  Dist i ngu ish i ng F e at u r e s a n d Ben ef i ts
103
By choosing a USP that is core to your business, it is easier to make decisions 
about how to position yourself in the marketplace. The USP also makes for a good line 
of ad copy because it showcases why someone would want to do business with your 
company. Do not blend into the crowd. Stand apart by showcasing your company’s 
uniqueness.
Distinguishing Features and Benefits
Features and benefits are often misunderstood. They are very different, and each has its 
own place within the buying funnel.
A feature is a component or function of your products and services. This is often 
the big list of details found on the outside of a product’s box or included in the PDF 
description of a product. Features are facts about the product or services. Features are 
easy to list—just create a bullet point list about the product.
For instance, this book is being written on a Sony Vaio laptop with these 
features:
••
11.1-inch wide screen display
••
8 GB of memory
••
256 GB solid-state drive
••
Intel 440 graphics card
••
14-hour battery life
••
Carbon fiber casing
••
Built-in webcam
••
Weight: 1.92 pounds
This list could go on for hundreds of bullet points. Look at any product or ser-
vice, and start writing down its components. Features are easy to determine.
A benefit is something the product or service will do for you. How will the ser-
vice make your life better? Why should you spend your hard-earned money on a par-
ticular product? Essentially, if you can answer “What’s in it for me?” you’ve come up 
with the product’s benefits. Benefits are based on evoking emotional responses.
It is easy to turn a feature into a benefit by adding a “so,” “to,” or “will” to the 
end of the feature and completing the sentence.
••
The laptop has a 14-hour battery life so you can be productive on an interna-
tional flight.
••
The Sony Vaio weighs less than two pounds to save your back from excessive 
strain.
••
Having 8 GB of memory will easily let you analyze a million rows of Excel files 
to find the most profitable keywords.

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
104
••
You can use the built-in webcam to see your family when you are traveling.
••
The carbon fiber casing will protect your investment if you accidentally drop 
your laptop.
Always keep your customer in mind when creating your benefits. If your cus-
tomer does not travel, a 14-hour battery life might not be a benefit. However, if your 
customer is constantly examining large Excel files to optimize keyword lists, being able 
to manipulate a million rows in Excel could save them both time and money.
You can take the extra step of segmenting your customers into different demo-
graphics and then examining what features and benefits are most important to each 
segment. For instance, if you sold the Sony Vaio laptop I just described, which features 
and benefits would be most beneficial to these groups?
••
Frequent travelers
••
Gamers
••
PPC marketers
By segmenting your audience into groups, you can send custom messages to 
those users. This can sometimes be difficult with keywords on the search network; 
however, across the content network (discussed in Chapter 9, “Understanding the 
Display Network”), you can examine the demographics of individual websites and then 
write appropriate ads based on the website’s visitor demographics.
What do your customers want? Your benefit list can be paired with the lists ear-
lier in the chapter about what people want and what they avoid. By creating emotionally 
beneficial statements about your product, you can move past the features of a product to 
showcase how buying your product will improve someone’s life in a particular way.
Benefits, Features, and the Buying Funnel
When writing ad copy, you need to keep the buying funnel in mind (we covered the buy-
ing funnel in Chapter 2, “Performing Keyword Research”). Users have different concerns 
and questions throughout the buying funnel, and adjusting your ads appropriately can 
help engage users to click on your ads and eventually do business with your company.
The buying funnel starts with the awareness and interest phases. At this point 
in time, searchers do not know much about your products or services. Using jargon 
confuses consumers because they do not yet know enough about the products to under-
stand what the jargon means.
At this phase of the buying funnel, you need to emphasize why your products 
will make someone’s life better. Why should they want the product or want to learn 
more about your services? Using benefit-driven ad copy that tells a story of how you 
will improve their life will help to engage users.
The next step of the buying funnel is the learn phase. It is in this phase that a 
consumer’s research transitions from just understanding the benefits to also learning 

■  Dist i ngu ish i ng F e at u r e s a n d Ben ef i ts
105
about the features. Mixing both benefits and features within your ad copy is useful. 
This will help transition users to understanding why they need the product and then 
start them down the next path of the buying funnel into feature comparison.
If you do not know where a keyword lives in the buying funnel, it can be useful 
to first treat the keyword as part of the learn phase since your ad copy showcases both 
benefits and features. Once you write your initial ad copy, you should test these key-
words with different ad messages to see which resonates better with the consumer to 
determine where the keyword lives within the buying funnel. These are excellent key-
words to start some of your testing (discussed later).
In addition, often the search buying funnel starts at the learn phase. Because a 
consumer cannot search for something they have no knowledge of, the Google Display 
Network is more useful in reaching users at the top of the buying funnel (more on the 
Display Network in Chapter 9).
Once a consumer has learned more about a product and has decided they want 
to buy a product or engage a company’s services, the consumer moves into the shop-
ping comparison phase.
When someone is comparing products, they already understand why a product 
will enhance their life (which is a benefit of your product). At this stage of the buy-
ing funnel, it is important to showcase features. That’s why you often see shopping 
carts and reviews that have the ability to sort by color, size, rating, review, and so on. 
However, while you want to start emphasizing features during this phase, never forget 
benefits. Consumers eventually buy because of benefits; don’t lose sight of this fact.
It is easy for a consumer to compare products side by side to see which product 
has which feature. It is usually more beneficial for you to make a comparison chart to 
highlight your best features.
You may test some ad copy (more on testing in Chapter 15) that shows features 
and then list the benefits of those features on the landing page. Other ideas for ad copy 
are all features that tell a story about why your product is superior to the other prod-
ucts in the marketplace. You can always fall back on the standard ad copy to test one 
feature and the major benefit of that feature.
In the shopping comparison phase, you can also make an assumption that the 
consumer has a basic understanding of the jargon associated with the products. It is 
now okay to use some jargon in your ads. Price-conscious shoppers will compare both 
features and prices. When the economy is in a downturn, often you will see consumers 
buy “good enough” products that are less expensive as opposed to the “best” product 
in the market.
When to Use a Feature vs. a Benefit
Finally, it is time for the shopper to make a purchase. While we comparison shop on 
features, we buy because of benefits. When your keywords fall into the buying stage 

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
106
of the buying funnel, you should include benefits in your ad copy. These are also 
excellent ads to test. In some cases, you may find an all-benefit ad copy works best. 
In other cases, a benefit-and-feature ad copy may work best. In many industries, the 
feature may not be about the product but instead about the final cost of the product. 
Therefore, items like shipping, prices, and discounts can serve to enhance your ads.
Ad Copy Format to Start Utilizing Features and Benefits
There will be times when a keyword does not fit neatly into one phase of the buying funnel. In this 
instance, since you might be unsure of what type of ad to write, start with one of the standard ad formats:
••
Captivating headline
••
Product or service feature
••
Product or service benefit
••
Display URL
This is an excellent starting ad. It might not be the best ad in the long run, but you have to start some-
where. Once you have created this standard ad type, you can test it against other ads that focus more 
on user benefits and product features to see which ad type consumers respond to for those particular 
keywords.
While ads should be written that reflect the keywords that trigger the ad to be 
shown, the content of the ads should change based on searcher behavior and knowl-
edge. Do not just write all-benefit or all-feature ads regardless of where someone is in 
the buying funnel. Determine where someone is in their decision-making process and 
then write ads appropriate to their current mind-set.
If you are certain where the searcher is within the buying funnel, emphasize the 
benefits or features of your products; doing so can serve to increase your CTR, conver-
sion rates, and ultimately your company’s profits.
Employing Themes That Get Clicks
An ad has three lines where you can be creative: the headline and the two description 
lines. (You can be creative with display URLs, but there’s a limited amount of creativ-
ity possible.)
Headline  This is generally used to captivate the audience. The headline should draw the 
consumer’s eye so they read your two description lines. You can use the headline as a 
benefit or feature line as well; it does not always have to be a line to draw the eye.
Two Description Lines  These are your chances to show off two different aspects of your 
products or services. These description lines could be benefits, features, prices, USPs, 
and so forth.

■  Em ploy i ng T h em e s T h at Get Clicks
107
No matter how you choose to use these three lines, there exists a maximum 
number of themes or different thoughts you can include in a single ad. Themes are the 
high-level classifications of different types of ad writing styles, such as the following:
••
Ads that include prices or discounts
••
Ads focused on testimonials
••
Ads that convey information
••
Ads that include negative information
We will focus on themes with concrete examples in the next section.
Because of character restrictions, you must pick and choose which messages you 
are going to use to create these haiku-like ads to bring a searcher from viewing your ad 
to your website. If you decide to showcase two product-specific benefits, you probably 
do not have room to also talk about pricing and shipping and customer service within 
the same ad copy. There just is not enough room in these brief lines to add every mar-
keting message you desire.
You can utilize various themes in your ad copy. Each theme emphasizes a differ-
ent message. No one theme is better or worse than any other. Your goal is to test differ-
ent themes to see which one performs best for your marketing goals.
Every time you include a theme in an ad, you are also excluding another theme. 
This goes for your competition as well. Your goal is to make your ad stand out, show the 
searchers you can answer their questions, and make them desire to view your website. If 
your competition is using just one theme, you may decide to test some completely differ-
ent themes to see if that can make your ad stand apart from the other text on a page.
Utilizing Numbers in Ads
You can use psychology to help determine how searchers view different types of ads. 
You will see two prevalent themes when utilizing numbers in your ads: number ranges 
and exact numbers.
People often focus on the number that is most beneficial to their current situ-
ation. In ad copy writing, you can use this type of psychology to test single numbers 
versus ranges for numbers in your ad copy (Figure 4.5).
Figure 4.5  Prices in ad copy

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
108
Among these three ads, there is already a probable loser you can spot logically 
even before you start testing. The first ad says up to $199. $199 is more than $89 or 
$99, and it is therefore the worst ad in many cases. If the third ad were from $99 and 
up (so the same price as the middle ad), then the middle ad would usually be the win-
ner. While it says “from $99,” it does not explicitly state that more expensive products 
are available.
There will be times when the competition’s prices are similar or you do not 
want to include the actual price in the ad—you may want to showcase a discount offer 
instead of an actual price point. You can apply the same principles of using numerals in 
ad copy to discount ranges (Figure 4.6).
Figure 4.6  Discounts in ad copy
In these two ads, there is also a winner in the majority of tests. The first ad copy 
states 25 percent off. The second one states 25–60 percent off. Sixty percent is bigger 
than 25 percent, so usually the 60 percent off ad will get the higher CTR. The mer-
chant might have only one item at 60 percent off and the others all at 25 percent off. 
That doesn’t matter. Bigger is usually better as far as CTRs go.
With discounts, your conversion rate will often go up along with the CTR. 
However, you will also make less per sale than without a discount. Therefore, you need 
to perform another level of math to determine the effectiveness of any discounts you 
might offer.
For instance, take a look at Table 4.2 and determine your best discount point to 
maximize profits. The clicks are varied in the table because often adding a discount to 
the ad copy will increase the CTR.

The return on ad spend (ROAS) in Table 4.2 is as follows:
((Conversions × Average Order Value × (1-Discount)) – Spend)
In this case, Offer B with a lower discount and a slight bump in conversion rates 
creates a better return than D, which has a larger increase in conversion rates and CTR 
but also utilizes a much steeper discount. Bigger isn’t always better.
If one of your goals is to get the most customers possible because you have a nice 
lifetime visitor value program, then offer D might be best overall. In that case, do not 
use your average order value in the match—use your lifetime visitor value instead.
In e-commerce scenarios, sometimes you will also see your average order value 
change with discounts (see Table 4.3).
In Table 4.3, Offer D with the large discount would be best on both a profit and 
customer basis. However, just by building a simple spreadsheet—one that lists your 
discounts and offers some projections about how much higher your conversion rate 
would have to be in order to make up the sale discounts in your total profits—you can 
start to visualize what type of impact your ad copy discounts and landing page offers 
have to have on both CTR and conversion rates in order to be successful.

The last number to try in ad copy is a very exact number: “I saved $241.56 last 
year by using Tax Software.” These exact numbers draw consumers’ eyes because they 
do not look like standard pricing and discount numbers. Using exact numbers in ad 
copy is best in the following cases:
••
Your ad shows how much of something you can save someone:
••
Learn how I saved 37 hours using the Getting Things Done methodology for 
managing my email.
••
Our IT department cut costs by $238,021 by instituting Google Apps for 
domains.
••
Our customers can lose 26.5 lbs in just 3 months.
••
Reduce your calorie intake by 354 calories a day.

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■

••
Your ad shows how much money you made:
••
Learn how I made $328,282 selling real estate.
••
Our staffing agency increased salaries by $23,055.
Using prices and discounts in ad copy is useful to test in these situations:
••
Consumers are very price conscious.
••
You are advertising in highly competitive product industries.
••
There are large price ranges for the same type of products.
••
You are using shopping comparison keywords.
••
You are the lowest-cost producer, and that is your advantage.
There are times when you might have an opportunity to change the pricing 
rules. If a customer sees two ads with the prices $10 and $50, usually they will assume 
these two products are quite different even if they are the same. If you were to create 
an ad with a $40 price point, then the $10 ad looks cheap, and the $50 and $40 ads 
look similar. In this case, the $40 price point might win out. However, in that same 
scenario, if you were to create an ad that listed a $15 price point (so the ads would be 
$10, $15, and $50), the $50 looks quite expensive and the $10 ad might turn out to be 
the winner.
Two price points do not give consumers a good comparison if there is a signifi-
cant difference in prices. Three prices on a page are enough data points that consumers 
can start to compare products from just the ad copy.
You should always take into consideration your competitors’ ads. If all of your 
competitors are using prices in their ads, you may want to test an ad that showcases 
features and benefits of the product instead of pricing. This is especially true in indus-
tries where everyone is trying to showcase the lowest price. If you lower your price to 
a point where you no longer make money on the sale, then why buy that keyword? 
In those cases, you may want to forgo showing a price at all and instead focus on the 
other customer benefits.
How Strong Is Your Call to Action?
A call to action is a statement in your ad copy that informs customers what you want 
them to do once they arrive at your website. Some calls to action are straightforward:
••
Subscribe to our newsletter.
••
Call for an appointment.
••
Buy a new TV today!
You can mix and match ad types and lines. You could have a call to action that 
is also a benefit. You can use a USP that is also a company feature.
Consider the ads shown in Figure 4.7. Which one would you click?

■  Em ploy i ng T h em e s T h at Get Clicks
111
Figure 4.7  Different calls to action
“Signup for our newsletter today!” is a generic call to action. It does not add any 
additional benefit for the searcher.
“Receive Your Secrets Today!” is not necessarily a call to action. It is showcas-
ing a benefit to the customer. When these three ads were run in a test, this one did 
receive the highest CTR of the three ad types. That often has to do with the words free 
and secret. Secret is an interesting word to use in ad copy because it makes people feel 
included in a little-known club. However, this ad did not have the highest conversion 
rate of the three ads.
“Signup for Powerful Marketing Tips” had the second-highest CTR but the 
highest conversion rate, and when you combine the actual numbers, this ad was 
the most profitable of the three. This line still includes a call to action but also tells 
consumers they are going to receive “powerful tips.” Who does not want powerful 
information?
In this example, there are many other calls to action you could test:
••
Using the word inbox reminds consumers it will go to their email.
••
The word inbox could also be associated with spam, so showcasing multiple 
delivery options, such as RSS feeds, could be tested.
••
Using the word daily or weekly would let someone know how often they would 
see this information.
••
Is powerful overused? Try different adjectives such as effective or persuasive. A 
thesaurus is one bookmark that should always be at your fingertips.
Once you find an effective message, it does not mean your job is complete. It 
means you have a nice starting place from which you can continue to refine your ads 
and increase your profits.
Writing Informational Ad Copy
The reason someone uses a search engine is to find the answer to a question. That 
answer is a piece of information. Showcasing informational statements in ad copy 
(Figure 4.8) can be a useful way to connect with the searcher.

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
112
Figure 4.8  Informational ad copy
These informational ads can also showcase pieces of information that might 
not be part of the product but, when included with the product, help increase its 
usefulness.
How much exercise equipment is bought, used for a month, relegated to the 
garage for the next six months, and put up for sale on eBay the following year? Since 
this is a common aspect of buying exercise equipment, including bonus information 
that showcases ways to help someone continue to use a treadmill could be highly 
effective.
When people are buying headsets, some of the biggest consumer questions 
revolve around clarity, background noise, and volume. By addressing one of the impor-
tant issues about a product within the ad copy, you show not only that you sell the 
product but that a searcher can also learn about the products on your site.
Examine the top questions, issues, complaints, and user behaviors that exist 
with your services. What additional information can you include in the ad copy that 
helps a consumer make a decision on which product to buy?
Reflecting the Consumer’s Question
You have a question to which you would like to know the answer. Therefore, you go to 
a search engine to find that answer. If you see an ad that reflects your original question, 
it is easy to assume that website has relevant information to help you find the informa-
tion you seek.
It is worthwhile testing questions in ad copy. Since your ad will be reflecting the 
reason why someone originally went to a search engine and the question that user is 
currently trying to answer, you may see some nice increases in CTR by utilizing ques-
tions in your ad copy (Figure 4.9).
When writing questions in ads, it is more important to have the question mark 
(?) in the ad copy than to write a properly structured sentence. By just adding the ques-
tion mark to your current headline, you may see a difference in CTR, and searchers will 
automatically add the understood “Are you…” to the ad copy with the question mark.

Figure 4.9  Questions in ad copy
Including Testimonials or Reviews in Ad Copy
Often we sit isolated behind a computer when making online purchasing decisions, 
without another person to ask what they think about a product. We understand that 
we are not experts in every field. Therefore, reading testimonials others have left, or 
expert reviews about a product, can help us feel more confident in making a decision 
(Figure 4.10).
Figure 4.10  Ad copy testimonials and reviews
The actual testimonial or review does not have to be included in the ad copy, 
although a short review can be useful. Your ad copy just needs to let the consumer 
know that upon visiting your site, they can read the opinions of others.
The actual testimonial information can even change based on the buying funnel. 
If someone is in the comparison shopping phase, they are most likely looking for prod-
uct reviews. However, if someone has decided on the actual product and they are now 
looking for which site they are going to buy the product from, testimonials about your 
company could be more useful.
Expert reviews about different types of products (LED versus plasma TVs) are 
more aligned with the buying funnel if the consumer is in the learn phase.
Even with different ad themes, these various types of ads should consider which 
phase of the buying funnel the consumer is in to ensure your ad is resonating with the 
searcher.

Utilizing Negative Ad Copy
When you read the newspaper, view TV headlines, or watch political campaigns, a 
common theme emerges: negative information.
Negative information stops many people from looking elsewhere and immedi-
ately draws their attention. If you consider what people want and don’t want (the lists 
earlier in this chapter), often negative information reflects those types of conditions. 
Many people are drawn to negative information. This includes search ads (Figure 4.11).
Figure 4.11  Negative information  
advertisements
Although negative ads often stand out in a search result, especially if none of 
the other ads is negative, it is important to consider your company positioning before 
utilizing negative ads. Negative ads are read by consumers. Not only does your ad copy 
contain your website’s URL, but it also directs consumers to your website. The infor-
mation contained within an ad is a reflection of your company. Therefore, before run-
ning a negative ad, please make sure that it is in line with your company positioning:
••
If your company wants to be known as a friendly company, you may not want to 
run negative ads.
••
If your company is about consumer warnings and recalled product information, 
for example, then negative ads may be in line with your company’s image.
If you are an agency or part of a marketing department within a larger company, 
before creating and testing negative ads, first check with the CEO or the department 
that runs brand management and company positioning to make sure that negative ads 
are okay to run and test.
Do Not Forget the Display URL
The display URL tells consumers where they are going after they click. However, the 
display URL can also help signal a user where on the site they will be directed.
Google has more than 6 million pages indexed from IBM.com. Knowing you are 
going to IBM.com is not necessarily useful. If the display URL is IBM.com/BladeServer, 

■  Em ploy i ng T h em e s T h at Get Clicks
115
suddenly you know that you are not just going to one of the 6 million pages on IBM.com, 
but that you will end up on a page about blade servers. If you are in the market for a new 
server, that is a much more useful page than the homepage of IBM.com.
Google has two important editorial rules you must follow in regard to display 
and destination URLs:
••
The display URL must be the site where the user ends up. In other words, if 
you were Dell, you could not have IBM.com as your display URL and then direct 
someone to Dell.com.
••
All of the destination URLs within an ad group must go to the same website. In 
other words, you could not have one ad that goes to IBM.com and a second ad 
within the same ad group that goes to Dell.com.
Google automatically lowercases the display URLs in text ads; therefore, even if 
you capitalize the letters in your ad copy within the Google interface, it will not be dis-
played that way on a search result:
••
commentsexchange.com
••
CommentSexChange.com
••
CommentsExchange.com
However, Google does capitalize the characters after a slash in the display URL. 
In this case, you might want to pick a different site to use with AdWords since it will 
be difficult to overcome the various ways in which the URL can be interpreted.
This concept extends not to just single words within a display URL but to other 
ways of interpreting your URL. Always take a look at your URL to see how many ways 
it can be interpreted.
With the display URL, that exact URL does not have to exist within your web-
site. It also does not have to be the same as the destination URL. The root domain 
must be the same for your destination and display URLs, but the URLs themselves do 
not have to be the same. For instance, you could have the following display and desti-
nation URLs:
••
Display URL: CertifiedKnowledge.org/Seminars
••
Destination URL: http://certifiedknowledge.org/adwords-seminars/
In this case, the root domain, CertifiedKnowledge.org, is the same for both 
URLs and therefore the ad would be approved.
You need to be careful of using spaces in display URLs. In the headline, descrip-
tion line 1 and description line 2, a space is rendered in the browser as a space. For the 
display URL, a space is rendered how a browser renders a space. For instance, Firefox 
uses a plus sign for a space, so if you had a URL such as CertifiedKnowledge.org/adwords 
seminars, that URL would be rendered as certifiedknowledge.org/adwords+seminars.

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
116
The two most common display URLs are either the root domain of the website 
or a folder containing the product name. However, there are other ways to write dis-
play URLs (Figure 4.12).
Figure 4.12  Display URLs
If you have a narrow theme site, just including the domain name and no addi-
tional information can be useful. If a searcher sees AdWords.com and is familiar with 
AdWords, this domain name signals they will arrive at the AdWords program’s web-
site. No additional information is necessary in that case.
Adding a folder, such as /ProductInfo, can help you show a user where on the 
website they will arrive. Folders are useful to test on larger websites.
However, when you add a folder, it does not just have to be about the product 
or service. You can also create synergies with the ad copy that reinforce the ad’s mes-
sage. In the examples in Figure 4.12, the ads speak to comparing headsets. Therefore, 
using /Compare in the display URL reinforces to the user that they will arrive at a site 
that is comparing products. If someone is comparison-shopping products, this synergy 
of reinforcing the ad copy can help your company attract the searcher’s click. If you are 
advertising locally, often including a state or city name in the display URL shows that 
you really are local and can increase your overall CTRs.
The display URL is a line of ad copy. Since you have only four lines that you can 
control, do not forget to test this particular line of ad copy. The display URL CTR is 
also a Quality Score factor (more about Quality Score in later chapters). Testing display 
URLs is useful not just to examine click-through and conversion rates but also to test 
for ways to improve your overall Quality Score.
Controlling Your Mobile Ads
In the summer of 2013, Google rolled out a large change to AdWords. Among many 
changes, one of the major ones was how ads were controlled among device types. 
Previous to this change, known as Enhanced Campaigns, ads were used on all devices 

■  Con t rolli ng You r Mobi le A ds
117
based on the campaign’s settings. Now an ad can be designated as to whether it will be 
used on a mobile device (Figure 4.13), and search campaigns can no longer be desig-
nated as mobile-, desktop-, or tablet-only campaigns.
Figure 4.13  Mobile-preferred ads
If you have two ads in your ad group and one is mobile preferred and the other 
is not mobile preferred, then you can control which ad is displayed on which device. If 
you only use non-mobile-preferred ads, then your ads that are built for desktops will 
show on mobile devices. If your ad group contains only mobile-preferred ads, then 
your mobile-preferred ads will show on desktops. To control which ad is shown on a 
desktop versus a mobile device, you must have at least one mobile-preferred ad and one 
non-mobile-preferred ad.
It is common to see different ad elements perform differently by device. Table 4.4 
shows a sample CTR test for the same ad elements used across multiple devices.

As you can see, some ad elements such as “Call Us” perform much better on 
a phone than on a desktop, whereas other lines such as “Shop Now” do better on a 
desktop than on a phone. If you are advertising on multiple device types, then you will 
want to control your ads and ad testing by device.
There are other settings within AdWords that use the mobile-preferred designa-
tion; one of them is ad extensions. If an ad extension is marked as mobile preferred, 
then that extension will be used on mobile devices. If it is not marked as mobile pre-
ferred, then it can be used on all devices.

Spicing Up Your Ads with Ad Extensions
Ad extensions allow you to append additional information to your text ads. Not only 
do these extensions help your ads stand out from other ads on the page, but they can 
also direct visitors into different sections of your site or even perform actions on the 
search page. All of your text ads should be using ad extensions.
To create new extensions, navigate to the Ad Extensions tab (Figure 4.14) and 
create a new extension.
Figure 4.14  Ad Extensions tab
Some of the extensions are at the campaign level, meaning they apply to every 
single ad group within.
Some of the extensions are associated at the campaign level, which means they 
apply to every single ad group in that campaign. Other extensions can be associated at 
both the campaign and/or ad group level, meaning the extension can be overwritten at 
just the ad group level if it exists at the campaign level, or the extension can exist only 
for specific ad groups.
If an extension exists at both the campaign and ad group levels, then the ad 
group level one will be used with your ad. If an ad group level one does not exist, then 
the campaign-level extension will be used.
If you want to use the same extension across multiple campaigns or use the same 
extension in multiple ad groups, you will have to create the extension multiple times. A 
campaign can have multiple extension types associated with it.
Sitelink Extensions
Sitelink extensions, or as we call them more simply, sitelinks, allow you to add addi-
tional links to your ad. When that ad is displayed above the organic results, these 
­additional links can be added to your ads (Figure 4.15).

■  Spici ng U p You r A ds w i t h A d Ex t ensions
119
Figure 4.15  Sitelink example for Hilton Hotels
To create sitelinks, navigate to the Ad Extensions tab and choose to create 
a new sitelink extension. You can add several links that will appear with your ad 
(Figure 4.16).
Figure 4.16  Adding sitelinks to your account
When you create a sitelink, you have several options:
••
Link Text: This is the text that will show up in the ad. It is limited to 25 
characters.
••
Link URL: This is the destination URL for that sitelink.
••
Device Preference: Mobile or Non-mobile.
••
Description: This is additional text that may show underneath the sitelink on 
occasion.
••
Start/End Dates: You can optionally create dates for when you want the site link 
active. This is useful for short-time promotions.
••
Scheduling: The hours or days of the week that you want the sitelink to be 
active.

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
120
Once you create several sitelinks, then you can choose which ones will be used 
in each campaign or ad group (Figure 4.17).
Figure 4.17  Adding sitelinks to a campaign
Please note that all the destination URLs in a sitelink must go to different pages 
on your website. While you can create multiple sitelinks that go to the same page, 
which you might do to use different descriptive text in various ad groups or cam-
paigns, when you bundle them together and choose which of your links will actually 
be used, they must all have different destination URLs. Since you can have both ad 
group– and campaign-level sitelinks, it is not uncommon to use the same destination 
URL with different descriptive text in multiple sitelinks and then change how they are 
bundled together at the ad group level so that the most useful descriptive text is used 
for your ads.
When you first examine your sitelink metrics, they often appear to have very 
nice metrics if your ads have high CTRs (Figure 4.18).
Figure 4.18  Sitelink statistics

■  Spici ng U p You r A ds w i t h A d Ex t ensions
121
To see the real details of your sitelink clicks versus other ad click components 
(such as directions, headlines, and calls), you must first click the segment button and 
then segment by “click type.” Once that is done, you can see the real CTR and metrics 
of your sitelinks (Figure 4.19).
Figure 4.19  Viewing sitelink click type statistics
We will cover reporting and extracting data from Google in much more detail in 
Chapter 16; however, for all of your ad extensions, segmenting the data by click type 
can give you a better picture of their metrics.
Since each sitelink must go to a different URL, this is your chance to have mul-
tiple destination URLs for a single ad. Therefore, when creating sitelinks, you should 
start to think about your overall messaging to determine where you want to send the 
additional traffic on your site.
If you have various goals across your account—for instance, you have both ROI 
and sales goals and you have a newsletter subscription goal—adding sitelinks that help 
you reach these additional goals is a good idea. If you have sales pages, pages you wish 
more people knew about, or special messaging you want to test, direct one or more of 
your sitelinks to these pages to see how they perform.
Sitelink Case Studies
Every account should be using sitelinks for all of its search campaigns. Sitelinks help 
increase CTR and often conversion rates and give you not only a chance to take up 
more real estate in a search result but also the option to put multiple messages into a 
single ad.
The big question with sitelinks is whether you should create them only at the 
campaign level or tailor them to your ads in every single ad group you have as well. 

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
122
Creating sitelinks for every ad group can take a tremendous amount of time, so before 
creating them for my accounts, I did several tests to see how they would affect the 
accounts before rolling out sitelinks to every ad group.
To create this case study, I used nine different e-commerce accounts that totaled 
roughly $1 million in monthly spend.
The ad groups were then segmented into three different areas. The first was low-
cost or low-value items. The sitelinks in these ad groups were focused on cross-selling 
items with a similar item value.
The second type of sitelinks was created for high-cost or high-value items. These 
sitelinks were focused on upsells with a maximum upsell of 60 percent of the item’s 
base cost. For example, if the search query was Men’s Suits, the sitelinks would be for 
items like ties, dress shoes, dress shirts, and so on.
The last type of sitelinks was for ambiguous queries, such as women’s dresses. 
In the case of a query like this, you have no idea if the searcher wants a prom dress, 
wedding dress, cocktail dress, evening dress, summer dress, and so on. Therefore, these 
sitelinks were focused on specific items (such as summer dress).
In these charts, Ad Group refers to the ad group sitelink metrics and Campaign 
refers to the campaign-level metrics that were average just before and after the tests 
were run. Since it is impossible to run a true A/B split test for this data, this is as close 
as you can get to a true test with sitelinks.
For the low-value items, the changes to CTR and conversion rates were negli-
gible. There was a slight change to the average order value (Figure 4.20).

Because ad group–level sitelinks can take a lot of work, the overall results tell 
you it is probably not worth it if you have to create all the sitelinks by hand. If you 
have easy access to data exports of your website where you can export data created 
by your own CMS system or CMS add-ons, such as if this was bought, this was also 
purchased (cross-sell and upsell information), then you can manipulate the informa-
tion in a spreadsheet program and use the AdWords Editor to move the data into your 

■  Spici ng U p You r A ds w i t h A d Ex t ensions
123
account. If you do not have easy access to this type of data, then in most cases it is best 
to just use campaign-level sitelinks for these types of products.
For the second group, high-value items, there was a slight increase in both 
CTR and conversion rates. However, there was also a decrease in average order value 
(Figure 4.21).

Figure 4.21  Sitelink test for high-value items
The reason for the decrease in average order value is that most of the increase in 
conversions was for the upsell item and not the item that was searched. In other words, 
someone searched for a suit and saw a sitelink for a pair of dress shoes and bought 
only the lower-cost shoes and not the entire suit. However, the total number of new 
conversions made the use of these sitelinks more profitable than using either no site-
links or only generic campaign-level ones. For your top-value items, running a test for 
yourself is a worthwhile experiment.
For the ambiguous queries, the results were very positive. Both the CTR and 
conversion rates increased in all five tests I conducted (Figure 4.22).
The average order value does fluctuate for many of the tests. The change in aver-
age order value is mostly due to seasonality and not because of the sitelink usage. For 
instance, summer dresses are less expensive than cocktail dresses. So tests for dresses

The same can be said of shoes; dress shoes are more expensive than flip-flops. 
The usage of sitelinks on these queries is very positive overall, and it’s worth creating 
them at the ad group level.
Sitelinks are displayed only when the ads are shown in the top premium posi-
tions. If your ads are shown only on the side of the page, then the sitelinks are not 
used. So, if you want to prioritize where to start testing out ad group–level sitelinks, 
you will want to look for ad groups that have most of their impressions in the top posi-
tions. You can see this data (Figure 4.23) by navigating to your ad group tab and then 
using the segment feature to segment by Top vs. Other.

Since sitelinks allow you to control multiple destination URLs within an ad, take 
up more real estate in a search results, and can be customized at the campaign or ad 
group level, every account should be using them. There are many other extensions you 
can use beyond sitelinks that are based more around the type of actions you want a 
user to take when interacting with your ads.
Call Extensions
Call extensions add your phone number to ads when shown on desktop computers. 
When they are displayed on mobile devices, the number is also clickable and can initi-
ate a click-to-call scenario. If your primary goal is phone calls, you should use the call 
extension.
To enable the call extension, go to the Ad Extensions tab and create a new 
extension (Figure 4.24).
Figure 4.24  Choose all ads or mobile only for call extensions.
There are several decisions you need to make when creating a call extension. 
The first is the phone number. Input the phone number where you want the call to 
ring. If you are using a third-party call-tracking system, you can also input their 
trackable phone number so that you can know exactly how many calls are occurring 
from your ads.
The next option is whether you want to use a Google forwarding number or 
your own number. If you have a phone number that you are branding using TV or 

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
126
radio commercials, then you will often want to use that number from a consistency 
standpoint. However, if you use your own number, then you cannot use Google’s call-
tracking information to determine what clicks are leading to phone calls. If you use a 
Google forwarding number, then you can see additional metrics inside your account.
An issue that companies sometimes run into when using a call-tracking number 
in the call extension and Google’s forwarding number at the same time is that a user 
will be transferred twice before your phone actually rings. The first transfer is Google 
forwarding the call to your call-tracking number, and the second transfer is from the 
call-tracking number to your own number. Depending on the speed of the transfers, 
the user might hear two or three rings before your phone rings once. In these cases, 
you will want to answer the phone quickly before the user hangs up.
Beyond the phone number, you can also track calls as conversions if you are 
using a Google forwarding number. You can enable the check box and then list the 
minimum duration of the call before it is counted as a conversion.
When someone clicks on your phone number on a mobile phone, a click is actu-
ally just the phone dialer loading. So if you are not using Google’s call tracking or your 
own call-tracking system, you will never know how many actual calls you received 
from those clicks. Using a method of tracking calls will give you much better insight 
into the actual number of calls you are receiving.
The one caution I will offer when selecting a duration time is that you should 
determine the length of a quality call. I know of plenty of sites that can have 60- to 
90-second calls and end up with a new customer. Often advertisers see a 60-second 
call and think it was so short it could not have been a quality call. Measure a few calls 
that come into your office and see how long a call has to be before you can book a new 
patient, take a reservation, or give someone directions to your store, and then choose a 
duration for your call conversions.
Next, there is the ambiguous notation of Show The Following Links. This set-
ting is applicable only when your extension is shown on a mobile device that is capable 
of making calls. If you choose Both My Website And The Phone Number, then if some-
one clicks the headline of the ad, they will go to the destination URL used in your ad. 
If the user clicks the Call button (Figure 4.25) that appears in the extension, then you 
are charged a click price and the phone’s dialer will load.
Then you have the device preference check. You can have both mobile and desk-
top call extensions. As with sitelinks, you have the ability to create start and end dates. 
And then finally, you can set a schedule for when you want the extension to run. If you 
answer your phone only from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., you will want to run your extension 
only during those same hours.
You can have call extensions at the ad group or campaign level. If you have some 
ad groups where the keywords are support focused and other ad groups where the key-
words are sales focused, then you can have one extension that rings to a sales line and 
another one to a support line.

Figure 4.25  Call extension on a mobile device
If you are a business that relies on calls, you should be using the call extension; 
it is very effective at generating calls, especially on mobile devices.
Additional Extensions
The most used extensions are sitelinks, calls, and location extensions (covered in 
Chapter 11, “Utilizing Advanced Geographic Targeting Techniques”); however, there 
are others you should be aware of so you can use them when they are appropriate to 
your account.
Seller Ratings Extension  With the ratings extension, if you receive a certain number of rat-
ings on sites that Google trusts, and you average 3.5 stars or better, then you can have 
stars shown next to your ads (Figure 4.26).
Figure 4.26  REI seller ratings extension showing stars

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
128
You cannot force this extension to show. If you are an e-commerce site, go to Google 
Shopping, look at where your competitors are getting reviews, and then get reviews on 
those same sites. For local companies, reviews can also show up, and these are often 
taken from reputable local sources, such as Google Local or Google Plus.
Social Extension  The social extension shows how many people are following your brand’s 
page on Google Plus. To use this extension, you must first create a Google Plus page 
and then connect it to your AdWords account.
Review Extension  The review extension shows a third-party review within your ad 
(Figure 4.27). The review must appear on a credible third-party site. You can then put 
a snippet of the review within your ad. Google does review these reviews closely, so 
after you submit the extension, you will want to keep checking to see if it is approved 
or not.
Figure 4.27  Review extension showing snippet from a user review
App Extension  The app extension is exclusively for companies that offer smartphone 
applications. With this extension, you can feature your app on the devices in which 
your app can be installed.
These are the main extensions available today. Most businesses should be using 
sitelinks at a minimum, but a good ad can contain several extensions at the same time. 
Take this ad from REI (Figure 4.28). It includes seller ratings, sitelinks, a location 
extension, and a social extension all within one ad.
Figure 4.28  REI ad utilizing multiple extensions
Pick at least one and possibly three to four different extensions to include with 
your ads. By using ad extensions, you will often see higher CTRs and conversion rates 
because your ad can convey more information to the searcher about your products and 
services.

Limited Betas for New Extensions
Until recently, Google would enhance AdWords by introducing new types of ads. 
Local business ads were a prime example. Unfortunately, as they introduced more and 
more functionality and ad types, each with different formatting and unique attributes, 
it became more and more complex for advertisers and Google alike to support and 
optimize.
Now, instead of creating whole new families of ads, Google seems to have set-
tled on rolling out ad extensions to accomplish the same goal: adding new features into 
the AdWords marketplace. With ad extensions, you write a typical text ad as normal, 
and then information gets appended to the ad—which means the ads are consistent 
and Google can easily scale the number of extensions that exist. Whenever Google is 
testing new ad extensions, they make them available to small subsets of advertisers in 
pre-release beta tests. There seem to be new ones announced every other day, and as 
of this writing, they are allowing advertisers to play with images, contact, and leads 
extensions.
Some of these betas will be proven successful and eventually become open to 
all, and some will not be so successful and will be retired or sent back to the drawing 
board. If you have a Google rep, it is useful to discuss the beta extensions with them to 
see if there is a type that fits your business model.
Showcasing Your Products with PLAs
Google has reduced the number of ad formats that can be used across search to two 
main ones. The first is text, which is most of what has been discussed in this chap-
ter. The second is known as product listing ads (PLAs). These are image-based ads 
(Figure 4.29) that show in the search results.
Figure 4.29  Product listing ad examples
These ads are purely for e-commerce companies because they feature products 
from Google Merchant Center. We could spend over a hundred pages talking about 
feed optimization and PLA organization. Since we do not have time to cover all of that 

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
130
information, we will cover the basic information about what you need to know to cre-
ate and have PLAs show from your account.
To create product listing ads, you must first have a Google Merchant Center 
account. Once this account is open, you need to populate it with products. The easiest 
way to do this is from a shopping cart export. Most shopping carts have feed exports 
that can be uploaded to a Merchant Center account.
With PLAs, you do not choose keywords. Google chooses what queries your 
ads will be displayed on based on the information in your feed. Therefore, it is in your 
best interest to use all of the possible fields within the feed. The feed is your proxy to 
keywords, so if your feed is missing a lot of optional information, your PLAs will not 
show often. A minimum number of fields is required, and if you do not include this 
information, then your feed will be rejected and no PLAs will show from your account.
Once you have an approved feed, you need to apply that feed to your account 
and start creating ad groups from the Auto Targets tab (Figure 4.30) inside your 
account.
Figure 4.30  Auto targets for PLAs
The most basic setup is to create an All Products category. This will enable 
Google to show any product from your feed for any search query that Google deems 
is relevant to your offers. While this is a very easy setup, it gives you almost no control 
over bidding for your products because you will not have the ability to set a bid for 
each product.
Therefore, just like organizing keywords into small, granular ad groups, you 
should do the same exercise with your feed. You can do this by choosing various tar-
gets within your AdWords account (Figure 4.31). Usually you will want one target or 
target group per ad group.
While many companies suggest using one SKU or product per ad group, this 
management can become very difficult to sustain if you have a large variety of prod-
ucts. Given that almost half of all PLA clicks that result in a sale are for a different 
product than what was shown in the ad, going to that level of organization can be 
overly burdensome.

131
Figure 4.31  Choosing auto targets
Although you might create single product ad groups for your top products, in 
general, it is okay to group closely related (and closely priced) products together within 
an ad group. The easiest way to do this is by using one of two optional fields in the 
product feed: AdWords Grouping or AdWords Labels. If you first examine your prod-
ucts and feeds, then you can add labels to the fields that will correspond to your final 
ad groups. Once you have the data in the feed, then you will want to create one ad 
group for each label or grouping target that you are using so you can control the bid-
ding for each of those groups.
With PLAs, you can write only a single line of ad copy that goes along with the 
ad. Usually the ads contain either information about the product or information about 
shipping, such as Free Shipping On Orders Over $35.
If you are an e-commerce company, then you should use product listing ads. The 
real trick to making PLAs successful is to first spend time on making sure that your 
entire feed is complete and accurate and that you are taking advantage of the optional 
fields. The second part of PLA optimization is to create granular ad groups for pur-
poses of bidding. If you have products that range from $5 to $500, there is no way to 
set a single ad group bid that covers that price range; thus, you will want to group your 
products based on price, margins, and relation to each other. And then finally you can 
do some ad testing for PLAs to see what offers bring you the most orders.
Following the Law: Trademarks
Google’s trademark policy has been evolving over the past few years as the trademark 
laws and online advertising have become more settled. Though trademark law and 
Google’s policies vary somewhat by region and country, Google’s approach to trade-
marks in advertising has become pretty clear.

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
132
There are two areas where advertisers typically are concerned about trademark 
use: the trademarked keywords you add into your account and the use of trademarked 
terms in ad text.
Google’s keyword policy is very simple. In most countries, they will not investi-
gate or restrict the use of trademarks in your keyword inventory. Advertisers are free to 
choose whatever keywords they want to add into their account, regardless of whether 
they are trademarked by some other company.
However, Google restricts the use of trademarked terms in ad copy worldwide. 
If a competitor is using your trademarks in their headlines, descriptions, or extensions, 
you can request that Google stop showing those ads, and with a few exceptions they 
will take those ads offline.
Advertisers can protect their trademarks from being used in ads by filing com-
plaints with Google. In some regions, they may also restrict ads from showing if the 
combination of the ad and the keyword is confusing or misleading to consumers. The 
full list of editorial policies appears here:
https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6118
If you are a trademark holder and want to protect your trademark from being 
used in competitive ads, you can file a complaint online with Google using the form 
available here:
https://services.google.com/inquiry/aw_tmcomplaint
You can file a complaint against a specific advertiser or against all advertisers 
(generally competitors within your industry) to prevent your trademarks from being 
used by competitors (Figure 4.32).
Figure 4.32  Filing for general or specific trademark protection
“Within the same industry” is an important caveat when it comes to trade-
marks. For example, there are over 3,000 records at the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office (www.uspto.gov) for the search word apple in their database. While the word 
apple is trademarked in many industries, an orchard farmer can use the word apple 
in his ad copy. If you submit an ad and a form pops up that tells you a word is trade-
marked but it is not trademarked for your industry, just put that information on the 
exception request form (“not trademarked for my industry”).

■  Follow i ng t h e L aw: T r a dem a r ks
133
Note:  Since trademarks are held at the country level, it is also important to consider in which countries your 
campaign will be displayed. If you choose to have your campaign shown to two different countries that each have 
different trademark laws, your ads and keywords will then have to follow the laws of both countries. There are 
many reasons to limit your campaigns to show in only one country, and one of them is based on trademark laws.
There are a few different ways that brands can think about their trademark uti-
lization within ad copy. Let’s walk through a few scenarios that show why a company 
may have various feelings about the enforcement of their trademarks. I will use Nike in 
this example since they sell both directly and through other outlet channels. However, 
please note that this may not be Nike’s current policy.
Many stores sell Nike shoes. Regardless of whether a consumer buys shoes from 
Nike.com, Zappos.com, or yet another store that sells Nike shoes, Nike will sell a pair 
of shoes. Therefore, they might not file a trademark complaint with Google and will 
allow other companies to use the Nike trademark in ad copy, because Nike can gain 
additional sales through their distribution partners.
Nike could take another approach and decide to selectively give accounts per-
mission to use their trademark. They may decide that they have a special relationship 
with certain retailers and allow only those retailers to use the Nike trademark in ad 
copy. In that case, Nike can list authorized entities on the trademark complaint by 
providing Google with the AdWords account ID and other information for the adver-
tisers they will grant permission to use their trademarks. This practice is common in 
franchise companies. If the corporate office holds the trademark, they may want their 
actual franchises to be allowed to use the trademark. This means the corporate office 
would need the AdWords account ID numbers for each franchisee account. However, 
you cannot selectively give permission until Google has completed their initial trade-
mark investigation.
The most restrictive approach Nike could take is to not allow anyone but Nike.
com to use their trademarks. Nike could decide that since they sell shoes online, they 
do not want additional competition for their trademarked words. In this instance, in 
the United States, consumers could see a wide variety of ads on a search for the word 
Nike, but only the Nike.com ad would actually display the word Nike.
Currently, Nike has not taken a restrictive approach. I’m not attempting to call 
out Nike specifically but to walk you through the conversations that should occur 
within your organization about the use of trademarks.
In addition, just because Google may allow you to use a trademark in your ad 
copy does not mean the trademark holder could not sue you anyway. While Google’s 
editorial policies may be introduced into the court case, a company can sue another 
company regardless of Google’s policies.

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
134
This is especially true of company names. In these cases, there is a good reason 
for other companies to use Nike’s trademarks in ad copy. However, if you use a com-
petitor’s name in your ad copy, regardless of the word being trademarked, you could 
end up in a lawsuit. A competitor could also sue you for using their name as a keyword 
even if it does not appear in the ad copy. Your competitor may or may not win, but you 
will still have to pay to defend your keyword usage.
It is a worthwhile exercise to sit down with your marketing and legal depart-
ments to create rules about your use of trademarks and competitors’ names. If you use 
a third party to manage your AdWords account, make sure that party understands 
your policies on these items.
Trademark Exceptions
In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, Google will allow the 
use of trademarks in ad copy—even if the company has filed a trademark complaint—
as long as you meet certain conditions, such as these:
••
You sell a product corresponding to the trademarked term.
••
You fix a product corresponding to the trademarked term.
••
You are an information site corresponding to the trademarked term.
To be approved for use of a trademark in the ad copy, your landing page must 
be about that trademark. You will not be allowed to use “Dell computers” in your ad 
copy and send the visitor to a page that sells Apple computers.
Google will take a look at your ads, keywords, and landing pages, and if you 
meet the criteria, Google will approve the ads on a limited basis (Figure 4.33).
Figure 4.33  Limited ad approval status
These ads will not go live on non-Google-owned properties. Therefore, you will 
want to create another ad in the ad group that can go live on search partner sites.

135
Interestingly, one additional exception to the visible use of trademarks in ads is 
the display URL. Google does not examine or act on any complaints where the trade-
mark appears in the display or destination URLs. So for example, if you are selling 
against Acme Widgets, and you don’t have their permission to use their trademark, you 
could use this display URL without any restriction from Google:
widgetworld.com/AcmeWidgets
The Quest for the Holy Grail of Advertising
Wouldn’t it be nice to be given a magical formula where an ad always received a click 
and a conversion? Unfortunately, there is no magic formula for writing ads. Writing 
the perfect ad copy is like the search for the Holy Grail. It is a never-ending search of 
examining where you have been, ascertaining where others have gone, and plotting 
new paths to see where they lead.
Ad copy changes depending not only on your industry but on your company’s 
specific customer base as well. Consider two different accounting software compa-
nies, one specializing in Quicken and the other in Peachtree. Quicken is generally used 
for personal finance; Peachtree is generally used for business bookkeeping. Although 
these are technically both accounting software firms, their customers are different. 
Therefore, their ad copy should also be different to showcase why they are distinct 
from each other.
Just because an ad works for your competition does not mean it will work for 
you. Sometimes a company will start advertising, choose an ad that has been running 
for a competitor, and just duplicate that ad in their account. Ignoring the ethics of such 
tactics for a moment, you should know that this tactic will often fail. Each business has 
a different website, different sales pitches, and various benefits and features. These dif-
ferences often cause an ad for one company not to work for another.
Each ad will have different CTR and conversion rates when paired with different 
keywords. Let’s say you wrote ad copy about high-definition televisions and used these 
keywords to trigger that ad copy:
••
Plasma TV
••
Buy a plasma TV
••
LED TV
••
Compare LED to plasma TVs
••
HDTV
Each of those keywords will have vastly different conversion rates and CTRs. 
The user intent, commercial intent, keyword specificity, landing page, and ad copy all 
come together to form different metrics for keyword and ad copy pairs.

Chapter 4:  W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds  ■
136
These are important points to keep in mind when looking at ads used by other 
companies. Just because a company has used an ad for several years does not mean it’s 
effective. You do not know how much another company is testing ads, what their suc-
cess metrics are, or how well those ads blend with your landing pages.
You do need to examine your competitors’ ads to make sure your ads stand out 
on a search page. If all the ads showcase pricing, try a different message. If all the ads 
speak only of benefits, try using a question in your ad copy.
If you need a formula to start with, I have found that the following are good 
starting places. Through solid testing you may find that they are not the best ads after 
testing, but they will get you started.
••
Ad copy 1
••
Compelling headline
••
Customer benefit
••
Call to action
••
Ad copy 2
••
Compelling headline (use a different one than in ad copy 1)
••
Product/service feature
••
Customer benefit
PPC success is measured with hard numbers. You should know statistics such as 
CTR, conversion rate, average sale amount, lifetime visitor values, and profit per sale. 
These numbers will show you which ad copy and keyword combination is most suc-
cessful based on your metrics.
When you are writing ad copy, it is one of the few times you can escape from 
numbers and use the right side of your brain for a while. Ad copy writing can be a fun 
exercise in utilizing different adjectives, marketing messages, unique selling proposi-
tions, features, and benefits. Let your creative juices flow. The numbers will eventually 
tell you which ad is the most successful for your company. However, until that time, be 
creative, test, and find new messages that resonate with searchers.
If you do not test various messages, you will never know what messages resonate 
best with your customers. Knowing which ads drive the most profit will not only make 
you more successful but will also shift you from chasing your competitors to being a 
market leader.
Best Practices for Writing Compelling Ads
Writing, refining, and testing ad copy is an ongoing process that can lead to higher 
CTRs, higher conversion rates, and ultimately higher profits for your company. The 

■  Be st Pr ac t ice s for W r i t i ng Com pelli ng A ds

following is a checklist of items to continuously keep in mind as you strive to find that 
perfect ad:
••
Ensure that your ads correspond tightly with the search query. When a con-
sumer conducts a search, they are seeking specific pieces of information. Make 
sure that your ads can speak to the consumer’s search query and show them how 
you can help them find their answers.
••
Develop granular ad groups to create a scenario where your ads are appropriate 
to both your keywords and the search query.
••
Ensure that your ads are understandable. Jargon is acceptable only if the con-
sumer knows the jargon. Do not use jargon for keywords that fall into the begin-
ning stages of the buying funnel, because the searcher may not know the lexicon 
in their early research phases.
••
Create a unique selling proposition for your business. This will differentiate 
your business from the other ads on the page.
••
Features are facts about your product or service. Showcase features when some-
one is comparing products or services.
••
Utilize benefits to connect emotionally with the searcher. Benefits inform some-
one why your product will make their life better.
••
Direct a consumer to take action. If you inform the searcher what you want 
them to do after the click, they are more predisposed to seek and conduct that 
action.
••
Test different types of ad copy.
••
Use the display URL to clarify to a searcher where they will arrive after they 
click.
••
Use ad extensions; at a minimum, use the sitelinks extensions.
••
If you are an e-commerce company, use product listing ads.
••
Never be satisfied with your ad copy. Journey down the never-ending quest to 
find the perfect ad copy.
These best practices should help guide you in creating effective ads that will con-
nect with searchers and lead them to your website, where you can continue to engage 
them and show them how your company can fulfill their needs.
Once you have ads written, those ads need to go to landing pages that reflect the 
keywords and the ad copy. In the next chapter, we will examine what makes a landing 
page effective in turning a visitor into a customer.

Creating Landing 
Pages That Convert 
Searchers into Buyers
Where should you send a searcher after they 
click your ad? The homepage is rarely the best 
place. You have several options, and choosing 
the correct one will ensure that the visitor does 
not just view your website but becomes engaged 
with it as well.
First impressions last a lifetime, and that 
fact is just as true for websites as it is for people. 
If your website is trustworthy, friendly, and easy 
to use, it makes a good first impression, which 
increases the odds of your turning clicks into 
buyers.

Does Your Landing Page Answer the Searcher’s Question?
You advertised on a keyword. Your ad copy was compelling enough for someone to 
click on it. You paid for a click, and you received a visitor. Now it’s time for your web-
site to convert that visitor into a customer.
The term “landing page” is industry jargon for the first page of your site some-
one visits after clicking on an ad. It might not be the homepage of your website. It 
could be any page within your site or a page built specifically for your ad campaign.
Often, the only information the searcher has about your website is what is con-
tained in your ad copy. A searcher has only a maximum of 130 characters of knowl-
edge about what they are about to find after the click. Most searchers will spend just a 
few seconds looking at your landing page before deciding to continue interacting with 
your website—or to click the Back button. Therefore, the first thing your landing page 
must do is answer several questions that are going through the searcher’s mind. These 
questions are not all related to their initial search query; they are related to the quality 
of your website and a searcher’s ability to extract information from the web page:
Am I in the correct place?   This is the first question your website must quickly answer. 
Someone did a search attempting to find an answer to a question. If you look at your 
landing page for three to five seconds, does the page appear to lead someone down the 
path to finding their answer?
Is this what I expected?  Is your landing page an extension of your ad copy? Is the informa-
tion contained in your ad showcased on the landing page? If your ad mentioned prod-
uct comparisons and your landing page shows only a single product review, you are 
not setting the expectations properly in the ad copy, and a visitor is likely to leave your 
website. Ensure that your ads are not just the same theme as the keyword but are set-
ting the proper expectations for what someone will see after the click.
Do I trust this site?  Trust is a major concern for many searchers. It is common for demo-
graphics that are not overly familiar with the Web to need additional reassurance that 
their credit card or personal information will be safe. Conversely, those who are more 
familiar with the Web know how to quickly look for SSL certificates, whether a site has 
HTTPS (secure pages) components, and if there’s a privacy policy. I will cover more on 
trust elements later in this book.
How long will this take?  People value their time. Before committing to any action, many 
people unconsciously calculate how long it will take to accomplish that action. If the 
landing page consists of a long, intimidating form, the perception will be that there 
will be a high time commitment to complete the action on the site. Make sure that pro-
cess seems quick. If your landing page is a form, just tell how long it will take (such as 
“This is a three-page form that will take five minutes of your time”).

What should I do next?  Does your landing page have a clear call to action? Once someone 
sees your landing page and has been satisfied that the preceding questions have been 
answered, what do you want them to do? Though people can be resistant to being 
told what to do, when they are unsure of the next action they are more open to being 
informed about what their next action should be. Tell your visitors what the next step 
is for them to obtain their answer.
Where should I go next?  This aspect is closely related to “What should I do next?” If 
someone knows what to do next, do they know how to do it? Does your site have a 
clear path to action? The human mind can hold five to seven thoughts in short-term 
memory. If your website has 20 links on the landing page all going to different places, 
you can confuse the visitor. Your main button or image on the landing page should be 
where you want the visitor to go next. The button could be a subscription, add-to-cart 
button, or “contact us” form. Make sure that your primary action for a landing page 
stands out from the rest of the page’s content.
Should I click the Back button?  One of the most common navigational elements on the Web, 
and the one that loses websites the most visitors, is the dreaded Back button.
Regardless of how you code your site, choose your design, and lay out informa-
tion, there will be visitors who click the Back button. You cannot be all things to all 
people. You can try to minimize how often the Back button is clicked by making sure 
all these questions are quickly and easily answered. If any of these questions are not 
quickly answered, you risk losing a visitor.
You’re a Bad Judge of Your Website
Unfortunately, this is a true statement for almost all marketers and designers. You know that the big 
red button is a link that takes someone to the subscription page. You know that the images are not 
linked and that clicking on them will not let you see a larger image or take you to that product page. 
You know that your phone number is buried in your banner-like header.
Ask a colleague, spouse, customer, or someone else not familiar with your website to complete an 
action on your site. Give them a specific direction such as “contact us,” “buy this product,” or “sub-
scribe to our newsletter.” Now watch how they navigate through your website.
Even better, take five to seven people and ask them to do the same action. If you ask ten people to 
complete an action, you may see five to seven different ways that the exact same action was com-
pleted. Do not just watch how they completed the action; look for signs when they are lost, such as 
clicking on a non-hyperlinked image.
Many analytics programs have a reverse goal path report. This report shows you the different pages 
that someone visited before completing an action. By examining the reverse goal path report, you can 
gain insight into how visitors are navigating your website.

The first question echoing through someone’s mind when they visit your land-
ing page is, “Am I in the correct place?” Does your landing page reflect the ad copy? 
Choosing which page you send the traffic to is an important decision since it is the 
first step in engaging visitors. You have several options about where to send the traffic 
depending on if you use keyword-level, placement-level, or ad copy–level destination 
URLs. First let’s focus on how and where to create destination URLs; then I’ll discuss 
where to send the traffic.
Everything about Destination URLs
There are three ways within AdWords to choose where you send traffic for a particu-
lar click.
The first is at the ad level. In this instance, every click from that ad goes to the 
same landing page. An ad group can have several different ads (or even different ad 
types, as discussed in Chapter 8, “Beyond Text: Image, Video, and Mobile Ads”). 
Every ad must have a destination URL specified, but that URL can be different for each 
ad (Figure 5.1). 
Figure 5.1  The destination URL is the last entry in your ad.
The second way you can set a destination URL is at the individual keyword 
level. Doing so is optional. If you create keyword-level URLs, these URLs are used 
instead of the ad destination URL (Figure 5.2).
The most common reason to use keyword destination URLs is for tracking pur-
poses. Some analytics and bid-management systems need to set custom parameters for 
each URL so they can read and track the data. If you have well-organized ad groups 
so the ad destination URL is a good landing page for all the keywords in the ad group, 
and you are not using a third-party system that requires keyword-level tracking, then 
there is usually not a need to use keyword-level URLs.

■  Ev ery t h i ng a bou t De st i nat ion U R L s
143
Figure 5.2  Adding or editing a keyword-level destination URL
When you set a keyword-level destination URL for automatic placements 
on the Google Display Network (you’ll find a detailed explanation in Chapter 9, 
“Understanding the Display Network”), Google will attempt to determine which 
keyword best matches the content of the page your ad appears on and will use the 
corresponding keyword-level destination URL. Otherwise, it will default to using 
the ad-level destination URL. The third way to set a destination URL applies only to 
the display network. When specifying display targeting options (again, see Chapter 9 
for more details), you have the option of setting a destination URL for the targeting 
method where you have enabled custom bids (Figure 5.3). Only one custom bid can be 
set per ad group. So if your custom bid is by keyword, you can set keyword-level desti-
nation URLs for display ads; however, if your custom bid is set for topics, then you can 
enable a destination URL at the topic level.
Figure 5.3  Enabling custom bids for targeting options

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
144
If you have specified a custom bid destination URL, then that URL is used when 
someone clicks on your ad. If you do not specify a custom bid-level destination URL, 
then the destination URL of the ad is used to determine where to send the visitor.

Building destination URLs for accurate tracking can be tricky, because you need 
to consider the wildcard variables that Google will fill in for you (such as the keyword) 
and what your analytics system can understand. In the next sections, I will walk you 
through examples of how to build destination URLs so you can gain insight into visi-
tors’ behavior once they have reached your website.
Using Destination URLs for Tracking
For tracking purposes, you might want to add additional parameters to your des-
tination URLs. Some may be dictated by your tracking system, and there are some 
variables that Google supports. This is why a destination URL can be 2,048 charac-
ters—when you start adding tracking parameters to a URL, they can grow quite long.
These additional parameters are not for visitors. They should not affect where 
a visitor goes on your site. These additional variables are for your tracking purposes, 
whether you are parsing them out in log files or in a separate analytics system.
URL Parameters: Understanding the Basics
In a URL, the question mark is a delimiter that signals the beginning of the query 
string portion of your URL. The query string is what contains parameters, also known 
as variables or tags. The process of adding these variables to your destination URLs 
is referred to as “adding tags” or simply “tagging.” The ampersand (&) is used to 
separate multiple parameters/variables in the query string. The question mark comes 
right after the URL of your landing page, and it is followed by the tracking variables 
separated by ampersands. In certain server environments, you may also need to add a 
forward slash directly preceding the question mark (?) character. 
In addition, do not leave spaces in destination URLs. Some systems interpret 
spaces as %20 or %2B, some leave them as spaces, and some add a plus (+) sign. By 
using a space, you could break the URL for some visitors, causing them to see a 404 
(error) page on your website.

■  Ev ery t h i ng a bou t De st i nat ion U R L s
145
You should always test to make sure your destination URLs work properly 
before putting them live. For instance, if you wanted to send a visitor to  
www.certifiedknowledge.org for the search term AdWords seminars, and you wanted 
to add source and keyword parameters to the destination URL for tracking purposes, 
your final destination URL would be
www.certifiedknowledge.org?src=AdWords&keyword=adwords+seminars
The most common tracking parameters to add to an AdWords URL are as 
follows:
••
Source 
••
Medium (what type of traffic—in this instance, PPC)
••
Campaign
••
Ad group
••
Ad ID
••
Ad type (for tracking product listing ads)
••
Keyword
••
Keyword match type
••
Network (search or display network source)
••
Mobile
••
Ad position
••
Placement
Some of these tracking parameters are supported by Google with variable 
replacements, which means that when you use these parameters in your destination 
URL query string, Google fills in that variable with the actual campaign data and 
passes that data along to you in the destination URL when someone clicks on your ad 
and comes to your landing page. This data is useful if you want to track performance 
at the ad level. 
Adding Custom Parameters to Destination URLs
Not all the parameters we mentioned previously (such as ad group) are supported by 
Google for automatic variable replacement for your ad-level destination URLs. If you 
wanted to track that set of information, you would need to build keyword-level desti-
nation URLs. For instance, if you have built your own in-house tracking system or you 
are using a third-party system that needs to know additional data, such as ad group or 
ad type (text or image), then you need to add these parameters manually to your desti-
nation URLs. 
The variables that Google supports are shown in Table 5.1.

When you see YourName inside one of the parameters, you should replace it 
with your own information. For instance, when I am tracking search, I will use 
{ifsearch:Search}. If you are using your own tracking system or a customizable analyt-
ics system, you should match the variables in your destination URLs to how your ana-
lytics system needs to read and interpret the data.
The keyword parameter will pick up the keyword that caused your ad to be 
triggered. The ad ID is unique to every ad in your AdWords account. The easiest way 
to associate an ad with the ad ID is to either use the API (a back-end program that 
lets your database communicate with the AdWords database) or run an ad report and 
include the ad ID data point in the report.
The two interesting variables are ifsearch and ifcontent. All clicks come from 
either search or display. AdWords will automatically include which network sent you 
traffic. If your click originated from a placement, the placement information will be 
included in the URL.
Some of these variables represent features of AdWords that will be discussed in 
later chapters, such as the display network and placement categories.
There are a few other variables that can be used only through the API, such as 
{param1}, which are variable replacements for specific aspects of ad copy. If you are an 

■  Ev ery t h i ng a bou t De st i nat ion U R L s
147
API user who is often changing the prices or discounts in ads, I recommend looking 
more into the param variables.
For the majority of users, the variables in Table 5.1 are enough to be able to track 
the data necessary to understand the user behavior inside your analytics program.
Step-by-Step Guide to Building Destination URLs
I will illustrate how to build destination URLs at the ad level. Since one of the variables 
is placement, you can use this same URL at the placement level as well.
Although I am not going to dive deep into Google Analytics, it is important to 
incorporate your tracking system’s variables into your destination URLs. Therefore, in 
these examples you will use the main variables of Google Analytics. However, please 
examine your own analytics system first to understand the parameters necessary for 
your own system.
Google Analytics has a URL Builder tool (Figure 5.4), which can be found at 
https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en (or you can search for 
“Google Analytics URL Builder”).
Figure 5.4  Google Analytics URL Builder

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
148
Google Analytics uses the main variables shown in Table 5.2. When you see 
YourName, this means you can input anything you desire to help you understand what 
data point is being referenced.
▶
▶Table 5.2  Google Analytics traffic classifications 
Google Analytics Name
Google Analytics Formatting
Campaign Source (traffic source)
utm_source=YourName
Campaign Medium (marketing type)
utm_medium=YourName
Campaign Term (keyword, optional input)
utm_term= YourName
Campaign Content (ad types, optional input)
utm_content= YourName
Campaign Name
utm_campaign= YourName
Note that you can link your AdWords account with your Google Analytics 
account and see much of this data without having to code all of these URLs in 
AdWords. In some cases, you can combine both the analytics and the AdWords inputs, 
which will pass large amounts of information to your analytics program.
In addition, you do not have to code all these URLs one at a time. You can 
use formulas in Microsoft Excel or a tool such as the Certified Knowledge Google 
Analytics URL Builder, which will create all these URLs very quickly. These tools are 
also useful for building destination URLs that you use with your Bing or Twitter ads so 
you can examine all of your data in one system.
If you are building ad-level URLs, the one piece of data that is missing from the 
Table 5.2 variables is the ad group. Therefore, you will have to code that information 
directly into the URL. 
The following URL contains information for Google Analytics data, Google 
AdWords variable replacements, and the manual coding of the source ad group. This 
would be your final ad URL:
http://certifiedknowledge.org /?utm_source=AdWords&utm_medium=PPC&utm_term=
{keyword}&utm_content={creative}&utm_campaign=AdWordsSeminars&Network=
{ifContent:Display}{ifSearch:Search}&SiteTarget={placement}&AdGroup=
ChicagoSeminars
While this would be your ad destination URL, it is not what the URL will look 
like when someone makes it to your website. To illustrate the final URL, let’s assume 
that these are the variables that triggered your ad:
••
Keyword: AdWords
••
Ad Group Name: Chicago Seminars
••
Campaign Name: AdWords Seminars
••
User clicked on a search click

■  Ev ery t h i ng a bou t De st i nat ion U R L s
149
Here is the final destination URL once the variables are replaced by actual values:
http://certifiedknowledge.org/?utm_source=AdWords&utm_medium=PPC&utm_term=
AdWords&utm_content=123456&utm_campaign=AdWordsSeminars&Network=
Search&SiteTarget=&AdGroup=ChicagoSeminars
Please note that the spaces were taken out of the ad group and campaign names 
so the URLs did not break. You do not want to leave spaces in your URLs. 
You will rarely look at these URLs after you build them. What is important 
is to know how to build the URLs so that your tracking system can parse the infor-
mation from the URL and store it appropriately in a system where the data is easily 
understandable. 
The same URL can also be used at the keyword level. There are a few reasons to 
have destination URLs at the keyword level—for example, if your keywords are going 
to different pages. If this is the case, be careful that the keywords in your ad groups are 
tightly themed. Rarely will you send different keywords to different pages. It’s most 
common in very large accounts that are supporting hundreds of thousands of keywords.
Another reason to do keyword-level tracking is that some tracking systems need 
keyword-level destination URLs because they use different variables for tracking key-
words, or they may add additional parameters to the URL for other purposes. This is 
a system-by-system consideration, and your vendor should be able to help you format 
these URLs (or they may do it automatically for you).
Some systems grab the keyword from the URL and do a site search or add key-
word-specific information to the landing page. In these cases, the systems will want to 
ensure they know the exact keyword being clicked by coding it into the URL.
Linking AdWords and Google Analytics for Data Insights
If you are using Google Analytics, the best action to take is to link AdWords and Google Analytics 
together. If you link these two systems together, then you do not want to use the Google Analytics 
utm codes in your destination URLs because your data will be double counted in Google Analytics. 
While using specific parameters, especially for PLA tracking, is very useful, Google Analytics does not 
show much PLA data at the moment. Although most of the data is automatically passed to Google 
Analytics, the data that is not passed can easily be accessed from AdWords reports, which will be cov-
ered in depth in Chapter 16, “AdWords Reports: Extracting Actionable Information.”
Adding additional tracking parameters such as ValueTrack is necessary when you are using home-built 
analytics systems or other systems that do not automatically add tracking codes to your AdWords 
destination URLs. 
When you first set up your Google Analytics account, do so from within your 
AdWords account. During the setup process, Google Analytics will recommend that 

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
150
you auto-tag your links so that information can be passed from AdWords to Analytics. 
Just answer yes to this question.
If you have already set up a Google Analytics account and you are unsure 
whether the data is being passed, there are two things to check:
	 1.	
Navigate to Google Analytics from within your AdWords account (Tools & 
Analysis > Google Analytics). You will see either the Google Analytics interface 
(in which case you should move to step 2) or a setup wizard. In the setup wizard, 
there is an option to link an existing Analytics account to AdWords. Just follow 
those instructions to link them together.
	 2.	
Navigate to My Account > Preferences. Under Tracking (see Figure 5.5), make 
sure Auto-tagging is marked Yes.
Figure 5.5  Auto-tagging AdWords data for Google Analytics
If you turn on Auto-tagging, do not manually code destination URLs with UTM 
variables, because Google Analytics will become confused and will often double-count 
your traffic or improperly account for the data. Auto-tagging inserts a tag called gclid 
into the destination URL, which is click data from AdWords that Google Analytics 
uses to automatically track your Google AdWords data.
Note:  If you are having problems seeing your Google Analytics data in AdWords, seeing your AdWords data 
in Google Analytics, or connecting the two accounts together, in most cases the problem is that you are not an 
admin for both the Google Analytics and Google AdWords accounts. Ensure that when you are linking the accounts 
together and viewing Google Analytics data in AdWords you are an admin on both accounts. 
The last tag you can use is the no override tag. This tag tells Google Analytics 
not to overwrite the cookie data for the user if there is already a Google Analytics 
cookie for your domain on their computer. This tag is useful if you find that many peo-
ple first search for a product name and come to your site and then search again for your 

■  Ev ery t h i ng a bou t De st i nat ion U R L s
151
brand term and come to your site and buy. In that scenario, Google Analytics will show 
you that the brand name is leading to many conversions and that the initial terms have 
zero conversions. Since the no override tag will not cause the cookie to be overwritten, 
if the user checks out at a later visit, the originally referring data, such as the keyword, 
will be attributed to the conversion. If you are using attribution management (assigning 
different conversion values to different user actions), discussed in-depth in Chapter 13, 
“Devising Profitable Bid Strategies,” this is a useful additional tag to employ.
Destination URLs most commonly occur at the ad, keyword, ad extension, or 
custom display bid level within your AdWords account. They do exist in other areas, 
such as remarketing (discussed in Chapter 10, “Utilizing Advanced Display Network 
Techniques,” however, unless your tracking system requires additional data, you do not 
have to set destination levels for every possible feature within AdWords. You can add 
additional parameters any way you want to the URL, as long as the final URL renders 
to an actual page in the browser.
By using custom destination URLs, you can pass certain pieces of information 
to your tracking, lead-generation, e-commerce, or custom database that will help you 
understand what keywords, ad copy, placements, and so forth are sending you high-
quality traffic.
There are a few editorial policies that your destination URL must meet before it 
will be approved by Google. First I will cover these policies, and then I will move on to 
where on your website you should send the traffic.
Complying with Destination URL Editorial Policies
There are a few editorial policies that your destination URLs must follow. The first is 
quite simple: the URL must be 2,048 or fewer characters and resolve to an actual page. 
Second, the destination URL must go to the same root domain as the display URL of 
the ad. Table 5.3 shows examples of display and destination URLs and how they com-
ply with the editorial guidelines. 
▶
▶Table 5.3  Display and destination URL editorial examples

(CertifiedKnowledge.org and 
google.com) are different.

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
152
If your display URL is longer than 35 characters, AdWords will truncate the dis-
play URL when it is shown in the search results. If AdWords is truncating your display 
URL, it will be useful to buy that domain and redirect it to your site. When your ad is 
shown often, users will start to remember your domain name, and you want to make 
sure that if someone types the displayed domain name into the browser the traffic goes 
to a site you own. 
The third editorial policy also influences your display URL: all ads within the 
same ad group must go to the same root domain. This means that you cannot send 
traffic from one ad (or keyword) to a different root domain from any other ad (or key-
word) within the same ad group.
If you owned two domains, such as CertifiedKnowledge.org and ewhisper.net, 
even if the content on both sites is the same, you could not send traffic within the same 
ad group to those two separate domains.
Since this editorial rule is for each individual ad group, you can send traffic from 
one ad group to one domain (such as CertifiedKnowledge.org) and then have the traffic 
from a second ad group sent to a different domain (such as ewhisper.net). Therefore, if 
you want to test two different domains, you can accomplish this by using two different 
ad groups.
The exception to this rule is proxy domains. A proxy domain occurs when a 
third party pulls your domain into their system before it is displayed to a user. This 
usually occurs when a third party is changing part of your site, such as the phone 
number or contact forms, for tracking purposes. In that instance, if your website is 
example.com and the final URL is example.proxysite.com, this is allowed because your 
domain and the subdomain of the proxy site are the same. 
Many of the display URL and destination URL policies revolve around where to 
send the visitor and are intertwined with each other. Therefore, always keep the poli-
cies of both these ad copy aspects in mind when writing destination and display URLs.
Choosing Landing Pages That Increase Conversion Rates
You can send traffic to any page on your website (assuming it conforms to editorial 
policies), but you will see drastic differences in conversion rates depending on where on 
your site you are sending your paid search traffic.
The best page is the one that answers the advertiser’s question. Where on your 
site can they receive the answer to their original search question? Another way of 
thinking about this concept is to send traffic to the page that is the farthest logical page 
in your website that starts the conversion process for each keyword.
Note:  Please remember that the searcher might have to buy a product, fill out a lead-generation or contact 
form, or place a phone call to receive their answer. On your website, you are answering the question or showing the 
consumer how to receive the answer.

153
Consider these three points:
••
People enjoy being lazy.
••
People do not want more work.
••
You are the expert on your website.
Why would you not choose the exact page on your site the visitor should see 
first? If you do not send someone to the best page on your site for the query, visitors 
will start to wander around your website, which will take them off the conversion 
path, or they will just hit the Back button and visit the next site on the list.
Taking the extra time to link your keywords or ad groups with the most specific 
page on your website will help keep visitors focused and moving down the buying fun-
nel toward becoming a customer. 
Choosing Landing Pages Based on the Type of Query
To best determine a landing page, you need to understand the three main types of key-
word queries:
Transactional Query  Transactional queries are those in which there is an intent to buy. 
These are often called commercial searches.
Informational Query  Informational queries, or noncommercial queries, are those in which 
the searcher is looking for a specific piece of information or is trying to learn more 
about a specific item or concept.
Navigational Query  Navigational queries are those in which the searcher is just trying to 
navigate to a specific website or web page. There is often only one satisfactory result 
for the user. This type of query might be Amazon.com Prime shipping information. 
In this case, the user wants to find one specific page on Amazon.com, and the other 
results hold little interest for the searcher.
These query types are described in detail in the following sections.
Leveraging Transactional Queries
The easiest examples to use when deciding where to send traffic are commercial-based 
queries. Most shopping carts have a homepage that provides navigation into category 
pages and from category pages to the product page. Category pages showcase all of a 
product type (for instance, all Samsung or all DLP TVs), and a product page highlights 
a single product. Although many shopping carts contain many more types of pages, 
almost all have these three types of pages (home, category, and product). 
When examining where to send traffic, imagine, for example, someone is doing 
a search for Samsung UN85S9AFXZA (which is the part number for a Samsung Smart 
TV) and you send the searcher to the homepage of your site. In this instance, the visitor 
has to search again (or attempt to browse through your website) using the same query 

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
154
they just performed on Google. This additional action of searching again is redundant 
and akin to giving the searcher more work. The more tasks you assign your visitors, 
the more visitors are going to refuse your tasks and go back to Google and look at your 
competitors’ ads.
If you send the searcher to the Samsung Smart TV category page, the searcher 
then needs to look through the available selections and try to find the same TV. If your 
category pages do not have part numbers listed, or if the searcher knows your product 
under a different name than the one listed, the visitor has no idea where to go next and 
will often click the Back button.
If you send the searcher directly to the Samsung UN85S9AFXZA product 
information page, you have done the hard work of finding the best page for them. The 
searcher will spend less time trying to find the information and more time engaged 
with the information on your website. This example of a good search experience 
should lead to higher conversion rates.
If you know where on your website you should send traffic, why make the searcher 
take the time to find the information? The more freedom you give someone to wander 
around your site and make decisions, the lower the conversion rates you will see.
There is a balance between giving someone enough information and options to 
make a decision and maximizing conversion rates. Always make sure you answer the 
searcher’s question. That and any offer made within the ad copy (such as free shipping) 
is the minimum amount of information you should present on your landing page.
While product searches are common on the Web and an easy first example, let’s 
examine some different classifications of search queries to see where conventional wis-
dom would suggest sending the traffic.
Getting Conversions from Informational Queries
A 2007 Pennsylvania State University study, “Determining the Informational, 
Navigational, and Transactional Intent of Web Queries,” by Bernard Jansen, 
Danielle Booth, and Amanda Spink (http://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/
pubs/­jansen_user_intent.pdf), concluded that over 80 percent of all queries are infor-
mational, whereas the remaining 20 percent are about half navigational and half trans-
actional. Often this information is misinterpreted to assume that only 10 percent of 
queries can lead to a purchase.
If you keep the buying funnel in mind, you are reminded that purchase decisions 
are usually based on research and learning before buying. While there are informational 
queries that cannot be monetized, often informational queries are undermonetized, and 
one of the most common reasons is choosing an incorrect landing page.
If a searcher does not have enough information to make a decision, even a per-
fectly designed sales page will not convert most visitors. In some cases, the information 
may be on the product page, and sending a user to the product page is the best course 
of action.

It is important to look at your keywords and think like the searcher. If a 
searcher input a particular keyword, what scenario going on in their life might have 
caused that search? It is that scenario that your landing page needs to address. By 
addressing such scenarios, you can include additional information on the landing page 
to help you monetize informational queries.
For instance, the query candle burning times is an informational query. Often 
the ads for this type of query end up sending the user to a specific candle type or 
maybe a candle product page. Those pages do not have an easy way for the user to see 
the burning times of all the candles.
Why would someone want to know how long different candles burn? Here are a 
few reasons:
••
Romantic dinner
••
Religious service
••
Emergency lighting
••
Meditation
••
Halloween haunted house
••
Relaxing bath
••
Wedding
The list could continue with hundreds of examples. In each of those instances, 
you could imagine wanting to know how long a candle will burn. For example, a host 
would not want his candles to burn down halfway through a dinner party.
Instead of sending those searchers to a candle product page or category page, 
send them to a page that lists the types of candles (votive, taper, and so on) and how 
long those different candle models will burn. Then you can link the candle type, a call 
to action, or a buy-now button to the product pages so the visitor can buy the candle 
that best meets their needs.
Any Business Can Leverage Informational Queries
Informational queries and shopping carts are easy examples. However, the concept of 
answering the question and then showing a way for a searcher to do business with your 
company can be accomplished regardless of your business model.
In April 2008, at the height of the tax season, a search for sales tax deduction 
in Washington, D.C., yielded zero ads for accounting firms (and only four total ads, 
all going to search result pages of various search engines). Yet a search for sales tax 
deduction was conducted over 50,000 times in the United States that same month. 
During April, bids for tax-based keywords skyrocket, and many of the direct key-
words such as tax, tax return, tax accountant, and the like become too expensive for 
accounting firms or software companies to bid high enough to be displayed on page 1. 

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
156
In January 2010, that same search query in Chicago yielded zero ads for accounting 
software or firms even though the query continues to yield over 1,000 queries a month 
outside of tax season. In October 2013, that query had 1,600 searches and there are 
still no ads on the page for this query. This is another example of an informational 
keyword being undermonetized year after year. 
What about Publishers?
If you are a publisher, such as a newspaper, most of your traffic will come from informational queries. 
Publishers often make money by selling ads to their advertiser base. Usually publishers are paid on 
an impression basis (often called CPM, cost per thousand impressions). Then the publisher buys traffic 
from a search engine. The difference between what they make on a page view from the ads they sold 
and the cost of the click they paid to the search engine is their profit (profit = income from displayed 
ad – cost per click.) If a searcher visits several pages, the publisher makes money on each page view. 
One of the key success metrics, and often a conversion action, for publishers is page views per visit. If 
publishers can double their page views per visit, they’ll increase their profits significantly.
Publishers generally have secondary conversions, such as subscriptions. It is important for publishers 
to measure both page views and any secondary conversions that result from informational queries, 
so they can determine the true value of paid search clicks on informational queries and continue to 
optimize their pages to encourage more paid subscriptions. 
There is often less competition on informational queries (and cheaper clicks) because they are harder 
for product companies to monetize, and so they don’t always advertise on them. For publishers, how-
ever, this can create a big opportunity to buy more cost-effective traffic on review or breaking-news 
queries, to give searchers the information they are seeking, and also to sell them subscriptions. 
If your accounting firm can create a page that explains what a sales tax deduc-
tion is and how your firm can help someone decide to use sales tax or income tax as 
their deduction, this can help your company monetize an informational query.
In this case, even if the informational query has a lower conversion rate than 
more commercial queries, the lack of advertisers will most likely cause this keyword 
to be an inexpensive click. Lower-converting, inexpensive clicks can often result in a 
lower cost per acquisition than a high-converting, expensive click.
Informational queries make up a large percentage of total web searches. If you 
treat these types of searches like transactional searches where you just send visitors to 
shopping cart pages or form-fills, you will not find a lot of success with informational 
queries.
If you answer the searcher’s question first and then try to monetize the searcher 
based on the information you presented to them, you will have much more success 
advertising on information-based keywords. Never forget to answer the searcher’s 
question. That’s the searcher’s primary objective for conducting a search.

■  Choosi ng L a n di ng Page s T h at I ncr e ase Con v ersion R at e s
157
Once you have answered the question and the searcher has engaged with your 
website, you should introduce commercial actions. Selling is not just about the best 
sales pitch. You need to wait for the proper moment to introduce the pitch.
Getting the Most from Navigational Queries
Navigational queries are difficult to monetize because the user is often looking for a 
specific company or web page and only that result will satisfy their search. For most 
companies, monetizing navigational queries for other companies is difficult. For exam-
ple, a search for Barnes and Noble usually means someone wants to go to the Barnes 
& Noble website and does not want to go to Amazon.
You can attempt to buy some navigational queries to see how they work for 
your company, but they are keywords you should put in separate ad groups and watch 
the traffic. If these keywords are not providing clicks or conversions, feel free to delete 
them.
If your business is not easily found for your brand terms, website name, or busi-
ness name, you will want to make sure you are buying those terms so searchers can 
find your website. If your product page is listed number one in the organic results for a 
navigational query, you should test sending AdWords traffic to a different page. Since 
ranking organically takes time and effort and changing a page could jeopardize your 
rankings, testing dedicated PPC landing pages that are built for conversions can lead to 
higher profits.
In addition, if you are considering a site redesign, buy the navigational keywords 
for the new design to see if the new design will have a positive effect on the page’s 
profitability.
Differentiating Local Business Queries
The term “local business” is often misunderstood. A local business is one with a physi-
cal address or one that serves only a specific geographic area. This means that while 
the plumber down the street is a local business, so are Best Buy and JCPenney.
With local businesses, you first need to ask a few basic questions:
••
Who is your target audience?
••
Locals
••
Nonlocals (travelers)
••
Who travels to whom?
••
Customer travels to business (Best Buy, lawyer)
••
Business travels to customer (plumber, lawn care)
••
Where are the products sold?
••
Online
••
In store

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
158
Until you answer these questions, it is impossible to determine where to send 
a user.
If you have both a physical store and an online store, the rules of sending traffic 
are similar to the commercial query information just listed. Adding conversion options, 
such as in-store pickup or the benefits of viewing a product in person, to your land-
ing page gives consumers more reasons to do business with your company. If you do 
not sell online, the very first question to answer about local business marketing is with 
your target audience. Are they locals or nonlocals?
Locals know the area. They understand your specific use of geography. They 
want to know if you serve their area or they want directions to your business. Only 
after the user is satisfied with the geographic issues will they examine whether they 
should do business with your company. I will focus on some of these distinguishing 
factors of why someone should do business with you instead of your competitors later 
in this chapter.
Nonlocals are often business or leisure travelers. They do not immediately need 
to know that a hotel is located at a specific address, for example. Travelers want to 
know how close the hotel is to the airport, shopping districts, or major attractions. 
Your landing page should show what is around your location and why your hotel 
should be chosen over the competition.
You should not market to locals and nonlocals in the same way. These two 
groups have different knowledge sets about the area and different questions that need 
to be answered by your website. A local wants to know specific information right away. 
A nonlocal first needs to be reassured that they are in the correct place before moving 
to the next stage of evaluating your business. 
These differences extend to the ad copy as well. Consider these two description 
lines for our example hotel:
••
Located in the Water Tower Place
••
5 blocks from shopping district
Both refer to major shopping areas in downtown Chicago. A local already 
knows where the shopping districts are located; therefore, telling them your hotel is five 
blocks away does not give them additional information. Informing a local that you are 
in the Water Tower Place gives them precise information to make a decision about trav-
eling to the business.
Treat Mobile Differently From Desktops
If  you are advertising on both mobile and desktop devices, consider the different user intents by device. A 
search for JC Penny on a mobile device is often someone looking for driving directions or the nearest loca-
tion. That same search on a desktop could be someone looking to find a store or to buy online. In that case, 
you would want to use different destination URLs for your navigational queries based on the device type.

■  Choosi ng L a n di ng Page s T h at I ncr e ase Con v ersion R at e s
159
Conversely, telling a nonlocal about the Water Tower is a waste of ad copy char-
acters. If someone does not know where the Water Tower is located, why tell them your 
business location? Informing a nonlocal that your hotel is walking distance from the 
shopping district gives them the general information they need to know in planning for 
their trip.
With local advertising, you need to break down the messages based on the user’s 
knowledge of your area and by who is traveling, the customer or the business. Once 
a searcher is confident that your business serves their area, or they can easily travel to 
your business, only then should you move the visitor into the conversion funnel.
Using Segmentation Pages
There will be many times when you do not know the consumer intent of a keyword. It 
could be that the keyword is ambiguous or that the word could describe multiple aspects 
of your business. In these instances, using segmentation pages can help the consumer 
pick the option that describes their question. A segmentation page is where a user can 
self-select which aspect of your business they are interested in learning more about.
Consider a search for hotels or plane travel; is the searcher a business traveler 
or a leisure traveler? They each have different concerns, yet they will use the same key-
words when searching for information.
The keyword records management is one used by businesses that often want to 
locate a secure storage facility for their documents. However, in many B2B industries, 
prices (and the sales team) are divided into small, medium, and enterprise business. 
Each business type has different needs. Therefore, using a simple segmentation page 
(Figure 5.6), you can help the user find the correct information for their business type 
very quickly.
Figure 5.6  Iron Mountain segmentation page

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
160
Segmentation pages are most commonly used with narrow theme sites, but 
they can also be useful even within a larger site to help narrow down choices. 
Consider the TV-buying process. You ask the consumer to select an answer from 
each of these bullet points:
••
TV type (LED, plasma, LCD)
••
TV size (63, 61, 55, 51, 43, or 28 inch)
••
Price (over $2,000, $1,000–2,000, under $1,000)
Once you know those three answers, you will be able to narrow down which 
products are most relevant to the consumer. While this is usually referred to as a cat-
egory search or product refinement, the resulting page is a segmentation page, because 
it segments the products that are being presented to the user so the user can self-select 
which avenue to explore.
One drawback of a segmentation page is that it adds another page view and 
customer decision between the search query and the final conversion. The more pages 
in your conversion process and the more decisions you force someone to make, the 
higher your abandonment rate will be.
For most of your keywords, you will probably not need a segmentation page. If 
you have keywords that have multiple meanings or speak to different audiences, or if 
your website has multiple audience types, testing segmentation pages can allow you to 
successfully advertise on a larger set of keywords by presenting the consumer with an 
option for where to go next.
Using Forms as Landing Pages
The primary focus of your landing page can be a form. This approach is common if 
you are collecting contact information for lead generation or generating online quotes 
(such as insurance and mortgage quotes). 
While a form can be a good landing page, be sure you are also answering the 
searcher’s question. It is common to see a scenario where a user searched for merchant 
accounts, made it to the second page of the form, and then encountered a question such 
as, “What type of merchant account do you want?”
If the consumer has not learned about the various merchant accounts you offer, 
this question may cause them to abandon the form and start searching for different 
merchant account types. Make sure that product, company, or personal information 
you are asking for can be easily accessed from the form (Figure 5.7).
While the AdWords signup process is not perfect, it does contain important 
form elements:
••
Easy-to-follow steps
••
Short process that shows progression (top-left side)
••
Ability to easily find additional information without abandoning the form
••
Phone support if you need more assistance

161
Figure 5.7  The Google AdWords signup form contains FAQs on the left side.
Because Google is such a highly known brand, they don’t necessarily need to 
load up their forms pages with benefits statements, but for lesser-known brands, it is a 
very good idea to give consumers plenty of supporting information on the form page, 
such as what VentureDeal does on their page (Figure 5.8).
Figure 5.8  VentureDeal adds information to their form sign-up page.

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
162
A good example of adding information to a form is the CVV (card verification 
value) information from your credit card. Most credit cards have a three-digit code on 
the back of the card that is the security information for that card. It has become a com-
mon practice to show a picture of where to find that information on the card. However, 
American Express is different from most cards. The security number on an American 
Express card is a four-digit number on the front. For some time, American Express card 
holders had a difficult time checking out on websites that either validated a three-digit 
CVV or did not show where to find the number on an American Express card.
An e-commerce checkout is also a form. While it will not be your landing page, 
ensuring the information a consumer needs can be accessed from your form is impor-
tant regardless of where the form is on your website.
In addition, a page that is just a form is often not a good landing page because 
the consumer may not have enough information about your company or the products 
to make a decision. Your form landing pages should include benefits and calls to action 
within the text of the page.
In the English language, we read left to right, so it is usually best to put your 
text on the left and your form on the right so that searchers’ eyes end up at the form 
after reading your content.
Because forms are such a common element of websites, I will discuss forms 
again in the next chapter.
Thanking Your Customers
Thank-you pages are not landing pages, but they are an essential part of your website 
that your converting traffic will see. If someone converts on your website, they trusted 
your company enough to give you a credit card number, email address, or phone num-
ber. This is the start of your relationship with a customer. A properly framed landing 
page can turn a simple inquiry into a relationship. 
Some of the more common thank-you pages are these:
••
Thank you for shopping with us.
••
Thank you for contacting us.
••
Thank you for downloading our whitepaper.
While these thank-you pages are essential, they may be the least effectively uti-
lized pages on the entire Web. Thank-you pages are essential because they communi-
cate to the customer that an action has been completed. But what does your thank-you 
page really say to the visitor?
••
Thank you for shopping with us. You will receive an email with your shipping 
confirmation. Now go away.

■  Choosi ng L a n di ng Page s T h at I ncr e ase Con v ersion R at e s
163
••
Thank you for contacting us. We will get back to you within 24 hours. We’re 
finished with you until we have time to call you back.
••
Thank you for downloading our whitepaper. Enjoy reading our hard work. We 
hope you come back one day.
One of the hardest and most expensive goals to accomplish in marketing is 
to acquire a new customer. It is generally cheaper to maintain a customer than to 
gain a new customer. Thank-you pages can be the starting place of maintaining that 
relationship.
Instead of making your thank-you page a place where the visitor stops interact-
ing with your website, give the visitor additional options:
••
Thank you for shopping with us. Would you like to join our loyalty program 
and gain 10 percent off your next purchase?
••
Thank you for contacting us. We will call you back within 24 hours. Here’s a 
whitepaper about our company and products for you to read while we find the 
answer to your inquiry.
••
Thank you for downloading our whitepaper. Would you like to subscribe to our 
newsletter to stay on top of industry trends?
You can have multiple conversion funnels on your website. If your first conver-
sion funnel is an e-commerce checkout, your next conversion funnel should be for the 
user to either subscribe to your newsletter or join your loyalty program.
It is also useful to cross-sell or upsell from within your website. Adding a sub-
scription form to a “thank you for shopping” page or driving a consumer into an 
e-commerce experience after downloading a whitepaper is acceptable as long as the 
consumer is finding their information and trusting your website. You rarely want to 
surprise a user, but adding some twists here and there can be useful if the customer is 
having a good experience on your site. Of course, to find out if they are having a good 
experience, you need a solid analytics platform in place to make sure they are continu-
ing on your website after seeing some of these options.
If you are a B2B company with a six-month sales cycle, do not waste the oppor-
tunity to keep communicating with a potential client. Do not just let them download a 
whitepaper and walk away. Let the customer download the whitepaper and then sub-
scribe to your newsletter or request a product demonstration.
The thank-you page is a great place to test
••
Loyalty programs
••
Customer satisfaction surveys
••
Downloads such as whitepapers or catalogs
••
Offers to tell a friend or other social media options such as “Like our 
Face­book page”

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
164
Changing the messaging on your thank-you pages from being an ending point to 
a continuation point so you can keep moving visitors through your conversion funnels 
is essential to increasing the profitability of your company.
Crafting Perfect Landing Pages
The perfect landing page is one that answers the searcher’s question and accomplishes 
your marketing goal. In this scenario, the searcher is satisfied with what they have 
acquired (which could be a new accounting firm to handle their taxes, a purchase, or 
a new subscription) and you have accomplished your marketing goal, which is usually 
what keeps your company open and in business.
There will be many times when you are not sure where to send the traffic. 
In these cases, you can test different landing pages and different layouts for those 
pages. Testing your landing pages is essential to refining your marketing efforts 
and receiving the highest return for your marketing investment dollars. Chapter 15, 
“Testing Techniques That Will Increase Profits,” shows you how to test ads, landing 
pages, and traffic.
Choosing a landing page is the first step to sending visitors to your website. 
The next step is making sure visitors can easily find the information on your landing 
page. This means that the web page should contain the answer and that the web page 
is coded in such a way that users can both find and read your information so they can 
continue to interact with your website.
Employing Usability, Trust, and Web Technology 
Usability is a catchall word used to describe how well users can navigate, find infor-
mation, and accomplish their goals on your website. Usability is often associated with 
users. However, usability should also be associated with conversion rates. If users can-
not find information on your website, they cannot complete an action.
If users do not trust your website, they will click the Back button. With the 
increasing number of phishing attacks, security concerns, and worms and viruses, 
users are becoming more concerned with protecting their computer and personal infor-
mation. If your site does not appear trustworthy, you will see visitors quickly leave.
The purpose of providing a good experience on your website is not just so users 
have a better experience and will return; it also ensures they can convert and your 
business can make money with your online marketing efforts.
Usability is so important that entire books are devoted to the subject. In this sec-
tion, I will highlight some of the most essential usability elements to ensure your web-
site has embraced the basics.

■  Em ploy i ng Usa bi li t y, T rust, a n d W eb T ech nology 
165
There are two main aspects to usability and conversion analysis: technical and 
psychological. Technical aspects stem from the technology being used by both the visi-
tor and the website to render the information. Different browsers, operating systems, 
servers, plug-ins, and your website’s code can completely change how a visitor sees and 
interacts with your information.
The second major factor that affects your usability is psychological: how a visi-
tor sees, understands, trusts, and is persuaded by your website. There are subtle ways 
of using images, color, and testimonials that can help increase your website’s profit.
Using Web Technology to Implement Usability and User Security
The foundation of any website is the actual code. There are different ways you can 
code your website so it has the exact same look and feel. However, while your website 
might appear the same on the surface, there are other technical issues (such as browsers 
or operating systems) that might render your website differently.
The browser market is diverse, offering Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, 
Opera, Chrome, and others. Some are aimed at special market segments, such as 
social network users. There are three different browsers with over 20 percent of the 
market share each (Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer). Five operating systems 
(Windows 8, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Mac OS) have roughly 
10 percent or higher market share each, so when you combine these operating systems 
with various browsers and dozens of ways to code your website, you create almost infi-
nite variations of ways your website could be viewed.
Luckily, there are only a few major factors that you need to be concerned with 
when examining the technical aspects of usability on your website, as explained in the 
following sections. 
Accessible Information
The text on a website can be coded in a few ways. There are usually two outcomes to 
the coding:
••
Font size is absolute—that is, it is not rendered smaller or larger in a browser.
••
Font size is relative; it can be rendered smaller or larger in a browser.
If your website that sells eyeglasses is coded in absolute font and a searcher has 
their browser set to show larger text (Figure 5.9), the searcher will still see your small 
text. If someone cannot read your website, they cannot convert on your website.
It is important to take a look at your demographics. If your website caters to 
groups that use screen readers or surf your website while viewing a larger font size, 
ensure that they can view your information in their preferred font size. Do not take 
away someone’s ability to read your site.

Figure 5.9  Resizing text in Chrome
Browser Compatibility
Different browsers render sites in different ways. Your site could look one way in 
Firefox and another way in Internet Explorer. You should surf your website, check out, 
test your contact forms, and so forth in the browsers used by your visitors to ensure 
that they can convert on your website regardless of their browser choice.
w3schools.com maintains global statistics on browser, JavaScript, screen reso-
lution, and many other web stats. As of September 2013, w3schools.com reported 
browser market share as follows:
	 1.	
Chrome (53.2%)
	 2.	
Firefox (27.8%)
	 3.	
Internet Explorer (12.1%)
	 4.	
Safari (3.9%)
	 5.	
Opera (1.7%)
You can view the updated information at this URL: www.w3schools.com/browsers/
browsers_stats.asp.
Combined, Firefox and Chrome have an 80 percent market share. If your web-
site worked in both browsers, could you assume that 80 percent of all traffic could 
view your website?

■  Em ploy i ng Usa bi li t y, T rust, a n d W eb T ech nology 
167
The answer is an absolute no. These numbers are global statistics and may not 
apply to your site at all. 
For instance, my blog’s (http://CertifiedKnowledge.org/blog) statistics 
(Figure 5.10) show a very different picture of Safari and Internet Explorer browser 
usage.
Figure 5.10  Safari leads to more revenue than IE on my blog.
In fact, when Chrome had less than 10 percent market share, my blog was 
almost 35 percent Chrome usage, and Firefox was about half. I have not seen Internet 
Explorer higher than 15 percent market share for more than four years on my blog. I 
work with one site that sees more than a third of their traffic from Safari (Figure 5.11).
Figure 5.11  Safari and IE lead Chrome on this e-commerce site.
If you examined the global browser usage statistics, you might not even test your 
site in some browsers. This is why you should look at your analytics system to deter-
mine what browsers your visitors are using. 
Note:  Never rely on global statistics to show you the entire picture of your site. Use actual data to determine 
how your site needs to be coded for your visitors.

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
168
When testing your website in different browsers, install just the default version 
of the browser, since many people do not change the default settings. Here’s how to do 
so in Internet Explorer: choose Tools > Internet Options > Advanced Options. There 
you can reset the browser to its default conditions (Figure 5.12).
Figure 5.12  Advanced Internet Explorer options
There are many errors you can tell your browser not to display to you again. If 
you choose not to see these errors, you cannot find them when surfing your website.
In general, look to see which browsers contribute more than 5 percent of your 
traffic (if you see a browser with a small percentage of traffic but a high conversion 
rate, you should also include it) and keep a default installation of those browsers 
on your computer. For Firefox, you can add a new profile that contains the default 
settings.
When you make changes to your site, load up each browser and surf through 
your site. Are there navigational elements that are not loading? Check out on your site 
(or complete all conversion activities); are there some actions you cannot accomplish?
There are also services, such as AnyBrowser.com (http://anybrowser.com/­
siteviewer.html) or Browser Shots (http://browsershots.org/), that help you see your 
site in different browsers. There is no substitute to having someone check your site in 
an actual browser, but sometimes these services are useful if you do not have multiple 
operating systems (especially for mobile devices and tablets) or computer types (such as 
a Mac) in your office.

■  Em ploy i ng Usa bi li t y, T rust, a n d W eb T ech nology 
169
In addition, often a developer browser version is launched before the final public 
version. Your design team can test your website in new versions—before your custom-
ers think your site is broken. 
Enhancing Browser Functionality: Flash, Java, and Plug-ins
Most plug-ins are optional. Installing Firefox does not mean your computer suddenly 
has PDF support. Adobe Flash, for example, is essential for seeing graphics on particu-
lar websites (Figure 5.13). But ask yourself: Do your visitors want to see the graphics 
enough to install something unknown on their computer?
Figure 5.13  Apollo 11 Lunar landing celebration page without Flash installed
Most users will not install additional software to view a page. In some cases, it 
could be that their browser does not support particular plug-ins (especially on a mobile 
device or iPad). Other users do not trust plug-ins because they don’t know what side 
effects they might encounter with their computer or browser. Rather than extend the 
functionality of their browsers, these users are cautious and no amount of cajoling 
will ever get them to install a plug-in. It is just as easy for these users to find similar 
products or services on a different site. This is where your analytics system can let you 
know how many of your visitors do not have Flash, Java, or other plug-ins installed. If 
your website uses plug-ins, and even 10 percent of your users do not have support for 
those plug-ins, you are immediately lowering the number of possible conversions on 
your website.

It is also important to note that robots (programs that search engines use to 
index the Web) have only a rudimentary understanding of Flash and other scripts. If 
your navigation is in all Flash or all JavaScript, a robot might not be able to index your 
entire website.
Note:  There are two plug-ins for Firefox that make it easy to view your website without certain features (such 
as Java or CSS) enabled. The first is a powerful plug-in called the Web Developer toolbar. The second is FlashBlock, 
which simply turns Flash on or off. 
I’m not saying that you should not use Flash or other plug-ins across your web-
site. Just be aware of your users’ browser capabilities to ensure they can navigate and 
convert on your website based on how your website is coded.
Is Your Website Fast for Everyone?
The numbers for U.S. broadband penetration rates vary significantly. Some studies say 
that more than 85 percent of users have broadband at home. Others claim that more 
than 50 percent of the country still does not have broadband. The issues that come into 
play that create such a wide span of statistics are broadband type (DSL, FiOS, cable), 
ISP traffic throttling, and how fast a connection has to be before it’s considered high 
speed.
Regardless of the numbers involved, the United States and Canada have a large 
number of users who are on slow networks. Typically, rural areas have slower con-
nections than urban areas, but even in urban centers, there are plenty of users on slow 
connections. In Europe, during the summer of 2013 when some large broadband stud-
ies were conducted, it was estimated that Europe has 72 percent broadband penetra-
tion, meaning more than one in four people are still on slow connections. 
Impatience is a common human trait. People with slow connections are not 
granted more patience than those on broadband connections. Therefore, you should 
consider how long it takes your site to load on all connections. Are you losing visitors 
because all your images are high resolution? They may take only a few seconds to load 
on your connection but five minutes to load on a dial-up connection.
Examine your analytics to see if you have a large percentage of visitors on slow 
connections. If 99 percent of your visitors are using broadband, it might not make 
financial sense to add another version of your website.
Securing the User’s Data: SSL Certificates
Users are becoming increasingly aware of and concerned about the security of their 
data online. If you accept personal information, especially credit cards, having an SSL 
certificate is a necessity.

■  Em ploy i ng Usa bi li t y, T rust, a n d W eb T ech nology 
171
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and the newer Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
encrypt data sent from a browser to a website so the data is harder to intercept and 
provide greater security for the users’ information. Most host providers can help you 
set up a security layer for your website. VeriSign and GeoTrust are two of the leaders in 
providing security for websites.
It is useful to not just have a security layer for your website but to also let users 
know their data is secure. This can increase users’ trust of your website and help 
increase conversion rates.
When adding secure layers, look through your website for one of the most com-
mon errors on the Web: the browser message that some content on the page is not 
secure (Figure 5.14). The error shown in Figure 5.14 is for Internet Explorer; each 
browser displays security error messages differently.
Figure 5.14  Security error warning
Usually—but by no means always—this error does not have a nefarious cause. It 
most commonly occurs when a logo or script is being rendered on a secure page from 
a nonsecure server. To fix this error, view the source of your web page (either by right-
clicking and choosing View Page Source or navigating to the View menu and choos-
ing Page Source), and look for images, scripts, and other files where the source is http 
instead of https.
The worst error is when the browser interrupts the process of loading a website, 
informs the searcher that there is an issue with the website’s security certificate, and 
asks if they want to continue (Figure 5.15). This keeps any part of the page from load-
ing until the user has made a choice. If a user sees this screen instead of your website 
after clicking on an AdWords ad, their most likely action will be to leave the website 
immediately.

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■

Data security is going to continue to be an important concern. Do not let easy-
to-fix technical issues lower your conversion rates. Keep your customers’ data safe and 
let them know that the information they send you is secure.
Is Your Information above the Fold?
What a consumer first sees in their browser when your website loads is known as 
above the fold. This is information the visitor sees without having to scroll down. It is 
your website’s first impression.
The most complex issue with the above-the-fold concept is that monitors come 
in all shapes and sizes. Some laptops have only nine-inch monitors, while some wide-
screen monitors are more than two feet wide. This creates a scenario where there is no 
definite above the fold that you can code into your website.
This is another place where your analytics system can tell you about your visi-
tors (Figure 5.16). While w3schools.com does publish statistics about the most com-
mon browser resolutions, those stats do not necessarily apply to you. If your target 
audience is business travelers, you may see some very small browser resolutions with 
the advancement of ultraportable laptops. If your audience is web developers, you may 
see some extremely large browser resolutions.
Figure 5.16  Google Analytics showing visitor browser resolutions
Harald Weinreich, Hartmut Obendorf, Eelco Herder, and Matthias Mayer in 
2006 published a paper titled Off the Beaten Tracks: Exploring Three Aspects of Web 
Navigation, in which they examined where people clicked after arriving at a website. 
Table 5.4 highlights why showcasing your most important information—especially 

■  Em ploy i ng Usa bi li t y, T rust, a n d W eb T ech nology 
173
the actions you want someone to take—at the top of your website can dramatically 
increase conversion rates.
▶
▶Table 5.4  Where users click

Since more than three-fourths of all clicks occur in the area that loads above the 
fold, you always want your call to action, major benefits, and conversion actions above 
the fold. Users do not scroll to the right. If you have a website where a user has to scroll 
horizontally to see more of your website, most visitors will never see that information.
While that study is now seven years old, the statistics are still very reliable. If 
you run full tests on your site, you will usually see that most actions are still taken 
above the fold. If you have longer pages, what usually happens is searchers will read 
the information above the fold and then scan the information below the fold. 
Note:  The Firefox add-on Firesizer or the Chrome plug-in Resolution Test allows you to see your website in 
different resolutions. These are useful plug-ins to quickly view how your website looks in different browser sizes.
The concept of above the fold is both a technical concept—it concerns your 
website’s coding—and a psychological one—it showcases human behavior and where 
consumers look for information. The proper coding and security of your website can 
increase your website’s usability and trust. These concepts can be enhanced by exam-
ining additional psychological factors that help your website convert browsers into 
buyers.
Psychological Factors That Increase Conversion Rates
It is easy to get caught up in a world of statistics that make you blind to the person 
sitting behind the computer. Stats do not pull out their credit card and buy from your 
website. You need to convince the human who is referenced in those statistics to pick 
up the phone and call your business.
Next you will see several ways your website can convey trust and usefulness to 
the user.
Testimonials and Reviews Lead to Sociability
There are two truths about humans that have been proven over and over again in studies:
••
People act differently when they are alone than in a group.
••
People conform to those around them.

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
174
Often the word conform is taken harshly, but try these two experiments and see 
what happens:
••
During a face-to-face conversation, keep looking over someone’s shoulder at 
something in the distance.
••
Stand in the middle of your office (or on a street corner) and stare up.
How long did it take for someone to stop and try to determine where you were 
looking? Humans are social creatures, and we want to feel included within the group 
around us.
Browsing the Web is an isolated activity. Rarely do searchers sit on the couch 
with a group of friends and search for information. Rarely do searchers have some-
one sitting next to them telling them where to click next or to scroll down the page. 
Therefore, you need to find ways to make the solitary activity of browsing the Web 
more social and instill a sense of being included in a group; doing so can change the 
way people feel about your site. The most common example of this is the use of tes-
timonials and reviews. These items are closely related because they are the words of 
actual people who have used a product or a company’s services.
When reading reviews or testimonials, people are no longer alone. They no lon-
ger have to form an opinion about a website by themselves. Now a searcher can incor-
porate the opinions of others in forming their decision about a product or service that 
your company offers.
Featuring testimonials or reviews on your landing pages or the page where 
someone is making a decision about using your service (or buying your product) often 
leads to higher conversion rates.
Note:  Be careful about using fake reviews or testimonials. The old axiom about “if something looks too good 
to be true, it usually is” also applies. Often reviews contain some positive and some negative information. People 
have different writing styles, and the adjectives and phrases used in reviews should vary accordingly. It is generally 
easy to spot fake reviews. This can hurt your credibility more than not having reviews in the first place. In addition, 
there have recently been lawsuits against sites posting fake reviews since these are against advertising laws in most 
countries, so fake reviews and testimonials can end up with you having to defend your site in court.
Testimonials are usually positive, but allowing some testimonials that contain 
both positive and negative information shows that you are human like everyone else. 
This is something to test, not just blindly incorporate. For example, a testimonial 
might say, “Phil’s Accounting Service did our taxes quickly and saved us a couple thou-
sand dollars, but they are slow to respond on the phone and prefer communicating via 
email or in person.” There will be some people who do not care that Phil is slow on the 
phone, because they prefer email communication. In this case, the negative information 
that made the review seem honest is actually positive for some people. Other searchers 

■  Em ploy i ng Usa bi li t y, T rust, a n d W eb T ech nology 
175
will just like the fact that Phil saved people some money and will want to see how Phil 
can help them.
You can also incorporate social media elements such as Facebook likes and 
shares, Google +1s, and tweets. However, there is no substitute for actual testimonials 
on a page no matter how many people “liked” your company.
Just remember, your primary goals are to ensure that your visitor feels part of 
a group and to raise your conversion rates. If your reviews and testimonials are not 
changing conversion rates, you need to examine why that is happening. We all like to 
feel included. Utilizing testimonials, reviews, or other social aspects in your website 
can help turn a solitary decision into an easier one as the searcher joins a group that 
has already enjoyed using your company.
Associations: What Company Do You Keep?
Many industries have governing bodies, associations, and networks that are well rec-
ognized within that particular industry. Showing which associations you are a member 
of is another way to instill trust in your visitors. You may be able to go beyond just 
showing your associations to why you are a market leader. Include any awards received 
within your field, speaking engagements, press clippings, and other demonstrations of 
authority to your visitors.
For example, at this point you have read almost five entire chapters of this book, 
yet you know little about the author. If I were to show just a small sample of associa-
tions and statements that I have been able to use over the past few years for myself or 
companies I have worked for, the list would look something like this:

Spent more than 2,000 hours in the past four years speaking to groups of

entrepreneurship. 
By now, most readers will have a different opinion of the material they are read-
ing based on the author’s authority. This is due to our ever-changing expectations 
based on the information we have with which to make decisions. While I listed many 
associations, there is no mention of any business I’ve worked with or worked for; it is 
only a list that helps to gain trust.
It can be useful to also show your partnerships and featured clients. Most 
people will assume that if a company chose to work with you, that company did 
their due diligence in researching your company before engaging your services. This 
statement is even truer if the featured client is a well-known business. Most people 
assume that Amazon does more research than Joe’s Used Books in choosing a part-
ner. Essentially, there is transference of trust from the featured client or partner to 
your business.
People are also visual, and images instead of just bullet points can quickly show 
your authority. If you can use association seals or images, they can help break up the 
text on the page with subtle reminders of your authority. 
Finally, this authority also works with companies and company logos. Here is a 
small sample of companies that I have worked with or that attended some of my train-
ings (Figure 5.17).
The goal is for visitors to be able to examine your company and quickly find 
reasons why you are a better company to engage with than your competitors. If you 
have symbols of authority, or memberships in organizations such as the Better Business 
Bureau or Chamber of Commerce, test using them on your website.
Using Coupons or Discounts
A common marketing tactic is to offer coupons or discounts. If you use either of these 
items in the ad copy, make sure you also show the same offers on your landing page.

■  Em ploy i ng Usa bi li t y, T rust, a n d W eb T ech nology 
177
Figure 5.17  Sample companies Brad Geddes has taught or worked with over the years
It is common to see a discount code listed in an ad. The user clicks to the land-
ing page and does not see the discount code. They navigate through the site, add items 
to the shopping cart, and go to checkout. If they cannot remember the code, they often 
go back to the search engine to try and find the code. If the searcher cannot find the 
same ad again, they can become frustrated and may abandon the cart completely.
Reinforcing the discount code on the landing page, or even adding the code to a 
navigational frame so that it stays with the user throughout that visit, can help increase 
conversion rates. The visitor will not have to abandon the shopping cart to find the 
coupon.
Using coupons is also a way to track in-store shopping. If you have both a physi-
cal store and an online store, it can be difficult to see your marketing effectiveness. By 
tracking in-store coupon redemption from your AdWords visitors, you can start to see 
if your AdWords campaigns are driving visitors into your store.
The end of 2008 saw a higher increase in searches for coupons and discount 
codes than previous months, and that trend has continued for several years due to 
both the economy and the ease of finding coupons on the Web. In a down economy, 
consumers become more price conscious. By not only advertising discounts but buying 
those keywords on your products (discount TV, TV coupon), you can bring additional 
visitors to your website.
Using coupons is also a way to increase customer loyalty. If you have an email 
marketing list, make sure you showcase your coupons in your newsletters. Consumers 
like deals. The deals could be for a coupon, free newsletter, free consultation, or special 

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
178
discount. Find unique ways to give your customers a deal, and they will reward you 
with more orders.
Using Images to Direct a Consumer’s Focus
People are drawn to images of other people—that is a well-known fact. We are com-
pelled to not just look at images of people but to look closely at their faces. Earlier in 
this chapter, you saw how if you look behind someone while talking to them, the per-
son will turn and look at where you are looking. The same thing happens on the Web 
with images of people. If you have a face on your website, searchers will follow the eyes 
in the picture to see where they are looking.
If your image is at the bottom-right corner of the page, often consumers will 
skip your text content to look at the image. If the image is then looking down and to 
the right—where if you drew a line from the eyes they would be looking off the moni-
tor onto the desk—the searchers’ eyes will no longer be on your website but distracted 
by elements on their desk.
Make sure that if you use faces on your website the image is looking back into 
your content at either your major benefits or the Submit button, where you want them 
to take action. Images are excellent to use on websites because they break up the 
monotony of text. However, you must make sure that the image is enhancing your con-
version rates and not distracting your visitors.
Coding for Color Blindness
Approximately 8–10 percent of males have problems distinguishing between red and green. Another 
1–2 percent of the population has problems perceiving the difference between blue and yellow. Less 
than 1 percent of women suffer from any form of color blindness.
Examining your site in grayscale can allow you to determine whether your text can be read against 
your background. If you use red text and a green background, some might only see a gray page with 
no visible text. 
Additionally, never rely on just color-based instructions, such as “click the red button to proceed.” 
Always label website elements.
What Color Is Your Website?
The subtle use of color is another way to subconsciously influence your visitors. Here 
are some common color associations:
••
Green conveys trust or money.
••
Red conveys aggressiveness.
••
Blue is calming.
••
Black and white are neutral colors.

■  Em ploy i ng Usa bi li t y, T rust, a n d W eb T ech nology 
179
However, even within colors there are variations of meaning. Deep purple is 
associated with royalty and riches whereas light purple is romantic. Experimenting 
with color on your website can lead to combinations that are highly effective; just be 
careful with your meanings.
Red might seem like a good color for a DUI attorney since they need to go in 
and fight. Red is probably not a good color for an estate planning attorney. Green con-
veys both trust and money, which is a good color if you are a nonprofit trying to attract 
donations, but it might make you seem expensive if you are selling stocks.
You must also be careful with overuse of a color. Looking at blue for too long 
can cause one to go from a calm state to almost a depressed state (that’s why it’s called 
“the blues”).
White works well with any other color, and it is easy to read black text on a 
white background. In general, you do not want to overdo background colors where 
someone must spend a lot of time reading. A poorly chosen color scheme can doom 
your website to failure. In the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, most users 
prefer light background colors, with other colors used to denote different aspects of a 
website (such as sidebars, navigation bars, and headers). Most websites should not be 
bold and sparkly, but that is not always true if you are trying to reach a younger demo-
graphic, for example. This is why it’s important to test different color schemes (more 
about testing in Chapter 15).
Beyond just your website’s navigation bar and sidebars, experiment with the 
color of your Submit button. A red Submit button on a white and blue page stands out 
from all other elements. If your page only has one or two conversion activities, using a 
different color for those actions can help those items draw visitors’ eyes.
Buttons vs. Text Links for Conversion Activities
Most websites have several links on any one page. If your call to action is also a link, it 
can get lost in the myriad of other links and text on the page. A button stands out from 
the rest of a page, making it more effective than a text link, and it invites the visitor to 
take action. 
Consider the three possible links shown in Figure 5.18. Which stands out the 
most to you?
Figure 5.18  Button and text links
If you use buttons, use only one or two on a page. You do not want to overuse 
them so they no longer stand out. Changing your main actions (such as add to cart, 

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
180
check out, subscribe, download, and so on) from a link to a button should have an 
effect on conversion rates.
Privacy Policies
Privacy policies are at a crossroads in several countries. In the United States, a privacy 
policy is not always required (please note that in some states it is required). However, 
once you create a privacy policy it becomes a legal document that you must follow. 
This is a general statement and not necessarily true for all industries and company 
types. Some companies, such as public, private, and governmental, have different 
requirements in many countries than a typical small business website. In some coun-
tries privacy policies are mandatory. In others you must have a cookie policy in addi-
tion to a privacy policy. Understanding your country and local laws is essential to 
making sure you are following the proper policy procedures for how you are governed.
Adding a privacy policy can be a difficult choice for a company to make if they 
are in an area where one is not required. There will be users who look for a privacy 
policy before submitting their information. If you wish to maximize your conver-
sion rates, adding a privacy policy should help. In addition, one of Google’s mantras 
for websites is transparency to the user. Google suggests that websites have privacy 
policies. They require them for AdSense publishers but not for advertisers. However, 
Google does require that if you collect personal information you inform the user how 
it will be used. It does not have to be a separate document, but the information must 
be on the page or linked to in a privacy policy. Falling in line with Google’s guidelines 
often leads to higher quality scores.
Your privacy policy could state, “We will sell your data to anyone who is willing 
to buy it.” Now, that might not increase conversion rates for those who read it, but if 
you are trying to be transparent to the user, at least they know what will happen if they 
give you their email address.
Everyone is concerned about spam these days. Most searchers want empathy and 
reassurance more than they want to read through an entire privacy policy. Just by add-
ing a small message to your Submit button (Figure 5.19), you can help reassure your 
visitors that they will not end up with spam from your company.
Figure 5.19  Add empathy and a benefit to your Submit button.
Your Website’s Usability Goals
Many books are available that are devoted to website usability. There is no way to 
cover all of the possible tricks and elements in just one chapter. I have also examined 

■  Be st Pr ac t ice s for L a n di ng Page s
181
conversion elements such as associations (and you will learn more about increasing 
conversions in the next chapter). What you should take away is that your website 
should accomplish these tasks:
••
Allow the customer to find the answer to their question
••
Allow the searcher to easily find information about your products and services
••
Allow the customer to be able to access that information regardless of their 
browser, operating system, or eyesight
••
Instill a sense of trust
••
Showcase your authority
••
Protect the privacy and data of your customers
••
Make the conversion process easy
If your website can accomplish these goals, you can engage the customer and 
hold their attention. This is the first step to increasing conversion rates: making sure 
your website is accessible, readable, and trustworthy. If you cannot accomplish these 
three actions, the quality of your services and products do not matter, because search-
ers will not stay on your website long enough to learn more about your offerings.
Your landing page is the first impression a visitor has about your website. 
Therefore, you should closely examine the usability and conversion paths of your land-
ing page. Most websites are not a single page, so incorporating these elements over 
your entire website is also a must for increasing your website’s effectiveness.
Best Practices for Landing Pages
Devising the right landing pages is a crucial technique for converting searchers into 
buyers. A misstep here can send potential customers back to square one or to rival sites. 
The following are issues that you must address to enhance your potential for success:
••
Make sure that your landing page answers the searcher’s questions—not the 
search query itself, but the searcher’s need to know whether your site can fulfill 
their needs.
••
Craft the destination URL to comply with Google’s editorial policy and to add 
additional tracking information that you can utilize to see how AdWords visitors 
navigate and convert on your website.
••
Send the user to a page on your site that is the farthest logical page within the 
buying funnel for your website or a page dedicated to the search query.
••
Correctly directing AdWords traffic is crucial. To do so, you need to under-
stand the different types of user queries: transactional, informational, and 
navigational.

Chapter 5:  Cr e at i ng L a n di ng Page s T h at Con v ert Se a rch ers i n to Bu y ers  ■
182
••
Your site must be user friendly and trustworthy in the mind of your potential 
customer. You can accomplish these goals by understanding web technologies 
and using those technologies to your advantage.
••
Use testimonials, reviews, and certifications to show that not only can your web-
site be trusted, but your business can be trusted as well.
By using the techniques in this chapter, you will be able to achieve a good con-
version rate. In the next chapter, I will examine techniques for bringing more visitors to 
your site and ways of increasing the conversions of those who view your landing pages 
and interact with your website.

Optimizing for Traffic
The most common analytics metrics to examine for any website are total page views 
and unique visitors. How many different people visited your website? How many page 
views did those visitors generate? These metrics are useful because they give a high-
level picture of your website’s visibility.
Although these are common metrics for website measurement, they can also be 
applied to any AdWords advertising campaign. How often were your ads shown (ad 
impressions), how often were they clicked, and how engaged were those visitors with 
your website (page views or conversion rates)?
These numbers are important because they will direct you to the type of traffic 
optimization you need. If you have a good click-through rate (CTR)—clicks divided by 
impressions—you need more impressions. If you have plenty of impressions but very 
few clicks, you need to raise your CTR.
Publishers are often paid per page view by selling cost per thousand impressions 
(CPM) ads. In that case, a conversion can be counted for each page view, and increas-
ing page views per visitor has a direct influence on the site’s profitability.
You might also find increasing page views useful if you have an e-commerce or a 
local business website, especially if you have one customer recruit another to visit your 
website, or if you want more total visitors to see your offerings. These viral characteris-
tics can result in multiple customers from a single click on one of your ads.
First, we will look at techniques for increasing traffic to the website. Then we 
will examine various methods designed to help you generate even more traffic from a 
single click.
Exploring Strategies to Show Your Ads More Often
Before you can determine how to receive more ad impressions, you need to know why 
your ad is not being shown in the first place.
The first setting to examine is your daily budget. If you are spending your entire 
daily budget every single day, odds are you are capping your impressions due to budget 
limitations. In this case, you have two options:
Raise Your Daily Budget  If you raise your daily budget, your ads should be shown more 
often. Your CPC (cost per click) and cost per conversion should remain stable.
Lower Your Bids  If you lower your bids, your ads may receive more impressions and clicks 
for the same budget. This is not a guarantee, since some of your keywords may not 
have a high enough CPC to be displayed on page 1, which will end up lowering your 
total impressions.
If your goal is to increase ad impressions and your average ad position is 5 or 
better, it is usually best to lower your CPCs to get more impressions. If your average 

■  Op t i m i zi ng for T r a f f ic
185
position is below the 5th position, lowering your CPCs may or may not gather more 
impressions. This average position is a rough guideline, because sometimes there are 12 
ads on a page, and other times there may be a maximum of 8 depending on how many 
ads are shown above the organic results (more about the premium ad slots when we 
discuss Quality Score in Chapter 7, “Demystifying Quality Score”).
Note:  The two most common factors that limit ad exposure are ad scheduling (Chapter 13, “Devising 
Profitable Bid Strategies”) and geographic settings (Chapter 11, “Utilizing Advanced Geographic Targeting 
Techniques”). If you have chosen to only show your ads between 1:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. in Fargo, North Dakota, for 
example, you will not see many impressions.
When you lower bids, there is no guarantee that your conversion rate or cost per 
conversion will stay the same. If you do not want to spend more but want to receive 
more clicks, then lowering bids is useful. However, daily budget is the most common 
reason your ad is not being shown. If you are not reaching your daily budget, or would 
like more information about why your ads are not being shown even if you are reach-
ing your daily budget, the first step is to run the impression share report.
Creating and Reading an Impression Share Report
The impression share report is the name the industry has adopted for one of the 
AdWords reports. This report tells you the percentage of times your ad was shown 
when it was eligible to be shown and the reasons it was not displayed. For instance, 
if you set your ad to be shown only between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. then the search 
impression share report will only report on available search impressions during that 
one-hour time period. Even though your ad scheduling limitations means you will only 
get 1/24th of all search impressions available across the whole day, the purpose of the 
search impression report is to tell you how visible your ads are when they are supposed 
to be running according to your scheduling. Impression share reports are available for 
both search and display, and the data can be viewed at campaign, ad group, and key-
word levels for most of the reports.
To create this report for search campaigns, navigate to the Campaigns tab and 
customize your columns (Figure 6.1). Then, in the Competitive Metrics category, select 
these fields:
••
Search Impr. Share
••
Search Exact Match IS
••
Search Lost IS (Rank)
••
Search Lost IS (Budget)

(Figure 6.2).

Impression Share Report for the Display Network
Impression share reports are also available for the display network by following the same steps and 
selecting the Display Impression Share options shown in Figure 6.1. One additional report available 
for display ads is Relative CTR. This is your CTR in relation to your competitors’. A 1 means your CTR 
is roughly the same as your competitors’, anything below 1 means your CTR is worse than your com-
petitors’, and anything above 1 means your CTR is better than your competitors’. If you are trying to 
increase your ad exposure on the display network and your relative CTR is lower than your competi-
tors’, then you will often want to first start your optimization with ad testing.
You will see your typical interface and other data columns along with the 
impression share statistics. Each row represents a different campaign. Search Impr. 
(Impression) Share (IS) represents the percentage of time your ads were shown. In this 
instance, the ads were only shown from less than 10 percent to 54 percent of the time 
when they were eligible to be shown. Eligible to be shown means the number of times 
the searcher could have seen your ad, based on your campaign’s ad scheduling choices, 
network options, keyword choices, and geography.
When your impression share is 85 to 95 percent or above, depending on how 
many advertisers are in your industry it is difficult—sometimes impossible—to raise 
your impression share. This is due to the sheer number of ads and advertisers Google is 
trying to serve.
Search Lost IS (Rank) shows the percentage of times your ads were not shown 
because of your rank—your ad’s position. If your ad position was too low to be shown 
on page 1 and the user did not go to page 2, your ad lost its impression due to its rank 
being too low. In this case, raising your Quality Score (see Chapter 7) or your bids is 
one of the few ways to receive these impressions. There are situations where you might 
always lose some impressions due to rank.
To illustrate a situation in which you might lose impression share even if your 
average position is 1, consider this scenario:
••
The Google search network partner shows only two ads.
••
The keyword is ultracompetitive only in Miami.
Advertisers in Miami bid 500 percent higher than other areas for this keyword. 
Micro-situations like this exist, and trying to track down areas where you are only 
losing a few percentage points of rank might not be worth your time—even if you 
found where you were losing impressions, you still might not raise your bid to a profit-
able level.

Chapter 6:  Le a r n i ng A dva nced Op t i m i zat ion T ech n iqu e s  ■
188
The Search Lost IS (Budget) column shows the percentage of time that your ads 
were not shown because your daily budget was too low. Once your daily budget is 
exhausted, your ad no longer shows for that day. If you are consistently reaching your 
daily budget, consider raising it to receive more impressions.
If you cannot raise your budget, and you mostly lose impressions due to budget 
issues, you are overbidding. Consider this scenario: Your lost impression share due to 
budget is more than 30, your daily budget is $100, and you are receiving 100 clicks 
a day. Therefore, your average CPC is $1. If you were to lower your average CPC to 
0.75, you could potentially receive 133 clicks for the same budget. There comes a point 
where lowering your CPC will not get you more clicks because your rank will fall too 
low. However, if you are capped by budget, you should first remove your least profit-
able keywords. Assuming you still can spend your entire budget on the keywords that 
are left, you will want to start lowering your CPCs to the point where you can get the 
most clicks possible for your budget.
You can examine this data at either the campaign, ad group, or keyword level. 
The one difference between these various levels is that you cannot see Search Lost 
Impression Share (Budget) at the keyword or ad group level because these levels do not 
have a budget associated to them; budgets are at the campaign level.
To get an idea of the lowest bid you can use and still maintain page 1 position, 
examine the page 1 bids (Figure 6.3) and top of page bids.
Figure 6.3  First page bids
The first page bid is the minimum amount you need to bid to be on page 1 of 
the search results for the majority of the geographies where you are advertising. The 
top of page bid is the minimum amount you need to bid to keep your bid at the top of 
the page in the premium positions. There is often a large click-through-rate difference 
between top of page and side of page CTRs. To see this information for yourself, click 
the Segment button and then choose Top vs. Other; then you can see the difference in 
your CTRs by Google and search partners for your ad positions (Figure 6.4).

■  Op t i m i zi ng for T r a f f ic
189
Figure 6.4  Top vs. Other CTRs
If you have a high daily budget that is rarely reached, and you see that you are 
losing impressions due to budget, there are a couple other common possibilities:
••
The keyword was in the news and created an unusually high search activity for 
that keyword.
••
Your keyword’s search volume changes based on day of the week or month, and 
that’s the only time you are losing impressions.
In these scenarios, try running the impression share report over different time 
periods and then comparing the reports. You may see some days or months where your 
ad is shown much more often than other periods of time.
The Search Lost IS (Budget), Lost IS (Rank), and Impr. Share (IS) columns 
should total 100 percent.
Search Exact Match IS is a bit tricky to work with because it might not be 
overly actionable. It is useful only within the context of your keywords, match types, 
and goals. Exact match impression share is how often your ads show if all your key-
words are set to exact match. The higher this number, the more impressions you would 
receive if you added phrase or broad match variations of your keywords.
The One-Minute Account Visibility Diagnosis
An account loses visibility due to budget or rank. If the problem is budget, you need to raise your budget 
or lower your CPCs to receive more clicks. The other reason your ads are not displayed is because of rank. If 
most of your impressions are lost due to rank, examine the percentage of your impressions at each Quality 
Score level. If most of your impressions are for Quality Score 5 or lower, that means you need to raise the 
Quality Score to get more impressions. If most of your impressions are at Quality Score 6 or higher, you 
need to raise your bids to receive more impressions. We will show you how to do this analysis in Chapter 7.

Chapter 6:  Le a r n i ng A dva nced Op t i m i zat ion T ech n iqu e s  ■

When examining your share of voice, or online visibility, the first place to start 
is learning how often your ads are not being shown due to the limitations you have 
put on your account. If your ads are not being shown due to rank or budget, those are 
easy-to-diagnose constraints. If your impression share report shows that your ads are 
being shown most of the time, the only way to increase your impressions is to add new 
keywords or expand your time of day or geographic reach.
Instead of trying to get new impressions, what if your ad is being shown and you 
want more clicks from those impressions? The second way to optimize for more clicks 
is not to get more impressions but to make better use of the impressions you are receiv-
ing by increasing your CTR.
Taking Advantage of Dynamic Keyword Insertion
When someone does a search on Google, their search query is bolded in both ad copy 
and organic results on the search results page. In general, when your keyword is in the 
ad copy (and therefore bolded), it draws more attention and your ad receives a higher 
CTR. Wouldn’t it be fantastic to be able to automatically insert the searcher’s query 
into your ad copy? This is almost what dynamic keyword insertion accomplishes.
When your ad is shown, it is because a keyword in your account triggered that 
ad to be displayed. With dynamic keyword insertion, you can automatically insert the 
keyword that caused your ad to be displayed in the ad copy. For example:
••
Your account has the broad match keyword computer memory.
••
Your account does not have the keyword laptop computer memory.
••
Someone searches for laptop computer memory.
••
This search triggers your keyword computer memory to display an ad.
••
Since the keyword computer memory was what triggered the ad, that keyword 
would be inserted into your ad copy.
••
If your account had the keyword laptop computer memory in it, the searcher 
would have seen their keyword query inserted into the ad copy.
If all of your keywords are exact match, you are inserting the searcher’s keyword 
into every single ad. Since you will most likely be using different match types, you are 
inserting the closest match in your account.
There are a few restrictions to using dynamic keyword insertion. The first is that 
the ad copy must still follow editorial rules. If the keyword is trademarked and you are 
not authorized to use it in your ads for legal reasons, dynamic keyword insertion is not 
permitted. Sometimes DKI ads will slip through editorial review filters and go online, 
but once they are discovered, the ad will be disapproved. This is also true for alterna-
tive capitalization and misspellings of the trademarked keyword.

What’s in a Name?
Google did not publicly acknowledge dynamic keyword insertion when the feature was first released, 
since it was meant for internal use. Because it was not recognized by Google, the community ended up 
choosing the name dynamic keyword insertion (which was influenced by some Googlers who privately 
talked about the feature).
Both Yahoo! and Microsoft released public information about this feature on their systems before 
Google finally acknowledged that the feature existed. Google chose to name the feature keyword 
insertion; however, by that time the term dynamic keyword insertion (commonly referred to as DKI) was 
so ingrained that the official label is rarely used. Suffice it to say, DKI is keyword insertion, which is 
also called dynamic keyword insertion, and whenever you hear someone mention any of these names, 
they all refer to the same feature.
Several options are available for how to display the inserted keywords in your 
ad, and understanding the capitalization is essential to creating effective keyword 
insertion ads.
How to Create Keyword Insertion Ads
To create a keyword insertion ad, you replace part of the ad copy with a special syntax 
that denotes that the keyword should be inserted into a specific section of the ad. Along 
with denoting where the keyword will be inserted, you need to define what will show 
if the keyword cannot be inserted (such as trademarks, misspellings, or exceptionally 
long keywords).
For instance, if you allocate the entire headline to keyword insertion but the 
keyword is 30 characters long, the keyword cannot be inserted into the ad copy since 
the headline is limited to 25 characters. Therefore, you also specify text that shows if 
the keyword cannot be inserted into the ad copy.
The syntax is very straightforward: insert {keyword:Backup Text} into any part 
of your ad copy, replacing Backup Text with what you would like to see in your ad 
copy if the keyword could not be inserted. Figure 6.5 shows several examples of key-
word insertion in ad copy. With keyword insertion, you can accomplish the following:
••
Allocate an entire line to keyword insertion
••
Allocate only part of a line to keyword insertion
••
Add keyword insertion into any line of ad copy
••
Use keyword insertion in multiple lines
••
Add keyword insertion into the display URL

Chapter 6:  Le a r n i ng A dva nced Op t i m i zat ion T ech n iqu e s  ■
192
Figure 6.5  Examples of dynamic keyword insertion
When a keyword is inserted into the ad copy, the words Backup Text will not 
appear, having been replaced by the inserted keyword.
The secret to keyword insertion is the way the word keyword in the ad copy is 
capitalized (see Table 6.1). This only applies for the way you write keyword in the ad 
copy—the way you capitalize your actual keywords in each ad group does not matter 
for keyword insertion.

A Note on Keyword Insertion
Be careful when using keyword insertion: often companies become lazy and either forget the rules 
of successful organization or write some very poor ads. If you ever seen ads where the capitalization 
seems incorrect (acronyms such as TV spelled Tv or ROI spelled Roi) or the word order seems wrong 
(such as TV Sony), this is often due to lazy use of keyword insertion.
There is a nice tool (created by the technical editor for this book, Matt Van Wagner) called the DEKE, 
the Dynamic Keyword Insertion Simulator, that will allow you to see 1) how your keywords will look 
within your ads and 2) fail rates for DKI insertion based on keyword lengths and other variables. You 
can find the tool at http://dki-ads.com.
Keyword insertion is one of the few times when the order of the words in your 
account matters (excluding match type, where it is very important). If you are creating 
keyword lists and have the keyword TV Sony in your ad group, TV Sony will appear in 

■  Op t i m i zi ng for T r a f f ic
193
your keyword insertion ad and not the more commonly stated Sony TV. Poorly formed 
keyword insertion ads can lower your CTR.
When using dynamic keyword insertion, keep a second ad in the same ad group 
that does not use the feature to see which one receives the higher CTR. It is useful to 
test keyword insertion versus non–keyword insertion ads, because it is common to see 
search results where all the ads start to look the same (Figure 6.6).
Figure 6.6  Does your ad stand out from the crowd?
The use of keyword insertion in this search result is not the issue. The larger 
problem is that the ads blend together because the headlines are so similar. In this case, 
writing a different ad that stands out can dramatically increase the CTR.
If your ad was among those in Figure 6.6 and you wanted to use keyword inser-
tion, you could move the feature to the second or third line of ad copy. This way the 
word is still bolded in the ad copy, but you could write a headline that stands out from 
the crowd and increases your CTR.
Keyword insertion is fantastic if you have thousands of part numbers and do 
not want to create thousands of ad copy versions to show the actual part number. 
However, keyword insertion is not always the best ad feature for your account. While 
keyword insertion might increase the CTR, do not forget the conversion rate. If you are 
a publisher being paid per page view, dynamic keyword insertion will probably work 
well. If you are selling a product, you need to measure if your keyword insertion ads 
have different conversion rates than your other ads. More visitors are not useful if it 
leads to fewer conversions.
Please note that the use of keyword insertion does not automatically increase 
your Quality Score. (We will discuss Quality Score in the next chapter.) The ad (after 
keyword insertion) is used in determining a keyword’s Quality Score, so it might have a 
slight effect on increasing your Quality Score, but the larger effect on Quality Score is 

Chapter 6:  Le a r n i ng A dva nced Op t i m i zat ion T ech n iqu e s  ■
194
usually from an increase in CTR. CTR is the largest component of Quality Score, and 
if your keyword insertion ad receives a higher CTR, this will help your Quality Score.
Keyword insertion works on both the search and display networks. For the 
search network, the keyword inserted is straightforward; it’s the one that triggered 
your ad to show.
On the display network, keyword insertion is more ambiguous. On the display 
network, the keyword that is inserted into your ad is the one that Google determines 
is the most likely to trigger your ad for that particular page. For example, say your ad 
group contained these keywords:
••
Plumber
••
Kitchen remodeling
••
Fixing showers
If a user were reading a news article about the increase in home owners remod-
eling their kitchens and bathrooms for resale, the most likely match for that article 
would be the keyword kitchen remodeling. Therefore, your keyword insertion ad 
would use the keyword kitchen remodeling in your ad copy for that particular page. 
If your keyword list contained both the keywords kitchen remodeling and bathroom 
remodeling, either of those could be inserted into the ad copy.
On a content page, your keyword may or may not be contained within the arti-
cle. Therefore, it is common to see very different response rates for the keyword inser-
tion feature across display and search. We will cover the display network in Chapter 9, 
“Understanding the Display Network,” but this is another example of why you should 
always separate out search and display reporting.
Keyword insertion can be a powerful tool when used correctly. The ability to 
automatically add keywords into the ad copy can help increase your ad’s relevance 
to the consumer. However, when used poorly, a keyword insertion ad can lower 
your CTR.
Keyword insertion can help make better use of your current impressions. Instead 
of finding new keywords, if you increase your CTR on your existing keywords, you 
will receive more visitors to your website. Once someone has clicked on your ad and 
visited your site, how do you increase the number of pages each searcher visits?
Increasing Page Views
With Google AdWords, you pay every time someone visits your website. Although this 
can be a very profitable endeavor, finding ways of increasing the page views from each 
visitor or even having a visitor bring someone else to your site for free can increase 
your profits and site visibility.
E-commerce companies are often focused on return on investment (ROI) and 
not page views. This focus can lead to creating landing pages dedicated to a single 

■  Op t i m i zi ng for T r a f f ic
195
product where the page does not offer any navigation except to add an item to a shop-
ping cart. If you only have one product on the landing page and the searcher does not 
want that product, their only option is to click the Back button and leave your site. 
When optimizing for page views, always consider the options—or lack of options—
that you present to searchers.
The other consideration is that when surfing the Web, searchers often do not 
know what to do next. They have read a page of content, or looked at a product and 
decided they do not want it, so what is the next thing they should do on your website?
There are two main ways to increase page views:
••
Give the reader additional or related information.
••
Have the reader send information to a friend that there is content they will enjoy 
on the website.
These two ways can be broken down into several techniques:
Related Articles  If someone reads an entire article on your website, they are generally 
interested in that topic. Give the reader related articles where they can continue learn-
ing more. If your site is a news site, usually you want your related articles based on the 
same overall story or a top story section. If it is an informational article, the timeliness 
of the articles generally does not matter as long as the information is related, assuming 
the content is timeless.
Related and Supporting Products  In the grocery store, as you are waiting to check out, there 
are many last-minute impulse items you can add to your shopping cart. On the Web, 
there is no last-minute aisle that features candy, gum, and magazines. Each page of 
your website can be customized with impulse items and last-minute related products.
Showcase your related and ancillary products across your product pages. You can also 
use this tactic to engage a user who is in the learning phase of the buying funnel. If 
someone is interested in purchasing an iPod, they may not know if they want an iPod 
Touch, a 160 GB iPod, or a Nano. Help the user easily navigate between the related 
products or show a comparison of all the products on a single page.
This is also true for supporting products. If the iPod is being purchased as a gift, 
many users will also want to give an iTunes gift card along with the iPod. By showing 
additional products, you can increase not only your page views but often your average 
order amount as well.
Recommended Articles  Have you created an authoritative set of informational articles? 
Do you have some articles that readers absolutely love? Put these articles in a recom-
mended article section. This not only helps increase the page views on your website but 
also showcases your best writing so that users will have a higher level of trust for your 
content.

Chapter 6:  Le a r n i ng A dva nced Op t i m i zat ion T ech n iqu e s  ■
196
Recommended Products  You are the authority on your website. Searchers look to a website 
to guide them. If they are unsure about what to buy, a recommended product section 
can help put them on track toward a checkout. Often gift buyers have no idea what to 
purchase for another person. By organizing your products by age, price, gender, and 
so on, you can create a recommended buying section to help a user narrow their gift 
options.
Buying Guides  Have you ever bought a camcorder, laptop, or high-definition TV? The 
different types of technologies, displays, recording devices, and acronyms associated 
with buying these products are staggering. Creating a how-to buying guide, or recom-
mendation wizard, can not only increase page views but also help your site become an 
authority in a specific area. If you have the best resources for determining how to buy 
a particular product, showcase these resources so others will find them and tell their 
friends.
Top-Read Articles and Top-Selling Products  It is commonly noted that we live in a world of 
fads. From choosing a watch because a celebrity is wearing it to reading a news article 
that everyone is discussing in the break room, people want to be included. One way 
you can incorporate these desires on your website is to show the top-read articles and 
top-selling products.
Highest Reviewed Articles and Products  Do you let users rate your articles or products? Do 
you allow users to write reviews that you show on your pages? If so, take advantage of 
that content by showcasing the highest reviewed pages or products of your site.
Breaking Long Articles into Multiple Pages  If your goal is page views and you write very long 
articles, break the content into multiple pages. This is especially useful if you sell CPM 
ads on your site and are looking to maximize page views.
Search Box  If you have been online for more than 10 years, you remember the days when 
the best navigation was drilling down through the Yahoo! directory to find the proper 
category and then finally a website. Today, there is an entire generation that does not 
even look for navigation but starts the browsing behavior within the search box.
Regardless of how your site is designed, incorporating a search box into your website 
will increase not only page views but functionality and user satisfaction as well. When 
you incorporate your search box, remember to track the words being used to search. 
These are not only good keywords for your search campaign, but if you see frequent 
searches from particular pages, they can be a sign that the page is lacking some critical 
information.
In addition, you can use your search query data as free market research. If consum-
ers are searching for a product that you do not have, you might consider adding it. Of 
course, if you do not offer certain products, those words may also be good negative 
keyword candidates for your account.

197
Bookmark or Save This on Social Media Sites  Just about every user knows that you can book-
mark a web page, but it is often forgotten. Adding subtle reminders, such as “book-
mark this” or “save to Delicious.com” can help get more page views from return 
visitors.
Social media sites (such as Digg, Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, and Pinterest) can 
drive a massive amount of traffic to your website. Incorporating social media tactics so 
that your content is easy to share on these sites can help you find new avenues of traffic.
It Should Be Easy to Share
Anyone can go to your site, copy the URL, go to Facebook or Twitter, paste the link and write a short 
note about the page, and then share it. However, that is several steps that you are forcing the user to 
go through to help you get more visitors and share your content.
If you care about social media mentions, put the Twitter Share button and the Facebook Like button 
directly on the website. The easier something is to do, the more likely someone is to take advantage of 
the option.
Send to a Friend  The oldest of the sharing tactics is send to a friend. If someone likes your 
site’s content, is there an easy way for them to email it to someone they think will also 
like it? While we often call it send to a friend, many people will email the article, or 
often a product, to themselves so they can remember to look at it later. This is very 
common when you are building a product, such as customizing a new laptop computer, 
before you decide to buy it.
Print This Page  One thing that has amazed me over the years is how often people print 
pages and either call a business at a later date, read the story on the train, or pass the 
pages on to someone else they think would enjoy the information. As much as we live 
in a digital world, paper is still greatly used. Creating printer-friendly pages is useful 
because you can customize your site’s logo and URL on those pages so the searcher 
can always remember how to get in touch with your business or where the information 
originated.
None of these examples are exclusive. On a site like www.nytimes.com, for exam-
ple, you will see “print,” “email,” “search,” and “save” functionalities. On a site like 
Amazon.com, you will see “recommended,” “top rated,” and “top reviewed” prod-
ucts. Incorporating social and related information can help increase page views across 
your site.
Increasing the number of page views per visitor on your website is not just about 
selling more CPM ads. It also ensures that your visitors are finding the information 
they seek so they have a positive experience with your site and return, recommend it to 
another person, or buy from your company.

Chapter 6:  Le a r n i ng A dva nced Op t i m i zat ion T ech n iqu e s  ■
198
The information could be a product or an article. Incorporating some of these 
ideas on your website should not just increase page views—it should also increase con-
version rates as consumers find exactly what they are seeking and maybe a bit more (in 
the case of related products).
Techniques are available that are specifically geared toward increasing the con-
version rate. These techniques do not rely on making sure the consumer can wander 
around your site to find the specific information. Instead, they try to sell one product 
per keyword and do everything possible to have the consumer take one specific action.
Too Many Options Lead to Confusion
The more information you give to someone at a single time, the more mental processing it takes to 
absorb all the information. In psychology circles, this is known as cognitive load. Giving your visitor 
too many options can lead to cognitive overload, in which your visitor no longer has enough mental 
processing left to make a decision.
This phenomenon is often coupled with short-term memory capacity. Most people can hold only five 
to nine concepts in short-term memory. If you give someone too many options, they could forget the 
original reason for coming to your website or decide to wait until later to make a decision. Your site 
requires too much mental processing and memory capacity for the user.
Most users already have part of their short-term memory occupied with other tasks, such as why they 
visited your website or the fact that they have a meeting in 15 minutes. They have only a percent-
age of their cognitive load and short-term memory to dedicate to your website. Therefore, provide 
the user with options that are most beneficial for your company. If you are an e-commerce site, your 
primary option would be a sale. Your secondary option might be to create an account or subscribe to 
a newsletter. Your tertiary option might be social network sharing. You can test adding additional 
options, but your test should examine not just whether users are taking advantage of secondary or 
tertiary options but whether the percentage of users engaging in your primary options is decreasing.
Optimizing for Conversions
Instead of focusing on traffic, you could put your efforts into increasing conversion 
rates. These two optimization techniques are generally at odds with each other. With 
traffic, you are looking to entice someone to come to your website regardless of their 
intent. When trying to increase conversion rates, you are only trying to bring to your 
website people who may perform some action.
A 100 percent conversion rate is not useful with one visitor a month. Conversely, 
a million visitors a day with zero conversions is a quick way to go out of business. 
Therefore, you generally want to use a combination of both conversion and traffic opti-
mization when fully optimizing your AdWords campaign.

There are two aspects of increasing conversions: the ad copy and the landing 
page. We will start with techniques for writing high-converting ad copy and then move 
to additional landing page options you can implement to increase conversion rates.
Writing Ad Copy That Sells
Ad copy is the bridge between the search query and your website. If the bridge is invit-
ing to all, then all the cars will cross if the bridge leads in the generally correct direc-
tion. Conversely, if you hang a warning sign that says the bridge can support only up to 
certain weight and height limits, those who do not fit will not cross the bridge.
The sign serves as a filter to keep those who do not fit into your criteria away 
from your website, saving you money on those potential clicks. When trying to increase 
conversion rates, your ad copy should be inviting only to those whom you determine 
wish to perform an action on your website.
Usually, the ad copy’s job is to stand up and shout, “You can find the answer to 
your question here.” For increased conversion rates, the ad copy should instead be say-
ing, “We have the answer to your question if you want to perform this one action. If 
you do not want to perform that action, do not cross the bridge.” That action could be 
one of the following:
••
Call us to schedule a visit.
••
Buy an HD TV.
••
Subscribe to our newsletter.
••
Fill out a form to receive free quotes.
The second line of your ad copy should be a specific action you want the user to 
complete on your website (Figure 6.7).
Figure 6.7  Use calls to action in your ad copy.
By letting visitors know exactly what you want them to do, you are accomplish-
ing two goals:
••
Those who do not wish to complete that action are less likely to click on the ad.
••
Those who do click are more predisposed to both perform the action and to seek 
ways to conduct that action on your website.

As discussed in Chapter 4, “Writing Compelling Ads,” a call to action can still 
contain a benefit. Testing benefit-laden call-to-action ads is one of the most important 
tests you should run to keep unqualified searchers from clicking.
Your CTR will decrease when you use ad copy that discourages unqualified 
searchers from clicking your ads. Since CTR is one of the most important Quality 
Score factors, you could see a drop in Quality Score. This is why it is crucial to test 
your ads. You have to balance your AdWords account between Quality Score, traffic, 
and conversions. This is a difficult balance to find, and only through trial and error 
will you find the correct combination for you.
When your ad does receive a click, it should be from a prequalified searcher 
who is ready to continue down the conversion path. The next step is making sure that 
your landing page can keep the searcher on the path toward reaching your goal of 
conversion.
Creating Landing Pages That Increase Conversions
When designing landing pages to increase conversions, before you move to the next 
step you must decide whether to use
••
A dedicated landing page designed only for conversions and single actions
••
A page of your existing website
If you use a page in your existing website, you most likely have additional navi-
gational and other elements on the page. You can still use some techniques to increase 
conversions, but some users will wander off your primary conversion path. Most 
e-commerce sites send traffic to pages in their existing website. You may choose a few 
of your top-selling products or late sales cycle keywords to send to dedicated landing 
pages with a different layout than your usual site. However, it is rarely cost effective to 
design a dedicated landing page for every product.
If you use a dedicated landing page for the search query, you can control every 
option a user has, which can help increase conversion rates. However, be careful of 
limiting someone’s options too much if the keyword falls into the early buying cycle 
phases. Someone who is researching a product is not yet ready to purchase and will 
want some additional options to learn more about the product or service.
Using Dedicated Landing Pages
Dedicated landing pages are excellent for form actions, such as receiving quotes, filling 
out a contact form, or subscribing to a newsletter. With dedicated landing pages, you 
need to choose only one or two actions you want someone to complete. If you don’t 
overwhelm users with choices, you have made the conversion choice for them. Now 
your page needs to move them from viewing the page to taking action.

■  Op t i m i zi ng for Con v ersions

When limiting a user’s options, it is also important to keep in mind Google’s 
landing page criteria:
••
Relevance
••
Navigation
••
Transparency about the business and personal information collection
“One-page wonders”—single-page websites that often contained 100 paragraphs 
of scrolling sales copy with only one option on the page, usually an email signup—were 
saddled with very low Quality Scores a few years ago. This was due to the fact that 
the user had no options, rarely was there a privacy policy, and there was little business 
transparency.
You can be creative with dedicated landing pages as long as you keep the major 
AdWords landing page criteria in mind.
Keep Your Dedicated Landing Pages from Hurting Your SEO Efforts
If you spend time on search engine optimization (SEO), you want to make sure that your dedicated 
landing pages are not hurting your SEO efforts. If Google finds the same content on multiple pages, 
they will choose which one to rank; this is called the duplicate content penalty. Usually dedicated land-
ing pages are not built for ranking; they are built only for conversions. Therefore, you do not want 
them included in the regular Google index.
The easiest way to keep these pages from being spidered by Google is to put them in their own folder 
(such as yoursite.com/landingpages). Then in your robots.txt file, exclude Googlebot from 
indexing that folder. You can also exclude all bots from indexing the folder. If Adsbot-Google, the bot 
that spiders your page for AdWords, sees a global disallow in your robots.txt folder, it will ignore 
the instructions, since Google assumes that if you are buying traffic to a page you want that page spi-
dered for Quality Score purposes. If you accidentally block Adsbot-Google, then Google cannot spider 
your page and you will see poor Quality Scores.
You can also make microsites that are used only for PPC and conver-
sion purposes. We have several dedicated pages at our AdWords training site at 
CertifiedKnowledge.org and a few microsites. One microsite that has been particularly 
effective at conversions for general keywords (Figure 6.8) includes the major benefits 
of our program and quick calls to action to learn more or start a trial. There is some 
navigation on the microsite; however, this microsite is only about 10 pages, whereas 
our entire site is a few thousand. If you need to explain more about your product, show 
demos, and so forth, you might need more than a single page. In that case, feel free to 
design a small site whose only purpose is conversions.

Chapter 6:  Le a r n i ng A dva nced Op t i m i zat ion T ech n iqu e s  ■
202
Figure 6.8  Certified Knowledge microsite designed for conversions
When designing dedicated landing pages or microsites, make sure that your 
primary action is above the fold (in this case, action 1 is taking a video tour) and the 
page centers on that one particular action. The action could be a form fill, add-to-cart 
button, or any other action you desire. The most important aspect is to make sure that 
there is a very clear call to action that is the first thing your visitors notice.
You may need to adjust your single call to action based on how someone uses 
your site before they take an action. In the case of Certified Knowledge, almost every-
one either watches a video tour or visits at least four pages before signing up for a free 
trial. Therefore, the first call to action is the video play, the second is easy navigation, 
and the third is the free trial. In the case where we are just letting a user sign up for a 
free newsletter, the newsletter form is above the fold in a called-out box because a user 
does not need to watch a video or visit four pages before they subscribe. The secret to 
redesigning a page or microsite is to see how searchers are using your site before taking 
a conversion action and then designing your site around the user’s conversion path or 
making the path even easier with a new layout and path.

Increasing E-commerce Conversion Rates
Add-to-cart buttons are essential for e-commerce websites and should appear anyplace 
the product appears. This means users should be able to add a product to the shopping 
cart from the product page, category page, specials page, and even search results pages.
Detailed product information should be available within one click of the land-
ing page. Even if you have a dedicated landing page for a product, detailed information 
should be easily accessible. Although people ready to purchase may ignore it, you will 
engage those who are still learning about a product before they are ready to buy.
Bose has an excellent example of an e-commerce landing page (Figure 6.9). The 
major actions on the page are Buy Now and Learn More. The information above the 
fold for most monitors ends at the Learn More link. In addition, you can mouse over 
aspects of the headset to see its benefits.
Keeping with Google’s policies, there is also navigation at the bottom of the 
page for those who wish to view other Bose products or headsets.
Figure 6.9  Bose headset landing page

Chapter 6:  Le a r n i ng A dva nced Op t i m i zat ion T ech n iqu e s  ■
204
Whereas Bose went with limited navigation, Amazon did something quite differ-
ent. Once you enter their shopping cart, all your options change. You still have naviga-
tional options, but those options, like change shipping address, add a credit card, and 
so forth, are all intended to keep you moving toward finishing your purchase.
Shipping prices should be easily accessible. Consumers are very conscious about 
shipping prices. If you offer free shipping, make sure your landing page reinforces that 
message. If you ship to multiple countries, also make that obvious.
Make sure the shopping cart is easy to find. On some sites, you cannot view the 
cart unless you have just added a new product, which means that if someone adds a 
product, then starts shopping around, they cannot check out until they add another 
product. On other sites, the shopping cart is simply difficult to find. Use a highly visible 
shopping cart icon that can be easily found by visitors.
Do not put a registration barrier between the shopping cart and the final check-
out. Registration requirements only serve to increase the number of abandoned carts 
on your site. If you would like users to register, give them the option to do so, and a 
reason why it will benefit them, after you have processed their credit card.
The shopping process should be no more than three pages. The longer the check-
out process takes, the higher the chance of shopping cart abandonment.
The Easiest Way to Increase Profits
Rarely are there simple ways of increasing profits dramatically; however, not forcing account cre-
ation is one of them. I was working with an advertiser who had a mandatory account-creation pro-
cess before you could buy. I asked them to simply uncheck the account-creation button in their site 
for a few days to see what would happen. They agreed, and the next day their revenue went up 40 
percent. There are not too many things that can increase revenue by 40 percent in a single day; how-
ever, not forcing account creation is one of the few items that can have dramatic changes in overall 
revenue. This dramatic change might not happen for everyone, but even a 10–20 percent change in 
revenue is worth unchecking a simple box and moving account creation to after you have processed 
the credit card.
Please note, these are all considered best practices because they work far more 
often than not. There are times to break with best practices based on your own data. 
We had one site that had the potential for a lot of repeat buying opportunities. We did 
a test and forced people to register before they could check out on the site. By requir-
ing users to register, it became easy for them to save preferences, which enabled us 
to more effectively market to them later through email and other tactics, which can 
increase lifetime customer values. What happened is that the conversion rates dropped 

■  Op t i m i zi ng for Con v ersions
205
a little more than 25 percent with the forced registration. However, the lifetime value 
of each customer increased by more than 70 percent. In this case, while the forced reg-
istration lowered conversions, the overall profits increased due to the higher lifetime 
values. Start with best practices, and then if you have a good hypothesis for testing 
against them, try it out to see when you should break away from commonly accepted 
wisdom.
Increasing Form-Fill Conversion Rates
Web-based forms are used to collect email addresses and other contact information, 
check out on an e-commerce site, or register for a download. They are heavily used 
but may be the least optimized pages across the entire Web. How intimidating do your 
forms look?
Even if you only want to collect name, email address, physical address, phone 
number, and credit card information, it still is common to see a form with at least  
these fields:
••
First name
••
Last name
••
Email address
••
Confirm email address
••
Address line 1
••
Street type
••
Address line 2
••
City
••
State
••
Zip code
••
Area code
••
3-digit phone exchange
••
Last 4 phone digits
••
Credit card type
••
Credit card number
••
Credit card expiration date
••
Card verification value
For our purposes, we are going to keep the form simpler to illustrate a point and 
assume that your billing address is same as the shipping address. If these fields are just 
tossed on a webpage, it looks like it will take a while to fill out (Figure 6.10).

Chapter 6:  Le a r n i ng A dva nced Op t i m i zat ion T ech n iqu e s  ■
206
Figure 6.10  Poor form collection layout
While this form is not that long in comparison to many forms on the Web, 
compare the form in Figure 6.10 to another form that collects the exact same data 
(Figure 6.11).
Figure 6.11  A simple form that collects a lot of data
In the second form, Figure 6.11, the title field (Mr., Mrs., etc.) is used to deter-
mine the gender. The zip code field will let the merchant know the user’s city and state. 
The credit card number denotes the card type. Consumers type first name and then last 
name. There is little need to make someone fill out separate fields. Your development 
team can parse out this information.
These simple form design principles work very well in most areas outside of 
e-commerce. If you have shipped to rural areas, or have dealt with individuals who have 
hyphenated last names, then you have come across exceptions where you might need the 
first name field or where someone’s zip code does not match their city shipping address.

■  Op t i m i zi ng for Con v ersions
207
Credit Card vs. Non–Credit Card Forms
Occasionally, the approach of asking for first name and then last name in separate fields works bet-
ter for credit card collection because consumers are trained to input credit card data in specific ways. 
However, for non–credit card forms, the fewer fields, the better. You can have your developers parse 
the information into your CRM or follow-up system as necessary to match the fields between the two 
systems.
In cases where you need to ensure the information is exactly correct, you have 
three options:
••
Ask more explicit questions, but try to keep to as few fields as possible.
••
Collect basic information with simple fields on the first form page. Save that 
information (especially basic contact information), and then present users with 
specific fields on page 2 of the form.
••
Show a final review page before submitting the order, which is common with 
shopping carts, where you present your full information to users and then let 
them edit any mistakes.
In most cases, users will not need to edit their information. However, there will 
be some exceptions, and using a final review page will allow those few users to edit 
their information, while the majority of users who have standard addresses and names 
will quickly go through the entire form process.
Note:  Did you know that all American Express cards start with a 3? All Visa credit cards start with a 4, 
MasterCards start with a 5, and Discover start with a 6. Asking for both the credit card type and the credit card 
number is redundant.
The following are a few crucial considerations when designing forms:
The Value of Your Information  When users are filling out a form, they are getting something 
of value in return. If you ask for more valuable information than they are receiving, 
your form abandonment rate will increase.
Sales vs. Marketing  Many companies have a fight between marketing and sales. Marketing 
tells sales that if they ask only for a name, phone number, and email address, then sales 
can contact the prospective customer. Sales wants to know the contact’s cell phone, 
best time to call, industry, how much money they make, the total income of the com-
pany, and the person’s title. This is enough to make many customers abandon a form.
A compromise can take place between marketing and sales. On the first page of a form, 
ask for basic information that sales needs to contact the customer. On page 2, inform 

Chapter 6:  Le a r n i ng A dva nced Op t i m i zat ion T ech n iqu e s  ■
208
the customer that you would like to personalize their phone call, but to do so you need 
to collect some additional information. This second page is where you can ask some of 
the more intrusive questions such as cell phone and gross sales numbers. Sales will not 
receive everyone’s full information, but they can still put their calls in a queue based on 
the information they do receive.
Making Buying Easy  Have you ever filled out a credit card form where your information 
was rejected because you did not use spaces? Or received the error that the form will 
not accept spaces or dashes in the credit card field? If someone is trying to give you a 
credit card number, take it. Your developers can parse out spaces and dashes on the 
back-end and accept the customer’s data regardless of their personal preference for typ-
ing out their card information.
Respecting the Customer’s Time  Setting proper expectations is important for any business, 
especially when it comes to respecting someone’s time. If you have a very long form, 
just tell the customer how long it will take to complete. If someone fills out page 1 and 
then sees page 2, then page 3, that prospective customer will start worrying about their 
time investment and may abandon the form. Tell the customer, “This is a three-page 
form and will take five minutes of your time. If you need assistance, do not hesitate to 
call us and we will walk you through the form.” That small message sets the expecta-
tion of how long it will take, respects the customer’s time, and gives them additional 
conversion options.
Many customers feel reassured of their progress by seeing a graphical navigation bar 
at the top of the page showing their progress. Let’s say your checkout process is as 
follows:
	
1.	
Review cart.
	
2.	
Choose shipping method and address.
	
3.	
Enter credit card billing.
	
4.	
Review everything one last time.
	
5.	
Check out.
Showing those steps at the top of the page—and which page the customer is currently 
on—can help people understand the process, see if they have a chance to review their 
information, and know when they will be finished.
An Informed Searcher Is a Happy Searcher  Make sure the searcher has the necessary informa-
tion to complete a form before they start filling in the form’s fields. Many landing 
pages are simply forms with limited information. Many of these forms contain detailed 
questions that require some knowledge about the industry. If your form contains a field 
for which a searcher does not know the answer, they will have to abandon your form 
to do some research. Whenever you ask a specific question that the consumer might not 
know the answer to, make sure that information can be easily found on your website.

■  Op t i m i zi ng for Con v ersions
209
For example, say someone searched for merchant accounts and came to a form page on 
your site. They happily fill out the first page of the application. Then, the second page 
of the application asks a required question, “What type of merchant account do you 
want?” If the searcher does not know that different types of merchant accounts exist, 
they have to abandon your form to do this additional research.
Note:  One of the best ways to optimize forms is to track where the forms are being abandoned and then 
investigate for potential causes. If you find there are two or three fields where abandonment consistently happens, 
add information to the page or change those particular fields.
Some Questions Should Never Be Asked  It is common to see the question, “How did you hear 
about us?” on a form. The data received is usually very poor. I worked with a company 
that spent millions each year in marketing on many channels except TV. Every time the 
company surveyed customers as to how they heard about the company, TV was always 
number one. They could move the TV option anywhere in the list, but consumers still 
picked TV. Your analytics system will tell people how they found you.
Form Label to Field Input  It takes a user 10 times longer for their eyes to go from a field 
label to a form input when the field names are left justified versus when the field label is 
just above the form. If it is a short form, then putting the field label directly above the 
form input is a good idea; however, that does make the total form longer. If it’s a long 
form, then right justifying the field label to the form input is a good idea. There are no 
good use cases for left justifying your field labels.
A poorly designed form can drastically lower conversion rates. A well-optimized 
form can significantly raise conversion rates. Take a look at your forms, see how intim-
idating they seem, and find ways of making them friendly and easy to complete.
 What If the Consumer Is Not Yet Ready to Buy?
Not everyone is ready to conduct an action when they visit your website. It is impor-
tant to consider what is happening in the searcher’s life that would cause that person 
not to convert so that you can engage these potential customers.
••
Many office workers hide in their cubicles and shop online. However, while they 
may surf at work, they might not be ready to pull out the credit card while still 
in the office.
••
Administrative assistants are often asked to conduct research on a topic and 
compile a list of resources and papers. This information is then handed to a sec-
ond person to evaluate and make a decision.
••
A shopper spends the afternoon on a site configuring options for the next com-
puter they wish to purchase. Before they buy, they need to wait for the next pay-
day and get their spouse’s opinion.

Chapter 6:  Le a r n i ng A dva nced Op t i m i zat ion T ech n iqu e s  ■
210
In all three of these scenarios, someone may give your company money, but 
it will not be today. What options do you give those who are not ready to purchase 
immediately?
Empowering the customer to be able to print pages, download whitepapers, 
save items in a cart, send a configuration in email, and so forth can help entice users to 
come back to your site when they are ready to purchase. This is especially important 
in industries with long sales cycles. It is common for business-to-business companies to 
have six months pass between initial contact and final purchase.
One of the reasons to ask for an email address in up-front fields is to send 
reminders when forms are abandoned on your website. If a consumer adds products 
to their shopping cart, makes it through two steps of the cart, and suddenly abandons 
your site, you can increase conversions by sending them a reminder email that their 
shopping cart is about to expire. You can do the same for whitepapers or any form that 
captures an email address. There are times when the phone rings or someone walks 
into the office and disrupts the conversion process. Please note that when sending 
emails such as this, you must follow any applicable laws, such as the CAN-SPAM Act.
In many of these cases, you might need to add additional conversion types so 
you can track the initial conversion and keep in touch with your prospective customer 
as you move them through the analysis of your products to finally purchase.
Allowing Consumers to Contact You Their Way
Do you force searchers to email you? Do you only list a phone number? Do you offer 
live chat? Different types of consumers have their favorite ways of contacting a busi-
ness. If that choice is not available, they may not contact you at all.
You might want to offer more contact options than necessary for a while, see 
which ones are being used, and then remove the rest. If your customers do not use live 
chat, there is no reason to support it.
If you offer only phone support, and you answer the phone only during business 
hours during the week, what do you expect customers to do when they click on your 
ads during the weekend or at night? You should offer them a different course of action, 
and maybe even a different landing page, to make sure you are not alienating those 
searchers.
Many businesses find that by offering both email and phone support, their con-
version rate increases due to additional consumer choice.
Making Additional Conversions to Increase Your Profits
In Chapter 2, “Performing Keyword Research,” we discussed the consumer decision-
making process, known as the buying funnel. Many companies can benefit by add-
ing conversion actions to different segments of this process to keep in touch with the 

■  Op t i m i zi ng for Con v ersions
211
consumer and to keep moving the consumer through the buying funnel toward a final 
purchase.
If you have a long sales cycle, what does your conversion funnel look like?
Too many conversion funnels look like this:
	 1.	
Offer a free whitepaper download.
	 2.	
Hope the customer calls you (or add the customer to your email list).
	 3.	
If the customer calls you, try to sell them something.
This type of conversion funnel relies on the customer reading your whitepaper, 
doing their research, understanding your business, and then deciding to contact you.
Consider a conversion funnel such as this:
	 1.	
Searcher downloads a whitepaper to learn more about the product.
	 2.	
Searcher is sent an email to attend a free webinar to learn more about your com-
pany and how the product will benefit them.
	 3.	
Searcher attends free webinar and becomes more confident about your company.
	 4.	
Salesperson calls customer to offer free demo.
	 5.	
Salesperson conducts personalized demonstration with customer.
	 6.	
Customer makes a decision.
The second conversion funnel allows for more customer contact, more hand-
holding, more interaction, a better customer relationship, and usually more sales.
Even if the customer’s decision is to not buy from you, often the effort you put 
into the second conversion funnel is the same or less than the first one, because you do 
not have salespeople constantly calling or emailing to reach a bad prospect—the pros-
pect has made up their mind. In addition, in this second conversion funnel, the pros-
pect knows more about your company and may feel confident in recommending you to 
someone else as an option, or they might call you back when their situation changes.
When sales teams call customers after they have only attended a webinar or 
read a whitepaper, customers are usually resistant because they do not have enough 
information to make a decision. When there are multiple touch points, the customers 
naturally move through the conversion cycle into having enough information to make a 
decision.
By adding additional conversion options and tracking them all, you can see what 
patterns lead to higher conversion rates. In the previous scenario, you might find that 
the free demo does not increase conversion rates, so you could remove it. Or you could 
find that when someone attends your webinar, your contact ratio increases signifi-
cantly, so you push that conversion option to more consumers.

Understanding Your Conversion Options
A conversion is anything you define it to be on your website. Some conversions are 
discreet actions that generate revenues and profits, such as contacts, purchases, or sub-
scriptions. However, conversions don’t necessarily need to be revenue events for them 
to be useful to measure and track. Conversions that are “softer” actions, such as a visi-
tor entering your conversion funnel or viewing a key page or pages, can also be impor-
tant to track.
Here are some common conversion types that are worthy of tracking:
Contact Us  Use this conversion action to track how often visitors contact your business.
Any Form Fill  Every time a form is filled out on your site, you gain some information or a 
searcher has taken an action.
vCard Download  A vCard or “save to contacts” option allows you to be part of someone’s 
Outlook or other email program.
Whitepaper Download  Whitepapers are often PDF files that cover details about a product 
or idea. Offering whitepapers is critical in business-to-business selling where the person 
doing the research is not the decision maker.
Webinar  A webinar is an online presentation.
Subscription  When someone subscribes to your newsletter, RSS feed, or protected section 
of your website, you have a chance to continue the conversation.
Save to Cart and Add to Wish List  These are various ways to let someone save a product to buy 
at a later date. Allowing people to publish their wish lists can also help your website’s 
visibility and conversion rate.
E-commerce Checkout  Someone gave you money—track it!
Send to Friend (or Self) via Email  Allow someone to send product or article information to 
another person, or even to themselves to investigate at a later date.
Send to SMS or Mobile Phone  This is useful to allow customers to send your contact infor-
mation or driving directions to their phone.
Driving Directions  If you have a physical store, track how often people are getting direc-
tions to visit you in-store.
Phone Call  Phone call tracking takes some work, but it allows you to understand how 
many calls and sales your marketing is generating. With more sophisticated systems, 
you can even correlate phone calls to keywords, ad groups, landing pages, and ad copy.
Bookmark  While this does not lead to direct revenue, it shows some interaction with 
your site.

■  Be st Pr ac t ice s for A dva nced Op t i m i zat ion T ech n iqu e s
213
Social Network Share  There is no direct revenue in a social network share; however, if 
someone shares information from your site with their social network, it can lead to 
increased free traffic and more sales down the road. Understanding what content visi-
tors are sharing, how they are sharing it (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.) is becom-
ing increasingly useful to many businesses.
Print Page  Offering a printer-friendly page and Print button can allow you to see how 
often your information is being printed. It is not uncommon for searchers to print a 
web page) and call a business at a later date.
Coupon Print  If you have a physical store, track both how often coupons are printed and 
how often they are redeemed in the store. With proper coding, coupon redemption can 
be traced back to a keyword, landing page, and ad copy.
While offering too many conversion options can cause consumers to be over-
whelmed and unsure which is correct for them, offering too few can cause you to lose 
consumers either on the initial visit or by not being able to move them through the

Best Practices for Advanced Optimization Techniques
The first step to any pay-per-click campaign is to send traffic to your website by bid-
ding on relevant keywords. There will be many times when you want to increase the 
traffic your website receives. In those cases, these practices can help bring more visitors 
from the search engine to your site:
••
The impression share report will help you identify why your ad is not being 
shown, and then you can take action to improve the situation:
••
If you are already hitting your daily budget, then either raising your budget 
or lowering your maximum CPCs can increase the number of clicks you 
receive without adding new keywords.
••
If you are not reaching your daily budget and you have a high impression 
share, the next step is to either increase your ad’s CTR or add more general 
keywords.
••
One technique for raising CTRs is to use dynamic keyword insertion to auto-
matically insert keywords into your ad copy:
••
The trick to proper use of dynamic keyword insertion is to correctly use 
your ad copy capitalization syntax, because this will determine how your 
keywords are displayed in the ads.
••
When using dynamic keyword insertion, make sure your ad stands out from 
the other ads on the page.

It does not matter whether you send traffic to a dedicated landing page or 
an existing page of your website. Here are some best practices you should follow to 
increase conversion rates:
••
The visitor should feel that the landing page is what the ad was describing—that 
is, it should be an extension of the ad copy:
••
The call to action that appears in the ad copy should be on the landing page.
••
Any claims, pricing, or special discounts should be echoed on the landing 
page.
••
Create a synergy between the ads and the landing page so that visitors feel they 
have arrived at the correct site:
••
When using image and rich media ads, echo the same images in the ads on 
the landing page to avoid confusing the visitors by a landing page that has a 
very different look and feel. The graphics can be different sizes and shapes 
but the same basic images.
••
Make sure that any offer made in your ads appears on your landing page, so 
that the visitor knows they’ve arrived at the correct website.
••
Leverage the few simple principles of increasing conversion rates:
••
Have a clear call to action.
••
Have a clear path to action.
••
Offer a compelling benefit and message.
••
Ensure your information is accessible to all.
••
Ensure the user has the correct information to make a decision.
••
Make the conversion process painless.
The principles are easy to grasp. The execution of those principles is difficult but 
well worth the effort to master.
Furthermore, testing ad copy and landing page layouts is essential to maximiz-
ing both traffic and conversions. Once you test, you need to let both the results of those 
tests and your analytics systems tell you the story of what combination provides the 
best response rates to turn searchers into customers.

Demystifying 
Quality Score
Quality Score is one of the most important 
numbers in your Google AdWords account, 
because it has far-reaching effects on your 
AdWords success. This number can decide the 
fate of your account. Low Quality Scores can 
doom your account to failure. High Quality 
Scores can place your ad above your competi-
tors’ while you pay less per click than they do. 
It is also the hardest number to quantify and try 
to improve across your entire account.
This chapter examines what Quality Score 
affects within your account and the factors that 
influence your Quality Scores. You will also 
learn how to improve your Quality Scores to 
gain a strategic advantage over your competitors.

What Is Quality Score?
Quality Score is the single most confusing number in your entire AdWords account. It 
is often considered an ambiguous number that is almost impossible to directly change, 
and yet it has more impact on your account’s performance than any other number, and 
that includes your bid. So what is this Quality Score, anyway?
Quality Score is a metric that Google uses to help keep the paid search results 
relevant to searchers. Quality Score is also used to determine the ranked order of ads 
that appear for any given search result and is meant to balance the desire of advertisers 
to always have their ads above everyone else’s ads as long as they are willing to pay for 
it with the needs of searchers who are looking for relevant search results for both paid 
ads and organic search results.
Ads that are highly relevant to searchers’ intent are assigned higher Quality 
Scores. Google has many factors it considers for relevancy, which I will discuss in this 
chapter. By far, the most heavily weighted factor is click-through rate (CTR). The more 
people tend to click on your ad, the more relevant the ad must be.
Without a Quality Score factor, the highest bidder would always show first for 
any search result, and you can imagine the types of ads you would see over and over 
again that have nothing to do with your search query. If Google were to allow totally 
irrelevant ads to appear for search queries, users would soon stop clicking on paid ads 
and even abandon Google in favor of other search engines. That’s not good for Google 
or advertisers and certainly not for people conducting searches.
By using a relevancy metric in its calculation, Google helps balance the com-
mon needs of Google, its advertisers, and people who rely on it to deliver great search 
results.
The reason this number is especially important to advertisers is that Quality 
Score influences so many aspects of your AdWords campaigns, such as the following:
Your Actual CPC  Your actual CPC is the cost you pay for any one click. You pay a penny 
more to beat the ad rank of the advertiser just below you. Since Quality Score is a large 
factor in ad rank, your Quality Score can significantly affect your actual CPC. This 
concept is fully explained in the section “How Quality Score Affects Ad Rank.”
Your First Page Bid  The first page bid is an estimate given to you by Google for each of 
your keywords that is an approximation of what you need to bid for your ad to show 
up on page 1 of the search results.
Your Top of Page Bid  Your top of page bid is an estimate of what you need to bid for your 
ad to show in the premium positions at the top of a search result.
Your Minimum Bid  For each keyword auction, Google sets a minimum bid required to even 
qualify for the auction based up your Quality Score. This is why you might choose a 
keyword with no competitors and your first page bid will be higher than $0.01. If your 
bid is lower than the minimum bid for that keyword in that auction, then your ad will 

■  W h at Is Qua li t y Scor e?
217
not show until your bid is at least equal to the minimum bid. Unfortunately, you won’t 
find this minimum bid amount reported anywhere in your account. The closest you’ll 
come is the first page bid, as explained previously. Raising your Quality Scores can 
lower these minimum bids.
Ad Rank for the Search Network  Ad rank is a numerical score that Google calculates for each 
ad that qualifies to show in each keyword auction. The ad rank is an unpublished, 
internally calculated score used only by Google to determine the order of ads on a 
search results page. The ad with the highest ad rank score displays highest on the page, 
the next highest is second, and so on.
Eligibility to Appear on Specific Display Sites  Display Network ads appear on nonsearch 
pages. In search, Google looks to see if the search query is related to your keywords. 
On the Display Network, Google looks to see if the article’s contents are related to 
your keywords. For example, if someone is reading an article about airline travel on 
the New York Times site, the display ads will also be related to airline travel. Your 
Quality Score, along with several other factors, is used to determine whether your ad 
can appear on one of these sites when the site content matches your display campaign 
keywords.
Whether a Placement Targeted Ad Will Appear  With Google’s managed placements option, you 
can select individual websites across the Display Network where you would like your 
ad to appear. Your Quality Score will help determine whether your ad can appear on 
the sites you select.
Some Essential Terminology
Here are definitions of the various types of networks covered in this and other chapters:
Search Partners  Sites where you conduct a search but that are not owned by Google, such as  
AOL.com and Ask.com.
Google Search Network  Sites that are owned by Google, such as Google.com and Google.co.uk.
Google Display Network  Sites owned by Google where ads are shown based on the content of 
the page, rather than based on someone conducting a search; examples include YouTube.com and 
Gmail.com.
Google Network  Both search and display sites that are owned by Google.
Display Network  Sites that may or may not be a part of the Google Display Network where an ad is 
displayed based on the article’s contents, such as NYTimes.com and Gmail.com. For instance, the New 
York Times shows AdWords ads on their article pages based on the article’s content, yet the New York 
Times is not owned by Google.
To make matters confusing, Google considers some of their own search sites, such as maps.google.com, 
as search partner sites and not as Google search sites.

218
Essentially, if you can increase your Quality Score, you can pay less for clicks 
and increase your ad’s visibility by having it shown higher in the search results. Every 
keyword in your account is assigned a Quality Score, which Google reports as a metric 
at the keyword level.
Quality Score is an important metric that you can manage and optimize as long 
as you understand what factors go into it and how it impacts various elements within 
your account, such as ads, keywords, and landing pages. By breaking down Quality 
Score and examining its associated factors, you can understand how to improve your 
Quality Scores and the performance of your whole account in the process.
How Quality Score Affects Ad Rank
Every time your ad is shown, the keyword is given an ad rank score. The higher your 
ad rank, the higher the position in which your ad will appear. At the same time, 
Google determines the ad rank for all the other ads that could be shown. The ad with 
the highest ad rank is shown in the first position; the second ad rank is shown in the 
second position, and so on.
Ad rank is calculated by examining your max CPC, your Quality Score, and 
how your ad extensions will affect your CTR. Google does not publish their current ad 
rank formula, so to illustrate how Quality Score affects your ad rank, we can examine 
the history of ad rank and make some assumptions about the current usage.
When Google first launched, ad rank was determined by a simple formula:
Ad Rank = Maximum Bid × CTR
This formula allowed Google to maximize their profits. If an advertiser had a 
very high bid but did not receive any clicks, then Google did not make any money from 
this advertiser. If another advertiser had a lower bid but did receive a large number 
of clicks, they would make Google more money than the advertiser bidding higher. 
Therefore, this model allowed for Google to make the most money possible from 
search results.
The problem with this formula is that it only took into account CTR and bids. 
Therefore, you could have a very poor landing page, or ads that were irrelevant to the 
keyword, and still have a high ad rank. This formula did not take the user experience 
into account. Therefore Google introduced Quality Score in an attempt to automate 
the user experience.
In 2005, Google introduced Quality Score in attempts to fix some system issues 
with minimum bids and improve both the advertiser and the user experience. When 
Quality Score was introduced, Google changed the ad rank formula to:
Ad Rank = Maximum Bid × Quality Score
This ad rank formula lasted for several years until 2013, when Google again 
changed the ad rank formula to include ad extension data. Using ad extensions can 

■  W h at Is Qua li t y Scor e?
219
have dramatic effects on your CTR, and since the main factor of Quality Score was 
CTR, it made sense to fold this additional data into the ad rank formula.
Ad Extension Impact on CTR
Ad extensions can make dramatic changes on your CTRs. When the data is averaged across all accounts, 
sitelinks increase CTRs by 30 percent and seller ratings by 17 percent, and the other extensions raise CTR 
by 6 percent–10 percent. You can see these numbers at http://­certifiedknowledge.org/blog/
the-complete-adwords-audit-part-4-ad-extensions/.
Bing sees similar increases with ad extension CTRs and shared some statistics compiled by BIA/
Kelsey at a private event on how they see ad extensions increase CTR. According to this data, sitelinks 
increase CTR 29 percent in the United States and location extensions increase CTR from 10 percent to 
33 percent depending on the market.
Since we don’t know the current ad rank formula, to illustrate how Quality 
Score affects ad rank, we have to make some assumptions and then create our own 
basic formula.
Please note that this is not the actual formula. The actual formula is much more 
complex; this information is for illustration purposes only.
Over the course of AdWords history, Google has allotted 50 percent of the ad 
rank formula to max CPC and 50 percent to CTR or Quality Score. Since Google has 
been consistent over many years of allocating half of ad rank to the max bid, we can 
assume that is still true in the new formula and that the addition of extensions is calcu-
lated into the Quality Score half of the equation. Therefore, we can make suppositions 
that the simplified formula could be
Ad Rank = max CPC × ((Quality Score × 0.8) + (Ad Extension × 0.2))
In this formula, we are allocating half of the ad rank to bids and half to Quality 
Score and ad extension information. Of the half we are allocating to Quality Score and 
ad extensions, 80 percent of the rank is coming from Quality Score and 20 percent of 
the rank is coming from ad extensions.
We do not know the actual allocation amount to these factors, and this is not 
the actual Google formula; this is as close an approximation as we can make. Google 
might allocate only 5 percent to extensions, or they could allocate 90 percent to exten-
sions. Because extensions do not take into account the quality of the ad and landing 
page but only an adjustment to CTR, it would make sense that its allocation amount 
does not exceed 25 percent; however, that is an educated guess based on Google’s his-
torical usage of Quality Score and ad rank.
The reason we need to examine this data is to show how important the Quality 
Score and the ad extensions are to ad rank.

For each auction, Google calculates ad rank for every advertiser. Your ad rank 
by itself is meaningless, and of course you have no idea what it actually is. Your ad 
rank matters only in terms of other advertisers. Once ad rank is calculated for every-
one, then Google shows the ads in descending order from highest ad rank to lowest 
ad rank.
Table 7.1 shows how to use the proposed formula to determine position.

There are several ways you can write this formula to see ad rank numbers. In 
this case it was written as
Ad rank = (max CPC × ((0.8 × QS) + (0.2 × extensions))
This formula could also be expressed as
Ad rank = (max CPC * 0.5) × (0.4 × QS) × (0.1 × extensions)
In the case of the second formula, the actual ad rank numbers will be half as 
much as the first equation; however, the ratio of ad rank to each advertiser remains 
static, so even while the ad rank number changes, it changes evenly for all advertisers, 
and thus the final ordering in the search results would be the same.
When we examine the data, the first bidder has the highest Quality Score pos-
sible, a 10. In addition, advertiser 1 is using ad extensions well. Advertisers 2, 3, and 4 
are bidding higher than advertiser 1—in some cases, even 10 times higher in the case 
of advertiser 4. However, these advertisers’ Quality Scores and ad extension Quality 
Score factors are not very high, so even though they are bidding higher, their ad ranks, 
and thus final positions, are lower than those for advertiser 1.
Now, advertiser 5 is bidding twice as much as advertiser 1 ($2 versus $1), and 
while advertiser 5’s Quality Scores aren’t as high as advertiser 1’s, they are very good 
at 7. When you factor in twice the max CPC with good Quality Scores, advertiser 5 
would take the top position in a search result.
While this is not the actual formula, the concept it illustrates is true: If you can 
maintain higher Quality Scores (and ad extensions) than your competition, then you 
can pay less than your competition while showing your ad above theirs.

Since AdWords is a blind auction system, it is impossible to know what your 
competitors are bidding. The AdWords system is built on setting bids based on your 
advertising profits. To profitably increase bids, you may need to increase your website’s 
conversion rates, change match types, or try different ad copy. If you increase conver-
sion rates, you are increasing the searcher’s satisfaction with your website. It’s this user 
experience and satisfaction with your ads and landing pages that Google is trying to 
automate in determining Quality Scores. So, let us take a look at the factors used for 
determining Quality Scores.
Quality Score Factors for Search
There are a few Quality Score factors that Google calculates inside your AdWords 
account. The most transparent of all these scores is the one used for search, because 
you can see this number in both your account and your AdWords reports.
Let’s examine all of the factors used to determine the Quality Score that is 
shown in your AdWords account, and then I’ll show you some of the exceptions. The 
Quality Score factors are as follows:
Click-Through Rate on Google  The single most important factor in determining your Quality 
Score is your click-through rate (CTR). The higher your CTR, the higher your Quality 
Score usually is for each keyword.
The CTR is normalized by position. This means that your ad is not penalized for 
showing in a lower position, and conversely you don’t automatically get a boost when 
your ad is in higher positions that are expected to always have higher CTR. Google 
does not directly compare the CTR of an ad in position 5 with the ad in position 1, 
because Google understands that position 5 generally receives a lower CTR than posi-
tion 1; therefore, before CTR is used in the Quality Score calculation, Google normal-
izes the CTR across positions based on projected click-through rates at those positions 
to determine how effective your ad is at gathering clicks.
When ads are shown on the Google search network, only the CTR of the Google 
search network is used. Your Display Network CTR and search partner CTR do not 
matter whatsoever for determining your Quality Score for search when your ad is 
shown on a Google search network site.
When your ad is shown on a search partner, such as Ask.com or AOL.com, the CTR 
of your ad on that partner site is used along with your CTR on non-Google search 
partners.
Click-Through Rate of Display URLs within an Ad Group  Google tracks the display URLs used 
within your ad group separately from your text ads. The higher your display URL 
CTR, the higher your Quality Score can become. This is another reason to vary your 
display URLs and test to see which ones lead to higher CTRs.

Chapter 7:  Demyst i f y i ng Qua li t y Scor e  ■
222
Relevance of the Keywords to the Ad Copy within an Ad Group  Relevance is one of Google’s man-
tra words, and one of the places where this word takes on a special significance is 
in your ad copy. How closely does your ad copy describe and reflect your keyword? 
You do not have to use the actual keyword in the ad copy, but they should be closely 
related.
For example, the words flowers and roses are closely related. If the keyword is flowers 
and it triggers an ad copy about buying rose bouquets, these are closely related terms, 
since roses are a type of flower. A searcher may search for the word flowers but really 
want to buy roses.
However, the keywords real estate and mortgage are very different. When looking for 
real estate, the location, price, and number of bedrooms are pieces of the same puzzle. 
While most people who are looking to buy a house will need a mortgage, the search 
process is very different. A user looking for a mortgage is more interested in financial 
information than the number of bedrooms a house contains. In this instance, the ad 
copy will have a low relevance score because it is not helping someone arrive at the 
answers to their search query.
Term Frequency: Inverse Document Frequency
To think about how Google uses word relationships to determine Quality Score, the simplest calcula-
tion that you can consider is Term Frequency: Inverse Document Frequency, also known as TD-IDF. 
This is a set of mathematical calculations that examine how important a word is to the document (or 
search results) while weighting unique words (brain, plasma TV, and the like) over common words 
(the, a, in, of, and so on). TD-IDF among other calculations allows an algorithm to attempt to automate 
semantic relationships to determine how closely related search queries are to your ads, keywords, and 
landing pages.
Google does not do semantic analysis for determining relevance in Quality Score calcu-
lations. Instead, Google uses CTR analysis formulas to determine relevance. However, 
as an advertiser, you should think about relevance semantically so that you write com-
pelling ads for searchers based on what they are trying to find.
Relevance of the Keyword and Ad Copy to the Search Query  Google made a change in October 2008 
when they moved to real-time Quality Score calculations. In real time, Google evaluates 
the relevance of your keyword and the ad copy that will be shown in the search result 
and then compares your keyword and ad copy to the actual search query. Therefore, if 
you are using dynamic keyword insertion, it can help improve this one factor.
Since this factor is in real time, it does not influence the Quality Score shown in your 
account, but it does affect the Quality Score used when determining your ad position 
in that particular search result.

223
Development of Quality Score
When Google AdWords’ PPC program first launched in 2002, your ad rank was calculated as the bid 
times the click-through rate. To increase your position, you could either increase your CTR or increase 
your bid (all other factors being the same). However, if your CTR was low, your ad was simply not 
shown and was placed into a disabled state where it was difficult to ever have that keyword active in 
your account again.
In 2005, Google revamped the rules by introducing Quality Score and minimum bids. At first, Quality 
Score was simple and mostly determined by predicted CTR. Over the years, Google has tried to align 
Quality Score with searcher satisfaction. Usually the closer your ads and landing page are aligned with 
giving the consumer the answer to their question, the higher your Quality Score becomes.
Landing Page Quality  This factor is very similar to the relevance of ad copy to the key-
word. How relevant are your landing pages to the keyword? You do not have to have 
the actual keyword on the landing page; the landing page must be thematically related 
to the keyword.
I will go into greater detail on landing pages and landing page relevance factors in the 
section “Landing Page Quality: Making Your Pages Relevant,” later in this chapter
Landing Page Load Time  The speed at which your landing page loads for the user is a factor 
in determining Quality Score. If you meet the minimum load speed threshold, there is 
nothing more to optimize.
The AdWords system follows all keyword-level destination URLs (or ad-level if you do 
not use keyword-level URLs) to determine the final page to analyze.
When Google determines if your page loads fast enough to be considered acceptable 
to the user, it is just looking to see if the HTML of your page loads as fast as the other 
pages hosted in that same geography. Since Google looks only at the HTML—not 
image sizes, scripts, and the like—this should never be an issue for most accounts.
If you are having landing page load time issues and are not using redirects, you have a 
larger problem than your AdWords account. You need to evaluate your host and web-
site to find out why your site is loading so slowly.
If you are using redirects, make sure your redirects are not slowing down the searcher 
before they reach the final landing page. In the case of redirects, your site could load 
quickly, but if the redirects are slow, you may see issues with landing page load time.
Please note, this factor was displayed in the interface for a few years, and it has since 
been removed as its own displayed factor and is rolled into the general Landing Page 
experience factor. We will examine how you can see all of these factors for yourself in 
the next section, “Viewing Your Quality Score.”

Chapter 7:  Demyst i f y i ng Qua li t y Scor e  ■
224
Device  Google calculates these factors for each device type, such as mobile phones, tab-
lets, and computers. Users may have different search intents by device, and the landing 
page may work differently on various devices; therefore, your Quality Scores can vary 
by device.
Ad Performance by Geography  This is another factor that has more influence on your ad’s 
actual position than the Quality Score you see in your account. Your Quality Score 
actually can vary by geography, but the Quality Score you see reported is an aggregate 
of all places your ad shows. It is quite common that your ads will be shown in some 
geographies more than others because you have higher CTRs in those geographies.
This Quality Score factor could be at odds with your conversion rates. You may find 
that you have a higher conversion rate in one geography, but in a completely different 
area you have a higher CTR. In this instance, Google will show your ad more in the 
area with the higher CTR and you could lose out on conversions.
There is a geographic performance report that will give you insight into different sta-
tistics by geography, which I will cover in depth in Chapter 11, “Utilizing Advanced 
Geographic Targeting Techniques.”
Account History  Google examines the entire account, both the keywords and the ad copy, 
to determine how the account has done overall. Your overall account history is used 
when determining Quality Score.
With most AdWords statistics, such as account history and keyword CTR, the most 
recent history matters more than the overall history. Think of it as “What have you 
done for me lately?” Since most recent matters more than overall, accounts and key-
words can almost always be saved when the proper techniques are applied.
Quality Score Is Calculated Only by Precise Matches
When examining the Quality Score factors, do not worry about the click-through rate of related 
queries for your phrase and broad match keywords. If you add the same keyword as an exact match, 
phrase match, and broad match keyword, all three versions will have the same Quality Score. That 
Quality Score will be derived from the exact match version. If you have a broad match keyword that 
does not have the exact match equivalent in your ad group, Google will calculate the Quality Score for 
that keyword based on the times when the search query matched your keyword precisely.
Therefore, it is useful to either use an exact match version of all your keywords or run the search query 
report to see the actual CTR of your phrase and broad match words when attempting to optimize for 
Quality Score.

Other Relevancy Factors  Google uses many other relevancy factors that only occasionally 
apply. Most of these factors are fairly minor, are extremely difficult to optimize, and 
do not always come into play. Therefore, they are not disclosed by Google. However, 
they tend to be so minor they are not worth worrying about, and you can instead focus 
on the other factors described earlier.
For example, let’s assume two advertisers are using the broad match keyword teeth 
whitening. One of the advertisers is a dentist located in Chicago. The other advertiser 
is an e-commerce site that sells a teeth-whitening product. Now consider a searcher sit-
ting in Chicago doing a search for teeth whitening. Most dental queries are inherently 
local and the Chicago dentist is geo-targeting the Chicago area. In this instance, odds 
are that the Chicago dentist is a bit more relevant. Now let’s say the searcher changes 
their query to online teeth whitening. While the user is still sitting in Chicago, their 
search query has turned more product oriented than local oriented, and in this case the 
online e-commerce store might see a slight bump.
This scenario may not be used by Google, but it is intended to give insight into one of 
many reasons why Google might have these other relevancy factors that only some-
times come into play.
Most of these factors are used when determining the displayed Quality Score in 
your account (with the exception of the factors that vary by user, such as the relevance 
of the keyword and ad copy to the actual search query). However, the weighting of 
the various factors can change based on many other factors, such as the user being 
on a computer versus a mobile device, the user’s distance to a business (proximity), or 
the user’s previous interaction with ads on the page. Although it is useful to know the 
factors involved in determining Quality Score, it is equally useful to be able to see the 
actual Quality Score by keyword to understand how your keywords are doing.
Viewing Your Quality Score
Quality Score is listed as a number from 1 to 10. The higher the number, the better 
your Quality Score. Technically, Google keeps a different number strung out to many 
decimal places that is used in their calculations; however, they display only whole num-
bers to advertisers.
You can view your Quality Scores in the AdWords Editor or in the interface 
when you examine the Keywords tab (Figure 7.1).
The Quality Score column is hidden by default. If you do not see your Quality 
Score listed at the ad group or campaign level when viewing Keywords, then you will 
have to customize the columns.

Click the Columns link and then click Customize Columns. You will be pre-
sented with options for specifying statistics you would like to view (Figure 7.2).

Once the Quality Score column is shown for your account, you can click on the 
conversation box icon in the Status column to view more specific information about 
that keyword (Figure 7.3).
When you see a low Quality Score in your account, this is the first step you 
should undertake to diagnose problems. Often if there is a reason why your ads are not 
showing, it will also be shown in this dialog box.

The second place to view your Quality Score is in the AdWords Editor 
(Figure 7.4). The AdWords Editor is free software from Google that enables you to 
manage your account on your desktop (or when you are offline). I will discuss it in 
detail in Chapter 12, “Saving Time and Scaling Accounts with the AdWords Editor”; 
for now, please note that this is another place where you can view your Quality Score.
Figure 7.4  Viewing Quality Score in the AdWords Editor
The factors are simply broken down into above average, average, and below 
average. What you generally want to look for are items that are below average and see 
how you can raise them to average, or, even better, above average. We will examine 
how to increase Quality Scores a little later in this chapter.

One of the easiest ways to work with Quality Score is to export the data from 
your account into an AdWords report. This will give you a list of your keywords, 
Quality Scores, and other data that you can manipulate to find the areas of improve-
ment. I will revisit some ways to utilize this data in the section “Increasing Quality 
Scores,” later in this chapter.
Not only is your choice of landing pages important for increasing conversions; it 
is also essential to maintaining high Quality Scores. Later in this chapter, I will discuss 
ad group organization that will make it easy to choose the appropriate landing page. 
However, you also need to ensure that your landing page meets Google’s guidelines.
Landing Page Quality: Making Your Pages Relevant
Google has developed landing page guidelines for AdWords based on giving the searcher 
the best possible experience after they click on a Google ad and enter your website.
Luckily, most of these guidelines help with conversions and your website’s 
usability. By following these guidelines, you can make your page relevant for the con-
sumer and for Google’s Quality Score formula.
Spiderability
The first step to creating a relevant landing page is making sure that Google can read 
the page with their spiders (programs that index websites). If Google does not under-
stand your landing page, it cannot ascertain whether your landing page is relevant.
Google uses a few robots to spider your site for AdWords:
••
Adsbot-Google or Adsbot-Google-Mobile
••
Googlebot
A robots.txt file is an instruction manual that tells a robot what it can or can-
not crawl on your website. If you use disallow all robots from crawling a page, then 
Adsbot-Google will ignore your robots.txt instructions. Adsbot-Google ignores these 
global disallows because it assumes since you are buying traffic to that page, you want 
the page to be indexed so a Quality Score can be created.
There are times when Googlebot may index your site instead of Adsbot-Google. 
If Googlebot has recently visited your site, Adsbot-Google may ignore your website 
since AdWords will use the information from the Googlebot crawl to determine your 
Quality Scores. However, if you block Googlebot in your robots.txt file, then Adsbot-
Google will crawl your site so your account can be assigned Quality Scores.
If you are unsure how Adsbot-Google is treating your site, you can create a free 
Google Webmaster Tools account (google.com/webmasters/) and use their tools to ana-
lyze your robots.txt file and make sure the site can be crawled.
Once you know that your site can be crawled, the next step is creating rel-
evant pages.

■  L a n di ng Page Qua li t y: M a k i ng You r Page s R eleva n t
229
Relevance
The destination URL should lead the searcher to a page on your website that answers 
the searcher’s question or shows them how to receive their answer. This relevance is 
very similar to the ad copy relevance, because you do not need to have the actual key-
words on the landing page. The page needs to be topically related.
If you are unsure what Google thinks your page is about, use the AdWords 
Keyword Planner discussed in Chapter 3, “Keyword Tools: Extracting Valuable Data 
from Google.” Input your landing page and let Google crawl your site. Now examine 
the keywords. If the keywords are similar to the keywords in your ad group and what 
you think the page is about, your page should be relevant to the search query.
If the Keyword Planner thinks your page is about something completely differ-
ent, you need to revisit the content on your page and possibly rewrite some paragraphs. 
If you have a page that is mostly images and Flash, you may just wish to add some 
HTML content.
The content should also be unique to your site. You can have the content on 
multiple pages of your site, but you do not want the content to appear on other pages 
across the Web.
Note:  For paid search, it is acceptable to have the same content on multiple pages of your website. However, 
for organic search engine optimization, having the same content across your website can lead either to a duplicate 
content penalty or to Google ranking one page of your website when you would rather have a different page rank 
for that term. Use the robots.txt file to make sure only one version of your content is crawled and indexed by 
Googlebot. To learn about robots.txt files, visit www.robotstxt.org.
Sites that utilize manufacturer descriptions in their content can run into prob-
lems with this guideline. If there are a hundred sites with the same content, why should 
the searcher read it on your website? Mixing in some additional content, or writing 
some original content for your top-selling products, can help increase the originality of 
your website.
The same concept holds true for affiliates. Affiliates are companies that refer 
consumers to another company to buy a product and in return receive some sort of 
compensation. An easy example is travel agents who are affiliates for airlines and 
cruise ships. Often affiliates feel that Google dislikes them. This is not true. There are 
many affiliate sites that have fantastic user experiences within them. The questions 
affiliates should ask themselves are these:
••
Should the user have gone directly to the merchant instead of to my site first?
••
What did I include on my site to enhance the search experience?

Chapter 7:  Demyst i f y i ng Qua li t y Scor e  ■
230
Your landing page should contain unique and relevant content that can be read 
by Google’s bots. However, that is not quite enough to satisfy all of Google’s landing 
page requirements. Transparency to the user about your business and website is also 
considered.
Transparency
Consumers are increasingly becoming aware of scams, phishing attempts, and privacy 
issues online. Being transparent with your offers and business information goes a long 
way toward meeting Google’s editorial guidelines and landing page quality, and it 
often increases conversion rates because searchers have a better understanding of your 
company. For example, if you make a claim in your ad copy, such as free shipping, dis-
counts, or a third-party authorization, put that information on your landing page.
Respect the searcher’s computer. Do not alter their browser settings, disable the 
back button, or attempt to autoinstall software. Violating any of these three rules usu-
ally results in your ads quickly becoming disapproved. In addition, autoinstalling soft-
ware may result in your website being marked as untrusted in some privacy software.
In the United States, privacy policies can be tricky. In unregulated industries, 
privacy policies are not legally required. However, if you have one, it becomes a legal 
document. Please note that other countries have their own privacy policy laws, and 
requirements vary by country. If you collect personal information, such as email 
addresses, credit cards, or phone numbers, you must disclose how you use that infor-
mation. You can either include information on the page or link to your privacy policy. 
If you collect credit card information, bank information, or other sensitive data, the 
page must be secure. If you are using Google’s remarketing or similar audience- target-
ing features, you are also required to make appropriate disclosures on your website. If 
you do not follow these rules, you might not just see lower Quality Scores; you can see 
disapproved ads since the pages do not meet the proper disclosure requirements.
In addition, do not automatically sign up users for your newsletters if you collect 
their email address for other purposes, such as sending an e-commerce receipt. Allow a 
user to choose to receive your newsletter.
If you require registration to view the content on your site, allow someone to see 
a preview of the information before they are required to register on your website.
Navigation
If the searcher does not find the information they are looking for on the landing page, 
do you give them alternative ways to find that information? In Chapter 6, “Learning 
Advanced Optimization Techniques,” you learned best practices for dedicated landing 
pages and reasons to include additional navigation to your site from your landing page.
Another reason to add navigational elements is that navigation is a factor in 
determining landing page quality. Your landing page does not have to have your 

■  E st i m at i ng You r F i rst Page Bi d
231
typical full navigation; however, if the consumer does not find what they are looking 
for on your landing page, or if they want to learn more about your company, offers, 
and so forth, can they easily find that information on your website?
Generally, if you have the following links on your landing page, you will meet 
Google’s navigational requirements:
••
Homepage
••
About us page
••
Contact us page
••
More about the product or service
••
Privacy policy
You should avoid pop-ups on the landing page. Hover items that do not open 
new windows are currently acceptable. However, adding pop-ups on load or exit is a 
violation of AdWords policy and will result in disapproved ads and low landing page 
Quality Scores.
Landing page quality is generally considered to have less weighting in the 
Quality Score formula compared to some of the other factors such as CTR. However, a 
low landing page Quality Score can hurt your Quality Score more than any other fac-
tor. A low landing page Quality Score may result in your ad not even showing.
Landing pages used to be relevant or nonrelevant. They were a simple pass/fail 
and did not have degrees of relevance. That changed in 2011, and now making some 
changes to your landing page can increase your Quality Scores.
Since landing page fixes take longer than other types of Quality Score optimiza-
tion such as account organization and ad testing, in the “Landing Page Fixes” section 
we will examine when you should be creating new landing pages versus working on 
other aspects of your account to increase your Quality Scores.
Estimating Your First Page Bid
The first page bid is an approximation of what you need to bid for your ad to be shown 
on page 1. If your bid is below this number, your ad will rarely be shown on page 1. If 
your bid is above this number, your ad will usually be shown on page 1.
This approximation is based on the exact match version of the keyword. You 
may find that phrase match and especially broad match may be shown in much higher 
or lower positions than the exact match version. The search query report, discussed 
in Chapter 16, “AdWords Reports: Extracting Actionable Information,” will provide 
insight into these broad match and phrase match keywords. The first page bid is more 
accurate when your campaign is set to show in only one country.
Bear in mind that competition for ad positions varies regionally; the number of 
advertisers and how they manage their budgets can be quite different from geography 
to geography, and even if you bid higher than the estimated first page bid, there may 

Chapter 7:  Demyst i f y i ng Qua li t y Scor e  ■
232
be places where your ads are not shown on page 1. However, it is a decent number to 
work from when you are looking to ensure that your ads are receiving at least some 
exposure.
You can see your estimated top page bid within AdWords as well. This is the 
approximate CPC it will take for your ads to be displayed above the organic results. 
You can customize the columns to see both of these numbers within your account or 
the AdWords Editor (Figure 7.5).
Figure 7.5  Viewing first page bids in the AdWords Editor
It can be time consuming to look for instances of first page bids within each ad 
group. The easiest way to determine whether your bids are below the first page bid is 
to create a keyword report that includes the current bid and first page bid attributes 
and then download it into Excel. Next, use conditional formatting to locate instances 
where your maximum CPC is lower than your first page or top of page CPCs.
Note:  Excel has a feature called conditional formatting, which lets you change the formatting of a cell or col-
umn based on particular criteria in that Excel file. One use of conditional formatting is to highlight the current bid 
column in red if the current bid number is below the first page bid number. This will allow you to quickly find which 
keyword bids are below the first page bids.
By viewing current bid and first page bids side by side in either Excel or the 
AdWords reports, you can easily determine where your ad is not receiving page 1 
placement.
Just because your current bid is below page 1 does not mean you should raise 
your bid to the page 1 bid amount. You may have keywords that are not profitable on 
page 1 and you may therefore be willing to have them not appear on page 1.
When Google determines page 1 bids, they use most of the Quality Score factors 
listed in the earlier section, “Quality Score Factors for Search.” The factors that are 

■  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k Qua li t y Scor e
233
not used are the ones that require real-time analysis, such as relevance of actual search 
query to the ad copy and keyword.
Understanding the Display Network Quality Score
The Display Network will be analyzed in Chapter 9, “Understanding the Display 
Network”; however, we will touch on Quality Scores for the Display Network here 
because they can be very difficult to work with or even diagnose if you have good or 
poor Quality Scores across the Display Network.
The main thing to know about the Display Network is the ways that Google 
triggers ads:
••
Automatic placements: You choose keywords, topics, interests, or some other 
means of targeting a user, and Google then determines the sites, pages, and apps 
on which to place your ads.
••
Managed placements: You pick the actual sites and ad placement slots where you 
want your ad to appear.
For instance, if you are reading an article on the New York Times website about 
airline travel, you may see a list of travel-based ads marked “Ad Choices.” Some of 
these ads are served based on the article’s content, and others might be served by users 
picking that exact site to serve their ads. Regardless, these ads are not triggered by a 
user conducting a search.
Your Display Network Quality Score is not shown within your account. There is 
generally a correlation between good search Quality Scores and strong network place-
ment or relative CTRs (your CTR in relation to your competitors’). However, this is 
not always true in the Display Network because display advertising is quite different 
from search advertising.
Your Display Network Quality Score determines the following:
••
If an ad will be shown on a particular site
••
The ad’s position on that site
The factors that determine your Display Network Quality Score are as follows:
The Ad’s CTR on That Exact Site and Similar Types of Sites  There are over two million sites in 
Google’s Display Network and millions more individual pages where Google has not 
yet displayed your ad. In deciding whether to place your ad on a Display Network site 
or page, Google evaluates ad CTR performance on sites and pages with similar themes 
to your CPC-based campaigns. Especially for image ads, where Google cannot evaluate 
ad relevancy based on text in the ads, CTR is a more important factor in Quality Score 
calculations.

Chapter 7:  Demyst i f y i ng Qua li t y Scor e  ■
234
CTR on the Display Network is usually much lower than CTR on search campaigns. 
The CTR Google uses to determine Display Network Quality Score is independent of 
your search CTRs.
The Relevance of the Ads and Keywords in Each Ad Group to a Particular Website  Google also examines 
the keywords and ads within an ad group and determines how relevant they are to the 
website where your ad might be shown. The closer these two items are to the website’s 
theme, the more likely your ad will be shown on that site. For CPM campaigns, relevance 
factors are generally more important in Quality Score than CTR, as you might expect.
Landing Page Quality  The landing page quality used for the Display Network is the exact 
same as for the search network described earlier. We examined what makes a quality 
landing page in the section “Landing Page Quality: Making Your Pages Relevant” ear-
lier in this chapter.
Other Factors  The other factors are a catchall of various data points that are similar to 
the ones for search.
These factors are used to determine if an ad is shown across the Display 
Network when you have not chosen specific sites to place your ad, an approach known 
as managed placements. However, when you have chosen specific sites where you want 
your ad displayed, different factors are used to determine whether your ad will be 
shown, and where it will be shown, on those sites.
Quality Score for Managed Placements
With managed placements, you choose exactly the sites where you want your ad to be 
displayed. Since you have chosen these sites, Google does not have to spend as much 
computing power determining the ad group’s relevancy to a website and whether an ad 
is appropriate to be shown on a particular site. Therefore, the factors used in Quality 
Score are different.
If you are bidding CPC (cost per click) on a placement, the two factors used in 
determining if your ad is shown are these:
••
The ad’s CTR on that exact site and similar types of sites
••
Landing page quality
The description of these two factors is the exact same as for the content Quality 
Score factors described earlier.
When managing placements across the Display Network, you have an option to 
pay by CPM (cost per thousand impressions) instead of the usual cost per click. With 
CPM bidding, Google knows exactly how much they will make when your ad is shown 
because you are paying for each impression; therefore, they do not need to determine 
how likely your ad is to be clicked so they can get paid. This means that most of the 
relevancy factors do not come into play.

■  Di agnosi ng You r Qua li t y Scor e s
235
For CPM bidding on the Display Network, the only factor that is used to deter-
mine the Quality Score is landing page quality.
Since click-through rate is a major component of Quality Score, a good way to 
get a rough proxy to your display Quality Score is to examine your relative CTR. Your 
relative CTR is your CTR in relation to other ads. You can see this number at a cam-
paign or ad group level. You cannot see it by keyword, placement, or ad. Therefore, 
just as with search, creating small, tightly themed ad groups (such as one topic or inter-
est per ad group) will allow you to see relative CTRs for these small targeting options 
to see where you are doing better and worse across the Display Network.
Since there are so many places where Google stores and utilizes data to deter-
mine if, when, and where your ad should be shown, the first step to optimizing Quality 
Score is to identify where you want to increase your exposure (and decrease click 
prices). Once you have figured out where you want to increase exposure, examine the 
factors that make up the Quality Score for that specific exposure type and work within 
those variables. (See Chapter 9 for more on managed placements.)
If you are in doubt about working with Quality Scores for search or for display, 
default to search. Quality Scores play a pivotal role for search campaign optimiza-
tions. Display Network Quality Scores, on the other hand, are not so easy to use, since 
Google never shows them to you in any reports and you never know if you are improv-
ing them or not. For this reason, while it is important to understand that they exist and 
have an impact on your Display Network performance, there are other signals you have 
to rely on for display campaign optimization, as we’ll discuss in upcoming chapters.
Now that we have looked at how Quality Score is determined for different 
aspects of your account, let’s dig deeper into Google’s mantra—relevance.
Diagnosing Your Quality Scores
Spending all day looking for low Quality Scores, clicking on the text box to see the 
detailed Quality Score information, and then trying to reorganize your ad groups or 
write new ad copy can be a daunting task. There is a more efficient way to spend your 
time by isolating the problem areas:
	 1.	
Run a keyword report that includes at least these seven columns:
••
Campaign
••
Ad group
••
Keyword
••
Cost
••
Quality Score
••
Impressions
••
Clicks

Chapter 7:  Demyst i f y i ng Qua li t y Scor e  ■
236
	 2.	
Once you become familiar with this method, you may wish to add conversion 
data to the process.
	 3.	
After you have run the report, export the data into Excel.
	 4.	
Create a pivot table using your keyword report as the data source.
Creating Pivot Tables
A pivot table summarizes data sets. Using pivot tables is an easy way to combine many data points 
into a higher-level data set that makes it easy to analyze the data.
Creating pivot tables in Excel takes just seconds. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Import the data into Excel.
	 2.	 Delete all rows above the title row (the row that contains the label keyword, ad group, Quality 
Score, and so on).
	 3.	 Go to the Insert tab, and click the PivotTable button (on the far left of the ribbon).
	 4.	 Make sure that the entire sheet is selected, and then click OK.
A new worksheet will be created that contains the pivot table information.
You can find Microsoft help files for creating pivot tables at http://office.microsoft.com/
en-us/excel/HP101773841033.aspx.
With pivot tables, you can choose to see the average Quality Score of an ad 
group. However, when you look at the average Quality Score by ad group, each key-
word is given the same weight regardless of clicks and impressions. For instance, if 
your ad group contained these statistics
Keyword
Impressions
Quality Score
Keyword 1
1000
4
Keyword 2
10
7
Keyword 3
1
10
the average Quality Score of this ad group would be 7—that is, (4 + 7 + 10) ÷ 3.
However, if you weighted the Quality Score of this ad group by impressions, you 
would have a much different picture. If you take a keyword’s impressions multiplied 
by its Quality Score, add these numbers together for all keywords within the ad group, 
and then divide by the ad group’s total impressions
Weighted QS = ((1000 × 4) + (10 × 7) + (1 × 10)) ÷ 1011
you would see that this ad group really has a Quality Score of 4.03, not 7.

■  Di agnosi ng You r Qua li t y Scor e s
237
The reason to work with the weighted average is that you are going to create a 
pivot table that will let you find places where you have low Quality Scores and high 
spends. Therefore, once you have your keyword report imported into Excel, add one 
more column labeled QS * Impressions. To populate this column, create a formula that 
multiplies the keyword’s Quality Score by its impressions.
Note:  Tools are available that will do all of this analysis for you, and they’ll even go a step beyond and put 
these ad groups in order of importance. One I created, called the Quality Score Analyzer (http://certified-
knowledge.org/membership-information/ppc-tools/quality-score-analyzer/), uses 
algorithms to find the best places to optimize your Quality Scores based on impression volume, normalized Quality 
Score, and spend data.
Now create the pivot table. Once the pivot table is created, use ad groups as 
the rows, and Sum of Impressions, Sum of QS * Impressions, and Sum of Cost as the 
columns.
Finally, create a column for real Quality Score where you look at the weighted 
average. All you need to do is divide the Sum of QS * Impressions by Sum of 
Impressions. This will create a column that shows you your real Quality Score. When 
you have finished, you should have a pivot table that looks like Figure 7.6.
Figure 7.6  Pivot table with weighted Quality Score and cost data

Chapter 7:  Demyst i f y i ng Qua li t y Scor e  ■
238
What you want to look for is ad groups with both high spends and low Quality 
Scores. In Figure 7.6, Ad Group 442 has the highest spend in a low Quality Score ad 
group. That is the best ad group for you to spend your time optimizing. The second ad 
group to examine would be 701 because its Quality Score is very low at under 3 and 
yet is one of the top-spending ad groups in the account. As you become more familiar 
with pivot tables, you can add additional data points such as conversions or ROAS 
(return on ad spend) to the table. This table will not tell you what to do. It will present 
summary information that should be easy to analyze to find a starting place for your 
optimizations. Looking at ad group data is easier than looking at tens of thousands of 
keyword Quality Scores.
Once you have found ad groups with high spends and low Quality Scores, 
navigate to these ad groups in your AdWords account and click on the dialog boxes 
(Figure 7.3) to see what the problems are with those keywords.
Finding Areas of Low Performance
The first pivot table created shows you areas where you can optimize your current 
spend. However, it does not tell you where your Quality Scores are so low that you’re 
not actually spending any money.
In order to see ad groups where you have many low Quality Score keywords, 
create a pivot table that shows you your ad groups and the number of keywords in each 
ad group (which is displayed as Count in a pivot table), and then create a report filter to 
include only keywords with Quality Scores of 4 or less, as shown in Figure 7.7.
Figure 7.7  Pivot table showing ad groups with low Quality Score keywords
In this case, you will want to take the steps outlined in the section “Increasing 
Quality Scores.” If the issue is not landing page relevance, the main steps will be exam-
ining your account’s organization and trying to lift CTRs with ad copy testing.
Viewing CTRs
An easy way to see if you have a typical account in terms of CTR being your major QS 
factor is to create a chart that shows your CTR by Quality Score (Figure 7.8).

■  Di agnosi ng You r Qua li t y Scor e s
239
Figure 7.8  Pivot table showing  
CTRs by Quality Score
It is very common to see a linear progression where the higher your CTR, the 
higher your Quality Scores are. Although this is not always linear, it is not uncommon 
to see QS 6 words with a lower CTR than QS 5 words or some other random anomaly. 
This usually happens because you will have some keywords that may have low Quality 
Scores, but they have higher average positions. If you have a very large account with a 
lot of data, then you can also segment your Quality Score by average position and then 
examine your CTRs by taking into account both position and Quality Score.
If your chart does not show a reasonably linear correlation between Quality 
Scores and CTR, this may be an indication that you have ad relevancy or landing pages 
problems throughout the account. In those cases, you may need to readdress your 
entire ad copy creation or landing page strategy to increase your Quality Scores.
Healthy Quality Score Accounts
When you have so many keywords—some with low Quality Scores, some with high 
Quality Scores, others with high CPAs, and others that are barely making money—
how do you determine the Quality Score of your overall account?
There is another way of using pivot table data to see a quick snapshot of an 
account. Instead of examining ad groups, look at the number of impressions by each 
Quality Score number (Figure 7.9).
Figure 7.9  Quality Score impressions for an account

Chapter 7:  Demyst i f y i ng Qua li t y Scor e  ■
240
In a healthy account, you want roughly 50 percent of your impressions to be 
Quality Score 7 or higher and roughly 70 percent to be Quality Score 6 or higher. 
Google calculates revenue based on impressions, not keywords, so the percentage of 
your impressions at each Quality Score number is a more important signal to Google 
about your overall account than the percentage of keywords that fall into each Quality 
Score number. In this account, the percentage of keywords that are Quality Score 7 
or higher is under 33 percent; therefore, they need to be more aggressive in trying to 
increase their Quality Scores.
When creating these charts, if you have a large percentage of brand terms, you 
will want to do the chart for both brand and non-brand terms. If you see low Quality 
Scores or low CTRs on your brand terms, that is an indication that your brand strat-
egy needs to be addressed. If you see high Quality Scores on your brand terms and low 
ones on your non-brand terms, then you need to address your generic keyword strat-
egy. Some companies spend a lot of money on brand terms, because these keywords 
usually have such high CTRs and Quality Scores. However, brand and non-brand 
terms are expected to behave quite differently, and therefore it is always useful to 
examine these two account aspects independently.
You may have additional segments to pay attention to as well. If you have an 
e-commerce site, then you may want to manage your own brand’s keywords differ-
ently than third-party brands you carry and both of those segments differently from 
generic keyword terms. This is not only for Quality Score diagnostic reasons but also 
to see your conversion rates and cost per sale across the various types of terms in your 
account.
If this account had 80 percent of their impressions at Quality Score 7 or higher, 
they could easily keep some low Quality Score keywords in their account without wor-
rying about how those keywords would affect their account.
If you’re in doubt about Quality Score optimization—assuming there’s no prob-
lem with the landing page—try to increase your CTR.
Pivot tables are powerful analysis tools whenever you have so many data points 
that it is hard to spot problems easily. By summarizing the Quality Score data, you can 
find the weaknesses in your account and then investigate and optimize the ad groups in 
question.
Ignoring Quality Score
There are times when working with Quality Score can lead you in the wrong direction. 
Here are the three main times when you want to ignore Quality Score:
••
Google isn’t calculating it correctly (bugs).
••
You don’t have enough data.
••
Your industry is just messy (mostly finance, pharmaceutical, and legal).

■  Di agnosi ng You r Qua li t y Scor e s
241
With each of these scenarios you shouldn’t give up before you try. You might try 
a few variations of ads, split out the keywords into their own ad group with their own 
ad and landing page, and other such strategies. And after a few rounds of tests, if you 
can’t make the Quality Scores, then you should walk away.
I’ll walk through the main issues I see when I work with a low Quality Score 
keyword, what tests you can run, and when you should just walk away and not obsess 
over it after you have done some testing.
Word Variations  These scenarios are probably the most maddening. Certain words don’t 
have different CPCs, CTRs, or conversion rates by plural, singular, or various stems. 
Yet, the Quality Scores are completely different for each variation.
Plurals and singulars:
••
Your singular (or plural) is a 7–10.
••
The reverse, your plural (or singular) is a 3–4.
••
For example: The word accident attorney is a 7–10; the word accident 
attorneys is a 4.
Stemming:
••
The word is a 7–10.
••
Any stem is a 3–4.
••
For example: Gardening tools is a 10 and garden tools is a 3–4.
Reverse words:
••
Accident attorney is a 7–10.
••
Attorney accident is a 3–4.
With these words, if your CTRs, CPCs, and average position are similar for both varia-
tions, then after a few tests walk away. I can’t count the number of wasted hours I’ve 
seen on these tests.
You Don’t Have Enough Impressions  This is one of the biggest mistakes I see. Someone adds 
100 new keywords, immediately gets 3s, and then starts to worry about it.
Or, someone adds 1000 keywords, waits 24 hours, sees lots of 4s, and starts testing 
when no keyword has more than 30 impressions.
Your keywords do not start with your Quality Score. They start with an average that is 
tempered by your overall Quality Score.
Don’t even look at Quality Score until you have 500 impressions. If it’s a higher-vol-
ume term, then wait until you have 1000–2000 at a minimum. The lone exception is 
when you see below-average landing page experience. In that case, take a look at your 
organization and landing pages.
It’s Just Your Industry  Some industries have had such a plethora of bad traffic bought 
within them that no one can get a good Quality Score. This can be maddening because 

Chapter 7:  Demyst i f y i ng Qua li t y Scor e  ■
242
you think you should have 7s, but no matter what you do, you can’t break 3–4. Some 
accounts are in great shape with an average Quality Score of 3.5. This is not common. 
I’ll show you how to diagnose it.
One common scenario you may encounter is high positions but low Quality Scores 
(Figure 7.10).
Figure 7.10  Low Quality scores and high positions
If you see this scenario, then take a look at the top vs. other segmentation for those 
keywords and see if you have a lot of your impressions in the top range. Google does 
not put bad ads above the organic results. Therefore, if you see your ad above the 
organics, and you have Quality Score 3 and 4 words, the problem is most likely your 
industry. This is very common in these industries:
••
Financial
••
Pharmaceutical
••
Legal
••
Industries with average CPCs above $35–$50 (and commonly in the $100-
plus range).
With keywords in these industries, there is one big issue:
••
At a QS 3, your ads can be above the organics and show all the time.
••
At a QS 2, your ads are rarely shown.
There is a huge difference between a 2 and a 3 Quality Score. Therefore, you will want 
to get to 3s. A 4 is good (consider it a 7), and a 5 is great (consider it a 10); rarely does 
anyone have an actual 7 to 10.
Words with Other Meanings  Not everything means what you think it does. Many words 
have multiple meanings, and this can cause low Quality Scores due to low CTRs. 
You usually don’t want to fix them because doing so means you get lots of unquali-
fied visitors and your conversion rate suffers. A good example of this is the bleach 

■  I ncr e asi ng Qua li t y Scor e s
243
query example from earlier chapters, where bleach could mean a cleaning supply or a 
Japanese anime show.
In these cases, you’ll rarely get a great CTR. You can do lots of negatives, but be pre-
pared to have some low CTR or to use such generic ads that your conversion rates suf-
fer. Always know who is searching on your ads—you don’t always want a high QS if 
you lose money by having one.
It’s Someone’s Local Brand  Quality Scores are reported at the keyword level. Quality Score 
takes into account geographic and ad CTRs. If you are advertising on a word that is 
a brand, you might have a low CTR in some regions and a great one in other regions. 
You will see just the average. In this case, you often end up with a low Quality Score if 
that brand has enough of the search queries and clicks in the majority of other regions.
It’s a Common URL  There are a surprising number of searches for URLs or common com-
pany names. Not everyone directly goes to a website (often called direct navigation). 
It’s pretty common to see people search for a site and then click the link to go to the 
site. Therefore, if you are advertising on a word that matches someone else’s website, 
you could see low Quality Scores.
Bugs  Google launches Quality Score changes on a regular basis, and sometimes bugs 
in the programming occur. The easiest way to spot these is that your average position 
and actual CPCs have not changed at all, but your Quality Scores have dramatically 
decreased. In these cases, since your ad rank and costs have not been affected, it is 
sometimes due to a bug in the system. There is nothing you can do about this situation 
until Google corrects the issue. The good news is that since your costs are usually not 
affected, these bugs do not usually cost you additional money.
Fortunately, if you are in one of these scenarios, then odds are your competitors 
are too and no one is actually getting an advantage. If you are in one of these situa-
tions, do not just immediately give up and say you cannot get a good Quality Score. 
You will want to do a bit of testing and examination of organization before you give up 
because you might be the exception for those keywords or industry.
Increasing Quality Scores
The first step to increasing Quality Scores is understanding where you need to increase 
your Quality Scores. The second step is taking action on that knowledge.
There are also ways in which you can structure your account that usually lead to 
high Quality Scores when you begin, and therefore you will have fewer account struc-
ture issues to work through in trying to increase Quality Scores. The first step to creat-
ing a good account is creating highly relevant ad groups. If you are diagnosing your 
Quality Scores and find ad groups that need Quality Score improvement, this same 
technique is used: create highly relevant ad groups.

Chapter 7:  Demyst i f y i ng Qua li t y Scor e  ■
244
Creating Highly Relevant Ad Groups
Relevance is a subjective word, and yet being relevant determines much about your 
account’s success. There are four main places where Google attempts to ascertain 
relevance:
••
Keyword to ad copy
••
Ad copy to landing page
••
Keyword to landing page
••
Ad copy and keyword to Display Network sites
In these four instances, you might not be able to quantify relevance; however, 
you can conduct exercises and research to help ensure you are coming close to meeting 
Google’s relevance guidelines.
The most time-consuming exercise, and the one that will give your account the 
best chance of long-term success, is successful account organization. Make no mistake, 
this organization will take time, but the rewards are worth the effort. Not only will 
creating tightly themed ad groups where the ad copy is closely related to the keywords 
lead to a higher Quality Score due to Google’s relevancy algorithms, but it will also 
lead to higher click-through rates, which is the major component in your Quality Score.
To begin, write one highly targeted ad—an ad that does not have to be used 
within your account but that if a searcher reads it, they could only assume that it 
describes exactly one service or product. After you write this ad, examine the key-
words within that ad group. If the ad copy describes those keywords, that means the 
keywords are in the correct ad group. If the ad copy does not describe the keywords, 
the keywords need to be in a new ad group.
The best organization possible would be to write one ad for one keyword. This 
way, the keyword and the ad copy are always closely related. However, that is not usu-
ally possible due to the restrictions on how many ad groups can be in a campaign and 
the fact that it would take significantly more time than the vast majority of people 
have. Therefore, it is much better to have 10 ad groups of 10 keywords that are closely 
related than 1 ad group of 100 keywords that are only marginally related.
It is common to see an ad such as
John’s Plumbing Service
Servicing the Chicago area
Call for an appointment today!
to be shown for an ad group with these keywords within it:
••
Chicago plumbing
••
Plumbing service
••
Broken pipes
••
Emergency plumbing

■  I ncr e asi ng Qua li t y Scor e s
245
••
24-hour plumbing
••
Fix shower
••
Overflowing toilet
••
Saturday plumbing
••
Weekend plumbing
••
Flooded basement
The common argument is that plumbers offer all of these services; therefore, 
you need to write only one ad to describe all these keywords. The truth is that while 
you might have some keywords that are fairly generic (such as plumbing) where this 
ad copy would serve, the account would be much better served to break this copy into 
more targeted ad groups.
An emergency plumber is one who is willing to come to a house at 3:00 a.m. on 
Tuesday. You might want to hire a weekend plumber who will not charge double time 
for the visit to your house. Instead of using a single ad, consider the ads and keywords 
shown in Table 7.2.

This granular grouping of keywords and ad copy will allow you to write ads 
that truly reflect your keywords. In addition, because your ad groups now contain only 
a single theme, it is easier to pick (or create) the landing page on your website that best 
reflects your keywords. Almost every ad group will use a different landing page.
You may see higher conversion rates when you use ad copy and landing pages 
that are closely related to the search query, but that will not inherently increase your 
Quality Score.
By organizing your account in this manner, it is common to see these results:
••
Higher click-through rates
••
Higher relevancy
••
Higher Quality Scores
••
Higher conversion rates
••
Lower cost per lead
••
Lower cost per click

Compared to accounts that are organized in the original manner described that 
contain one ad and a handful of semi-related keywords, this might take some time, but 
it is some of the best time investment you can make with your account.
If you have some ad groups that are not highly relevant to all the keywords in 
the ad group, then you will want to take the non-relevant keywords out of that ad 
group and either add them to an existing one that does describe that keyword well or 
create a new ad group for those keywords with highly relevant ads and landing pages.
Once you have done that a few times, you will not be able to create even more 
granular ad groups, so the next step to increasing Quality Scores is ad testing.
Ad Testing to Increase Quality Scores
In Chapter 15, “Implementing Testing Techniques That Will Increase Profits,” we will 
examine ad testing in detail. However, since a great part of your Quality Scores is ad 
relevance and expected CTR, you can address those two areas through ad testing.
If you see that your expected CTR is low, then you can create entirely new ads 
or just make incremental changes to your existing ads in an attempt to increase your 
Quality Scores.
If you see that your ad relevance is below average, then you should start with 
entirely new ads to try to increase the relevance.
While those are general guidelines, you also need to take a look at your current 
ad serving to see if just deleting ads could increase your Quality Scores. For instance, 
if you have several ads in an ad group, then your Quality Score is the average of your 
CTR and relevancy to all the ads combined for that keyword. If you have several ads 
with low CTRs and some with high CTRs in the same ad group (Figure 7.11), just 
pausing or deleting your worst performing ads can increase your Quality Scores.
The percentage served is how often that ad was served based up the level of detail 
(account, campaign, or ad group) that you are examining. Figure 7.11 is the ad-served 
percentage of ads within a single ad group. Please note that this percentage served is 
based on the date range of data that you are examining. If you are examining the past 
month of data, and one of the ads has been live for only a single week, it will naturally 
have a low ad-served percentage because it was eligible to receive impressions only for 
roughly 25 percent of the time frame you are examining. Therefore, it is useful to exam-
ine ad-served percentage data based on date ranges when all the ads were active.
In this case, the highest CTR ad is being served only 33 percent of the time. 
Just by deleting the other ads, your Quality Score could increase. Now, please note 
that your main metric may be conversion rates or cost per conversion, in which case 
deleting the lower CTR ads may be deleting your highest conversion rate ads. There 
is a balance to be had between increasing Quality Score and putting money in your 
bank account. If you are ever in doubt, pick the ad that puts the most money in 
your bank account.

Mobile vs. Desktop Optimization
When you are examining your ads for CTR purposes, you should also segment them 
by device (Figure 7.12). It is not uncommon to see that one ad has the best mobile CTR 
and another one has the best desktop CTR. If you examine the combined metrics, then 
you will not see this difference.

Landing Page Fixes
Landing pages are tricky to work with in AdWords because they take more work to fix 
than just writing a new ad or rearranging ad groups. Since landing pages have a large 
range of what is average, below average, and above average, it is possible to have a 10 
Quality Score even with a below-average landing page.
Here are the general rules for landing page fixes:
••
If your landing page is below average, and both your ad relevancy and expected 
CTR are above average, then you will want to work on your landing page to 
increase your Quality Score.
••
If your landing page is below average, and both expected CTR and ad relevance 
are average or below average, then your first step would be to test ads to try to 
increase your expected CTR and ad relevance before you start working on fixing 
landing pages.
••
If your landing page is below average, and one of the other two factors is above 
average and the other is average, you can choose either to work on the landing 
page or to test ads.
If you realize that you need to fix your landing page, do not immediately start 
coding a new version. You will want to do one more analysis: examine your bounce 
rates and time on site by device (Figure 7.13).
Figure 7.13  Landing page metrics by device

■  W h at to Do i f You r Qua li t y Scor e Drops

If you see that your bounce rates for a keyword are very high or your time on 
site is very low on one device but not on another, then you need to fix only the landing 
page for that device and not the page as a whole. If you are using responsive design, 
this might be more difficult since your same pages are used on both devices. If you have 
separate sites by device, then making changes to a page for each device is much easier.
When examining pages that need Quality Score improvements, do not just 
examine time on site and bounce rates but also look at the major factors discussed ear-
lier in the chapter that affect your landing page Quality Score.
What to Do if Your Quality Score Drops
There will be times when your Quality Score may suddenly drop. In these cases, there 
are some steps you can follow to find the problem and try to fix it.
The very first step is to look at the Quality Score pop-up (refer back to 
Figure 7.3) to see if Google will let you know what the problem is. However, the prob-
lem will not always be listed.
A good corporate practice is to make sure your company has a communication 
system between your IT and marketing departments. It’s possible that IT has launched 
a new version of the website and has broken your URLs. In this case, you are sending 
traffic to error pages. If you also have an SEO (search engine optimization) depart-
ment, make sure there is communication with this department because they might have 
instituted rewrites, modified a robots.txt file, or made other changes to your website 
that could affect your Quality Score. Having a record of website changes, and prepar-
ing for website changes, can save you many headaches at a later date.
It is a good idea to track historical Quality Score so that you can see how the 
changes you implement in your account increase or decrease Quality Score. This will 
give you insight into how your changes affect your Quality Scores.
Quality Score is considered an attribute in AdWords. Any data point that is an 
attribute is not tracked over time within AdWords. For instance, you cannot see your 
historical max CPCs in AdWords because max CPC is considered an attribute. Google 
tracks only metrics, such as conversion rate, over time.
Since Google considers Quality Score an attribute, when you run a report in 
AdWords, the Quality Score listed is the number at that exact moment in time. You 
cannot see previous Quality Scores within AdWords, so you need to keep track of your 
own historical Quality Scores.
You can schedule a report to be automatically run (Figure 7.14). Set up a key-
word report that includes your Quality Score to be created on a regular basis (usually 
weekly) so that you have an archive of your keywords and Quality Scores. Google does 
not email these reports, but they will email you a notification that the report has been 
created. You can always navigate to the Reports section and download these reports.

Figure 7.14  Schedule reports to be sent to you automatically.
When you find that a Quality Score has dropped, look through your reports to 
find the time frame where the drop occurred. Once you have isolated the time frame, 
use the Change History tool (Figure 7.15) to see what changes were made in your 
account during that time. You will find times when new destination URLs, ad changes, 
or campaign changes affected your Quality Score.
Figure 7.15  Change History tool
If you have yet to turn up a reason for the lower Quality Score, examine the 
natural search results. Has the keyword changed in search intent? In Chapter 2, 
“Performing Keyword Research,” you saw an example of the word bleach having a 
higher search volume for the anime show than for the cleaning product. There are 
many examples of news stories, new products, and new services changing the meaning 
of a word, which could result in changes to that keyword’s Quality Score.

The AdWords Editor (featured in Chapter 12) allows you to keep notes associ-
ated with data points in your account. Using the AdWords Editor notes helps you keep 
track of your changes, reasons, and investigations into Quality Score changes.
There will be times when none of these investigations turns up a reason for that 
change. If the Quality Score box does not list a reason for the low Quality Score, your 
landing page, keyword, and ad copy should be relevant. In these situations, the best 
steps to take are the ones you take to improve the Quality Score in the first place:
••
Check your ad group organization. Can it be more granularly organized?
••
Does your CTR vary widely by geography? You can determine this by looking at 
geographic performance reports (covered in Chapter 11). If so, use geo-targeted 
campaigns to write more effective ad copy.
••
Does your CTR vary widely by time of day, day of week, or even days of the 
month? If so, try utilizing ad scheduling (see Chapter 13, “Devising Profitable 
Bid Strategies”).
••
Test new ads. Determine if a different ad has either a higher CTR or higher rel-
evancy, which will raise the Quality Score.
If Google does not give you a reason for the lower Quality Score, that almost 
always means you need to increase relevancy or CTR. Focus on those two items to see 
what combinations of ad delivery, ad copy, and keyword usage increase your Quality 
Score. However, never forget your profit. There may be times when a campaign is 
highly profitable and you make a business decision that working with lower Quality 
Scores is acceptable for your account.
Quality Score FAQs
There are a handful of questions that always present themselves when Quality Score is 
being discussed.
What happens if a keyword or ad is paused or deleted?  When a keyword or ad copy is paused or 
deleted, it does not accrue impressions. If no data is being collected, this ad copy or 
keyword does not currently affect your Quality Score.
Can I save this keyword?  If you have a keyword that has not done well for you but you 
believe in it and want to run it, then, yes, you can save it. Most recent history matters 
more than all-time history. If you have a problem keyword, do this:
	
1.	
Delete it everywhere in your account. This will help you isolate its 
appearance.
	
2.	
Create a new ad group with just that keyword.
	
3.	
Write a few highly targeted ads for just that keyword, and send the traffic to 
a relevant landing page.

Chapter 7:  Demyst i f y i ng Qua li t y Scor e  ■
252
It will take some work, but if the keyword is relevant to your business, you should be 
able to make it work.
When reorganizing my account, what keywords should I move?  You have two options; the first is 
just to move the low Quality Score keywords. However, if you need to reorganize your 
account, just do it. It used to be that you lost so much history that reorganizing an 
account was a drastic measure. That is no longer true; the gains you get from better 
organization outweigh any short-term losses that may occur when you move keywords 
around or create new ads.
Can’t I just buy my way out of trouble?  Relevancy trumps money at Google. If your ads are 
completely irrelevant, your dollars will not help you to increase Quality Scores. Spend 
your money on creating a more relevant experience on your website and writing appro-
priate ads. You will have much better success in this manner.
However, the one exception is that Google is not always good at normalizing the 
CTR between the top and the side of the page. You might see a keyword with a 5 
Quality Score when it’s on the side of the page and a 7 when it’s at the top of the page. 
Sometimes, just by raising bids to go from the side to the top of the page can increase 
Quality Scores. This is not always true, especially if your ads are not relevant, but this 
scenario does happen on occasion.
I resumed a paused keyword and it dropped in position and Quality Score; what happened?  Pausing and 
resuming keywords or ad copy does not affect your Quality Score. Pausing campaigns 
will not affect your Quality Score. It is not uncommon to see new competitors enter 
the market, changes in keyword meanings that change searcher intent, and changes 
in Quality Score formulas occur over time. When you resume a keyword, it may drop 
in position due to the new competitors driving up the keyword price or a new Quality 
Score formula being released.
How do I get my ad above the natural search results?  Sometimes you will see no ads above the 
search results, and other times you may see several ads (Figure 7.16) in that same spot. 
There are two things that need to happen for your ads to show in the top spot:
	
1.	
Google examines a keyword for commercial intent and how often that key-
word results in clicks (and some other secret sauces) and determines how 
many ads they might show in these premium positions.
	
2.	
Assuming Google has decided to show at least one ad in the premium posi-
tion, they look at your max CPC and Quality Score.
Your Quality Score is held to a higher standard than normal and must meet certain 
minimum guidelines for your ad to be shown in these top positions. If your keyword 
meets the minimum Quality Score guidelines, Google examines your max CPC. If the 
combination of your max CPC and Quality Score are high enough, your ad can be 
shown in the top spot.

■  Qua li t y Scor e FAQs
253
Figure 7.16  Premium ads shown on Google
If your Quality Score and CPC do not meet their minimum requirements to be shown 
in the top position, and your competitor’s ad in a lower position does meet those 
requirements, Google may leapfrog your competitor’s ad over yours and display it in 
the premium position.
How often is Quality Score updated?  The Quality Score that Google uses in the auction 
is updated in real time. Google currently updates Quality Score in regard to click-
through rate every day for most keywords. Very high impression words may be 
updated more than once per day. However, the keywords are not all updated at the 
same time. You might have some keywords in an ad group updated at 9 a.m. and oth-
ers updated at 1:30 p.m.
Google updates Quality Score in regard to relevancy about once per week. Google 
updates landing page data even less frequently.
Google crawls landing pages on occasion; the more traffic you receive, the more often 
your site is crawled. When your landing page changes have been processed, the changes 
should be reflected within your account the next time Quality Score is updated.
Google updates the Quality Score algorithm about once per month. These are slight 
tweaks to the algorithm that may or may not affect your account.
Quality Score was created to ensure that Google shows searchers relevant ads 
and sends those searchers to websites that help them find the answers to their search 
queries. While there are some factors and rules that can be quantified to help you opti-
mize your keywords for higher Quality Scores, always keep the searcher in mind when 
making changes to your ad copy and landing pages.

Chapter 7:  Demyst i f y i ng Qua li t y Scor e  ■
254
Google tries to show the most appropriate ads to each searcher, but the searchers 
also vote by clicking on your ads. Since click-through rate is the highest weighted fac-
tor in determining Quality Score, those clicks ultimately decide if your keywords will 
receive high Quality Scores.
Best Practices for Optimizing Quality Scores
Quality Score is one of the most important numbers you can understand and optimize 
in your account. While the number can seem ambiguous to work with, once you under-
stand these principles, it is a number that can be quantified and improved.
••
To increase your ad rank, you need to raise your bid, increase your Quality 
Scores, or change your ad extensions.
••
If you have a low Quality Score, you should optimize your Quality Score 
instead of raising bids.
••
If you are not using ad extensions, you need to create them.
••
If your Quality Score is high and you are using ad extensions, then you need 
to raise your maximum CPC. When raising your maximum CPC, always 
make sure the new bid does not make your keyword unprofitable.
••
It is essential that you create granular ad groups with closely related keywords 
and ad copy.
••
To make your landing page relevant, make sure it possesses the following five 
attributes:
••
Spiderability: Ensure that Google’s bots can find and read your landing 
pages.
••
Relevance: Your landing page must reflect the keyword or its general theme.
••
Transparency: Tell the searcher what you will do with their private 
information.
••
Navigation: Enable the searcher to navigate to other sections of your website 
if they do not find what they are looking for on the landing page.
••
Load time: Ensure that your site loads quickly.
••
It is useful to always have your Quality Score displayed in your account and the 
AdWords Editor so you can easily notice Quality Score changes.
••
Look for areas where your first page bid is higher than your maximum CPC. 
These words receive little exposure, and raising the maximum CPC or optimiz-
ing their Quality Score will help raise their ad rank so they appear on page 1.
••
Your Quality Score will change over time. This is due to your keywords and 
ad copy accruing more data from clicks or from Google updating their Quality 
Score algorithm. Use the My Change History tool, AdWords Editor notes, and 
report scheduling to keep historical data about your account.

When trying to increase Quality Scores for search, there are three main steps:
	
1.	
Examine the detailed Quality Score information inside your AdWords 
account. If you identify a problem there, fix that problem first.
	
2.	
If no problems are listed, examine your ad group’s ad copy and keyword 
organization. Move any unrelated words to a new ad group.
	
3.	
If keywords in the ad group are already closely related, write new ad copy to 
examine its relevance and click-through rate.
••
Your Display Network Quality Score is not shown by Google. However, you can 
still optimize your Display Network Quality Score by creating tightly themed ad 
groups and examining your relative CTR.
••
Use pivot tables to save time in identifying Quality Score problem areas.
By following these principles, you should be able to track your Quality Scores 
and changes over time. Then, when you find areas that can be improved, you can 
improve your Quality Score, which will lead to higher ad position or a decrease in cost 
per click.
Up to this point in the book, I have primarily focused on text ads and the search 
network. In the next chapter, I will cover some of the additional ad types found in 
Google AdWords, such as video and image ads, which are shown not on search but 
across the Display Network.

Mobile usage has been rising and is a challenge 
for marketers who seek to reach and engage this 
audience. Google AdWords also supports sev-

ways. Rich media (such as video, interactive, or

brand recall.
Building rich media ads can be costly and 
time consuming. This chapter examines how you 
can build rich media ads within the AdWords

Beyond the Desktop: Creating Mobile Ads
Mobile users have different needs than people on a desktop computer. They often want 
different information when they are out in the community than when they are at home 
or in the office. For example, if someone searches for the brand Best Buy while on the 
computer, they may be looking for an actual location, to purchase an item, or for price 
comparison. If that same user is looking up Best Buy on a mobile phone, the searcher is 
most likely not looking to buy an item over the phone (e-commerce activity on mobile 
devices is still quite low compared to desktops, and much of it occurs in apps and not 
via browsers, although the numbers are climbing year over year). On a phone, it is 
more likely that the user is either comparing prices or trying to find the nearest loca-
tion. In this case, the landing pages could be completely different for the mobile search 
versus the desktop search.
The desktop search will take someone to Best Buy’s main website, where the 
user can decide where to go on the site. For a mobile phone user, waiting for a site to 
load and then trying to search throughout a website can be a frustrating experience. 
Sending the mobile user to a landing page that has driving directions or location look-
ups for the nearest locations as a primary action and then viewing products as a sec-
ondary action can lead to a higher user engagement for that mobile site.
As another example, someone searching for a locksmith on a desktop computer 
might want to know more about locks, pricing options, redoing the locks on their front 
door, or maybe adding an alarm system to their house. You do not know the intent of 
such a general search. However, if someone is on the phone searching for locksmiths, 
that user is probably locked out of their car or house. Those two experiences should be 
met with two different landing pages.
For many businesses, mobile advertising is highly effective, especially if gener-
ating phone calls is your primary desired conversion activity. Before starting mobile 
advertising, first think about the reasons someone might search for your products or 
services from a mobile phone. Once you have those pieces of information, some of the 
later decisions you will make in setting up mobile campaigns will be easier.
There are a few ways to reach mobile users with Google AdWords, depending 
on the user’s mobile technology. The sophistication of the user’s phone will determine 
what type of ads they can see and what type of ad you need to create to reach them.
Reaching Smartphone Users
Two types of browsers come installed on mobile phones:
••
A full Internet browser, also called a full HTML browser
••
A basic browser that does not display entire websites (these browsers rarely sup-
port scripts)

■  Beyon d t h e De sktop: Cr e at i ng Mobi le A ds
259
The full HTML browser is the type that an iPhone, Windows phone, or Android 
device has. These browsers can support scripts that enable websites to render similarly 
to what you would see in a desktop browser.
However, cell phone speeds are often slower than broadband speeds, and while 
phones have made great strides in memory and processing, they do not compare to 
their desktop counterparts. Therefore, web elements such as large images, scripts, and 
so on can take a long time to load. When designing landing pages for smartphone 
users, keep in mind the total time it will take for your page to load on a mobile device. 
Most users understand that it takes a few more seconds for a mobile page to load than 
a desktop page, but if the page takes too long, these users will navigate back to the 
search results and visit someone else’s website instead of yours.
In addition, not all full HTML browsers support Flash or all web elements. Be 
careful not to add too many design parameters to mobile landing pages even if the user 
has a full HTML browser.
 By default, your ad will be displayed on all devices (desktops, tablets, and 
mobile devices). If you wish to prevent ads from being displayed on mobile devices, you 
will need to use bid modifiers to accomplish this action.
Bid modifiers will be covered in depth in Chapter 13, “Devising Profitable 
Bid Strategies”; however, at a conceptual level they are positive or negative modifiers 
that are applied to your bid based on the user meeting certain criteria, such as using 
a mobile device. A –100% modifier means that your bid will be 100 percent lower if 
the user meets that bid condition (in this case, that means the condition is the ad is 
displayed on a mobile device); therefore, if you use a –100% mobile bid modifier, then 
your ads will not be displayed on a mobile device (Figure 8.1).
Figure 8.1  –100% mobile bid modifier
If you are targeting only the Display Network, then you can also target mobile 
users based on the phone’s operating system or the carrier. It is common to see different 
carriers and operating systems have different demographics of users. Therefore, if you 
want to reach a wealthy audience, you might only target high-end carriers and iPhones 

Chapter 8:  Beyon d T ex t: Em ploy i ng I m age , V i deo, a n d Mobi le A ds  ■
260
or high-end Android phones. If you are trying to reach a demographic that makes less 
money, then targeting discount carriers is a good idea. In addition, if you are selling 
iPhone apps, you will want your ad shown only to iPhones. A local store using mobile 
ads to send searchers to driving direction pages should not filter ads by device or car-
rier and choose all carriers and all devices.
Technology Filters
Some technology is not supported on all devices. Google examines the technology used on your 
website to help determine what devices can support your website, and if a device does not support a 
technology you are using, then your ad may not show on that device. For instance, iPhones and iPads 
do not support Flash, so if you make liberal use of Flash on your website, then your ads most likely will 
not be shown to these devices that do not support Flash.
If you have desktop-based sites that utilize some of these filtered technologies and wish to show on all 
devices, then creating mobile-specific websites or landing pages using responsive design techniques 
can help you reach the most users regardless of the device being used to access your site. Responsive 
web design is a fairly recent web design approach that enables the website appearance to adjust 
based on the device on which it is being viewed.
Viewing Your Site’s Mobile Usage
You can view your site’s current mobile usage in some analytics systems. If you use Google Analytics, 
there are two ways to see your mobile usage. The first is to navigate to the segments and choose the 
Phone And Tablet option to segment all your data by non-desktop usage. The second option is to 
navigate to Audiences and then Mobile to see the amount of mobile traffic that your website has along 
with some basic metric differences, as shown here:

■  Beyon d t h e De sktop: Cr e at i ng Mobi le A ds
261
Smartphone Extensions
Many of the ad extensions discussed in Chapter 4, “Writing Compelling Ads,” can be 
used on smartphones. In addition, you can choose to create an extension so it is used 
on all devices or is smartphone preferred (Figure 8.2).
Figure 8.2  Mobile preference on call extensions
Usually the best extensions to make specifically for phones are the call, location, 
and sitelink extensions. This allows you to promote your business to mobile users dif-
ferently than to desktop users and control the message for each device.
An Easy Way to Create Mobile-Compatible Sites
If you want to test out mobile advertising but do not want to pay to have a full website developed, 
there is an easy way to create a small mobile site to test the traffic.
First, install WordPress, an open source content management system (CMS) that takes only a few min-
utes to set up on a server that supports PHP and MySQL.
WordPress supports a large variety of plug-ins that expand the functionality of the CMS. One of these 
is WordPress Mobile Edition. Information for the plug-in can be found at http://certified-
knowledge.org/blog/adwords-retiring-google-mobile-business-pages-quick-
mobile-site-creation-guide/. Install the plug-in.
Last, create your landing pages based on what you want a visitor to see, such as phone number or 
driving directions.
If you are technically minded, you can set up WordPress, install the plug-in, and create some new 
pages within an hour. And best of all, since it is open source, the entire system is free outside of your 
hosting fees.

Chapter 8:  Beyon d T ex t: Em ploy i ng I m age , V i deo, a n d Mobi le A ds  ■
262
Always think about the user experience. Is there a different reason someone 
would search for you on a desktop as compared to a mobile device? In most cases, the 
answer is yes. Therefore, you want to market to the user based on the action they are 
trying to conduct, which is often different by device.
While ad extensions can show on desktops or smartphones, older technologies 
power many phones where extensions and your regular text ads cannot be displayed. 
Instead, you need to use Google WAP ads, which have an entirely different creation 
process.
Reaching Other Mobile Users: WAP Mobile Ads
Many phones do not have full Internet browsers. These are often called feature phones. 
Feature phones can access the Internet, but they can view only pages that are designed 
to be rendered on a mobile device.
Because feature phones need specifically created pages, their users do not see the 
typical text ads on a Google search page. These users see only Google mobile ads on 
their search pages.
Google mobile ads are created at the ad group level. They are shown only if your 
keywords within that ad group are triggered. These ads follow all of your typical cam-
paign settings such as location or time-of-day targeting. To create a Google mobile ad, 
follow these steps:
	 1.	
Navigate to the ad group where you wish to create the ad.
	 2.	
Click the Ads tab.
	 3.	
Click New Ad.
	 4.	
Choose WAP Mobile Ad (Figure 8.3).
Figure 8.3  Choose WAP mobile ad to create a new mobile ad.
You should be presented with an ad-creation screen (Figure 8.4). Your new ad 
can be either text or an image. Since mobile screens are smaller than computer moni-
tors, so are the mobile ads.

■  Beyon d t h e De sktop: Cr e at i ng Mobi le A ds
263
Figure 8.4  Mobile ad-creation wizard
If you choose to create a text ad, your new ad will contain only two 18-char-
acter lines and a 20-character display URL. Mobile text ads must still meet all of the 
editorial requirements of typical ads, as discussed in Chapter 4.
Mobile image ads are smaller in size than normal image ads. If you select the 
WAP Image Ad radio button (as shown in Figure 8.4), you will be presented with an 
upload button and the image size requirements. Mobile image ads must meet image 
ad editorial requirements (discussed later in this chapter in the section “Technical and 
Editorial Requirements for Image Ads”).
Once you have created the ad, the next step is deciding what options you will 
present to a user who clicks on your ad. You have three options:
••
Send the user to your website.
••
Initiate a call to your phone number.
••
Give the user both choices.
If you want to send users to your website, your website must be mobile compat-
ible. You cannot send users who click on a WAP mobile ad to a typical HTML-coded 
website.
If you do not have a mobile-compatible site, or you want users to call you 
instead of visiting the site, you can choose only to allow visitors to call your business. 
This is often the best choice for locksmiths, towing companies, and other service-based 
businesses that prefer phone calls to website visits.
If you have a mobile website, you can give the user the choice of calling or click-
ing. In this case, the ad will be clickable and there will be a call feature next to the ad 
for someone to initiate a call to your company.

Chapter 8:  Beyon d T ex t: Em ploy i ng I m age , V i deo, a n d Mobi le A ds  ■
264
The last option is to have your ad show across all carriers or only specific car-
riers. For most companies, you will want to choose all carriers. However, if you are 
offering services that only certain types of phones can install, you might want to limit 
your ads to the carriers that support that phone.
Tracking Mobile Conversions
AdWords conversion tracking (covered in Chapter 13) works with text ads shown on smartphones but 
does not work with WAP mobile ads. To track conversions on your mobile site for smartphones, put 
your conversion tracking script on your mobile site’s thank-you pages. However, not all smartphones 
and their browsers support all scripts, so although conversion tracking is supported, the numbers will 
not be 100 percent accurate.
If you allow users to call you from your mobile ads, it is beneficial to use a phone number that is dif-
ferent from the one shown on your website and to work with a call-tracking provider so you can track 
how often you receive calls directly from the mobile ads and the quality of those phone calls.
Ad Preview and Diagnosis Tool
Often you will market to searchers who do not live in your own geography or are using 
technology (such as various phone types) that you do not own. When you want to see 
if your ads are running and approximately what they look like when displayed across 
various geographies and devices, the Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool will let you see 
what the ads look like under a variety of conditions.
You can access the Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool here:
https://adwords.google.com/d/AdPreview/
With this tool (Figure 8.5), you can preview ads based on the following 
characteristics:
••
The domain (useful for viewing other country information)
••
Language
••
Location
••
Desktop or laptop computer
••
Mobile devices
••
Tablet devices
When you choose mobile or tablet devices, you can also preview based on the 
operating system or carrier.

■  Beyon d t h e De sktop: Cr e at i ng Mobi le A ds
265
Figure 8.5  Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool options
Once you choose your options, then you will see the search results based on 
your chosen preview criteria. This is a very useful tool when you want to see ads from 
various areas or on various devices. In Chapter 13, we will discuss bidding, and one of 
the components we will cover is setting bids or segmenting campaigns based on geo-
graphic data. Often when creating these campaigns, you cannot see the ads in all of 
these regions, so by using the Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool, you can see your actual 
competition inside all of these various regions.
The total inventory for mobile ads is growing quickly. The number of searches 
on phones is smaller than what occurs on the desktop, but it is steadily increasing. 
However, sometimes the buy intent is often higher on a mobile device. You might com-
parison shop different locksmiths from a desktop computer, but if you are searching 
for a locksmith on a mobile device, you probably need a locksmith quickly.
In other cases, the buying intent is often lower on mobile devices. For instance, 
B2B companies often find that mobile phones and tablets are often used for research 
queries and not for contacting the company, and they spend a lot more time working 
on traditional desktop ads than mobile strategies.
Just because you can advertise on phones does not mean you should. You should 
examine your budgets, users, and conversion differences by device to determine if you 
should spend more time advertising on mobile devices, focus more on desktops, or split 
your time evenly.
While mobile text ads allow you to reach those not on a desktop, Google offers 
many ad types besides text ads to reach users who are still on their computers or are 
browsing the Web on their phones. In the next section, you will learn about additional 
ad types that will increase your company’s visibility across the Internet.

Beyond Static Text: Creating Rich Media Ads
AdWords supports different ad formats beyond text ads. The simplest of these are 
image ads. Image ads look like standard banner ads. The second ad format is known as 
rich media ads. Rich media ads are ad formats with which a user can interact, such as 
video ads.
These additional ad formats show up only on the Display Network (which will 
be discussed in depth in the following two chapters). Image and rich media ads are not 
shown on Google or search partners.
Image and rich media ads are typically paid for the same way you pay for text 
ads: using cost per click or cost per conversion bidding tactics. An additional feature 
of AdWords allows you to bid based on ad impressions you receive and not clicks. This 
is known as CPM bidding (cost per thousand impressions) and is available only for 
Display Network campaigns, which will be discussed in Chapter 9, “Understanding the 
Display Network.” Although the bidding methodology and setting bids are the exact 
same for these additional ad formats, it is not uncommon to see slightly higher prices 
for image ads due to the fact that you need to win the entire ad block for your ad to be 
shown.
Here are some of the benefits of using image and rich media ads:
••
Creating product awareness
••
Establishing higher brand recall value
••
Associating your brand with a product line
••
Introducing new products or services
••
Educating consumers on the product
••
Creating higher Display Network CTR
••
Increasing search CTR due to brand recognition
••
Increasing product awareness
••
Moving consumers into the buying funnel
Creating Effective Image Ads
Image ads serve two main purposes. The first use of image ads is to direct traffic to 
your website. These ads are measured in total clicks, conversions from those clicks, and 
cost per click.
The second reason to use image ads is to increase awareness of your products 
or services. These images should match other advertising efforts you are conducting, 
such as TV, print, or banner ads. Matching online and offline images can help increase 
your brand’s awareness by connecting the consumer’s awareness of your brand across 
channels.

■  Beyon d Stat ic T ex t: Cr e at i ng R ich M edi a A ds
267
Often the success of image ads is measured in brand lift, as measured by 
increased searches for your branded keywords or increased CTRs of your search ads. 
It is not uncommon to see your search CTR rise while your image or banner ads are 
being displayed across the Web as your brand becomes more recognizable and your site 
increases in authority.
There is a reason the old adage “A picture is worth a thousand words” has stood 
the test of time—it is true and can be applied to display ads. Text ads have very little 
recall. After a consumer sees your text ad, there is little chance they will remember 
the benefits the product promised. Image ads have much higher recall values. Often a 
consumer can recall the benefit of an ad that included images. If one of your advertis-
ing goals is not just to click but to increase your brand presence or align your company 
with a product, image ads are much more effective at accomplishing these goals.
The Tenets of Effective Image Ads
Follow these commandments when creating image ads:
Image ads should command attention.  Most banner-type ads can be camouflaged in the page. 
If your ad blends in with the rest of the page, it will be easy for users to ignore the 
image. Use visuals that stand out from the page and illustrate your point (Figure 8.6).
Figure 8.6  While this ad does many things correctly, the highlighted spine enhances this ad’s point of living pain free.
Image ads should be easy to comprehend.  Although image ads should contain some text that 
lets the reader know what you offer, if you have too much text in a small ad your main 
points will be lost. You should be able to glance at your image ad and know exactly 
what is being advertised without having to study it.
For example, in the ads shown here, the first ad (Figure 8.7) offers lower trading costs 
than the second ad (Figure 8.8). However, the text in Figure 8.7 makes it difficult to 
quickly comprehend all the information in the ad. Most users will not study your ads 
before clicking. The information should be clear and concise.

Chapter 8:  Beyon d T ex t: Em ploy i ng I m age , V i deo, a n d Mobi le A ds  ■
268
Figure 8.7  Ads that contain too much text are difficult  
to comprehend.
Figure 8.8  An ad that lacks a call to action
Image ads should clearly offer consumers a benefit.  Search ads are shown to individuals who are 
actively researching your market and are learning the features and benefits of different 
products and services. Image ads, also commonly called banner ads, are encountered 
by individuals as they browse websites on the Internet, not necessarily actively looking 
for anything in particular. Therefore, showing a clear benefit is essential. In addition, 
since these individuals may not even be in the buying funnel yet, offering free informa-
tion or a compelling reason to click is also essential (Figure 8.9). This approach can 
help you move someone who is unaware of your product into the buying funnel.
Figure 8.9  Offering free information can entice someone into the buying funnel.
Image ads should contain a call to action.  There is a difference between someone reading your 
ad and someone clicking on your ad. Without a clear call to action, a user will often 
read the ad and understand the information, but without further instructions will 

■  Beyon d Stat ic T ex t: Cr e at i ng R ich M edi a A ds
269
wander back to the content on the page. Make sure there is a clear call to action, such 
as a button that stands out from the rest of the ad. In addition, your callout buttons 
should contain benefits or call-to-action statements that go beyond just “click here.” 
See Figure 8.10.
Figure 8.10  Reclaim Your Time is an orange button  
that stands out from the mostly blue and silver ad.
For image ads that display across various networks you usually will need to use 
a more generalized offer, such as a free download, free trial, or compelling benefit for 
the user to visit your website. The biggest reason for these offers is that the user may 
not be in the buying funnel for your products, and you need to use the image ad to 
entice them into the buying funnel so you can eventually do business with them. If you 
are targeting specific websites and web pages, then you can you can also direct your ad 
messaging and offers differently to the consumer, tailored to the content of those spe-
cific pages.
If the user is on a website that indicates they have entered the buying funnel, you 
could show them an ad that does not offer a free or low-cost entry point to your ser-
vices but instead directs them further into the buying funnel (Figure 8.11).
Figure 8.11  If someone is on a site that contains LCD TV reviews,  
this ad brings them further into the buying funnel on your website.
If you know additional information about a user, utilize that information within 
your ads as well. This ad from Ford (Figure 8.12) shows the user’s location and how far 

Chapter 8:  Beyon d T ex t: Em ploy i ng I m age , V i deo, a n d Mobi le A ds  ■
270
a single gallon of gas will take them by incorporating a map program into the ad. This 
type of ad helps the user visualize exactly the benefit of buying this car.
Figure 8.12  A Ford ad that incorporates a map to illustrate a vehicle’s gas mileage
These same tenets of effective ads apply to both static and animated (such as 
Flash, animated GIF, and video) image ads. With dynamic image ads, the user may not 
watch the entire ad; therefore the opening and ending images should follow the exact 
same rules as static ads. However, while any additional animations are being displayed 
within the ad, feel free to be creative as long as you can keep the user’s attention. Do 
not let an image animate for too long (more than a few seconds) without showing a 
benefit to the user. Long-running animations might be fun for the graphics department 
to create, but a user’s attention will start to wane after a few seconds.
Technical and Editorial Requirements for Image Ads
Although these guidelines will help you make more effective image ads, there are cer-
tain standards your ad must meet before Google will approve your image ads:
••
Image ads must meet all of the standard editorial guidelines for text ads that 
were covered in Chapter 4, plus editorial and technical guidelines specific to 
image ads as discussed in this list.
••
Image ads can be in any of these formats:
••
JPG
••
JPEG
••
GIF (can also be used for animated ads)
••
SWF
••
PNG
••
Image and animated ads must be one of the standard Internet Advertising 
Bureau (IAB) sizes, with the exception of some regional specific sizes:

Note:  Google will add a small overlay to your image ad. This overlay will contain a line stating “ads by 
Google” or “AdChoices” that will link to more information about online advertising. Do not submit ads that have 
been resized for this overlay—those ads either will be rejected or will have additional whitespace in them.
While your ad must meet all of the editorial requirements for standard text ads, 
there are some additional requirements for image ads. Most of these requirements fol-
low the four tenets of landing pages:
Respect the user’s privacy.  For instance, you cannot use click tracking in Flash ads.
Do not be obnoxious.  An animated ad cannot expand beyond its frame. You cannot use 
strobing or Flash effects.
Do not trick the user.  You cannot mimic computer functions, computer error warnings, 
and the like.
All image ads must be family friendly.  Google does not allow adult image ads.

272
Image ads can effectively increase the recall rate of your brand, drive traffic to 
your website, and increase the search volume for your business. However, image ads 
contain a limited amount of information. If you wish to convey more information to 
Internet users or tell them a story about your products, video ads are a more effective 
communication tool.
Developing Profitable Video Ads
The massive increase in broadband penetration and Internet bandwidth around the 
world has given rise to an increase of video usage, from sites that contain user-gener-
ated videos such as YouTube to entire TV programs on Hulu.com.
The rise of video usage has not escaped marketers. Video allows you to both 
visually and audibly communicate a message to consumers. This increased interaction 
allows marketers to show how their products are used, utilize video testimonials, or 
create a more traditional message similar to a TV commercial. (An actual TV commer-
cial is rarely useful for video ads unless it is complementary to the TV commercial and 
you are creating a cross-medium message.)
Here are the three major ways to measure the effectiveness of your video ads:
••
The first is by examining how many people clicked on your video ad and then 
visited your website and conducted business with your company.
••
The second is similar to image ads, where you examine the increased searches 
and CTR of your search campaign on branded terms.
••
The third is a combination of the two, where you examine your play rates (the 
number of people who saw the video ad compared to the number who watched 
the video) and optimize your account to increase your play rate. Play rate is a 
useful metric if you are launching a new product or service that currently does 
not have search volume. The use of video can increase the awareness and ben-
efits of a service.
When you create video ads, you will have access to additional reports that 
include the following:
Play Rate  The percentage of people who play your video
Average Percent Played  The percentage of your video that is being watched
Cost per View  How much it costs you each time your video is watched
Frequency  How often users are being exposed to your ads
Reach  Estimated number of different individuals who have seen your ad
Click-Through Rate  The percentage of people who clicked on your ad
You can choose to pay according to CPV (cost per view), CPC, or CPM with 
video ads. CPV is probably the most popular option because you are charged only once 
a user watches at least 30 seconds of your video when the video autoplays or once the 

■  Beyon d Stat ic T ex t: Cr e at i ng R ich M edi a A ds
273
user decides to watch your video, which is common with video formats where a user 
must explicitly choose to watch your video (no autoplay). Video ads look very similar 
to image ads (Figure 8.13), with the exception that they each contain a play button and 
video bar at the bottom.
Figure 8.13  A perfect pairing of medium and subject
How to Create Videos That Are Actually Watched
These guidelines will help you get the most out of your video ads:
Utilize a compelling opening image.  AdWords video ads rarely autoplay, unless they are shown 
on YouTube. Most YouTube ads do autoplay, and some third-party publishers that spe-
cialize in video content also show autoplay ads. In many cases, a user has to click the 
play button to start playing the video. Therefore, the opening image (an image that you 
choose and upload along with your video ad) must be compelling so that someone will 
want to watch the video. Testing opening images (testing will be discussed in Chapter 
15, “Implementing Testing Techniques That Will Increase Profits”) together with using 
the guidelines for creating image ads can help increase your play rates.
With image ads, you want a commercial feel to them. With opening images for video 
ads, noncommercial images tend to increase play rates. Use a compelling image that is 
easy to comprehend and that contains a user benefit or call to action. Keep commercial 
items such as prices or shipping out of the image.
Keep videos to the point.  A video ad can be up to several minutes in length. However, after 
roughly 30 seconds, a user’s attention starts to decrease and you may see a lower per-
centage of your video being viewed. Try to keep your videos on the shorter side.
Utilize a strong call to action.  Since a user can stop watching your video at any time, make 
sure you have a strong call to action at multiple points within your video so that the 
viewer will want to click on the ad to visit your website. Do not have your only call to 
action at the end of the video. If you do, and no one finishes watching the video, your 
call to action will never be seen.
The video is a story, not an ad.  Videos that do well usually do not look like advertisements. 
These videos tell a story, educate the consumer, entertain the watcher, and give them a 

Chapter 8:  Beyon d T ex t: Em ploy i ng I m age , V i deo, a n d Mobi le A ds  ■
274
reason why they need to learn more about your business. Remember, the user can stop 
watching the video at any time. If your storyline is boring or appears to be a commer-
cial, you will see fewer visitors continuing to interact with your ads. Educate, inform, 
and entertain your viewers.
Video Ad Formats
There are a few types of video ad formats, and each one is slightly different in how it is 
used and paid for, so we will examine each one individually. Please keep in mind that 
a video ad format might not only be a video ad; it can refer to a banner run on top of 
a video ad, so the video ad formats refer to the AdWords ads that are used in, or as a 
companion to, online video.
In-Stream Video Ads  An in-stream video ad is a short, usually 15 or 20 seconds, autoplay 
video ad that appears before or within video content. These are very similar to tradi-
tional TV commercials where someone has to watch an ad before they can see the con-
tent of the site. With these ads, you are charged when the user watches the entire ad or 
thirty seconds, whichever occurs first.
In-Video Static Image Ads  These are banner ads that are overlaid on a video that a user is 
watching. A user can click the banner to watch another video or visit your website. 
With these ads, you are charged when a user clicks on your ad.
TrueView In-Display Video Ads  These are traditional video ads. These ads can be seen on 
YouTube or on third-party Display Network sites. With these videos, you can also cre-
ate a call-to-action overlay that looks much like a text ad, to help drive people from 
the ad to your destination URL. With these ads, you are charged when a user plays 
your ad.
TrueView In-Search Video Ads  These are ads that are displayed within YouTube search 
results. With these videos, you can also create a call-to-action overlay that looks like 
a text ad to drive people from your video to your website. With these ads you are 
charged when someone begins watching your video.
Hover-to-Play Engagement Ads  These are static images, and if a user hovers over the ad for 
two seconds or clicks on it, then a video is loaded and played. With these ads, you are 
charged when the video starts playing.
Lightbox Engagement Ads  These are video ads shown within a lightbox. A user can hover 
over or click on a small image and then see a large version of the ad overlaid on the 
screen. If the user watches your ad, then you will be charged.
Companion Banner Feature  With several of these ad formats, you can also upload a com-
panion banner that may show alongside the video. Not all publishers support compan-
ion banners. YouTube does support these banners, so we recommend that you upload a 
banner that can accompany your in-video images.

Video ads allow you to tell your company’s story to its viewers. They can show 
a viewer who is not in your buying funnel how your business can help them fill a need 
in their lives. As soon as a viewer thinks you can assist them with a need, they have 
entered the first steps of the buying funnel: awareness and interest.
The keys to effective AdWords video ads are the opening image that induces 
someone to watch the video and then the story itself.
Video ads are a challenge to create. They take time, money, and technical 
resources. If you want to create video or image ads but do not have the resources to 
start yet, Google offers tools that can help you get started in creating image and inter-
active ads within the AdWords interface.
AdWords Ad Gallery
There are two easy ways to create image and animated ads in the interface. The first 
one is a very basic ad that’s automatically created by scanning your landing pages and 
showing you examples.
To use the first creation tool, click the New Ad button from the Ads tab, and 
then choose Image Ad. On that screen, you will have the ability to create an ad. If you 
select it, Google will scan your landing page and website and give you several ad ideas 
(Figure 8.14).
Figure 8.14  Autocreated image ads

Chapter 8:  Beyon d T ex t: Em ploy i ng I m age , V i deo, a n d Mobi le A ds  ■
276
From this screen, you can change the text of the images, change your destination 
URL, or just save these images to an ad group. These are rarely better ads than a good 
designer could create. However, if you are looking for a quick way to create image ads 
for many different landing pages, these ads can get you started while you determine 
your top products and services that you want a designer to create for you.
The second way to create ads in the interface is to once again choose to cre-
ate a new ad from the Ads interface screen but choose Ad Gallery as the option 
(Figure 8.15).
Figure 8.15  Selecting the Ad Gallery tool
While there are several choices within the Ad Gallery tool, most users will want 
to start with General Purpose Ads. This is akin to the old Display Ad Builder tool, 
which allows you to quickly create image, rich media, and interactive ads. Google has 
designed a significant number of ad templates. All you need to do is fill in the tem-
plate’s blanks to customize those ads for your own business.
Once you’ve chosen to create a new ad, you can examine the various templates 
to find one that fits your needs (Figure 8.16).
Figure 8.16  Pick an ad template to customize.

■  A dWor ds A d Ga llery
277
One useful feature of the Ad Gallery tool is that you can build multiple ad sizes 
at once. Below the ad template image you will see the available sizes. You do not have 
to build a different ad for each size. If you build one ad, the same ad can then be saved 
as all the different image sizes. This is a huge timesaver when you are testing various 
formats and sizes.
After you have chosen an ad size, it is time to build the ad. Building the ad is a 
straightforward process (see Figure 8.17). Here’s all you need to do:
••
Fill in the text boxes.
••
Choose the colors of that text.
••
Choose the font for the text.
••
Upload images or logos where applicable.
••
Choose your background colors (if you wish to change them from the defaults).
••
Choose the display and destination URLs.
Figure 8.17  The Ad Gallery tool ad-creation screen
Before you save your image, preview the image in all the possible sizes. It is com-
mon for the Ad Gallery tool to build most of the sizes well, but usually you will see 
one or two sizes that just do not look correct. If you do not like how the tool built the 
image in certain sizes, uncheck those sizes so that you will not create ads that you do 
not like.

Chapter 8:  Beyon d T ex t: Em ploy i ng I m age , V i deo, a n d Mobi le A ds  ■
278
Depending on the amount of customization you add to an ad, it can take as little 
as five minutes to build an ad from scratch using this tool. It can be useful to first test 
different types of images, layouts, color schemes, and sizes before hiring a more expen-
sive designer to perfect your images. First, find out what works for your company, 
and then move to a more polished design step. Of course, you do not have to hire a 
designer; you can exclusively use these ad templates and still find advertising success.
Best Practices for Employing Image, Video, and Mobile Ads
Image and rich media ads allow you to target the Display Network in new and interest-
ing ways. These ads usually have response rates higher than you can receive from text 
ads. Mobile and Display Network users interact differently with ads than a desktop 
searcher; so ensure you follow these best practices to find advertising success with all 
your targeting methods.
••
When utilizing mobile ads, always consider whether the searcher has differ-
ent needs than when they are on a desktop so that you send the searcher to the 
proper place on your website.
••
Watch your mobile device usage statistics in Google Analytics to determine 
whether you need to create a mobile website for your current users.
••
Use mobile preferred ads and mobile preferred extensions to change the messag-
ing for mobile users versus desktop users.
••
If you want to reach users who do not have smartphones, which is very impor-
tant in developing nations, then use WAP mobile ads.
••
Use image ads to increase the recall of your brands and to increase the CTR of 
your display campaigns.
••
When using video ads, always test opening images to see which image increases 
play rate, CTR, and conversion rates.
••
Many video ad formats are charged on a CPV (cost per view) metric and not on 
a click basis.
Measure the changes to your branded search volume, search CTR, and con-
version rates when using rich media ads. Image and video ads can not only increase 
branded search volume, but they can also improve your search performance metrics. 
Image and video ads are shown only on the Display Network. The Display Network is 
significantly different from search. The next two chapters will dive into exactly what 
the Display Network is and how to effectively use the network to increase your adver-
tising reach with text, image, and/or video ads.

Understanding the 
Display Network
The Display Network is an often-­misunderstood 
aspect of Google AdWords. The Display Network 
will show your ads on non-search pages, such as 
news articles. Because search page views are a 
small percentage of the Web, using the Display 
Network can increase your advertising reach 
tremendously.
However, the Display Network uses differ-
ent rules to display your ads—users are in a dif-
ferent mind-set when reading articles compared 
to when they are searching. Therefore, under-
standing how the Display Network works and 
how to reach your prospects is essential to creat-
ing successful display campaigns.

What Is the Display Network?
When you think of Google, you naturally think of search. After all, it’s the premier 
search engine on the Web. If someone has to conduct a search before they can view 
your ad, then your ad is being displayed on Google search or Google search partners.
However, there are many times when someone does not have to conduct a search 
to see your ads. In these circumstances, your ads are displayed based on the content of 
the page or other targeting methods that will be discussed in this chapter.
If a person is reading an article on a newspaper site, would it not make sense 
to show ads based on what the article is about? Unrelated ads are easy to ignore, but 
when the ad is related to the article, it can help a consumer understand their choices or 
products and services related to that article.
For instance, I have a radio show called Marketing Nirvana, and I wrote an 
article about an episode that was all about call tracking (Figure 9.1). Within the article 
was an ad for Mongoose Metrics, a call-tracking solution.
Figure 9.1  Certified Knowledge article about call tracking
This is the type of match between advertiser and content that helps to drive new 
leads from the Display Network. The user who is reading an article about call tracking 
is likely to be interested in potential solutions.

Network Names: Content vs. Display
For years, the Display Network was called the content network. It makes sense—the ads are based on 
the page’s content. Google renamed this to the Google Display Network. The overall industry where 
ads are based on the content of the page is called contextual advertising. Regardless of the name, 
content network and Display Network mean the same thing within AdWords.
Advantages of the Display Network
A finite number of searches are conducted every month. That number continues to 
grow, but search page views are still a small percentage of all web activity. According 
to numerous studies by Pew Internet, Nielsen (www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2010/
what-americans-do-online-social-media-and-games-dominate-activity.html), and others, 
search page views make up approximately 3–5 percent of all page views on the Web. 
Other studies have stated that search page views make up approximately 3–5 percent 
of consumers’ time online. Most of these studies were conducted between 2009 and 
2012, and while there is no recent data on these overall activities, analysts do not feel 
these numbers have changed with respect to search.
If a page view is not a search result, it is a content page view. For instance, do 
you go directly to a news site every morning to read the news? If so, you could be 
making 20 or 30 content page views and no search page views. Those who go directly 
to Amazon to read product reviews often make 10 or 20 content page views and no 
searches. Do you use an app on your phone that shows ads? Display ads can be any 
non-search view, such as ads in a video or mobile app. Of course, there are those who 
combine searches and page views. However, when you want to expand your advertising 
efforts, there is no larger network than display advertising.
Google’s Display Network has a massive reach:
••
1 trillion monthly impressions
••
Over 2 million content partners
••
Reaches 94 percent of U.S. Internet users
••
Reaches 90 percent of global Internet users
Individuals who search for a product already have a need in mind. They are con-
ducting a search to find the answer to their need. These individuals are a small percent-
age of everyone online who could benefit by your product. Generally, these searchers 
are in the learning or later stages of the buying funnel (Figure 9.2), which is described 
in detail in Chapter 2, “Performing Keyword Research.”

Figure 9.2  The buying funnel
The buying funnel starts with awareness and interest. If people are unaware 
of your products or services, they do not know enough to search for them. Since the 
Display Network reaches those who may have a need for your product or service but 
who are unaware of your offerings, it can introduce many new prospects into the buy-
ing funnel.
Another advantage of utilizing Google’s Display Network is that you can use the 
alternate ad formats covered in Chapter 8, “Beyond Text: Employing Image, Video, 
and Mobile Ads.” Image and video ads are highly visual; combining rich media ads 
with the Display Network is a good technique for introducing your company to new 
prospects who otherwise are not aware of what you offer.
Display Targeting Methods
Your ads can be triggered across the Display Network in numerous ways. First, I will 
walk you through the more common ways in which your ad can be displayed and the 
jargon associated with the targeting types, and then we will get into how to build ad 
groups and campaigns based on these options.
Keyword Targeting  Advertisers can use keywords in display ad groups, and Google will 
attempt to show your ads when your keywords match the content on the page. This is 
often known as contextual targeting because your ads are being displayed based on the 
page’s content.
Topic Targeting  As Google crawls the Web, they classify the pages they find into various 
topics. Advertisers can choose to show your ad based on a topic. Since topics are more 
general than specific keywords, topic targeting often gathers more impressions than 
choosing some keywords. However, because topics are not as specific as keywords, 
the cost per action is often higher than for keywords. Since these ads are based on the 
page’s content, they are also known as contextual ads.
Interest Targeting  As users search and browse the Web, Google collects data about the 
type of content that interests the user. Users then get classified into various interest 
categories based on this data. Advertisers can target users based on these classified 
interests.

■  W h at Is t h e Displ ay N et wor k?
283
Interest targeting is much different than contextual targeting because you are showing 
ads based on the user’s behavior regardless of the page content.
Placement Targeting  Placement targeting allows an advertiser to target a specific site, 
page, or app or even ad slottage within a site. With this method, the advertiser actively 
picks the site where the ad is displayed.
Remarketing  Remarketing allows you to show ads to a user based on their prior behav-
ior on your website. This is a good method for showing ads to users who came to your 
website, showed an interest in your products or services, but did not convert. Because 
remarketing is an advanced form of display targeting, it will be covered in Chapter 10, 
“Utilizing Advanced Display Network Techniques.”
Flexible Targeting  Flexible targeting allows an advertiser to combine the various target-
ing methods before an ad is displayed. For instance, instead of using just placement 
targeting or just keywords, an advertiser can choose to show an ad based on both 
criteria; that is, the user is on the managed placement and the page’s article matches 
the advertiser’s keywords. Because this is an advanced targeting method, it will also be 
discussed in Chapter 10.
Demographic Targeting  Advertisers can also target users based on age and gender informa-
tion. Since these targeting options are rarely used by themselves but are mostly used 
as an additional filter when flexible reach is being utilized, these options will also be 
discussed in Chapter 10.
Other Campaign Settings  Over the course of this book, we cover many other campaign 
settings such as geography, budgets, and bid techniques. All of the other campaign set-
tings also apply across the Display Network.
Automatic vs. Managed Placements
When your ad is displayed on a site, in a mobile app, or in a video, regardless of the 
type of targeting you use, this is known as a placement. A placement could be as gen-
eral as the entire site or it could be as specific as an individual ad slot. For instance, you 
might see that your ad was shown on the New York Times, business section, bottom of 
page ad slot.
When you use keyword, topic, or interest targeting, you are choosing the 
method for displaying your ads, but you are not choosing the sites where the ads are 
being displayed. This is known as automatic placements. With automatic placements, 
the site is chosen for you based on your targeting method.
When you specifically choose a site or ad slot for your ad to be displayed, these 
placements are known as managed placements.
Beyond knowing the basics of the targeting methods and the jargon for place-
ment data, before you create a display campaign you should know how to isolate it 
from search.

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
284
Creating Search- and Display-Only Campaigns
With the search network, a user is actively looking for a solution to a problem. In many 
circles, this is also known as permission marketing. The user has given you permission 
to show them an ad based on their actions.
Across the Display Network, an advertiser is trying to pull focus from the user’s 
main interest, such as reading an article or watching a video, in order to receive the 
click on their ad. This is often called interruptive marketing because you are interrupt-
ing the user from their desired activity so that the user focuses on your ads.
Since these two methods of reaching users are quite different, you will often 
show different ads across the search network and Display Network. In addition, you 
will want to control bids and budgets separately for each network. Therefore, the first 
step is to make sure your ads are being shown only on the Display Network or on the 
search network.
When you create a new campaign, you have three options for search network 
and Display Network campaign types (Figure 9.3).
Figure 9.3  Selecting network options for new campaigns
••
Search Network Only: Your ads will be shown only on the search network.
••
Display Network Only: Your ads will be shown only on the Display Network.
••
Search Network With Display Select: Your ads will primarily be shown on 
search, but you will receive some display impressions.
Note:  You can also make these changes by using the AdWords Editor, which will be addressed in Chapter 12, 
“Saving Time and Scaling Accounts with the AdWords Editor.” In addition, if you have existing campaigns and want 
to change your account structure so that you have search-only and display-only campaigns, there is an easy way to 
accomplish this with the AdWords Editor.
Today, you no longer have the option to create campaigns that reach the entire 
search network and Display Network. However, many older accounts do have cam-
paigns that are set to both networks. If you navigate to the Settings tab for the account, 
you can view the settings for all your campaigns at once. If any of your campaigns 
have the Networks setting of All (Figure 9.4), then you will want to adjust those cam-
paigns’ Network settings.

■  W h at Is t h e Displ ay N et wor k?
285
Figure 9.4  Viewing your campaign settings
Once you make these changes, it can be useful to include the network type in 
your campaign name so you know which campaigns are shown on different networks 
(Figure 9.5).
Figure 9.5  Campaign names can  
help with organization.
Managing Ad Group Targeting
Choosing your targeting options is the same for each of the targeting methods. 
First, navigate to the Display Network tab, and click the button labeled + Targeting 
(Figure 9.6).
Figure 9.6  Navigating to the Display Network tab

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
286
If you are at the campaign level of data inside your account, Google will ask you 
to select an ad group. If you are currently in an ad group, then this step will be ignored 
and you will be changing the targeting for that ad group.
Next, choose the targeting type that you wish to employ (Figure 9.7).
Figure 9.7  Choose your targeting method.
You will then see a screen where you can manage that targeting type. For 
instance, if you select Display Keywords, then you can add and remove keywords. If 
you select Topics, then you can add and remove topics.
Some of the targeting methods have advanced options, such as Target And Bid 
and Bid Only. Since these options are mostly used for flexible reach, we will address 
them in Chapter 10 in the “Flexible Bidding Examples” section.
Once you have added or adjusted your targeting methods, then you can save the 
ad group and that ad group will use that targeting method.
There is no easy way to see which targeting method an ad group employs with-
out examining the Targeting settings. This is why it is useful to limit a campaign to a 
single targeting method and then label the campaign with the targeting method.
If you are going to have different targeting methods by ad group within the 
same campaign, for instance, one ad group is based on topics and another is based on 
keywords, it is useful to name the ad group based on that targeting method or employ 
labels and label each ad group.
Because the Display Network can be quite complex, especially with flexible 
reach, in this chapter we will focus on the basic ways in which ads can be displayed. In 
the next chapter, we will examine remarketing and how to combine the targeting types.
Creating a Successful Display Network Campaign
The first two methods of targeting we will address are contextual targeting methods: 
keywords and topics.

■  Cr e at i ng a Succe ssf u l Displ ay N et wor k Ca m pa ign
287
Google matches your display ads with pages using a three-step process when you 
use contextual targeting methods. Please note, this is a very simplified example to show 
how the overall process works:
	 1.	
Google scans a page within their Display Network, and they assign a topic to 
that page and determine the main words that are used on that page. At times 
they might scan only a section of a page, because items such as links or other ads 
do not always help determine the theme of a page.
	 2.	
Google examines the topics you have chosen for that ad group and makes note 
of your major keywords and the themes of those keywords.
	 3.	
When the Display Network page and your ad group contain the same keyword 
themes or topics, your ad can be displayed.
This is a simple look at how Google selects and places display ads; for organi-
zation and optimization purposes, there is no need to dive further into the nuances 
of this ad serving. Instead, I will show you some tools and tips to help refine your 
organization.
Use One Primary Targeting Method per Campaign
While you can have a campaign that utilizes one ad group for keywords, another for topics, and yet a 
third for interest targeting, I find that this lends itself to confusion as to how ads are being served and 
limits your overall campaign options. Therefore, it is useful to limit yourself to one targeting method 
per campaign. For instance, you might have one campaign that is only topics, another that is only 
interests, and yet a third that uses keywords. With this organization, if you find that keywords per-
form better than topics, you can easily adjust your budgets to have a higher daily budget for keywords 
and a lower daily budget for topics.
It is important to note that the Display Network obeys all of your campaign 
settings, such as location, time of day, and daily budget. Therefore, you can have your 
display ads shown only to a specific city or shown only at certain times of the day.
Creating Keyword-Based Display Ad Groups
Google examines the keywords within an ad group to try to establish the theme and 
top keywords of that ad group in order to show it on appropriate pages. There are a 
few rules when creating keyword-based display ad groups:
Use fewer than 50 keyword targets in an ad group.   Google will allow you to create a display ad 
group that has hundreds of positive and negative keywords in it. When you have this 
many targets within an ad group, your ad serving often suffers, and you might have 

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
288
keywords that never receive impressions or receive some very poor impressions due to 
too many targets.
It is useful to limit yourself to a maximum of 50 keywords, both positive and negative, 
per ad group. You should also consider your negative campaign keywords in this num-
ber. For instance, if you have 20 campaign negative keywords and 10 ad group negative 
keywords, then the ad group should have no more than 20 positive keywords.
For positive keywords, Google recommends 5–20, but I often find that 20 words are 
too many and can be confusing to Google’s matching technology. I try to limit myself 
to 12 words. It is even okay to have 1-word display ad groups.
The overall rules for search ad group organization also apply to display. Write an ad, 
pick a landing page, and then use a handful of words that are connectors between the 
ad and the landing page.
Use local jargon as keywords.  With contextual targeting you are matching keywords from 
your ad group to ones used on the page. Different journalists, websites, and countries 
use different words to describe the same product. For instance, do you call it a cell 
phone or a mobile phone? The word cell phone is widely used in the United States in 
both consumer jargon and on website reviews about phones, and the word mobile 
phone is rarely used. Conversely, in the UK, you will see articles that use the word 
mobile phone much more often than cell phone. Therefore, if you are marketing a new 
phone around the world, you would want to use both of these keywords.
Match types do not matter.  Google does not give more weight to exact match keywords 
over broad match keywords in determining your ad group’s theme. Match types are 
ignored. Therefore, if you have a keyword with all three match types in a display cam-
paign, you are just wasting your time. Ignore match types.
Google takes negative keywords into account.  While Google ignores whether a keyword is a 
broad, phrase, or exact match, they do take into account negative keywords when try-
ing to determine your theme. If there are words that when used in an article signal to 
you that the article is not being read by your desired audience, you should add them as 
negative keywords.
For example, let’s assume you are marketing an iPhone application. You regularly 
check the pages that are sending you traffic but are not converting. Over time, you find 
a pattern that when the words jailbreak and jailbreaking appear on the page, the traf-
fic does not convert. Since jailbreaking an iPhone is a method of unlocking the iPhone 
that makes the phone incompatible with other features, it turns out these “jailbroken” 
iPhones can’t take advantage of your app; therefore, these clicks do not convert. In this 
case, you would then add jailbreak and jailbreaking as negative keywords in the ad 
group so your ads no longer show up on those pages.

■  Cr e at i ng a Succe ssf u l Displ ay N et wor k Ca m pa ign
289
The overall idea of creating granular keyword-based ad groups is the same for 
search as it is for display. The major difference is that with search, there are set rules 
based on your match types and the search query that determines if your ad will be 
displayed. With the Display Network, your keywords are suggestions, and since match 
types are ignored, you have less control over determining if an ad will be displayed.
Now that you know the overall rules for creating keyword-based display ad 
groups, let’s examine some tools to help you find keywords.
Display Keyword Research
There are two methods, besides just using your brain to think about your keywords, 
that you can use to find display-based keywords. The first is a tool from Google known 
as the Display Planner, and the second is a method based on examining data from 
potential placement targets.
Display Planner Tool
Google has a tool that will suggest potential keywords, topics, and other display tar-
gets: the Display Planner. This tool is similar to Google’s Keyword Planner (discussed 
in Chapter 3, “Keyword Tools: Extracting Valuable Data from Google”) except it is 
meant to find data to use across the Display Network, whereas the Keyword Planner 
tool is useful for finding targets across the search network. To access this tool, click the 
Tools and Analysis button in the account, and then select Display Planner (Figure 9.8).
Figure 9.8  Accessing the Display Planner
Within the tool, you can search for keyword, category, or site data to receive 
information. In addition, you can use your website’s landing page as well as a few other 
options in finding data. Once you conduct a search, you can then see a list of potential 
display ad groups (Figure 9.9) along with information about the total inventory, such as 
age, gender, and device.

Figure 9.9  Display Planner results for plasma TVs
From these results, you can click an ad group and see detailed stats about the 
keywords in that ad group (Figure 9.10).
Figure 9.10  Suggested display keywords for Plasma TV ad group

291
From within the tool, you can add ad groups or keywords to your account just 
as with the Keyword Planner tool. The tool makes it easy to find keywords and ad 
group ideas for the Display Network. This tool is also useful for each of the other tar-
geting methods we will discuss. Therefore, we will show a few snippets of the tool in 
each appropriate section, and then we’ll cover the entire tool in depth in the section 
“Using the Display Planner Tool,” later in this chapter.
Keyword Density Analysis
Another way to try to find the correct words to use in an ad group is to use a keyword 
density analyzer program like Textanz, shown in Figure 9.11.
Figure 9.11  Textanz keyword density analyzer by Cro-Code
Note:  A keyword density analyzer is a program that examines a page, or set of pages, and tells you the fre-
quency at which words and phrases appear on the pages.
When using a keyword density analyzer, there are a few rules to keep in mind:
Choose the types of pages where you want your ad to be shown.  If you want your ads to be shown 
on review sites, examine the density of the review page. Different words are used in 
describing a product review versus an editorial page versus a news article. By using 
words in your ad group that show up on these pages, your ad is more likely to be 
placed correctly.
Analyze several pages and combine the data before choosing your keywords.  Authors vary in writing 
styles. Different types of sites have different editorial guidelines. If you were to analyze 
only a single page, your results would be skewed and your placements could suffer. 
Choose several different pages across multiple websites when you are analyzing the top 
keywords.
Examine your best placements.  Later in this chapter, we will examine how to find your best 
placements. You can use those placements as a starting place for examining what key-
words are being used on those sites or individual pages.

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
292
Always use common sense.  When you use a density analyzer, you will find instances of com-
mon words (you, submit, can, have, among others) and ad copy from poorly targeted 
text ads that do not describe your services or goods. Just because a word has a high fre-
quency of occurrence does not mean it is a good word to use in your ad group. Always 
use common sense in choosing words to create a cohesive theme.
Once you have a list of the most common words used on your top pages, you 
can then organize those words into display ad groups using the same rules that we have 
discussed: Pick an ad and landing page, and then use keywords in that ad group that 
serve as good connecting points for the ad and landing page.
When using keyword targeting across the Display Network, you must think 
a lot about your ad groups and their overall organization. However, if you just want 
to quickly reach many users, you do not have to go to that level of detail; instead you 
could use topic targeting.
Display Network Topic Targeting
As Google crawls the Web, they assign each page or site they find into one or more 
topics of their preset list of topics. As an advertiser, you can choose to have your 
ads displayed based on a user being on a page that matches one of the topics you are 
targeting.
When examining our clients, we find that topic targeting often leads to more 
impressions than our keywords. With keywords, Google is trying to match the page’s 
content to your keywords, so if you are missing some keywords in a topic, which is 
pretty easy to do, then your ad will not be displayed if you are using keyword target-
ing. Since topics can cover a large range of keywords, topic targeting usually brings in 
more total impressions.
However, we also find that, in general, our cost per action and conversion rates 
are lower for topic targeting than for our keywords. With keywords, you are explicitly 
choosing when you want your ad to show, and since hopefully you have well-chosen 
keywords, most of your traffic should be highly qualified. Since topic targeting covers 
a wide range of keywords, some being good for you and others not as good, you often 
end up with some traffic that is not relevant to your products and services.
This is the great balance across the Display Network: reach or CPA? If you want 
a large reach, then topic targeting is fantastic. If you want a low CPA by driving only 
quality traffic to your site, then keywords are great to use. What is more important to 
you: a few conversions at a great CPA or more total conversions at a higher CPA?
You can also use both keywords and topics. One campaign or ad group can 
employ keywords and another one can employ topics. Then you can set your bids or 
budgets (if you have separated the targeting types by campaign) based on how each tar-
geting type is performing.

293
When choosing your topic targeting options, you can either drill down through 
the results (Figure 9.12) or conduct a search and see matching topic options.
Figure 9.12  Topic targeting categories
A topic can fall into a top-level category, a subcategory, or multiple subs of a cat-
egory. When you choose the top-level category, you ad can show for any subcategories 
as well.
For instance, the topic plasma TVs is under these categories:
••
Consumer Electronics
••
TV & Video Equipment
••
Televisions
••
Plasma TVs
If you were to choose the Consumer Electronics category, then your ad could 
show for items ranging from plasma TVs to game consoles to GPS devices.
If you were to choose TV & Video Equipment, then your ad could show for 
items ranging from home theater systems to projection TVs to DVD players.
If you were to choose Televisions, then your ad could show for a variety of TV 
types, such as plasma, LCD, and so on.
If you were to choose Plasma TV, then you ad should show up only on pages 
that mention plasma TVs.
Let’s say that you are a very large electronics company and that you want to 
advertise across the Display Network for all consumer electronics. You would not want 
to add just the Consumer Electronics category and be done with your display advertis-
ing. In that case, you would use the same ad and landing page for every one of those 
potential topics.

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
294
Instead, you would create one ad group for consumer electronics, another ad 
group for televisions, and yet another for plasma TVs and continue to add every single 
topic as its own ad group. When you create all of these ad groups, you can then test ads 
by category and ensure that your landing page is the most specific page on your site for 
that topic.
With topics, since these categories can reach a large variety of keywords, it is 
best to limit yourself to one topic per ad group.
Researching and Finding Topics
When you add topics, you can search and drill down through the preset category lists 
to find topics. In addition, you can see a lot of information about potential topics with 
the Display Planner tool.
If you search for a general keyword, in this case TV (Figure 9.13), the Display 
Planner tool will show you a list of potential ad groups along with some data about the 
reach of those topics.
Figure 9.13  Display Planner topic overview

■  Cr e at i ng a Succe ssf u l Displ ay N et wor k Ca m pa ign
295
If you drill down into one of those ad groups, you can see more detailed infor-
mation on all of the topics (Figure 9.14).
Figure 9.14  Detailed topic information from the Display Planner
In the Topic column of Figure 9.14, the very last word or phrase of the topic 
drilldown is a hyperlink. If you click that hyperlink, then you can see detailed stats 
about that specific topic (Figure 9.15).
As with the Keyword Planner tool, when you find topics that you want to adver-
tise on, add them to your plan, and you can then save them to your campaign.

Targeting Ads Based on a User’s Interest
As users search, use various Google products, and surf the Web, a treasure trove of 
data is collected about these users. One of the data points that is created is the type of 
information and products that each user has shown interest in.
As a marketer, you can target a user based on this interest regardless of the page 
they are currently on. This type of targeting is not contextual because the ad is shown 
based not on the page’s content but on the user’s interest. This is often known as 
behavioral targeting since you are showing ads based on a user’s behavior.
Just to be clear, you could target a user based on the fact they have shown an 
interest in traveling. If that user is on a site that is about AdWords because they want 
to learn more about advertising online, they can still see your travel ad because you are 
targeting the user and not the site’s content.
If you are curious as to what interest categories you have been classified into, 
you can visit the page https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads and view, adjust, or 
opt out of the settings used to target you.
Interest categories fall into five types of subcategories (Figure 9.16). Two of 
them, remarking and custom combinations, will be addressed in Chapter 10.
Other Categories  Other categories, often listed as interest categories depending on your 
country, are the full list of available categories based on a user’s interests. The three 
interest-level categories do not exist in each country, so for countries that do not have 
affinity categories or in-market buyers, this might be the only category listed.

■  Cr e at i ng a Succe ssf u l Displ ay N et wor k Ca m pa ign
297
Figure 9.16  Three of the top-level interest categories
With these categories, you can be very specific as to the type of interest you want to 
target. This category type has the second-largest reach of all the interest categories. 
Often this category type is used when the more specific options are not available for a 
country or if your target user does not exist in one of the other targeting methods.
Affinity Categories  Affinity categories attempt to bridge the gap between the reach of TV 
advertising and the data-driven approach of web-based advertising. These categories 
are derived by user behavior as much as by their interests and are broader than the 
“other” categories. For instance, there is the category luxury shoppers. A luxury shop-
per is one who buys high-end items, such as expensive jewelry, a lake house, or the best 
in home entertainment.
If your goal is an increase in the reach and awareness of your offers and not just direct 
sales, these are good lists to use. If your goal is just direct sales, these lists are usually 
too broad to lead to great results.
In-Market Buyers  Google attempts to determine if a user is currently shopping for a 
specific item, such as a car, new computer, or refrigerator, and then puts them in an 
in-market buyer list. This list should be made up of users who are currently in the con-
sideration phase of a product.
At the moment, there are not very many total list options, and most of the options are 
for items with long consideration phases, such as a new house. If your goal is to drive 
sales from your interest targeting, even if the reach is not that large, this is a good list 
type to try.
The in-market buyers list options are currently available only to English targeted ads.
In my experience, I find that affinity categories are good at driving impressions 
and awareness but rarely drive many direct sales. There are times when your goals are 
to ensure everyone knows about your product so that when they are in the market for 
your product, your company is top of mind. This is a good way to increase that type of 
reach.

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
298
As for in-market buyers, my experience has been up and down. I have had a few 
occasions when it did work quite well, especially with automotive ads that had a goal 
of getting people to test drive a car. However, I have also had some very poor experi-
ence with this segmentation type.
I find that the other interest-based ads, which is the only option in some coun-
tries and languages, generally perform better than topic targeting but worse than key-
word targeting, for purchases that happen on a regular basis.
For instance, if a family has an infant, they purchase diapers at least once per 
month. Because this is a common repeat behavior, showing interest ads to those in the 
Baby Care & Hygiene and Baby Food & Formula interest groups usually performs well 
since a user repeats this purchase often.
Unless you are a very lucky person, you probably do not go on a cruise vacation 
every month. Buying a ticket for a cruise is usually a yearly event at the most and might 
be a onetime event for many individuals.
Therefore, I find that showing interest ads to those in the Cruises & Charters inter-
est groups is met with very mixed results. In some cases, these interest groups do okay at 
best (but usually worse than topic and keyword targeting) and sometimes do quite poorly.
In this instance, see if an in-market list exists for you to try. At the moment, 
travel is not part of the in-market list options, but Google is constantly expanding their 
lists, so that option might be available someday.
If you are trying to reach repeat buyers, then the other interest targeting is worth 
trying. If your goal is only direct sales, then stick to in-market buyers or other display 
targeting options.
As with the keyword and topic targeting options, you can use the Display 
Planner to search for interest ideas and see the same stats for interest ideas as you can 
for the other targeting types.
Placement Targeting: Choose the Actual Sites Where Your Ads Are Displayed
With interest, topic, and keyword targeting, Google places your ads on a variety of 
sites based on the user or site being in your targeting criteria. These are known as auto-
matic placements. However, what you do not get to select with automatic placements 
is the actual website where your ad will be displayed. With placement targeting, you 
can select the actual website and even ad slot where your ad is displayed. This targeting 
method is also known as managed placements since you are actively choosing which 
sites you want to display your ads.
This targeting option is called placement targeting and not website targeting for 
a reason. Many websites have multiple ad slots on them. So instead of trying to adver-
tise on the entire site, in many cases you can advertise on just a small section of a site 
or even in a specific ad slot. For example, the New York Times has a large variety of 
placements (Figure 9.17), and you can designate your ad to be on the theater pages, the 
homepage, the finance pages, and many more other categories within that website.

Researching Placements
There are three ways of finding placements to target. The first is to examine your cur-
rent placement data based on your other targeting options, such as keywords or topics. 
To see this data, navigate to the Display Network tab and click the Placements button. 
From that screen you will see a list of all your placement data (Figure 9.18).
Figure 9.18  Placement data

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
300
In the Status column, you usually see one of three statuses:
••
Automatic: These placements are ones where Google showed your ads based on 
other targeting settings.
••
Managed: These placements are sites you added as managed placements.
••
Paused/deleted: If the campaign or ad group is paused or has been deleted, you 
will see a paused or deleted notice.
If you want to see more details about the specific placements, you can click next 
to the placement or select them all, click See Details (Figure 9.19), and choose to see 
more in-depth data about the placements.
Figure 9.19  View placement details
When you view the details (Figure 9.20), you can see the actual URLs where 
your ads have been displayed along with detailed metrics, such as cost-per-conversion 
data if you have conversion tracking enabled.
From this screen, you can then exclude a placement, meaning your ad will no 
longer be shown on that placement, or add the URL as a new managed placement. To 
do so, select the URL that you want to exclude or manage and then click the Exclude 
Placements button to exclude the placement or click the Manage Placement And Bid 
button to add the URL as a new placement (Figure 9.21).
When you add a placement, in the details screen you will see the Added annota-
tion. If you exclude the placement, then you will see the Excluded annotation next to 
the URL.
If you see automatic placements that are regularly sending you traffic that meets 
your goals, then adding those URLs as managed placements is a good idea so that your 
ad is always eligible to show on those websites.

301
Figure 9.20  URL details for your placements
Figure 9.21  Managing or excluding placements
The second method of finding placements is to navigate to the ad group’s Display 
Network ad targeting screen, select placements, and then search for various placements 
(Figure 9.22).

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
302
Figure 9.22  Searching for placements in the display targeting options
While this method is very simple, it is often the worst way to add placements 
unless you know exactly what sites you want to add. The reason is that the search fea-
ture rarely shows all the placements available for a website, and in some cases it does 
not show available sites. For instance, in Figure 9.23, the search was for nytimes.com, 
a site that is available to target through the Display Network, and yet that site is not 
shown in the search results.
Usually the best tool to use in researching placements is the Display Planner. You 
can navigate to the Display Planner from the Tools menu, enter your criteria for search, 
and then click the button Get Placement Ideas to see available placements (Figure 9.23).
Figure 9.23  Get placement ideas from the Display Planner.

■  Cr e at i ng a Succe ssf u l Displ ay N et wor k Ca m pa ign
303
This will take you to a screen that shows you available placements (Figure 9.24) 
and data about those placements.
Figure 9.24  Detailed placement data in the Display Planner
If you see the notation underneath a URL “+ Show Similar Placements,” as 
shown in Figure 9.24, you can click the plus icon to see additional placements available 
on the same website.
If you click the website link, you will see detailed data about the site, including 
the type of ad formats supported (Figure 9.25).
As you see websites where you wish to show your ads, you can add them to the 
keyword plan and then save them to your ad group. Once you add placements to your 
ad group, you can set the bids on those placements just like you would with keywords. 
The main difference between display and search campaigns is the targeting; the man-
agement of bids if you are using a single targeting method is the same.
Organizing Placements
When you are creating search keyword ad groups, the ads should be closely related to 
the keywords. Granular ad groups usually lead to higher click-through and conversion 
rates.
The same organization can be applied to placement ad groups. Examine the 
placements where your ads will be shown to create themes for these placements. Then 
group these different themes into ad groups.

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
304
Figure 9.25  Detailed placement data for newser.com
This organization will make your ads more relevant when they appear on place-
ment targeted sites, which should increase both click-through and conversion rates. For 
instance, if you sold wedding supplies you could start with ad groups such as these:
••
Wedding dresses
••
Wedding cakes
••
Wedding favors
••
Wedding flowers
••
Wedding pictures
With this organization, you no longer have to write generic ad copy about how 
your company handles everything related to weddings. You can now tailor your ads 
to each type of website where your ads will be shown. This strategy will create higher 
relevancy between your ad, placement, and landing page, which will in turn make your 
marketing more effective.
By taking this extra step in organizing your placement campaigns, you will 
find it easier to see not only what sites are converting for you but which ad groups (or 
themes) are bringing in revenue.

Blocking Your Ads from Being Shown across the Display Network
The methods discussed so far in this chapter have been around ways in which you can 
enable your ads to be shown across the entire Display Network. However, there will be 
places on the Internet where you do not want to show your ads. The reasons can range 
from underperforming websites to R-rated videos that are not brand appropriate for 
your ads. The good news is that AdWords gives you the ability to exclude certain types 
of online properties from ever showing your ads.
There are two ways to navigate to the area where you can select what to block. 
From the Display Network tab, you can scroll down to the bottom of the screen to 
where you see the +Exclusions and +Options buttons (Figure 9.26), or you can navigate 
to the Ad Group Targeting And Exclusions screen shown  in Figure 9.27.
Figure 9.26  Blocking your ads from unwanted sites
Each of these methods takes you to the exclusion features area; the difference is 
which exclusion is open by default. However, you can navigate to any of the exclusions 
from this screen (Figure 9.27).
All of the exclusions except for site category options can be applied at the ad 
group or campaign level. The site category options apply only to the campaign level. If 
you exclude a targeting method at the campaign level, it will apply to all the ad groups 
within that campaign. If you exclude an option at the ad group level, the exclusion will 
apply only to that ad group.

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
306
Figure 9.27  Ad group and campaign exclusions
You have several options for excluding your ads from being displayed:
Display Keywords  With display keywords, you can exclude your ads from showing when 
a page contains a specific keyword. The way negative keywords are used for display 
is different than for search. Across the Display Network, these negative keywords are 
suggestions as to what pages you do not want your ad to appear on. It is possible that 
your ad will appear on a page that contains that keyword. As with Display Network 
keywords, do not worry about match types. Since you do not want an ad group to have 
more than 50 total keyword targets, we will examine later in this chapter how to deter-
mine negative keywords for the Display Network.
Placements  The placements exclusion allows you to keep your ad from showing on 
specific placements. If you find sites that do not perform or that you do not want your 
ads to appear on for other reasons, such as the overall content of the site, then you can 
block your ad from showing on that site by using the placements exclusion option.
You do not have to exclude an entire site; you can choose to exclude only a single page, 
a subdomain, or a folder of a site. For instance, if you exclude sample.example.com, 
then your ads will not run on the subdomain sample.example.com, but your ads can 
show on example.com. If you exclude the folder example.com/stuff, then your ads will 
not show in the /stuff directory, but they could show on other pages of that domain.
There is also a placement list option that is the same as the negative keyword list 
option. You can create a list of placements and then share that list to other campaigns 

■  Block i ng You r A ds from Bei ng Show n across t h e Displ ay N et wor k
307
using the Shared Libraries feature. Whenever you add a placement to a placement list, 
each campaign that also shares that list will then block that placement.
Topics  If you do not want your ad to show for certain topics, then you can add those 
topics as negative topics, and if a page is classified into that topic, then your ad should 
not show on that page.
For instance, in several examples throughout this book I have used the word bleach 
because it can mean both a cleaning supply and a Japanese anime show. If you were 
marketing cleaning supplies, then you would want to add the negative topic Arts & 
Entertainment or Comics & Animation to keep your ad from showing on sites about 
anime.
Interests & Remarketing  We will discuss remarketing in depth in Chapter 10, so we will 
skip that option for the moment. However, if there are interest categories that you do 
not wish to show for, you can block them as well.
A good example would be if you were selling expensive jewelry. You might create an ad 
group that utilizes the interest targeting affinity group Luxury Buyers. However, if you 
sold only jewelry, you might exclude those who also show an interest in other luxury 
goods, such as cars. Please note that a person could be in both groups, so if you did 
block the Luxury Car category and a user was in both the Luxury affinity group and 
the Luxury Car category, they would not see your ad. Whenever you add additional 
negatives, you will want to wait a week to a month and then compare your current 
metrics to your old ones (before you blocked that category) to see how the change 
affected your total conversions and your CPAs.
Gender and Age  You can block users based on their gender or age. This blocking occurs 
only if Google is confident in the user’s demographic information. Since many users are 
classified as Unknown for gender and age, you will lose a lot of traffic if you exclude 
the Unknown classification. It is probably best not to block the Unknowns unless you 
have a small budget and want to reach only a very specific age or gender group.
Site Category Options  The site category exclusions can be specified only at the campaign 
level and are a catchall category comprising several options (Figure 9.28) including sen-
sitive content, the types of placements, video content, ad location, and mobile apps.
If you have someone in your company who is in charge of brand management, then 
you should discuss these options with them because these can protect you from some 
embarrassing situations. Every once in a while you will see an article about a devastat-
ing plane crash and next to the article is an ad for new luggage or cheap airfares. These 
are usually poor placements that you will want to block. However, do not blindly block 
all of these categories. If you sell surplus military gear, you will want to be on pages 
that discuss military and international conflict.

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
308
Figure 9.28  Site category exclusion options
One of the current issues is that you can no longer see your stats by category within 
AdWords to determine whether you should block a category. For instance, Figure 9.29 
shows the stats by category in the old interface for a site that sold software.
The conversion rates for this company’s sales for their account were roughly 10 per-
cent. The software had nothing to do with crime, conflict, or sexually suggestive 
content, yet those categories converted higher than their search marketing. With the 
current lack of data about each category, you should block them based on protecting 
your brand and not necessarily because you do not think the categories will convert.

309
Figure 9.29  Stats by category exclusion options
Determining Negative Display Keywords
While most of these blocking options are straightforward, the one option that often 
needs additional analysis before employing is negative keywords. Since negative key-
words are suggestions about placements and not absolutes, and you do not want too 
many negative keywords because that can adversely affect your display ad serving, 
there is a way to determine your negative keywords.
The first step is to look at your placement data and find your top 10 to 20 place-
ment URLs in terms of both CPA and absolute conversions and then take a look at 
your worst 10 to 20 placements. Please note, if you are tech savvy, you can use many 
more pages than 10 to 20.
Run those pages through a keyword density analyzer to find what words are 
common to the top sites and the worst sites. You can even make this analysis to exam-
ine the frequency of those words on your top and worst placements.
For instance, in this analysis (Figure 9.30) the company’s CPA goal is $50. They 
are okay if the CPA is between $51 and $99, but it is not ideal. Finally, they do not 
want to pay to be on any sites where the CPA is above $100.

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
310
Figure 9.30  Keyword frequency for top and worst placements
Therefore, for the nine most commonly used words on pages where their ads 
were being shown, we examined how often a placement included that word at least 
once when the CPA was under $50 or over $100. In this case, the word software 
appeared on 94 placements. One of those placements had a CPA of under $50 and 
93 of them had a CPA of over $100. This tells us that the word software would be a 
good negative keyword.
In the same example, the word gates appeared on 110 sites when the CPA was 
under $50 and 97 times when the CPA was over $100. While this word frequently 
appears on sites with high CPAs, it also appears often on sites with low CPAs and thus 
should not be a negative keyword.
Although this type of analysis can be a lot of work, it can also help ensure that 
you are adding only the appropriate display negative keywords.
Smart Pricing: Measure Success with Cost per Conversion
We will cover bidding in detail throughout Chapter 13, “Devising Profitable Bid 
Strategies.” However, because search and display have slightly different metrics and 
because of the ways that click costs are calculated, we need to address some of the suc-
cess metrics with the Display Network here before you read all of the ways to calculate 
bids in Chapter 13.
In search, Google uses a feature called the AdWords Discounter so that you 
pay only a penny more than necessary to appear just above the ad that is below yours. 
Google uses a different set of pricing rules, called smart pricing, for the Display 
Network.
With smart pricing, Google looks to see if a page is more or less likely to end in 
a conversion action. If a page is less likely to end with a conversion, Google may dis-
count the price of that click. If a click is more likely to turn into a conversion, they may 
charge more for that click (up to your maximum CPC).

■  Sm a rt Pr ici ng: M e asu r e Succe ss w i t h Cost per Con v ersion
311
Note:  While Google may discount your click prices for the Display Network, you should set different bids for 
the Display Network based on the return of ad spend or what it will cost to reach your marketing goals. You may 
have ad groups where you are willing to bid more per click than on search. Conversely, you will have ad groups 
where you are willing to bid less than on search. Do not use the same bid for both networks. If in doubt, using a 
display bid of 75 percent of your search bid will get you started. For example, if you were willing to pay $1 for a click 
on search, set your display bid at $0.75.
The smart pricing feature creates a scenario where your conversion rates are not 
nearly as important as your cost per conversion for the Display Network.
Let’s assume for a moment that you sell digital cameras and that your maximum 
CPC is set to $1. The first site where your ad is shown is an authoritative review site 
where your ad is shown alongside an article that reviews the digital camera you are 
selling. This type of site is far along in the shopping cycle and the traffic is more likely 
to convert on your website than traffic from other display sites; therefore, you are also 
going to pay a higher CPC than a less-authoritative website. Let’s also say that your ad 
was shown on Johnny’s blog alongside a story where he talks about how he used his

fore less likely to convert for your products. However, that does not mean you do not 
want your ad to show on Johnny’s blog. The numbers should tell you the story of your 
ad’s effectiveness on each of these two sites (see Table 9.1).

In this scenario, Johnny’s blog has half the conversion rate of the review site (5 
percent vs. 10 percent). However, because you are paying significantly less per click 
($0.25 vs. $1), Johnny’s blog has a better cost per conversion ($5 vs. $10). You make 
more profit from a visitor to Johnny’s blog than from a visitor to the review site.
Each site has different types of users and will therefore send different types of 
traffic. You may see large differences in CPC and conversion rate for each website 
where your ad is shown. However, conversion rates and CPC are not nearly as impor-
tant as cost per conversion when examining success for the Display Network.

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■

Once your ads have some exposure across the Display Network, you should 
examine the websites where your ad is being shown to determine where you are receiv-
ing both good and bad returns.
After your ads have run for a while and accrued enough data for you to make 
sound decisions, it is time to run AdWords reports and fine-tune your display cam-
paigns based on success metrics.
Choosing CPM or CPC Bidding
With the Display Network, placements, or keywords, there are several ways you can 
choose to pay for your ads. The typical method is cost per click or CPA bidding (dis-
cussed in Chapter 13). However, if your ad is shown only on the Display Network, you 
can choose to pay per impression instead of by click.
Cost per thousand impressions (CPM) is the way most banner ads are purchased 
on the Web. With CPM bidding, you are informing Google how much you want to pay 
for a thousand impressions. As with CPC bidding, you could pay less than your bid 
amount, but you will not pay more.
With CPM bidding, your goal is not just traffic to your website—your goal is 
also to increase the recognition of your brand, products, and services. It is not uncom-
mon to see a company buy banner ads and then see an increase in search volume for 
their company’s name or products.
Since you are paying for an impression, you need to make sure each impression 
is worth your marketing dollars. Therefore, always use a rich media ad, such as an 
image or video ad, when bidding CPM. Text ads have little recall value, and bidding 
CPM on a text ad is a waste of money.
Every time your ad shows, you pay for an impression. It does not matter if a user 
sees your ad or not—if the ad appears, you pay. So be careful about buying CPM ads 
on sites where users are highly engaged in the content or where the site generates many 
page views but very little time on each page. Here are some examples:
••
Forum sites
••
Image-sharing sites
••
Social networks
••
Ads below the fold
Before you can bid CPM, the campaign must be set to appear only on the 
Display Network. Once you have enabled a campaign to be shown on display only, 
when you examine your bidding options in your campaign settings you will have an 
additional option to bid CPM (Figure 9.31).
When you use CPM bidding you also have the option to enable viewable CPM 
(Figure 9.31). When you enable this option, you accumulate statistics (and pay) only 
when at least 50 percent of your ad has been seen for at least one second.

■  Sm a rt Pr ici ng: M e asu r e Succe ss w i t h Cost per Con v ersion
313
Figure 9.31  Enabling CPM bidding in the campaign settings
This is a good option to use if your ads are often shown below the fold. When 
you use this option, you often have to increase your CPM bids to have your ads dis-
played since Google is going to compare how often your ads are viewed and how much 
they make when your ad is viewed against other advertisers who may be willing to pay 
for the impression even if their ad is not viewed.
With CPM bids, you will first set a bid at the ad group level. This is the default 
bid that all new placements will receive. You can adjust this bid either higher or lower 
for each placement.
When using CPM ads, you are generally trying to raise the awareness of your 
products, services, or brand. Therefore, your ads should not contain specifics, such 
as prices. They should be memorable and easy to recall. If you want to add a call to 
action, do not make it commercial in nature. Instead, use a call to action that lets con-
sumers know that you will teach them valuable information.
CPC bidding gives you more control of your spending each time someone visits 
your website. If you want to examine the cost per conversion for an ad group or place-
ment and then set a bid based on those metrics, you should use CPC or CPA bidding. 
If you are using text ads, do not use CPM bidding. In cases where you are unsure of 
which bidding type to use, start with CPC bidding, since you should have more experi-
ence with it because that is the primary method that AdWords utilizes.
In general, if you want to control costs, use CPC or CPA bidding. If you want 
to maximize your exposure, CPM bidding is more effective. Once you have created a 
placement ad group and chosen the bidding type for the campaign where that ad group 
resides, it is time to manage the bids for each of those placements.
Using Frequency Capping to Limit the Number of Times a User Sees Your Ads
There are times when you might want to limit the number of times a unique user 
views your ads. If you are trying to reach the most users possible, especially if you are 

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
314
bidding by CPM, you might want to pay only for a single person to see your ad a few 
times. This is called frequency capping. If you limit the number of times a single user 
sees your CPM ads, you will not use up your budget on only a handful of users but 
instead spread out your budget among many users.
Frequency capping only works to control the exposure of your display ads. 
However, it applies to both keyword and placement display exposure.
You cap impressions by specifying the maximum number of impressions you 
want any one user to see over a timeframe (day, week, or month) and whether the cap 
applies to individual ads, ad groups, or your whole campaign. To enable frequency 
capping, navigate to the Campaign Settings tab and click Edit next to the Frequency 
Capping text (Figure 9.32).
Figure 9.32  Frequency capping interface in your campaign settings
For CPC bidding, frequency capping is usually not necessary, because you are 
paying only on a per-click basis. The only reasons to worry about frequency cap-
ping with CPC ads are if you are having display Quality Score issues or you just want 
to make sure you are not annoying people by showing your ad too often. Frequency 
capping is most commonly used in CPM campaigns or in remarketing (discussed in 
Chapter 10). Why pay for one person to see your ad a thousand times? Instead, pay for 
someone to see it a few times and then use the rest of your budget to reach more total 
users.
Using the Display Planner Tool
The Display Planner tool (Figure 9.33) has been shown throughout this chapter, and it 
is very similar to the Keyword Planner tool discussed in Chapter 3 from a navigational 
and feature standpoint.
However, there are a few filter options and data display options that are differ-
ent than those in the Keyword Planner tool that we need to cover.
If you click the Filters option on the left side of the screen, you will be presented 
with a list of ways that you can filter the data that is being displayed (Figure 9.34).
Select Ad Formats  Not all publishers support all ad formats. If you are trying to find new 
placements for your image ads, then you will want to see only sites that support image 
ads. You can use the Select Ad Formats filter to see only placements that support cer-
tain ad formats such as text, video, or image ads.

■  Usi ng t h e Displ ay Pl a n n er Tool
315
Figure 9.33  Display Planner overview
Figure 9.34  Display Planner Filters
Show Only Expandable Inventory  Certain ad formats require expandable inventory; these are 
ads that expand once the user hovers over the ad. If you are trying to find placements 
that support expandable ads, then you will want to turn this filter on.

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
316
Select Ad Sizes  If you have created a certain set of ad sizes, then you can filter the results 
to sites that have ad slots available for those ad sizes.
Mobile App Placement Ideas  If you are looking for mobile app placements, then you can fil-
ter by the operating systems of Android or iOS.
The other major difference between the two tools is the data displayed. With 
the Keyword Planner tool, the data is based on actual search queries. With the 
Display Planner tool, the data is based on ad impressions for the targeting method 
you have chosen. For instance, if you examine the data on the Ad Group Ideas screen 
(Figure 9.35), you will see the data for all the ad groups at once. If you navigate to a 
specific Ad Group Ideas screen, the data will be for that specific ad group.
Figure 9.35  Display Planner ad group data
Available Network Inventory (Weekly)  You can change the data to be based on a weekly or 
monthly basis. If you change the data to monthly, then the columns that display weekly 
data (such as impressions per week) will also change to show monthly data instead of 
weekly data.
Cookie Data  This is the number of cookies that can be set for the targeting methods. 
Please note that cookies does not mean unique users. If I were to see your ad on a site 
on my phone, then see your ad in my Chrome browser, then load your ad in Firefox, 
and then switch computers to view your ad in yet another browser, I can have at least 
four cookies.
Age  This is the percentage of users who fall into each age bracket for your data along 
with the Unknown user base. If you hover over the age data, you can see a pop-up that 
shows you the cookies by age range (Figure 9.36).
Gender  This is the percentage of users who fall into the Female, Male, and Unknown 
categories. You can hover over this information to see the cookie data for each gender 
classification.
Device  This information shows you on what devices the current targeting options will 
be displayed. In addition, you can hover over this information to see the cookie data.

■  Usi ng t h e Displ ay Pl a n n er Tool
317
Figure 9.36  Cookie data for age ranges
In addition to the entire plan data, you can see detailed data about each of the 
targeting methods (Figure 9.37) by selecting just that targeting method in the interface.
Figure 9.37  Viewing targeting method data
As you navigate through the options, ad groups, keywords, interests, topics, and 
placements, the data will change to show you all ideas (All) or only ideas for that select 
targeting method. In addition, there is some data you can see about the displayed data:
Ad Group  This is the name of the suggested ad group.
Contents  This is a sample of the proposed ad group contents. It may contain placements, 
topics, interests, or keywords.
Cookies / Wk  This is the number of cookies the proposed contents will set in a week.
Impr. / Wk  This is the number of impressions the proposed contents will show each week.
If you click into the contents of an ad group, you can see detailed information 
about the proposed targeting for that ad group (Figure 9.38).
For this data, the first two columns, Website and Ad Formats in Figure 9.38, 
may change based on the type of data you are viewing. For instance, the Website col-
umn will contain sites if you are viewing placement data and it will contain topics if 
you are viewing topic information.

Chapter 9:  U n dersta n di ng t h e Displ ay N et wor k  ■
318
Figure 9.38  Detailed content data
If you are viewing data about a website, then the Ad Formats column will show. 
If you are viewing data about other targeting methods, such as topics or keywords, 
then the ad format data is not displayed because Google does not know all the sites and 
their formats where those keywords or topics could be displayed within this tool.
If you hover over the Ad Formats icons, you can see the sizes of the image ads 
supported and if the site accepts text and video ads.
Relevance is an indication of how closely the proposed idea matches the goal of 
your advertising. For instance, if you have a site where a user can trade stocks, then 
advertising in a mobile app that gives real-time stock updates would be a highly rel-
evant targeting option. In that same scenario, advertising on the financial section of 
the Wall Street Journal is less relevant because that covers all stock information and is 
not real-time information. To finish off the example, advertising across the entire Wall 
Street Journal would have a low relevancy since many readers of other newspaper sec-
tions do not care about stock trading options at all. Always use your best judgment 
about how relevant you think a targeting option will be for your company; however, 
this is an easy way to get some quick relevancy data before you decide to add a target-
ing method.
Hist. CPM stands for “historical CPM.” That is the CPM range of the winning 
ads for that targeting method in the past week. If you know your target CPM, then you 
can use this as a benchmark to see if a site is at or below your target CPM before you 
add it to your plan.
The cookies per week and impressions per week data is the same as previously 
covered for targeting method data.
When you find targeting methods that you want to use in your account, you can 
add them to your plan. You can add either an entire ad group idea from the ad group 

■  Usi ng t h e Displ ay Pl a n n er Tool
319
screen or a single targeting idea, such as a placement or keyword, from the targeting 
details screen. As you add and remove items from your plan, you can see updated data 
about your plan (Figure 9.39).
Figure 9.39  Your plan information
If you plan on using frequency capping in your campaign, you can also set a 
frequency cap in your plan information (Figure 9.40). When you set a frequency cap, 
the number of impressions and cookies for that plan may change based on the caps that 
you set.
Figure 9.40  Setting a plan frequency cap
Once you have built a plan, you can delete it, download it, or review the esti-
mates before saving it to your account. Once the targeting options and new ad groups 
are saved to your account, you can create ads in those ad groups and start advertising 
across the Display Network.

Best Practices for the Display Network
Running your ads across the Display Network can help increase exposure for your 
business by increasing your reach, reaching non-searchers, and introducing your prod-
uct and services to start someone down the buying funnel. In other words, the reach 
of the Display Network is so vast that you can find many new customers on websites 
who will never search for your products. By implementing display campaigns, you can 
introduce your products to a significant number of web surfers who have never heard 
of your business. The following is a recap of critical points to remember when utilizing 
the Display Network:
••
Always run a campaign that is based on either display or search. Never combine 
search and display in a single campaign.
••
When creating keyword-based ad groups, do not use more than 50 targets, that 
is, more than 50 combined positive and negative keywords.
••
When creating keyword-based ad groups, use granular ad group organization as 
you would with search.
••
Target only one interest or topic in an ad group.
••
If there are topics or interests that you do not wish your ad shown for, add them 
as negative options.
••
Be careful of adding too many negative keywords to your campaigns or ad 
groups. If you want to protect your brand’s exposure, use site category options 
to block types of sites and content.
••
When you find sites that do not meet your performance goals, exclude them 
at either the ad group or campaign level. Alternatively, you could add that site 
into your campaign as a managed placement and manage it more closely—write 
ad copy specifically and set bids specifically for that placement. Focus on cost 
per conversion. With smart pricing, the click price and conversion rates are not 
nearly as important as cost per conversion.
••
To see the actual URLs where your ad is displayed, use the See Details option in 
the Placements section of the Display Networks tab.
••
Use managed placements to reach users on specific websites or in sections on 
those sites.
••
Use CPM bidding only with rich media or image ads. Usually, you want to use 
CPM bidding when your primary goal is to increase awareness of your products.
••
Use CPC or CPA bidding when you want to focus on bidding by cost per conver-
sion or you are utilizing only text ads.
••
Break down managed placement ad groups by themes so you can write targeted 
ads for each site where your ad is displayed.

This chapter outlined only the basics of creating display campaigns. There 
are ways of structuring your account that can help you take greater advantage of the 
Display Network. You can combine the targeting options or serve an ad only to those 
who visited your website but did not convert. In the next chapter, you will dive even 
further into additional features, flexible reach, and structure that will help make your 
display campaigns a success.

In this chapter you will learn how to combine the 
dizzying array of options in the Display Network 
with flexible bidding. You will learn how to 
target very small audiences and exceptionally 
large ones. With so many options available, the 
Display Network can become unwieldy. You will 
learn a strategy for managing and organizing the 
Display Network.
Remarketing allows you to bring lost cus-
tomers back to your site. This chapter explores 
several effective remarketing techniques.
Finally, this chapter shows you how to create

Remarketing: Bringing Visitors Back to Your Site
Remarketing campaigns (called retargeting in many non-AdWords circles) allow you to 
serve ads based on visitor behavior on your website. This is an excellent way of reach-
ing visitors who came to your site, showed some interest in your company, but left 
before completing an action.
The beauty of remarketing is that you are targeting the user. You do not have to 
use placements or keywords to target individuals. The other part of remarketing that is 
useful to know is that these do not have to be AdWords visits. You can target anyone 
who visits your sites. This is a great way of combining SEO (search engine optimiza-
tion) efforts or social marketing with AdWords.
First, we will walk through conceptually how remarketing works so you have a 
basic idea of the execution, and then we will dive into the specifics.
At a conceptual level, this is the remarketing process:
••
You define audience(s) in AdWords.
••
You place a script across your site or make a slight change to the Google 
Analytics code.
••
You make an ad group that only targets an audience.
••
When someone visits the pages where your remarketing script is placed, a cookie 
is added to their browser.
••
The visitor leaves your site, but the cookie is still on their browser.
••
That person then visits a site that is in the Display Network.
••
You can serve an ad to that person based on the cookie being placed on their 
browser regardless of the site they are currently on (assuming the site is in the 
Display Network).
••
Hopefully, the user clicks on the ad and returns to your site and performs your 
desired action.
With remarketing, you can also use Google Analytics codes instead of the 
AdWords code. The overall process is the same, except you will define some items in 
Google Analytics instead of within AdWords.
Define an Audience
The first step to remarketing is to create an audience. To create your remarketing lists, 
navigate to the shared library and click the Audiences tab.
On that page, you can see a list of all your current remarketing lists (Figure 10.1) 
and create new lists.
It is important to note that you can have both positive and negative lists that 
function like positive and negative keywords. For instance, you might have one list 
that triggers your remarketing ads based on users who made it to a specific product 

■  R em a r k et i ng: Br i ngi ng V isi tors Back to You r Si t e
325
page and another list that is a negative list for those who just saw one page of your site 
and then bounced off it, so that you do not spend money on those who do not care 
about your offer.
Once there, it is time to define your first remarketing list (Figure 10.2).
Figure 10.1  Audience information in the shared library
Figure 10.2  Defining a new remarketing list

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
326
When defining your audience, you need to define a few pieces of information:
The first item to define is the Remarketing List Name. This is what you want the 
list called. Usually calling it something obvious based on how visitors will be included 
in your list is the best way to name your lists. Naming conventions such as checkout, 
visited women’s apparel, and in shopping cart can help you to remember exactly where 
this code is being placed.
Next, you need to define how someone will be added to the list. In this step, 
there are two items that you will need to define. The first is how the user is added to 
the list (such as visitors of a page), and the second is the value, such as the URL.
Visitors of a Page  In this scenario, you can define a specific page on your site that if a visi-
tor goes to it, they will be added to your list. Since this could be a single page visit, it 
is rarely a good idea to add this to your landing page or your homepage because the 
visitor might just bounce off your site and you are still trying to spend money on a user 
who does not care about your offer. This is a good option to use when a user made it to 
your shopping cart or saw a thank-you page of your site.
Visitors of a Page Who Did Not Visit Another Page  In this scenario, you are adding users to your 
site who just bounced off your site because they went to one page and did not go any 
further. This can be a good option to use if you are building a negative list.
Visitors of a Page Who Visited Another Page  This list will be built off non-bouncers since the 
user did go to at least two pages of your site. This can be a good method to use for 
smaller sites and beginners who want to try remarketing but want to remarket only to 
those who care enough about the site to visit at least two pages.
Visitors of a Page within Specific Dates  If you run short-term promotions and then want to 
bucket users based on the promotional types they are interested in viewing, this is a 
good list type to use.
Visitors of a Page with a Specific Tag  When you define remarketing lists that are not custom 
combinations, the lists are also known as tags. You can then set a remarketing list 
based on a user being in one or more tagged lists. If you have several remarketing lists, 
you can combine them using this option to bucket the various lists together.
With these options, as you choose which option you want to employ to build the 
remarketing list, the rules box (Figure 10.3) for how a user is included will also change 
based on the criteria that need to be defined.
Figure 10.3  Defining the page rules to include users in your remarketing list

■  R em a r k et i ng: Br i ngi ng V isi tors Back to You r Si t e
327
For instance, if you were to choose Visitors Of A Page Within Specific Dates, 
then a date box would also appear within the rule definition box. If you use the option 
Visitors Of A Page With A Specific Tag, then you will see a box with all your tags that 
can be added to or removed from the list.
Finally, you can choose the cookie duration, which is how long the cookie will 
remain active on the visitor’s browser, and write a description for the list that will help 
you remember its purpose.
The initial list definitions for how a user is included in your remarketing list 
allow you define tags and basic lists. There is also an advanced list-creation function 
known as custom combinations.
Custom Combinations
Once you have a few lists created, you do not always have to create a new list; you can 
use custom combinations. With a custom combination (Figure 10.4), you can make 
simple rules that tell Google that if someone is in list A or list B, you want to add that 
user to the combination. Or, you can tell AdWords to include someone from list A but 
exclude anyone in list B.
Figure 10.4  Custom combination example
A custom combination lets you combine lists to create list combinations that you 
will use in your ad groups to target users (Figure 10.4). For instance, you could make a 
combination that is users who visited a specific page of your site but not users who saw 
only one page of your site. That way you are targeting only non-bouncers who saw a 
specific offer.
I’ll walk you through executional strategies shortly, but first I want to show you 
an example of why you would want to use a custom combination list. I work directly 
with Google to occasionally give in-person seminars about AdWords. When someone 
comes to our seminar page, we place one cookie on their browser (called AdWords 

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
328
Seminar Visits in the custom combination list). When someone checks out and buys a 
ticket, we place a second cookie on their browser, Seminar Registration Complete.
In our custom combination example, if someone visited the Seminar page but 
did not convert, they are in the list. If someone visited that page and then did convert, 
they are not in the list. In this fashion, we can then selectively serve ads to noncon-
verters and not spend money advertising to those who already bought a ticket to our 
AdWords Seminar.
You can always see how many active cookies exist at any time on the 
Remarketing List screen in the shared library by examining the column List Size 
(Display Network) in Figure 10.5.
Figure 10.5  Audience lists and active cookies
If you click into the list, you can also see some specific information about how 
the list is being used, the demographic information for the list, and the overall list size 
change over time (Figure 10.6).
Place the Script on Your Site
Once you define a list, you will receive a code (Figure 10.7) that goes on your website.
In the past, you needed a different code for every list and you might have 
ended up with many scripts across your site. That is no longer true. You can now put 
one code across the entire site, and once the code is implemented, there is no need to 
change the code when you add or remove lists. You can put this tag in a global footer 
just before the close body tag, </body>.

When you put the tag on your site, you must also adjust your privacy policy 
page to tell visitors you are using remarketing. This is a Google Terms of Service rule. 
The policy adjustment must also let consumers know how to opt out of remarketing. 
To learn more about creating a good privacy policy, you can see our very transparent 
privacy policy at http://certifiedknowledge.org/terms-of-service/#privacy. Before you 
just copy and paste that policy, make sure you talk to your lawyer about what you may 
need in your policy or the policy implications.
Create a Remarketing Ad Group
It is useful to create a new campaign for just remarketing. We will cover some of the 
advanced targeting options later in this chapter, but if you add a remarketing list to an 
ad group that has placements set and both of these settings are set to Target And Bid 
for how the ads are displayed, then your remarketing list will go active only if the user 
is on a selected placement and is on your remarketing list. It is easy to end up with ad 
groups that target so few people that you might never get an impression.
With remarketing campaigns, you can target based on just audiences. You do 
not need keywords or placements. Therefore, for your first remarketing campaign (and 
as you play with them, feel free to refine this targeting), you will set the campaign to 
show only on the Display Network, and you will not add other targeting methods (such 
as topics or interests) to that campaign. Instead, in your remarketing campaign, you 
will focus only on negative items, such as placements that do not convert.
When you create a new display campaign, there is an option to create a remar-
keting campaign (Figure 10.8).
Figure 10.8  Creating a remarketing campaign
However, if you use this option, you will not have access to all the features of a 
display campaign, such as setting bid modifiers by location. In most cases, you should 
always create campaigns using All Features for either search or display campaigns and 
not use the Remarketing campaign option.
Once you have a new campaign that will be used only for remarketing, navigate 
to the Ad Group tab and create a new ad group based on Interests & Remarketing 
(Figure 10.9).

■  R em a r k et i ng: Br i ngi ng V isi tors Back to You r Si t e
331
Figure 10.9  Create an Interests & Remarketing ad group.
You can add the remarketing lists or custom combinations that you want for the 
ad group from the ad group wizard screen and then save the ad group and create your 
ads. If you have more than one remarketing ad group that you want to create, repeat 
the process until all your remarketing ad groups are created.
If you want to change the lists in the ad group, as with all Display Network tar-
geting options, navigate to the Display Network tab and click the +Targeting button.
If you have certain negative lists that you want to add to the ad group or the 
campaign, you can do so in the targeting options under Exclusions (Figure 10.10).

Your ads will now be displayed based only on your remarketing lists. The 
next step is to navigate to the Ads tab and create additional ads that are associated to 
the list.
Read Google’s Remarketing Policies before Writing Your Ads
Google’s remarketing policies are quite strict, and it is easy to violate them if you do not read them. 
For example, one of the policies states that you cannot claim to know someone’s religious affiliation. 
There was a Christian dating site that always used “Christian Dating” in their ad copy, which was fine 
for all their ad groups except for remarketing. That ad copy ran into issues with remarketing because it 
listed a religious affiliation.
You can see the policies for yourself at https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/
answer/143465?hl=en.
The 100 Cookie Rule
A remarketing list must have placed 100 active cookies in the past 30 days before the 
list is active and associated ads go live.
When planning your remarketing campaigns, you will find it useful to have your 
analytics program open and examine the number of unique visitors to a page, or web-
site section, in the past month to ensure you can make a list go active by hitting 100 
active cookies.
When the remarketing code has been active on your site for at least a month, 
you can also estimate the list size from the list-creation screen to ensure that a list can 
go active.
Once you have written your ads and have audiences listed, and those audiences 
have 100 cookies set for the past 30 days, you are remarketing and trying to bring back 
visitors to your site. Those are the basics of remarketing. Next, let’s examine ways of 
organizing your remarketing campaigns based on your website.
Remarketing Strategies
With remarketing, you have four main variables that allow you to create custom mar-
keting lists:
••
Cookie duration
••
Pages and custom combinations for where the cookies are placed
••
Positive lists
••
Negative lists
Let’s look at a few common ways to set up remarketing campaigns.

Basic: Visitors and Converters
The most basic way of remarketing is to create two lists:
••
Nonconverters
••
Converters
The nonconverter list will be from 7 days to 60 days in length for most sites. To 
determine the cookie duration, examine your analytics to see how many unique visitors 
you receive a month and the average time between first visit and purchase.
Be careful of placing the nonconverter list on the homepage or on pages of blogs 
and forums. Often someone who just visits your homepage or your blog is not a very 
engaged visitor, and in many instances you may not wish to remarket to this visitor. In 
this case, you can also use the option for a user who visited at least two pages of your 
site so you are remarketing to more engaged visitors.
The converter cookie will last for a year and go on the thank-you page that 
appears only after a visitor has completed some action.
Your positive list will be nonconverters. Your negative list will be converters. 
Now you will show ads only to those who visited your website and did not convert. For 
this example, you could also use the custom combination of someone who is in your 
nonconverter list but not in your converter list.
Intermediate: Visitors, Abandons, and Nonconverters
With this setup, you will start with the same framework as the basic version you just 
saw. However, you will add one more cookie: Abandoned Cart Shoppers.
The Abandoned Cart Shoppers list will be defined by those who were inside 
your shopping cart or on the middle pages of a multipage form. Because these visitors 
are more valuable than those who just visited your site (they almost converted), this 
cookie duration will be longer than for your basic visitors.
Next, add the Abandoned Cart Shoppers list as another ad group. Someone who 
almost converted is worth more than someone who just visited your site. Therefore, 
your Abandoned Cart Shoppers CPC will be set higher than your website visitor audi-
ence. You should be willing to pay more to bring back an abandoned shopper to your 
site than just a typical visitor.
In this instance, you can also make custom combinations for those who were 
in the abandoned shopping cart list but did not convert or those who were engaged 
with your website but did not visit the shopping cart. These custom combinations will 
ensure that the user cannot see an ad from both lists at once. If a user can be targeted 
from two different lists at the same time, Google will show the user the ad based on 
the highest ad rank.

Advanced: Targeting by Interest
You can take your remarketing efforts to fairly granular levels if you have enough traf-
fic. For our AdWords training and tool site, we have several types of visitors. So before 
even setting up the lists, I made a simple table of what our lists would be, where we were 
going to place the codes, and how long each cookie would be enabled (Table 10.1).

And before we started, I laid out the execution strategy in a simple document so 
that the entire company could see how the site worked and view our customer acquisi-
tion strategy for remarketing. Our initial remarketing strategy with comments follows. 
Since you can use either custom combinations or positive and negative lists to achieve 
the same goals, I will list it as simply as possible with just positive and negative lists, 
but you can set these all up as custom combinations as well.
Ad Group 1: Nonengaged Users
This ad group is for users who visited at least two pages of the site but did not enter 
a specific section of the site. Therefore, they are the least qualified of all the visitors. 

■  R em a r k et i ng: Br i ngi ng V isi tors Back to You r Si t e
335
This is the reason the cookie duration for this list is only 30 days, the shortest of all 
the lists.
••
The positive list: All Visitors.
••
The negative lists: All the other lists. If someone is on any other list, we don’t 
want them seeing our general ad; we want a more specific ad served to that user.
••
The ad: Showcasing all benefits.
••
Bid: Lowest of all the remarketing lists. These visitors went to at least the 
homepage and one other page but not one of the specific pages useful for tailor-
ing a separate ad for that user.
Ad Group 2: Price Shoppers
This ad group is for users who visited the pricing section.
••
The positive list: Pricing.
••
The negative lists: All others except the All Visitors list.
••
The ad: Showcasing that your time is worth money and then showing how 
Certified Knowledge can save you time.
••
Bid: Second lowest of all the remarketing lists. Price-conscious users can be 
difficult to convince. In addition, I’d rather the more specific ad (the ad groups 
below) be shown to consumers instead of this ad. If someone happens to be on 
both the Nonengaged Users list and the Price Shoppers list, they should see this 
ad because its bid will be higher than the bid for the Nonengaged Users list.
Ad Group 3: PPC Community
This ad group is for people who visited the PPC community pages. I expect that most 
people who visit these pages will also visit other pages across the site. Therefore, while 
this will be an ad we show, we’re going to put less importance on what I expect the 
stronger benefits to be: Tools and Training. However, if someone did visit these pages, 
we’re willing to show them this ad (in addition to other ads they may see from the more 
specific ad groups).
••
The positive list: PPC Community.
••
The negative lists: All others except Price Shoppers and Nonengaged Users.
••
The ad: Showcasing the benefits of having access to an active forum, email, and 
news system.
••
Bid: Third lowest. Higher than Price Shoppers; lower than PPC Tools and 
AdWords Tutorials.

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
336
Ad Group 4: AdWords Tutorials
This ad group is targeting consumers who examined our tutorials. Because we have 
several pages explaining the tutorials, we can break this down into two lists over time: 
the Main Tutorials page and the All Training subpages. Doing so will help us identify 
those who just glanced at the tutorials versus those who looked at our videos and read 
more about the AdWords lessons.
••
The positive list: AdWords Tutorials.
••
The negative lists: Converted Subscription, Converted Email Training, Shopping 
Cart Abandoners. If someone converted, or was closer to converting than just 
visiting the features pages, I want them to see the more specific ad.
••
The ad: Showcasing what Certified Knowledge can teach users about AdWords 
with more than 100 video lessons.
••
Bid: Higher than PPC Community and lower than the three lists used here as 
negatives.
Ad Group 5: PPC Tools
This ad group is targeting consumers who examined our toolset. Because we have sev-
eral pages explaining the tools, we can break this down into two lists over time: the 
Main Tools page and the All Tools subpages. Doing so will help us identify those who 
just glanced at the tools versus those who looked at our videos and read more about 
the tools.
••
The positive list: PPC Tools.
••
The negative lists: Converted Subscription, Converted Email Training, Shopping 
Cart Abandoners. If someone converted, or was closer to converting than just 
visiting the features pages, I want them to see the more specific ad.
••
The ad: Showcasing the benefits of the PPC tools we have developed, which will 
save users time in creating ad copies, geographic keywords, and keywords. They 
will help users bid, find Quality Score issues, find broken links, and analyze 
their site. While most of the ad groups will contain two or three image ads to 
start (by themes, each theme will have different sizes), I expect this ad group will 
have more test ads to see what messages resonate better.
••
Bid: Same as the AdWords Tutorials. I expect it will become slightly higher than 
the tutorials over time because tutorials are one- to three-time views for most 
consumers, and many repeat views will help refresh their knowledge. The tools 
will be used daily, weekly, or monthly depending on what users are trying to 
accomplish inside their account and will grow more valuable over time.

Ad Group 6: Converted Free Email Training
This ad group is for targeting those who signed up for free lessons via email. Many 
people who sign up for free training do not have an intent to buy—they just want the 
free stuff. Others want a trial of what you are offering and have a high chance of con-
verting. However, email open rates can be sporadic on free training offers. Therefore, 
these ads will both remind users about Certified Knowledge and serve as a reminder 
about the emails delivered to them.
••
The positive list: Converted Free Email Training.
••
The negative lists: Converted Subscription, Shopping Cart Abandoners.
••
The ad: Showcase the Certified Knowledge tutorials with messages to remind 
users about their email subscription. When we first started, we tested messages 
such as “Did you enjoy your free email training from Certified Knowledge?” 
“Learn how you can access all of our training,” and messages focused just on 
benefits of the site. I wasn’t sure how creepy it would be to people to see ads 
that show we know they have our emails or if the messages that contain images 
aligned with the training aspects of Certified Knowledge would do better. It 
turns out that marketers find it fascinating that we can show ads based on the 
fact that the user has seen our emails, and this did better than the other ads. 
However, in many cases, those types of ads do not do well because users are 
concerned about their privacy.
••
Bid: To start, a bit higher than AdWords Tutorials and Tools lists since these 
users were willing to give us a name and email address to receive the informa-
tion. Over time, the bidding for this list might change significantly up or down.
Ad Group 7: Shopping Cart Abandoners
This ad group is for targeting those who entered the shopping cart but did not convert.
••
The positive list: Shopping Cart Abandoners.
••
The negative lists: Converted Subscription, Converted Free Email Training.
••
The ad: Two ads showcase the Certified Knowledge benefits. One ad shows a 
phone number with the benefits and talks about support for any problems. I find 
that using three to five different remarketing ads leads to an overall higher con-
version rate than showing just a single benefit. This is pretty common to see in 
remarketing.
••
Bid: The highest of all the lists.
While this organization is for a site that is only roughly 1,000 pages with 
roughly 50 sales and information pages, it’s this type of organization where you have 
to start balancing time and possibilities because the lists can grow quite large and 

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
338
complex. If you examine a site such as Lands’ End (Figure 10.11) that has multiple 
levels of navigation and many product categories with subcategories, there are several 
ways you could organize the remarketing campaigns.
Figure 10.11  Lands’ End
A simple approach is to set a remarketing cookie in each major section (women, 
men, girls, boys, and so on) with an ad that examines that type of apparel. In addition, 
there should be a converters list and an abandoned shopping cart list.
AdWords Dynamic Remarketing
There is a way to automatically create remarketing lists for each of your products, but the setup is 
highly complex. To do so, you must use Google Tag Manager (https://www.google.com/tag-
manager/) and understand how to write either JavaScript, dom tags, or custom rules for placing 
all of the tags. You can learn more about this feature here: https://support.google.com/
tagmanager/answer/3002580.
Alternatively, if you are using Google Merchant Center, you can use the standard AdWords remarketing 
code with some dynamic variable replacements to create your lists. You can see more about this setup 
here: https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/3103357.

■  R em a r k et i ng: Br i ngi ng V isi tors Back to You r Si t e
339
You could segment each subsection, so you would have women outerwear, 
women shorts, women pants, women sleepwear, and so forth. That quickly becomes 
more than a hundred lists.
When considering how to break up your remarketing lists based on interest, 
you need to balance your time and your unique visitors (100 cookies minimum to be 
active).
Remarketing by Trends
Your current customers do not have to be negative lists. It can be just as useful remar-
keting to your current customers. You should be careful, though; you do not want to 
overwhelm visitors with your offers.
Many industries have trends in how their products are sold, or peak times, that 
occur the same way on a yearly basis. Take the flower industry; two of the biggest days 
are Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day. These two holidays are roughly 90 days apart. 
You should count this out for yourself, but for ease of illustration, we will assume they 
are exactly 90 days apart.
If someone bought from you on Valentine’s Day, they are obviously someone 
who purchases flowers. One of the most common Mother’s Day gifts is also flowers. So 
in this case, you would want to show a Mother’s Day ad to anyone who bought from 
you around Valentine’s Day in hopes of enticing them back to your site to buy their 
Mother’s Day flowers.
In this case, you can make two lists:
••
Valentine’s Day Buyers: 80-day cookie
••
Mother’s Day Offer: 100-day cookie
You set these cookies on the Thank You For Shopping page for the seven 
days preceding Valentine’s Day, Valentine’s Day itself, and the next two days after 
Valentine’s Day for those who forgot and need that last-minute (late) gift.
Next, go to your ad group and add these lists. The Mother’s Day Offer will be 
your positive list. The Valentine’s Day Buyers will be your negative list. For the next 80 
days, the person will be in the negative list and therefore not see your Valentine’s Day 
ad. After 80 days, the cookie will expire and the user will see your Mother’s Day ads 
for the week or so leading up to Mother’s Day.
In addition, you can also use the list-creation option Visitors To A Page Within 
Specific Dates to place the cookies.
You can be creative with remarketing once you understand your website, your 
customers, and how your products are researched, purchased, and hopefully purchased 
again. The biggest problem with remarketing is that you can start to scare your cus-
tomers if you don’t control your ad serving. You need to ensure that your remarketing 
efforts do not give the appearance of stalking people.

Don’t Creep Out Your Customers
Remarketing is fantastic when it is done properly. When it is done poorly, you can 
“creep out” your potential customers so they can come to despise your ads.
The major culprit for causing this emotional state is often an advertiser not con-
trolling how often their ads are displayed. You should always set a frequency cap when 
running remarketing ads. This is not an AdWords policy, but it is a good marketing 
policy. A frequency cap limits the number of times someone can see your ads. Go to 
the campaign settings of your remarketing campaign, and set a frequency cap.
The second way to combat ad fatigue is to use multiple ads within your remar-
keting campaign. It is common to see companies use different sizes of the same ad (for 
image or video ads) for their remarketing campaigns; however, that is just the same ad 
that has been resized.
If someone has seen the offer 50 times, the 51st impression is not going to be 
magical. Create a few different ads with different offers, using completely different 
themes (look and feel of the ads) and place them in the same ad group. Now when 
you show your ad to the same person a few times, you are rotating in new themes and 
offers. If offer 1 does not convert them, then maybe offer 2 will.
It is common to see what is known as search sessions or research sessions. 
Someone will start researching one product or service, and then later they will start 
researching a completely unrelated product or service. For instance, they were sit-
ting with their spouse looking at cruise specials and getaway vacation packages on a 
Saturday afternoon. On Sunday, the husband is watching a football game and decides 
the TV is too small. So, he goes to the computer and starts researching new TVs. At 
this point in time, the remarketing ads for the cruise vacation are useless. He is no lon-
ger researching cruises—he is researching TVs.
In the travel industry it is common for someone to take a few weeks between 
initial research and purchase. During those few weeks, the user is not always interested 
in vacations. Interests and research vary depending on other life factors. There are a 
few ways that you can take even more control over your remarketing campaigns so that 
someone sees the ad only when they are more likely to be in the proper research mode 
for your products and services.
The easiest way to do this is to add topics or keywords to your remarketing ad 
group. When you do this, you can set it so that a user sees your ads only when they are 
in your list and the page they are currently visiting contains your display keywords or 
is in the topic that you are targeting.
In cases where you are only trying to refine your lists by keywords, feel free to 
use general keywords such as vacation or cruises. You do not need to go into the depth 
of detail for these keyword lists (of course, you can if you want to, but that does make 
a lot more ad groups to manage) that you normally would go to in creating display 
campaigns.

■  Flex i ble Ta rget i ng: M i x i ng a n d M atch i ng Ev ery Displ ay Ta rget i ng Op t ion
341
When you refine your ad group by keywords, you will often see much fewer 
impressions. If your offer is very general (credit cards, cell phones, and so on), you may 
decide not to refine your ad groups with keywords. If you are afraid you will lose too 
many impressions, just do a test of the same remarketing list, but in one ad group there 
are keywords and in the other one there are no keywords, and see how they each per-
form. The best way to do this testing is with AdWords Campaign Experiments, which 
we will discuss in Chapter 15, “Implementing Testing Techniques That Will Increase 
Profits.”
This refinement where you add multiple filters before an ad can be shown is 
known as flexible targeting.
Flexible Targeting: Mixing and Matching Every Display Targeting Option
Throughout Chapter 9, “Understanding the Display Network,” and this chapter, we 
have covered all the individual ways that you can show your ads across the Display 
Network:
••
Display keywords
••
Placements
••
Topics
••
Interests
••
Remarketing
••
Age
••
Gender
••
Exclusions for all these options at the ad group or campaign level
••
Site category exclusions at the campaign level
While you can show an ad based on any of these individual criteria, with flex-
ible targeting you can mix and match these targeting options to show an ad or set a bid 
when a user meets a combination of these settings.
For instance, you could show an ad in the following situations:
••
If the user is on a managed placement and the page is about your keywords or 
topics.
••
If the user is on a page about a topic and is a certain age or gender.
••
If the user has shown an interest in a topic and is on a particular placement.
••
If a user is in your remarketing list and is on a page that meets your topic.
The options are quite dizzying because there are millions of potential combina-
tions. To cover them all would require a book that is much longer than this book in its 
entirety. So instead of focusing on every combination, we will first look at how to use flex-
ible targeting and then show some of the more common combinations. If you can learn 

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
342
to think about how these combinations work and see some examples, then you should be 
able to determine the best combinations that will let you hit your marketing goals.
Flexible Targeting Options
To see the targeting options, first navigate to the ad group targeting options by clicking 
the +Targeting option in the Display Network tab.
There are three overall rules when using flexible targeting. The first is that if an 
ad group has keywords, the keywords are always used to show the ad. Now you can 
have the combinations set to use your keywords and your placements before an ad is 
shown, which we will get to in a moment; however, if keywords exist in an ad group, 
they will always be used with any other options before targeting your ad.
With the other targeting options, such as topics and placements, you have two 
ways (Figure 10.12) to control the ad serving.
Figure 10.12  Flexible targeting options
When you use the first option, Target And Bid, your ad will be shown only if the 
user meets the criteria of that targeting option. For instance, if you choose Target And 
Bid for the topic Arts & Entertainment and you choose the interest category Celebrities 
& Entertainment News (Figure 10.13), then the ad will be displayed only if the user 
is both in the interest category Celebrities & Entertainment News and currently on a 
page that has been classified into the topic Arts & Entertainment.
Figure 10.13  Targeting a user who is in both an interest category and a page topic at the same time

■  Flex i ble Ta rget i ng: M i x i ng a n d M atch i ng Ev ery Displ ay Ta rget i ng Op t ion
343
As you combine the options, you can see a Venn diagram of the combinations 
a user has to be in before they can see the ad. The shaded area of where the diagram 
intersects is the conditions the user must be in before they can see your ad. If we add 
yet another combination, such as the placement NYTimes.com (Figure 10.14), then 
the diagram will change to reflect the new conditions in which a user must be in to 
see your ad, and you can see the potential monthly impressions of that combination 
as well.
Figure 10.14  Using three targeting methods at once
When you use Target And Bid as the option for the targeting criteria, it is essen-
tially an and modifier, such as interest and topic and placement, before the user can see 
the ad.
The other option (Figure 10.15) is Bid Only. In this case, your other targeting 
options will cause your ad to show, but you can set a bid override if the user meets 
these criteria.
Figure 10.15  Use Bid Only to just set bids for a targeting method.
For instance, if we continue with the example where we use interests and topics 
to trigger our ads, but we change the placement option to Bid Only (Figure 10.16), then 
we can set a base bid for the ad group, but we can override the bid if the user is also on 
a chosen placement.

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
344
Figure 10.16  Using Bid Only for placement targeting
For instance, we can set the ad group bid to $1. Then we can set the bids for 
each of our managed placements to $0.50. If the user is on a managed placement, then 
our bid will be $0.50; if the user sees our ad but they are on any other placement, then 
the default $1 bid will be used.
In addition, when you add an item as a bid, the diagram on the right side, as 
in Figure 10.16, will be updated to show which options are set to Target And Bid and 
which are set to Bid Only.
This essentially means that if you want to show an ad only if a user meets one 
or more criteria, then you would use Target And Bid. If you want to override your 
basic bid if the user also meets another criterion, then you would use Bid Only for that 
criterion. Just remember that this option is not available for keywords. If an ad group 
contains keywords, they will always be used in the targeting.
Bid Modifiers for Display
With the Display Network, you can set a basic bid at the ad group level. Next, you can 
set a custom bid by one targeting method per ad group (Figure 10.17). For instance, 
you can set your base bid to $1 and then enable custom bids for placements. This 
means that if a user is on a placement, the placement bid will override the default bid.
Bidding Types for Display
The screenshots and options in the flexible bidding section assume you are using max CPC bidding. If you 
are using one of the other bid methods (discussed in Chapter 13, “Devising Profitable Bid Strategies”), you 
may see different bid options or be unable to set a bid modifier, such as with CPA bidding.

345
Figure 10.17  Setting custom bids
If you want to further refine your bids by another targeting method, then you 
can also enable bid modifiers for the targeting method (Figure 10.18).
Figure 10.18  Enabling bid adjustments
In this case, we can now set our ad group bid at $1. Then, we can override the 
bid if a user is on a specific placement. Finally, we can set a bid modifier based on the 
user’s age. An ad group can have more than one bid modifier, but it can have only one 
default and one custom bid.
We will walk through a detailed example of using these custom bid modifiers 
in the age and gender refinement example within the “Flexible Bidding Examples” 
section.
Flexible Bidding Examples
While there are literally millions of potential combinations to show your ad or override 
bids, let us take a conceptual look at the most common ones to use.
New to the Display Network or Testing New Offers
When you consider the high-level steps to creating a conversion, there are three main 
aspects:
••
The inventory: in this case, the Display Network

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
346
••
The refinement of that inventory: such as topic targeting or targeting an indi-
vidual placement
••
The offer: your ad and landing page
The Display Network is made up of more than two million publishers who 
together serve more than one trillion monthly impressions. This is a huge network, and 
some of those publishers will convert for you and others will not.
When you first start using the Display Network, you need to test your offer 
first to find offer combinations that will meet your advertising goals. Since the largest 
variable is the publisher and their inventory, a good first combination to employ is key-
words or topics plus managed placements.
By using managed placements and then refining your ad serving by using key-
words or topics, you can start with only high-quality publishers in your niche that 
should convert. If your offer does not do well on those sites, then odds are it will not 
do well if you were to use larger targeting methods such as just keywords or topics.
Use the Display Planner tool to find a few publishers who have your target audi-
ence. If those publishers are large, then refine your inventory by also adding keywords 
and topics with the Target And Bid combination so your ad is shown only on top-qual-
ity publishers when their articles match your keywords and topics.
Next, test your offers: your ads and landing pages. If your initial offers do not 
convert, then continue testing until you find a combination that does work.
Once you find combinations of offers that are meeting your advertising goals, 
then you can expand your inventory by just using keywords or topics or by adding 
additional managed placements.
This is a good first step for most advertisers, especially those who have never 
used display targeting before (either on Google’s network or on other ad networks) to 
study the user behavior and interaction with your ads and landing pages to determine 
what combinations will bring you highly qualified traffic.
Refining Traffic from Large Sites
I have had a lot of success with advertising on very large sites such as NYTimes.com, 
eHow.com, and About.com. However, those sites are so large that most advertisers will 
not be successful with run of site buys. A run of site buy is when you buy inventory 
that can be shown on any page of a site. Since those sites have traffic that can range 
from how-to articles to the latest in technology news to information about foreign 
investments, most advertisers will not find success on every page of those sites.
Of course, this depends on your advertising goals. If you are trying to build 
awareness for a new credit card offer or to reinforce your cell phone brand, run of site 
buys can sometimes hit your goals. These types of advertisers are usually the exception 
and have deep pockets with which to buy advertising.

347
Most advertisers do not want to be on every page of the roughly 3 million pages 
that a site like About.com has. Instead, they want to be on only those pages where the 
article matches the products. This type of large inventory refinement is another good 
use of placements (the high-quality yet large sites) plus topics or keywords (the refine-
ment of that inventory) so you can be on high-traffic, high-quality sites yet still do so 
within your budget constraints.
Age and Gender Refinement
For the most part, just targeting a user by their age and/or gender will lead to a huge 
number of worthless impressions. In most cases, age and gender should not be their 
own targeting methods; they should be a refinement of your inventory.
Let us say that you sell baby food and diapers. In almost all cases, these are 
bought by moms and not dads. However, dads do occasionally buy these items. In 
addition, these items are usually bought by those between 18 and 44, but again, other 
age ranges do buy baby food and diapers.
In this case, you can start by adding the topics Baby Food & Formula and Baby 
Care & Hygiene.
Next, you have several choices about how you want to approach the age and 
gender modifiers. If you want to reach the most users, you would add age and gender 
as Bid Only and then set your bids higher if the user is in your target age range through 
the use of bid modifiers (Figure 10.19).
Figure 10.19  Age bid adjustments

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
348
In this instance, since you do not know additional information about the 
unknown category, you won’t use an adjustment, and as time passes and you collect 
stats, you can then refine your bid adjustments based on how each age range converts. 
Next, you can navigate to the Gender tab and also set additional bid adjustments.
This would be the method you would want to use if you wanted to reach the 
most people and have a large budget to do so. However, if you have a smaller budget, 
you would adjust the approach to the targeting options.
To refine the targeting even further, instead of adding age and gender as Bid 
Only, you could add it as Target And Bid and then add only the ages and genders that 
meet your target market. The last question is what do you do with the unknown cate-
gories? Because the unknown categories are often the largest percentage of the age and 
gender categories, if you were to exclude them, you would exclude both good and bad 
traffic, but if you have a small budget, that would be the best option. If you have the 
budget to market to the unknown categories, then you would include them along with 
those who are known to be female and between the ages of 18 and 44.
Placement Targeting Workflow
To take this example even further, once you advertised for a while, you would start 
examining your best and worst placements. If you find placements that are not convert-
ing, then you would add them as negative placements so you no longer spend money on 
those sites. If you find placements that are converting, then you would need to break 
them down into two groups:
••
Large sites that have a few pages that are sending converting traffic
••
Small sites or very specific sites where all the traffic matches your target market
For the large sites, you would want to add them as managed placements, but 
you also want to refine the inventory based on the criteria that have worked for you 
so far. In this case, you have two options. Option 1 is to add those sites as managed 
placements and then enable Bid Only for the same ad group. Option 2 would be to 
make another ad group for large site managed placements and then enable Target And 
Bid plus your other targeting criteria for these sites. In this way, your first ad group’s 
goal is to find good websites, and this second ad group’s goal is to control the bids for 
large sites that have converted.
Next, you will also have very small or very specific sites where all the traffic on 
the site matches your target market. In this case, it might be mom forums, sites just 
about infant care, and so forth. Since the entire set of visitors to that site matches your 
targeting criteria, you can make another ad group that employs only these small place-
ments as the targeting method, and you will not need to use any other refinements. 
This ad group’s overall purpose is to control the bid for these sites, like the large site ad 
group mentioned, yet it does not need bid refinements.

■  Flex i ble Ta rget i ng: M i x i ng a n d M atch i ng Ev ery Displ ay Ta rget i ng Op t ion
349
You can even take this organization further and create a second campaign for the 
placements that are converting. When you do this, you are using your first campaign as 
a discovery campaign. Its goal is to find placements that convert. The second campaign 
will be a managed placements campaign and will contain only placements that have 
proven revenue. The managed placements campaign will have a higher budget than the 
discovery campaign due to the fact that when it spends money on traffic, it has proven 
returns. In the first campaign, some placements will convert and others will not.
This example can be extrapolated to any type of display campaign that does not 
use placement targeting and uses keywords, interests, or other targeting methods to 
find good placements. At the end of all your targeting methods, what you are trying 
to find are publishers that convert. In some cases, you will need to refine the inven-
tory with topics or keywords on those top publishers; in other cases, you can adver-
tise across an entire website; however, this workflow (Figure 10.20) is a good way to 
manage your display exposure so you are spending the most money on sites that have 
proven revenues and spending less money on ad groups and sites where you are waiting 
to see what sites need to be blocked and what sites have such good traffic that you want 
to make them managed placements and spend more money on them.

Ambiguous Intent Words
Let’s look at one more example that has multiple targeting possibilities to think 
through how you can employ targeting methods or even negative targeting methods in 
order to reach your marketing goals.
For this last example, let’s revisit bleach yet again. In this case, let’s say that we 
are selling Bleach DVDs and we want to advertise across the Display Network.
The first step is to create a small list of keywords, such as these:
••
Bleach

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
350
••
Bleach DVD
••
Bleach anime
We would have more ad groups such as the DVD seasons, potentially episode 
titles, and so forth, but let’s keep this simple to explain the possible options.
Next, we would want to refine our inventory so that we do not receive clicks 
for those looking for bleach products for use with cleaning. We have two options for 
accomplishing this.
The first option would be to use the Target And Bid option to include the one of 
the topics for anime (Figure 10.21).
Figure 10.21  Potential topic targets
With this option, we are advertising to only double-qualified individuals: the 
page they are on is classified into a topic and it contains some of our keywords. This 
option will lead to less total traffic than our second option but also a lower CPA, 
which I will explain after we cover the second option.
The second option would be to exclude the topics that are about cleaning sup-
plies (Figure 10.22).
Figure 10.22  Topic exclusion adjustments

■  Op t i m i zi ng You r Displ ay Ca m pa igns
351
If we exclude only certain topics, then we will receive more traffic than with the 
inclusion option because we are excluding only a very specific set of pages, whereas if 
we do only an inclusion, we are including only a set of pages.
Some pages will not be classified either way, so if we use only the exclusion 
option, we will have some false positives and some clicks that will not have a chance 
of converting. If we were to use only the topic inclusion option, then the pages that do 
house our target market but are not classified as anime pages will not show our ads.
Therefore, the keywords plus topics will result in less total traffic than the 
second option but should also have a lower CPA. If we only exclude a topic, then we 
should have more total traffic, but some of that traffic will be unqualified, and there-
fore our CPAs will be higher than with the inclusion option.
This is often the great balance with marketing; what do you want more, total 
traffic or lower CPAs? To answer this question, look back to your marketing goals. If 
you are in doubt, then start with the most qualified traffic, make sure it converts, and 
then expand your targeting over time to find a balance that suits your advertising goals.
Optimizing Your Display Campaigns
In the previous chapter, we showed how to block a site from showing your ads. While 
this is a crucial step in display optimization, it is best to first know if your offer is con-
verting and if your ad is being placed appropriately before blocking traffic.
The first step to display optimization is ensuring that your ad is being placed on 
the proper sites. To see the actual URLs of where your ads were shown, click the See 
Details option (Figure 10.23).
Figure 10.23  View the URLs for where your ads were displayed.
Then click some of the URLs to look at the actual pages where your ad has 
been shown. If these pages are related to the type of targeting you are trying to achieve 
based on your targeting methods, there is nothing else to do at this point. If the pages 
do not look relevant to your ad group’s theme, you need to change the targeting in the 
ad group so that your ad is shown on more appropriate pages. Once you change the 
targeting methods in an ad group, let the Display Network accrue some more impres-
sions, and then repeat this step until you are seeing your ads on relevant sites.

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
352
Once your ad is being shown on the proper pages, the second step is to find 
high-quality sites where your ad has been shown. Look for newspaper sites or sites 
you recognize by name without having to look them up. These types of sites should 
be sending you high-quality traffic. If the traffic from these sites is converting, then 
again you are finished and can move to the next section, “Organizing Your Display 
Campaigns.”
Understanding Site Quality
Personally, I like to place websites into one of four categories: low-quality, low-traffic, medium-
quality, and high-quality sites. I define them as follows:
Low-Quality Sites  These are sites that you look at and you just do not want your ad on the site. 
Often this is automatically generated content, scraper sites, or sites that have more ads than content 
on them. Feel free to block these immediately, because often they will not convert or do not fit your 
brand message.
Low-Traffic Sites  Usually these are small sites that do not have much traffic and therefore do not 
send enough traffic to make it worth your time to create specific offers for them.
Medium-Quality Sites  These could be local newspapers, for example, or sites in your niche that you 
are familiar with, but they are not the authority sites in your industry.
High-Quality Sites  These sites are either the authority in your niche or sites that everyone knows. 
These sites have the potential to send large amounts of high-converting traffic.
If a site is of low quality and not converting, then I will block it quickly. If a site is of high quality and 
not converting, then I will examine my targeting methods and offers.
If the traffic is not converting, your ad copy and landing pages may not be in 
proper alignment with your targeting methods. If you find that it’s not only high-qual-
ity sites that are not converting but that most sites are also not converting, you need to 
improve your ads, landing pages, targeting, or all three before it is worthwhile to spend 
money on the Display Network or refine your exposure by blocking these sites.
In the case of low-converting traffic, instead of having your ad shown all over 
the Display Network and trying to find where you are receiving high-quality traffic, 
use only placement targeting or placements plus keywords or topics until you perfect 
your offer.
Note:  A publisher can choose to block an individual advertiser or to not allow placement targeting on their 
website. If you find sites where you cannot seem to have your ad displayed, it might not be your marketing efforts. 
There is no way to know if a publisher has blocked your ad from showing.

■  Op t i m i zi ng You r Displ ay Ca m pa igns
353
Choose a handful of high-quality sites in your niche, and have your ads shown 
on only those sites; refer to the example “New to the Display Network or Testing New 
Offers” earlier in this chapter to see the steps. You can also run some ad and landing 
page tests (discussed in Chapter 15) to find what combination of ad copy and landing 
page converts. Once you have found a combination that works well, you can expand 
your display targeting by adding additional targeting options.
There will also be times when you find that a category of websites is not work-
ing for you. For instance, if you are doing well on high-quality sites but local newspa-
pers are not converting, rather than just blocking these sites, you can create a new ad 
group that uses managed placements or managed placements plus keywords and topics 
to test different ad copy and landing pages to discover whether some different combi-
nation works well on just those types of sites.
You may often see that social networking sites (such as Facebook) perform quite 
differently than local newspaper sites or forum sites. Therefore, even testing different 
types of websites together can help you determine whether you are more or less likely 
to convert the traffic on those sites. The same user is in a different mind-set when on 
Facebook as opposed to a newspaper site, and that difference in mind-set can make a 
difference in conversion rates.
Whenever you find good traffic from an individual website or a combination of 
similar websites that is not converting, your first thought should not be to block these 
websites from sending you traffic. Your first thought should instead be to try to opti-
mize the ads and landing page for that traffic or use flexible bidding techniques to fur-
ther refine the traffic from those sites by adding filters. The more traffic you block, the 
fewer potential customers your company can have. By trying to convert the traffic with 
different offers first and then blocking second, you will constantly be improving your 
campaigns and finding more total customers.
Organizing Your Display Campaigns
With the Display Network, there are many ways to organize your campaigns. This is 
my preferred method:
••
One campaign for each targeting method that is used by itself (that is, ads are 
shown only for remarketing, topics, or keywords)
••
One campaign for each targeting combination routinely used (that is, placements 
plus topics, interests plus keywords, and so on)
••
One campaign for placements that have proven themselves to convert over time
Within each campaign, with the exception of placements, each ad group will use 
only a single targeting method. For instance, if I’m targeting 50 topics, each topic will 
have its own ad group. This way I can test the ads and control the landing pages for 
each topic.

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
354
The reason why placements are the exception is that I will organize them by 
placement type (newspapers, social sites, and the like) or by the ads that need to show 
on those placements.
With topic and keyword targeting, the main goal is to find sites that convert. 
Therefore, for these targeting methods, I employ a multiple-campaign setup process.
Discovery Campaigns  These campaigns may consist of several campaigns. For instance, one 
might target topics, one might target keywords, and others might be additional com-
binations such as topics in country 1, topics in country 2, and so on. To see this addi-
tional breakdown, please refer to Chapter 14, “Organizing Accounts Successfully.”
The goal of these campaigns is to find placements that convert. This is known as a 
discovery campaign. Some of these campaigns will make money and others will lose 
money, but that’s not the goal. The goal is to find what publishers out of Google’s more 
than two million will send traffic that meets your advertising goals.
Managed Placements Campaign  The other main campaign type we will call a managed 
placements campaign. This campaign is for websites that are meeting your campaign 
goals.
When you find sites in your discovery campaigns that are meeting your goals, block 
them in the discovery campaign and move them to a managed placements campaign.
When you move these placements, you also need to examine the placements to deter-
mine if you need to move the targeting as well. For instance, if you find a very large 
newspaper site that is sending you good traffic only when a certain topic filter is 
applied, then you need to ensure that the topic filter is also applied in the managed 
placements campaign. If you find a small site where all of the traffic across the site con-
verts, then this placement can go into an ad group that does not use any other targeting 
filters.
When you move the site to your managed placements campaign, examine your place-
ment report and set a bid for that specific placement based on the ROI it is bring-
ing your company. Then block this placement from being shown in your discovery 
campaign. Because you have targeted this site explicitly in your managed placements 
campaign, you want to utilize your discovery campaign to find new sites that are 
performing.
This campaign will have a higher budget than the discovery campaign since it contains 
only websites that have proven they will send your company traffic that meets your 
goals. You always want your ads to be shown on these websites, and setting a higher 
daily budget than the discovery campaign can help you sustain this converting traffic.
Interest Campaigns  Interest campaigns target the user and not the website, such as when 
you use remarketing or topic targeting. Therefore, it’s not the site that is causing the 
conversion; it is the user and the offer. For these campaigns, you can examine your 
placement data and block sites that are not converting, but often you will not have 

■  Op t i m i zi ng You r Displ ay Ca m pa igns
355
many sites that regularly send converting traffic from these targeting types because 
these users can be all over the Web. If you do find sites that regularly send traffic that 
converts, then you can also add them to a managed placements campaign. However, 
these campaign types will spend more time blocking poor traffic than adding new 
placements due to the targeting type reaching the user and not the website.
Once you have this organization completed, the next step is to run a placement 
performance report (examine the Display Network tab’s placement data). When you 
first start using this organization technique, you will not have any websites listed in 
your placement campaign; therefore, start by examining data from your discovery 
campaign. Use the data in this report to segment sites into three categories:
••
Sites that are not meeting your goals
••
Sites where you do not have enough data to make a decision
••
Sites that are meeting your goals
When you find sites that are not performing for you, block them in your cam-
paign settings. If you are not receiving the proper returns from a website, you no longer 
want your ad to be shown on that website.
How Much Data Should I Have Before Blocking Websites?
In Chapter 15, we will discuss statistical significance in performing tests. However, many companies 
do not wait to acquire statistically significant data before deciding to block websites—and with good 
reason. There are more websites across the Display Network than most companies could ever find to 
place their ads. Thus, it can be easier to quickly block low-performing websites, because your ad will 
just be shown on another site.
Make sure that you are receiving conversions from high-quality sites. If you are not, you will not be 
blocking sites appropriately. In addition, if you find categories of websites that are not performing 
well, you can try testing different offers on those types of sites before you block them.
Low-Traffic Sites  If I receive 50 to 100 clicks and no conversions, I usually block these sites. There are 
enough sites floating around the Display Network to replace the traffic from these sites. If you look at 
a site and it does not seem highly related to your offer, feel free to block it with much less data.
Medium-Quality Sites  If you have received 200 or more clicks and no conversions, then feel free to 
block this traffic, assuming you do not see a nonconverting theme, such as newspapers you should 
test before blocking.
High-Quality Sites  If one of these sites is not converting after a few hundred clicks, I like to create 
a flexible targeting ad group, with keywords plus placements, to first test a different offer. If the site 
just cannot convert even with offers, feel free to block it. Just remember that blocking high-quality 
sites can remove many potential customers, so you are better off trying to convert this traffic before 
blocking it.

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
356
If you do not have enough data to make a decision for some sites, do nothing. 
Let these sites accumulate more data before you decide what to do with them.
When you find sites that are doing well for you, you will want to add them as 
placements in your managed placements campaign. Since these sites are doing well, 
ensure that your ad will continue to be shown on these websites.
Before you add a site to your managed placements campaign, use the Display 
Planner tool and type in the URL of the website to see if there is more than one place-
ment available on that website. Smaller websites, or websites that are not easily broken 
down into categories, may have only single-placement options. In the case of single-
placement options, choose that placement. However, if it’s a larger site that can be bro-
ken down into sections (for instance, the New York Times has more than 50 different 
placement options), you may want to choose only a few of the available placements.
Using Google Analytics to Find Sites to Block
If you are using Google Analytics, you can see additional data such as bounce rates, conversion rates, 
and time on site for your placements. I find it is useful to create interaction goals (shown here) and 
block placements without much data based on how those visitors are interacting with your site. If a 
site has a 100 percent bounce rate after 25 visitors, either your landing page needs serious work or the 
placement will probably will not convert in the future because the traffic is not relevant for you.
If you have connected Google Analytics to AdWords, you can also build these types of filters within the 
AdWords interface.
If you want to be shown on every placement of a site that has multiple-placement 
opportunities, rather than selecting the entire site choose each individual placement. 
The reason to add all the smaller placements is that you can set a different bid for each 
placement even within a website. For instance, you could set a bid of $0.50 for the 
New York Times travel section, a $0.75 bid for the New York Times business section, 
and $1 for the New York Times technology section.

■  Cr e at i ng Scena r ios to U n dersta n d a n d R e ach You r Ta rget Au di ence
357
In addition, you will want to block these sites from being shown in your dis-
covery campaign. The discovery campaign’s purpose is to find new sites to place your 
ads. If you do not block a site from being shown in an automatic placement discovery 
campaign, your ad could still be shown on a site that is also listed in the managed 
placements campaign, and it will slow down the process of finding new sites that are 
performing for you.
Since each placement in the managed placements campaign can have its own bid, 
calculate the bid based on the returns that site is sending you (more about calculating 
bids in Chapter 13), and set that as the starting bid. Next, run a placement perfor-
mance report for the placements campaign and continue to refine bids based on each 
placement’s performance.
Repeat this process to find sites doing well and sites not performing, and then 
block and add them as necessary. To see a flowchart and actual examples of this type 
of workflow, please refer to the “Flexible Bidding Examples” section for the age and 
gender refinement (Figure 10.20), earlier in this chapter.
By using the process of first making sure your offer converts and then placing 
your ad around the Display Network and refining your exposure based on individual 
websites, you can achieve excellent results from the Display Network.
Creating Scenarios to Understand and Reach Your Target Audience
Using automatic placements (topics, keywords, and so on) for discovery, managed 
placements for high-return websites, and potentially flexible targeting and remarketing 
campaigns will lead to a scenario where you can start to control and refine your target-
ing based on returns. However, if you have a smaller budget, or you want to reach only 
a specific user, having a large-reach display campaign might not be cost effective or 
financially possible for you.
If you have a smaller budget, starting with managed placements or remarketing, 
determining what type of placements are doing well for you (news, social, forums, and 
the like), and then finding additional placements that meet those criteria can help you 
grow your content advertising in a more returns-oriented environment.
As you start to layer on more targeting options, it can become confusing to 
determine how to reach your target market. Instead of focusing on all the options, 
focus on creating real-life scenarios and then see what options apply to your audience.
Here’s a list of the ways you can target a display ad:
••
Time of day (discussed in Chapter 13)
••
Day of the week (discussed in Chapter 13)
••
Location (discussed in Chapter 11, “Utilizing Advanced Geographic Targeting 
Techniques”)
••
Individual website or section of a website (managed placements targeting)

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
358
••
Topics
••
Interests
••
Display keywords
••
Person’s previous behavior on your website (remarketing)
••
A combination of one more of these options (flexible targeting)
For general display reach that has some control, beginning with either keywords 
or managed placements is a good starting place—it is a nice balance between both 
reach and control. You can use all or none of the additional targeting options. Instead 
of trying to think through all the options, create a scenario for reaching your target 
market.
Even though someone is viewing your ad online, they still have a physical 
presence in the world where their life is dictated by offline factors and daily routine. 
Examine the life of your customer, and the targeting options can become apparent.
For instance, let’s assume that your company has just developed a product that 
allows stockbrokers to get real-time U.S. news results based on their portfolio. And 
let’s also assume that you are doing a limited test to view the response rate and have 
chosen Minneapolis as your target market. In addition, you do not have a limitless 
budget, so you want to refine your targeting as much as possible.
Therefore, the question is how do you reach stockbrokers who live in 
Minneapolis? Let’s begin by building a profile of how they receive their current news, 
since that is what your product addresses.
Because your company wants to reach only users in Minneapolis, the first set-
ting is quite easy: show the ad only in Minneapolis.
Next, a stockbroker has to be ready for the New York Stock Exchange to open 
at 9:30 a.m. EST. However, Minneapolis is on Central time; therefore, the stockbroker 
has to be ready for work at 8:30 a.m. Some will read the news at home, others at work, 
so let’s run the ad from only 5:00 a.m. until 10:30 a.m.
Most people behave differently on weekends than on weekdays. The weekends 
are for relaxing; the weekdays are about work. Therefore, we’ll only run the ad from 
Monday to Friday.
Where do stockbrokers read their morning financial news? Use the Display 
Planner to research financial news sites. For our purposes, choose a starting place of
••
Bloomberg.com, only one placement available
••
New York Times, business pages placement
••
Business Week, all placements except Asia and Europe
These three websites have a tremendous amount of daily page views, even when 
only that handful of sections is chosen. Therefore, also choose some keywords such as 
stock market, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, and NYSE.

■  W r i t i ng Ef f ec t i v e Displ ay A ds
359
Now, when you add all those components together, the ad will be shown only to 
those who meet all these criteria at once:
••
Located in Minneapolis
••
Viewing the New York Times, Bloomberg.com, or Business Week in one of the 
chosen placement sections
••
During a weekday
••
In the morning from 5:00 a.m. until 10:30 a.m.
••
When the article matches your keyword list
It is important to note that the more you segment your audience, the smaller the 
potential audience is, because they have to meet all the criteria.
If you have ads that are already running, when you start to refine your ad’s 
exposure, always track total conversions and conversion rate to make sure you did not 
prevent your ads from being seen by converting customers.
If you feel overwhelmed by the possibilities of the Display Network and all the 
options, step away from Google’s options and start thinking about the user:
••
Who is your ideal customer?
••
How do they live their life?
••
When during their daily routine are they more open to reading your ad and 
viewing your offer?
By examining those three simple questions, you can learn how to reach your 
customers.
Writing Effective Display Ads
Writing ads for the Display Network is different than writing search ads. With search 
ads, someone has conducted an actual search, which shows they are aware of the prod-
uct and service. The fact that a searcher has conducted a search means they are some-
where in the buying funnel.
When you are reaching individuals with the Display Network, many users may 
not be in the buying funnel at all. Your ads are shown based on the article’s contents 
or other targeting methods, but in most cases (in-market buyers for interest targeting 
being the exception) the ads are not just targeted to the user’s intent of actively seeking 
information. Therefore, you should be writing display ads to reach users who are not in 
the buying funnel so that they will enter your buying funnel.
Although some people who are in the buying funnel will see your display ads, 
they are often not your primary audience for such ads. You will reach those individuals 
when they are searching for your products. Your display ads will help reinforce your 
message for those who are in the buying funnel, and you may see conversions from 
these individuals. However, since those already in the buying funnel usually make up a 

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■
360
small percentage of those who see your display ads, they should rarely be your primary 
audience (with placement targeting and remarketing being the common exceptions).
When examining these ad copy writing rules, we are making the assumption that 
you are using the Display Network to introduce your existing product or service to con-
sumers to start them down the buying funnel. There are many other reasons to use the 
Display Network, such as CPM image ad buys to create awareness for a new product. If 
you are using the Display Network for some of these specific reasons, borrow what makes 
sense from the ad-writing sections here and in Chapter 8, “Beyond Text: Employing 
Image, Video, and Mobile Ads,” to create your own ads that meet your company’s goals.
Showcase Relevancy  The more relevant an ad is to the consumer, the more interest it will 
attract. Relevancy is attained by your keyword, placement, topic, or interest selection. 
Make sure your ad is relevant to the website it is being shown on. This point is as much 
about choosing the proper placements and keywords as it is about the ad’s design or 
chosen text. Ads that seem to underperform might be very effective ads but are under-
performing because they are being seen by the wrong audience. Always check to make 
sure your ads are being placed on the proper pages.
Showcase Benefits  The reason people move further into the buying funnel is that the 
product or service has made some promise about how it will make their life better. We 
become interested in products because of benefits. Since consumers who are reading 
related articles might be aware of similar products or services—and in someone else’s 
buying funnel—if your product or similar products are well known, you should test 
adding a feature or two in the ad along with your primary benefit.
What Will They Learn after the Click?  This is not necessary in every ad, but it is worthwhile 
testing. Tell consumers what they will receive when they click on your ad. By letting 
them know what they will learn, you might give those who have entered the consider-
ation funnel the incentive they need to click on the ad to view your landing page.
Call to Action  All ads should have a call to action. Tell a customer why they should click on 
your ad and what they should do on the landing page. Phrases like “begin your free trial” 
are calls to action that let customers know the next page will be a free trial sign-up.
Use General Offers  Too specific an offer can confuse a visitor who is not yet in the buying 
funnel and does not know about your products. General offers, such as “download a 
whitepaper,” “free trial,” and “calculate your savings,” create a compelling message for 
a general audience.
While these rules generally apply to all Display Network ads, you can be more 
specific with managed placement ads. For instance, if you sell server-monitoring soft-
ware and your ad is being placed on a site that caters to advanced IT individuals, you 
are reaching an audience that understands the benefits of server monitoring. In this case, 
your general consumer benefit may not be that compelling to an audience who already 
understands the entire monitoring process and knows they need it. They are interested

361
in new features that will make their lives easier that are not typical in other software. 
Therefore, you might need more specific benefits in your ad copy, such as why this mon-
itoring software is easier to use, that it is less resource intensive, or that it can send text 
messages when servers go down whereas most software just sends email notifications.
As a general rule, the more you know about your audience and the more specific 
the audience, the more your ads can be tailored to meet their needs. Conversely, the 
more general the audience, the more you should test specific versus general ads. Often 
specific ads will still outperform general ones even when broadly targeted, but it is not 
always true. Therefore, when targeting large audiences, your first round of tests should 
be specific versus general messaging.
Best Practices for Advanced Display Network Advertising
The Display Network has multiple layers of complexity you can use to display your 
ads, from using keywords to placements to keywords plus placements to complex flex-
ible targeting options. In addition, all of your typical campaign settings such as geog-
raphy, time of day, and budget also apply to display campaigns. With so many options 
available, it is often simpler to create scenarios for reaching your target audience and 
then examine the list of possible targeting options to best reach that audience.
••
If you add multiple targeting methods to an ad group and want the user to meet 
every condition before seeing your ad, use the option Bid And Target for each of 
your targeting options.
••
If you add multiple targeting methods to an ad group, such as placements and 
topics, and then you want to use bid adjustments for another targeting method, 
such as gender, then you would use Bid Only as the targeting option for gender. 
••
If you are placing your ads on either very large sites or a large number of small 
sites, refine your ad exposure by adding keywords or topics in the same ad group 
as your managed placements. This way, your ad will show only on the sites you 
want when the article also matches your keywords or topics.
••
If you are new to display targeting, start with just managed placements (or man-
aged placements and keywords or topics together). This gives you the most con-
trol over your ad serving to test your offers before expanding your reach.
••
Run the placement performance report. If a site is not performing for you, either 
take action to improve performance or block your ad from being shown on that 
site. If a website is performing for you, block it from the discovery campaign and 
add it to a placements-only campaign.
••
Remarketing will help you bring back potential customers so you can try to sell 
to them again.
••
When writing ads for interest targeting or very general display advertising on the 
Display Network, test general versus specific offers that are laden with benefits.

Chapter 10:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Displ ay N et wor k T ech n iqu e s  ■

The Display Network is about reach. There are more possible impressions and 
clicks on the Display Network than on search. Therefore, understanding your audience 
and writing ads to reach that audience will help you get not just clicks from the Display 
Network but conversions as well.
In the next chapter, we will discuss another way of reaching your target audi-
ence based on their location. With location targeting, you can make sure that only 
users in specific locations can view your search or display ads.

Utilizing Advanced 
Geographic Targeting 
Techniques
Location targeting allows you to show your ads to 
consumers in specific geographic regions, whether 
it is multiple countries or five miles around a sin-
gle zip code. The first part of this chapter focuses 
on how to show your ads to specific locations and 
some pitfalls that you should understand.
The second half of the chapter focuses on 
writing ads for different geographies and on using 
methods to engage users based on their knowledge 
of your target area and what they consider credible.
The chapter closes with a geographic report 
where you can find opportunities to optimize 
your account based on your performance in spe-
cific geographies.

What Is Geographic Targeting?
AdWords allows you to choose where your ads will be displayed. This is useful if you 
want to show a different message in different locations, set different budgets or bids by 
location, or optimize your spending based on returns from different geographies.
The benefit for a location-based business, such as a New York dentist or a Best 
Buy in Fargo, is fairly obvious: You reach only consumers who will travel to your busi-
ness location. Therefore, a plumber in San Francisco or a pizza delivery company in 
Dallas needs to show their ads only to those who are in their business area.
However, e-commerce and national companies often overlook the advantages 
of using location-specific online ads. If you examine the marketing of a company like 
Coca-Cola, you will notice different billboards and commercials in San Francisco as 
opposed to those that appear in New York or London. This is because consumers react 
differently to various messages based on their location norms.
All campaigns must choose in which geographies the ads in each campaign 
will appear. The default option is usually a country or bundle of countries. However, 
regardless of the reach you want your ads to have, it is a setting you should be aware of 
so that you know exactly where Google is displaying your ads.
Before exploring the location targeting options and how local, national, and 
multinational companies can take advantage of them, you must understand how the 
technology that is used to identify a user’s location works.
The Technology behind Location Targeting
Google identifies a user’s location in five main ways:
••
By looking at the Google property used for the query
••
By examining the explicit geographic keywords used in a search query
••
By inspecting the previous geographic keywords used in searches
••
By determining the searcher’s location based on their IP address
••
GPS device data
For our purposes, I will simplify these as much as possible and leave out some of 
the technology so these concepts are easy to grasp in the framework of a single chapter.
The first factor used to determine a user’s location is based on the top-level 
domain extension of the Google search engine being used. For instance, users in France 
go to Google.fr and users in Canada go to Google.ca. The country extension tells 
Google from which country a searcher wishes to see information.
The second is when a searcher uses an explicit geographic qualifier in their 
search query, such as Austin plumber. When a geographic qualifier is used, Google 
must feel confident that they understand the area for which the searcher is seeking 
information before they will decide which local ads to show for that query.

■  W h at Is Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng?
365
In the Austin plumber example, there are a few locations in the United States 
that use the word Austin. However, the vast majority of them are looking for Austin, 
Texas, information; therefore, Google may be fairly confident that the user is looking 
for that information and might therefore serve ads for Austin, Texas.
If you consider a query such as Washington plumber, the query could refer 
to Washington, D.C.; Washington state; Washington, Utah; or any of the other 
Washington-named cities or counties. In another example, there are two large cities 
named Kansas City. In both of these cases, Google will show fewer (or no) ads because 
they are not highly confident that they understand the user’s location unless the 
account uses a keyword that contains the geographic term. Google isn’t serving the ad 
because the targeting is set to that location; they are serving the ad because the search 
query matches the account’s keywords.
The third method that Google uses to show ads is based on a person’s previous 
search history. If you use explicit geographic qualifiers in the search query, which is the 
second method, Google has an idea of the location where you want to find informa-
tion and may use that information to target ads for other queries. If you do a search 
for Washington DC plumber and then follow that query with Washington kitchen 
remodeling, you may see geographic ads, because Google now has some idea that you 
have defined Washington, D.C., as your target location. In addition, if you search for 
Washington DC plumber and follow that query with kitchen remodeling, you might 
also see location-based ads even without a geographic qualifier in the search query, 
since Google remembers previous searches.
The fourth way Google shows location-based ads is based on your IP address. 
When a computer logs on to the Web, it is assigned an IP address. This could be con-
sidered your computer’s location on the Web. Many IP addresses are mapped to physi-
cal locations so that Google understands where you are located.
However, the IP address for your computer is not always your computer’s actual 
location: it’s your ISP’s location, otherwise known as your host provider. Therefore, 
the fourth method looks at ISP locations and IP maps and attempts to discern your 
location.
This leads to the following scenario: When you do any form of location target-
ing, whether it’s for a country or a city, three things are going to happen:
••
A searcher inside your target location will see your ad.
••
A searcher outside your target location will see your ad.
••
A searcher inside your target location will not see your ad.
If you want to show your ads only in Chicago, these are the three scenarios 
(Figure 11.1) that will occur:
••
Searcher 1 is inside your target area. The host mapping is in your target area. 
This is a perfect match.

Chapter 11:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng T ech n iqu e s  ■
366
••
Searcher 2 is outside your target area. The host mapping is in your target area. 
Though this searcher is outside your target location, they will still see your geo-
graphic ad.
••
Searcher 3 is inside your target area. The host mapping is outside your target 
area. Though this searcher is in your target area, they will still not see your geo-
graphic ad.

Location targeting will help you reach an audience with a unique message, give 
you the ability to raise your CTR and conversion rates in different locations, and make 
better use of your budget. Understanding the basics of how location targeting works 
will help you troubleshoot why certain groups of people are or are not seeing your ads.
How Accurate Is Location Targeting?
The first step in location targeting is to choose a location. This is a required setting for 
every campaign. Even if you used a geographic keyword, such as Chicago dentist, you 
must still set the United States, Illinois, or Chicago as the location targeting option in 
that same campaign.
Since you are often not targeting a consumer’s location but their host provider 
map, how accurate is location targeting? Before we get into the numbers, let’s look at a 
few exceptions that adversely affect location targeting:
The AOL Conundrum  AOL dial-up users all appear to come from Reston, Virginia. This 
means that Google cannot always show ads to AOL users based on their IP addresses; 
they must use other forms of technology or dissect geographic search queries to discern 
AOL dial-up users’ locations. As of August 2013, AOL dial-up has more than 2.6 mil-
lion subscribers in the United States and still has European customers as well. To reach 
AOL dial-up users, it is best to use geographic keywords in a campaign targeted at the 
country level, which will be fully explained in the section “Reaching Users in an Area 

■  W h at Is Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng?
367
Smaller than a Country.” While this is AOL specific, other dial-up and satellite provid-
ers have the same issue.
Corporate VPNs  When a user logs into their corporate virtual private network (VPN) and 
then accesses the Web, their location is often shown as their VPN’s location, which is 
commonly the corporate headquarters, not their actual location.
Data Cards  These are often called air cards or cell cards. They are connection devices 
you can attach to your computer so that your computer can access the Web via a cell 
connection. Often these cards show completely different locations than your cell phone 
on the same network. Although cell phones can use cell tower triangulation to deter-
mine location (and a few other methods, such as GPS), these additional data points are 
not always used in determining a computer’s location when accessing the Web from a 
data card. The search engine may not realize you are using a data card to access the 
Web. Therefore, a data card user may be assigned an IP address from the cell company, 
which might be in the exact same location or in a completely different state.
Cities That Cross State Lines  The Chicago metro area is primarily in Illinois, but it also 
encompasses areas in Indiana and Wisconsin. The Washington, D.C., metro area 
crosses into Maryland and Virginia. In these cases, you may see IP addresses assigned 
from an incorrect state. It is not a common occurrence, but it does happen.
The following unofficial estimates of location detection accuracy were calculated 
by talking with people at the search engine companies and by my own testing. The 
accuracy of these numbers is thrown off by the previous factors, as well as some other 
technological idiosyncrasies. Therefore, this is a rough compilation of all geographic 
areas; some areas will have higher degrees of accuracy and others lower. Here are my 
best but unofficial estimates for the United States:
99.9999 Percent for Determining a Country  The country of origin is easy for a search engine 
to determine. More than just IP data is used to establishing country of origin, and the 
search engines are highly accurate at determining country information. The most com-
mon issue that throws off country-level targeting is corporate VPNs.
90 to 95 Percent at the State or Region Level  That is an overall U.S. average. There are some 
states, such as California, where most of the population does not border another state. 
Therefore, most of the ISPs are in that state and the accuracy of state-based targeting is 
exceptionally high. Illinois has cities that border and spill over into other states: There’s 
Chicago in the north, which flows into both Indiana and Wisconsin, and in the south-
ern tip of the state, there’s the St. Louis, Missouri, metro area. These two areas cause 
some users in both the north and the south to potentially see ads from other states. 
However, the users in the middle of Illinois will mostly see Illinois-based ads. Each 
country has widely different accuracy levels at the state or regional level. Canada’s 
numbers are fairly similar to those of the United States. However, the accuracy of 
regional targeting in the United Kingdom is quite poor.

Chapter 11:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng T ech n iqu e s  ■
368
85 to 90 Percent at the Metropolitan Level  A metropolis is a city that influences adjacent neigh-
borhoods or cities. For instance, San Francisco is a city with a population of around 
800,000 people. San Francisco influences San Jose and Oakland. Therefore, the San 
Francisco metropolitan (often called metro) area is considered the entire region around 
San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose with a population over 7 million people.
Throughout the United States, I estimate the metropolitan accuracy at about 85 to 
90 percent. There are some cities where user location is easy to determine due to lack 
of ISP competition and rural areas outside of the city. Fargo, North Dakota, borders 
Morehead, Minnesota. The same metro area has two different names based on which 
state you live in. The areas outside Fargo are very rural. If you want to reach users in 
the Fargo metro area (users in Fargo and Morehead), your accuracy will be fairly high. 
However, if you want to reach users only in Fargo and not Morehead, your accuracy 
will be lower because some of the same ISPs service both areas.
75 to 80 Percent at the City Level  Reaching only users in a city can be challenging at times 
because although a city is a predefined geographic area, most ISPs create their infra-
structure based on the wider metropolitan area.
If you are targeting a city that is not in a metro area and is surrounded by rural areas, 
the accuracy increases. If you are trying to target a city in a metro area, the accuracy 
decreases.
For instance, if you are attempting to reach only users in Chicago city proper, your 
accuracy is high for the middle of the city, because the middle of the city does not bor-
der any other cities. Many users on the north side of the city of Chicago see ads from 
Evanston, a city just north of Chicago. Therefore, your accuracy when targeting the 
city of Chicago is high in the middle of the city and declines for users in the north. 
Since Evanston is still in the Chicago metro area, if you are targeting the entire metro 
of Chicago, the north-side residents will see your ads. This is why metro targeting is 
often more accurate than city targeting.
Please note that these are desktop averages or averages for users on phones 
that do not have GPS turned on. When GPS is active on a device, the accuracy rate is 
extremely high.
Google has tried to make location targeting more accurate by showing the loca-
tion within search results and allowing users to adjust their location to show more 
accurate results. These numbers reflect only Google search data. For Google Maps, 
searchers must use some location identifier and, therefore, the maps properties are 
highly accurate.
These estimates are rough guidelines, since there are many exceptions where the 
numbers could be higher or lower. None of these numbers should scare you away from 

■  R e ach i ng Users i n Speci f ic Locat ions
369
trying geographic targeting. Targeting a specific location with ads written for that loca-
tion is one of the more powerful combinations you will find in AdWords, regardless 
of whether you are a national company or a local company that serves only a single 
region.
Marketing is about connecting with users. People love and defend their local 
areas. Reaching consumers based on their geography allows you to connect with 
searchers not just by their search query but by their location as well.
Reaching Users in Specific Locations
Location targeting is set at the campaign level. To access these settings, navigate to 
the campaign Settings tab. In the Locations section you will see your current settings 
(Figure 11.2). To change your location settings, click the Edit link near your current 
location list to choose where you want your ad to be displayed.
Figure 11.2  Viewing and changing your location settings
Once you choose to edit your locations you will be presented with a list of 
your currently targeted locations and a search box where you can search for locations 
(Figure 11.3), and if you click either Nearby or Advanced Search, you can view a map. 
To ensure that you are targeting the correct locations, the map view is useful. For the 
purposes of limiting the number of images, we will only look at the map listings; just 
note that you can do these same searches directly from the campaign Settings tab.
Figure 11.3  Editing your location options
When you click the Advanced Search option, the map will be displayed and you 
can start to search for any geographic areas.

Chapter 11:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng T ech n iqu e s  ■
370
Finding Locations to Target
Once you have navigated to the maps section, you can search for locations that you 
wish to include. As you type, Google will present a list of locations that match your 
search result (Figure 11.4).
Figure 11.4  Searching for locations
The first locations to consider are the ones listed as matches for your location 
query. Depending on the search query, you may see matches that include your terms, 
matches that include your location, or related locations. For each match you have sev-
eral options. Next to each location you will also see the geographic area: country, state, 
province, metro, city, and so forth.
You will not see every possible geographic area. While Google shows some neigh-
borhoods, most are not in their system. The most common results you will see are these:
••
Country
••
State/province
••
Nielsen® DMA®
••
Metro
••
City
••
County
••
Airports
••
Postal codes
••
Congressional districts

■  R e ach i ng Users i n Speci f ic Locat ions
371
For each geographic area, you will also see an estimated reach. This may differ 
significantly from the actual population because this is the unique cookie estimate for 
any region. This estimate can also be skewed by multiple cookies for the same user. For 
instance, if the same person has a desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone, Google sees this 
as four unique cookies even though it is one person. Within the search results you have 
several options that we will examine individually.
Add the Location
If you click on the location or click the Add link, that location will be added to your 
list of targeted locations, and a map will be displayed highlighting your target area. 
You can add multiple locations to a single campaign in this fashion (Figure 11.5).
Figure 11.5  Choosing locations
Exclude the Location
There are times you do not want to show an ad to a geographic area. This is common 
if you do not serve an area, do not ship to a location, or have underperformance within 
a region.
If you click the Exclude link, your ad will not be displayed to a region and that 
region will be called out within the interface.
This is useful when you want to select an entire country, but there may be a few 
states you wish to exclude either because you are not licensed there, those areas do 
not perform well, or maybe you are an e-commerce site that ships to everyone in the 
continental United States, but you don’t ship to Hawaii and Alaska. In the e-commerce 
example, you could include the entire United States and exclude Alaska and Hawaii 
(Figure 11.6).

372
Figure 11.6  Excluding Hawaii and Alaska from seeing your U.S.-targeted ads
Your Geographic Ads Will Purposely Be Served to Searchers outside 
Your Region
While you can choose to show ads only to users in a region, Google tries to show ads to users based on 
the area where they want to find information. Therefore, when selecting regions you want to target, 
you are not telling Google you only want to show ads in a region—you are actually informing them 
that you want to display ads to individuals who are searching for information in your target locations.
When a searcher uses an explicit geographic keyword in their search query that falls into the region 
where you want your ads to serve, that searcher can still see your ad. For instance, if you use the key-
word plumber in a campaign that is targeted to only Chicago and a searcher in California searches for 
Chicago plumber, your ad can be displayed.
There are times when a geographic query is ambiguous, such as the Washington example in the 
earlier section, “The Technology behind Location Targeting,” where Google is not confident enough to 
show geographic ads based on the user’s query. However, if Google is confident that the user is look-
ing for information in your geographic targeted areas, your ad can be seen by searchers outside your 
target region who are explicitly searching for information about your keywords and target region. 
There are ways to control this behavior, which will be addressed in the “Advanced Location Targeting 
Options” section.
There are times when you may want to use this feature for organizational pur-
poses so you can showcase different ads based on a user location. For instance, if you 
sell renter’s insurance, you might want to have three different campaigns based on the 

■  R e ach i ng Users i n Speci f ic Locat ions
373
benefits in the ad copy and the landing page you want to send visitors to on your web-
site. Let’s assume these are the goals of your benefit messages in ad copy:
••
Showcase fire insurance benefits in San Diego
••
Showcase earthquake benefits in San Francisco and Los Angeles
••
Showcase a general benefit to the rest of California
In this instance, you would have one campaign that was targeted to California 
and excluded San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Then you would create a 
campaign that was shown to just users in San Diego and another one that targeted San 
Francisco and Los Angeles.
By utilizing a combination of location targeting and excluded regions, you can 
narrow down exactly who will see your ad copy. This strategy is also useful for show-
ing different offers, messages, and benefits in different sections of the same country.
However, one of the most important aspects of writing ads for specific locations 
is to determine if the user is local or nonlocal. Each of those groups has different con-
cerns and knowledge about your area, and therefore you need to engage them in differ-
ent manners.
Search Nearby
Sometimes you will be targeting locations when you are unfamiliar with the geo-
graphic regions near your location. When you want to find other locations near your 
target area, click the Nearby link and you will see additional locations near the loca-
tion you are searching (Figure 11.7).
Figure 11.7  Locations nearby Houston

Chapter 11:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng T ech n iqu e s  ■
374
From this interface, you have the typical options to include, exclude, or find even 
more nearby location data.
Bulk Targeting
If you wish to search for several locations at once, you can use the Bulk Locations 
option. With the bulk targeting feature, you can search for up to 1,000 locations at 
once, and then from the search screen go through the options of adding, excluding, or 
finding nearby locations.
If you are targeting the specific locations of hundreds of stores, or you wish 
to target a large number of zip codes, the bulk targeting option will save you time in 
searching and adding all of those locations.
Radius Targeting
If you would rather reach users around a central point instead of targeting specific 
locations, you can use radius targeting. With radius targeting you can enter an address, 
zip code, or other map point and then choose how far you wish to target around that 
location. To specify a radius, click the link Radius Targeting, and you’ll see the screen 
shown in Figure 11.8.
Figure 11.8  Radius targeting an address
By default, the radius is set to 20 miles. Keep two factors in mind as you choose 
a radius:
••
How far will people travel to visit your business?
••
How far are you willing to travel?
In State College, Pennsylvania, for example, it is not uncommon for searchers to 
drive over an hour to one of the major cities from the rural center of Pennsylvania to 

■  R e ach i ng Users i n Speci f ic Locat ions
375
go shopping or conduct other activities. Choosing a large radius could be a good choice 
for your business if you were targeting a rural area. However, even a five-mile radius 
could be over an hour drive during rush hour in Washington, D.C. Therefore, examine 
how far you travel to your customers or how far your customers travel to you when 
selecting your target radius.
The second factor to keep in mind is that you are often targeting ISP mappings 
and not always someone’s physical location. For instance, Rogers Park is a neighbor-
hood in Chicago consisting of over 60,000 residents. Yet, almost everyone in Rogers 
Park sees ads from Skokie, Evanston, or downtown Chicago. If you were to target 
your ads to only Rogers Park, your ad impressions would be much smaller than actual 
searches for your company from people who live in Rogers Park.
Radius targeting is rarely accurate when you are targeting only one or two 
miles, unless the searcher is on a maps property where they have to enter a specific 
address or they are on a GPS-enabled device. In those cases, radius targeting is highly 
accurate.
Location Groups and Bid Modifiers
Location groups allow you to target locations with specific properties or characteristics 
to them. For instance, you can target airports, central commercial areas, or universities 
(Figure 11.9).
Figure 11.9  Choosing places of interest
You can also target by demographics. At the moment, only household income 
is an option, but it’s likely that Google will add demographic targeting options in the 
coming year.
Finally, you can add or adjust the radius for your location extensions in the 
Location Groups options.
These settings are not meant to be the only location targeting you set for a 
campaign; their true usage comes in the form of bid modifiers, which will be fully 
addressed in Chapter 13, “Devising Profitable Bid Strategies.” Bid modifiers allow you 
to automatically adjust your bid up or down for any chosen location. 

Chapter 11:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng T ech n iqu e s  ■
376
For instance, you might have a bid set at $1. However, your product sells 
mostly to people in higher income brackets. Therefore, you can add each income 
bracket as a location and then set your bid 300 percent higher if someone is in the 
top income bracket, 250 percent higher if they are in the top 20 percent income 
bracket, and so on.
In addition, if you find that the closer someone is to your restaurant, the more 
likely they are to become a customer, you could add your location extension as a 5-mile 
target, a 3-mile target, and a 1-mile target. Then you could adjust your bid to be higher 
the closer someone is to your restaurant.
To set a bid modifier, you must first add a location to your location settings. 
If you only added the United States as a target, then you cannot set a modifier for 
Maryland. If you added each state as a location target, then you can set a modifier for 
each region.
Because bid modifiers can become quite complex, we will address bid modi-
fiers in Chapter 13 and account organization in Chapter 14, “Organizing Accounts 
Successfully.” It is through understanding first how location targeting works (this 
­chapter), how modifiers are used (Chapter 13), and how to organize your account 
(Chapter 14) that you can construct the proper account and use locations and bid 
modifiers properly.
Advanced Location Targeting Options
The restaurant Chicago Pizza is my favorite place to order Chicago-style pizza. 
While their pizza is great, they suffer from a large problem when trying to advertise 
with AdWords. Google sees someone from Seattle searching for Chicago Pizza and 
assumes the user wants to see pizza restaurants in Chicago. In fact, that user prob-
ably wants to learn how to make Chicago-style pizzas or what that pizza type even 
is; however, Chicago Pizza ads appear by default because the geography is part of 
the company name.
The advanced location targeting options can solve these issues. By default 
Google examines location by these two factors:
••
Physical location (IP address and other signals)
••
Search query intent (Chicago pizza)
The advanced options allow you to adjust these default settings. To adjust the 
default options, open the Advanced Location Options (Figure 11.10) and change the 
default settings.
The option “People in, searching for, or viewing pages about my targeted loca-
tion (recommended)” will target your ads based on the user being in your targeted area 
or searching for your location in their query.

■  R e ach i ng Users i n Speci f ic Locat ions

Figure 11.10  Changing the location targeting method
The option “People in my targeted location” will show your ads only to those 
who Google believes are in your targeted area regardless of geographies used in the 
search query.
The last option, “People searching for or viewing pages about my targeted loca-
tion,” will show your ad to those who use your geography in their search query.
In our example for Chicago Pizza, they would want to utilize the option “People 
in my targeted location” so that their ads are only shown to people in Chicago who 
search for Chicago pizza and not to people in other areas of the country who search for 
Chicago pizza.
If you are a hotel in Seattle, you might not want someone in Seattle who types in 
hotel to see your ad—you want nonlocals to see your ads. Therefore, you can exclude 
users based on physical location or search intent as well (Figure 11.11).
Figure 11.11  Excluding users based on location or search intent
In the case of a hotel, what you might do is create two campaigns. One cam-
paign excludes users based on search intent so that your ads will be seen only by 
people in your local region. Since these ads are targeting locals, you can run ads that 
are targeted to locals looking for a getaway, hosting a meeting, or wanting to rent the 
ballroom for a prom. The second campaign will exclude based on physical location and 
target only travelers looking to book a room in your hotel.
If you are having problems reaching the correct people based on location or 
search query signals, the advanced options can help you ensure that only the correct 
audience is seeing your ads.
So far, you have learned how to target or exclude users. Beyond just targeting 
users, there are some specific items you should think about when targeting various 
regions.

Location Targeting Considerations
Although you can reach users from an area as small as one mile around an address to 
almost every country in the world, there are some things you should consider before 
choosing your location targeting options.
Targeting Multiple Countries
You can easily add multiple countries at once with the search and add functionality 
of the location targeting tool. However, it is rarely a good choice to show the same ad 
to multiple countries at the same time for a variety of reasons, which I will explain in 
some detail.
It is common to see advertisers choose United Kingdom, New Zealand, 
Australia, Canada, and United States in a single campaign because all these countries 
speak English. However, that thinking can lead to problems down the road.
For example, if you choose these five countries, how do you spell a word such 
as color? It is spelled colour in some countries and color in others. While the basics of 
English are the same in most English-speaking countries, there are many colloquial-
isms, slang, and local customs that can cause a breakdown in communication even 
though the “correct” words are being used.
There are many words that not only have different spellings by country but 
have different meanings as well. For instance, the word currar is a Spanish word that 
means “to work” when used in Spain. However, in Argentina that same word means 
“defraud.”
Country-Based Optimization
If you group all your countries into a single campaign, what is the next step to optimi-
zation? If you learn that the stats for your countries look like those in Table 11.1, what 
would you do next?
▶
▶Table 11.1  Statistics for multiple countries
Country
Click-Through Rate
Conversion Rate

10%
1%
United Kingdom

In this case, you are receiving traffic in the United States, but the ad and landing 
page are not converting; therefore, you would want to choose a different combination 
to show to your visitors. However, in the United Kingdom you are converting quite 
well but your ad is not being clicked on very often, so you might want to test different 
ad copy to increase the click-through rate.

■  Locat ion Ta rget i ng Consi der at ions
379
Since you have chosen all of your ads to be shown in these different countries 
in the same campaign, you would not be able to accomplish these changes in the same 
campaign. Therefore, the first step would be to duplicate the entire campaign and 
change the location targeting options for each campaign to show to the appropriate 
countries. If you advertise in only a handful of countries, it is useful to limit yourself to 
one country per campaign.
When to Ignore the One Country per Campaign Rule
Multinational companies may want to disregard this rule due to the number of coun-
tries they have to run ads for with limited staff or time to manage the campaigns. You 
always have to balance best practices with time and staff management.
In these cases, it can be useful to include many countries at once and then orga-
nize your campaigns around the languages that you are targeting. For instance, several 
African countries list French, English, Arabic, and Portuguese as official languages. 
Therefore, if you wanted to target all of Africa the same due to time constraints, you 
could create one campaign per language with each campaign targeting the entire con-
tinent. This is not a bad idea, but sometimes you have to make compromises based on 
resource constraints.
Even if you are a multinational company that can serve multiple countries at 
once, if you do not have a large budget to effectively penetrate every single country you 
serve, it can be better to concentrate your budget on a small list of countries.
If your multinational company’s goal is to advertise to searchers who have a high 
chance of converting, choose a handful of countries you do well in and limit your ads 
to show only in those few countries. Once you have effectively penetrated the market-
place and are seeing returns on your ad spend, expand your list of countries.
If your multinational company’s goal is to penetrate new markets, selectively 
choose those new markets, reach your goals in those markets, and then move on to the 
next set of countries you want to learn more about your products.
For multinational companies, if you have a small budget and try to reach every 
single country, you will often fail at your objectives—you cannot be everything to 
everybody. Therefore, choose your country list wisely based on your marketing goals. 
Once you reach those goals, you should have higher revenues and can increase your 
budget as you expand your reach to new countries.
For most accounts, limiting yourself to one country per campaign will help you 
write better ad copy and allow you to send your visitors to country-specific pages in 
your website. This combination will lead to a better user experiences, and in turn, bet-
ter user experiences result in higher conversion rates.

Reaching Users in an Area Smaller than a Country
If you choose to advertise in an area smaller than a country, there are a few consider-
ations for both your keywords and your campaign setup.
Using Geographic Keywords
First, if you use geographic keywords (such as San Jose plumber) in a campaign that 
is targeting a small area, you will often receive very little traffic because the user will 
have to be in the area and use those geographic keywords in their search query.
Please note, if you have a very small budget, this can actually be useful since 
users who use geographic words in their queries often convert better than those who 
do not use such words. However, for most accounts, using geographic words in a cam-
paign targeted to a small region will often receive very few impressions.
When you use geographic keywords, you have two options for how you want to 
set your targeting. The first option is to target the country. This will ensure that any-
one in the country who uses those keywords will see your ad. However, for companies 
trying to reach only local traffic, since there are often city names that occur in mul-
tiple states as well as some users who will not be near your business that will trigger 
your ads, conversion rates will often be a little lower than for someone who selected 
a smaller area. This is the balance between total conversions and conversion rate; 
often the more conversions you want, the lower the conversion rate becomes in some 
instances.
For national companies that are using geographic targeting as a means of show-
ing localized ads and landing pages, it is okay to select the entire country. The reasons 
for choosing smaller areas are for when you want only local traffic.
For local businesses, if you want less traffic but higher conversion rates, then the 
second option is to choose a geographic area that is one or two levels larger than the 
geographic keywords you are using. For instance, if your keyword was a city, such as 
Miami plumber, then you could target the entire state of Florida. If you were using the 
keyword Evanston plumber (Evanston being a city inside the Chicago metro), then you 
could choose either the metro of Chicago or the state of Illinois.
For state-based keywords, such as Illinois insurance, it is usually best to target 
a country because there are not predefined geographic areas that sit between the state 
and country level.
Based on how budgets usually occur for businesses by size, in general it is best 
for local companies that employ geographic keywords to use either a metro or a state 
as their regional targets. For national companies, it is usually best to choose the entire 
country.
Geographic search queries usually have lower volume than their generic coun-
terparts in the same region. For instance, there are more people in Miami who search 

■  Locat ion Ta rget i ng Consi der at ions
381
for plumber than there are in Miami who search for Miami plumber. Therefore, geo-
graphic keyword campaigns are great for national companies that are localizing their 
traffic or for local businesses that want to ensure their traffic is highly qualified, but 
if you want to reach the most users, then you can use keywords that do not have geo-
graphic qualifiers on them.
Using Non-Geographic-Based Keywords
If you are a local business and you want a simple setup, then you can just pick your 
keywords without any geographic modifiers and set your location targeting at the level 
that makes sense for your company (often city, metro, or state).
If you are a national business and you do not wish to localize your traffic, then 
you can pick your keywords as normal and set your targeting to the entire country.
There are times you will want to use both campaign types at once to ensure that 
everyone can see your ad.
Using Multiple Campaigns to Reach All Searchers
Google is excellent at detecting the searcher’s country of origin. However, there are 
many times when a searcher’s location cannot be discerned, such as those listed in the 
earlier section “How Accurate Is Location Targeting?” In these cases, your geographic 
ads will not be displayed to these users. Therefore, if you want to make sure every 
searcher looking for your services sees your ad, use two campaigns.
The benefits of using a second campaign vary by location. When you are reach-
ing a large area where there is less ISP mapping confusion by location, the benefits may 
be minimal. If you are reaching areas where IP targeting is not very accurate—which 
is much more common outside of the United States—using two campaigns can be quite 
useful. To reach everyone possible, you will want both an IP campaign and a GEO 
campaign:
IP Campaign  This campaign is named after the IP detection technology used to detect a 
user’s location. In this campaign, choose the location targeting of the area where you 
want to show your ads and do not use geographic keywords.
GEO Campaign  This campaign will contain all geographically qualified keywords. In this 
campaign, choose your ads to be shown to an area larger than your target market, as 
discussed in the “Using Geographic Keywords” section, and then every keyword you 
use will have a geographic qualifier attached to it.
For instance, if you were an accounting service that was trying to reach search-
ers in Dallas, you would use the campaign structure shown in Table 11.2 to make sure 
the maximum number of searchers could find your ad.

If you are constrained by time or budget and want to use only one campaign, 
keep in mind that most accounts will have more total impressions from an IP campaign 
than from a GEO campaign. However, many accounts find that their conversion rates 
are higher in their GEO campaign. Therefore, if you can have only one campaign to 
reach your target geography, choose based on your goals: more total searches or a 
higher conversion rate. When you want to reach all the searchers possible, using a com-
bination of both GEO and IP campaigns will maximize your exposure.
Are Your Visitors Traveling Long Distances to Reach Your Business?
If your customers search with geographically qualified queries to find your business, do not rely on IP 
campaigns to reach your customers. For instance, searchers looking for hotels are rarely in the local 
area. Most searchers looking for hotels are searching for a city name and a hotel-based keyword, such 
as San Francisco hotel. While Google attempts to discern if there is a local intent in the search query to 
show IP targeted ads, you should take greater control of your ad serving by using geographically quali-
fied queries as keywords in your account.
You can still run two different campaigns to reach all the users searching for your hotel; however, in 
this case if you wanted to run only a single campaign, you would reach more qualified users by using a 
GEO campaign instead of an IP campaign.
The Most Popular Geographic Keywords
In GEO campaigns, you will want to use geographic qualified keywords. Most 
accounts will not use every possible geographic keyword. Based on the area you want 
to reach, choose the ones most applicable to your campaign’s geo-targeting goals.
State Names  When reaching all users in a state, use the state name as a keyword quali-
fier. Some common examples are California car insurance and Alabama BMW 
dealership.
State Abbreviations  The longer the state name, the more common it is to see search-
ers use the state abbreviation instead of the full state name. Keywords such as NJ 
car insurance quote or AZ golf courses are common searches. However, be careful 
when automating these abbreviations. Oregon’s abbreviation is OR, which is such a 

■  Locat ion Ta rget i ng Consi der at ions
383
common word that Google often ignores it and often does not consider it a state-based 
search. It is common to see ads for plumber MD. While plumber doctors are not com-
mon businesses, MD is the abbreviation for Maryland. Maine is such a short state 
name that the residents rarely search for plumber ME, which is a good thing, because 
their abbreviation ME could be mistaken as the common use of the word and not as a 
state abbreviation.
Geographic Keyword Tools
While the sheer amount of names can seem overwhelming, you do not have to do this manu-
ally. There are tools where you can input a zip code, radius, state, country, and so forth and 
receive geographic reference points that correspond to your inputs. My favorite geographic 
keyword tool is the Geographic Keyword Finder Tool from CertifiedKnowledge.org. Find it 
here: http://certifiedknowledge.org/membership-information/ppc-tools/
geographic-keyword-finder-tool/.
County Names  Some states, such as Ohio, identify greatly with their local counties. Other 
states see very little search volume for county names. If you are licensed in a county 
or see a decent search volume for your local county, then use it as a keyword, such as 
Orange County contractor.
There are times when a geographic name is used in many locations. For instance, 
Orange County, California, is near Los Angeles and home to Disneyland. Visitors to 
Disney World have passed through Orange County, Florida. There are several Orange 
Counties in the United States. When your geographic area’s name, whether it is a 
county, city, or other area, is the same in multiple locations, then use your ad copy to 
identify which location you serve.
While the electrician in Orange County, California, and the electrician in Orange 
County, Texas, are competing for impressions on the keyword Orange Country electri-
cian, they are not competing for the clicks. The electrician in California does not want 
the users from Texas clicking on his ad. By adding the state abbreviation or some other 
geographic qualified keyword, such as the city name, the ad will inform the users of the 
actual area you serve. Santa Ana is the county seat of Orange Country, California. In 
this example, the ad copy “Orange County TX plumber” or “Santa Ana plumber” will 
help differentiate your ad from the other ads targeting Orange Counties in other states.
The other option is to target only the state and not the country in your location set-
tings, and therefore the searchers who use those confusing geographic keywords should 
not see your ads.
City or Metro Names  Some of the most common geographic keywords are city and metro 
names. Los Angeles museums, Orlando resorts, and Seattle travel agents are good 

Chapter 11:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng T ech n iqu e s  ■
384
examples of using a city name as a keyword. There are also a handful of cities where 
the city abbreviations are worth considering; NYC for New York City and LA for Los 
Angeles are the most common U.S. examples.
Zip Codes and Area Codes  72113 plumber is searched for by those looking for a plumber in 
Maumelle, Arkansas. Zip codes are hyper-local queries that generally have low search 
volume but highly targeted consumers. Area codes can also be used to designate a very 
specific local search.
When using area codes or zip codes as keyword qualifiers, do not utilize broad match. 
Google does not always realize that 60606 is different than 60406, yet anyone who 
lives in Chicago will tell you that one is in south Chicago and the other in north 
Chicago. Plumbers rarely serve both of those areas because it can take well over an 
hour, depending on traffic, to go from one zip code to the other.
Neighborhoods  Some larger cities, such as Chicago, have many residents who identify with 
their neighborhood and use their neighborhood names as geographic qualifiers in their 
search results. The search Rogers Park apartments and other closely related keywords was 
conducted roughly 1,100 times a month throughout 2013. While that is not a high search 
volume, these search queries have an explicit geographic intent. If you rent apartments 
in Rogers Park, it is a keyword you should use. Searching by neighborhood names is not 
common in smaller cities; however, it is always worth examining the areas you are reach-
ing to see if the consumers in your target market search with their neighborhood terms.
Airport Codes  Many frequent travelers have been stuck in a city overnight due to the 
weather. Their first search is usually for the airport code and the word hotel followed 
by the airport code or restaurant. For instance, LAX is the abbreviation for the Los 
Angeles Airport. The search query LAX hotel is often searched more than 74,000 
times a month.
There are instances where searchers have used SFO iPod headphones and gone shop-
ping during a long layover. If you are near an airport, test using the airport codes as 
qualifiers. For example, if you were at the Hilton hotel located in the Chicago O’Hare 
airport, ORD Hilton and ORD hotel would be excellent keywords. In the LAX 
example, the query LAX sushi is searched a few hundred times each month. While 
the search volume is small, that is an explicit query. The more explicit the query, the 
greater the likelihood that conversion rates will be high.
If you serve the airport in some unique fashion, such as a taxi or limousine company, 
for instance, you should use airport codes as geo-qualifiers to your usual keywords.
Regional Lingo  Every area has ways its residents describe themselves that are not official 
designations. Some of these words have high search volume, because that is how the 
locals think about their geographic area.
For instance, downtown Chicago is called the Loop. The query loop restaurant fre-
quently breaks 10,000 searches a month, while loop hotel often breaks 27,000 monthly 

■  T r e at i ng Loca l s a n d Non loca l s Di f f er en t ly i n You r A d Copy
385
searches on Google. Since the word loop could describe multiple places, such as the 
Loop Restaurant in Minneapolis, adding ad copy such as “Serving Chicago’s West 
Loop” can help weed out searchers looking for a different service.
While regional lingo can provide good geographic keywords, it is also excellent to use 
in ad copy. Using the local lexicon in your ad copy helps identify your company as 
understanding the local area and can often increase your click-through rate. Ad copy 
such as “Sushi Delivery in the Loop” or “Located in the Water Tower Place” instantly 
tells the searcher your location or delivery area, and it can help prequalify searchers 
who click on your ads.
However, always be careful when using regional lingo. Chicago is known as the Windy 
City. That term refers to Chicago politics, not the wind blowing off Lake Michigan. 
When a local hears someone refer to Chicago as the Windy City, they usually assume 
the person is not from Chicago.
Beyond targeting users with keywords or putting geographies in the ad copy, you 
should think back to the actual person. Are they a local or a nonlocal? One of the most 
important aspects of writing ads for specific locations is to key in on the user’s knowl-
edge of the area. Each of these groups has different concerns and informational needs 
about your area, and therefore you must engage them in different manners.
Treating Locals and Nonlocals Differently in Your Ad Copy
A local is someone familiar with the location you are targeting. They have an under-
standing of the region, landmarks, and culture. A nonlocal is someone who has limited 
knowledge about your location and therefore needs a different set of information than 
a local. Let’s examine a few ways to treat these two audiences differently:
Geographic Descriptions  A local searcher knows the area you serve. They want to know if 
you serve their actual location. Therefore, when a local searches for Chicago plumber 
they want to know if the plumber will come to their house. Using descriptors such as 
“Serving North Chicago” or “Located in the heart of the Triangle” tells a local exactly 
where you are or where you service.
A nonlocal may not have enough information about the area to understand the loca-
tions in the preceding ad copy. They are looking for blunt descriptors such as “New 
York City hotel” or “Downtown Pittsburgh hotel.” When using geographic descriptors 
in ad copy for nonlocals, rarely should you use regional lingo. Reassure the searcher 
that you serve the location where they are searching for information.
Where Are You Located?  A local will look for precise information. What building is your 
office located in? How long does it take to drive to your store? Using ad copy such as 
“Near Rush Street,” “Located in the Water Tower Place,” or “Rogers Park Real Estate 
Specialists” gives a local exact information.

Chapter 11:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng T ech n iqu e s  ■
386
However, a nonlocal will be confused by much of that language. A nonlocal wants to 
know if you can even serve their needs. A traveler wants to know general information 
such as how far you are from shopping, if you are near the airport, or if you are close 
to downtown.
Rush Street and Michigan Avenue are both in the heart of the Chicago shopping dis-
trict. A local knows that fact. Therefore, “On Rush Street” tells a local more precise 
information than “In the Shopping District.” However, a nonlocal may not know that 
fact about Rush Street; therefore, the more general ad copy “Located in the Shopping 
District” is better nonlocal ad copy.
Engaging the Searcher  Once someone has clicked on your ad, your landing page needs to 
continue to engage the searcher based on their knowledge of the local area. A local will 
look for driving directions, phone numbers, maps, and detailed business information 
on your website. If you are a delivery company, show a map that highlights the areas 
you deliver to so the person can quickly see if you serve their area.
Conversely, if you are a hotel catering to nonlocals, showing a map of the area with 
your location, the airport, the shopping district, or the nearest amusement park will let 
them understand how far you are from those various items that maybe related to the 
purpose of their trip.
Conversion Activities  Since locals know precise information about your area, they often 
jump to items such as driving directions, online delivery ordering, or in-store pickup 
once they realize you can serve their needs.
However, nonlocals rarely have enough information to make that quick a decision. It 
is common for a nonlocal to make a phone call or send an email looking for a specific 
piece of information before finishing any conversion processes you have. Take note of 
the most common questions you receive so you can put those as pieces of information 
on your landing page to help a nonlocal make a quicker decision.
Rarely are locals and nonlocals looking for the same information. Think 
through what someone who knows your local area would want to find. If you are an 
actual store, it’s most likely driving directions or a phone number. If you are a pizza 
delivery company, it is most likely delivery area and online ordering or a phone number 
to order over the phone.
For nonlocals, you may need to give out as much information about the local 
area, such as shopping opportunities or the local amusement park, as you do about 
your actual business. By thinking through the differences between these two groups 
of individuals, you can write better ads and send the searcher to appropriate landing 
pages that can answer their questions so they can take the next step of doing business 
with your company.
If you use regional targeting, your ad could show a fifth line of ad text denoting 
the region your ads are targeted to. This is good for locals and excellent for nonlocals.

However, there is a way to put an actual address below your ad copy using location 
extensions.
Automatically Inserting Your Address into the Ad Copy
The location extension allows you to add additional information about your business 
location to your ad copy. This is another ad extension similar to those discussed in 
Chapter 4, “Writing Compelling Ads,” except this extension is available only if you 
want to showcase your business location to a user.
To access the location extension, navigate to the Ad Extensions tab and choose 
the Location Extensions options (Figure 11.12).
Figure 11.12  Location Extensions options
From this interface, you can view all your location extensions or add new ones. 
There are two ways of adding location extensions. The easiest way to accomplish this is 
to link your AdWords account with your Places for Business account. Expand the sec-
tion under Addresses From Places for Business and enter your account credentials. This 
will automatically link your AdWords account to your Places for Business account so 
that your locations can show in your ad copy (Figure 11.13).
Figure 11.13  Connecting your Places for Business account

Chapter 11:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng T ech n iqu e s  ■
388
Location extensions can be enabled at the account, campaign, or ad group level. 
If you want to use the same extension across your entire account, you can make the 
extension at the account level and you are finished. If you have multiple businesses and 
want to show different business locations for each campaign or ad group, then you will 
need to create multiple extensions.
Places for Business Accounts
All businesses should claim their Places for Business account. This lets you control your business information 
that is displayed on Google maps and ensures the information is accurate. Navigate to www.google.com/
local/add/ and walk through Google’s wizard to create your account and enter or edit your business 
information. If you have several locations, use the bulk upload feature to add all your businesses at once. 
After you have created an account, you will be able to see statistics on how often your information was 
viewed and the number of actions that occurred with your listings. Please note, this has been called the 
Local Business Center and Places for Business in the past, so if you have created either of those accounts, 
you already have a Places for Business account.
At the moment, there are two types of location extensions that are left over 
from the Enhanced Campaign upgrade from the summer of 2013. The first is upgraded 
location extensions. With the upgraded extension, you must connect your AdWords 
account to a Places for Business account before the locations will show in your ads. 
The advantage of this extension is that you can choose for it to be displayed on mobile, 
desktop, or all devices. The second advantage is that you can create the extension at 
the account or ad group level.
The second location extension is the non-upgraded extension. With this exten-
sion, it can be enabled only at the campaign level; however, it has one advantage 
over the upgraded extension in that you can manually enter your business address 
(Figure 11.14) since it does not have to be connected to a Places for Business account. 
This is very useful when you are advertising for a location you do not own. For 
instance, if you are holding an event at a conference center or hotel, you may not own 
the venue but you still want to advertise the location. Therefore, adding addresses man-
ually can be useful to promote the location of the event.
Once you have saved addresses in your campaign settings, Google will display 
your address in the text ads on Google.com (Figure 11.15) when Google determines 
that your address will help the searcher find the information they are seeking. Your 
address will almost always show on Google Local properties like maps.google.com.

If you have multiple addresses in the same campaign, each ad could be shown 
with any of your addresses. Generally, Google will display the address that is nearest 
the searcher. If you want to limit an ad to display only one address with an ad, you 
need to use the filtering option for the location extension (Figure 11.16) and use only 
one address per campaign.

Using location extensions will help your business connect with searchers on 
Google.com by showing the additional address and giving the consumer more informa-
tion about your business. However, location extensions really shine when your ads are 
shown on Google Maps. Creating a robust Google Places page will help your business 
stand out from the competition and can dramatically increase your presence on local 
properties.
A Case Study into Local Belief Systems
Local residents usually respect and defend their cities. One does not walk on stage in 
Boston and disparage the legacy of the Boston Celtics. Each area also has different 
beliefs and uses different criteria to determine whether information is credible.
These beliefs carry over into response rates for advertising. It is not uncommon 
to show the same ad in two different geographies and find two very different click-
through rates or conversion rates. I’m going to walk through a study I did with a com-
pany that serves ads in the northeast United States.
This company has several locations throughout multiple states. Since they were 
trying to drive awareness of their new locations and attempting to drive foot traffic 
into their buildings, the main goal was to bring qualified visitors to their website so 
they could showcase how easy it was for anyone in the northeast to find one of their 
locations. They wanted to show that same ease in the ad copy as well as create a syn-
ergy between the ad copy and the landing page.
The headline, description line 1, and display URL of these ads were identical. 
The only difference was description line 2. The two lines were
••
Locations throughout the state
••
Convenient locations near you
Both of those lines of ad copy talk about multiple locations, but the difference 
in response rates between Pennsylvania and New Jersey (two states that border each 
other) was stunning (Table 11.3).
▶

New Jersey is a state where most people, except for commuters, do not drive from 
the north side of the state to the south side of the state on a regular basis, even though it 
takes less than three hours to do so. Therefore, the ad copy “Locations throughout the 

■  V i ew i ng Geogr a ph ic R e su lts
391
state” did not do well. New Jersey is a state of convenience. The adage “If it’s more than 
15 minutes away, it doesn’t exist” can be used to explain much of the state’s behavior. 
Hence, the ad copy that used the word convenient did well in the state.
The middle of Pennsylvania is rural. Consumers often drive an hour or more to 
shop at the outlet malls. It is not uncommon to see someone from State College, which 
is in the middle of the state, drive to Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, or the Poconos to do 
their shopping. All of those options take more than an hour of driving time. Overall, 
people in the middle of the state do not believe the word convenient applies to them. 
Therefore, outside of Philadelphia, the ad copy using the word convenient did poorly. 
However, telling people in Pennsylvania the truth—we’re not close, but we are all over 
the state—increased response rates.
Philadelphia, one of the largest cities in the United States, was the exception 
in Pennsylvania. It is common to see residents of large cities behave differently from 
people who live in rural areas. The CTR difference between Philadelphia and the rest 
of Pennsylvania highlights these differences.
If this were your account, you would want to divide your targeting into four 
campaigns:
••
The first campaign would target only New Jersey with the “convenient” ad copy.
••
The second campaign would target Pennsylvania and use the excluded regions 
feature so consumers in Philadelphia do not see the ad. This campaign would 
use the “Locations throughout the state” ad copy.
••
The third campaign would target only Philadelphia with the “convenient” ad 
copy and test a few other variations of ads to see what else resonated in this city.
••
The fourth campaign would utilize geographic keywords. This campaign would 
have a large number of ad groups that all use the geographic modifiers, such as 
New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Allentown, Trenton, and Philadelphia.
The difference in belief systems by geography is one of the reasons you see dif-
ferent billboards and TV commercials from national companies in different locations. 
Each area has different cultural norms. If no one believes your ads, the ads will not get 
clicked and you will not receive conversions from those searchers.
Viewing Geographic Results
When you start adding multiple addresses or showing your ads in a variety of geogra-
phies, it can be difficult to see your ads and the local competition because you might 
not live in all of your target markets. Google provides a nice tool that allows you to see 
ads in various locations.
Navigate to https://adwords.google.com/d/AdPreview/. At the top of the page you 
can enter specific criteria to preview ads (as shown in Figure 11.17) if you are logged 
into your AdWords account:

Chapter 11:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng T ech n iqu e s  ■
392
Figure 11.17  Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool
This tool has several options that you can utilize to preview ads:
••
Keyword
••
Google domain (Google.com, Google.co.uk)
••
Language
••
Location
••
Device
••
Operating system (for mobile and tablets only)
••
Carrier or Wi-Fi (for mobile and tablets only
Once you fill out the information, you can preview what a user who is conduct-
ing a search at that moment in time would see in that target geography. This is an 
important caveat: at that moment in time. If your daily budget is exhausted for the day, 
your ad will not show up on Google.com, and therefore it will also not show up in the 
Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool.
If you want to see what someone who lives in Alpine, Arizona, would see when 
conducting a search for electrician on Google.com in English, using an Android phone, 
then enter the information into the tool. The bottom of the preview page will reload 
with your search results (Figure 11.18).
You should always use this tool when searching for your own ads, because if 
you conduct searches on Google for your ad and then never click on them, it appears to 
Google that your ads are not relevant to you as a searcher. When this happens, Google 
may stop showing your ads to you when you conduct searches, or you may see the ad 
in different positions than one-time searchers would see. When your ad is displayed on 
the ad preview page, it does not count as an impression or affect the statistics in your 
account in any manner.

Geographic Performance Reports
AdWords offers geographic performance data, which will give you statistics broken 
down by geographic region. For instance, you can see the cost per click, click-through 
rate, conversion rate, and cost per conversion by geographic region (Figure 11.19).
Figure 11.19  Geographic performance data
In Chapter 16, “AdWords Reports: Extracting Actionable Information,” I will 
take a detailed look at reports and extracting data out of AdWords in order to opti-
mize accounts. Please note that with the geographic data, you can customize this data 
by country, region (state or province), metro area, and city (Figure 11.20).

Chapter 11:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng T ech n iqu e s  ■
394
Figure 11.20  Customizing geographic data
One good use of this report is to find areas where you are not performing well. 
If you are targeting the entire United States and find that only 1 percent of your conver-
sions are coming from New York City, yet that metro area is roughly 15.6 percent of 
the entire U.S. population, then you are not fully taking advantage of the region.
You may find there is more competition in New York City for your services and 
that your ads are on page 2 or 3, and to receive more exposure you need to raise your 
bids in just that area. Or you may find that you are receiving the visitors, but your con-
version rate there is much lower than in other areas.
In this case, you might want to create a new campaign that is targeted to just 
New York City, where you can showcase a different offer and bid separately from the 
rest of the United States. You should also exclude New York City from showing ads in 
your original campaign that is targeted to the entire country.
An easy way of working with this report is to use Excel pivot tables, as discussed 
in Chapter 7, “Demystifying Quality Score.” If you examine your data by geographic 
region, you can see conversions, conversion rate, and other data points by individual 
region (Figure 11.21).
One of the quality score factors for search is your click-through rate in a geo-
graphic region. If your ads have a high CTR in Seattle and a low CTR in Phoenix, your 
ads will be shown more in Seattle due to a higher CTR in that region. The geographic 
performance report will allow you to see CTR by geographic area (Figure 11.22).

■  Geogr a ph ic Per for m a nce R eports

Figure 11.21  Geographic data in a pivot table
Figure 11.22  Examining CTR and spend by region
It is useful to layer other statistics with CTR to see where you want to spend 
your time optimizing an account. For instance, this account has only spent $0.60 in 
Arta. Regardless of CTR, this probably is not a place to spend your time, especially 
when combined with the knowledge that Arta is a city in Greece with a population of 
23,000. This account’s overall CTR is 14.62 percent. However, in Baja, California, 
the CTR is 3.11 percent. In Attiki, Greece, the CTR is only 1.54 percent. Since both of 
those locations have more than 3 million residents and have higher spends than many 
other locations, optimizing the ads for those locations would be a more appropriate 
place to spend your time.

Chapter 11:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng T ech n iqu e s  ■
396
When optimizing local ads, the first step is to use Google’s Ad Preview and 
Diagnosis tool and see if the ad is blending into the others in that region. If the ad does 
stand out, it could be that the locals just do not respond to your current ad copy. If you 
wanted to reach Attiki differently than the other regions where the ad is shown, you 
could create a different campaign for just Attiki.
The geographic performance report allows you to examine your statistics for 
each region where your ad has been shown. When combined with location targeting, 
you can optimize your account by geographies to make sure searchers are responding 
to your ads in every area where you want to reach consumers.
This data is also used for bid modifiers, which will be discussed in Chapter 13. 
In addition, this data is based on your targeting options, not the actual user’s location. 
To determine the actual user’s location and statistics, you need to examine another 
report in the dimensions tab, called user locations (Figure 11.23).
Figure 11.23  User locations
This report is useful in determining if you want to change your advanced loca-
tion settings to show ads only to a certain region. For instance, if you are a hotel in 
New York City, and users from Paris are converting, then you want to make sure that 
you do not limit your ads not to be shown to these users.
However, if you are a local business and you find that users from faraway places 
are searching for your business and are not converting, then you should change your 
advanced location settings to ensure that your ads are not shown to those users.
Best Practices for Geographic Targeting
The first step in location targeting is to understand where your target market lives and 
then make sure you are targeting those users appropriately. The second step is to ensure 
that your ads are being received properly in the various geographic regions and to then 

■  Be st Pr ac t ice s for Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng
397
adjust your ads and location targeting properly. By following the best practices in this 
chapter, you should be able to accomplish those two concepts in an effective manner.
••
Define where your users are located. Then ensure that your ads are being shown 
only to the appropriate users.
••
You should try to limit your exposure to a maximum of one country per cam-
paign. This will allow you to create more targeted ads and send users to more 
specific landing pages.
••
Use a combination of location targeting and excluded regions to organize your 
campaigns and to make sure you are reaching your target locations.
••
Since much of the technology behind geo-targeting is based on a user’s host provid-
er’s address, the smaller the area you target, the more people you will miss. It can 
be useful to target a larger area than you serve to reach more potential prospects 
and then use ad copy descriptors to let searchers know exactly the areas you serve.
••
Geo-qualifiers are useful as both keywords and in ad copy. Here are a few 
guidelines:
••
Be careful when using state abbreviations as keywords. Some state’s abbre-
viations, such as Maine (ME), Oregon (OR), and Maryland (MD), have 
alternate meanings.
••
When two areas share the same name, use a metro, state, or regional quali-
fier in the ad copy to let the searchers know which area you serve.
••
When using zip codes, do not use broad match; always use phrase or exact 
match.
••
Using regional lingo both as keywords and in ad copy will help you connect 
with local searchers.
••
Understand whether your target market comprises locals or nonlocals so you 
can write ads and use landing pages based on their knowledge of your area.
••
Nonlocals need to be reassured that you can serve their needs and that you 
are in the area where they are searching for information.
••
Locals want precise information such as address and driving directions.
••
Examine the local belief systems to make sure consumers consider your 
offers credible.
••
If you have a physical business or are advertising a specific location, the location 
extension will let customers know exactly where you are located.
••
Always use the Google Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool when searching for your 
own ads so it will not count in your account’s statistics. The tool should be your 
first step when researching local competition for your ads.
••
Geographic data will give you performance insights in the various locations 
where your ads were shown. Use these metrics to optimize your account.

Chapter 11:  U t i li zi ng A dva nced Geogr a ph ic Ta rget i ng T ech n iqu e s  ■
398
By following these best practices, you should be able to target your ads to the 
locations that house your target market. Then write ad copy that engages users based 
on their knowledge of the area. Finally, run reports that will show you if you are being 
successful and reveal areas where you can improve.
These past few chapters have been about reaching your audience through location 
targeting and the display network. Many of these best practices can be time consuming 
when you use the AdWords online interface. In the next chapter, I will introduce the 
AdWords Editor, which will speed up how quickly you can make account changes. I will 
also walk through methods to scale your account in a quick yet efficient manner.

Saving Time and 
Scaling Accounts with 
AdWords Editor
AdWords Editor is a free downloadable desktop 
program offered by Google that allows you to 
manage your AdWords account on your com-
puter instead of using Google’s online interface. 
Learning how to use AdWords Editor can save 
you tremendous amounts of time.
AdWords Editor also supports the bulk 
importing of ad copy and keywords. Combining 
the editor with Microsoft Excel can help you 
scale your account to house thousands of pieces 
of ad copy with tens of thousands of keywords.
In this chapter you will learn how to define 
and organize your ad groups offline so that you 
can still use best practice management even with 
extremely large accounts.

AdWords Editor Overview
Google’s AdWords Editor makes it easy to manage your account. You can add, remove, 
or pause keywords, ad copy, ad groups, or campaigns from a single interface. You can 
see your statistics, Quality Score, first page bids, and other metrics within this pro-
gram. You can make the vast majority of changes to your account within this editor. 
This should be the program you use to optimize your account. Since the editor sits on 
your computer and not on the Web, you can work on your account quickly instead of 
waiting for the AdWords interface to load.
Once you download your account into the editor and start making changes, 
those changes do not go live immediately—they remain offline until you decide to 
upload them. You can make any number of changes to your campaigns and then post 
them online when you are satisfied with the adjustments. Once you post the changes, 
they will go live within your AdWords account instantly.
Although most of the options available through the AdWords online interface 
are also in the editor, a handful of more advanced options are not available there. 
However, AdWords Editor does have capabilities such as import and export that are 
not available in the online interface. Whenever you need to make bulk changes to your 
account, you can save yourself a significant amount of time by using the editor instead 
of the online interface.
I will walk through the interface and basic functionalities of the editor and then 
look at some tricks to save you time and headaches.
To download the editor, you can go to www.google.com/intl/en/adwordseditor/. 
Or choose the Tools menu in your AdWords account and click the AdWords Editor 
link, which will take you to this web page.
When new features are added to the interface that can easily be added to the 
editor, they usually appear in the next release of the editor. When you open AdWords 
Editor, it will automatically check for new versions and prompt you to download a newer 
version if one exists. The editor is available for both Windows and Mac computers.
Choosing Your Viewpoint
The layout of AdWords Editor is similar to the interface that Google launched in the 
summer of 2012, which is the last major change to the interface as of this writing. You 
can choose how much data and the type of data you want to view and have access to 
several tools. Figure 12.1 shows what the editor looks like in its entirety.
Please note that the editor shows so much data about an account that I cannot 
use a client’s account to show the information due to privacy reasons. The information 
being displayed is from my demo account, so examine the screenshots from a function-
ality view and not from the data or organization standpoint.
In the left column (Figure 12.2), you select how much data you want to view. 
You can see all data points in your account, a campaign, or an individual ad group.

Along the middle horizontal bar, you can choose what data points you want 
to see: keywords, placements, audiences, ads, ad groups, extensions, or campaigns 
(Figure 12.3). In addition, you can filter the data by unposted changes, errors, warn-
ings, or all the data available. Some tabs, such as Keywords, have multiple view 
options, including positives and negatives for keywords.
Figure 12.3  Choosing the data you want to view
In the top navigation column, you can right-click to choose exactly what types 
of data you want to view (Figure 12.4). Depending on the data you are viewing, you 
will see different customization options. For instance, on the Ads tab you will see items 
such as Headline, Description Line 1, and so on, whereas on the Keywords tab you will 
see items such as Match Type and Bids.
Figure 12.4  Customizing the Keywords column
The combination of the navigation and data columns allows you to work with 
any type and amount of data you wish to view. You can see all ads in your account or 
just negative keywords in a single ad group. How you want to view the data is entirely 
up to you.
AdWords Editor Shortcuts
Since this is a desktop application, the standard desktop shortcuts also work. For 
instance, for Windows users, Ctrl+C lets you copy the data point you are working 
on and Ctrl+V lets you paste that same data point into another area. For Mac users, 
the keyword shortcuts Cmd+C and Cmd+V do the same. Becoming familiar with the 

■  A dWor ds Edi tor Ov erv i ew

available shortcuts will allow you to quickly navigate through the interface and make 
bulk changes. Table 12.1 lists the shortcuts you’ve probably been using for years in 
various Windows and Mac applications. Table 12.2 deserves special attention, because 
it provides the special AdWords Editor shortcuts for Windows.

Using Visual Cues
As you add and remove data from the editor, visual symbols appear:
••
Plus (+): Added item.
••
Delta (∆): Edited item.
••
Minus (–): Deleted item.
••
Red-colored circle: Item may violate AdWords policies, and an exception 
request will need to be filed before you can make the change. Or, there is a 
reason the change cannot be posted, such as an active campaign having an end 
date in the past.
••
Yellow-colored circle: Item may violate AdWords policies, but you can still 
upload the changes. This commonly occurs when you have ad groups without 
keywords or ads. 
••
Green-colored circle: Item passed AdWords policy checks.
••
Comment icon: A comment is associated with that data point (Figure 12.5).
Figure 12.5  There is a comment associated with 
the keyword AdWords learning center.
The comments feature in AdWords Editor is extremely useful for keeping notes 
on why you made a change or why you added or removed a data item. It’s also nice for 
keeping track of something you need to check on in the future.
These are the basics of how the editor functions. You will discover many more 
options when using the editor. It’s an intuitive interface, so you’ll easily learn its func-
tionality once you understand the basics.
Viewing Your Account in AdWords Editor
When you first install the editor, it will not be associated with any AdWords accounts. 
The first step is to open your AdWords account in the editor. Either use the shortcut 
Ctrl+O or navigate to the File menu and click Open Account (Figure 12.6).
A dialog box opens where you can enter your AdWords login email address and the 
password. Once you enter the information, your account is downloaded into the editor.
You can enter the credentials of several different accounts in AdWords Editor 
for quick access to all those accounts. If you enter a My Client Center (MCC) email 
address, you will be able to see every account that is linked to that MCC.

Figure 12.6  Opening your AdWords 
account in the editor
In the editor, you can perform typical account management actions such as the 
following:
••
Change bids
••
Add or remove keywords and negative keywords
••
Add or remove Display Network targets
••
Add or remove text ads
••
Create or delete ad groups
••
Create or delete campaigns
••
Change campaign settings
When you first start using AdWords Editor, your AdWords Editor file and your 
AdWords online interface will contain the same data. As you make changes within 
AdWords Editor, those changes are not automatically made to your online account. 
To post changes online, click the Post Changes (or Post Selected Campaigns) button 
(Ctrl+Alt+S), and you will be presented with a box listing your changes (Figure 12.7). 
If your current view is not the entire account but either an ad group or a campaign, 
then you will have the option to post changes either for the entire account or for just a 
single campaign.
If you are posting a handful of changes, you can post them for your entire 
account at once. If you are posting more than 25,000 keywords or more than 3,000 
ads, you may run into problems. It is not uncommon for AdWords Editor to appear to 
be working but actually to have timed out on the back-end. Therefore, if you are mak-
ing large bulk changes, upload only changes to a single campaign at once. If you are 
making a few keyword changes or adding a dozen text ads, it will take the editor sec-
onds to make the changes. It could take a few hours to do large bulk changes, such as 
uploading 100,000 new keywords.
While AdWords Editor is posting changes, do not change those same campaigns 
in the online interface. The AdWords system could become confused as to which 
changes should be in effect.

Figure 12.7  Reviewing and then posting your changes
It is a good idea to make sure that no one else on your team is working on the 
same account, or the same campaigns within an account, while you are making changes 
offline in AdWords Editor. If you or anyone else on your team makes changes online, 
your AdWords Editor file will not be synced with your AdWords account. Additionally, 
if someone else has downloaded the same account into the editor and then posts their 
own sets of changes to the same items while you are still working on your edits, you will 
overwrite their changes when you post yours. It is a good idea to sync your AdWords 
Editor file with your Google AdWords account before you begin a new round of edits 
offline in AdWords Editor. To do that, use the Get Recent Account Changes option to 
download your account. If you want to download your entire account and overwrite 
any local changes you made in the editor, use the Get Full Account option (Figure 12.8).

Giving Multiple People Access to Your AdWords Account
In either your AdWords account or your MCC, you can create a user login for each 
person who has access to your account (Figure 12.9).
Figure 12.9  Giving account access to additional people
This ability is useful from both security and tracking standpoints. If someone 
leaves your company, you can disable a single login and not worry about having to 
change all of your access passwords. When someone makes changes in your account, 
the change shows up in the My Change History tool with the associated login that 
made each change.
When someone first opens your account in AdWords Editor, they can download 
your account with their login credentials. When that person posts changes to your 
account from AdWords Editor, the account used to post those changes will show up in 
the My Change History tool as well, so you can track which login is making changes 
to your account. The Change History report can help you fix things when one person 
inadvertently overwrites another person’s changes. However, it is never any fun to 
make the same changes twice, so the best option is to make sure that only one person is 
working on a campaign at a time.
However, if you would like even more control over who can make changes to 
your account, AdWords Editor has an additional feature called Export Changes for 
Sharing (AES) (Figure 12.10). The AdWords Editor file extension is .aes.

Figure 12.10  Exporting your editor changes for sharing
You can export your editor file and send it to another person who can open your 
account in their AdWords Editor program. That person can then make changes to your 
account, and instead of uploading the changes, they can send the file back to you. Then 
you can see what their proposed changes are and have the capability to accept or reject 
changes (Figure 12.11).
Figure 12.11  Accepting or rejecting changes
Once you have accepted the changes you would like to go live in your account, 
you can post those changes. If you have several people who work on your account, hav-
ing a central gatekeeper who understands all of the changes and their implications can 
be useful in maintaining control over what is happening inside your AdWords account.
Scaling Your Account
Most of the best practices for PPC account management you read about recommend 
creating small ad groups of tightly themed keywords and handwriting ad copy that can 
be tested for those keywords.
While these are best practices for small and medium-size accounts, it is not 
always practical when you are managing thousands of ad groups, tens of thousands of 
keywords, and thousands of ads. However, there are ways of mass-creating keywords 
and ad copy inside a spreadsheet program and then using AdWords Editor to import 
that information into your account.
First you will learn how to import anywhere from a single keyword to thousands 
of keywords into your account. Then you will examine how to import ad copy for 
those keywords.

Importing Keywords
AdWords Editor lets you copy and paste data from other programs into the editor. 
This allows you to use a spreadsheet program, such as Excel, to create and organize 
your keywords and then copy that data and paste it into AdWords Editor. Just follow 
these steps:
	 1.	
Navigate to the Keywords tab, click Make Multiple Changes, and choose Add/
Update Multiple Keywords (Figure 12.12).
Figure 12.12  Mass importing keywords into AdWords Editor
This will bring you to a screen where you can paste large amounts of data. There 
are a few ways that you can import the data; for now, we are going to focus on 
importing everything so that you can automatically create new campaigns, ad 
groups, and add keywords all at once.
	 2.	
Create an Excel file where the columns, in this order, contain these data points 
(Figure 12.13):

	 3.	
In Excel, you can then create all the data you want to add to your AdWords 
account. If you conducted research with the AdWords Keyword Planner (from 
Chapter 3, “Keyword Tools: Extracting Valuable Data from Google”) and have 
hundreds or thousands of keywords, you would not want to go through the 
AdWords online interface to add all of those keywords to various ad groups. 
Instead, put your keywords in column 3, and then add the campaign name, ad 
group name, and so on for the data you want to import.
When you import the data, if there is no campaign or ad group name within a 
campaign that you are adding, AdWords Editor will automatically create those 
campaigns and ad groups for you.
	 4.	
Once you have organized the data, copy and paste it into AdWords Editor. At 
the top of the screen, check the option “My keyword information below includes 
columns for campaigns and ad group names.”
	 5.	
Click the Preview button. This will bring you to a wizard that asks you to 
define the columns. Define the columns based on the Excel organization and 
then choose “Remember the order of my column headers for future imports” 
(Figure 12.14). This will ensure you can skip this step in the future.

Click the Process button and the editor will add your new keywords to your 
account.
If you created new ad groups or campaigns, navigate to those items in the editor 
to set your bids, daily budget, and other campaign or ad group settings.
Creating Thousands of Keywords and Ad Groups
You can also use Excel to create hundreds of thousands of keywords, although when 
doing so, it is suggested that you just create one campaign at a time.
Let’s reexamine the keyword methodology chart from Chapter 2, “Performing 
Keyword Research.” In the keyword listing methodology, you will create several lists of 
several keywords. Table 12.3 is the maternity shirt example from Chapter 2.

The first thing to do when scaling your accounts is to determine your campaigns 
and ad groups. For ease of explanation, in this example we are going to assume it is 
a national retailer who is just getting started, and therefore they need only national 
search campaigns.
In addition, make the assumption that the lists in Table 12.3 are much longer. 
For instance, there are many more product types, attributes, brands, and so forth that 
could be included in the lists in Table 12.3.
Since for this example you are using a single campaign, the next step is to 
decide on the ad groups. In the earlier list, the words are not yet defined as ad groups 
or keywords. For instance, you could have the ad group Maternity Cotton Shirts 
with keywords such as xl maternity cotton shirts. Or you could have the ad group 
Maternity Shirts with the keyword cotton maternity shirts. There are many possibili-
ties. Therefore, determine how many ad groups you want to devote to your current list. 
If this company sold men’s, women’s, children’s, and other clothing, you might not want 
to use thousands of ad groups for just maternity clothing. Since you would also have 
hundreds or thousands of ad groups for each of men’s, women’s, and children’s clothing 

Chapter 12:  Sav i ng T i m e a n d Sca li ng Accou n ts w i t h A dWor ds Edi tor  ■
412
categories, it would not make sense to start with thousands of ad groups for a specific 
clothing type, such as maternity, shoes, or outerwear. An account might get there after 
learning what is converting and optimizing the account, but let’s start more simply.
If the company sold only maternity clothing, and therefore all your ad groups 
were going to be related to maternity, you could be more liberal in your ad group selec-
tion and have thousands of maternity ad groups.
Organizing Your Account
Account organization is so important to long-term success that it can be useful to cre-
ate a document that covers how you are going to reach your audience, how that audi-
ence searches, and how you are going to break down your ad groups and campaigns 
into a manageable account structure before even opening your AdWords account. 
Chapter 14, “Organizing Accounts Successfully,” takes an in-depth look at successful 
account organization.
Let’s assume that after you did research you found out these points (and these 
are made up, so please do not use them for your organization):
••
The words maternity and pregnancy are used interchangeably, and user intent 
did not vary based on the word being searched.
••
Cotton and stretchable are the most common attributes searched, and the search 
volume for the other materials is much smaller.
••
There is a large search volume for branded terms, and you are allowed to use the 
branded terms in your ads and in compliance with the AdWords trademark poli-
cies and applicable laws.
••
It is summertime, and while the search volume for swimsuits and sundresses is 
high, those words do not combine well with the list in Table 12.3, and you will 
need a second list for sundresses and swimsuits.
This is a short list of points for illustration purposes only. Your research should 
uncover more information about the searchers.
Armed with this information, it is now time to create the ad groups. The infor-
mation leads you to making these assumptions about your organization:
••
The words maternity and pregnancy are used interchangeably, and user intent 
did not vary based on the word being searched.
You are going to use the words maternity and pregnancy as keyword modifiers 
and not as different ad groups. Therefore, whenever a keyword is added, it will 
be added twice, once with the pregnancy modifier and once with the maternity 
modifier. For instance, your keywords would be maternity cotton shirt and 
pregnancy cotton shirt.
••
Cotton and stretchable are the most common attributes searched; the search vol-
ume for the other materials is much smaller.

■  Sca li ng You r Accou n t
413
For each product type, there will be three ad groups: Cotton, Stretchable, and 
Other. Therefore, you will have Cotton Suits, Stretchable Suits, and Other Suits 
as ad groups.
In the Other Suits ad group, you will use all of the additional product attribute 
modifiers as keyword modifiers. For instance, pregnancy wool suit, maternity 
wool suit, pregnancy rayon suit, and maternity rayon suit would be some of the 
keywords in that ad group.
••
There is a large search volume for branded terms, and the branded terms can be 
used in the ad copy since they will be compliant with the trademark policies and 
laws.
Since there is such high brand search volume, and you want to use the branded 
terms in the ad copy, you need to create brand-specific ad groups.
Therefore, you will make a list of all the brands and what ad groups contain 
keywords that each brand sells. For instance, if Chiarakruza sold only shirts, 
pants, and sundresses, then you would clone the non-branded ad groups that 
contain those items and make new, brand-specific ad groups from them by add-
ing Chiarakruza as another product attribute to those ad groups.
However, if you have one ad group that is Chiarakruza Maternity Shirts and 
another one that is Maternity Shirts with some broad match keywords, Google 
could choose which keyword to trigger and which ad to serve. Therefore, in the 
non-branded ad group, Maternity Shirts, you would add the negative keyword 
Chiarakruza.
••
It is summertime, and while the search volume for swimsuits and sundresses is 
high, those words do not combine well with the list from Table 12.3, and you 
will need a second list for sundresses and swimsuits.
This information will start our next action list. You will have to do more research 
on sundresses and bathing suits and create new lists before adding these ad groups.
With this information, you would then re-create your lists to first create ad 
groups, as shown in Table 12.4.

Once you have listed all of your ad groups, you can use your keyword list infor-
mation to create the keywords that fit into each of these ad groups. By going through 
this exercise in a spreadsheet, you can use formulas to create thousands of ad groups 
and tens of thousands of keywords fairly easily.
If you do not have all of this research, then instead, what you need to consider 
when creating your ad groups is the ads. What attributes from the list do you want 
to put into the ads? For instance, if you determine that size does not matter and that 
brand, product type, and product attributes are the main factors that need to be in 
the ads, those items would determine your ad groups. The other items, such as color 
or size, would be keyword modifiers to those ad group names to create the keywords 
within those ad groups.
The hard part to creating thousands of ad groups is the initial research into the 
keyword lists, determining what needs to be in the ads, and laying out your account 
structure. For larger accounts, the actual keyword creation can be easier than the plan-
ning stages.
Importing Keywords and Ad Groups into AdWords Editor
Once you have this information organized, it is a simple copy and paste from your 
spreadsheet into the bulk import function of AdWords Editor to get the data into your 
editor file. If you have created new ad groups or campaigns, make sure you set the 
appropriate bids, budget, and other settings.
If you are creating a campaign that will have more than 25,000 keywords or 
3,000 ads, upload the keyword data to your AdWords account before creating your 
ads. These ad groups will show a warning because they contain no ads. However, when 
you are selectively uploading from an AdWords Editor file, the smallest amount of 
data you can upload is a single campaign. AdWords Editor can time out when upload-
ing huge amounts of data; therefore, by selectively uploading the keywords first, you 
are uploading less total data at once and mitigating the chances of the data not being 
uploaded into your account. After you have created the ads from the next section, 
upload just the ads as the second step to create whole ad groups.
Now that you have created potentially hundreds or thousands of ad groups with 
tens of thousands of keywords, it is time to create ad copy for those ad groups.
Easily Creating Thousands of Ads
A search ad group is not complete until it contains both keywords and ads. After deter-
mining your ad groups and populating those ad groups with keywords, the next step is 
to write associated ads.
AdWords Editor also supports the bulk importing of ad copy. In the editor, per-
form these steps:
	 1.	
Navigate to the Ads tab and click Make Multiple Changes.

Note:  The ad group name is for your purposes only. It does not affect items like Quality Score; however, it can 
be useful to name ad groups with names that reflect the keywords so you understand what the ad group is about 
and also so you can use Excel formulas to help to help create ads.
When creating the ad groups and campaign names for your ads, make sure that 
you use the exact same names from your keyword import sheet. If you use different 
campaign names, you will have one campaign with only ads and a different campaign 
with only keywords. There are simple tricks you can use that will help you write mul-
tiple ads at once to save you precious time.
Writing Multiple Ads
If you are writing only a handful of ads, customize them by hand with the best prac-
tices from Chapter 4, “Writing Compelling Ads.” However, if you are creating thou-
sands of ads for hundreds or thousands of ad groups, you will need to write formulas 
to create this many ads.
The first step in writing multiple ads with formulas is to break down your ad 
groups into similar product lines where formulaic ads will still be relevant to the searcher. 
For instance, if you sell maternity and men’s clothing, a tagline such as “Maternity Wear 
for Fashionable Moms” would not resonate with the men searching for clothes.
Once these are broken down into various ad groups, write some calls to action, 
headlines, and taglines for those ad groups.
For instance, let’s say these are some of the initial ad copy lines you want to try:
••
Headlines:
••
Ad Group Name (in this case, you are assuming the ad group name is closely 
associated to the keywords in the ad group and that it would make a good 
headline)
••
Fashionable Maternity Clothing
••
Shop at Company Name

••
Taglines:

••
Display URL:
••
Company URL
••
Company URL/AdGroupName
••
Company URL/Shop
Next, you will write a set of formulas where you will insert this information 
(see Table 12.5). The more traffic you are going to buy, the more ads you can write. 
Because you are writing formulas that will be used across multiple ad groups, you can 
also run reports where you are looking at which formulaic writing is leading to clicks 
and conversions, so you do not have to rely on testing at the ad group level.

Mass Ad Copy-Writing Tools
While this section will give you an idea of how large companies create thousands of ads, it can be time 
consuming and difficult to create different benefit lines by both ad group and across a campaign. You 
can use a tool like the Mass Ad Copy Creator from CertifiedKnowledge.org (http://certified-
knowledge.org/membership-information/ppc-tools/mass-ad-copy-creator-tool/) 
to create thousands of ads quite easily.

Chapter 12:  Sav i ng T i m e a n d Sca li ng Accou n ts w i t h A dWor ds Edi tor  ■

Once you have the formulas written, plug in the ad copy variables. You can eas-
ily do this in Excel by calling information from different cells within the spreadsheet. 
For instance, if your headline is Ad Group Name and the ad group is located in col-
umn B of your spreadsheet, you could enter =B3 and the cell would be replaced by the 
content of cell B3. Since Excel automatically adjusts formulas as you copy, paste, and 
drag them, it is simple to write the formulas for one ad group and then copy and paste 
the selection multiple times or drag the cells down across multiple ad groups. If your 
ad group was Chiarakruza Maternity Shirts, then your final ad copy would look like

The last ad is just one we added to test what a multiple-line ad copy would do. 
Feel free to add additional ad copy as it makes sense to your goals. In this example, 
you would replace CompanyName with your actual company, and the same with the dis-
play URL.
In addition, you will have a destination URL based on where you are sending 
traffic to on your website, but you would not use a formula to create the destination 
URL. You want to make sure the destination URL resolves to the correct page on your 
website. However, you can use this method to create any tracking codes for your des-
tination URLs as long as your URL still resolves to the correct page once additional 
parameters have been added.
The exception to this rule is when you have excellent search result pages and 
wish to send the traffic to those pages instead of your typical product or category 
pages. If you do want to send traffic to search results on your site, then you can also 
write formulas for the destination URL to send the traffic to a search result page of 
your website for each keyword or ad group.

Character Limits and Naming Conventions
When you write formula-based ads, some of them will be outside of character limit 
policies. If you are writing these ads in Excel, use the conditional formatting to high-
light instances where you have gone over character limits. Then you will need to adjust 
the ads appropriately.
For instance, in the previous example, the word Chiarakruza contains so many 
characters that a few of the ad copy lines have exceeded their character limits, such as 
the display URL CompanyName.com/ChiarakruzaMaternityShirts. In this instance, you 
would remove the MaternityShirts aspect, leaving the CompanyName.com/Chiarakruza, 
which might be within the 35 allocated display URL characters depending on how long 
the company’s URL is.
When you create the ad copy to match your existing keyword ad groups, make 
sure the naming conventions for your campaigns and ad groups are identical. If they 
are not the same, you will have one ad group with keywords and another ad group 
with just ad copy.
AdWords Editor Find and Replace
The editor has global find and replace capabilities. Under the Edit menu, you can do a find and replace 
across the entire account or a subset of the account depending on the data you are viewing. This 
feature is very useful if you are changing just one aspect of an ad, such as a discount code. Also, if you 
accidentally use the wrong spelling or URL in a bulk import, you can then just find the mistake and 
replace it with the correct information.
Once you have finished writing your ad copy, copy the new ads and paste them 
into AdWords Editor. AdWords Editor will inform you of how many ads you are 
adding and if any new ad groups or campaigns will be created. If you have already 
imported the keywords, you should not be creating new ad groups or campaigns. 
Hence, if the editor informs you that new campaigns or ad groups will be created, 
check your naming conventions.
Advantages of Using Excel with AdWords Editor
Using a spreadsheet and AdWords Editor together allows you to easily import large 
amounts of information into your AdWords account in a quick and scalable manner. 
The hard work of scaling your accounts should no longer be the AdWords front-end 
interface. The hard work should be in mapping your ad groups, keywords, and ad copy 
together so that you can still use many of the best practices from those who create ad 
groups by hand, yet in a scalable manner.
Once you have larger accounts, especially ones written through formulas, you 
can use the best practice optimization techniques discussed in Chapter 17, “Step by 

Chapter 12:  Sav i ng T i m e a n d Sca li ng Accou n ts w i t h A dWor ds Edi tor  ■
420
Step: Creating and Monitoring Your AdWords Account,” to find your strengths and 
weaknesses and be able to find ad groups that need to be further broken down based 
on returns. Even if you have smaller accounts, the exact same optimization techniques 
apply, only you will have a smaller number of ad groups to analyze.
Optimizing Display with AdWords Editor
In two previous chapters, you saw examples of why it is best to have your campaigns 
set only to search or to display. If your campaigns are currently set to both, do not 
fret—with AdWords Editor, it will take you only a minute to duplicate your campaigns 
and change the appropriate settings.
First, navigate to the campaign that you want to duplicate. Then use the copy 
(Ctrl+C) and paste (Ctrl+V) functions to duplicate that campaign. With those two 
simple key combinations, you now have two identical campaigns.
The campaign you just created will have an error associated with it because it 
has the same name as another campaign (Figure 12.18). Rename the first campaign 
as Current Campaign Name - Search. Then rename the second campaign as Current 
Campaign Name - Display. This will not only fix the error but let you quickly tell if 
you are working on a display or a search campaign.
Figure 12.18  Campaign name error in AdWords Editor
Once the campaigns are renamed, it is time to change the settings so that the 
first campaign is only displayed on search and the second campaign is only shown on 
the Display Network (Figure 12.19).
Next, you will want to go through the typical display organization techniques 
discussed to choose your display keywords and placements. However, because your 
new campaign is targeted only to the Display Network, you can use more general key-
words to help create a theme for your ad group and not have to worry about those key-
words triggering your search ads.

Best Practices for Using AdWords Editor
Whenever you are hesitant to start working on your AdWords account because of the 
online interface, it is time to use AdWords Editor.
While there are a few features that are available within the AdWords online 
interface that are not in the editor, they are generally settings that are not commonly 
used. In addition, they are usually features that are not changed often; hence, they are 
not always necessary to have in the editor.
••
Your view in the editor is determined by settings. To get started, use the left 
navigation column to select the amount of data you want to view (account, 
campaign, or specific ad group), and the middle horizontal bar to select the data 
points (ads, keywords, ad groups, or campaigns).
••
Look for visual cues in the editor. The red or yellow warning labels let you find 
problems. The plus sign or minus sign shows what is being added or deleted.
••
Use the comments feature in AdWords Editor, designated by a conversation icon. 
This will allow you to keep track of why you made certain changes for future 
analysis.
••
At a minimum, you should give everyone who has access to your account their 
own login. If you have a large team, make sure that only one person at a time is 
editing the same account elements to avoid overwriting someone else’s changes. 
One way to ensure that is to use the Export Your Account For Sharing feature 
and then have all changes come through one person.
••
AdWords Editor allows the bulk creation of keywords, ad copy, campaigns, 
and ad groups. When you bulk create items, always check and adjust your bids, 

Chapter 12:  Sav i ng T i m e a n d Sca li ng Accou n ts w i t h A dWor ds Edi tor  ■
422
geographic targets, and other ad group and campaign settings before you push 
the changes live.
••
When creating large numbers of keywords, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Determine your ad groups.
	
2.	
Populate those ad groups with the proper keywords.
••
When creating large amounts of ads, use formulaic ad-creation writing, but 
ensure that the ads are still relevant to the user and fall within the editorial 
requirements before posting the ads.
••
Learn the keyboard shortcuts. Although it is easy to duplicate a campaign for 
display and search targeting purposes, you can also use shortcut keys to select 
all ad copy that requires an exception request and fill out a single exception 
request at a time.
AdWords Editor is a powerful tool to help you quickly add data, remove data, or 
change existing data, such as bids. Using AdWords Editor import functions along with 
Excel can not only save you time but also allow you to use best practice account man-
agement in both small and large accounts.
However, it is not enough to create thousands of ads or tens of thousands of key-
words if they do not fit within the goals of your business. In the next chapter, you will 
learn various bid strategies so you can set bids that increase your company’s profits.

Setting Your Marketing Goals
The first thing you should do in any advertising campaign, before you spend a single 
penny, is to set the goals your advertising campaign needs to accomplish. It does not 
matter if your advertising outlet is Google AdWords, yellow pages ads, newspaper ads, 
radio, TV, or any other medium. If you do not have goals set for the campaign, you 
cannot define success and optimize the campaigns to increase performance.
Many companies will have multiple goals. You may also need to refine your goals 
over time. Let’s examine the steps a plumber may take in setting and refining goals.
Before the advertising campaign starts, the plumber examines his phone records 
and realizes that he receives 50 calls per month. Of those calls, he closes five jobs a 
month. Therefore, his conversion rate is 10 percent. His average job nets him $1,000, 
and it takes about 20 hours to accomplish each job. Since he works only 160 hours 
per month, he figures out he needs to close eight jobs per month. Because he has a 10 
percent conversion rate, he needs to receive 80 calls per month. However, each job is 
worth $1,000, so he does some math and realizes that when he pays $100 per phone 
call his advertising costs are equal to his revenue and he has nothing left over after 
completing the jobs. Therefore, he wants make double what a call costs him to get and 
is willing to pay $50 per phone call.
In the first month of advertising, he manages to receive 50 additional calls to 
a dedicated phone number exclusively for this campaign. However, all of these calls 
come from keywords for fixing pipes and broken showers. His conversion rate is much 
higher, 20 percent, but these smaller pipe repair jobs take only 3 hours each. Even 
though he exceeded his goal of 30 additional phone calls, he ended up working 30 
additional hours that month. Therefore, he needs to refine his goals.
His close rate for large jobs such as kitchen remodeling is only 1 in 20, or 5 
percent. After doing some math, he decides he wants to do three kitchen remodeling 
jobs each month and then fill in the rest of his time with small jobs. Therefore, his final 
goals are 60 phone calls for kitchen remodeling each month and 134 calls for small 
jobs. In addition, he is willing to pay $50 for the kitchen remodeling calls but only $25 
for the smaller job phone calls.
An e-commerce company might take a different approach. The company might 
look at their finances and realize that based on their margins, they need a 200 percent 
ROAS for all products sold. However, they also have a newsletter, and on average, each 
subscriber makes at least two $50 purchases per year. Therefore, after doing some cal-
culations on the returns they want from their email marketing, they are willing to pay 
$10 per newsletter subscriber. But since they need to pay overhead and monthly bills 
each month, and the newsletters are long-term investments, they must have at least 
1,000 e-commerce sales per month. 
Many times a company will need to dig back into its business model to under-
stand how the business makes money and what is required to not just hit payroll each

week but to also grow as a company. This is often harder than setting bids for ad 
groups or keywords. Consider a drop-shipper that realized that if they could sell 7 per-
cent more goods, they could switch suppliers and receive a 10 percent discount on the 
wholesale price of the goods they purchase. If this is the case, that drop-shipper could 
run an additional campaign at a breakeven number just to hit the new sales numbers 
so they could save on the total cost of goods they buy—which would put more dollars 
back into their bank account without changing a single bid price.
Many companies do not know their internal numbers well enough to set goals 
that improve their supply chain. However, setting goals is essential.
Some of the more common goals are as follows:
••
Set percentage ROAS on goods sold.
••
List a minimum number of sales per month.
••
Determine your minimum revenue per month.
••
Achieve a certain number of phone calls per month per product.
••
Define your average cost per phone call by product. 
••
Set a cost per acquisition of a new customer, newsletter subscription, or RSS 
feed subscription.
••
Choose how many new visitors you want per day.
••
List the number of total visitors per day (this is a common goal for publishers 
who make money by selling CPM ads on their website).
••
Determine your target number of leads per month.
••
Set a cost per lead.
Once the company examines itself and understands how it makes money, it must 
set the goals for what the marketing campaigns need to accomplish. Once these goals 
are set, they need to be measured.
Measuring Results with Google’s Conversion-Tracking Code
Optimizing Google AdWords campaigns can only be done with proper metrics. If you 
do not have the numbers to examine, there is no way to know if you are hitting your 
goals or even what keywords and ad copy are helping you reach those goals.
Therefore, for every goal you set, you need to find a way to measure it. This 
may lead you to institute phone call tracking, FeedBurner for RSS tracking, Google 
Analytics for page views per visits, or other software as necessary.
Google offers a conversion-tracking script you can implement that will add con-
version metrics to your AdWords account. Once you install the conversion-tracking 
code, you will be able to see cost per action (CPA), total conversions, and ROAS 
(return on ad spend) numbers by keyword, ad, and landing page in both the AdWords 
interface and your AdWords reports.

Clarifying the CPA vs. CPC Confusion
CPC, or cost per click, is a standard acronym across AdWords; generally when you see CPC, you assume 
cost per click. However, many reports show cost per conversion as CPC as well, which leads to confu-
sion. When CPC refers to conversions, often the acronym is changed to CPA, or cost per action, even 
though the reported metric is conversions and not actions. Whenever you see the term CPA, it could 
mean cost per action or cost per conversion—both of which are how much you pay for a conversion or 
action to occur on your site.
AdWords Conversion-Tracking Code
The AdWords conversion-tracking code is powerful and easy to install. The first 
step is to navigate to the Conversions page under the Tools tab within your account 
(Figure 13.1). This screen will show you all the currently defined conversion actions. 
Figure 13.1  AdWords conversion-tracking overview
Click + Conversion and you will be presented with a screen where you can set up 
tracking from a few different sources:
••
Tracking For Webpages: The code will be placed on a web page. This is the most 
common level of tracking.
••
Call On-site: Select this option if you are tracking phone calls.
••
App Download: This is used to track app downloads from Google Play or 
iTunes. 
••
Import: This allows you to import conversions into AdWords.
Choose a name for the conversion type that describes the type of conversion you 
want to track. Next, you will see a screen where you define information about the con-
version type you are tracking (see Figure 13.2). 

■  M e asu r i ng R e su lts w i t h Google’s Con v ersion-T r ack i ng Code
427
Figure 13.2  Conversion-tracking script wizard
The items are as follows:
Conversion Category  Choose the type of conversion you wish to track such as a lead, sale, 
signup, page view, or other. This will allow you to create reports that segment your 
reports by a select set of categories.
Conversion Window  This is how long you want the cookie active that will count the action 
as a conversion. If you have been advertising for a while, then you can examine the 
Time Lag report (Figure 13.3) to determine how long it takes a user to convert from 
the click to the conversion. If you do not have this information yet, then examine your 
buying funnel to determine the time lag between click and conversion.
Markup Language  Choose the coding language of your website. Please note that exten-
sions such as .php or .aspx are still HTML pages. The other options are for mobile 
extensions such as .xhtml. If this is your standard website, choose HTML. If you are 
placing the code on a mobile site, examine the options to make sure you are calling the 
appropriate language code.
Conversion Value  This field will populate your AdWords reports with the actual revenue 
you gained from an action. In your AdWords reports, you will be able to see that key-
word 1 led to $15 in revenue, and keyword 2 led to $25 in revenue. There are three 
ways of defining this field.

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
428
Figure 13.3  Time Lag report
The first is to leave it blank or use the number 1 as the field number. In this case, you 
will not see revenue in your AdWords reports; you will see only the total number of 
conversions.
The second is to do some math and then put in the estimated revenue for that action. 
For instance, if the e-commerce company from the previous example were using this 
method to track their newsletter subscriptions, they would enter 50, since that is what 
they calculated a newsletter subscription was worth to their company.
The third way to use this field is to enter a variable from your shopping cart. Most 
shopping carts have three variables on the checkout page: total cost of goods, cost of 
shipping, and total cost to consumer. Most companies do not make money on shipping, 
so by entering the variable for total cost of goods, you will be able to see the actual 
revenue that each keyword or ad copy led to on your website. To find the variable, ask 
your shopping cart provider or web developer. They should be able to assist you.
Tracking Indicator  When a user clicks on your AdWords ad, a cookie is placed on their 
browser. If that cookie is on a user’s browser when they get to a page where you are 
using this conversion code, Google will display a piece of text to the user. You can cus-
tomize this text to fit the look and feel of your website, or you can update your privacy 

■  M e asu r i ng R e su lts w i t h Google’s Con v ersion-T r ack i ng Code
429
policy to inform users that you are using a tracking script and not display any text to 
the user.
View-Through Conversion Window  When someone sees an image or rich media ad on the 
Display Network and does not click on the ad, but they come back to your site directly 
and convert at a later time, they are considered a view-through conversion. The view-
through conversion window can be set for up to 30 days. 
How Browsers Load Web Pages
A browser loads a web page in the order in which it receives the web page code. If after the open body 
tag (<body>) your website has several scripts, the browser must load all the scripts before the text of 
your website can be loaded. If a script is slow to load—or worse, it times out—the user will stare at a 
blank page for a while until the scripts finish loading or time out. Therefore, it is best to add all scripts 
at the bottom of your web pages before the close body tag (</body>). When you add scripts to the 
bottom of a page, the user may still leave the page before the script loads, which will cause you to lose 
some tracking data; however, all users will be able to see the text of your site first and not think there 
is a problem if the page loads slowly. It is better to lose some tracking and keep the user’s trust than to 
track everything and lose consumer confidence.
If you have many scripts on a page, such as a Facebook Like, Tweet This, and a conversion code, place 
the scripts in the order of importance—any single slow script can prevent the others from ever load-
ing. To check your page load times, you can use PageSpeed Insights, a free tool from Google: http://
developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights.
The one exception is asynchronous scripts. These scripts do not stop the page from loading while they 
load, so you can put asynchronous scripts at the top of your pages and they should not affect your 
page load speed. 
Once you have filled out all the options, click the Save button on the page. 
On the next page, you can either email the conversion code to someone who makes 
changes to your website, or you can copy the code yourself and put it in your website 
(Figure 13.4).
Copy this code and paste it in the thank-you page or other type of page that 
signifies a conversion on your website, such as the view of a store locator results page. 
This code goes only on the page that the user sees after they have completed an action, 
such as the “Thank you for shopping” or “Thank you for contacting us” page. If you 
accidentally install this code in a global footer, you will be tracking page views for 
every page on your site.
If you have multiple conversion actions, such as a newsletter and e-commerce 
conversion, use a different tracking code for each action. If you use the same code for 
all actions, you will not be able to see which keywords, ad copy, or landing pages lead 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
430
to the different types of actions on your website. Run the conversion-tracking wizard 
for each conversion action you want to track, and then install that code on the appro-
priate completion pages associated with those actions.
Figure 13.4  AdWords conversion-tracking code
Google Analytics Tracking
If you are using Google Analytics, then you can also define your goals in Google 
Analytics and import those goals into AdWords. Before you will see the import fea-
ture in AdWords, you must first link Google Analytics and AdWords together, which 
you can accomplish in the Linked Accounts section under the My Account navigation 
(Figure 13.5).
Once Google Analytics is linked to AdWords, you can click the button labeled 
Import From Google Analytics, and you will be able to choose and import goals from 
Google Analytics (Figure 13.6).

Google Analytics vs. Google AdWords Script Tracking
There is a difference in how the AdWords conversion script and the Google Analytics 
goals count conversions. The AdWords script counts a conversion only if the user 
clicked on your AdWords ad and converted before the cookie expired. When a visitor 
converts, AdWords attributes the conversion to the last ad clicked and adds the conver-
sion to the day of the click on your AdWords ad.
For instance, if someone clicked on your ad last week and then returns to your 
site today through some other means than by clicking on an ad, AdWords will report 
that conversion as having happened last week. However, if they returned to your site 
today by clicking on an ad and bought something today, then AdWords will attri-
bute that conversion to today’s ad click—the last click before the conversion. Google 
Analytics, on the other hand, attributes the conversions to the last entrance to the 
site and to the actual day the conversion occurred. The exception to this rule is direct 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
432
traffic since Google Analytics does not overwrite referring data if the user typed your 
website in the address bar of their browser.
This can lead to the two systems not tracking conversions in the same way. Let’s 
say that this is how the conversion occurred:
••
User clicks on your AdWords ad on day 1.
••
Users clicks on your organic listing on day 3.
••
User converts on your website.
In this scenario, the AdWords script will attribute the conversion to day 1 and 
show what keyword, ad, and so on received the conversion. Google Analytics will attri-
bute the conversion to day 3 and show that an organic click received the conversion. 
If you are focused purely on AdWords and want to see more total conversion 
data in AdWords, then the AdWords script is the best way to track conversions. If you 
are focused on attribution management, which means giving some attribution to a con-
version to multiple channels, then Google Analytics is the better tracking system.
There are some cases where you must use Google Analytics because third-party pro-
viders have integrated their software into Google Analytics. This is common to see when 
you are using call tracking. In those cases, you will have to import Google Analytics goals 
into AdWords to see phone calls conversions by keywords, ads, and other data points. 
It is useful to verify your conversion tracking before you go live by viewing the 
page source to see if the code is on the proper pages. If you are using Google Analytics, 
then you can do the conversion action on your website to make sure the conversion 
data shows in Google Analytics. 
It is harder to verify the AdWords script because you need to make an ad active, 
click on your ad to set the cookie on your machine, pause your account, and then con-
vert on your site and make sure that your conversion is displayed within AdWords. It is 
useful to verify the conversion before you go live, but doing so will mean that you are 
not losing valuable data the first day you start marketing. 
Accessing Valuable Conversion Data in AdWords Reports
Once you have implemented conversion-tracking codes, you will have access to valu-
able conversion data. In most of the interface screens, you can customize the columns. 
Under the Conversions section, you can add conversion data to your view (Figure 13.7).
After you have selected the conversion columns, you can see your conversion 
rates (see Figure 13.8). You can view conversions, revenue, cost per conversion, and 
conversion rate by many data points, including (but not limited to) the following:
••
Keyword
••
Ad
••
Ad landing page
••
Ad group
••
Campaign

As you explore bidding techniques in this chapter and examine reports in future 
chapters, I will assume you have installed the AdWords conversion-tracking script. If 
you are using another tool to track revenue, you can still use all these techniques, but 
you will have to combine the AdWords reports with your own metrics system.
Tracking Phone Calls
You can use the AdWords call extension to track phone calls from your ads. Often you 
will want to track calls that originate from your site as well.
There are several ways to track phone calls, including using AdWords’s conver-
sion-tracking code. Many vendors will let you buy one or more tracking phone num-
bers. Some vendors will help you track phone calls by keyword, ad copy, or landing 
page. The more phone numbers you want, the more expensive the solutions become. 
There are a few ways that you can track calls that occur on your website:
Unique Phone Number per Data Point  This solution tracks search engine, ad group, keyword, 
and so on. It’s the most accurate but the most expensive.
Unique Extension per Data Point  This solution can be cheaper to institute with a sophisti-
cated in-house call system. However, you will need to correlate extensions with data 
points.
Code Identifiers  You can generate a code underneath the phone number on your site that 
is associated with AdWords data points. Then have the sales reps collect the identifiers 
from callers and correlate sales to data points. This is not a hard method to implement, 
but it does require retraining sales reps.
Estimate Using Confidence Factors  If you have a high call volume, instead of having unique 
phone numbers or extensions by data points, you can create confidence factors so that 
when a certain keyword is clicked, on average the phone rings 2 percent of the time.
Session Tracking  Session tracking is the most common way that third-party vendors attri-
bute conversions to individual keywords and ads. When a user clicks on your ad, a 
unique phone number is used for that user session. When the session ends, the phone 
number goes back into the pool of numbers for the site. This is often the cheapest and 
easiest way to track phone calls for a large AdWords account; however, due to users 
writing down numbers, multiple sessions occurring, and other reasons, there will be 
some error rate (usually less than 10%–15%) of misreported calls. 
AdWords Conversion-Tracking Code  If you can get someone back to your website after the call, 
you can use the AdWords conversion-tracking code. You may have to be creative—gen-
erating online receipts, for example—to consistently get people back to your website 
to trigger the code. This method is the cheapest to implement and will allow you to see 
phone call conversion data inside your AdWords account.

Exploring AdWords Bidding Options
AdWords supports several methods of setting bids. Setting max CPCs, also known 
as manual bidding for clicks, is the default method, but depending on your goals, the 
other methods may work better for you.
These options are at the campaign level in your account. Hence, you can have 
one campaign that uses one method and another campaign that uses a different 
method. However, all ad groups in the same campaign will utilize the same bidding 
methodology. The one exception to this rule is flexible bidding, which we will cover 
separately. So for the purposes of initially explaining all of the bidding options, we will 
ignore flexible bidding and cover that as its own section.
Navigate to the Campaign Settings tab. Under the Bidding And Budget options 
(Figure 13.9), you will see up to five bid methods.
Figure 13.9  Campaign bidding methods
Focus on Clicks, Option 1
The first option under Focus On Clicks is “I’ll manually set my bids for clicks.” This is 
the default method of bidding. You will set a maximum (max) CPC, and you will pay 
up to that max CPC. The advantage of this option is that it is compatible with all the 
advanced options in AdWords. For instance, if you want to use advanced ad schedul-
ing where you change your maximum bid by time of day, you must use this bidding 
method.
Focus on Clicks, Option 2
The second option under Focus On Clicks is “AdWords will set my bids to help maxi-
mize clicks within my target budget,” also known as the Budget Optimizer. With 
the Budget Optimizer, Google will attempt to maximize the number of clicks your 
campaign receives. You can choose to set a maximum bid cap or let AdWords take 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
436
full control of the bidding. I recommend that you set a bid cap; otherwise, you could 
end up paying a significant amount per click, since Google will attempt to spend your 
budget.
If you consider your keywords to have different values for your company, you 
should not use the Budget Optimizer. For instance, if you are willing to pay $4 per 
click for the keyword Samsung 63 Plasma TV but only $2 for the keyword Plasma TV, 
you should not use the Budget Optimizer. If you are looking to maximize traffic, how-
ever, it can be useful.
There’s another reason to use the Budget Optimizer. Suppose you have key-
words that are good words for your industry and you want to have some exposure on 
searches that use them. However, those words are so early in the buying funnel that 
you do not see returns on searches that use them. In this case, you can put the early 
buying funnel keywords in a Budget Optimizer campaign with a branding budget 
and then let AdWords maximize your traffic. For the other keywords for which you 
are receiving conversions and want to control the bids, leave them in a max CPC or 
Conversion Optimizer campaign.
If you use both a Budget Optimizer and a max CPC campaign to separate key-
words based on where they are in the buying funnel, make sure that the max CPC set 
for the Budget Optimizer campaign is lower than the max CPCs you are setting in your 
max CPC–based campaign. If your Budget Optimizer campaign uses broad match 
keywords and has higher bids than your ROAS-based campaign, a Budget Optimizer 
ad could be shown instead of your ROAS-based ad. Since the Budget Optimizer ad is 
meant to get someone to enter your funnel, its value is less for someone who is already 
in the buying funnel who searches for a keyword in your max CPC campaign. Hence, 
you should never pay more for a Budget Optimizer keyword to show instead of a max 
CPC keyword where you are bidding on an ROI or profit basis.
In addition, when you use Budget Optimizer, your goal should not just be to get 
the most clicks possible; it should be to get the best clicks possible. To measure a good 
versus a bad click in this sense, it is useful to connect Google Analytics to AdWords 
so that you can measure bounce rates and time on site for each of these keywords. If 
you have keywords that lead to 100 percent bounce rates, they are not helping you to 
spread your brand and awareness. If your words have 25 percent bounce rates, then 
you are receiving clicks that are leading to good interaction on your website. 
Enhanced CPC
Enhanced CPC bidding is not a standalone bid type. It is an optional setting when you 
are using either of the Focus On Clicks bid methods. With Enhanced CPC, Google will 
adjust your bids based on the likelihood of a conversion. Google may raise your CPC 
by 30 percent above your max CPC or lower your CPC by up to 100 percent. Because 
Google can raise your CPC by up to 30 percent above your max CPC, it is possible 
that your average CPC will be higher than your max CPC.

■  Ex plor i ng A dWor ds Bi ddi ng Op t ions
437
If your overall goal is conversions and you wish to bid manually, this setting 
should help you increase your overall conversion rates. I have seen Enhanced CPC do 
very good things for accounts, and I’ve also see it fail on occasion. Do not just blindly 
turn on this setting and walk away. If you wish to try it out, turn it on for a couple 
weeks and see if your overall profits are increasing. If they are, leave the setting on. If 
your profits are not increasing, turn this setting off. 
Conversion Optimizer
Focus On Conversions is known as the Conversion Optimizer. To enable the 
Conversion Optimizer, the campaign must be using the AdWords conversion-tracking 
script or importing goals through Google Analytics and must have at least 15 conver-
sions in the past 30 days.
If you meet the criteria and want to use the Conversion Optimizer, you will 
enter a cost per action (CPA) for each ad group. AdWords will adjust the bids for your 
keywords in an attempt to meet your cost per action. You will still be charged on a 
cost-per-click basis. You will not just pay for actions. However, AdWords has access to 
many data points that you don’t, and they will use this information, along with other 
information gathered, to manipulate your bids to try to maximize the conversions you 
receive for your target CPA. Unfortunately, you cannot enter different CPAs for dif-
ferent conversions you have defined. For instance, in the earlier plumber example, the 
plumber was willing to pay different prices for a phone call that led to a small job ver-
sus a kitchen remodeling job. However, with the Conversion Optimizer, you can define 
only a single CPA. Therefore, you might have to separate keywords into different cam-
paigns based on your goals. For instance, the plumber could put the kitchen remodel-
ing keywords in one campaign with a CPA of $100 and the pipe repair keywords in 
another campaign with a CPA of $25.
Google used to offer two options for CPA bidding: target CPA and max CPA. 
Google retired the max CPA setting in Q1 2014. At the moment, Google has the option 
to use target CPA or max CPA. Target CPA is a blended average of all your costs per 
conversion. For instance, if your target CPA is $20, then your actual CPAs might be 
$15 for one conversion and $25 for another one. These two conversions average to 
your target CPA of $20.
Max CPA is the most you should pay for any conversions. In this example, if 
your max CPA was $20, then you should receive the conversion that cost $15 since that 
is under the maximum amount you want to pay for a conversion, but you should not 
receive the $25 conversion since that is above your max CPA target.
Google is planning on sunsetting max CPA bidding by the end of Q1 2014, so 
odds are that you will no longer see this feature and all CPA bidding will be based on 
target CPAs in the future. 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
438
1-per-Click vs. Many-per-Click CPA Bidding
When you use conversion tracking with AdWords, you have two types of conversion 
metrics to work from, 1-per-click and many-per-click. 
1-per-click conversions are unique conversions per user. If someone comes to 
your site and converts four times, on either the same goal or different goals, they will 
be considered just one 1-per-click conversion.
Many-per-click conversions are the total number of conversions for the site. If a 
user comes to your site and converts four times, then they will be four many-per-click 
conversions. Many-per-click conversions are useful when you have many repeat pur-
chases in a small time frame or one of your goals is page views per visit, which is com-
mon for publishers to measure. 
The downside of many-per-click is that in some cases, a single user can dramati-
cally inflate this number. For instance, take a scenario where a user fills out a form to 
get access to a whitepaper that you wrote. After the form is filled out, you trigger the 
AdWords conversion script and the user can download the whitepaper. What some-
times happens is the user downloads the whitepaper and starts to read it, but then they 
get distracted at work and close the whitepaper and their browser. Later, they want to 
continue reading the whitepaper, so they reopen their browser, and the browser fetches 
your conversion page again as it reloads the last tabs that were open when the browser 
was closed, which in turn triggers another conversion to be recorded. This can happen 
many times, so there are times when you could see a single 1-per-click conversion and 
20 many-per-click conversions. If you see these large discrepancies, it is worth investi-
gating, but there might not be a data issue; it could be based on user behavior.
By default, CPA bidding is based on 1-per-click conversions. However, if you 
edit the settings of your conversion script, you can choose to have CPA bidding work 
off of your many-per-click data (Figure 13.10).
Figure 13.10  Choosing the type of conversions for CPA bidding
Testing CPA Bidding
Many companies have found great success with the Conversion Optimizer; however, 
the biggest drawback some companies find is that while the Conversion Optimizer 

■  Ex plor i ng A dWor ds Bi ddi ng Op t ions
439
hits their target CPA, their total conversions drop. Therefore, if you want to test the 
Conversion Optimizer but do not want to turn over your entire budget to it, follow 
these steps:
	 1.	
Use the AdWords Editor to duplicate the campaign you want to test.
	 2.	
Split your budget between the two campaigns. If you are an aggressive tester, 
give the new campaign half your budget. If you are a conservative tester, give it a 
quarter or less of your budget.
	 3.	
In the new campaign, set max CPC bids and try to maximize your conversions.
	 4.	
In the old campaign, turn on the Conversion Optimizer and let Google take over 
your bidding.
	 5.	
After a few weeks, see which has better results.
If you have a campaign that is doing very well right now, instead of turning on 
the Conversion Optimizer in your established campaign, wait for the new campaign 
to reach at least 15 conversions and then test the optimizer in the new campaign. This 
strategy will help mitigate the risk of putting your current profits in jeopardy if the 
Conversion Optimizer does not perform well for your campaigns.
This is one of the few times when it is OK to compete with yourself. Rarely do 
you want to let Google choose which keyword they should show from your account. 
Much of optimizing AdWords is taking control from Google so you know that when 
someone does a search they will see the exact combination of a keyword, ad, and des-
tination URL you choose. In this case, you are testing bidding methods that can be 
set only at the campaign level. Therefore, it is okay to compete with yourself for a few 
weeks until you can determine which bidding methodology will work best.
CPA Bidding Case Study
When Google first launched CPA bidding, you needed at least 300 conversions to turn 
it on. That number was lowered several times to where you need only 15 conversions 
in the previous month to enable it today. However, over the past few years, it has very 
rarely worked for small accounts that were generating under 30–50 conversions per 
month. That has changed in the past year, and I want to show a case study of how even 
small accounts can take advantage of CPA bidding.
I was working on an account where most campaigns were averaging 15–20 con-
versions per month. The data was sporadic and inconsistent. One month, certain words 
would get a conversion, and the next month, a completely different set of words would 
get a conversion.
There were very few words that would receive a conversion every single month, 
and the words that did have these consistent conversions were often higher than the 
target CPA for the account. Figure 13.11 shows the account’s typical month.

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
440
Figure 13.11  Typical small account data
The target CPA was $65 per conversion. Only one campaign exceeded this CPA. 
Every single other campaign was significantly higher than this goal. 
To optimize the account, the first step was to take all the data and create a very 
granular organized campaign that used the best features of the data from the past 
several years. This was to be a benchmark campaign of what was possible. This is the 
type of organization that is mentioned throughout this book and concentrated on in 
Chapter 7, “Demystifying Quality Score.”
Some of the other campaigns had high CPCs but were working well enough, so 
some minor tweaks were made in other campaigns, but most of the work was done in 
this new experimental campaign. Just by creating well-organized ad groups, the total 
conversions increased from 50 to 112 (Figure 13.12) in the first month of managing the 
account.
In the second month, some minor tweaks were made; but the biggest change 
was turning on CPA bidding for a few campaigns. Once CPA bidding was enabled, 
the conversion rates went up by 0.7 percent, which is a nice but not huge increase. The 
CTR dropped a touch, which is not uncommon to see since some bids are decreased if 
Google does not think that click will convert. However, the total conversions increased 
by 40 with a $10 reduction in CPA.
That’s what CPA bidding can often do for smaller accounts. No longer are the 
conversions hovering at the 15–20 range where you might not be able to use CPA bid-
ding, but they have increased enough to where Google does have more data to work 
with in making bid decisions (Figure 13.13).

Figure 13.12  The campaigns after some basic organization was fixed
Figure 13.13  The campaigns after CPA bidding was enabled
In the third month, the major change was enabling the ad-serving option 
Optimize For Conversions, which is detailed in Chapter 15, “Implementing Testing 
Techniques That Will Increase Profits.” This setting tells Google that if you have 
multiple ads in an ad group to serve the ad that has the highest conversion rate the 
most. There were some other changes, such as adding negatives, removing some poor-
performing words, testing extensions, and so forth; but the largest change was the ad 
serving. 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
442
The ad-delivery setting Optimize For Conversions had an unexpected result—
it not only increased the conversion rates; it increased the CTR in a few campaigns 
(Figure 13.14). 
Figure 13.14  Ad-delivery setting Optimize For Conversions increased CTR.
The well-organized campaign amazingly went from a 5.64 percent CTR to a 
10 percent CTR with Optimize For Conversions. Other campaigns increased in CTRs 
as well, but not to quite the same levels. While this might seem counterintuitive that 
Optimize For Conversions would raise CTRs, what happens is that CPA bidding raises 
the bids when it expects certain words to get the clicks so that the average position 
also increases, which increases the CTRs with it. When CPA bidding does not think a 
click can lead to a conversion, it might not bid for the click at all, which means that it 
cannot lower your CTR since there is no impression recorded. It is not uncommon to 
see CPA bidding in conjunction with the Optimize For Conversion setting to raise the 
overall CTRs of an account. However, it does not always happen and should not be an 
expected outcome; it is a nice-to-see side effect.
In addition, the overall conversion rates went from 3.24 percent to 5.09 percent 
with the well-organized campaign, or New Campaign, going from a 2.97 percent to a 
4.99 percent conversion rate. That’s a very nice increase since it takes only 30 seconds 
to change the ad-rotation setting from one option to another.
The other dramatic change was that the PLA campaign went from a 5.77 per-
cent conversion rate to an 11.30 percent conversion rate. That’s an amazing difference 
in a PLA campaign where very little work is being done on the management side.
These are the overall results of one good campaign (the other campaigns weren’t 
touched outside of some basic items such as adding negative keywords and manipulat-
ing the budgets) and using the Conversion Optimizer during a 90-day period: 

■  Ex plor i ng A dWor ds Bi ddi ng Op t ions
443
••
Conversion rates: Increased from 1.94 percent to 5.09 percent
••
CPA: Decreased from $101 to $44 
••
CTR: Increased from 3.21 percent to 3.46 percent
••
Total budget: Increased $4,600 
••
Total conversions: Increased from 50 to 216 per month
The next steps would be to reorganize the other campaigns as well to follow the 
same logic as the well-organized campaign and to continue to work on the account. 
However, this is what CPA bidding can do for campaigns, large or small, when you 
have good organization and a well-managed account. 
Automated Rules
AdWords supports some automated bid rules so that you do not have to keep making the same 
changes over and over again. For instance, you can set up a rule to change your bid by +10 percent if 
your CPA is below $20 and to change your bid downward by –10 percent if your CPA is above $30. 
You can change ad group or keywords bids; pause or enable campaigns, keywords, or ads; and even 
change daily budgets with the automated rules.
Focus on Impressions
The first three bidding methodologies can be used on both the search and the Display 
Networks. However, this option will be available only if your campaign is set to 
the Display Network. When you choose Focus On Impressions, you are setting cost 
per thousand impressions (CPM) bids. Please refer to the “Choosing CPM or CPC 
Bidding” section in Chapter 9, “Understanding the Display Network,” to learn more 
about CPM bidding methods.
With these first few bid strategies, every ad group in the campaign will use that 
particular strategy. However, there is an option to allow you to set a different strategy 
for each ad group known as Flexible Bidding. 
Flexible Bidding
Flexible Bidding allows you to use different bid strategies for campaigns, ad groups, 
and keywords. Before you can enable this bid system, you must first create a bid strat-
egy in the Shared Library, Bid Strategy section (Figure 13.15), that is the default for the 
campaign.
Once you have created at least one strategy, then you can enable Flexible Bidding. 
The reason you must first create one before you can enable this bid type is you will 
choose one that is the default for the campaign. This default strategy will be used for 
your ad groups if you do not enable a different strategy for an ad group. 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
444
Figure 13.15  Creating a bid strategy
Two of the bid strategies, Enhanced CPC and Maximize Clicks (which used to 
be known as the Budget Optimizer), work as a flexible strategy the same way for ad 
groups and campaigns. The only difference is that with Flexible Bidding you can have 
one ad group that uses Maximize Clicks and another ad group that uses manual CPC 
bidding with Enhanced CPC enabled.
With the other strategies, you will first define them. Second, you can apply them 
to one or more ad groups. If you change the settings within the strategy, then every ad 
group that uses that strategy will also use the new settings.
For instance, you can create multiple Target CPA strategies. When you define 
each strategy you will set your Target CPA for that particular strategy (Figure 13.16).
Figure 13.16  Creating a Target CPA strategy 
First, select the ad groups that you want to apply that bid strategy to and 
click the Bid Strategies button. Next, select the bid strategy for those ad groups 
(Figure 13.17).

■  Ex plor i ng A dWor ds Bi ddi ng Op t ions
445
Figure 13.17  Applying a bid strategy to an ad group 
Now, if you were to go back to the strategy and change the CPA within the 
settings, every ad group that uses that strategy would now target the new CPA. This 
makes it easy to switch the goals of many ad groups at once; however, it also makes it 
easy to mistakenly change an ad group’s targets if you are not fully aware of the bid 
strategy that an ad group is using. While Target CPA was used in this example, when-
ever a strategy is applied to an ad group, if the strategy’s settings are changed, every ad 
group that uses that strategy will also use the new settings.
Target Search Page Location
Another flexible bid type you can use helps you target a specific search page location 
(Figure 13.18).
With this bidding strategy, you can have the bids automatically adjusted to tar-
get the top of a search page or have the bids adjusted so that your ad appears on the 
first page of search results. 
There are several settings you can choose when using this strategy.
Location  The first choice is whether you want the bids changed so that your ad appears 
at the top of the page (above the organic results) or have the bids changed so that the 
ad appears anywhere on page 1 of the search results.
Bid Automation  The second choice determines if all the bids will be managed automati-
cally by the AdWords system or if you want to set the bids yourself, but AdWords will 
manipulate them to hit your desired page location. 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
446
Figure 13.18  Target Search Page Location 
Bid Adjustment  This option allows you to raise or lower your bid by a percentage after 
the system has set your bid. For instance, if you are targeting the first page of results, 
you might not want your ad to be at the bottom of the page where it has little visibil-
ity. In this case, you could have AdWords set the first page bid for you and then raise 
your bid by another 20 percent so that your ad will most likely appear in the middle of 
the right rail. Another option is to target the top of the page, but you might not want 
to pay for the top position all the time, so you could then lower the bid by 10 percent 
after the top bid is set.
Max CPC Bid Limit  This is the highest bid that AdWords will set for your keywords. While 
this is an optional setting, it should always be utilized so that you do not have sudden 
surprises in how much you paid for a few clicks. On occasion, there will be advertisers 
who set very high bids, and if the automated system is trying to jump over those bids to 
meet your rules, you could end up paying a lot more per click than you are comfortable 
with, so always set a max bid cap.
Limited Budgets  If a campaign cannot show all day long because its budget is too low, the 
campaign is marked as Limited By Budget, which means that if you raised your budget 
you would get more traffic. This setting allows you to not have the bid rules run when 
your campaign is limited by budget since by increasing your bids you will just receive 
less traffic. Your CPC will increase, but since your budget is already being depleted, 
you will end up with fewer clicks for the same budget. 

■  Ex plor i ng A dWor ds Bi ddi ng Op t ions
447
Low Quality Keywords  This option allows you to not have bid rules run on low-quality key-
words. While this option is on by default, there are many times when you will want to 
run these rules on low-quality keywords, such as when you are in an industry that typi-
cally has low-quality keywords. 
Target Search Page Location is a good strategy when you are looking to control 
your overall exposure and you are more concerned with your ad’s visibility than with 
conversions. If conversions are important to you, then you should use a different bid 
method that examines conversion data or uses ROAS bidding.
ROAS Bid Strategy
ROAS bidding, also known as return on ad spend, is a bid option where AdWords 
will try to set bids based on your overall ROAS goals. Before you can use this system, 
you will want to ensure that your revenue data is being imported into AdWords either 
through a Google Analytics implementation or using the advanced options in the 
AdWords conversion-tracking script, or you at least have a conversion value defined in 
your conversion settings. 
If you have values associated with your conversions, then you can create a ROAS 
bid strategy (Figure 13.19).
With ROAS bidding, you first need to name the bid type and define your tar-
get ROAS. We will cover ROAS calculations in this chapter in the section “ROAS vs. 
Profit.” 
Figure 13.19  ROAS bidding options 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
448
You then have the option to set max and min bids for your keywords. While 
these are both optional, it is a good idea to set both of these items. For instance, if you 
have a word that gets one click at a $1 cost and then sells an item for $100, you might 
suddenly see the bid for that keyword skyrocket because that keyword has 10,000 per-
cent ROAS; odds are that the next click will not also sell another item for $100. 
Conversely, it is often a good idea to set a minimum bid. If you do not set a 
minimum bid, then it is easy for a bid system to start setting bids to $0 for keywords 
that do not convert over time. If you are selling expensive luxury items, you might be 
happy with a 0.25 percent conversion rate. However, at that conversion rate it takes 
400 clicks on average to receive one conversion. Often a bid system will set the bids to 
$0 before you receive your first conversion for that keyword so that the system can bid 
appropriately. 
It is generally better for you to examine the keywords that do not convert and 
remove them from the system manually than to rely on a bid system to just bid noncon-
verting keywords to $0, unless you have some rules in place for how many clicks a key-
word should receive before it gives up on a keyword. Those types of additional controls 
do not exist within flexible bidding. 
In most cases, a brand-new account will start with manual CPC bidding so that 
you can gather data about your keywords and conversion rates before you can enable 
other bid strategies such as CPA bidding that have some minimum requirements. So, 
next we will examine how to set manual bids and some formulas that you should be 
familiar with when advertising. 
Profitable Bidding Strategies
If you are using max CPC bidding, you need to set your own bids. We will walk 
through some strategies for setting bids. There are a few different places in your 
account where you can set bids:
••
Ad group 
••
Ad group for display
••
Keyword
••
Auto targets (for shopping and PLAs)
••
Placement interests and remarketing
••
Topic age
••
Gender
The ad group–level bids are the default bids. You can override these bids by also 
bidding by keyword for search or by interest, topic, or placement for display. Google 
will use the most specific bid. 

■  Prof i ta ble Bi ddi ng St r at egi e s
449
For instance, if you have both a keyword-level bid and an ad group–level bid, 
the keyword is more specific, so Google will use that one. If you have an ad group bid 
and a placement bid, Google will use the placement bid if someone is on that placement 
because it is more specific. If you have placements but you have not set bids for each 
placement, Google will use the default ad group bid when there is no placement bid.
To maximize your bidding control, use specific bids at the keyword and place-
ment levels. If you have a number of ad groups, you can just set ad group–level bids 
and not keyword-level bids. However, you might find that similar keywords in the 
same ad group lead to different returns for your ad spend. While you can take the 
shortcut of setting ad group bids instead of keyword bids, if you want to maximize 
your bidding strategies, you should use keyword-level bids.
Often on the Display Network you will have an ad group for each topic or inter-
est you are targeting. If the ad group has only a single way of showing your ads (that is, 
the ad group has only a single topic or single interest in it), then there is no need to set 
both ad group– and targeting-level bids.
Regardless of where you decide to set bids, these strategies apply to any of the 
places you want to set bids.
ROAS vs. Profit
In several of your bidding strategies, to set bids you will use a return on investment cal-
culation specific to the advertising industry called return on ad spend (ROAS). However, 
keep in mind that maximizing your ROAS does not always maximize your profits. 
ROAS vs. ROI
Return on investment (ROI) has been long misused in search. The true formula for ROI is  
ROI = (revenue – cost) / cost.
This formula has been warped by many marketers into ROI = revenue / cost. They choose to use this 
incorrect formula because ROI can be a negative number, and negative numbers make bid calculations 
more complex. A 100 percent ROI in the incorrect formula is your breakeven point, so calculations 
become easy. The simple explanation for this is that since you are calculating marketing costs, you just 
removed those same costs from the formula to calculate ROI.
When search marketing was primarily conducted by non-marketing people in the early years when 
the web designer or IT department often ran paid search, this slight change in definition often did not 
matter to the company. But since search has grown into a multibillion-dollar business and is being 
taught in college marketing classes, an effort must be made to correct the use of these terms so that it 
is consistent between company departments.
The ROAS formula is ROAS = revenue / advertising cost. The ROAS formula is the same as the warped 
or incorrect ROI formula used in search. Therefore, in this chapter you will use ROAS in your calcula-
tions to determine bids.

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
450
ROAS is easy to calculate. The formula is ROAS = revenue / cost.
A 100 percent ROAS is breaking even if you have 100 percent margins, which 
is common when you do not have physical goods. If you are selling products, then a 
100 percent ROAS means that you are losing the cost of the product, and potentially 
shipping, on each sale. A 200 percent ROAS means for every dollar you spend, you 
bring in two dollars of revenue. A 50 percent ROAS means for every dollar you spend, 
you bring in only 50 cents. In other words, a 50 percent ROAS means you are losing 
money. 
For example, let’s examine a company that sells both chocolates and flowers. 
Chocolates are less competitive than flowers, and therefore the CPC is lower. However, 
flowers have a higher average order value than chocolates, and therefore the potential 
for more profits exists. As Table 13.1 illustrates, higher ROAS does not always mean 
more profits. In this example, let us assume that both of the products cost the same, so 
we will ignore the additional calculation of the cost of goods in order to easily show 
the concept without getting buried in math and additional equations. In most cases, 
you would also want to factor in the cost of goods, shipping, and other hard-cost 
expenses before determining profit.

In this example, the chocolate campaign has a higher ROAS than flowers. Many 
companies would consider this the more successful campaign. However, the flow-
ers campaign brings in more total profits each time it makes a sale. Other companies 
would consider this to be the more successful campaign. The success metrics can be 
correlated with your original goals, which can be modified whenever you learn more 
about your business or change your business direction.
ROAS is an easy number to work with, and you will use it in several of your 
calculations in this chapter. However, never forget to calculate profit. I will show you a 
bidding strategy that focuses purely on profit.
Revenue per Click
Each time you attain a final business goal, there is revenue associated with the goal. 
With AdWords, you also pay each time someone clicks on your ad. Each click usually 
does not lead to revenue. It is a bundle of clicks that finally results in a conversion that 

■  Prof i ta ble Bi ddi ng St r at egi e s
451
leads to company revenues. When thinking about how much you should bid on a click, 
first calculate your breakeven point, which you can easily determine by the metric rev-
enue per click.
Determining Revenue per Click
To calculate revenue per click, simply divide the revenue that a keyword, placement, or 
ad group brought to your company by the number of clicks that same ad group, key-
word, or placement received.
If a keyword received 100 clicks that led to $1,000 of revenue, then the revenue 
per click is $10 ($1,000 / 100 = $10).
If you are using AdWords conversion tracking and have associated revenue num-
bers with conversions, you can easily gather this data from AdWords. When you cus-
tomize columns, add the column Conv. Value / Click (Figure 13.20).
Figure 13.20  Include Conv. Value / Click when running AdWords reports.
Google will then divide how much revenue a data point received (for AdWords, 
this could be ad, ad group, keyword, campaign, placements, and so on) by the number 
of clicks that same data point received. Understanding your value per click will help 
you gain insight into your marketing effectiveness. It is one of the best metrics to work 
with inside your account.
To simplify the explanations, you will look only at keywords throughout the 
next several reports and mathematical calculations. However, please note that instead 
of keywords, these reports could be showing you data at the placement, ad group, 
landing page, and other levels.
In addition, we will not consider the cost of goods, shipping, and other calcula-
tions that can be added to determine these numbers. We will work with 100 percent 
margins to make the illustration of the match and thought process easier. However, 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
452
if you are selling goods, adding a step to these processes to calculate margins and the 
prices of goods is a useful exercise when possible. 
Once you download the keyword report including the value-per-click informa-
tion, you should have an Excel file that shows your keywords, the number of clicks, 
conversions, total value, and value per click for those items (Figure 13.21).
Figure 13.21  Excel report showing keyword value-per-click data
Clarifying Data with Conditional Formatting
If you have a large account, this is the point where you can easily become overwhelmed 
by data. There is another Excel function, called conditional formatting, that can turn 
large spreadsheets into visual references.
The basic use of conditional formatting allows you to highlight cells if they meet 
certain conditions. To use conditional formatting in Excel 2007 or later versions, on 
the Home tab of the ribbon, click Conditional Formatting and choose the type of rule 
you want to create (Figure 13.22). Then select the cells and the formatting you want to 
apply to those cells.
Figure 13.22  Creating conditional formatting rules

■  Prof i ta ble Bi ddi ng St r at egi e s
453
Use these conditional formatting rules to create a visual reference to see how 
various keywords, ad groups, and placements are performing:
Red  The value per click is lower than the average CPC. The first rule you should cre-
ate is to determine where you are losing money. Since value per click is your breakeven 
point, if your average cost per click is higher than your value per click, every time you 
receive a click, you lose money.
Orange  The estimated first page bid is higher than the value per click. To receive first-
page exposure across all geographies where you are advertising, your maximum cost 
per click needs to be higher than the first-page bid. When the value per click is lower 
than your first-page bid estimate, these keywords can never be on page 1 profitably. 
This is a good place to do some testing to see if you can raise the value of those key-
words, or if you are examining geographic data, to take a look at the areas where you 
are not doing well so you can find new ways of marketing in that region.
Yellow  The value per click is higher than the average CPC but lower than the max 
CPC. When your value per click is higher than your average CPC, you make money 
on each click. However, if your value per click is also lower than your max CPC, you 
could start to lose money on this keyword without changing the bid. These keywords 
need to be watched to see if they start losing you money. They are also good keywords 
to test to see if you can raise the value per click by testing different ad copy and landing 
pages.
Brown  The value per click is higher than the average CPC and first page bid estimate, 
but the max CPC is below the first page bid estimate. These are words that are profit-
able because the value per click is higher than the average CPC. These words would 
also be profitable on page 1 since the value per click is higher than the first page bid. 
However, because the max CPC is below the first-page bid, these words are not receiv-
ing first-page exposure. These are good words on which to bid so that they receive page 
1 exposure since they will be profitable at those positions. 
Green  The value per click is higher than the max CPC, and the max CPC is higher 
than the first page bid. These keywords are on page 1 and are making you money. You 
might adjust the bids so they receive more exposure or set bids based on ROAS.
By using these conditional formatting rules, you can transform large spread-
sheets into visual reference charts that allow you to understand how your keywords, 
ads, landing pages, ad groups, or placements are performing.
Taking Margins into Account
Value per click takes only total revenue into account. This metric does not take mar-
gins into account. If you have hard costs, such as an e-commerce company that has to 
buy the products they are selling, you need to move beyond value per click to look at 
profit per click.

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
454
If you run a lead-generation company without hard costs of goods, your value 
per click is usually your profit per click. That means you do not need to perform any 
additional calculations.
There are a few ways to take margins into account so that you are setting bids 
based on actual profits. The most accurate method is to use Google’s API or a third-
party vendor to incorporate your back-end system with AdWords so that you can see 
exactly which keywords are selling which products and then determine the margins 
automatically. This is the most accurate solution, although it is can be a costly solution. 
Let’s take a look at a lower-tech approach that any company, regardless of budget, can 
incorporate.
First, make sure that your ad groups consist of closely related keywords. Create 
ad groups that promote only a specific product or closely related products with similar 
margins. For instance, let’s assume you sell the products shown in Table 13.2.
▶
▶Table 13.2  Calculating margins
Keyword
Margin
iPod nano
25%
iPod touch
35%
Coby Video Player
30%
SanDisk Sansa
20%
Sony Walkman
20%
Your best organization would be to group each of these keywords and their 
closely related variations (such as pink iPod nano, 8GB iPod nano) together to form ad 
groups. However, if you have a tremendous number of items, that organization is not 
always possible. In that case, the only two items you should combine into a single ad 
group would be the SanDisk Sansa and the Sony Walkman because they have the same 
margins.
Note:  From a conversion rate standpoint, this is not a good organization; you would want different ad copy 
and landing pages for these products. This example is for illustration purposes only, so you can see how to incorpo-
rate margins into your reports.
To create reports that include margin data, follow these steps:
	 1.	
Make a list of all your ad groups in Excel. The easiest way to get such a list is to 
run an ad group report or export your account from the AdWords Editor.
	 2.	
In another column, list your margins for the product that the ad group should 
sell, just like in Table 13.2.

■  Prof i ta ble Bi ddi ng St r at egi e s
455
	 3.	
When you run a report from AdWords, add a new column for margins. Then 
incorporate your margin data into the AdWords report using the VLookUp 
function.
	 4.	
Create an additional column called Profit Per Click, and populate this column by 
multiplying your value per click by your margin (Figure 13.23).
Figure 13.23  Taking margins into account when examining performance
	 5.	
Finally, use the conditional formatting rules on the Profit Per Click column 
instead of the Value / Click column. This will give you a visual reference of your 
actual profits.
Instead of applying margins at the ad group level, you could incorporate mar-
gins at the keyword level. However, determining your margins for each keyword could 
consume so many hours of work that it might be cheaper to incorporate your back-end 
system into a third-party vendor or use the AdWords API.
This low-tech approach should be directionally accurate. However, what you 
will find is that some of your sales are for completely unrelated items. You will find 
that someone searches for an iPod and buys a plasma TV—or someone searches for a 
plasma TV and buys a 10-cent pencil. Using this margin approach is better than not 
understanding how your profits are derived whatsoever, but the results will be inaccu-
rate at times.
How Can Publishers Determine Revenue per Click?
The metric that publishers, such as newspapers, should track is revenue per visitor 
(RPV). Sometimes RPV is calculated by individual user, and other times by 1,000 visi-
tors, similar to CPM.

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■

Most publishers have two main revenue opportunities. One is to sell ads on their 
site and the second is to sell subscriptions. To calculate your revenue per visitor, you 
first need to find how much you make on any page view.
For instance, if a publisher sells $50 CPM ads (meaning an advertiser is will-
ing to pay $50 for 1,000 page views), then each individual page view is worth $0.05 
($50 / 1,000). If a publisher has three ad display units on a page, the page view is actu-
ally worth $0.15.
Once you understand how much you make on any single page view, the sec-
ond step is to calculate average page views per visit. For our analysis, let’s assume the 
average visitor sees three pages. By multiplying the average page views (3) by the RPV 
($0.15), you can see that by getting a visitor to the site, the publisher makes $0.45. 
Average page views will vary by traffic source and by keyword.
The second metric publishers track is subscriptions. For ease of analysis, let’s 
assume that one out of every 100 visitors buys a subscription for $10 per month. A sub-
scription is not a one-time purchase. A publisher should then track how long someone 
is paying for a subscription. Our example newspaper finds that when someone buys a 
subscription, that user pays the newspaper for 10 months. Therefore, a one-time sale is 
actually a $100 lifetime value. At a 1 percent conversion rate, that means the publisher 
makes $1 per visitor ($100 purchase × 1 percent conversion rate) when tracking sub-
scription revenue.
Combining RPV and Subscription Revenue
You can take this approach even further and look at the number of page views per sub-
scriber per month. For ease of calculation, let’s say our newspaper finds that subscrib-
ers see 100 page views per month. When you calculate RPV ($0.15) times page views 
per month (100) times the number of months someone is a subscriber (10), you find 
that the actual subscriber is worth $150 over their lifetime. This is the lifetime RPV.
Adding the lifetime RPV ($150) to the lifetime subscription value ($100), you 
end up with a $250 product. Since only 1 percent of searchers buy a subscription, the 
actual value per click for subscription conversions is $2.50: $250 (product value) × 1 
percent (conversion rate) = $2.50.
When you add the original RPV ($0.45) and the lifetime subscription price value 
per click ($2.50) of each visitor, you see that the newspaper on average makes $2.95 
per visitor. Therefore, $2.95 is their actual lifetime value per click of a nonsubscriber. 
The value per click of a current subscriber is only the RPV ($0.45) since you cannot sell 
them a product they already own (the subscription). Within AdWords you cannot tar-
get nonsubscribers, so the best the publisher can do is to use a blended average for their 
profit per click.
That value-per-click number represents all keywords and traffic sources com-
bined. A publisher might find that one keyword leads to 10 page views per visit but no 

■  Prof i ta ble Bi ddi ng St r at egi e s
457
subscriptions. Another keyword might lead to a 10 percent subscription rate but only 
three page views. To set bids at the ad group, keyword, display, and placement level, 
you will want to be able to calculate those values for each data point.
Tracking Page View Conversions in AdWords
The easiest ways to view this data in AdWords so that you can see value per click by 
keyword, landing page, and ad is to use the AdWords conversion tracker or Google 
Analytics. If you do this with the AdWords script, set up one script that tracks page 
views. In the Value column, enter $0.15 (the value per page view). Put this script on 
each page of your website. Then set up a second script that goes on the “Thank you for 
subscribing” page. In the subscription script, for the total value enter $250, the lifetime 
value of a subscriber.
Technically, the most accurate number would come from tracking average sub-
scription length and page views per subscriber by traffic source to adjust that $250 life-
time value appropriately based on actual data. To get to that level of tracking, you will 
need to incorporate your own tracking system—that information cannot be gathered 
from AdWords or Google Analytics alone. However, this is a good place to start to 
examine how profitable each keyword or placement is to your bottom line.
Once you have incorporated these tracking scripts, when you run an AdWords 
report you can see the revenue associated with each keyword as a publisher. In the sec-
tion “Calculating Your Max CPC,” later in this chapter, you will use this revenue per 
click number to set appropriate bids for each keyword, ad group, or placement based 
on actual revenue.
Tracking Long Sales Cycles with Conversion Funnels
Many companies do not make a final sale off their first conversion activity. If you are 
in a business-to-business environment or selling high-end products, you may find that 
it takes several contacts with a user before you finally sell a product. In cases of mul-
tiple touch points, you need to build a conversion funnel to understand what each key-
word and lead is worth to your company.
Let’s look at a fictional company called RSI, which integrates Android mobile 
devices with Microsoft Exchange and a company’s internal instant messaging desktop 
applications. This is a complex procedure, and their service is expensive; their average 
enterprise customer spends $100,000 per integration. RSI finds that they never make 
a sale from a single phone call. They need multiple touch points to move a corporation 
through the buying funnel before the customer finally signs a contract and writes them 
a check.
After some analysis, RSI builds a conversion funnel with five steps:
	 1.	
Buy clicks to their website from AdWords.

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
458
	 2.	
Offer those searchers a free whitepaper download. To receive the download, 
users must enter their contact information.
	 3.	
Invite everyone who downloads their whitepaper to a free webinar that show-
cases their product.
	 4.	
Call each person who attended their webinar to attempt to sell them a product.
	 5.	
Make a final sale for $100,000.
RSI exists for illustration purposes only; you may find that you need to add more 
steps to your own conversion funnel, such as in-person demos.
RSI tracks the conversion rates from clicks to whitepaper downloads. Since that 
action occurs on the Web, they can easily use the AdWords conversion tracking to see 
the percentage of downloads by keyword or placement to determine how much they 
are paying for a download. However, a download does not lead to revenues for the 
company; it just introduces a searcher to their buying funnel. Therefore, RSI needs to 
do some math and offline tracking to determine what an actual click is worth.
Buy clicks to their website from AdWords.  RSI finds that they are currently paying an average 
of $10 a click from AdWords. They can do this entire analysis at the keyword, land-
ing page, or placement level. For now, let’s keep it simple to illustrate how to analyze 
a conversion funnel. RSI buys 1,000 clicks at $10 a click, so their initial investment is 
$10,000.
Offer those searchers a free whitepaper download.  RSI’s whitepaper download conversion rate 
is a fantastic 25 percent. Of those 1,000 clicks, they have received 250 downloads. 
Therefore, they have paid $40 per download ($10,000 / 250 = $40).
Invite everyone who downloads their whitepaper to a free webinar.  It seems that those who like a 
free download also like free webinars. Forty percent of those who download the white-
paper attend RSI’s webinar. They receive 100 viewers of their webinar (250 downloads 
× 40 percent conversion rate). They have essentially paid $100 to have someone attend 
their webinar ($10,000 in clicks / 100 attendees).
Call each person who attended their webinar to attempt to sell them a product.  The sales team man-
ages to get 10 percent of the webinar attendees on the phone. The cost per phone call 
contact is $1,000 ($10,000 in clicks / 10 phone calls = $1,000).
Make a final sale for $100,000.  Of those 10 phone calls, the sales team makes one sale for 
$100,000. Now that they have a sale, they can finally calculate the ROI of that sale 
and the value per click. ROI is profit / spend; in this case, $100,000 profit / $10,000 
spend = 1,000 percent ROI. Although most e-commerce companies would love a 
1,000 percent ROI, often in a B2B environment that ROI is necessary, because you 
have a large team making a single sale based on the customer touch points.
RSI is a savvy company, so they do not automatically assume that their ROAS is actu-
ally 1,000 percent. They do some math and realize that, based on the time invested 

■  Prof i ta ble Bi ddi ng St r at egi e s
459
in paying sales reps, emailing customers, and conducting webinars, as well as build-
ing, installing, and supporting the RSI system, the fully loaded cost of the sale was 
$50,000. Therefore, their net profit is $40,000: $100,000 (revenue) – $10,000 (ad 
spend) – $50,000 (all other product, sales, and overhead) = $40,000.
By dividing the net profit ($40,000) by the number of clicks (1,000), they calculate that 
their value per click is $40. Therefore, if the company wants to be profitable and not 
just break even, then their bids need to be under $40.
It can be useful to put these steps into a visual reference chart (Figure 13.24) so 
you can see the chain of events.

If RSI wanted to optimize their ability to sell their product, their first step 
should not be examining their AdWords account. Before a salesperson attempts to con-
tact a business, the business has opted into two steps (whitepaper download and webi-
nar attendance) with RSI. A 10 percent phone call contact rate to a company that has 
gone through only two steps of engagement is quite low.
RSI should observe how their sales reps are contacting companies and also 
study the sales scripts. If their contact rate went to 20 percent, the company would 
have made another sale, leading to much higher profits than testing ad copy that led to 
another 5 percent of visitors. That does not mean RSI should not test ad copy—it just 
means if you have a full picture of your conversion funnel, you can spend your time 
making the biggest impact for your company. Once the phone call contact rate has 
been fixed, RSI should work on optimizing their AdWords account.

Calculating Your Max CPC
There are two main ways to perform calculations to determine your bids. One is to bid 
based on your ROAS. Setting ROAS bids is preferred by many companies because it 
lets them build in a buffer of a higher ROAS so they do not have to calculate such items 
as payroll, rent, and so forth.
The second method is to set bids by profits. When I show you this bid method, 
I will simplify the calculations, so I won’t take into account your lighting bill. You are 
going to try to maximize the profit that your account generates as if it operated in a 
vacuum apart from your typical operating costs. Once you see how the simple calcula-
tions are done, you can and should develop your own profit calculations that account 
for all appropriate product and sales costs.
Setting Bids Based on ROAS
The difficult part of bidding is not setting bids. The difficult part in determining bids is 
understanding your revenue. Once you have determined the revenue for each keyword, 
ad group, or placement, setting a bid based on ROAS is quite easy. There are a few for-
mulas you can use based on the information you have available to you.
In this section, you will use value per click, revenue per click, and profit per con-
version, which is information you can glean from your AdWords reports (as discussed 
in the earlier section “Revenue per Click”).
If you know your profit and conversion rates, you can use this method. For the 
keyword chocolate, here are the metrics:
••
Profit per conversion: $25
••
Desired ROAS: 200%
••
Conversion rate: 10%
The basic formula for setting bids based on profits is as follows:
(Profit per conversion / desired ROAS ) × (conversion rate) = max CPC
($25 / 200%) × 10% = $1.25
This can also be expressed by ($25 / 2) × 0.1 = $1.25.
If you know your value or revenue per click and do not have a margin, you can 
use this information to set a bid:
••
Value or revenue per click: $2.50
••
Desired ROAS: 200%
In this case, you can use the following formula:
Value per click / desired ROAS = max CPC
2.50 / 200% = $1.25 is the max CPC.

■  Ca lc u l at i ng You r M a x CPC
461
If you know your value or revenue per click but you have a margin, you need to 
go through two steps to calculate your max CPC. In this example, the metrics are
••
Value per click: $2
••
Margin: 50%
••
Desired ROAS: 200%
The first step is to calculate the breakeven point:
Value per click × margin = breakeven CPC
$2.00 × 50% = $1.00
The second step is to calculate the bid from the breakeven CPC:
Breakeven CPC / desired ROAS = max CPC
$1 / 200% = $0.50
Easily Make Multiple Bid Changes
Since setting bids by ROAS is a simple calculation, you can build the formula in an Excel spreadsheet 
and calculate a bid by placement, keyword, or ad group. Once you have a spreadsheet that contains 
your bids, use the bulk import feature in the AdWords Editor to quickly make all your bid changes. 
After you import your existing keywords, ad groups, or placements with your new CPCs, post those 
changes to your AdWords account. Making bulk bid changes with Excel and the AdWords Editor will 
save you a tremendous amount of time.
The preceding formulas work for setting keyword bids, placement bids, and 
ad group bids. If you want to bid by ROAS, regardless of where you want to set those 
bids, the same formulas apply. ROAS is a very simple metric to use for setting bids and 
one of the powerful bid methods available if you are going to manually bid. If you are 
looking to gain more exposure, you can see bid suggestions directly from AdWords. 
Bidding for Exposure
You can receive recommended bids from Google for your ad to be placed on the first 
page of results or at the top of the results. Just remember, this is the bid to be on the 
first or top of the page most often—it does not guarantee you will get clicks or that 
those clicks will convert. 
Bidding just to receive exposure and clicks with no other goal in mind is often 
called ego bidding, because it satisfies the CEO’s ego to be at the top of Google. 
However, if you do not make any money, you might not be at the top very long.
You can customize the columns on the Keywords tab to see the estimated first-
page and top-page bids (Figure 13.25).

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
462
Figure 13.25  First-page and top-page bids
Most industries do not have click prices this high; however, if you ever delve into 
the realm of class-action lawsuits, expect to see many bids in the $75–100 range or 
even higher. The first-page bid estimate is the approximate cost to be on page 1 for that 
keyword when the query is the same as your keyword. There are three main reasons 
why your CPC may be below the first-page bid and your ads are still making it onto the 
first-page search results.
The first is the most common: geographic reach. The first-page bid takes into 
account all the geographies where you are advertising. It is common to see hyper-
competitive areas, where bids are much higher than average. In this case, you might be 
on page 1 for the majority of your region with a bid below the first-page bid estimate—
you just aren’t on page 1 in every region.
The second most common reason is that this bid is based on when the search 
query is the same as your keyword. If you are using any match type except for exact 
match, other queries can trigger your ads to show. Your CPC could be below the first-
page bid, but for certain queries you still show on page 1. 
The third reason is related to budgets. Many advertisers do not have the budget 
to be displayed the entire day for an entire month. It is common to see budgets deplete 
near the end of the month or later in the day. When competitors’ budgets get depleted, 
your ads may show since there is less competition. 
The estimated top-page bid is the estimate required to be above the organic 
results. Often you will see many more impressions and clicks if your ads are above the 
organic results as opposed to being displayed in the right rail. To see the difference in 
side versus top impressions, you can use the AdWords Bid Simulator. 

■  Ca lc u l at i ng You r M a x CPC
463
Bid Simulator
The Bid Simulator shows you a projection of the number of impressions you would see 
if you raised or lowered your bid for a particular keyword.
To access the Bid Simulator, navigate to the keywords in your account and look 
for the graph icon next to Max. CPC (Figure 13.26).
Figure 13.26  Accessing the Bid Simulator
Not all keywords will show the graph icon. If Google does not have enough data 
to project how many impressions and clicks you will receive at different max CPCs, 
you will not see a graph. If you have a campaign that constantly hits its daily budget, 
you may not see the icon. Raising the CPC of one keyword might not get more impres-
sions since other words are also using a percentage of your daily budget. You may 
not see it inside Conversion Optimizer, Budget Optimizer, or display-only campaigns 
because you cannot bid by keyword in these instances.
Once you find a keyword where the graph exists, click the graph icon and you will 
be able to see projected clicks, cost, and impressions by different max CPCs (Figure 13.27).

Google refreshes this data daily, but changes in Quality Score, competitors’ 
bids, or search behavior can cause these numbers to become inaccurate. In addition, 
this information is only based on the last seven days of data. Therefore, it is inaccurate 
around seasonal peaks since the bids are volatile during those periods.
You should use them for guidance purposes only and not rely on the information 
as absolute. However, these numbers can help you get an idea of the available impres-
sions as you raise and lower your bids.
Bid Modifiers: Automatically Changing Bids by Time, Geography, 
Devices, and More
In the summer of 2013, Google made one of the largest changes to how AdWords bid-
ding can be accomplished with the introduction of enhanced campaigns. Enhanced 
campaigns introduced many new features, some which have been detailed in the Ad 
Extension information in Chapter 4, “Writing Compelling Ads.” The other major 
change was the expansion of bid modifiers.
With bid modifiers, you can automatically change your bids based on many fac-
tors, such as geography, time of day, day of the week, mobile devices, age, gender, and 
more. 
Bid modifiers are percentage multipliers used to adjust your bid. The ranges 
for most of the modifiers are –100 percent to 900 percent, although some, such as the 
mobile bid modifier, only range from –100 percent to 300 percent. 
If any modifier is –100%, that means your ad will not be displayed since your 
final bid will be set to $0.00. 
When you use just one modifier, the math is very simple. For example, if you 
wanted to lower your bid on a mobile device by 20 percent and your bid was $1, then 
your final bid becomes 0.8 ($1 * 0.8 = 0.8). 
However, when you use multiple modifiers together, the math is not as straight-
forward because each modifier is used in the final calculations of your bid. 
For example, if you have a bid of $1 and want to use a –50 percent modifier for 
a certain city and a +50 percent modifier when the user is on a mobile device, and the 
user happens to be in the particular city and on a mobile device, the final modifier is 
not 0 percent (+50% – 50% = 0%). The way the actual formula works, your final bid 
would be 0.75.
First adjustment: $1 (starting bid) * (–50% location bid adjustment) = $0.50
Second adjustment: $0.50 (bid from first adjustment) * (1.50 mobile bid adjust-
ment) = $0.75

■  Bid Modifiers: Au tom at ically Ch a ngi ng Bids by T i me , Geogr a ph y, Dev ices, a n d Mor e
465
This can also be expressed sequentially as
1st Adjusted Bid = Bid + (Bid*Bid Adjustment) 
= $1.00 + ($1.00*–.5)
= $1.00 + (–$.50)
1st Adj. Bid = $.50 bid
2nd Adj. Bid = (1st Adjustment) + (1st Adjustment Bid * 2nd Adjustment)
= $.50 + ($.50 *.5)
= $.50 + ($.25)
2nd Adj. Bid = $.75 final bid
While these formulas can be written out into long, complex equations, it is often 
easier to sequence them to see how the math works. As a marketer, you should under-
stand how the math works, but you do not need to know every formula. In the end, 
you need to set the proper bid adjustments based on your returns. 
One of the reasons the formula is written this way is that if any modifier used in 
an auction is –100 percent, then the final bid always becomes $0.00 regardless of any 
other modifiers. This makes it very easy to keep your ads from showing on a device or 
in a specific geography or time of day; however, it can make the math quite complex. 
For example, if you have a positive modifier of 800 percent for a location and a 
–100 percent modifier for a mobile device, the math would look like this:
1st Adjusted Bid = Bid + (Bid * Bid Adjustment) 
= $1.00 + ($1.00 * 8)
= $1.00 + $8.00
1st Adj. Bid = $9.00 bid
2nd Adj. Bid = (1st Adjustment) + (1st Adjustment Bid * 2nd Adjustment)
= $9.00 + ($9.00 * –1)
= $9.00 + -$.9.00
2nd Adj. Bid = $.00 final bid
One item to remember about bid modifier math is that your final bid is capped at 
10 × (or 900 percent higher than) your starting bid. So, if you had a bid of $1 and you 
used a +900 percent bid modifier for a particular city and a +300 percent modifier for a 
mobile device, the final bid used in the auction would not be $40 (which the bid modi-
fier math would equate to), but instead it would be capped at $10. 
While the modifiers seem quite complex, once you start to break them down 
into their respective areas, their usefulness becomes quite clear. You can download a 
spreadsheet to work through the math at http://goo.gl/IMZgs8.

and click Location, Ad Schedule, or Devices to see your campaign bid modifiers

or display. Some modifiers can be managed at the campaign level and others at ad 
group levels. Table 13.3 shows all of the modifiers and their respective information.

Lastly, since modifiers manipulate the max CPC used in the auction, they are 
incompatible with bid types that also manipulate the max CPC, such as CPA bidding. 
Bid modifiers are useful only when you are using max CPC bidding.
The exception to that rule is that the mobile bid modifier can be set to –100%, 
which means do not show the ad regardless of the bid method being used. If you 
are using CPA bidding and want your ads shown only on desktops and tablets, then 
you can add a –100% mobile device modifier and your ads will not show on mobile 
devices, yet you can continue to use CPA bidding.
To access all the bid modifiers, you must have a campaign set to All Features 
(Figure 13.30) regardless of whether it’s a search or a display campaign.
Figure 13.30  Campaign types
The most common modifiers used are location, device, and ad scheduling, so we 
will concentrate on how those particular modifiers can be used to increase the returns 
from your campaigns.
Location Bid Modifiers
Location bid modifiers allow you to adjust your bids up or down for a location. This 
is very useful if you see some areas with high performance or other areas with low 
performance.

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
468
There are two ways of seeing your performance data by geography within 
AdWords. The first is within the Location bid modifier section of your campaign set-
tings (Figure 13.31).
Figure 13.31  Location bid modifier information
This is where you can set your location bid modifiers. Before you can set a bid 
modifier for a location, you must add that location to your location targeting for that 
campaign (Figure 13.32).
Figure 13.32  Location targeting areas
In the past, before enhanced campaigns, you could not add a targeted location 
within another targeted area. For instance, if you were targeting the United States, then 
you could not also add Chicago as a target because Chicago is within the targeting of 
the United States. This was changed with the introduction of bid modifiers, so now you 
can add a region that is within another region that you are targeting. This makes it so 
that you can target the entire United States without a location bid modifier but also 
add Chicago as a targeted region and then set a bid modifier for just the Chicago area.

Within the location bid modifier settings, if you do not set an area, then you 
cannot see the stats for that area, so the best place to start examining your location 
data is within the Dimensions tab under the Geographic report (Figure 13.33).
Figure 13.33  Geographic report in Dimensions tab
In this report, the CPA for Pennsylvania is $82.37 and the CPA for Texas is only 
$47. Therefore, we would not want to use the same bid for both of these regions. If 
we wanted to, we could also drill down further into the data and see the stats for each 
metro and city within these regions, but for ease of explanation, we will stop at the 
region level.
For this account, our CPA goal is $65 and we will set bids based on that CPA 
goal. That means that Pennsylvania is above our target and Texas is below that target. 
So, we would add both Texas and Pennsylvania to our location targets for that cam-
paign and set bid modifiers for the campaign. Some simple math tells us that we need 
to reduce our bids by 21 percent in Pennsylvania.
Location Bid Modifier = 1 – (Actual CPA / Target CPA)
= 1 – ($82.37 / $65.00)
= 1 – 1.27
= -.27
We are 27 percent over the target CPA, so we would want to reduce bids by that 
amount. 
In Texas, we would want to raise our bids by 28 percent.
Location Bid Modifier = 1 – (Actual CPA / Target CPA)
= 1 – ($47.00 / $65.00)

That means we are under our CPA target by 28 percent and would want to raise 
bids by 28 percent so that we can get higher position and more clicks so that we would 
end up with more conversions in Texas at our target CPA.
Location Modifier Case Study
Location modifiers can be useful beyond just changing your bids by location for your 
existing areas, but it can also help you try to reach new customers in areas where you 
have not done well before in an easily scalable manner.
For instance, I was working with a chain of theaters that found that the vast 
majority of their customers came from only a 10-mile radius around the business 
locations. Due to the complexities of trying to layer in radius targeting before bid 
modifiers, they had given up on reaching people from faraway locations and trying to 
convince them to drive into the city for a nice dinner and play in the evening.
With the introduction of bid modifiers, they could now add multiple radius tar-
gets, each with their own bid modifiers, in an attempt to receive new conversions from 
people who lived farther away from their locations than their primary customers. In 
their home area, where they were already manually bidding on a CPA basis, they could 
keep their bids the same. Next, they could add radius targets and lower the bid auto-
matically with location bid modifiers based on how far someone was from their home 
area (Figure 13.34).
30–50 miles:
–40% of bid
20–30 miles:
–25% of bid
10–20 miles:
–15% of bid
Home –10 miles:
100% of bid
Figure 13.34  Bid modifiers by radius
The initial modifiers were just educated guesses because there was not any data 
to work from in determining the target bids for these new locations. However, after 
advertising to these new areas for a while and collecting data, they were able to set 
proper modifiers to each of these targets and increase their total bookings.

471
When your target CPAs change by location, using location modifiers can help 
you hit your target goals in multiple regions while using only a single campaign to 
reach all of your target customers. 
Since the math for setting bid adjustments is straightforward once you do it a 
few times, for the other modifiers we will focus more on how to find and use the data 
than on the math itself.
Ad Scheduling: Automatically Changing Bids by Time Periods
Ad scheduling allows you to control what days of the week and times of the day your 
ads are shown. In addition, you can automatically change bids by a percentage higher 
or lower depending on the time of day or the day of the week. This feature is also 
called day parting in many circles.
Ad scheduling as a bid modifier is not new to AdWords; it was the original bid 
modifier introduced many years ago. However, with the introduction of the other 
modifiers, this modifier has been moved from the campaign settings to where the other 
modifiers can be found within the campaign settings area (Figure 13.35).
Figure 13.35  Ad scheduling modifiers
To use ad scheduling, you first need to define your time periods. If you click the 
+Ad Schedule button, you will be presented with a screen where you can define the 
days of the week and times within each day where you can set modifiers (Figure 13.36).

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
472
Figure 13.36  Defining your ad scheduling times
Once you have defined the days of the week and times of the day and save the 
data, you can then set a bid adjustment for each of those time periods. Please note that 
you do not have to set a bid adjustment; defining a time period just gives you the option 
to set an adjustment.
The most important thing to note about ad scheduling is that the ads are shown 
based on your account’s time zone—not the user’s time zone. If you have an older 
account and have not adjusted the settings, your account is most likely in GMT–8 
or Pacific Standard Time (PST). In the bottom of the edit ad schedule screen of 
Figure 13.36 you can see the time zone for your account.
If your account and target geography are not in the same time zone, you need to 
manually adjust the times when your ad is displayed. There is a three-hour time differ-
ence between PST and EST. If your account is in PST, and you want ads to be displayed 
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. in an EST location, such as New York City, you would change 
your ad display by three hours. In this case, you would turn your ads on at 5 a.m. and 
turn them back off at 2 p.m.
The advanced use of ad scheduling is to adjust your bids by a percentage by time 
of day or day of the week. If you were a catering company, you might find that

■  Bid Modifiers: Au tom at ically Ch a ngi ng Bids by T i me , Geogr a ph y, Dev ices, a n d Mor e
473
••
Between midnight and 6:15 a.m., you receive few phone calls, yet some people 
are looking for your service; therefore, set your bids to 60 percent of normal, 
which means using a –40 percent bid modifier.
••
Between 6:15 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., those who hire you for the day are starting to 
filter into the office, and therefore you want to run your bids at a normal rate.
••
Between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m., your calls skyrocket for businesspeople who 
want their lunch catered. In this case, you set your bid adjustment to 20 percent 
higher than normal.
••
Between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., you are delivering orders and do not have 
time to answer the phone. Therefore, you turn off your account during these 
hours, and you do not include them in your ad schedule.
••
Between 1:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., some companies order catering for the next 
day, and therefore you set your bids to 100 percent of normal. These are the 
standard bids you set for your account, so you will not set an adjustment during 
this time period.
••
Between 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., you receive some orders, but the call volume is 
lower; therefore you set your bids to 80 percent of normal by using a –20 percent 
bid adjustment.
••
Between 8:00 p.m. and midnight, call volume drops significantly, and therefore 
you only want to pay 60 percent of your normal click price, so you set a –40 
percent bid adjustment.
••
You do not work on Saturday or Sunday, so you do not include these two days in 
the ad scheduling. 
If this is your scenario, the ad scheduling would look like Figure 13.35; with the 
exception that the data on the screen would be much larger and show all of the time 
periods.
If you have times of the day when you do not answer the phone, then you can 
simply enable ad scheduling and include only the times when your office is open. If you 
are trying to control costs, run your ads only when your conversion rates are highest. 
To maximize returns, examine when you receive conversions and change your bids 
based on that conversion activity.
Finding Conversion Information by Time Frames
There are two methods you can use to extract conversion information by day or hour 
from Google products; one is in Google Analytics and the other is in AdWords. 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■

Finding Day-of-the-Week Conversion Information in AdWords Reports
Google AdWords allows you to see conversion information and most of your metrics 
by hour, day, day of the week (Figure 13.37), and more. In the Dimensions tab, exam-
ine the unit of time in the drop-down list.
Figure 13.37  Time-based reports
A good report to start with is just examining your conversion rates and CPAs by 
day of the week (Figure 13.38).
Figure 13.38  Day Of The Week report
This account’s conversion rate and cost per conversion are better on the week-
days than the weekends. Therefore, they should set a negative bid adjustment for 
Saturday and Sunday.
Whenever you start changing bids by the time of day or the day of the week, or you 
turn off your account completely, you need to track total conversion changes. You may 
find that someone is looking for you on a Sunday but calling you on Monday morning.

■  Bid Modifiers: Au tom at ically Ch a ngi ng Bids by T i me , Geogr a ph y, Dev ices, a n d Mor e
475
You can also see hourly information in the AdWords reports (Figure 13.39), 
which can be useful to see how conversions change based on the course of days. It is 
common to see conversion rates higher for travel companies during lunch hour, dating 
sites after 10 p.m., and retail throughout the daylight hours.
Figure 13.39  Viewing conversion rates by hour
When you start digging into all the nuances of how hours of the day and days of 
the week affect your conversion rates, what you really want to see is conversion rates and 
CPA by hour of day. This data is available but not within the interface. To see day by day 
and by hour, you will need to create a report and segment the information. For instance, 
if you are examining hour-of-day information, then you can create a report, and before 
you download it click the Segment link and segment by day of the week (Figure 13.40).
Figure 13.40  Segmenting data by day of the week

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
476
If you were downloading the data from the Day Of The Week report, then you 
would segment by hour of the day. Both reports will get you to the same data.
In addition, you can also download this data from Google Analytics by creating 
a custom report (Figure 13.41).
Figure 13.41  Google Analytics custom report
Once you have chosen the information you want to see, export it to Excel and 
create charts so you can view the information and see if there are clear trends. Some 
businesses will not see conversion rates change by time of day or by hour; others will 
see drastic changes.
Often the differences can be explained by typical user behavior. Marketing is 
about reaching people. People’s behaviors change based on the factors in their lives. 
Therefore, you need to ask the question: How do your customers go about their 
daily lives?
Examples of Ad Scheduling Success
Microsoft’s Atlas Solutions published an interesting paper on conversion rates by 
industry titled “Search Conversion Rates by Day Part,” by Esco Strong. In this paper, 
Atlas Solutions published several charts that showed conversion rates by time of day. 
Upon examining each of these charts, you can see conversion rates change based on

what is going on in someone’s life. The first chart (Figure 13.42) shows conversion rates

Conversion rates are low in the morning; many people are sleeping, and those 
who are surfing the Web are often not buying. Once consumers awaken, they may be 
more concerned with getting to work and earning money than they are about their 
personal finances. However, lunch hour is their own time. The conversion rates spike 
over the lunch hour. After lunch, consumers go back to work and then commute home. 
This is no longer their personal time, and conversion rates go down. Just before and 
after dinner time, the conversion rates again increase. As the evening wanes on, con-
version rates steadily decline as consumers go to sleep. The chart looks interesting. 
When paired with a consumer’s daily routine, it tells you the best time to reach these 
consumers.
Examining your consumer’s routine, and finding the times when the consumer is 
searching for you so you can adjust your targeting, applies to both consumer and busi-
ness searchers.
Business-to-Business Case Study
When deciding to change bids by the day of the week or the time of day, it is essential 
that you have enough information to make solid decisions. This is a case study for a 
business-to-business company. Their goal was to offer an IT whitepaper download to 
bring consumers into their conversion funnel. The first step was to graph conversion 
rates by hour (Figure 13.43).

At first glance it appears that conversion rates are higher during work hours.

Figure 13.44  Conversion rates by day of the week for a whitepaper download
Now we have some interesting information. While the conversion rates seemed 
higher during working hours, it turns out that Sunday is their second-highest convert-
ing day. If you stopped here and decided to make bid decisions, you would be making 
a mistake. Because Tuesday and Sunday are their highest converting days, let’s see the 
conversion rates by hour for those two days (Figure 13.45).

Although on Tuesday conversion rates are higher during work hours, the oppo-
site is true of Sunday. Sunday night is a common business-to-business search evening 
for people who left work early on Friday evening or did not finish all the work assigned 
to them the previous week. Only after this last chart is completed does this company 
have enough information to set bids by time of day and day of the week. Please note 
that these are the results for one company. You may not find the same results and 
should conduct your own research into your conversion rates by hour.
This company’s goal was a whitepaper download, but there are many cre-
ative ways to utilize ad scheduling if you just think through what you are trying to 
accomplish.
Creating Time-Sensitive Offers
Marketing is about connecting with consumers. With AdWords, the first connection is 
based on keywords. The second connection is often location targeting. You could make 
the next connection to the Display Network by writing ads specific to a site or type of 
website where your ads appear. And finally, you can use day of the week or time of day 
in the ad copy.
Most restaurants have daily specials. You could create a campaign for every day 
of the week. In your ad copy, add the daily special (Figure 13.46). Your keywords will 
be the same for each campaign. The keywords will not compete with each other—one 
campaign will only run on Monday, another only on Tuesday, and so on.

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
480
Figure 13.46  Time-sensitive offer for restaurant
Are there times when your business is slow? On Friday afternoons, most people 
in the office are more concerned with their evening plans than fixing a leaky pipe. 
However, you can write an ad that speaks to both the day of the week and the time of 
the day to help engage those who are searching (Figure 13.47).
Figure 13.47  Time-sensitive offer using day  
of the week and time of day in the ad copy
In this example, there would be two campaigns. One campaign would run from 
noon until 5:00 p.m. on a Friday. The other campaign would run from 5:00 p.m. on a 
Friday until noon the following Friday.
Once you understand all the possibilities of how ads are displayed, you can be 
highly creative in engaging your audience in unique methods beyond just changing bids 
and conversion actions.
Device Modifiers
Another bid modifier is the device modifier. This modifier allows you to change the bids 
for mobile devices automatically. While the first two modifiers covered only work at the 
campaign level, the device modifier can be applied at a campaign or an ad group level.
This often leads to another level of segmentation for your ad groups. If you have 
some keywords in an ad group that do very well on mobile devices and others that do 
poorly on mobile devices, then you will have to split up these ad groups into multiple 
ad groups so that some can use positive bid modifiers and others can use negative bid 
modifiers for devices.
Since this type of ad group segmentation gets into account organization, we will 
cover this in depth in Chapter 14, “Organizing Accounts Successfully.”
At a high level, you can segment your data by device (Figure 13.48) to view your 
cost-per-conversion differences by device to set your mobile bid modifier at the cam-
paign level.
In this account, the overall CPA for mobile and desktops is almost identical; 
however, for the one campaign displayed, mobile devices have a slightly higher CPA 
than desktops. So this account has some campaigns (such as the one displayed) that 
will want to use negative mobile bid modifiers and others that will want to use positive 
mobile bid modifiers. 

■  U n dersta n di ng At t r i bu t ion M a nagem en t
481
Figure 13.48  Campaign data segmented by device
You can set device modifiers only for mobile devices. You cannot set them for 
tablet or desktop devices. Tablet and desktop devices will use the default bid for that ad 
group or keyword (unless other modifiers such as geography or ad scheduling are also 
employed).
So far, we have examined ways of bidding based on ROAS and CPA metrics and 
then manipulating those bids with bid modifiers. However, the question that needs 
to be asked is “Should you always bid based on ROAS or CPA?” A look into attribu-
tion management may tell you there are times when you do not want to set bids based 
purely on ROAS.
Understanding Attribution Management
Each of the bidding techniques we examined set bids based on the conversion rate of 
a keyword or ad group. The AdWords conversion tracker applies a conversion value 
only to the last keyword, ad group, ad, and landing page clicked from your AdWords 
account.
For example, if someone clicked on your ad yesterday for the keyword MP3 
player, looked at your website, but did not convert, and then that same user saw your 
ad today for the keyword 16GB iPod touch, clicked it, and then converted on your 
website, what metrics would show in your AdWords account?
Both keywords would show that they received a click and incurred costs. 
However, only the last keyword clicked, 16GB iPod touch, would show a conversion 
in your AdWords account. Each time a user clicks on your ad, Google overwrites the 
conversion-tracking code cookie. Therefore, the conversion tracker is known as a last-
click attribution management system.
To make matters more complicated, Google Analytics associates goals with the 
last entrance to the website. Therefore, if someone clicks on your ad today and then 
comes back to your site directly tomorrow and converts, Google Analytics will show 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
482
that a direct traffic entrance received the conversion, and yet Google AdWords will 
show that the last keyword clicked in your account received the conversion.
It is common for searchers to start out with general phrases to learn more about 
a product. As they learn more, their search becomes more specific in their keyword 
selection. The search behavior mirrors the buying funnel. Let’s assume that you sell 
MP3 players and that a searcher did the searches shown in Figure 13.49; each time they 
clicked on your ad before finally purchasing from your company.
MP3 Player
Apple iPod
Microsoft Zune
16GB iPod 
touch
Buy
Figure 13.49  Search process before making a purchase
If you only bid by ROAS or by profits, technically only the last keyword, 16GB 
iPod touch, would have a bid higher than zero. Because the other keywords did not 
have a conversion associated with them, they did not bring ROI to your account and 
therefore are wasting you money. However, are they really wasting you money? Or is 
it that the searcher first became engaged with your company after searching for MP3 
Player and the only reason they kept clicking on your ads before finally purchasing was 
that you helped them learn more about MP3 players after their very first click?
In this scenario, if you deleted all of the words except for 16GB iPod touch you 
might find that your total conversions drop significantly. Although your ROAS would 
probably go up—ROAS is only a percentage—your total revenue and profits would 
most likely drop. In these cases, what do you do? You have two options.
The first is to use an attribution management system. There are third-party ven-
dors that will track each of these clicks and tell you which keywords did not convert 
but originally brought a searcher to your site who converted at a later time. You could 
also build such a system in-house, but if you do, be prepared to invest some time and 
money. Even using a sophisticated third-party system is not cheap. If you do not have 
the money to invest right now, there is a second solution you can employ: You can use 
Google’s Assisted Conversions report.
When you navigate to Assisted Conversions under Multi Channel Funnels, you 
can see additional information about your conversions (Figure 13.50). The easiest way 
to navigate to this report is to go Tools > Conversions > Search Funnels, and then look 
for Multi Channel Funnels at the bottom of your screen.

■  U n dersta n di ng At t r i bu t ion M a nagem en t
483
Figure 13.50  Assisted Click report
From here you can examine how your various campaigns and keywords assisted 
in conversions and the value of those assists. 
If you see keywords that are assisting in conversions but do not have many con-
versions themselves, you may not want to just remove them from your account. You 
can instead either set bids on them based on the additional value they are bringing to 
your company, or you can use them in a Maximize Clicks campaign, as discussed ear-
lier in the section “Exploring AdWords Bidding Options.”
If you would like to use metrics to determine what keywords should be placed 
into a Maximize Clicks campaign, examine bounce rates, average page views, and goal 
conversions in Google Analytics for each keyword. If you see keywords that are lead-
ing to high interaction on your website but those keywords are not converting and are 
early buying funnel keywords, then add the words to the Maximize Clicks campaign. 
If those keywords start to convert and you wish to bid on them based on their value, 
move them into a max CPC or Conversion Optimizer campaign.
Google Analytics also has attribution models (Figure 13.51) built into the system 
so that you can start to see how the usage of different attribution models will affect 
your advertising. 
“Attribution management” is a buzz phrase that will receive more exposure in 
the future. If you buy banner ads and they seem to not lead to conversions, your wal-
let will tell you that you should stop buying those ads. However, if you have data that 
shows you that when someone sees your banner ad your conversion rate for search 
increases for those individuals, you might have a different opinion on those banner ads. 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
484
Multiple marketing channels do affect each other. Cross-channel attribution manage-
ment will only continue to increase in sophistication over the coming years.
Figure 13.51  Attribution models
Examining AdWords Reports to Make ROAS Bid Decisions
When you download AdWords information, you are often buried in data. The first 
step to analyzing the information is to use conditional formatting to put the data into 
a visual reference, as discussed earlier in the section “Revenue per Click.” It can also 
be useful to put your ad groups into various buckets so that you can analyze similar 
ad groups together. Let’s examine an ad group report (Figure 13.52) and sort the ad 
groups into a meaningful organization.
Figure 13.52  Ad group report

■  Ex a m i n i ng A dWor ds R eports to M a k e ROAS Bi d Decisions
485
You can do this analysis at the keyword, ad, landing page, or placement level. 
We will walk through it at an ad group level, but there are times you will want to go 
through this same exercise with different data points.
It is useful to add two columns to the AdWords reports. The first, Column F, 
is ROAS. It is a percentage of how high the returns are for any ad group regardless of 
total dollars spent. The second data column is Profit. Subtract cost from revenue to 
arrive at profit. This profit metric is profit for the account only; it does not take into 
account hard costs or other overhead. In this case, we are assuming there are no mar-
gins involved. If there are, first calculate margins and then profit. Once we have those 
data points calculated, let’s group these ad groups.
Low-Cost, Low-Return Ad Groups  Ad groups 1 to 4 have zero conversions associated with 
them. They also have not spent much money. If you set a bid based on profits or ROAS, 
these ad groups would have to be turned off, because the bids would be $0.00. First, 
analyze if these ad groups have good keywords in them. Are they keywords that you 
tested and they failed? If so, delete them. Are they keywords that appear early in the 
buying cycle, and you like them, but they do not receive returns? If so, move them to a 
Maximize Clicks campaign.
Medium-Cost, Solid-Return Ad Groups  Ad groups 6 to 11 have all spent some money and have 
decent revenue. A few of them have negative revenue numbers. For these ad groups, set 
bids based on profits or ROAS. You should do some testing and tweaking of these ad 
groups over time, but they are not going to be top-priority ad groups.
High-Spend, High-Return Ad Groups  Ad groups 12 and 13 have high spends and excellent 
returns. While you might be tempted to significantly increase the bids on these ad 
groups based on profits, especially ad group 12, be careful about making dramatic 
changes in your profit centers. These two ad groups bring in more revenue than all of 
the other ad groups combined. It is not uncommon to find a handful of keywords or ad 
groups that are a large percentage of your overall revenue.
The AdWords system can be temperamental at times. In ad groups like these, change 
the bids by 10 percent or 20 percent and make sure your returns are the same at the 
higher bid prices. If the returns stay profitable, then raise the bids again by 10 or 20 
percent. Do not make dramatic changes in these ad groups. In addition, on the home 
screen of your AdWords account you can set a watch list of items you want to keep a 
close eye on. Add these ad groups to the watch list. These are ad groups you should 
check on daily, because a slight change can cause a dramatic change in your profits.
High-Spend, High-Traffic, Medium- or Low-Return Ad Groups  Sometimes the hardest part of 
AdWords is finding keywords with high search volume or keywords where you can 
drive a lot of traffic to your website. Ad group 14 has spent $19,046 and has made only 
$21,580. This ad group has a lot of traffic, but it barely makes money. However, it 
has potential to be a high-revenue ad group. This is an ad group that you want to keep 

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
486
a close eye on because a slight change could cause you to start losing a lot of money 
instead of barely making money. Add this ad group to your watch list as well.
The best optimization you can take with an ad group like this is to start testing. In 
Chapter 15, “Implementing Testing Techniques That Will Increase Profits,” you will 
learn how to test ad copy and landing pages to increase conversion rates. This ad group 
is a perfect candidate for testing.
High ROI Ad Groups  The ROI of the first 14 ad groups does not break 330 percent. 
However, ad groups 15 and 16 both have over a 560 percent ROI. That is a significant 
difference from all the other ad groups. While these ad groups are not at the top in 
spend or profits, there is some combination that is leading to a fantastic customer expe-
rience. When you see ad groups like these, learn from them. Examine the keywords, ad 
copy, and landing pages to see if there are aspects of this search combination that you 
can utilize in other ad groups. With these ad groups, you can set bids based on profits 
or ROAS; however, when you have outliers, examine and learn from the data.
Once you determine your ad group types, you can label them in AdWords for 
easy reference. The number of labels you use will vary by account size; however, here 
are some easy ones (Figure 13.53):
••
HCHC: high conversions and high clicks
••
HCLC: high conversions and low clicks
••
MCMC: medium conversions and medium clicks
••
LCHC: low conversions and high clicks
Repeat for your own segmentation.
Figure 13.53  Ad group labels
Once you have labeled your ad groups, you can easily create filters in the inter-
face to see only a certain type of ad group (Figure 13.54). 
Working on long-tail ad groups, where you will bid at the ad group level is much 
different than working with ad groups, where the keywords have so much data you 
want to do keyword-level bidding. By filtering by various types of ad groups, you can 
easily group your ad group work so that you do not have to switch mind-sets as you 
progress through your day.

Figure 13.54  Ad group filters
Setting bids, controlling your marketing costs, and examining your profits are 
essential to making money with AdWords. However, it is equally important to under-
stand how your customers buy from you so that you do not suddenly stop buying key-
words that were indirectly leading to conversion or start making dramatic changes in 
your profit centers.
It is easy to end up in a paralysis-by-analysis scenario with AdWords because 
you have so much data available to you. Put your ad groups into meaningful groups 
so you can work on similar items together and continue to refine and improve your

Best Practices for Utilizing Profitable Bid Strategies
Every ad group must have a bid associated with it. You can set bids at the keyword, 
ad group, ad group display, placement, and other levels. However, a bid must exist for 
your ad to be shown. What is important is not just bidding to the top position but bid-
ding based on the profit your AdWords account is making your company. By following 
these best practices, you should be able to set bids based on conversion metrics:
••
Do not spend a penny on marketing until you understand your company’s goals.
••
After you have written down your marketing goals, find a way to measure those 
goals. Use the AdWords conversion tracker to track goals that occur online. Use 
phone call tracking to track offline conversions.
••
If you want to maximize conversions, test the Conversion Optimizer bid system.

Chapter 13:  Dev isi ng Prof i ta ble Bi d St r at egi e s  ■
488
••
If you want to maximize traffic, put keywords into a Maximize Clicks cam-
paign. If you have keywords you like that do not lead to conversions, put them 
in a Maximize Clicks campaign.
••
Calculate the ROAS for each keyword, ad group, and placement in your 
account.
••
Once you have determined the profit by taking margins and other factors into 
account when necessary, set bids based on profit or ROAS.
••
When examining large spreadsheets, use conditional formatting to give yourself 
a visual reference of the data.
••
Learn when your customers are most receptive to your marketing messages 
based on how they live their lives, and then use ad scheduling to set bids based 
on your returns at those various times.
••
Use location modifiers to adjust your bids based on how each region performs.
••
Use device modifiers to automatically change your bids for mobile devices.
••
Put ad groups into like-minded buckets so that you can work on similar types of 
ad groups at once.
••
Do not always set ROAS bids if they make dramatic changes in your most 
profitable ad groups. Be careful with your profit centers and make incremental 
changes.
••
The more traffic an ad group receives, the higher the chance it has to bring profit 
to your company. If these ad groups are barely profitable, test both their ad copy 
and landing pages.
••
Be creative; the more you learn about AdWords possibilities, the more creative 
you can become in reaching users in unique ways.
Setting the proper bids will move your account from just spending money to 
making money. Knowing where your dollars are being spent, watching the returns, and 
making adjustments as necessary are paramount to finding profit with AdWords.
However, a bid just tells Google how much you are willing to pay for a click. 
Your ads and keywords allow you to reach the consumer with the proper message. The 
ads and keywords are governed by the campaign’s reach, be it by time of day, day of 
the week, geographic location, or display versus search reach. The organization of your 
account will have as much to do with your success as the bid will.
In the next chapter, you will learn various ways of organizing your account 
based on the goals of your account and how you want to reach customers.

Organizing Accounts 
Successfully
Successful account organization consists of three 
levels of decisions. The first decision is determin-
ing how many accounts you need. The second 
requires you to look within an account at the 
number of campaigns you need based on your 
targeting and budgets and determine how to 
properly organize the campaign settings. Finally, 
you need to decide how to organize your cam-
paign’s ad groups so you have tightly themed ad 
copy and keywords.
Account organization is not difficult if 
you understand your marketing goals and the 
AdWords settings we have discussed throughout 
the book so far. Proper account organization is 
essential if you want to gain the most benefit 
from your AdWords marketing dollars.

What Is an AdWords Account?
An AdWords account represents a business. Each business should have only one 
AdWords account. Only one ad from an account will ever show in any given search 
result.
Since each AdWords account represents a business, items such as billing infor-
mation, contact information, and access rights are stored at the account level. This is 
the basic information you need to open an AdWords account.
If you manage accounts on behalf of clients, such as a PPC (pay-per-click) 
agency, each client should have its own account. If you are an internal marketer, even if 
you have multiple websites, you should have a single Google account.
There are times when a business might be very large, or the business has sub-
sidiaries with multiple websites that you feel are so separated that the business should 
be allowed to show two ads on a given search result page or have multiple AdWords 
accounts. In these cases, talk to a Google representative before enabling multiple 
accounts for the same business to make sure you are not violating the AdWords terms 
of service.
Note:  If you need multiple accounts because you are an agency managing accounts on behalf of third parties, 
then you do not need to talk to a Google representative.
In the early days of AdWords, a search for many keywords might have led to a 
page of ads for the same company. Often, these additional ads were affiliate ads that 
all led to the same website. When multiple ads lead to the same page, searchers often 
become frustrated over lack of options. In January 2005, Google made a policy change: 
Only one ad per website would be shown on a search results page. This expanded con-
sumer choice on a search result has meant a much better search experience.
The “one account per company” policies are also based on consumer choice. 
If you are creating multiple accounts to get around policies designed to enhance the 
search experience, you could run into terms of service issues. This is why it is a good 
practice to talk to Google about why you need multiple accounts and let them help you.
What Are the Limits of an AdWords Account?
A basic Google account has these maximum limits:
••
10,000 campaigns (includes active and paused campaigns)
••
20,000 ad groups per campaign
••
20,000 ad group targets per ad group (i.e., keywords, placements, audience lists, 
and product targets)
••
5 million ad group targets per account (i.e., keywords, placements, audience 
lists, and product targets)

■  W h at Is a n A dWor ds Accou n t?
491
••
300 display ads per ad group (includes image ads)
••
50 text ads per ad group
••
4 million active or paused ads per account 
••
20 shared negative keyword lists per account
••
5,000 negative keywords per negative keyword list
••
100,000 active upgraded ad extensions per account
In the past, AdWords was much more restrictive in how many active campaigns 
and keywords could be in an account. The account size limits are now so large that 
only the largest of companies should run into account size limit issues. If you see the 
message “Your account is nearing an unmanageable size,” that usually indicates you 
are reaching the keyword limits for an account. If you need more active campaigns 
or active keywords, your Google representative can link accounts together on the 
back-end. It is possible to have over 10 million keywords active in Google at one time; 
however, doing so would require at least three accounts being linked together. Just 
remember that you should always contact Google before creating a second account to 
make sure you will stay within their terms of service.
Unfortunately, there are no fixed guidelines defining a large spend or when an 
account qualifies for a representative. Google assigns reps on a “need-analysis” basis. 
If you spend more than $100,000 per year on AdWords, it can be worth your time to 
contact Google and ask them if you have a representative or any additional support 
options.
Not everyone will be allowed to link accounts together. Each keyword, cam-
paign, ad group, and ad copy takes up space in Google’s database. Each time someone 
searches for a keyword, Google must examine their entire database and perform an 
auction to see which keywords and ad copy should be shown to the searcher. If you are 
spending a low amount per month, it is not cost effective for Google to store all that 
data and use the processing power required to continually look through all your key-
words to see what should be shown. It can be useful to talk to your Google representa-
tive about your keyword and campaign needs to see if you can link multiple accounts 
together.
Managing Multiple Accounts the Easy Way
If you need multiple accounts—either because your account is so large that you need 
two or more linked accounts or because you are an agency and manage accounts on 
behalf of multiple companies—the My Client Center (MCC) will be extremely useful 
to you.
A My Client Center account (Figure 14.1) allows you to link multiple accounts 
together in a single interface. From within the interface, you can easily navigate 

Chapter 14:  Orga n i zi ng Accou n ts Succe ssf u lly  ■
492
between the accounts, see account statistics in a single place, or run reports across all 
the accounts in the MCC.
Figure 14.1  My Client Center overview screen
To navigate between the accounts, you can use the drop-down box at the top of 
the screen, click on a client name from the MCC screen, or use the search box. If you 
have thousands of clients, I recommend that you name them appropriately so that you 
can easily use the search feature to find the account you want to view.
By default, one account in an MCC does not affect another. Therefore, items 
like Quality Score are not shared, and each account can show an ad on a search result 
(assuming they have different display and destination URLs).
If you are running a large account where Google linked the accounts together on 
the back-end, you can also add all of these accounts to the MCC so that you can enjoy 
the benefits of the MCC. In this case, the accounts can affect each other.
If you have a tremendous number of accounts, you can also nestle MCCs. For 
instance, if you manage clients, manage your own PPC spend, and have one large client 
that has five linked accounts, you would want to organize your MCCs accordingly:
••
Top-level MCC to see everything
••
Sub-MCC for your large client with five accounts
••
Sub-MCC for your own spend
••
Sub-MCC for the rest of your clients
Note:  Although you can have multiple levels of sub-MCCs, unless you are managing more than 10,000 
accounts, you will rarely need more than four or five levels of MCCs.

■  W h at Is a n A dWor ds Accou n t?
493
The three reasons to have multiple levels of MCCs are for organizational 
purposes, for permission purposes (so one analyst or client can view only their own 
accounts), or if you are on consolidated invoicing with Google. Manager Defined 
Spend (MDS) allows you to receive a single invoice for all clients either in all MCCs 
or for a specific MCC. Therefore, if you have one client paying their bill directly to 
Google and other clients who are paying you for their spend, you may also want 
to organize the clients based on billing options to make it easier for the accounting 
department.
My Client Center Benefits
The My Client Center comes with many benefits that will save you time and make it 
easier to manage multiple accounts:
Access Levels  As with AdWords accounts, there are also different access levels you can 
give an individual. The first is administrative access. Someone with this access level 
can add and delete any user—and that can include you. Be careful when assigning this 
access level. The second level is standard access. This user cannot add or remove users 
but can make changes to any account. The third level is read-only access. These users 
can see the data but cannot make changes in an account. When you give someone 
access through the MCC, they can see that MCC and any sub-MCCs, plus any account 
contained within those MCCs. If you give someone access to a sub-MCC, they cannot 
see the MCCs or accounts above their level of access.
Linking Accounts  If a user already has an existing AdWords account, you will need to 
send them an invitation to link their account to yours. Once you send them an invite, 
they will see a message in their AdWords account that they have to click on to give you 
permission to link to their account. Once the account is linked, you can enjoy the ben-
efits of having an account linked to from the MCC.
Creating Accounts  Linking accounts can be time consuming if you have hundreds or thou-
sands of accounts. Instead of creating accounts outside of the MCC and then having 
to link them at a later date, you can create new accounts in the MCC so that they are 
already linked.
Budget Controls  The Budget tab of the MCC allows you to see the spend of each account. 
In addition, if the accounts are on invoicing or other payment methods instead of credit 
card billing, you can change the monthly spends, see the percentage of their budget 
spent, and other options from this tab (Figure 14.2).
Alerts  If there are issues with your account, Google will show alerts at the account 
level. In the MCC, you can view the alerts for all the accounts in the MCC on a single 
screen, making it easier to troubleshoot issues.

Chapter 14:  Orga n i zi ng Accou n ts Succe ssf u lly  ■
494
Figure 14.2  Viewing and managing budgets from the MCC
Cross-Account Reporting  Finally, you can run reports across all accounts in an MCC at a 
single time. If you are a large advertiser and therefore need five different accounts, this 
will be a huge timesaver. Instead of having to log into each account to run a report, 
you can run reports that include data from all your accounts at once. You can select 
various reports to run and which accounts to include with these cross-account reports.
To create a My Client Center account, go to www.google.com/adwords/­
myclientcenter and use the wizard to create a new MCC. Once you have access to 
the MCC, you can also join the Google Advertising Professionals Program.
Becoming a Google Partner
Google has a professional certification program that offers certification for companies. 
For a company to be certified by Google, they need to meet the following requirements:
••
Have at least one person who has passed two Google AdWords certification exams
••
Have spent at least $10,000 within their MCC in the past 90 days
••
Have spent money on at least 60 of those 90 days
••
Demonstrate that the company can follow best practices
••
Set up and complete a company profile
Once you have met the requirements, your company can be considered a Google 
Certified Partner and gain the use of a logo that you can use in various means with 
your marketing materials (Figure 14.3).

Figure 14.3  AdWords Certified Partner logo
Note:  To sign up for the Google Partner Program, go to https://www.google.com/partners/ and 
sign in with your Google account. You will walk through a wizard to create your professional account. Once you have 
an account, you will be able to invite new professionals, take the AdWords certification tests, and gain access to 
helpful materials (Figure 14.4).
Figure 14.4  Google Partner materials
You do not have to sign up for the Google Partner program to gain access to 
an MCC account. It is an additional certification you can gain to help you sell your 
AdWords services to other companies or use as a nice bullet point on your résumé.

Developing a Successful Campaign Structure
A campaign is a collection of ad groups. Each ad group consists of keywords and ad 
copy. Google follows your campaign settings to determine where, when, and how you 
would like those ads displayed. If you would like keywords or ads displayed differ-
ently based on varying conditions, you need a different campaign for each of those 
conditions.
Every time you create a new campaign, you must set a budget for that campaign. 
If you spread your budget out across too many campaigns, your budget can become 
very thin and you could be limiting your ad display. In addition, every time you make 
a new campaign, you have more campaigns to manage. Therefore, the first question is, 
“Why should you create a second campaign?” This section first examines the reasons 
to separate campaigns, and then I will use sample company objectives to show you how 
a company should structure their campaigns based on their objectives.
Reasons to Create New Campaigns
The decision to create a new campaign is a big one. Most companies have finite bud-
gets, and every campaign must have a budget. So if you try to spread that budget out 
across hundreds of campaigns, you could have an organizational nightmare on your 
hands. There are many reasons to have multiple campaigns; here is a list of the most 
common reasons to create new campaigns:
Daily Budget  Every campaign must have a daily budget. As you add more campaigns, 
you have to decide how much you want to spend on each. One way of organizing cam-
paigns is by business objectives or conversion types and then by deciding how much 
you want to spend to reach those objectives. If you have multiple products, and each 
product has its own marketing budget, separating the campaigns by products will help 
you reach those goals. There is a shared budget feature that can help mitigate the issues 
of having to split up your budget across multiple campaigns.
Targeting Methods  This is the most common reason to separate campaigns. You should 
have separate campaigns for display and search. However, if you are also targeting 
through remarketing, interests, topics, and even more methods, it is common to see 
each targeting method have its own campaign for ease of understanding how the ads in 
a campaign are being displayed.
Location Targeting  Geographic targeting is set at the campaign level, and the second most 
common reason to have multiple campaigns is wanting to use different keywords, 
ads, or landing pages in different geographies, as covered in Chapter 11, “Utilizing 
Advanced Geographic Targeting Techniques.”
Bidding Type  In Chapter 13, “Devising Profitable Bid Strategies,” you saw the various 
bidding types: Budget Optimizer, Conversion Optimizer, and maximum CPC or CPM 
bidding. While you can use flexible bidding to set different bid methods per ad group, 

■  Dev elopi ng a Succe ssf u l Ca m pa ign St ruc t u r e
497
many companies like to separate out the different bid types at the campaign level for 
ease of organization.
Ad Scheduling  Ad scheduling is set at the campaign level, and by default, campaigns are 
set to show ads 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. As long as your budget is not limiting 
your ad delivery, your ad is eligible to be shown all the time. If you want one ad to be 
shown on a Monday and a different ad to be shown on Tuesday, you will need a differ-
ent campaign for each time frame in which you want different ads, keywords, or land-
ing pages to be eligible for the auction, as discussed in Chapter 13.
Whenever you want your keywords, ads, and landing pages to be governed by a 
different campaign setting, you need a new campaign. The items earlier in this list are 
the most common reasons to create new campaigns, but even items such as ad delivery 
method or ad serving methodology can be reasons to create new campaigns if you want 
different keywords or ads to follow different campaign rules.
Structuring Campaigns to Achieve Business Goals
There are thousands of ways to structure your campaign settings based on your busi-
ness goals. If you do not know your business goals, you cannot set bids appropriately 
or understand the best way to structure your campaigns. This is why it is so important 
to know what you would like your marketing to accomplish.
This section examines some common business goals and then shows you how 
the campaigns in an account should be organized.
Basic Campaign Structure to Maximize Search Returns
For most small companies, you can often just use a single search campaign to manage 
all of your ad groups. However, as your account grows, often you will find that you 
have two types of keywords:
••
Managed keywords: Exact match keywords that have proven revenue
••
Discovery keywords: Modified broad match keywords that try to find new prof-
itable keywords that can be added as exact match keywords
With this basic type of structure, you will end up with two campaigns. The first 
campaign will be the managed keyword campaign. These keywords have proven reve-
nue and will be mostly exact match keywords and will spend as much as possible since 
all the keywords are proven to generate revenue.
The second campaign, known as a discovery campaign, has a goal of finding 
new exact match keywords to add to the managed campaign. Some days this campaign 
will make money and other days it will not. Its goal is not to make money; its goal is to 
find new revenue-generating keywords. Since these words are usually modified broad 
match, it is very possible for a search query to trigger a keyword from either campaign. 

Chapter 14:  Orga n i zi ng Accou n ts Succe ssf u lly  ■
498
Therefore, this campaign will have all the keywords listed in the managed campaign as 
exact match negatives so that you are fully controlling the ad serving.
With this type of structure, as an account grows, you will often end up with 
multiple managed campaigns based on the reasons why you want to create campaigns, 
such as different budgets by product lines. For larger accounts, those that need many 
campaigns, this type of structure does not always work because the management of 
finding queries, adding new keywords, and managing negative keyword lists often 
becomes overly burdensome. In those cases, you will most likely create a campaign by 
product line and then use bid management and query mining to manage the bids, new 
keywords, and negative keywords.
Basic Campaign Structure to Maximize Display Returns
When you want to maximize returns for all your display targeting methods, there is a 
straightforward place to start that will use three campaigns:
Display Discovery Campaigns  For each targeting method, such as keywords, interests, and 
topics, create a campaign. The goal of these campaigns is to find good placements. 
Some days these campaigns will do quite well, and on other days they will not fare so 
well. Their overall goal is to find great placements.
Since you will still want to manage bids for these targeting types, it is best for each ad 
group to have only a single target, such as one topic, one interest, or a close-knit set of 
keywords.
When you find a placement that has proven revenue value, then you will want to make 
it a negative placement in the campaign and add it to a managed placement campaign.
Managed Placement Campaign  The managed placement campaign is made up only of place-
ments that are helping you reach your advertising goals. Because this campaign consists 
only of sites where you want your ads to be shown as much as possible, this campaign 
will usually have your highest display budget.
Remarketing Campaign  While remarketing ads show across the Display Network, these 
ads are triggered based on interaction with your website. Since this is a much different 
target than the other display targeting methods, you should separate out your remar-
keting efforts into their own campaign. In most cases, if you have multiple remarketing 
lists, each list will have its own ad group.
These first two basic account organizations should get any account started. 
These organizations combine the basic principles of using the search network and the 
Display Network appropriately. However, they do assume that you are choosing only 
one geographic reach for all your campaigns. If you want to show different ads to dif-
ferent users, you may want to restructure your campaigns.

Meeting Location-Based Goals
There are times when you will want to create campaigns that showcase different ads 
or landing pages to users based on the user’s location. In some cases, your offer may 
change by location, or you find that when you include the user’s location in the ad and 
on the landing page, your conversion rates increase. This example looks at a company 
that should start with multiple location-based campaigns.
Our fictional company, Illinois Insurance, is licensed in the state of Illinois to 
sell insurance; therefore, they want only users in Illinois to see their ads. After conduct-
ing some research, they find that people located in Chicago have different insurance 
concerns than the rest of the state. Chicago is one of the largest cities in the world, and 
the residents want more information about car theft and home break-ins than the rest 
of the state. Illinois Insurance is headquartered in Rockford. They want to stress that 
customers in that city can come into their office and meet face to face with an insur-
ance agent.
This company has three different goals for three different locations (Illinois, 
Chicago, and Rockford); therefore, they will need three search-based campaigns 
(Figure 14.5).
Figure 14.5  Search-based campaigns for Illinois Insurance
Illinois Campaign  This campaign will be shown throughout the state of Illinois, so it 
should use the location setting of Illinois only. However, because Illinois Insurance 
wants different ads to show in Rockford and Chicago, the Excluded Regions feature 
(discussed in Chapter 11) should also be utilized to keep their ads from showing in 
those two cities. Since this campaign is shown only to users in the state of Illinois, the 

Chapter 14:  Orga n i zi ng Accou n ts Succe ssf u lly  ■
500
keywords will not need geo-qualifiers such as Peoria home insurance or Illinois home 
insurance. These ads will go to a landing page that corresponds to the keywords being 
searched.
Chicago Campaign  This campaign is for searchers who live in the city of Chicago; there-
fore, in the location settings this campaign should be displayed only in Chicago. Since 
the company found that Chicago users had different insurance concerns, those findings 
should be echoed in the ad copy. As with the Illinois campaign, the keywords should 
not use geographic modifiers. Finally, the searcher should be sent to a page on the web-
site that reinforces both the Chicago location and the keywords that were searched.
Rockford Campaign  The Rockford campaign should also use the location feature so its ads 
are just shown in Rockford. The keywords should not use geographic modifiers. Ads 
and landing pages should be focused on the benefit of sitting down face to face with an 
agent.
Geo-Keyword Campaign  If you want to reach everyone regardless of Google’s ability to 
understand a searcher’s location, you will want to add a fourth campaign that utilizes 
geographically modified keywords.
In this campaign, your target area will be the entire country. Then, within each ad 
group, you will use geographic keywords, such as Chicago home insurance or Peoria 
car insurance.
Each ad group should be a different city and insurance type combination. For the key-
words that use the Chicago modifier, the searcher should be sent to the same landing 
page that is being used in the Chicago campaign. The same goes for Rockford-based 
keywords.
For other geographic keywords, such as Peoria home insurance or Illinois home insur-
ance, you would want to send someone to an appropriate landing page that reinforces 
the geography and insurance type.
Note:  If your budget is being stretched by the first three campaigns, you could skip the geo-keyword 
campaign.
Display and Discovery Placement Campaigns  The big question this company needs to ask is how 
they want to treat the Display Network. There are a few options:
Option 1  Showcase the same ads to all of Illinois. If your budget is being 
stretched, creating multiple campaigns for each location can be an accounting 
nightmare. Use display and text ads to showcase your general offer to anyone 
on insurance content pages and send them to a page that showcases the rest of 
your offers. You could test a general benefit page against a segmentation page 
(discussed in Chapter 15, “Implementing Testing Techniques That Will Increase 

■  Dev elopi ng a Succe ssf u l Ca m pa ign St ruc t u r e
501
Profits”). In this case, turn on display only, use Illinois as your location target, 
and then refine your exposure by using a placement campaign for successful 
placements.
Option 2  Create three display campaigns using automatic placement type targets. 
Each display campaign will be shown to a different location: Rockford, Chicago, 
and Illinois (minus Rockford and Chicago). Then use managed placement cam-
paigns as you refine your exposure. The benefit of this method is targeted dis-
play exposure that sends a user to the most appropriate geographic landing page 
on the company’s website. However, it is a tremendous amount of work, and the 
results might not be worth the effort. In addition, you need to keep adding new 
daily budgets, which can start to reduce how much any one campaign is allowed 
to spend, essentially handicapping your best keywords and placements.
Option 3  Create a managed placement campaign only. Use the placement tool to 
find appropriate websites where your target audience spends time, and then put 
ads on those pages. Because you are guessing at placements, some of your ads 
will work and others will not. Use the placement performance report to remove 
websites or set appropriate bids. This method will not let you find random sites 
around the Web that would have been good placements for your ads, but it 
will let you test sites you feel are appropriate and keep greater control of your 
Display Network campaign budget.
Remarketing Campaign  Regardless of your choice of display targeting, this company could 
also create a remarketing campaign. If they do so, this campaign should be separate 
from the other campaigns.
In this particular campaign, the offers changed for each location, hence the 
need to create multiple campaigns. However, there are times when your offer does not 
change by location, but you want the users to feel that that your offer is local and you 
want to connect with the user on a location basis.
Multi-Location Campaigns
In this example, let us say that you are a national plumbing company. You have plumb-
ers in one hundred metro areas throughout the United States. In addition, every busi-
ness, including plumbers, can have hundreds of services, such as kitchen remodeling, 
bathroom remodeling, pipe repair, water heater installation, and frozen pipes, and the 
list goes on.
When you consider your geographies and services with respect to your ads and 
landing pages, you have a few options to think through:
••
Create one landing page per service.
••
Create one landing page per region.
••
Create one landing page per region and service.

Chapter 14:  Orga n i zi ng Accou n ts Succe ssf u lly  ■
502
••
Create ads per region.
••
Create ads per service.
••
Create ads for each region and service combination.
This leads to several combinations of ads and landing pages that you could uti-
lize. The absolute best combination would be to use geographic and service-based ads 
and landing pages. However, that is also by far the most work.
So in a case like this you first need to examine your resources to see if you can 
create and manage that many ads and landing pages. If you have those resources, fan-
tastic, feel free to build an account that way; however, many companies will not have 
those types of resources.
If you do not have those resources, then it is best to employ a few tests before 
choosing a structure:
••
Create a few campaigns that utilize geographic ads and landing pages.
••
Create a few campaigns that utilize service- and geographic-based ads with just 
service-based landing pages.
••
Create a few campaigns that utilize service-based ads and landing pages.
••
Create a few campaigns that utilize both service and location ads and landing pages.
Now, since these are all just tests, you probably will not create hundreds of ad 
groups for all of these campaigns. You will most likely just create a few of the higher 
search volume items because what you need to determine is how much the geography 
affects the CTR and conversion rates.
Once you run these tests for a while, closely examine the data. How much does 
it matter that the geography is in the ad or on the landing page? How much does it 
matter that the service is in the ad or on the landing page? How much of an increase in 
CTR and conversion rates did you receive from utilizing both services and geographies 
in the ads and landing pages?
To answer these questions, you will need to export the data and run the num-
bers to see the differences. However, once you do so, you can pick the combination 
that does the best for you, or you will have the data to put together a pitch to the com-
pany of why they should invest a certain amount of money to create the best combina-
tion based on the data.
In this example, it is not just about laying out the best possibility. It is also about 
examining how to think about testing the structures and putting together numbers to 
make the case for your organization and resources. You might have 100 cities and 50 
services, which would be a potential 5000 landing pages, a large undertaking. In this 
example, since the geographies are at the metro level, all of the ad groups will have 
some search volume. However, if this company was not national but instead just serv-
ing a single metro area, you can take the basics of this structure but create a hyper local 
campaign setup, which is not quite as complex as national companies have to employ.

Hyper Local Campaigns
A hyper local campaign is one where you are serving a small region, such as a state or 
single metro area, but you want still want to make the users feel as if you are talking to 
their specific area. For instance, the metro area of Chicago comprises 233 cities. Some 
of these cities contain more than 100,000 people and others have fewer than 10,000.
When you examine the search volume for these smaller cities, what you usually 
find is that the generic words, such as Naperville plumber, have some search volume, 
but the very specific words, such as Kitchen Remodeling in Naperville, IL, have very 
little search volume.
Therefore, if you wanted to be as specific as possible in your ads, yet not do 
additional work due to the low search volume, you could create two search campaigns:
Services Campaign  The services campaign will serve ads to the entire Chicago metro 
region. The ads will use Chicago in them, and the ad groups will be very specific (for 
example, kitchen remodeling, clogged drain, and the like), and each ad group should 
ideally have its own landing page that mentions the service. Since this campaign is tar-
geting only Chicago, the keywords do not need geographic modifiers (such as Chicago 
kitchen remodeling).
Geo Campaign  The second campaign will also target the Chicago metro; however, each 
ad group will represent a single city within the metro area. In addition, there will be 
only one ad group for each city, and these ad groups will use the higher-volume generic 
terms, such as Naperville plumber or Joliet plumber. Ideally, these ads would lead to 
landing pages that mention the specific geography, but in a worst-case scenario, they 
can go to a page that mentions the service area as well as the overall services.
Many of these ad groups will not receive impressions, and that is okay. The goal here is 
to ensure that if someone is doing a hyper local search, you can show hyper local ads. 
If any ad group does start to receive a significant amount of impressions, then you can 
create a services campaign for that city.
For instance, in Figure 14.6, each ad group represents a city within the Houston metro 
area. The city of Sugar Land has received a significant amount of impressions, espe-
cially compared to the other small cities in that region, and therefore would warrant its 
own services campaign.
This is a nice setup for a local business that wants to follow best practices 
around having highly localized ads but may not have the resources to create hundreds 
of pages and is working with a geography where many of the cities might not even have 
search volume. This type of structure is easy to set up, and then you can let the search 
volume dictate where you might create additional campaigns for specific geographies.
While these campaigns have been focused on locations for the purposes of show-
ing ads, there will also be times when you might localize your campaigns for other 
reasons.

Case Study into Geographic Organization for CPA Purposes
Before bid modifiers were introduced, we would sometimes organize national cam-
paigns around geographies for bidding purposes. The ads and landing pages would be 
the same for each geography, such as those often found in e-commerce sites, but they 
were broken down based on the performance in each region (Figure 14.7).
The reason our target CPA is different for the various campaigns is that in the 
low-performing areas if we try to use our blended CPA average, our position falls so 
much that we lose a lot of conversions and visibility. We do not want to ignore these 
areas completely, so we are willing to have slightly higher CPAs in these regions to 
maintain some conversions and visibility in those areas.
In these tests, in some cases CPC bidding was used, and in other cases CPA bid-
ding was used. With the introduction of bid modifiers, I wanted to test what would 
happen if we consolidated these campaigns into a single campaign and used bid modi-
fiers for the CPC campaigns. Because bid modifiers, other than –100 percent for mobile 
devices, do not work for CPA campaigns, this was a test to see how this bid method 
would work for consolidated campaigns. This case study involved several lead-genera-
tion and e-commerce sites.

■  Dev elopi ng a Succe ssf u l Ca m pa ign St ruc t u r e
505
Figure 14.7  Geographic CPA organization
When we consolidated the CPC-based campaigns into a single campaign and 
used bid modifiers to manipulate the bid based on the CPA for each region, we ended 
up with very positive results:
••
Lead generation: 7.9 percent reduction in CPAs
••
E-commerce: 7.1 percent reduction in CPAs
The reason for the performance gain was that it was very easy with bid modi-
fiers to set custom bids for every single region, whereas with the campaigns, creating a 
new campaign for every region was resource prohibitive.
For the campaign that was utilizing CPA bidding, the results were not as great:
••
Lead generation: 13.9 percent increase in CPAs
••
E-commerce: 11.4 percent increase in CPAs
Since you cannot set bid modifiers for CPA campaigns, you are at the mercy of 
how AdWords is setting your bids. While I find that CPA bidding is a very useful bid 
method and like to employ it on many occasions, I do find it is often not aggressive 
enough in changing bids based on location conversion-rate differences, and I do like to 
often separate out campaigns into different geographies based on the conversion rates 
and target CPAs for each geography.
This leads to the other point you should think about with organization: what 
bid method do you want to use? If you want to use CPA bidding and you do not have 
a high budget, then you will often want fewer campaigns so you can consolidate your 

Chapter 14:  Orga n i zi ng Accou n ts Succe ssf u lly  ■
506
conversions into a single campaign. If you are going to bid manually, then you do not 
have to worry about consolidating your conversions as much because you can set bids 
and use bid modifiers at will in campaigns that do not have many conversions.
The campaign organizations just discussed have been focused on having the 
ability to set bids based on ROAS or profit. However, there are times when you want to 
expand consumers’ awareness of your website.
Creating Awareness or Branding Search Campaigns
There will be times when you like certain keywords, and those keywords accurately 
describe your products or services. If those keywords also lead to brand interaction—
such as page views, low bounce rates, or video watches—yet by themselves do not con-
vert for your primary conversion actions, you have three options.
The first option is to delete the keywords. If you are running a campaign strictly 
around profits and ROAS and these keywords are not performing, get rid of them.
Note:  Please note that just because a keyword does not lead directly to good ROAS does not mean it is not 
profitable. Keep in mind the keyword attribution funnel discussed in Chapter 13.
The first option is not great if you have a long sales cycle or want to introduce 
new people to your buying funnel. Searches from people in the early stages of the buy-
ing funnel have lower conversion rates. Therefore, the second option is to create some 
monetary value for a page view or video view, and then bid by returns for those alter-
nate conversions.
The last option is to create a branding campaign. This can also be called an 
awareness campaign because that is one of the first steps in the buying funnel. Your 
best option is to also track if these individuals convert at a later date so that you can 
see the full keyword attribution funnel. However, before you can see if they convert, 
you need the searchers to find your website. For these keywords, you should not care 
which ones get clicks. Your goal is to introduce people to your website.
To create this branding campaign, follow these steps:
	 1.	
Move all the keywords that you want to gain exposure into a separate campaign 
with the appropriate ad group organization.
	 2.	
Set a daily budget for how much you are willing to pay for people to find your 
website and learn more about your company.
	 3.	
Use the Maximize Clicks bidding strategy:
••
The Maximize Clicks selection attempts to maximize the number of clicks 
that a campaign receives. It does not care which keyword received the 
click—which is why you should not move keywords into this campaign if 
you know the returns for any of them.

■  Dev elopi ng a Succe ssf u l Ca m pa ign St ruc t u r e
507
••
In addition, the budget optimizer’s maximum CPC should be set lower than 
any of the keywords in your search campaigns. If you know the returns 
for a keyword, you want your search campaign’s keywords to be triggered. 
Maximize Clicks campaigns are for words that do not convert but for which 
you want exposure, and they are usually less valuable than your search 
keywords.
When you have finished creating the branding campaign, you will still have your 
typical search and display campaigns as mentioned in the basic campaign structures for 
both search and display; this will just be an additional search campaign.
All of the organizations so far have been focused on showing the ads every 
day of the week and at all hours of the day. If you want your ads to show on differ-
ent days of the week or at different times of the day, you need to utilize ad scheduling 
campaigns.
Showing Different Ads by Day of the Week
Marketing is about connecting with customers. With AdWords, the first connection 
point is with keywords. A second one can occur if you use the day of the week, or even 
the time of day, in an ad.
Most restaurants and bars have different specials each day of the week. If a 
restaurant wanted to put their daily special into their ads for the weekdays and then 
highlight one weekend special, there is an easy way to accomplish this with ad schedul-
ing (discussed in Chapter 13) by using a different campaign for each day of the week 
(Figure 14.8), as follows:
Figure 14.8  Ad scheduling campaign organization
	 1.	
Build your ad groups within a single campaign. If you are a restaurant, also set 
the location targeting based on the city in which you are located.

Chapter 14:  Orga n i zi ng Accou n ts Succe ssf u lly  ■
508
	 2.	
Duplicate your campaign six times using the AdWords Editor (featured in 
Chapter 12, “Saving Time and Scaling Accounts with the AdWords Editor”). 
Name each campaign for a day of the week or weekend. The naming convention 
is for your organizational purposes; a campaign’s name does not affect any of its 
data points.
	 3.	
Choose what day of the week you want that campaign to be active. When using 
ad scheduling, always look at the time zone for your account. You can view your 
account’s time zone on the ad-scheduling interface. Assuming that the time zone 
for the account is in the same time zone as your target area, the first campaign 
would be set to run only on Mondays, the Tuesday campaign would run only on 
Tuesdays, and so on.
	 4.	
Go back into the AdWords Editor and download your account. In each cam-
paign, change the ads so that they showcase both the day of the week that the 
campaign is active and the specials for that day. Upload the changes, check 
those changes in the interface, and then you will have custom ads for each day 
of the week.
You can also use ad scheduling to change your bids automatically throughout 
the day. If you run a restaurant, and you find that most people are looking for driving 
directions and the ability to reserve tables in the late afternoon, you may want to raise 
your bids at those times and then leave them the same or lower at other times of the 
day. Using ad scheduling to reach consumers with time-sensitive ads, or changing bids 
by conversion rates, is a good method to help increase your profits.
Organizing Campaigns Based on Goals or Budgets
If you have different budgets for different goals on your website, organizing your cam-
paigns based on how much you want to spend for each goal is a good way of control-
ling costs. In addition, you can use campaign negative keywords to help segment traffic 
so the searcher sees the proper ad.
For this example, we are going to examine a timeshare company. TS Inc. is our 
fictional company, which has a website based on buying and selling timeshares.
TS Inc. makes money only when they sell an ad to someone who is looking to 
sell their timeshare. If you want to sell your timeshare, you can connect with one of 
their sales reps, and they will walk you through the advertising options so you can get 
your timeshare listed on their site and hopefully sell it.
However, TS Inc. has found that they need to drive traffic to the listings sec-
tions of their timeshares for those who are looking to buy. The sales reps like to tell 
prospective advertisers how much traffic each section of their site receives, because it 
helps increase conversion rates of their ad sales. But when TS Inc. drives traffic to the 
timeshare listings, they do not make any money. Although they need to drive traffic to 

■  Dev elopi ng a Succe ssf u l Ca m pa ign St ruc t u r e
509
their listings sections to help make sales, it’s a loss leader; they have to pay for traffic 
but they do not directly make any money on these clicks.
TS Inc. wants to spend a lot of money when someone is looking to sell a time-
share and is bidding based on their sales close rates. They have a lower budget when 
someone is looking to buy a timeshare. They also have a budget for those who are not 
decisive in their search query and just use a keyword such as Aruba timeshare; TS Inc. 
and TS Inc. does not know whether that user wants to buy or sell a listing.
To accomplish their goals, and to send a user to the correct place on their web-
site, they have devised three campaigns based on their budgets (Figure 14.9):
Figure 14.9  TS Inc. campaign strategy to separate campaigns by marketing objectives
Buy a Timeshare  The first campaign is reaching consumers who want to buy a timeshare. 
Since TS Inc. does not make money on these keywords, they have the lowest of their 
daily budgets in this campaign. Each ad group is a combination of a city name with the 
word timeshare and the word buy (Buy Aruba Timeshares). The keywords inside the ad 
group all have buying descriptors such as “buy,” “buying,” “purchase,” and so on.
TS Inc. has found that they need to use broad match to reach all their prospects. 
However, since they do not make money on the keywords in this campaign, they want 
to make sure that the consumer searching is using the word buy and does not use the 
word sell because they can monetize someone looking to sell a timeshare by selling 
them an ad. At the campaign level, they use all the variations of the word sell in their 
negative keyword list (discussed in Chapter 2, “Performing Keyword Research”). By 
using negative keywords, they segment traffic based on their marketing goals.

Chapter 14:  Orga n i zi ng Accou n ts Succe ssf u lly  ■
510
Sell Timeshares  This is the campaign that makes TS Inc. the most money. When someone 
wants to sell their timeshare, TS Inc. wants to sell that person an ad on their website. 
The ad groups in this campaign are very similar to the first campaign, except the buy-
based keyword qualifiers are changed to sell qualifiers. For instance, the keyword 
Buy Aruba Timeshare from the buy campaign would be Sell Aruba Timeshare in this 
campaign.
Since the goal for this campaign is conversions through selling ads, all of the traffic is 
sent to a page that shows how TS Inc. can help you sell your timeshare and provides a 
quick form for you to fill out to get in contact with a sales representative. For higher 
conversion rates, each landing page features the location in the headline, such as 
“Contact Us to Sell Your Aruba Timeshare” along with a picture of the location.
Finally, to help segment traffic into selling versus buying intent, TS Inc. uses negative 
keywords such as buy and buying at the campaign level. This helps keep their lead 
quality higher and gives their listings sections more page views for those with a buying 
intent.
Timeshares  The third campaign is for those searchers who do not use either buying or 
selling qualifiers. These searchers just type in Aruba timeshare. Since TS Inc. does not 
know if these searchers are looking to buy or sell a timeshare, the users are sent to a 
segmentation page where they are presented with two options of where to go next. If 
someone clicks on the “Sell your timeshare” link, they are sent to the contact form 
used in the Sell a Timeshare campaign. If someone clicks on the “Buy a timeshare” 
link, they are sent to the listings page from the Buy a Timeshare campaign.
TS Inc. finds they receive quite a bit of traffic from these listings, and since some of the 
traffic is monetizable from selling these consumers ads, this campaign has the second-
highest daily budget, after the Sell Timeshares campaign.
Since the intent is ambiguous, and some users leave the segmentation page immediately, 
these searches are worthless to TS Inc. Therefore, all the keywords in this campaign 
have lower maximum CPCs than the keywords in either of the first two campaigns.
TS Inc. wants to make sure that users end up at the correct section of their website, so 
they use all of the campaign negatives from the first two campaigns for this campaign. 
It is worth noting that with this structure, they would not have any ads that would 
show for a keyword query such as buy and sell timeshares due to their negative cam-
paign keyword usage.
In this example, we used a website that is both the seller and the distributor of 
their own ads. There should be two takeaways from this section. The first is that if you 
have various objectives for your website, and you want the various objectives to have 
different marketing dollars, you need to use your campaign organization to help you 
reach those goals. The second concerns user intent. Often you will find that you are 
willing to pay more if a user knows what they want or is more specific in their search 

■  Dev elopi ng a Succe ssf u l Ca m pa ign St ruc t u r e
511
query. If you can define the various intents of those who use your keywords, you can 
design campaigns and ad groups based on what the searcher is looking to find.
Defining Your Goals
A complex campaign structure is not difficult if you can define your goals. For the final 
example, we will examine the goals of a national e-commerce company that focuses on 
selling computers. Because this is a large company, their goals are diverse:
••
Showcase offers to all of the United States and bids by ROI for both search and 
display.
••
Increase number of searchers finding their website for the first time.
••
Create demand for their goods on nonsearch sites with highly targeted ads.
After examining their geographic performance reports (Chapter 11), they found 
they have low performance in Chicago. To increase performance in Chicago, they also 
want to test a B2B-focused ad on weekdays and a B2C-focused ad on weekends.
Showcase offers to all of the United States and bids by ROAS for both search and display.  This goal 
speaks to the basic campaign structure covered earlier in the section “Basic Campaign 
Structure to Maximize Display Returns.” They start with search and managed place-
ment campaigns. Since the second goal is to showcase a different offer to Chicago 
users, they will use the excluded regions feature in their search campaign so this cam-
paign is not shown in Chicago.
Increase number of searchers finding their website for the first time.  This company has found that 
the buying cycle for new computers can be quite long. However, if they can reach a 
searcher early in the buying funnel, often that consumer will stay focused with their 
company as they move down through the funnel to a purchase. Therefore, they have a 
large list of keywords that are relevant to their products but are in the interest or learn-
ing phase of the buying cycle; the company has had a difficult time determining bids 
because the words do not directly lead to sales. These keywords will be placed in an 
awareness campaign.
This awareness campaign will use the Maximize Clicks feature to maximize the clicks 
that the company receives for these keywords. The company will still try to get these 
consumers to subscribe to newsletters and learn more about their products; however, 
they are also measuring interaction with their website and will remove keywords that 
don’t contribute to it. They will also measure how many of these consumers buy at a 
later date. If any keyword starts to receive a significant number of conversions, that 
keyword will be moved to the search campaign that uses maximum CPC bidding.
Create demand for their goods on nonsearch sites with highly targeted ads.  This company would 
like to place ads on highly desirable review-based websites so that more people become 
aware of their brand. To accomplish this, they will use a placement targeted cam-
paign with only image and video ads. In addition, since their goal is the ad view, the 

Chapter 14:  Orga n i zi ng Accou n ts Succe ssf u lly  ■
512
campaign will utilize CPM bidding (cost per thousand impressions) instead of CPC 
bidding.
The company will measure this campaign’s success by examining the changes in 
branded queries, the number of people who watch a video, and changes to overall con-
version rates on the website.
Test a B2B-focused ad on weekdays and a B2C-focused ad on weekends.  To reach this goal, they are 
going to use both location targeting and ad scheduling. The company should create 
two new campaigns that target only Chicago.
The first campaign will use ad scheduling to show their ads only on weekdays. Because 
weekdays often contain more B2B-focused searches, they are going to write ads that 
use a B2B benefit message. They will send those searchers to a B2B-focused page on 
how the company helps other businesses that are buying multiple computers save time 
and money with their enterprise services.
The second campaign will use ad scheduling to show their ads only on weekends. 
Because they are trying to reach more consumers who want to purchase new comput-
ers, these ads will focus on the consumer benefits of buying a new computer. These ads 
will lead to a consumer-focused landing page.
After the company has gone through the exercise of determining their goals and 
how to structure their campaigns to meet those goals, they create a chart (Figure 14.10) 
so they can visually understand their campaign’s organization.
Figure 14.10  Complex campaign organization that meets the company’s goals
Proper campaign organization can determine the success or failure of your mar-
keting goals. List the goals you want your marketing to achieve. Then examine all the 
options that AdWords gives you to help you reach those goals. Once you understand 

■  Orga n i zi ng a n A d Grou p to I ncr e ase C T R a n d Con v ersion R at e s
513
all the features in AdWords, you can create complex campaign structures that will help 
you reach your goals.
A campaign tells Google where, how, and when to show your ads. It does not 
inform Google which keyword, ad copy, and landing page should be used. The next 
step to a successful campaign is properly organizing your ad groups in a campaign.
Organizing an Ad Group to Increase CTR and Conversion Rates
An ad group is a collection of keywords and ads. Any ad can show for any keyword in 
an ad group. It is essential that all ad copy properly reflect each keyword. This topic is 
covered in depth in Chapter 7, “Demystifying Quality Score.”
You should always ask yourself a few questions for each keyword you use in a 
search campaign:
••
Does the searcher think the page reached after clicking on your ad will answer 
their question?
••
Can you write an ad that is more related to this keyword?
••
If you look at the other ads, is there one that is more closely related to the key-
word than yours?
A simple exercise to go through is to write a highly targeted ad, an ad so specific 
that if a searcher sees it, they assume you offer only one item. Then ask yourself, does 
that ad describe the keyword? If yes, the keyword is in the correct ad group. If no, the 
keyword needs to go to a new ad group.
Going through this exercise and applying it to your keywords should lead to 
higher Quality Scores, higher click-through rates, and higher conversion rates. The 
process is time consuming but essential.
Once you have created relevant ad groups and have accumulated some data, 
run the search query report. This report is indispensable if you use broad and phrase 
match. It will help you identify negative keywords, add new keywords, and even help 
organize your ad groups.
For instance, if a hosting company wants to advertise with AdWords, they will 
have a host of ad groups, such as these:
••
Hosting
••
Website hosting
••
Cheap hosting
••
VPS hosting
••
Cheap VPS hosting
Assuming that the keywords within the ad group are highly related to the ad 
group names and that you are using modified broad match, you can easily run into ad-
serving issues. For instance, if someone were to search for cheap vps website hosting, 

Chapter 14:  Orga n i zi ng Accou n ts Succe ssf u lly  ■
514
every single ad group could be displayed. The query contains the word hosting, so the 
first ad group could be shown. The query contains VPS hosting, so the VPS hosting ad 
group could get triggered. The query contains cheap hosting, so the cheap hosting ad 
group could show, and so forth.
In most cases, Google does try to show the most specific keyword to the query; 
however, they will calculate ad rank for all your eligible matches and show the highest 
ad rank.
When you have scenarios like this, use negative keywords to ensure the correct 
ad is being shown (Figure 14.11).
Figure 14.11  Using negative keywords to control ad display
When you layer in negative ad group keywords in this manner, you are forcing 
AdWords to show the most specific keyword for the query. If your ads and landing 
pages also contain information about that query, this should increase not only your ad 
serving control but your CTR and conversion rates as well.
By using a combination of positive and negative keywords, you can ensure that 
the correct ad copy and keyword are triggered in your account when someone conducts 
a search that matches one of your keywords.
For organizing ad groups for display campaigns, please refer to Chapter 9, 
“Understanding the Display Network,” in particular the section “Creating Keyword-
Based Display Ad Groups.”
The ideal scenario is to create ad copy and a landing page for each search query 
where the ad and landing page are specific to every keyword query conducted. While 

■  Orga n i zi ng a n A d Grou p to I ncr e ase C T R a n d Con v ersion R at e s
515
that might be ideal, there is no way to accomplish that organization with a medium-
sized account, let alone a large account.
To create effective ad groups, always think back to the search intent of any given 
query. If your keyword, ad copy, and landing page work together to answer the search-
er’s question, your organization is on the correct path.
Ad Group Organization for Mobile Bid Modifiers
The only search bid modifier that can be applied at the ad group level is the mobile bid 
modifier. Because many keywords will have different conversion rates based on the 
device type, you may end up splitting your highly targeted ad groups into even more ad 
groups based on the mobile bid modifier that you want to use.
For instance, let us examine some example data (Table 14.1).
▶

$53
First off, this is an example for illustration purposes; in reality, there would be 
more ad groups because we would want different ads for someone who is searching for 
a general accountant than for someone who is searching for specific software or legal 
tax help.
In this example, the first two keywords have similar CPAs on both devices. The 
next two keywords perform better on mobile devices than on desktops, and the last 
two keywords have better CPAs on desktops than on mobile devices.
In this scenario, we would not want to bid the last four keywords, the ones with 
drastically different mobile and desktop CPAs, the same way. We would want a posi-
tive bid modifier to raise our bids on the keywords that do better on mobile devices, 
and we would want to lower our mobile bids on keywords that are performing worse 
on mobile devices. For the words that are roughly the same for each device, we can 
leave them in the same ad group.
This leads us to having to split this ad group into three different ad groups based 
on the mobile bid modifiers we want to use. When you start advertising on both mobile 
and desktop devices, you will want to keep an eye out for any CPA and ROAS differ-
ences to see if you need to add another level of ad group segmentation to your overall 
organization in order to use mobile bid modifiers appropriately.

Best Practices for Account Organization Strategies
Google AdWords gives you a tremendous amount of control in determining the condi-
tions in which your ad is eligible for the auction. You have control over many items, 
such as these:
••
Keywords
••
Negative keywords
••
Match types
••
Geography
••
Time of day
••
Day of the week
••
Devices
••
Google search
••
Search partners
••
Placement targeting
••
Remarketing
••
Specific placement if the article contains your keywords
••
Bidding type (Budget Optimizer, maximum CPC, Conversion Optimizer, CPM)
••
Budget
There are so many options that it can become overwhelming when you are try-
ing to figure out all the combinations, where you would like your ad to be displayed, 
and how much you want to pay for each of those clicks or impressions. To ensure your 
account is organized properly, follow these best-practice techniques:
••
First determine your business goals. You cannot be successful if you do not 
understand what your marketing needs to accomplish.
••
Next, learn all of the targeting options available through AdWords.
••
Once you have a grasp of the first two points, create a map of your campaigns, 
keeping in mind that each campaign must have a budget and that you do not 
want to make it too small so that it cannot get enough exposure.
••
Also keep in mind your bidding options. If you want to use CPA bidding and 
you have a small budget, then you will often want to use fewer campaigns to 
consolidate your conversions so you can employ that bid method.
••
For each campaign, create ad groups that meet the campaign’s objective.
••
For search campaigns, all keywords and ad copy need to be closely related.

In the next chapter, you will explore testing strategies for your ads and landing 
pages. First, we will look at different types of ad copy along with methodologies for 
testing those ads. Once you have obtained the click, you need the visitor to conduct an 
action on your website. We will then examine how to test where to send the traffic on 
your website along with how to test different landing pages so you can find ad copy 
and landing page combinations that lead to higher conversion rates.

Implementing Testing 
Techniques That Will 
Increase Profits
Testing is an essential component when optimiz-
ing any AdWords account. You should test both 
ads and landing pages to see what combinations 
improve the effectiveness of your account.
In this chapter, you will learn how to test 
ads, as well as how to test landing pages, where 
to send traffic, and how to lay out different types 
of landing pages to increase conversion rates.
Finally, this chapter will show you how to 
test ads and landing pages in conjunction with 
each other. Profit per impression is a metric that 
will let you find the most profitable combination 
of ads and landing pages that you should use in 
your AdWords account.

Testing Is Essential to Increasing Profits
Throughout this book, you have seen best practices for researching keywords, writing 
ads, and designing landing pages. But what if you have two or more ideas that seem 
as if they could be successful? That is where testing comes into play. You can test your 
ideas to see which ones lead to higher profits.
Testing is a crucial part of account optimization. Once you have created your 
AdWords account, it will start to accumulate metrics that will show you how success-
ful your account currently is. You can improve these metrics over time by testing vari-
ous ads and landing pages.
It is easy to impose your own will and designs when writing ads and creating 
landing pages. However, you are not your target market. Your target market will usu-
ally know less than you do about your products and your business. Therefore, when-
ever you say, “I think we should do it this way,” when writing ads or designing your 
website, you need to test the ideas to see if consumers agree with you.
If marketing thinks a website should look one way, your IT department thinks it 
should look a different way, and the CEO wants to splatter the corporate logo all over 
the website, there is an easy solution. Create three landing pages and see which ones 
lead to higher profits. It is hard to argue with profits.
You should let consumers tell you what is best for them. The easiest way to do 
this is to test your ideas. The two major elements you can test are ads and landing 
pages. Let’s begin by examining the various types of ads you can test.
Testing Ad Copy to Increase Conversions
There are three main ways to test ads: the unique approach, multi-ad group testing, 
and the methodical approach.
Unique Approach  With the unique approach, you will write a few different ad types. For 
example, you may write one ad with prices, another that uses testimonials, and a third 
that answers a question. When you use this method, each ad will have completely dif-
ferent components than the other ads you are testing. This is a good way to determine 
which type of ad resonates best with your customers.
With this approach, it is also useful to see what types of ads your competitors are using 
and then test both their ad type and a completely different one. This will let you see 
how consumers in your industry are responding to different messages.
Multi-Ad Group Testing Approach  There are times you will not have enough impressions and 
clicks for each ad in an ad group to achieve statistical significance in a reasonable test-
ing time frame. There will be other times when an account is so large that you cannot 
write ads for every ad group. In these scenarios, the multi-ad group testing approach is 
the best method to use. With this method, you will write ads across multiple ad groups 
that share components, such as multiple ad groups that will utilize the exact same 

■  A d Copy T h em e s to Spa r k You r Cr e at i v i t y
521
description in line 2 calls to action in two or more ads. Then you will aggregate the 
data at the ad copy line to see which call to action works best across your account.
Methodical Approach  In this scenario, you will write two or three headlines, description 
line 1s, description line 2s, and then mix and match them. If you have three headlines, 
description line 1s, and description line 2s, once you mix and match those ad compo-
nents you will have 27 combinations. This is not the place to start. You need a signifi-
cant amount of traffic to test 27 combinations. You may move to this approach at a 
later date once you have determined what type of ads and messages work best for your 
consumers, but do not start with this approach.
Before you can run a test, you need at least two different ads. Next let’s exam-
ine various ad copy messages so you can identify the ones that resonate with your 
audience.
Ad Copy Messages You Should Test
There are various types of ads that will help you connect with your consumer base. 
Not all of these will resonate with your customers, which is why you need to test your 
ideas to see which ones increase profits. Chapter 4, “Writing Compelling Ads,” dis-
cussed these ad formats:
••
Numbers, prices, and discounts
••
Calls to action
••
Informational
••
Question
••
Testimonials and reviews
••
Negative messages
••
Display URLs
In this section I will introduce you to some more ads types you can test. 
Understanding message types is essential, not just for testing but to know what your 
competitors are doing as well.
Ad Copy Themes to Spark Your Creativity
You can test ad copy themes to see which resonate best for people looking at your ads. 
You may find that certain types of ads perform differently depending on where some-
one is in the buying funnel.
Tip:  Ad copy is the only part of your account that a searcher ever sees. Your ad has only seconds to grab the 
searcher’s attention, connect with them, and direct them to click on your ad to visit your website. If your ad fails to 
deliver visitors to your website, designing exceptional landing pages is a waste of time since they will never be seen.

Chapter 15:  I m plem en t i ng T e st i ng T ech n iqu e s T h at W i ll I ncr e ase Prof i ts  ■
522
For instance, for those who are in the early stages of the buying funnel, informa-
tional ads often do better than review-based ads. However, someone who is compari-
son shopping may like review-based ads more than informational ads.
You can also mix different themes within a single ad. For instance, you can use 
an informational description on line 1 and a call to action description on line 2 in the 
same text ad.
Test Discounts Instead of Prices
In Chapter 4, we explored the psychology of numbers and how a new ad can influence 
consumers’ perception of prices. However, if you are not price competitive for some 
reason, instead of adding prices to your ads, you could test discounts (Figure 15.1).
Figure 15.1  Ad copy using discounts
If your prices are constantly changing and requiring you to change your ads, 
you may want to use discounts instead of prices in the ad copy. The reason for this is 
that each time you modify an existing ad, you are actually deleting that ad and creat-
ing a new one; because all new ads must go through editorial approval before they are 
shown on search partners’ or Display Network sites, this means that you are reducing 
your potential exposure.
Note:  Although discounts will often increase conversion rates, they may not increase profits. You should 
examine the dollars lost from giving a discount compared to the additional revenue gained from selling more items 
to determine if you want to use discounts in your ads.
There are other items you can test, such as using geographic components or 
dynamic keyword insertion in your ads.
Geographic Ad Copy  Are your customers locals or nonlocals? Always consider how much infor-
mation someone has about an area when using that area in your ad copy (Figure 15.2):
••
When someone moves to Chicago, the first decision they make is whether they 
want to live in North or South Chicago. The first ad does not help someone 
reach that decision. Therefore, if someone has just decided to move to Chicago, 
it is a bad ad. However, if someone has decided they want to live in North 
Chicago, then the ad copy has meaning for the searcher. Therefore, this is bad 

■  A d Copy T h em e s to Spa r k You r Cr e at i v i t y
523
ad copy when someone is in the informational phase of the buying funnel but 
good ad copy if they are farther down in the funnel.
••
The second ad related to the hotel has good ad copy for a nonlocal. A nonlocal 
wants to be reassured you are in the correct location. Since most hotel bookings 
are for nonlocals, you can make some assumptions about your audience.
••
The third ad uses good ad copy if you are a physical business trying to get peo-
ple to walk into your store. A precise location, the Water Tower, is used in the 
copy. However, this is a bad nonlocal ad because most people outside of Chicago 
do not know where the Water Tower is located.
Figure 15.2  Geographic ad copy
The more a user knows, the more precise your ad can be. Always consider the knowl-
edge of your audience when writing any ads, especially location-based ads.
Dynamic Keyword Insertion  In Chapter 6, “Learning Advanced Optimization Techniques,” 
I discussed dynamic keyword insertion, which automatically changes your ad to 
include a keyword from your ad group based on the search query. Testing keyword 
insertion is simple. Write a couple of ads. In the first group, do not use dynamic inser-
tion. Duplicate the ads and use dynamic insertion in the second set (Figure 15.3).
Figure 15.3  Dynamic keyword insertion ads

Chapter 15:  I m plem en t i ng T e st i ng T ech n iqu e s T h at W i ll I ncr e ase Prof i ts  ■
524
The use of keyword insertion does not always increase both click-through rate and con-
version rate. It commonly increases click-through rate but not always; it may not affect 
conversion rates at all, and in some cases, it can actually decrease them.
Be Creative in Writing Ad Copy
When choosing what type of messaging to use in your ad copy, you should always 
keep the landing page in mind since the ad copy sets the expectation for what will be 
found after the click. Creating synergies with the landing page is essential to writing 
successful ad copy. For instance, if you used a testimonial in your ad copy, you should 
echo that call to action on the landing page. By using the same elements in the ad and 
the landing page, you ensure that the ad copy and landing page will work together 
to increase conversion rates. This same principle applies to testimonial or review ads 
(Figure 15.4).
Figure 15.4  Reinforcing testimonials on the landing page
Because your ad copy initially connected with the searcher—it’s why your ad 
was clicked—reinforcing that same message on the landing page will tell the consumer 
they are in the right place and the information presented is exactly what they were 
looking to find.

One-line vs. two-line ad copy
When working with AdWords, most of your time is spent in spreadsheets 
crunching numbers. Writing ad copy is a good time to use the right side of your brain. 
The left side of the brain is focused on logic and facts. The right side of the brain is 
much more creative and emotional. Ad copy should connect emotionally with individu-
als, so using the creative side of your brain to write ad copy can help you reach your 
target market. 
Creating the Ad Copy Test
When starting with the unique ad approach, write a few different types of ads. For 
instance, write one informational ad, one with dynamic keyword insertion, and 
another that uses a discount. Do not forget to mix and match some of these concepts. 
For instance, you can use dynamic keyword insertion in an informational ad or a call 
to action in a geographic ad.
The next step in running a test is to specify how Google decides which ad from 
an ad group to display.
Ensure Your Ads Receive Equal Exposure
There are four ways that Google will display the ads in the ad groups for your cam-
paigns: Optimize For Clicks, Optimize For Conversions, Rotate Evenly, and Rotate 
Indefinitely.
Optimize For Clicks  When Optimize For Clicks is enabled, Google will determine which of 
your ads has the highest click-through rate. Over time, they will show the ad with the 
higher CTR more often than the other ads in that ad group. Eventually, you may see 
one ad receiving 95 percent of all impressions for an ad group.
Optimize For Conversions  When Optimize For Conversions is enabled, Google will pre-
dict which of your ads will have highest conversion rate and show that ad more often. 
Although this might seem like a great setting, it does not care about your CTR. 

Chapter 15:  I m plem en t i ng T e st i ng T ech n iqu e s T h at W i ll I ncr e ase Prof i ts  ■
526
Therefore, you might have an ad with a very high conversion rate show often, but if its 
CTR is too low, you might rarely receive visitors from the ad to your site.
Rotate Evenly  With this setting enabled, Google will rotate the ads in an ad group evenly 
for 90 days. After 90 days, they will then show the ads with the highest CTR the most. 
If you ever change an ad in an ad group, it does reset the 90-day clock for how the 
ads will be rotated in that ad group. One of the major downsides of this setting is that 
you cannot tell which ad group is being rotated evenly and which is having the highest 
CTR ads shown the most often. 
Rotate Indefinitely  When you have the Rotate Indefinitely option enabled, Google will 
attempt to show your ads evenly and give your ads equal distribution.
When you enable either of the rotate options, you will find that the ads do not receive 
exactly equal impressions. This is due to the complexity of Google’s system and how 
they serve ads across many geographies and time zones. It is not uncommon to see that 
ad 1 has 450 impressions, ad 2 has 350 impressions, and ad 3 has 475 impressions. The 
ads will have similar but not exact impression volume.
Ad-Serving Considerations
The bidding method you choose sets the bid; it does not serve the ad. If you are using Conversion 
Optimizer, it will try to determine what a keyword’s conversion rate and average CPA are for setting 
the bid, but it does not choose to show the ad with the highest conversion rate. If you are focused 
on just conversions, using the bid option Conversion Optimizer and ad delivery setting of Optimize 
For Conversions is a good choice. If you are also taking into account average order value, profit per 
impression (discussed later in this chapter), or other metrics, you should still use Rotate Indefinitely or 
AdWords Campaign Experiments (also discussed later in this chapter) to serve your ads.
If your goal is to improve your conversion rate, increase your return on ad spend 
(ROAS), or find the ad with the highest profit, you do not want to use the Optimize For 
Clicks setting; doing so only maximizes CTR. In these cases, you want to enable the 
Rotate Indefinitely feature. To do so, navigate to your Campaign settings. Under Advanced 
Settings, open the Ad Delivery section and choose Rotate Indefinitely (Figure 15.5).
Figure 15.5  Choose Rotate Indefinitely in your Campaign settings.

■  A d Copy T h em e s to Spa r k You r Cr e at i v i t y
527
Please note that since this is a Campaign setting, it will affect all the ad groups 
within that campaign. The next step of the testing process is entering the new ads in 
the test ad group.
Create the Test Ads
Navigate to the ad group where you would like to test your ads and enter them in the 
Ads tab of the ad group (Figure 15.6).
Figure 15.6  Multiple ads running in one ad group
If you are testing ads across many ad groups at once, you may want to use the 
AdWords Editor import function to add the new ads to your account or use the copy 
and edit function within the interface.
Now be patient as the ads run for a while so you can accumulate the necessary 
data to determine which of the test ads leads to the best results for your company.
General Guidelines for Statistical Significance
When testing, the most important concern is that you believe in the data before you 
make a decision. If a single person converting versus not converting makes a large dif-
ference in your conversion rate, you do not yet have statistical significance.
For example, if 100 people click on your ad and one converts, you have a 1 
percent conversion rate. If the very next person, click 101, leads to a conversion, your 
conversion rate almost doubles. If your conversion rate doubles and you are using 
ROAS-based bidding rules, your bid doubles as well. However, in this case, you do not 
have statistical significance.
There are two ways that Excel will help you calculate when you have enough 
data. You can use either chi-square distribution or analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
Using either of these two methods will give you very accurate data of when you can 
end a test and make decisions on the data. However, both methods take some work 
to understand and implement in Excel. If you want to learn about these methods, 
Microsoft has online tutorials about using these two mathematical functions.
For our purposes, I’ll lay out some basic rules for how much data you need 
before you can end a test and measure the results.

528
There Is No “Best” Ad
There is only a best ad as it relates to your marketing goals. If you are trying to bring more visitors 
to your website or raise your quality score, you will focus on click-through rate. If you are bidding to 
maximize your profits, you will examine how much profit you receive from each visitor. Testing ads 
without a goal in mind will leave you staring at a spreadsheet of data without any meaning.
How Long Should the Tests Run?
Search behavior is different on weekdays than on weekends and can even change over 
the course of a month. In these cases, you want to make sure that you capture search 
data over the life span of the entire buying funnel.
If your sales cycle is short, or searchers come to your site and either buy or do 
not return again, you should run a test for at least a week. This captures the differences 
between weekday and weekend buyers. If your sales cycle is longer or you want more 
data (which is always useful), let the test run for at least a month.
If you have a good idea of your sales cycle length, run the test over the course of 
three sales cycles. If you sell used books, a week is long enough; however, waiting for a 
month is never a bad idea if you are manually crunching all of the numbers. Never use 
December’s data or holiday peaks for your testing. The traffic that you receive during 
holidays generally converts much higher than the rest of the year. Feel free to use holi-
day traffic to test holiday ads that are enabled only during those peak times.
Even if you decide to use ANOVA or chi-square for your analysis, using these 
general guidelines for making sure you capture searchers over the course of your entire 
sales cycle is a good idea. Neither of those systems will tell you that search behavior 
changes at different time periods. They will only examine the differences in the traffic 
and conversion numbers.
How Much Traffic Should Your Ads Receive?
The minimum amount of traffic each ad should receive is 300 clicks. That ensures that 
one person clicking versus not clicking will not change your CTR by a large amount.
I prefer 500 to 1,000 clicks for each ad before making decisions based on con-
version rates. This is where ANOVA and chi-square analysis can help significantly. If 
after the course of a month one ad has 200 clicks and one has 500 clicks and they both 
have similar impressions, you can make some assumptions about CTR, though you 
might not have enough data to make assumptions about conversion rate. In cases like 
this, utilizing higher-level Excel functions will let you know that you have enough data 
to end a test.

■  A d Copy T h em e s to Spa r k You r Cr e at i v i t y
529
If these numbers seem too high for you—which is often the case with accounts 
that receive only 1,000 clicks a month and any one ad group might not receive more 
than 100 clicks—there is another way to test ad copy, the multi-ad group approach, 
which will be discussed later in this chapter.
How Many Conversions Should You Have?
If you are testing for conversion rate, ROAS, or profit metrics, you need conversions to 
tell you which ad is leading to those higher metrics. A good guideline is a minimum of 
7 conversions per ad copy. A higher number, around 15, is better. If in doubt, let the 
test run longer.
AdAlysis: Automatic Ad Testing
Determining exactly where you have statistical winners can be highly time consuming and lead to 
frustration when you run the numbers and find out that after all the time in crunching the data, you 
only have winners in 40 out of 2,000 ad groups. I recently launched a software that will do all of the 
calculations for you. It also supports testing by device types, unique ad testing, and multi-ad group 
testing so that you can only work with the winners and ignore all the ad groups that have not reached 
statistical significance. You can learn more about this software at AdAlysis.com.
Meeting All the Requirements
Each test should meet a minimum number of days being run, clicks per ad, and conver-
sions per ad. If you have enough data according to ANOVA or your chi-square analy-
sis, but the test has run for only a single day, let the test run for a longer time frame. 
Each of the variables can affect your metrics, so you want to make sure that your ads 
run under all of the conditions possible.
Finally, you want to separate these metrics by search and display. Do not com-
bine the data from the two different distribution methods. If on the search network 
you have accumulated enough data to finish running a test, you can complete the test 
for search, but your display test must run longer.
Once your tests have met all the conditions I have described, it is time to run an 
ad performance report to examine the test results.
Measuring the Results of Your Ad Test
The ad performance report is one of many reports available in AdWords. This report 
shows you all your ad copy and associated metrics. For ease of showing metrics, let’s 
assume that you are using the AdWords conversion tracker (discussed in Chapter 13, 
“Devising Profitable Bid Strategies ”) to show conversion information in your reports.

Chapter 15:  I m plem en t i ng T e st i ng T ech n iqu e s T h at W i ll I ncr e ase Prof i ts  ■
530
When you create the report, there are two important steps. First, choose the 
appropriate columns. Open the Customize Columns settings (Figure 15.7) and choose 
these inputs:

You Can Test Any Ad Type
In the Customize Columns data for the Ads tab, you can choose to view the type of ad such as text, 
image, mobile, or display ads so that you can segment your data to just view image ads or video ads. 
The principles for testing ads are the same. If you want to test image ads across the Display Network, 
create two to five images in an ad group. Wait for the images to collect enough data so you can make 
a decision. Then, run the exact same ad performance report as discussed earlier and decide which ad 
to keep based on your website’s goals.
You may find that certain images do better or worse on various types of sites. When examining the 
reports, if you see patterns that suggest certain types of images or videos are doing better on one site 
than another, you may want to create placement targeted ad groups using your best images for that 
particular website.
If you are testing multiple conversion actions, you may want to choose addi-
tional conversion columns or segment the data by conversion action or type. Once you 
run the report, you will have a large Excel file that you can manipulate to view the 
data, which will help you make a decision.
Finally, when you choose to download the data you can also segment the infor-
mation. Segment the data by network so that you can see the difference between search 
and display. Never mix these two distribution methods together.
For ease of illustration, Figure 15.8 shows an Excel report with only a few data 
points selected.
Figure 15.8  Ad performance report
Once you have this report, you need to make a decision about which is the best 
ad for your account:
••
If you are looking to maximize customers, Ad Copy 6 with the highest conver-
sion rate is your best ad.
••
If you are looking to lower lead costs, Ad Copy 3 with the lowest cost per con-
version is your best ad.
••
If you are looking to get the most visitors to your website or to increase your 
Quality Score, Ad Copy 5 with the highest CTR is your best ad.

Chapter 15:  I m plem en t i ng T e st i ng T ech n iqu e s T h at W i ll I ncr e ase Prof i ts  ■
532
The first step is to save the ad that did the best for your company. Before you 
delete the losing ads, examine them to see what you can learn.
For instance, if your goal is to have the lowest cost per conversion, which is Ad 
Copy 3, but you want to increase total visitors to your website, your next goal is to 
increase CTR for a similar ad. Ad Copy 5 is by far the highest CTR of all the ads that 
were tested. Therefore, see if there are elements that you can combine from Ad Copy 3 
and Ad Copy 5 to write some new test ads in the ad group and continue testing.
At this point, you could use the methodological approach. If you want to go 
this route, mix and match the elements of each ad. For instance, if you want to use the 
existing elements from Ad Copy 3 and 5, you can start to create new ads with these 
elements:
New Ad Copy 1
••
Ad Copy 3 headline
••
Ad Copy 5 description line 1
••
Ad Copy 5 description line 2
New Ad Copy 2
••
Ad Copy 5 headline
••
Ad Copy 3 description line 1
••
Ad Copy 5 description line 2
Keep repeating the process until you have created the new combinations. Then 
when you run an ad performance report, not only will you be examining each ad indi-
vidually, but you can also break down the metrics of each copy element within that ad. 
For instance, you would examine the CTR of Ad Copy 3’s headline against the CTR 
of Ad Copy 5’s headline. By looking at the metrics for the headline, description line 
1, description line 2, and the display URL individually, you will discern patterns that 
show which elements lead to higher conversion rates and higher CTRs.
Do not feel you need to use the methodical approach all the time, because it 
does take significantly more traffic than a unique ad approach before each ad will have 
enough data for you to choose a winner. In the earlier case, you could keep the win-
ner, write a couple of new ads using variants from the two pieces of ad copy, and then 
test those new ads. In addition, if you do not have enough data, or your account is very 
large, you can use the multi-ad group testing approach.
Multi-Ad Group Testing
Multi-ad group testing is a good testing method to use when you do not have enough 
data to regularly test due to a lack of clicks and impressions or if your account is so 
large that you can never write ads for all your ad groups and you are forced to create 
ads through formulas.

■  A d Copy T h em e s to Spa r k You r Cr e at i v i t y
533
With this method you first need to determine what you want to learn about your 
ads. For instance, you might want to know how two different calls to action perform 
or you may wish to know if including a geography in an ad does better than ads that 
do not include geographies.
Next, you will create your ads using the methods detailed in Chapter 12, 
“Saving Time and Scaling Accounts with the AdWords Editor,” in the section “Easily 
Creating Thousands of Ads.” If you want an even faster way of creating thousands of 
ads, take a look at the Mass Ad Creator software from Certified Knowledge at http://
certifiedknowledge.org/membership-information/ppc-tools/mass-ad-copy-creator-tool/, 
which makes it easy to create thousands of customized ads.
By using these methods to create ads, you can ensure that the lines you are creat-
ing to test across these various ad groups are identical, which is important for the final 
analysis. Once you have these ads running in your account and collecting metrics, you 
will run the ad report to download all of your data in Excel.
In Excel, create a pivot table where you are examining your metrics by an indi-
vidual ad line (Figure 15.9).
Figure 15.9  Ad data in a pivot table
In the pivot table, do not do an average of derived metrics, such as CTR and 
CPA, to analyze because those averages can be highly misleading; instead, sum the 
data by the individual metrics, such as cost, clicks, and conversions, and then used cal-
culated fields to determine the CTR and CPA. The reasons for this are listed in Chapter 
7, “Demystifying Quality Score” in the section “Diagnosing Your Quality Scores,” 
along with other useful pivot table information to help create this analysis data.
In this case, you can see that the line that corresponds to D2 Test 3 is our lowest 
CPA, highest CTR, and highest converting ad. Therefore, we would want to keep the 
ads that utilize this line, pause or delete the other ads, and continue testing.
If you are using this type of testing technique in long-tail ad groups, then finding 
exceptions to the rule where that line might not be the winner across every ad group 
is generally not worth your time. However, if you are testing these types of ads in a 
highly valuable ad group, then it can be useful to also do an analysis of your top ad 
groups to see which ones are below average and then test different ads or messages in 
those ad groups (Figure 15.10).

Figure 15.10  Ad group data
In an AdWords report, the Grand Total is the total of all the data you down-
loaded, which means that it is also the average CTR and conversion rates for all your 
data. Therefore, if you sort by highest to lowest on any metric, any data that is below 
the Grand Total is below the account average.
Multi-ad group testing does not have to be done strictly off an ad line; it can be 
done off any key in the account that you can designate as the base information for your 
pivot table or even as a filter.
For instance, the labels feature can be very useful within AdWords. If you label 
your ads based on the type of tests you are conducting, then you can run your pivot 
table metrics based on the labels and not the ad lines. If you are testing multiple con-
version actions across the account, you can label the ads based on their conversion 
action and then filter the data based on the ads containing that label.
When you combine pivot tables with labels, multi-ad group testing can become a 
very powerful way to test, especially in enterprise-size accounts.
Testing Mobile Ads
In AdWords, you can designate an ad as either an all-device ad or a mobile-preferred 
ad. If you have an ad group that contains only mobile-preferred ads, then that ad is 
actually being displayed on all devices. It is only through having at least two mobile 
and two desktop ads in an ad group that you can test appropriately for each device.
To find out how many ad types you have per ad group, and if you have ad 
groups that are not testing ads appropriately, you can once again use pivot tables to 
determine this information.

■  T e st i ng L a n di ng Page s to I ncr e ase Con v ersions

If you download your ad report while including the Device Preference column, 
you can put the information in a pivot table and then examine what ad groups do not 
have any ads in them for each device type (Figure 15.11).
Figure 15.11  Device preference ads by ad group
In this case, I also added conditional formatting to the table to highlight any 
rows that were less than 1, meaning that ad group did not have a single ad of that 
device preference in it. If I wanted to know where I was not testing appropriately, then 
I could have run conditional formatting to see where I did not have at least two ads of 
each type in the ad group.
Please make note of ad group 3. This ad group has two mobile-preferred ads in 
it but zero all-device ads. This means that the mobile ads are also showing on desktops 
and tablets.
It is very common to see different response rates for the same message on vari-
ous devices, so when you do your ad testing, examine the metrics by device and do not 
combine data for mobile and desktops.
By using these testing methodologies, you can continuously test new ads to see 
which ones are helping you reach your marketing goals for small to enterprise accounts 
and by both mobile and desktop devices.
Along with testing ads, you should also test landing pages. The ad transfers 
a visitor from a search page to your website and sets the expectations for what the 
searcher will find post-click. Once the ad has completed its job, the landing page must 
continue to move the visitor through your website so that you receive conversions. The 
first step in landing page testing is deciding where to send the traffic.
Testing Landing Pages to Increase Conversions
There are two aspects to landing page testing. The first is determining where you 
should send the traffic on your website. Once you have determined the best type of 
page to send your traffic, you need to test various layouts of the landing pages.

Testing Where to Send Traffic
In Chapter 5, “Creating Landing Pages That Convert Searchers into Buyers,” I dis-
cussed where you should send traffic on your website. The conventional wisdom says 
traffic should be sent to
••
The farthest logical point in the buying cycle
••
A page dedicated to the search query
Although conventional wisdom is typically correct, there are definitely times 
when it is wrong. You should test your own traffic to make sure that you are sending 
the traffic to the correct pages before performing the more difficult work of testing dif-
ferent layouts on your website.
Let’s examine some common queries to see where you should test sending traffic.
Informational Queries
Informational queries make up the majority of search queries on the Web. In Chapter 
5, I illustrated the point that you must answer the searcher’s question before attempting 
to monetize the query. In that example, you looked at the search query candle burning 
times and how that should not be sent to a shopping cart but instead to a comparison 
page that shows all the candles and how long each burns.
However, each time you add a click to the final conversion process your conver-
sion rates will decrease. Therefore, it is worthwhile testing what leads to higher profits: 
attempting to monetize an informational query or answering the searcher’s question 
with a comparison chart.
This is especially true for lead-generation websites. If your goal is to gather a 
lead so you can call someone back with their information, it can be more profitable to 
send someone to the lead-generation form or shopping-cart page, instead of the com-
parison page.
Ambiguous Queries
The search query merchant accounts is both an informational and ambiguous search 
query. You do not know if someone is looking to sign up for a merchant account or if 
they are looking for information on a merchant account.
Search queries such as merchant account, Chicago mortgage, or auto insurance 
often go to a landing page with a small amount of information and a form to be com-
pleted. This is not necessarily a bad search experience if someone knows enough to fin-
ish filling out the form.
A common search experience is that the searcher conducts a search for Chicago 
mortgage, sees the landing page, and then starts to fill out the form. Halfway through 
the form, there is a required field that asks, “What type of mortgage account do you 

■  T e st i ng L a n di ng Page s to I ncr e ase Con v ersions
537
want?” If the searcher does not know the difference between an ARM, fixed, reverse, 
or interest-only mortgage, they cannot finish filling out the form.
What happens next? The searcher returns to Google, searches for the different 
mortgage types, and finds a page that explains all the different mortgage options. If 
that page also has a form on it, they are more likely to finish filling out the form on the 
page that helped them understand the options than return to the initial form page.
To see which is more profitable for you, create a chart that explains the different 
mortgage types and the advantages and disadvantages of each and that has a section 
where there is a call to action to apply for each specific mortgage type.
Test a form landing page against a comparison chart to see which one leads to 
higher total profits. Additionally, you can test a combination page that has both the 
comparison chart and a form embedded into the page.
Local Business Queries
If the search query is Pittsburgh kitchen remodeling, conventional wisdom says to send 
the user to a page that shows before and after pictures of a kitchen. However, hiring a 
contractor is difficult. Everyone has heard horror stories about how they hired a con-
tractor to remodel their house and three months later the job is over budget and still 
not completed.
Use the In-Page Analytics tool from Google Analytics to examine your website. 
This tool will show you where someone is clicking on your website and conversion 
information based on the searcher visiting specific pages.
In the case of a contracting business, their “about us” page might showcase that 
they have been in business for 25 years, say that they belong to the Better Business 
Bureau, and contain customer testimonials. If they use the site overlay tool, they may 
realize that when someone sees their “about us” page, their conversion rates go up. 
Therefore they have two options:
••
Move some of the “about us” information to the kitchen remodeling page.
••
Send traffic to the kitchen remodeling page and the “about us” page and see 
which leads to more business.
Narrow Theme Sites
If you conduct a search for Washington DC nanny services, you expect to see a pic-
ture of the D.C. area, sample nanny résumés, and a form to sign up for access to their 
nanny résumés or schedule an appointment.
Hiring a nanny is a difficult decision. You are bringing a stranger into your 
house to care for your most prized possessions, your children. The question going 
through the searcher’s mind is not just “Should I trust this site?” but “Where do these 
nannies come from?”

Chapter 15:  I m plem en t i ng T e st i ng T ech n iqu e s T h at W i ll I ncr e ase Prof i ts  ■
538
In cases like this, you want to increase the visitor’s trust of your website. Using a 
segmentation page that shows a visitor two options might result in higher conversions. 
Option 1 is the “for families” link that goes into the family sign-up process. Option 2 
is for nannies to apply for a job. Option 2 also shows that the nanny must pass a back-
ground check and meet minimum qualifications before they will be accepted.
What a page like this does is demonstrate to the families that nannies must meet 
certain qualifications before they are accepted, which can increase the level of trust. 
However, what is interesting about this example is that if you test the first example of 
the Washington, D.C., sample résumés and a second segmentation page, you may see 
completely different conversion rates in search versus Display Networks for those two 
examples.
At this point, searchers are in the buying funnel, and therefore they have 
thought about hiring a nanny, background checks, and the issues of trust. But consum-
ers clicking display ads might not have thought about those items yet. Therefore, in this 
example the segmentation page may mean higher conversions for search whereas the 
résumé page may mean higher conversions for the content network.
Testing segmentation pages is useful if your products have multiple uses 
(Figure 15.12) or if different types of searchers use the same keywords.
In these cases, choose one product and send some traffic that way; often this will 
be the higher searched-for product or the higher margin product. Then send some traf-
fic to a segmentation page. Measure results over time to see which leads to higher total 
profits.

Product Category Queries
If someone searches for men’s Seiko watches, the searcher expects to see a page full of 
Seiko watches for men. However, too many options can be just as detrimental to con-
version rates as too few options. Most people can only hold five to seven items in short-
term memory. One item is why you conducted a search in the first place. A second item 
might be that you have a meeting you need to attend in 15 minutes. That leaves only 
three to five open slots left for processing.
If you have a category page of 20 watches, searchers can become overwhelmed 
and confused over what to do next. In cases like these, the searcher may feel there is 
too much to process and decide to come back later when they have more time.
Instead of sending someone to a category page, choose three to five of your top-
selling Seiko watches for men and feature them on a landing page. Many consumers 
will choose from these few items since they can easily process the differences between 
the designs and features of these watches. At the bottom of the page have a link such 
as “See all of our Seiko watches.” You will have customers who want to look at every 
single watch, and this option allows them to see everything while keeping the total 
options limited.
Then test this limited product page against your typical category page. Does 
limiting options increase your conversion rates?
Brand Searches
Many companies use their own name as a keyword and then send the traffic to their 
homepage. While this is an example of a navigational query, it can also be a waste of 
money. The company should rank number one organically for their company name, 
and consumers can find the company via multiple means.
However, if competitors are also buying your name, it is a good idea to buy it 
yourself so you do not lose out on traffic. But you may not want to send the traffic to 
the homepage of your website.
It is difficult to launch new products on the Web. There is often little search 
volume for brand-new products, and you need to build awareness with your consum-
ers that your new products exist. With branded terms, test by sending the traffic to a 
“what’s new” page (Figure 15.13).
Then choose another action on your website, such as a newsletter subscrip-
tion, and send some of the branded traffic in that direction. Measure whether creating 
awareness for your new products leads to more revenue than trying to increase your 
newsletter subscriber list.

Thank-You Pages
Many thank-you pages say, “Thank you for your purchase. We will process your order 
within 2–3 business days,” which says to the customer, “Thank you for giving us your 
money. We will get to your order when it is convenient for us.” Most thank-you pages 
do not continue to engage the customer. The thank-you pages essentially tell the cus-
tomer to close the browser because there is nothing left to do on your website.
If someone reached a thank-you page, they gave you a level of trust. Do not send 
these visitors away. Test different thank-you pages to see which one leads to a higher 
customer engagement.
Depending on your business model, there are different types of thank-you pages 
you can create. Here are some examples to get you started:
••
Learn more about our company by downloading this whitepaper.
••
Create an account to track your order.
••
Subscribe to our newsletter.
••
Suggested products.

••
Send a 10 percent off coupon to a friend.
••
Get 10 percent off your next purchase by referring a friend.
Once you have determined which page on your website is the best place to send traf-
fic for each keyword or ad group, the next step is to test the layout of the individual pages.
Landing Page Testing Factors
Landing page testing is both a science and an art form. There are entire books dedi-
cated to testing single pages that go into much more depth than I can allocate in a 
single section. I will examine the big factors you should test and items to be aware of 
while you are creating pages and marketing campaigns. This will get you started in the 
right direction for creating landing pages and tests to help you improve your profits.
Start with Dramatic Changes
Best Buy uses very different pages for their top-level categories (Figure 15.14) compared 
to their sublevel categories (Figure 15.15).
Figure 15.14  Best Buy category page

Chapter 15:  I m plem en t i ng T e st i ng T ech n iqu e s T h at W i ll I ncr e ase Prof i ts  ■
542
These pages are dramatically different. Best Buy rarely features products on 
their category pages and instead features buying guides and information. Some sites 
showcase products at both levels on their sites, but they often have very different lay-
outs. When these layouts are dramatically different, it is worth testing how each layout 
changes your overall conversion rates.
You want to start your testing with dramatic changes. If you cannot see the dif-
ference within a few seconds, neither can your visitors. Once you have a handle on the 
larger items that affect conversion rates, you can move to smaller changes.
Figure 15.15  Best Buy subcategory page
Should You Add Navigation?
The more choices you give someone, the more likely they are to become confused over 
what to do next. Navigation options are additional choices. That does not mean you 
should always restrict navigation. There are different types of shoppers. Some shop-
pers want to make quick decisions, and limited choice is good. Other shoppers want to 
research the details and see all the options; limited choice can isolate these shoppers.

■  T e st i ng L a n di ng Page s to I ncr e ase Con v ersions
543
In addition, one of the factors that makes a landing page relevant for Quality 
Score factors is navigation. Too little navigation can adversely affect whether your page 
is deemed relevant by Google.
There are often nice compromises you can use to engage both of these shoppers, 
as shown on the Certified Knowledge website (Figure 15.16).
Figure 15.16  Certified Knowledge landing page that restricts navigation
The main call to action above the fold is Take The AdWords Challenge. The sec-
ondary items on the page are benefits, testimonials, and a video tour for the research-
oriented audience. At the bottom of the page are secondary conversions, newsletter 
signup, consulting requests, and in-person training.
Amazon takes a different approach to navigation. When you are in their main 
site, there are more navigational options than most people can comprehend. As soon 
as you enter the shopping cart, your choices become limited (Figure 15.17). You can 
change your shipping address, use a different payment method, and update quantities. 
What you cannot do is leave the shopping cart unless you click the Back button.

Chapter 15:  I m plem en t i ng T e st i ng T ech n iqu e s T h at W i ll I ncr e ase Prof i ts  ■
544
Figure 15.17  Amazon limits shopping cart navigation.
You most likely have a product or service page you are sending traffic to now 
that includes navigation. Create a second page with limited navigation and clear calls 
to action. Then test to see which of those pages increases conversion rates.
Are You Using Faces?
We are drawn to human faces. When a face appears on a page, the first thing most 
searchers do is look at it. Next, they follow the eyes to see where they are looking. If 
the face on your page is looking away from your content, so will the searcher.
Make sure that any face you have on a page is looking toward the main items on 
your page you want the user to see. For some sites, this will be the service benefits. For 
others, it will be the Submit button or the Add To Cart button.
Create two pages, one where the eyes are looking into your product benefits and 
another where the eyes are looking toward your submit action. See which version raises 
your conversion rates the most.
English Speakers Read Left to Right
If there is not a face on the page, the next item that draws the consumer’s attention is 
an image. Once our eyes are drawn to an image, we then start reading left to right. If 
your images are on the far-right side of a page, there is nothing left for the consumer to 
read and they can become distracted.
In Figure 15.18, the page on the right will perform worse in most cases. Since 
the page on the left also places the image on the left, as someone views the image their 
eyes will naturally be drawn back into the content of the page.

545
Figure 15.18  Identical pages with the image flipped
If you were advertising to a country where the population reads right to left, the 
exact opposite information would be true. Ensure that your images are strategically 
placed so that consumers’ natural reading habit keeps bringing them back into your 
content.
Testing Video
Images and text allow you to show and describe a product. However, video allows you 
to demonstrate a product or show real-life examples. When using video, you must first 
consider the searcher’s environment to decide if you want the video to start playing or 
not. If someone is in a work cubicle and their computer starts to speak, they are likely 
to click the Back button very quickly. If someone is at home or in an enclosed office, 
they are less likely to click the Back button if their computer makes noise. There are 
four ways to test video:
••
Autoplay with sound on
••
Autoplay with sound off
••
No autoplay
••
No video
I work closely with Google to conduct the advanced sessions of the 
AdWords Seminars for Success program. The initial landing page did not use video 
(Figure 15.19).
These pages worked quite well for a couple of years. As video hosting and band-
width significantly increased, I decided to test three versions of the page. The original 
used no video (Figure 15.19), the second version only used video testimonials, and the 
third version used even more video testimonials (Figure 15.20) followed by other vid-
eos on the Web where I have been interviewed. Since most of the audience is in a busi-
ness environment, I decided not to autoplay any videos.

Table 15.1 shows a high-level set of metrics from the test pages. Since the page 
without videos was the initial baseline page, there is no reason to include those statis-
tics. Both versions of the page started with the same opening video, hence the same 
number of users who played a video.

What was fascinating is that once someone started playing the testimonial vid-
eos, they watched almost all of them. Rarely did someone stop watching the videos. Of 
course, if someone decided they were ready to buy and left the page to enter their credit 
card details before the videos finished playing, they would not have seen all of the vid-
eos in their entirety.
While this shows for my test that videos increased conversion rates, there are 
many more items to test, such as these:
••
Opening video testimonial being a female
••
Showcasing the seminar content in video before the testimonials
••
Starting with a short interview before moving to testimonials
Any testing you do should evolve from what you have learned. This test first 
showed me that using video testimonial increased our company’s conversion rates. 
The second thing it taught me was that consumers liked seeing who the speaker was 
by watching interviews. Much more can be learned by continuously evolving the 
video tests.
Making Ads and Landing Pages Work Together
Your landing page is only as good as the synergy it creates with your ad copy. If your 
ad is not compelling or does not set the proper expectations for the landing page, the 
perfect page may still produce disappointing results. This synergy should extend not 
just to text ads but to display ads as well.
Showcasing the Offer on the Landing Page
If your ad and landing page use different color layouts, themes, and calls to action, 
you can confuse visitors and they may think they have arrived at the wrong place.

E*TRADE created a nice banner ad (Figure 15.21) with a simple call to action to open 
an account in minutes.
Figure 15.21  E*TRADE banner ad
The ad itself is clean and easy to read. The effectiveness of this ad increased dra-
matically when the user clicked on the ad and then saw the majority of the ad as part 
of the landing page (Figure 15.22).
Figure 15.22  E*TRADE landing page
The color scheme of the ad and the landing page are the same. The numbers are 
the same. The benefit messages are the same. The user knows they have arrived  at the 
correct page and can easily continue the action from clicking on the ad to applying for 
a new account.
Ensure Relevance for Your Audience
The concepts of connecting ads and landing pages apply to all your marketing efforts, 
not just your AdWords ads. Your social, email, and other advertising outlets can take 
advantage of these same ideas.
Delivery.com delivers takeout food to your door so you do not have to leave the 
house. They came up with a fantastic marketing idea during the winter. Essentially, the 

■  T e st i ng L a n di ng Page s to I ncr e ase Con v ersions
549
offer is that the colder it is outside, the more bonus points you receive to your account 
(Figure 15.23) if you order from them.
Figure 15.23  Delivery.com email promotion
While the idea was good, there were two areas where they could have increased 
the effectiveness of this campaign. This email was sent to many people in the north-
eastern United States. There are large weather differences between Pittsburgh; 
Washington, D.C.; Boston; and New York. When you are deciding to stay in or go out, 
the weather outside your house is more important than the weather in a different city. 
However, the offer in the newsletter was based on the temperature of Central Park in 
New York City. If you lived in Boston, and it was cold in Boston but warm in New 
York, this promotion did not do you a lot of good.
Second, Delivery.com knows the ZIP code of everyone in their database, 
because they deliver to people’s doors. The link in the email to “browse restaurants in 
your area” goes to the homepage of Delivery.com. I hope by now you realize that the 
­home­page is rarely the best page to send traffic. In this case, they should have coded 
the links based on the ZIP code of the recipient so that when they visited Delivery.
com’s website they were directed to the restaurants that delivered to their address.
The overall idea for the marketing campaign was brilliant. The execution could 
have increased its effectiveness. Make sure you think through your campaigns as a con-
sumer so that you are delivering effective messages.

Echo Special Offers on the Landing Page
Too often a consumer will see an ad that contains the text “Use Discount Code 
EHCODE for 20% Off,” and then they will visit the site and not see the code. They 
will navigate to the page where they enter their credit card information and not see the 
code. If the consumer looks around the site at all, odds are they will forget the code. 
Next, the consumer returns to the search results page and tries to find the ad again. If 
they cannot find the ad, they will become frustrated and may not return to your site to 
complete the transaction.
If you use discount or special offer codes in either text or display ads, it is imper-
ative that the exact same discount code or special offer can be found on the landing 
page (Figure 15.24).
Figure 15.24  eHarmony’s special offer landing page
Testing special offers and discounts is useful. The use of discounts will often 
increase conversion rates. However, your final profit on each sale is also lower. 
Therefore, when testing discounts, you should be testing to see if the use of a special 
offer increases conversion rates enough that it is worth taking a lower profit on each 
sale or if the lower conversion rate without a discount generates more profit.
Convey the Proper Experience
If you sell used books at a $5 price point, a searcher does not want to spend 20 min-
utes attempting to find their next used book. The searcher wants a quick Add To Cart 

■  T e st i ng L a n di ng Page s to I ncr e ase Con v ersions
551
button and an even faster checkout experience and does not want to take time out of 
their day to deliberate over a $5 investment.
When a consumer goes into a physical store to buy a diamond, they are treated 
to gorgeous showcases, helpful sales staff, and the ability to touch and examine not 
only the diamonds but the rings and necklaces that enhance the diamonds.
If you sell diamond jewelry online, that same consumer does not want the same 
shopping experience as one buying a used book. The monetary investment is different, 
and the time between examining the products and buying a piece of jewelry is much 
longer. A shopper for expensive jewelry wants to be treated to an exquisite sales experi-
ence (Figure 15.25).
Figure 15.25  Theologos’s English homepage
The Theologos House of Jewelry website (www.theologos.gr/en.html) would not 
make for a good site to demonstrate how most e-commerce sites selling low-end prod-
ucts should be crafted. The site is mostly Flash, takes a long time to navigate, and is 
full of high-resolution images, yet you feel you are entering a website full of luxurious 
products.
While these are two extreme examples, when thinking of redesigning your web-
site or changing the sales experience, do not assume your marketing and design teams 
know best. Create a few design variations to see which one helps you reach your mar-
keting goals.
Ensuring Easy Information Retrieval, Not Perfection
Do not get caught up in creating landing pages that cost more to design than you can 
afford. You can spend thousands of dollars creating each landing page variation to test. 

Chapter 15:  I m plem en t i ng T e st i ng T ech n iqu e s T h at W i ll I ncr e ase Prof i ts  ■
552
For some companies, that price point fits into their marketing budget. For others, it 
does not. Your pages do not have to be perfect Flash pages that mimic the Theologos 
House of Jewelry site. Your landing pages need to quickly and easily convey the infor-
mation necessary for someone to get the answer to their question and make a conver-
sion decision (Figure 15.26).
Figure 15.26  Logically organized landing page for Royal Volkswagen
This landing page, created by R.H. Donnelley for Royal Volkswagen, is not an 
expensive Flash-driven landing page. It is a clean landing page that tells a consumer 
what the company does, shows their service area, and offers several conversion options. 
In the case of this site, the dark-colored navigation bar is actually a conversion bar. 
The consumer’s options are
••
Send To Friend
••
Send To Phone
••
Add To Address Book
••
Add To Bookmarks
••
Print 
You would not accuse this page of being an expensive-looking landing page or 
one that is hard to create. However, it is an effective page because it quickly conveys 
information to the consumer in a friendly, easy-to-digest manner.

Essential Items to Test First
When deciding which pages to test first, start with your landing pages that receive the 
most traffic. Even small gains in conversion rates for pages with high traffic will help 
increase your profits. The other pages you should start testing are ones that have the 
highest potential of profits. This might be a page of your top-selling products, your 
sales pages, or your high-margin products.
Once you have started testing the beginning part of the funnel, test the second 
step of the funnel. Do not start with the second or third steps. If someone does not 
make it from step 1 to step 2 of your funnel, it does not matter how good your second-
ary pages are.
The main items to start testing are
••
Headline
••
Hero shot (the picture on your page, either a person or a product image)
••
Page layout
••
Call to action
••
Custom benefit
••
Navigation
When thinking about your layout, additional items to test would be
••
Color scheme
••
Logo
••
Authority and trust icons
••
Product or service descriptions
Once you have decided what you are going to test, it is time to set up your test.
Creating a Landing Page Test
There are two ways to test landing pages: an A/B test and multivariate testing.
A/B Test  This is where you have two versions of a page and you send some traffic to page 
A and some traffic to page B. This method is good for testing websites with low traffic 
or testing where to send the traffic before testing different page layouts.
Multivariate Testing  This testing methodology allows you to test several variables at once. 
For instance, you may have two headlines, two hero shots, two customer benefits, 
and two calls to action. Testing two variations of four variables is 16 different tests. 
Multivariate testing requires a significant amount of traffic to receive significant results.
It is often best to start with some simple A/B testing to determine some of the 
large considerations such as layout, picture sizes, overall messaging, and customer 
benefits. Once you have a good idea of your layout, then you can move to multivariate 
testing.

Chapter 15:  I m plem en t i ng T e st i ng T ech n iqu e s T h at W i ll I ncr e ase Prof i ts  ■

For our purposes, I will illustrate setting up a straightforward A/B test in 
AdWords without going through the technical implementation of multivariate testing 
to show how easy it is to start testing your website. Testing is not difficult—the hard 
part is determining what to test.
Creating A/B Landing Page Tests in AdWords
The first step, just like with ad testing, is to make sure that you are using the Rotate 
Indefinitely ad delivery campaign setting. You want each test to receive equal exposure. 
Next, choose two or three pages where you want to send traffic.
Finally, navigate to the ad group where you want to set up the test. Duplicate 
your existing ad a second or third time, depending on how many different pages you 
want to test. Then change the destination URLs of the new ads to send traffic to the 
new pages you want to test.
Just as with ad testing, wait until you have enough data to obtain statistical sig-
nificance by using chi-square or ANOVA in Excel or the guidelines from the ad copy 
testing section earlier, “General Guidelines for Statistical Significance.”
Make Sure Your Duplicate Pages Are Not Crawled
If you use the same content on multiple pages within your site, you can cause issues for your organic 
rankings. Because Google will find two variations of the same content, they will choose which page 
to rank on your website. The focus of PPC landing pages should be conversions. If you also do SEO, you 
often need to change page elements based on search engine ranking factors that might not increase 
conversion rates. Therefore, you might have two sets of similar pages on your website: one set for PPC 
and the other for SEO. If this happens on your website, use your robots.txt file to block your testing 
pages from being crawled by the organic spiders.
Once you have enough data, you can either run an ad report as mentioned under 
the ad-testing section, “Measuring the Results of Your Ad Test,” or run a Destination 
URL performance report (Figure 15.27), which is found under the Dimensions tab, 
using at a minimum these data points:

Conv. Rate (1-per-click)
••

••

••
Total Conv. Value
Figure 15.27  Creating the Destination URL performance report
If you have multiple conversion types, choose the various conversion actions for 
which you want to see performance data to determine how well the page converted.
Examine the landing page metrics and compare those metrics to the goals you 
are trying to reach. There is no best landing page. If you want the most conversions, 
the highest conversion rate is your best page. If you are looking for minimizing lead 
cost, examine your lowest cost per conversion.
It is essential when running either ad copy or landing pages tests that you do not 
combine search and display data. Figure 15.28 shows the results from a narrow theme 
site test.
If you were to combine all data regardless of whether the metrics came from 
search or display, it would appear that the PPC dedicated page would be the best page, 
because its ROI, value per click, cost per conversion, and conversion rate are all better 
numbers than the homepage numbers.

Figure 15.28  Narrow theme landing page test data
When someone is engaged in search, they have thought about the products or 
services associated with their search. They are somewhere within the buying funnel. In 
this case, you see that the homepage led to a higher conversion rate than the PPC dedi-
cated landing page.
The PPC dedicated landing page was a page that showcased a specific offer 
to the user. It had fewer navigation elements than the homepage and did not explain 
multiple sides of the business. It had one call to action and explained only half the busi-
ness. For the Display Network, the PPC dedicated landing page converted much better 
than the homepage, which converted better for search users.
Note:  I conducted an informal survey of PPC experts on this experiment. Almost all of them thought the PPC 
landing page would do better. This result is the reason you test. Conventional wisdom is not always correct. Ideas 
will get you started thinking about layouts that will increase conversions. However, the data will give you conclu-
sive results on which test result is best for your company.
Testing Profit per Click and Profit per Impression
Which combination leads to higher profits?
••
High CTR, many visitors, low conversion rate
••
Low CTR, few visitors, high conversion rate
When you start to combine several metrics, it can become overwhelming to 
determine which keyword, ad, and landing page combination leads to the highest prof-
its for your company.
A searcher’s query sets their expectations for the search results page. The ad 
on the search results page sets the expectation for the landing page. The landing page 
needs to be an extension of the ad and answer the searcher’s initial question. Therefore, 
all of these elements affect each other. There is a way to boil down these various met-
rics to a single number that will tell you which combination is the most profitable.
This leads to my absolute favorite testing metrics: profit per click or profit per 
impression.

■  T e st i ng Prof i t per Click a n d Prof i t per I m pr e ssion
557
Every time your ad is shown on a search, you have a chance of a conversion. You 
chose a keyword. Someone searched for that keyword. Your ad was shown on a search 
page. You have a chance of converting that visitor. Therefore, you should measure how 
much profit you make on a search result every single time your ad is shown, even when 
it does not receive the click. This is known as profit per impression.
On the Display Network, you do not know the intent of the user. Some people 
are reading the articles, or the ad is well below the fold. In these cases, you should 
measure profit per click. However, when you use placement targeting on the Display 
Network, since you are choosing specific sites on which you want your ad shown, you 
should measure profit per impression.
When you measure profit per click/impression, what you want to know is how 
ad and landing page combinations affect your total profits. Therefore, you will com-
bine a landing page and an ad test.
Ad 1
Landing Page 1
Landing Page 2
Landing Page 1
Landing Page 2

To set up this test, follow these simple steps (Figure 15.29):
	 1.	
Write two ads.
	 2.	
Choose two landing pages.
	 3.	
Send ad copy 1 to landing page 1.
	 4.	
Duplicate ad 1 and send it to landing page 2.
	 5.	
Write ad 2 and send it to landing page 1.
	 6.	
Duplicate ad 2 and send it to landing page 2.

Once the test is set up, let it accumulate the necessary data for you to make a deci-
sion. When you have enough data, run an ad performance report with the same data 
points as in the ad copy testing section earlier, “Measuring the Results of Your Ad Test.”
Export the report to a spreadsheet and add these three columns (Figure 15.30):
••
Profit = Revenue – Cost (or your own calculations of profit)
••
Profit per Impression = Profit × Impressions
••
Profit per Click = Profit × Clicks
Figure 15.30  Profit per Click/Impression spreadsheet
In Figure 15.30, you can see that Test 2 has the highest profit per impression. 
This test does not have the highest CTR, conversion rate, or lowest cost per conver-
sion. However, all the metrics combined lead to the most profitable user experience for 
either search or site targeting.
If you take this report to the extreme and look at total profit as if each combina-
tion received all the possible impressions (Figure 15.31), you can see how much profit 
each test combination would have received.
Figure 15.31  Extrapolated profit if each test received all available impressions
Test 2 would have led to $258,791 in profit, which is $13,773 higher than the 
next most profitable combination, Test 4. Using profit per impression numbers is one of 
the best ways to understand which testing combination leads to the highest profits.
Conversion per Impression
In some cases, you might not be able to dive all the way into profit numbers. In those cases, CPI—or 
conversion per impression—is the next best metric. CPI can easily be calculated by dividing the number of 
conversions you have by the number of impressions you received. The higher the CPI, the more conversions 
that ad, landing page, or ad and landing page combination receives every time it receives an impression.

■  A dWor ds Ca m pa ign Ex per i m en ts
559
You do not have to follow the exact steps of creating two landing pages and two 
ads to do profit per impression and click testing. Whenever you run a test and you do 
not know which test is best for you, just divide the total impressions for each test by 
the profit for each test and see which is higher. This could be two ads and one landing 
page, one ad copy and five landing pages, or other combinations.
The testing methodologies you have seen so far require you to add new ads to an 
ad group and split your traffic in half. If you have profitable ad groups right now, you 
are taking a lot of risk that the new combinations will lead to similar or higher profit 
margins than you already have. There are ways to lower your risk threshold when test-
ing new ads or landing pages.
AdWords Campaign Experiments
AdWords Campaign Experiments (ACE) allows you to test a subset of your traffic. 
This is a good way to test various settings such as bids, match types, ads, and landing 
pages—especially in high-traffic or high-profit ad groups.
The way ACE works is that you define how often you want the test versus the 
control to run (Figure 15.32) in the Campaign settings. You can optionally set start 
and end dates.
Figure 15.32  AdWords Experiment settings
Once you save the experiment, it will not be active until you launch it. You 
need to navigate through the campaign and choose what should be Control Only or 
Experiment Only.

Chapter 15:  I m plem en t i ng T e st i ng T ech n iqu e s T h at W i ll I ncr e ase Prof i ts  ■
560
By default, if something is paused, it will remain paused. All other enabled items 
will be set to Control and Experiment. If you want something to always be displayed, 
make sure it is set to both Control and Experiment.
What happens is that for every auction, Google looks at your Control versus 
Experiment settings to decide which to use. In Figure 15.32 we chose Experiment 30 
percent of the time and Control 70 percent of the time. Therefore, at the beginning of 
an auction 70 percent of the time Google will treat only the items in our control data 
as being active; 30 percent of the time, Google will treat the items in our experiment as 
being active. When items are marked as Experiment and Control, they will always be 
considered active.
You can set Control, Experiment, or Control and Experiment settings by keyword, 
ad, or ad groups. Next to each data point, you will see additional options (Figure 15.33).
Figure 15.33  Choosing the Control And  
Experiment settings
In this instance, the ad groups AdWords and Marketing will run all of the 
time since they are listed as Control And Experiment. The ad group Seminars will be 
treated as active in 70 percent of the auctions. The ad group PPC will only be treated 
as active in 30 percent of the auctions.
If you wanted to test ad copy, either you could create an ad group that only con-
tained your experimental ads or you could mark each ad you are testing as experimen-
tal. Either method would achieve the same results of mitigating risk and controlling 
how often your test data is displayed.
Once you have defined all of your tests, navigate back to the Experiment section 
in your Campaign settings (Figure 15.34) and launch the experiment.

The Low-Tech Approach to Lowering Test Risks
ACE is a great way to test if you want to test only a few items at a time. However, the weakness of ACE 
is that you can have only one experiment running at a time. Therefore, if you are testing ads in 10 ad 
groups, and you have enough data to end the test in 4 ad groups but not the other 6, you cannot just 
end those 4 tests. You have to end all of them or leave them all running.
The low-tech approach to mitigating risk is to first duplicate the existing ad several times. Wait for the 
ads to be approved by Google, and then add just one new test ad.
For instance, if you duplicate an existing ad three times and then have only one test ad, the estab-
lished ads will be served 75 percent of the time and the test ad 25 percent of the time (assuming you 
are using Rotate as your ad copy setting). This will create a scenario where you are putting only 25 
percent of your existing revenue at risk.
Test Ad Copy
Established Ad Copy
You can do the same risk mitigation for landing page testing. Duplicate the established ad several 
times and send all of those ads to your existing landing page where you know your profits. Then 
duplicate the ad one last time and send only the traffic from that single ad to the test page. If you only 
wanted to test 10 percent of the traffic, you would have nine ads going to your established landing 
page and only one ad going to the test page.
Now that you have collected enough data to make decisions, you can end the 
experiment and choose your winners, delete your losers, and create your next test.

Best Practices for Testing Techniques That Will Increase Profits
Testing ads and landing pages is essential to maximizing the potential of your 
AdWords account. The most important thing with testing is to just start doing it. It 
is not difficult to test. Search behavior changes over time. Your competition will be 
changing their ads, landing pages, and offers. If you do not test ads and landing pages, 
you will never realize the full potential of your AdWords account or website.
By following the instructions in this chapter, you will be able to create both ad 
and landing page tests that will increase your profits and show you which of your mar-
keting elements resonate best with your customers.
••
When testing, make sure your campaign is set to Rotate Indefinitely so all the 
ads receive equal exposure.
••
Start by writing different types of ads, such as question, review, and informa-
tional ads.
••
Always filter your reports to see search-only or display-only data.
••
Test ads separately for mobile versus desktop devices.
••
When you have statistical significance, run an ad performance report and exam-
ine the data. Keep the best ad in your ad group. Examine the data from the los-
ing ads to see if you can learn anything. Delete the losing ads, and then create 
new ads to continue the cycle of testing. On the Display Network, if you find 
that certain ads perform better only on specific sites, use those ads in conjunc-
tion with managed placements.
••
When testing landing pages, first test where on your site you should send the traffic.
••
Once you are certain where to send visitors on your website, create different lay-
outs for your landing pages and test which one performs better.
••
Use the Destination URL performance report to see which page is best. You may 
see different pages perform best for the Display Network or search network.
••
If you are testing multiple metrics at once or are focused on profits, use profit 
per impression/click testing.
••
If you have established ad groups, test a smaller percentage of your traffic to 
lessen the risk of losing profits.
When you first start testing, it is not uncommon to see dramatic results. This 
is often because it is the first time you may have thought about how searchers view 
and interact with your ads and landing pages. Over time, your improvements will be 
smaller, yet every improvement continues to increase your profits—so never stop testing.
In this chapter, you used the ad performance report and the URL performance 
report to examine data. AdWords offers many different reports. In the next chapter, 
you will delve deeper into the reports to learn what type of data can be extracted from 
AdWords and the best uses of that data.

AdWords Reports: 
Extracting Actionable 
Information
Your AdWords account will accumulate a vari-
ety of statistics that are available through the 
AdWords reporting interface. Creating a report 
consists of three steps: understanding what 
you need to know, extracting the data from 
AdWords, and analyzing the report. In this 
chapter, you will learn how to create a report 
and then take an in-depth look into each of the 
reports and learn how to use them to improve 
your account’s performance.

Choosing General AdWords Report Settings
Google allows you to extract a plethora of data about your AdWords account’s perfor-
mance. To download the data, you must take a few steps. You first need to customize 
the interface—a report will mimic the interface—choose your time frame, and then 
segment the data if necessary.
This section initially focuses on preparing the interface to include the data you 
want to examine and then looks at the most common reports in detail and discusses 
their best uses.
Customizing the Interface
The first choice you need to make is what type of data you want to see. For example, if 
you want to see campaign data, navigate to the Campaign tab, and if you want to see 
keyword data, navigate to the Keywords tab.
If you do not see a tab listed, click the arrow at the end of the tabs (Figure 16.1) 
to enable additional tabs to be displayed by default.
Figure 16.1  Viewing additional tabs
It may not be obvious where you’d find some reports, such as those for geo-
graphic or demographic data. These additional reports are mostly stored under the 
Dimensions tab (Figure 16.2).
Some tabs offer secondary reports, such as the search query data for keywords 
or the automatic and managed placement reports for the Display Network. You will 
learn how to download these secondary reports in the “Using Reports to Optimize 
Your Account” section later in this chapter.
Finally, you will also want to choose a time frame for the data being displayed. 
The time frame dictates the range of data you are seeing. If you see a set of data that 
does not make sense, it is often related to the date range.
For instance, in the ad data you can see the percentage of an ad served. If you 
create a new ad and the next week log into your account and see that the new ad has 
never been served, you might be wondering why (assuming the ad has not been disap-
proved by Google). If the date range you are examining includes only data from the 
previous month when the ad was not in the account, it has to have been served zero 
percent of the time because the ad was not live during that time frame.

Figure 16.2  Dimensions tab reports
To customize the time frame, click the Custom date range box (Figure 16.3) and 
choose your time frame.
Figure 16.3  Customizing your time frame
If you want to compare time frames, you can click the Compare button within 
the time frame options and choose a time frame in which to compare your data 
(Figure 16.4).

Figure 16.4  Comparing time frames option
When you use the time frame comparison option, some of the data columns will 
have the + symbol in them. When you click the + symbol, the column will expand and 
you can compare the data for the two time frames within the interface (Figure 16.5).
Figure 16.5  Comparing time frames data
Once you have chosen your time frame and navigated to the proper tab for the 
data you want to see, it is time to customize the data being displayed.

Customizing Columns
To customize the data, you will need to select the data columns required for your anal-
ysis. To start, click the Columns button and choose Customize Columns; the resulting 
screen is shown in Figure 16.6.
Figure 16.6  Customizing the columns
The column options will vary for each tab, but three sets of columns are avail-
able in most reports: Attributes, Performance, and Conversions. Here are the most 
common column selections you will see:
Attributes  This data can vary significantly based on the column; it usually includes cam-
paign and ad group data and data associated to just that specific tab. For instance, at 
the keyword level, you can see Quality Score. At the campaign level, you can see cam-
paign type and campaign subtype.
Performance  Basic data such as clicks, CTR, CPC, and cost.
Conversions  All the data based on conversion tracking.
Call Details  Phone call data if you are using any of the call options.
Competitive Metrics  High-level data based on both your and your competitors’ data.
Campaign Settings  Only shown in the Settings tab. This is an easy way to see all the set-
tings at once.
Google Analytics  This option shows only if you have connected your AdWords and 
Google Analytics accounts and if your login email has access to both sets of data.
Search Funnels  Allows you to see assisted click and impression data, which is useful when 
determining attribution management strategies.
Performance (Active View)  Additional reporting data for the Display Network.

Chapter 16:  A dWor ds R eports: Ex t r ac t i ng Ac t iona ble I n for m at ion  ■
568
Level Of Detail  This option is mostly found within dimension reports where you might 
want to segment by campaign or ad group and report specific data such as gender for 
demographic data, cities for geographic data, or match types for search term data.
In the interface, select the columns you want to see in the report and add them. 
As you add columns, you will also see a list of all the columns that will be displayed. 
You can drag and drop the columns to easily reorder them (Figure 16.7).
Figure 16.7  Selecting your data
If you have a set of columns you intend to use multiple times, you can save it. 
That way, when you click Customize Columns in the future, your selections will be 
available.
Finally, click Save and you will be presented with all the data you want to see. 
However, working with large data sets within the interface can be overwhelming. 
Often you will want to download the data to easily manipulate it within a spreadsheet 
program.
Downloading Your Data
The next step to extracting data from AdWords is to click the Download Report icon 
that is represented as a down arrow, as shown in Figure 16.8.
In the resulting Download And Schedule Report screen, you are presented with 
several more options. First, you can choose the report’s format, such as PDF, CSV, or 
XLM (there are many more options). If you are working in Microsoft Excel, choose 
Excel .csv or .xlxs.

■  Choosi ng Gen er a l A dWor ds R eport Set t i ngs
569
Figure 16.8  Clicking Download Report
Next, you can segment the data. If you segmented the data within the interface, 
that segment will be displayed by default. However, the interface will show only one seg-
ment at a time. When you download the data, you can segment the data multiple times.
For instance, if you are running a test with AdWords Campaign Experiments on 
mobile devices to see the difference in clicks versus calls, you will want to segment by 
device (mobile, tablet, desktop), click type (call, click, direction, sitelink, and so on), 
and experiment (ACE), as shown in Figure 16.9.
Figure 16.9  Segmenting the report data
Be careful to avoid oversegmenting the data. Every time you segment the data, 
you are adding more rows to the output file. If you add too much data, you could be 
overwhelmed by the number of rows and not know where to start. In cases like that, 
run the report again with less segmentation until you start to become comfortable 
looking at multiple segments at once.

570
If you are going to create the same report multiple times, be sure to name the 
report. When you run a report, it will also be displayed in the Reports screen as the 
name you used with the option Run Now or Create Similar.
Finally, in the Email And Schedule Report section, you can choose whom to 
notify when a report runs. You can also specify that you want to have the report auto-
matically created and choose a Frequency setting, as shown in Figure 16.10.
Figure 16.10  Email And Schedule Report options
When you create a report that you are going to use multiple times, it is useful to 
choose the Save This Report option (as shown in Figure 16.10) and name your report so 
you know the report’s purpose and can easily create the same report again. Once you 
have specified the options, create the report and soon you will have a download file to 
work from.
You can always visit the Reports And Uploads screen (Figure 16.11) to change your 
report names, notifications, or frequency and to run the same or a similar report again.

Next, we’ll look at all the major reports and see various uses of the data to opti-
mize your AdWords account.
Using Reports to Optimize Your Account
Now that you can download and extract data from AdWords, it is important to learn 
how to take advantage of the various reports so that you make the best use of your 
valuable time in analyzing your account.
Excel’s conditional formatting and color-coding can really help you visualize 
your data for easier analysis. In Chapter 13, “Devising Profitable Bid Strategies,” you 
can learn how to color-code your data so you can more quickly see what is making—
or losing—you money.
Google no longer names reports in the interface since a report is just a data 
download of the current interface (with additional segmentations possible). These 
report names are left over from when either Google or advertisers would name reports 
so that it would be easy to refer to certain report types based on the data you are 
extracting from AdWords. To make it easy to refer to various data extracts, it is useful 
to name the reports so you can easily refer to the type of data you are referencing.
Campaign Reports
Campaign reports allow you to see quick snapshots of all your campaigns at once. 
These reports are especially valuable when you have a large account and need quick 
access to high-level data.
However, since most of your day-to-day account management decisions will be 
made at the ad group, display targeting, and keyword levels, campaign reports should 
not be used for making bid decisions. The purpose of running a Campaign report is to 
view performance statistics that are shown only at the campaign level or to see an over-
view of all your data. You will find these statistics in the Invalid Clicks and Impression 
Share reports.
Invalid Clicks Report
Under Performance in the Customize Columns section are two selections: Invalid 
Clicks and Invalid Clicks Rate. These statistics show you how many clicks you received 
for which you were not charged, as well as the percentage of total clicks that were not 
charged.
Note:  If you are trying to reconcile your analytics data with AdWords, this is a useful report to examine. 
Analytics systems include all visitors who made it to your website regardless of whether you were charged for that 
click. AdWords automatically discounts certain clicks from costing you money or accruing statistics within your 
account.

Chapter 16:  A dWor ds R eports: Ex t r ac t i ng Ac t iona ble I n for m at ion  ■

Impression Share Report
Under Competitive Metrics in the Customize Columns section are the following data 
points: Search Impr. [Impression] Share, Search Exact Match IS, Search Lost (IS) Budget, 
and Search Lost IS (Rank), as shown in Figure 16.12. If you choose all of these options 
and run a report, you will create an Impression Share report.
Figure 16.12  Impression share selections
The Impression Share report will show you how often your ads are being shown 
and reasons why they are not being displayed:
Search Impression Share (IS)  The percentage of times your ad was shown when it was eli-
gible for the auction
Search Lost IS (Rank)  The percentage of times your ad was not shown because your ad’s 
position was below the number of ads displayed on a page
Search Lost IS (Budget)  The percentage of times your ad was not shown because your bud-
get was too low
Search Exact Match IS  Your impression share if all your keywords were set to exact match
If you want to see your impression share for display, instead of choosing the 
impression share metrics for search, choose the impression share metrics for display. 
For search, impression share is a great metric to use for understanding share of voice. 
Since the Display Network can vary significantly in impressions day over day, the 
impression share for display reports is not quite as useful as search, which is often 
more consistent than display.
If you ever wonder how much an account could spend if you increased the bud-
get, the Impression Share report is the place to look. This report is also a great place to 
determine what needs the most attention in an account: Quality Score or bids.

Ad rank is determined by bid, Quality Score, and ad rank extension informa-
tion. If you examine your account and find that most of your impressions are lost due 
to rank, that means one of those numbers needs to improve. If you put your Quality 
Scores in a pivot table (refer to Chapter 7, “Demystifying Quality Score,” for more 
information) and find that most of your Quality Scores are 7 or higher, you will need 
to increase bids or add extensions to receive more exposure. If most of your Quality 
Scores are below 7, you need to spend more time on improving your Quality Score.
If you are losing most of your impressions due to budget and you cannot 
increase your budget, then you are probably overbidding. If you have a $100 daily 
budget with $1 CPCs, that means you will receive roughly 100 clicks per day. If you 
were to decrease your CPC to $0.75, you could receive 133 clicks a day. Since ad posi-
tion has little effect on conversion rates, those additional clicks should result in addi-
tional conversions. Of course, there does come a point where you can lower your bid 
too much to be on page 1 and you will not receive any clicks. There is a balancing act 
between CPC, clicks, and budget to find the best spots for you.
Ad Group Performance Report
Sometimes seeing keyword-level information is data intensive and you might want to 
see a higher level of information. The Ad Group Performance report is a good place to 
start.
Setting Ad Group Bids
If you are setting ad group–level bids instead of keyword-level bids for the search net-
work, you can use the Ad Group Performance report to determine your max CPC cal-
culations and then use the AdWords Editor to import the new bids into AdWords. In 
addition, if you are using CPA bidding or flexible bidding methods, the ad group data 
is what you will use to set your bid strategy or CPAs since you cannot have different 
bid strategies or CPA bids at the keyword level.
Ad Performance Report
The Ad Performance report allows you to see metrics for each of your ads. If you are 
testing ads, this is the report you will want to use. When you run an Ad Performance 
report, look in the Attributes section of the Customize Columns section to select ad 
types so that you can see the difference between text, image, Wireless Application 
Protocol (WAP), and other ad formats.
Be sure to segment the data by network so that you examine only search data or 
display data. Do not combine the metrics for search and display.
If your ads are on mobile phones, then also segment your ads by device type so 
that you are examining your ad data for each device type.

Chapter 16:  A dWor ds R eports: Ex t r ac t i ng Ac t iona ble I n for m at ion  ■

If your account does not accrue enough clicks per month for you to be able to 
test individual ads at the ad group level, and instead you use a tagline in several ads 
across your account, follow these steps to create the report necessary for you to analyze 
the data:
	 1.	
Create an Ad Performance report that includes the following:
Headline
Description line 1
Description line 2
Display URL
Impression
Clicks
Average CPC
Cost
Conversions
Conversion rate
Cost per conversion
Device preference
	 2.	
Export the data to a spreadsheet.
	 3.	
Create a pivot table from the spreadsheet.
	 4.	
Choose your ad element (such as headline or description line 1) as your row 
element.
	 5.	
Add the metrics (impressions, clicks, and the like) as your values.
	 6.	
Add calculated fields or simple formulas to derive your CTR, CPA, CPI, or other 
data from your base metrics to find your best ad components.
Follow these steps to create a pivot table that shows all of the metrics associated 
with an ad element (see Figure 16.13), so you can make decisions about which element 
of the ad copy is working best for your account.
In addition, if you are using labels, you can filter the data based on a label type 
or other filters, such as mobile preferred ads.
Although making decisions based on combining the data from various ads into 
a single report is not nearly as useful as examining individual ad copy results within 
a single ad group, it is better than not testing at all. This is a very useful technique for 
testing when you have little data or so many ads that you can never individually test 
them all.

■  Usi ng R eports to Op t i m i ze You r Accou n t
575
Figure 16.13  Pivot table for an Ad Performance report
Using this method without manipulating the data is useful if your ads have 
fairly similar impression, clicks, and conversion data in the different ad groups where 
they appear. If you find that the ads have large differences in CTR or conversion rates 
in various ad groups, you should use a weighted average for the data before examin-
ing it in a pivot table. You can use the same method discussed in Chapter 7 to create 
weighted averages. Just substitute the data columns from this report.
The Ad Performance report allows you to see how ads are doing by keyword, 
placement, ad group, or campaign. If you have certain placements or keywords that are 
of very high value to you, you can segment each ad by placement or keyword to find 
which ad is best in each circumstance. If there are individual placements or keywords 
where you want to test ads on just a single site, you can create single keyword or place-
ment ad groups for ad testing purposes.
Find Underperforming Ads
Another use for the Ad Performance report is to identify underperforming ads. Run 
an Ad Performance report for only the search network. Each report will contain sum-
mary information where you can locate your account’s click-through rate, conversion 
rate, and cost per conversion. Then look to see which individual ads are below your 
account’s norm.
Before you assume that these ads are underperforming compared to your 
account, always examine the keywords that are causing these ads to show. You will 

Chapter 16:  A dWor ds R eports: Ex t r ac t i ng Ac t iona ble I n for m at ion  ■
576
find instances where an ad group had more general keywords than other ad groups, in 
which case it is normal to see the CTR and conversion rate lower than the account’s 
norm or that the ad group has a lower average position than the other ad groups and 
therefore the CTR should be below average.
If you look at the keywords within an ad group, and they are as specific as for 
other ad groups and the ads have lower conversion rates, either the ad needs to be 
tested or the landing page should be changed. Always look at the keyword or place-
ment, ad copy, and landing page together when determining performance.
Find All Disapproved Ads
On the Ads tab, you can filter the approval status of your ads. A useful filter is to just 
look at disapproved ads (Figure 16.14). Ads can be disapproved for a variety of reasons. 
When an ad is disapproved, then it is not running. If an ad group contains only disap-
proved ads, then you are currently not showing for those keywords. When you filter 
and then download the data, only the filtered data is included in the report.
Figure 16.14  Filtering ads by approval status
In addition, if you have had several ads disapproved, you can filter only for dis-
approved ads so you know which ad groups need new ads. 
Keyword Report
If you want to see keyword information, start by downloading data from the Keywords 
tab. You can use this data to analyze your account in the following ways:
Set Keyword Level Bids  If you set bids for each keyword based on its returns, run this report 
and include keyword, match type, cost per conversion, value per click, and total revenue 
stats. Next, use the formulas in Chapter 13 to determine your new CPCs. Finally, input 
this data into a spreadsheet and use the AdWords Editor to upload your new CPCs.
If you have a significant number of keywords where the bids would have to be $0.00 
based on your conversion metrics, you will have to either choose to delete those key-
words, set your own bids not based on conversion metrics, or move them to a Budget 
Optimizer campaign (see Chapter 13).

■  Usi ng R eports to Op t i m i ze You r Accou n t
577
Improving Your Quality Score  If your Quality Score is under 6 or 7, you should continue to 
optimize your score. Run and download a Keyword report, including the Ad Group, 
Keyword, Cost, and Quality Score columns. Then input the data into a pivot table and 
look for ad groups with low Quality Scores and high spends. This will help you find 
pockets of high-opportunity areas to increase your Quality Score. For full details on 
this procedure, see Chapter 7.
Determining What Keywords Are Not on Page 1  Some keywords may have limited impressions 
and low conversions because they are not on page 1. To quickly view what keywords 
are not on page 1, create a Keyword report with the Keyword, Match Type, First Page 
Bid, and Max CPC columns. Then use conditional formatting to highlight keywords 
where the max CPC is below the first-page bid. You may want to increase these CPCs 
so that the keywords receive enough impressions for you to make determinations about 
their effectiveness.
Top versus Other Data  It is common to see vastly different click-through rates when your 
ads are on the top versus the side or bottom of the page. You can segment the keyword 
data to show the difference between top versus other data. When you run this report, it 
is also useful to include the estimated first-page bid and the estimated top-page bid so 
you can see the difference in estimated CPCs.
Search Query Report
If you use broad or phrase match keywords, your ads will show for a variety of words 
that are not in your account. The Search Query report will show you what someone 
actually searched for that caused your ads to be displayed. If you use AdWords conver-
sion tracking, you can see the conversion rate and cost per conversion for all of these 
keyword variations.
To see this data, navigate to the Keywords tab, click Details, and then choose 
All under the Search Terms menu, as shown in Figure 16.15. This shows you all the 
search terms for all the keywords in your ad group. To isolate the data for a single key-
word, click the arrow; to get back to the keyword view, select the keywords you want 
to analyze and then view the details.
Figure 16.15  Viewing search query data

Chapter 16:  A dWor ds R eports: Ex t r ac t i ng Ac t iona ble I n for m at ion  ■
578
You should run this report regularly and look for two specific pieces of 
information:
Search Queries That Cost You Money but Do Not Convert  With broad and phrase match keywords, 
your ads will be shown on a variety of queries. Some of those variations will convert 
and others will not. If you are using close variant matches, then your exact match key-
words can show for plurals and other variants.
When you find variations that are spending money and not converting, you should 
determine whether the keyword that is triggering the search query is appropriate to 
that ad copy and landing page. If the keyword is not appropriate to that ad group but 
is appropriate to another one, then add the keyword as a negative in the first ad group 
and as a positive keyword in the more appropriate ad group. Later, run a Keyword 
report and either choose to keep that keyword in the more appropriate ad group or 
delete the keyword altogether once it accumulates more data. Because you still do not 
want this keyword shown in the first ad group, leave the negative keyword in place, 
or move the negative keyword to the campaign level so that none of the ad groups will 
show for that word.
If the search query is not appropriate to any ad group in your account, add it as a 
­campaign-level negative keyword in whatever campaigns it may be triggered in so that 
your ad will not be displayed for that search query again.
Search Queries That Convert but Are Not in the Ad Group  If you find there are search queries that 
are converting but are nowhere to be found in your ad group, add these variations as 
positive keywords so you can track their performance and set appropriate bids for each 
keyword.
The one downside to this report is that the Google Analytics columns are not 
displayed. For instance, if you had 50 clicks and no conversions, then it is difficult to 
know if the keyword is going to be good or bad over time. However, if you saw that the 
keyword had 50 clicks and a 100 percent bounce rate, that paints a very different pic-
ture than a keyword with 50 clicks, a 25 percent bounce rate, and an average of eight 
page views per visit. To see Google Analytics data with your search queries, you can 
navigate to the Matched Search Queries data within Google Analytics (Figure 16.16) to 
see this information.
Figure 16.16  Finding search query  
data in Google Analytics

■  Usi ng R eports to Op t i m i ze You r Accou n t
579
Whenever you are conducting positive or negative keyword research, start with 
the Search Query report. Viewing search queries can give you insight into your custom-
ers and trigger new ideas for keywords.
Display Network Reports
When you are working with the Display Network, you have several ways to extract 
data to determine how your automatic and managed placements are performing.
When you navigate to the Display Network tab, you can use the submenu to see 
how your keywords, placements, or other targeting types are performing (Figure 16.17).
Figure 16.17  Display Network tab data
To dig into the automatic or managed placement data, navigate to the 
Placements data, and then click the See Details link directly below the placement types 
(Figure 16.18).
Figure 16.18  Navigating to detailed placement data
Once you click See Details and click all, you will then see the data for the actual 
URLs for the automatic and managed placements, as shown in Figure 16.19.
From here you can download the URL list to see each URL where your ad is 
being displayed, customize the columns to see additional data, exclude the placement, 
or make it a managed placement. The most common way to use this data to ensure you 
are receiving high-quality traffic from your placements is to follow these two steps:
	 1.	
Make sure your ad is being displayed on the correct types of pages. Click the 
URLs and look at the pages where Google is placing your ads.
••
If the pages are correct, regardless of the performance metrics, your key-
words or other targeting methods are being displayed appropriately and you 
do not need to adjust your display targeting tactics.
••
If the pages where your ads are being shown are not correct, you need to 
adjust your targeting methods so that you receive better placement.

Chapter 16:  A dWor ds R eports: Ex t r ac t i ng Ac t iona ble I n for m at ion  ■
580
Figure 16.19  Automatic placement data
For more information on choosing your targeting methods, see Chapter 9, 
“Understanding the Display Network.”
	 2.	
Look at the placement data or download the report; then create a pivot table and 
key the metrics off the pages where your ads are being shown:
••
If you see pages or domains that are not meeting your goals, block them.
••
If you see pages and domains that are meeting your goals, add them to a 
placements campaign and block them in the discovery campaign if you are 
using discovery and placement display setup as discussed in Chapter 10, 
“Utilizing Advanced Display Network Techniques.”
Note:  When adding sites to a placements campaign, always check to see if there are subsections of a website 
available for placement; if there are, look to see how your ads have done on the various subsections.
If you are seeing too many websites in this report and do not know where to 
start, use the filtering options to view only websites that have sent you over a mini-
mum amount of traffic, such as 20 or more clicks. By removing sites with low traffic 
from the report, you can create a report that includes only websites that have enough 
data for you to make decisions about blocking the site or turning it into a managed 
placement.
In addition, you can see this data in Google Analytics and include additional 
metrics such as bounce rates and time on site to find placements that are sending 

■  Usi ng R eports to Op t i m i ze You r Accou n t
581
low-quality traffic and block them quickly, or sites that are sending high-quality traf-
fic that you want to be patient with before you decide to block them or add them as a 
managed placement.
After you examine the placement data, you will also want to study the managed 
placement information independently since with managed placements you are choos-
ing exactly where your ads are being displayed and you can manage them similarly to 
keywords, such as setting custom bids for each placement. Make sure the placement is 
performing, and use your typical bid formulas to set bids for each placement.
Dimensions Reports
Several reports are listed on the Dimensions tab. Some of them, such as Time, have 
multiple subsets of reports—you can see time data by day of the week, day, hour of 
day, month, and so forth. In addition, some reports that appear on other tabs are dupli-
cated here, such as the automatic placements and search terms. Therefore, this section 
will not examine every report on the Dimensions tab. Instead I will focus on the most 
common reports and ways of using that data.
Destination URL Report
The Destination URL report allows you to see metrics for every page you are sending 
traffic to within your AdWords account. If you are testing various landing pages, this 
report can show you which landing pages have the highest conversion rate.
Note that you will see metrics for every destination URL even if they are dif-
ferent only through tracking parameters, such as those found in Chapter 5, “Creating 
Landing Pages That Convert Searchers into Buyers.” For instance, while these three 
links are the same page on a website, the URL Performance report will show three dif-
ferent lines of data in your report:
Example.com?src=4
Example.com
Example.com?matchtype=exact&{keyword}
In this case, it is useful to strip off the tracking parameters and combine the data 
for each URL. Follow these steps to easily strip off the tracking links:
	 1.	
Copy the Dest URL column.
	 2.	
Paste it into a new sheet.
	 3.	
Highlight the column, and select the Text To Columns function on the Data tab.
	 4.	
Choose Delimited, and click Next.
	 5.	
Choose Other, and in the text box type a question mark.
	 6.	
Click Finish.
	 7.	
Copy that column and paste it into the original report.

Chapter 16:  A dWor ds R eports: Ex t r ac t i ng Ac t iona ble I n for m at ion  ■
582
Although this appears to be a complicated process, after you do it once or twice 
you will find it takes less than 10 seconds to accomplish. Since you will now have the 
same URL on different rows, it is time to combine the data across all the rows. The 
easiest way to do this is to create a pivot table. In your Row labels, show the destina-
tion URLs. In your Value column, choose the metrics you want to see, such as cost per 
conversion and conversion rate.
Note:  If on your website the URL example.com?123 is a different page than example.com?1234, you 
may need to use a different delimiter than the question mark in Excel’s Text Import Wizard.
Another good use of the Destination URL report is identifying underperforming 
landing pages. You can create an average for your account and then use the same steps 
as you did for the ad copy analysis earlier; just substitute the destination URL for the 
ad copy information.
Destination URL is also the report you will want to use for checking your site 
for broken links. Websites change over time, so it is common to see URLs get broken. 
If you are sending traffic to broken pages, you are just wasting money. Run this report 
and then either use a tool like Certified Knowledge’s Broken Link Checker or import 
the data into a crawler tool like Xenu and spider the URLs to see if any of your links 
are broken.
Viewing Conversion Rates by Time Frames
You can view your conversion rates by day of the week, day, week, month, quarter, 
year, or hour of the day. If you are doing analysis to determine whether you should use 
ad scheduling to change your bids on certain days or times of day, these reports are the 
best place to start that analysis.
If during your analysis you find that only a handful of ad groups change perfor-
mance by time of day, you might move those ad groups to a new campaign and leave 
the others in the original campaign.
Geographic Report
The Geographic report on the Dimensions tab allows you to see your metrics by coun-
try, region, metro, or city. You will want to segment the data by network so you can 
see search and display data separately.
Run this report and examine the differences in your clicks and conversions by 
geography. If you find there are certain geographies that are not converting, you may 
want to create a separate campaign to show different messages to those areas. If you 
find there are geographies that are converting at a much higher rate than normal, you 
may want to create a campaign with a higher daily budget to reach just those areas.

■  Usi ng R eports to Op t i m i ze You r Accou n t
583
You do not have to go to the extreme of creating new campaigns for each geog-
raphy. You can use bid modifiers to change your bid in each area. This is the best 
report to use when determining what areas you need to add to your geography target-
ing so you can use set geographic bid modifiers.
The Geographic report can also give you a point of investigation for your web-
site analysis. It is not uncommon for American companies to advertise in both the 
United States and Canada, only to find that their Canadian conversion rates are much 
lower. This is because many sites do not ship to Canada or accept non-U.S. billing 
addresses, yet these same companies still serve ads to Canada. By using this report to 
find areas where your conversions are lower than normal, you can identify other errors 
that have nothing to do with AdWords.
One of the Quality Score factors is click-through rate in a specific geography. If 
you find that your CTR is much lower in a geographic region, your Quality Score for 
just that region may also be lower. In this case, you might want to exclude that geog-
raphy or create a specific campaign with ad copy that speaks to that region to increase 
your CTR and visibility in that geography.
When you are trying to determine where people are clicking and buying, the 
Geographic report can give you insight into the performance of various geographies 
and help you decide whether you need to include, exclude, or change your geographic 
targeting options.
Reach and Frequency Report
The Reach and Frequency report is shown only for the Display Network. You can see 
the data by day, week, or month. Reach and frequency are two common metrics for 
media campaigns and display ads that determine how many people saw an ad and how 
often those people saw an ad.
If you are buying CPM, you are paying for impressions. Many CPM buys are 
on a set number of impressions. The lower your frequency cap, the less an individual 
person may see your message, but more total people will see your message for those 
impressions. Conversely, the more an individual person sees your message, the fewer 
total people will see your message.
There is a balance to be found in reinforcing your message with CPM or CPC 
display ads to an individual person by having them see your ad multiple times com-
pared to the total number of people you want to see your ad.
When running remarketing campaigns, take a look at your frequency numbers 
to make sure you are not serving your ads too often to the same people. Remarketing 
can be a fantastic source for conversions. It can also be an easy way to annoy your cus-
tomers if you show your ads too often to them.
There is no magic number for frequency capping. Some websites are full of dis-
tractions, and any one ad might not be noticed; in that case you would want a higher 

Chapter 16:  A dWor ds R eports: Ex t r ac t i ng Ac t iona ble I n for m at ion  ■
584
frequency. Some ads are prominent, such as interstitials or large banners on a mostly 
text-based page, and therefore the frequency number can be lower.
Note:  I recommend that you set a frequency cap on your ads, even if it is as high as 7 to 10 per user per day. 
That will help distribute your ad to more individuals. For CPM ads, you will often set lower frequency caps than with 
remarketing or general display ads.
If you find that your frequency is higher than you desire, you can set or adjust 
the frequency cap in your Campaign settings.
Paid and Organic
If you have a Google Webmaster Tools account, you can connect it to AdWords in the 
My Account > Linked Accounts options.
Once you connect these two accounts, you can then see organic, paid, and com-
bined statistics to see how your ads and organic listings affect each other. If your com-
pany is trying to improve their SEO efforts, this is one of the best reports they can use 
to see how their efforts are working (Figure 16.20).
Figure 16.20  Paid and Organic report
Even More Reports
There are more reports to be found in AdWords, and the same data analysis applies 
to these additional reports. For instance, use your display bidding metrics for 
Remarketing, Interest, and Topic reports. Use your keyword bidding methods for prod-
uct listing ads.
Between choosing the type of data you want to see, customizing the columns, 
and segmenting the data, there are thousands of possible combinations of reports that 
you can create.
You should first determine what data you need to make sound decisions and cre-
ate actionable items. Then, you should create the reports that will help you extract that 
data so you can analyze it and make changes that will further enhance your account’s 
performance.

Creating Custom Alerts
In AdWords you can create alerts to let you know when something has changed in your 
account. This is a useful way of getting notifications of changes so you do not have to 
constantly monitor your account.
You can create an alert in the Campaign, Ad Groups, Ads, and Keywords tabs. 
To create an alert, navigate to the appropriate tab, click the Automate button, and 
choose any option that ends with Send Email When, as shown in Figure 16.21.
Figure 16.21  Creating an alert
The options you see will vary depending on the tab you choose. For instance, 
you can receive an alert if your impression share has dropped below 80 percent for any 
select number of campaigns (Figure 16.22). However, Impression Share is a campaign 
or ad group setting, so this alert is not available on the Ads tab.
Figure 16.22  Custom impression share alert

Chapter 16:  A dWor ds R eports: Ex t r ac t i ng Ac t iona ble I n for m at ion  ■
586
You can create alerts for many different scenarios; however, receiving a plethora 
of emails might not be useful. It is best to identify what matters most to you and then 
create an alert.
For instance, here are some common custom alerts:
••
Conversions increased more than 20 percent. In this case you might want to 
increase your budget to capture these additional conversions.
••
Conversion rate decreased more than 20 percent. In this case, you might want to 
pause your ads and investigate.
••
Cost has increased or decreased more than a certain amount. There is more or 
less interest in your ads and keywords, and you might want to double-check 
your budgets.
••
The number of impressions has increased or decreased more than a specific num-
ber. Similar to your budgets, what is causing the change in impressions?
••
Average CPC has increased more than a certain amount. In this case, it is likely 
that either your Quality Scores have dropped or your competition has increased 
their bids.
If you are a brand manager, you can create an alert for when your brand terms 
suddenly spike or drop. To do this, put all of your brand terms either in the same cam-
paign or a set of ad groups, and then create alerts for that campaign or ad group. Once 
you have created alerts, you can manage all them in the Automated Rules section, 
shown in Figure 16.23.
Figure 16.23  Managing automated rules
If there are certain metrics that you regularly log into your account to check on, 
that is the perfect opportunity to use an alert and save yourself time.

Best Practices for Using AdWords Reports
Being able to extract actionable data from your account is essential to ongoing optimi-
zation. First determine the data you need, and then examine the available reports.
By following the practices in this chapter, you should be able to create reports 
that give you the data necessary to make optimization decisions for your AdWords 
account.
••
When you find custom reports that help you make decisions, save those reports 
as templates so you can easily re-create the same report.
••
Schedule your favorite reports to be automatically created and a notification 
email sent to you.
••
Always segment the data so you are viewing only search data or display data. 
Never combine the two networks in your analysis.
••
Always segment your data by device type so you can make decisions for desk-
tops and tablets separately from mobile devices.
••
When running short on time, run an ad group report to find ad groups that are 
not meeting your goals. Then examine the keywords in just that ad group to deter-
mine new bid prices or move keywords into new ad groups with new ad copy.
••
The URL report will show you weaknesses in your landing page performance. 
Use this report to determine where you should be sending traffic and to check 
your account for broken links.
••
When you want to expand your keyword list or add negative keywords, start by 
analyzing the Search Query report.
••
If you have more data than you can analyze, try less segmentation of the data.
••
If you need specific information that is not available, determine if there is 
another way to structure your account so you can retrieve that data. For exam-
ple, if you want to see conversion rates by hour for a particular keyword, create 
an ad group with only that keyword. Now the hour-of-day conversion report 
will show you conversion rates by hour for that particular keyword since it is the 
only keyword in that ad group.

If there are certain metrics that are very important to you, create an alert to be 
notified when those metrics have changed.
You should regularly extract and analyze AdWords data so that you understand 
how your account is performing and what optimization steps you need to take to 
increase your account’s effectiveness.
However, with so many options available in AdWords, it can be difficult to pri-
oritize how often you should run reports and make decisions. In the final chapter, I will 
discuss the best places to spend your time so that you can continuously increase the 
success of your AdWords account.

Step by Step: Creating 
and Monitoring Your 
AdWords Account
In the previous 16 chapters, we examined best 
practices, research, and optimization techniques. 
AdWords gives you a dizzying array of pos-
sibilities. In this chapter, I simplify the process 
of starting and managing AdWords by showing 
you how to create and optimize your account 
step by step.
Much of the information in this chapter is 
contained in other chapters. This chapter con-
solidates the information into a single place so 
that you can refer to it as you are optimizing 
your accounts.

Before You Create Your Account
It is easy with AdWords to start choosing keywords and writing ad copy, but if you 
do not start by thinking through all the necessary details, then the time you spend 
doing keyword research can be wasted. The first step is to lay out a plan based on your 
AdWords goals.
Follow this list of items you need to accomplish before working with your 
AdWords account:
List your marketing goals.  The first step in creating a successful AdWords account is to 
determine your marketing goals. Goals are the reasons you are advertising. If you do 
not have goals, it is impossible to tell if you are reaching your goals or wasting money. 
For a full recap of setting goals, see the section “Setting Your Marketing Goals” in 
Chapter 13, “Devising Profitable Bid Strategies.”
Always be as specific as possible. To make more money or to get more leads is not a 
goal. To increase your ROI from 200 percent to 240 percent or to receive 17 new leads 
a day from Miami is an example of a well-thought-out goal.
Set a priority for each goal. Do not list them as high, medium, and low. Instead, list 
them in order of importance. By making the hard choices of putting them in order to 
begin with, you will find it easier to determine budgets and account organization.
Keep in mind your AdWords Campaign settings as you create these goals, since you 
may want to tailor your goals based on your potential exposure. For example, if you 
are selling insurance in Florida, you might have one goal for the state of Florida and 
another goal for Miami.
Determine your budgets.  Set a budget for every goal you listed. AdWords budgets are kept 
at the campaign level. The minimum campaign budget is $1 per day. Therefore, ensure 
that all of your goals can support a $30 per month spend.
Refine your starting goals based on your budget.  If you find that your budget is not high enough 
to support all your goals, you have two choices. One is to combine some goals. For 
instance, instead of having one goal for Florida and another for Miami, combine them 
into a single goal when you start. However, you should still plan to separate out these 
goals in the future. Periodically review and refine your initial goals.
The second option is to set a budget for each goal in descending order of importance. 
Once you have hit your maximum allowed spend, each goal without a budget will not 
be used (Figure 17.1). Review these goals in the future to see if you can allocate them 
some portion of the budget.
Determine account organization.  Once you have a list of goals and budgets, it is time 
to determine how to organize the campaigns in your account. See “Structuring 
Campaigns to Achieve Business Goals” in Chapter 14, “Organizing Accounts 
Successfully,” for the in-depth details of account structure.

Figure 17.1  Allocating budget by goal importance
When determining your structure, let best practices, budget, and time allocation be 
your guide. For instance, if you want to have all geographic landing pages and ads for 
each city in the United States, best practices tell you to create a single campaign for 
each city. In the United States, there are approximately 300 metro areas. If you have 
a $300,000 monthly budget and someone monitoring the account every day, that is a 
fine strategy. If you are going to have a $3000 monthly budget and someone will moni-
tor the account every few weeks, that is a terrible strategy because your budget will be 
spread very thin over all the campaigns and you will never be able to analyze all the 
data segments with that little time. In that case, you might create only a few campaigns 
and target your top cities or use one ad group per city within a single campaign and 
always use geographic-based keywords.
Also consider additional changes you want to make to the account in your setup. 
For instance, a brand-new account cannot use CPA bidding because it does not have 
conversion history. If you plan on using CPA bidding in the future, then you want to 
ensure each campaign will have enough conversions to enable the feature, so you may 
start with only a few campaigns in this instance.
Install conversion tracking.  For every goal you want to track, set up conversion tracking. 
The conversion-tracking script is tied to the entire AdWords account—which means 
that when you change your account structure, add or remove ad groups, or make 
other changes, the conversion-tracking script will continue to work. See “AdWords 
Conversion-Tracking Code” in Chapter 13 for details on creating and installing conver-
sion tracking.
By installing conversion tracking before creating the account’s details, you can deter-
mine whether the site can support conversion tracking or whether new pages need to be 
created. In addition, you will become more familiar with the content management sys-
tem (CMS) of your website, which is necessary when choosing landing pages and key-
words and deciding on testing methods. By establishing whether any issues exist before 

Chapter 17:  St ep by St ep: Cr e at i ng a n d Mon i tor i ng You r A dWor ds Accou n t  ■
592
creating the account, you will save yourself from having to change all the landing pages 
if a new CMS is installed or new pages are created.
Implementing conversion tracking might not always be done through AdWords. You 
can also do this through Google Analytics or other third-party systems; just make sure 
this step is completed.
Keep this in mind: If you are using alternate conversions such as phone calls, create a 
method for tracking these conversions.
Install an analytics system, such as Google Analytics.  Choose and install an analytics system. 
Google Analytics is a free analytics solution; however, based on your data needs you 
may require a more sophisticated system. The advantage of Google Analytics is that it 
is intimately tied to AdWords with a minimum amount of work.
If you use Google Analytics, then make sure it is also attached to your AdWords 
account so you can see the data in both AdWords and Google Analytics.
Determine if there are other accounts you need.  If you want to use social extensions, then 
you will need a Google+ account. If you want to use PLAs, then you need a Google 
Merchant account. Create the additional accounts as necessary and connect them to 
AdWords.
After you have determined your goals, established budgets, set up campaign 
structures, and implemented tracking, it is time to build the AdWords account.
Creating Campaigns
Once you have determined your account structure, it is time to create the campaigns. 
The three types of campaigns we have discussed are as follows: 
••
Search only: This campaign focuses only on the search network. There are sub-
types of search campaigns, such as IP, GEO, Shopping, and others.
••
Display targeted campaign (also called a discovery campaign).
••
Managed placements campaign.
Name each campaign appropriately so that you can quickly see its purpose. Adding 
items such as geographic targeting, time-of-day targeting, search, display, or mobile to the 
name helps identify your campaign. Here are some sample campaign names:
••
iPhone – California – Search Only – CPC
••
Newsletter Subscriptions – Mobile – Search – CPA
••
E-commerce Specials – USA – Display – Managed Placements – CPM
While I find it useful to name the campaigns very specifically, if you find that 
you have too many naming conventions, you can also use the Labels feature to add 
more detail for each campaign.

If You Are Using the AdWords Editor
If you are planning on using the AdWords Editor to upload most of your keywords and ad copy, it 
is quicker to create all of the campaigns, ad groups, and keywords in the AdWords Editor and then 
upload all the data at once.
If you want to use the interface to ensure that the Campaign settings are correct, create the new cam-
paigns in the interface and adjust the settings, such as budget and geographic target. Next, download 
your account into the AdWords Editor. Then populate the ad groups, ad copy, and keywords into 
the editor using the bulk import functions. When you have finished, upload the new data into your 
AdWords account.
Creating Search Campaigns
Search campaigns are shown only when someone does a search. These campaigns 
do not show up on the Display Network. Follow these steps to create your search 
campaigns:
	 1.	
Determine your Campaign settings.
To create a search campaign, start by determining all of the campaign’s set-
tings. These include, but are not limited to, budget, location targeting, device 
modifiers, bidding options, ad rotation, and ad scheduling. In the Network 
settings, choose Google Search and Search Partners. These initial settings 
determine when, where, and how any ads within that campaign can be viewed 
(Figure 17.2).
	 2.	
Conduct initial keyword research.
The purpose of doing some initial keyword research is to determine all of 
your themes, or ad groups. You do not need to find all of your keywords yet. 
Determine the various ways that people are searching for your products or ser-
vices. Make a list of all your themes.
Focus on differentiating themes based on the buying cycle and wide, informa-
tional, transactional, explicit, problem, symptom, product name, and branded 
keywords.
	 3.	
List your ad groups.
From your initial keyword research, make a list of all the ad groups you want 
to create within your new campaign. By starting with ad groups, you will find 
it easier to organize your keywords and ad copy. Your ad group name is used 
only for organizational purposes. Therefore, use an ad group name that lets you 
quickly identify the ad group’s purpose.

	 4.	
Choose your landing pages.
For each ad group, choose the most appropriate landing page on your website. 
If you have two good landing pages for an ad group, first ask yourself if your ad 
groups are granular enough. You may need more granular ad groups. If you still 
have multiple landing pages for an ad group, make note of them so you can start 
testing different landing pages immediately.
If you are using a different landing page for each keyword, you should move this 
step into the keyword research phase.

■  Cr e at i ng Ca m pa igns

	 5.	
Write one targeted ad per ad group.
For each ad group, write one highly targeted ad. When someone sees this ad, 
they should think that your specialty is selling the product or service that the 
keywords in this ad group provide. Ensure that the landing page you choose for 
the ad group shares the same intent as the ad copy. You may decide not to use 
this ad once your account goes live. The ad is for organizational purposes.
While the draft concept ad shown in Figure 17.3 is not a great search ad, it is an 
excellent organizational ad. It segments businesses from consumers, separates 
Peachtree software from all other accounting software types, and is only for 
businesses in Denver.
Figure 17.3  Highly targeted draft ad copy
	 6.	
Continue your keyword research.
Conduct keyword research for every single ad group. As you choose a keyword 
for an ad group, look at the ad and the landing page. If the ad and landing page 
accurately describe the keyword, it’s in the correct ad group. If the ad or landing 
page does not describe the keyword, then put it in another ad group. You may 
find that you need to create additional ad groups.
Do not start with deep or long-tail keywords. Few accounts should start with 
these word types. Adding deep keywords is an optimization technique to use 
once you determine what words are leading to conversions.
	 7.	
Find negative keywords.
As you are conducting keyword research, take note of keywords that you do not 
want your ad to show for and add them as negative keywords. By starting with 
positive and negative keywords, you can refine your ad display. If you are unsure 
whether a keyword should be a negative, it can be useful to leave it out when 
you first start your account. Later on, you can use the Search Query report to 
see the metrics for these keywords and add them as negatives.
	 8.	
Determine match types.
As you do your keyword research, keep in mind the match types you will want 
to use. If you have a small budget, you will want to start with mostly exact and 
either some phrase or modified broad matches. If you have a larger budget, start 
with more modified broad matches. If you are trying to gather research and your 

Chapter 17:  St ep by St ep: Cr e at i ng a n d Mon i tor i ng You r A dWor ds Accou n t  ■
596
primary goal is not conversions, broad match can be useful. It is okay to have 
the same keyword with different match types inside the same search campaign.
	 9.	
Write ads.
For each ad group, write at least two ads. By starting with at least two ads, you 
are beginning the ad-testing phase immediately. Since a brand-new account 
does not have any metrics, there is no best or worst ad yet. If you have an 
established account, you should run an ad report to see what ads and taglines 
have been most effective so far and borrow those elements when writing your 
next ads. If you have multiple landing pages for your ad group, use the ad and 
landing page testing methodology found in “Testing Profit per Click and Profit 
per Impression” in Chapter 15, “Implementing Testing Techniques That Will 
Increase Profits.” If you want, you can delete the draft concept ad you created 
for organizational purposes.
If you are planning on using positive mobile device modifiers, meaning your tar-
get market is on phones, then it can be useful to also write two mobile-preferred 
ads at this stage so you are testing your ads by device type.
	10.	
Create your ad extensions.
At a minimum, every campaign should use sitelinks. If you are a local business, 
then you should use the location extension and possibly the call extension. If you 
are focused on calls, then make sure you are using the call extension. There are 
several extensions available, and most campaigns should be using at least two to 
three extensions.
	11.	
Set initial bids.
Setting initial bids is difficult since you have very few metrics to work from. 
The best way to set an initial bid is to estimate your conversion rate and profit 
per sale and then use one of the bidding methodologies found in Chapter 13 to 
determine your initial CPC. If there are certain keywords that you think will 
do well regardless of initial bids, you could use the first-page bid estimate to set 
bids. Be careful of using first-page bids in competitive areas. You can easily lose 
a lot of money by overbidding to page 1 if the landing page or keyword does not 
convert as expected.
While it is okay for a keyword to appear twice in a search campaign using dif-
ferent match types, it is not okay for those keywords to have the same bid. The 
exact match version should have a higher bid than the phrase match. If you use 
broad match, that should be the lowest bid among the match types.
By following these steps, you should have a well-organized beginning to a search 
campaign. You will need to refine your keywords, test ad copy, add negative keywords, 
and change bids over time to continuously optimize your campaigns.

Creating Display-Targeted Campaigns
Display-targeted campaigns are shown only across the Display Network. They can be 
triggered through keywords, topics, interests, age, gender, remarketing, placements, or 
a combination of options.
	 1.	
Determine your primary targeting method.
The first step is to choose your primary targeting method. If you are just starting 
out, then you may choose keywords or topics plus placements or even just place-
ments. If you have a larger budget and are expanding your display advertising, 
then you may choose topics or interests. The easiest way to keep display cam-
paigns organized is by using the same targeting method in each ad group.
	 2.	
Determine the Campaign settings.
As with search campaigns, determine all of the campaign’s settings. These 
include budget, location targeting, device modifiers, bidding options, ad rota-
tion, ad scheduling, and more. If you want to use the CPM bidding option, 
make sure that only Display Network is selected before you choose your bidding 
option; the CPM bidding option is not displayed if the campaign is also shown 
on search. Also, set a frequency cap for your ads. These initial settings deter-
mine when, where, and how any ads in that campaign can be viewed.
	 3.	
Create your ad groups.
The ad group creation can change based on the type of targeting you are using. 
If you are using keyword-based ad groups, then your overall organization will 
be similar to search. If you are using topics or interests, then create an ad group 
for each targeting method. If you are using remarketing lists, then create an ad 
group for each list or custom combination.
When creating your ad group, name it something appropriate that describes 
the targeting inside the ad group. In addition, if you are using video-only or 
image-only ads in an ad group, it is a good idea to end the ad group name with 
the ad type for organizational reasons. For instance, Verizon Cell Phone Plan – 
Keywords - Video Ads is a descriptive ad group name.
	 4.	
Create your ads.
There are more ad formats available with the Display Network than with search. 
First, determine what types of ads you want the ad group to have. An ad group 
can contain a mixture of image, video, and text ads because keyword display 
bids are set only at the ad group level. Therefore, it can help to have ad groups 
that show only one ad type, since you may start bidding differently based on the 
ad that will be shown.

Chapter 17:  St ep by St ep: Cr e at i ng a n d Mon i tor i ng You r A dWor ds Accou n t  ■
598
If you find that you want both image and text ads for the same targeting 
method, you can duplicate the ad group and then have one ad group that is only 
image ads and another that contains only text ads.
When creating display ads, do not just think about your keywords; also consider 
the pages that your ad will be shown on and that site’s audience. As with search, 
start with two or more ads for each ad group. When you create your ads, you 
will also choose your destination URLs, so once the ads are created, ensure that 
the targeting method, ad, and landing page all work seamlessly together.
	 5.	
Set initial bids.
Many times your display campaign will reach individuals not yet in the buy-
ing cycle. In these instances, your first conversion option may not be a sale but 
another action to introduce someone to the buying funnel, such as a newslet-
ter subscription or whitepaper download. In this instance, evaluate what you 
are willing to pay for someone to enter your buying funnel and your current 
site conversion rate to determine your starting bid. If you are trying to convert 
display clicks into sales, use the same methodology as with search to determine 
your initial bids.
There are more than two million sites in the Display Network, so if in doubt 
about the initial bid, set a lower bid than you think is required. You can always 
raise your bid if you are not getting enough impressions, but you will never get 
your money back for clicks returned if you overbid.
Following these steps will get you started creating display-only campaigns. Over 
time, you will have to measure results to block sites or categories, change keywords or 
targeting methods within an ad group, and test new ads. One of the steps to optimizing 
display is to determine what sites are sending you good traffic and move those sites into 
a managed placements campaign.
Creating Managed Placements Campaigns
With managed placements campaigns, you can use multiple targeting methods to refine 
your placement on an individual site; however, these additional methods are optional. 
You must choose each site where you want your ad to appear. If you have a small bud-
get or you are new to display advertising, start with a managed placements campaign 
before creating display campaigns that use other targeting methods. You can follow 
these steps to create your managed placements campaigns:
	 1.	
Determine the Campaign settings.
Again, the first step is to choose your initial settings such as budget and geogra-
phy. In the Network Settings section, there are two options, search or display. 
Choose Display Network for your network reach.

■  Cr e at i ng Ca m pa igns
599
	 2.	
Organize your ad groups.
There are three reasons to create ad groups for placement campaigns. The first 
is if you are using flexible targeting with a combination of targeting options. 
In this case, if a new placement needs to be refined with a set of keywords or 
topics, you will add placements to only that ad group when you want those key-
words or topics to also control the ad’s display.
For example, if you were Verizon attempting to market a new Android phone, 
you might have both ads in Figure 17.4 in your AdWords account. One of the 
ads compares the iPhone to the Droid. In this case, you would want iPhone-
related keywords in the ad group so the ad shows up on pages that talk about 
the iPhone. The second ad talks mostly about Droid benefits; therefore, you 
would want a second ad group with more general keywords, such as mobile 
phone and cell phone, to maximize the exposure of this ad on those placements. 
Both of these ad groups can have the same placements in them; it will be the 
keywords in the article that determine which ad is actually displayed.
Figure 17.4  Display Network ads with different purposes
The second reason to create new ad groups is if you want different ads to be 
shown on different placements. In this case, if an existing ad group contains an 
ad you want to be shown on that placement, add the placement to that ad group. 
If there is no ad group with an ad you want to be shown, add the placement to a 
new ad group with the appropriate ad copy.
The third reason is if you are using different types of ads and want to set differ-
ent bids for a placement based on the ad shown. This generally applies only if 
you are using both text ads and rich media ads, such as video or image, to target 
the same site. Because you cannot set different bids for different ads, if you want 
to bid more for image or video ads than for text ads, you will have one ad group 
that contains text ads with a bid and another ad group that has the same place-
ments but uses rich media ads with a different bid.
	 3.	
Find placements via the Placement Performance report.
If you are using the campaign organization discussed in the section “Organizing 
Your Display Campaigns” in Chapter 10, “Utilizing Advanced Display Network 
Techniques,” you will use the Placement Performance report to find sites doing 
well for you and add them to your managed placements campaign. If you do not 

Chapter 17:  St ep by St ep: Cr e at i ng a n d Mon i tor i ng You r A dWor ds Accou n t  ■
600
have any data within your automatic placement campaign, skip this step since 
you will not yet have any placement data to work from.
	 4.	
Find new placements for your ads.
If you want to find highly relevant sites on which to place your ads, you need 
to do research to find them. The best tool to use is the Display Planner tool, 
discussed in Chapter 9, “Understanding the Display Network.” Using this tool, 
along with the Placement Performance report, is the easiest way to find sites 
where you want your ad to be shown.
	 5.	
Create ads.
If you are using the Placement Performance report to find placements where you 
always want your ad to be shown, copy the existing ad that should be displayed 
on the corresponding website when you add the placement.
If you are finding new placements, you can either write new ads or use the ad 
report to find which ads have been successful in your display campaigns. With 
managed placements campaigns, it is still useful to create multiple ads and test 
which one performs best.
	 6.	
Set initial bids.
If you are using the Placement Performance report to find placements for your 
managed placements campaign, you already know the corresponding metrics by 
placement, such as cost per acquisition, and can use the formulas from Chapter 
13 to set your initial bids.
If you are adding new placements and have an automatic placements keyword-
based Display Network campaign, choose starting bids based on the data from 
similar types of placements.
If you do not have access to either set of data, you will have to choose a starting 
bid with little information. The steps will be the same as with the display cam-
paign initial bid information discussed earlier. It is easy to raise and lower bids. 
You should start with a low bid, and if you are not receiving much exposure on 
a site, raise the bid to see how that affects your exposure.
Other Campaign Types
Search, display targeted, and managed placements campaigns are where you will spend 
the bulk of your time with new accounts. However, there are other campaign types you 
can create.
One of the most useful is a retargeting campaign. You create retargeting cam-
paigns much like the managed placements campaigns. However, instead of finding sites 
to advertise on, you will be breaking down your own site into various sections to create 
lists. Your Campaign settings and bid options will be managed just like in a managed 
placements campaign.

Many advertisers, especially small businesses, find more success with remarket-
ing campaigns than with display campaigns. It is okay to use remarketing as your first, 
and only, display campaign.
When considering whether you should create a new campaign, consider the rea-
sons listed in Chapter 14’s “Reasons to Create New Campaigns” section.
It can be useful for many businesses to run IP and GEO campaigns, as men-
tioned in Chapter 11, “Utilizing Advanced Geographic Targeting Techniques.” These 
campaigns are subsets of search campaigns. There are many different campaign types 
that can be created.
In general, the practices of creating these various campaigns are very similar. 
If you understand the overall workflow from creating these three main types of cam-
paigns, you can easily create any campaign type based on your own business needs.
After you have created your initial campaigns, you need to let the campaigns accu-
mulate statistics. When the campaigns have data, it is time to optimize each campaign.
Optimizing Ongoing Campaigns
You will need to regularly run reports to determine how your campaigns are perform-
ing and then make decisions based on that data. In this section, we will examine opti-
mization steps for each campaign type. In the next section, I will show you how often 
to run reports to create a comprehensive reporting schedule.
Optimizing Search Campaigns
The first step in optimizing search campaigns is to determine whether you are going to 
bid at the keyword or ad group level. The most granular bid type, at the keyword level, 
gives you more control. However, it also takes more time to set keyword-level bids. You 
may use a combination of both. For keywords that receive a significant amount of traf-
fic, set keyword bids. For a set of keywords that receive little traffic, use ad group bids.
Making Bid Changes
Based on whether you are using ad group–level or keyword-level bids, you will want 
to run the corresponding report. Use conditional formatting, found in “Revenue per 
Click” in Chapter 13, to make a visual reference chart of your data (Figure 17.5). This 
will give you a high-level look at how profitable or unprofitable the various keywords 
and ad groups are. Next, use the formulas from Chapter 13 to adjust your bids.
If you are making many bid changes, using the AdWords Editor’s Import func-
tion can save you a significant amount of time.
The frequency of bid changes will be constrained by your technology and 
resources. If you are using automated bid systems, you may change bids several times 
daily. If you are using manual systems and you have other responsibilities besides 
AdWords, you may want to change bids only weekly.

Chapter 17:  St ep by St ep: Cr e at i ng a n d Mon i tor i ng You r A dWor ds Accou n t  ■
602
Figure 17.5  Using conditional formatting to visualize the data
If you find keywords that are not profitable, first examine the ad and landing 
pages to make sure they are appropriate. Make any necessary adjustments. The second 
step is to examine the match type. If the unprofitable keywords are in broad or phrase 
match, you may want to look at the metrics in the Search Query report and change the 
match type to be more restrictive, such as exact match, to see how the keyword per-
forms. If a keyword is not performing regardless of ad, landing page, and match type, 
delete the keyword.
The logic just described assumes that you have an unlimited budget if your key-
words are profitable. However, that is rarely the case. If you are reaching your budget 
early in the day and cannot raise it, then delete the keywords that are not receiving 
conversions or that have the highest cost per conversion. The other option is to lower 
your bids for all keywords. It is not uncommon to see an account that has a $100 daily 
budget and is spending $10 per click. This leads to only 10 clicks per day, and the bud-
get is often depleted by noon. In this case, lowering your bids so that your average CPC 
drops to $5 might bring in 20 clicks at the same budget, or better yet, a $1 CPC for 
100 clicks.
Conducting Additional Keyword Research
You will never find every keyword possible; there are just too many different ways that 
people search. However, you can continuously search for new words. There are three 
ways to keep conducting keyword research.
The first is by using the Search Query report. This report will show you what 
someone actually searched for that triggered your ad. If you are using AdWords con-
version tracking, you will also see the conversion rate and cost per conversion by each 
search query variation. Run the Search Query report and look for search queries that 
are costing you money but do not exist as keywords in your account. If they look like 
they would be good keywords, then add them as positive keywords so you can set a bid 
on them explicitly. If the search query or keyword is not leading to conversions, there 
are two steps to take. The first is to examine the associated ad and landing page. If 

■  Op t i m i zi ng Ongoi ng Ca m pa igns
603
the ad or landing page is not appropriate for that keyword, you may want to add that 
keyword to a different ad group that has a more appropriate landing page and ad to see 
if that keyword will be profitable under a different combination. If the ad and landing 
page are appropriate and the keyword is just not profitable, then delete the keyword 
and consider making it a negative keyword so your ad is no longer shown for that 
search.
The exception to deleting the keyword from your search campaigns is if you are 
also using a Maximize Clicks campaign to increase your exposure on early buy cycle 
keywords, as discussed in the section “Understanding Attribution Management” in 
Chapter 13. In the case of words that are not profitable but are leading to interaction 
on your website, delete these keywords from your current search campaign and place 
any appropriate ones into a Budget Optimizer campaign.
The second way to continuously conduct keyword research is to use the 
Keyword Planner’s site-spidering capability discussed in the section “Your Landing 
Page: Jumpstarting Your Keyword List” in Chapter 3, “Keyword Tools: Extracting 
Valuable Data from Google.” If you are ever on a web page that discusses your prod-
ucts, use the site-spidering function to see if there are new keywords you do not have in 
your account yet.
The third method is to set aside time to conduct keyword research. Use the tools 
found in Chapter 3 and spend some time looking for new keywords.
Additional Optimization Techniques
Changing bids is the most common optimization. It is easy to become so focused on 
bidding that other types of optimization techniques are forgotten. Other types of 
account analysis should be performed on a regular basis, such as the following:
Improve your Quality Score.  Quality Score is displayed at the keyword level. However, run-
ning a keyword report and examining all the data can be time consuming. To use your 
time well, run a keyword report and then put the data in a pivot table, as discussed in 
“Increasing Quality Scores” in Chapter 7, “Demystifying Quality Score.” Look for ad 
groups with low Quality Scores and high spends. Then work on the Quality Score for 
that ad group. Increasing the Quality Score in high spend, low Quality Score ad groups 
will lead to the largest gains for your account.
Test your ads.  If you create at least two ads when you initially build a campaign, you can 
start by measuring the results and refining your ad copy. To understand how your ads 
are resonating with your audience, run an Ad Performance report. Take the ad that 
performs the best and keep it. Examine the other ads to see if there are any outliers in 
the data where you can learn from other ads, and then delete the underperforming ads. 
Create new ads for the ad group and continue testing. If you have well-established ad 
groups, you may want the test ad to run only a small percentage of the time. Refer to 
“AdWords Campaign Experiments” in Chapter 15 to run limited tests.

Chapter 17:  St ep by St ep: Cr e at i ng a n d Mon i tor i ng You r A dWor ds Accou n t  ■
604
If your campaigns are running on mobile devices as well as desktops, then also segment 
any tests you perform to see the difference by device and make sure your best mobile 
ads are mobile preferred.
Test your landing pages.  You should continue testing landing page layouts and where you 
are sending traffic to increase conversion rates. Send traffic to different landing pages, 
and then run the Destination URL report to see which landing pages are leading to 
the most profits. Keep the winning test, create new test variables, and continue testing. 
Small changes in conversion rates can lead to large changes in profits.
Adjust your budget based on changes.  The easiest way to determine what you could have 
spent is by using the Impression Share report. This report will tell you why your 
account did not accrue impressions. Combine this report with Google Trends, and you 
can manipulate your budgets so you are spending the most money in your most profit-
able campaigns and less money in your least profitable campaigns.
Analyze trends for ad scheduling.  Analyze your data to determine if there are clear trends 
in your conversion rates or profit based on times of day or days of the week. If trends 
start to emerge, you can use ad scheduling (see “Ad Scheduling: Automatically 
Changing Bids by Time Periods” in Chapter 13) to adjust your bids, or turn your cam-
paigns on and off based on performance metrics.
Before deciding there is a trend, ensure that you have enough data to see a clear pat-
tern. First, run an Ad Group Performance report by hour of day. Next, run an Ad 
Group Performance report by day of the week. Examine these two reports to see if 
there are clear trends. If there are, use ad scheduling to adjust your bids.
Determine geographic performance.  The Geographic report allows you to see your perfor-
mance in different geographic regions. Use this report to find underperforming areas. 
If there are geographies where your conversion rates are lower than normal, you will 
want to either exclude the area, use location bid modifiers, or create a campaign spe-
cific to that area. If you have areas where the conversion rates are higher than normal, 
you may want to create dedicated campaigns for that area to maximize your spend or 
increase your bids in those areas with bid modifiers.
If your advertising reach is too wide—for instance, you are trying to advertise in every 
country with a $100 daily budget—use Google Trends to find areas where users are 
searching for your keywords, and limit your geography until you have the budget to 
start adding new areas.
Although these techniques will get you started optimizing search campaigns, 
you should always be creative when trying to reach your target market. Whether it is 
running different ads by time of day for different geographies or using a single high-
value keyword in an ad group so you can test different ads with that keyword, there 
are many options available within AdWords if you know all the settings. These steps to 

■  Op t i m i zi ng Ongoi ng Ca m pa igns
605
optimization should get you started, but they are not an ending point. You are limited 
only by a combination of your creativity and knowledge of AdWords.
Managing Maximize Clicks Campaigns
When you use the bidding option called “Focus on clicks, AdWords will set my bids to 
help maximize clicks within my target budget,” AdWords takes over your bidding and 
tries to maximize the clicks you are receiving for your keywords.
You can use the maximize clicks option (Figure 17.6) in a search-only or display-
only campaign. Therefore, your initial campaign setup is the same as when you are 
creating search or display campaigns.
Figure 17.6  Choosing Focus On Clicks to enable the maximize clicks option
When using the maximize clicks option for search, ensure that each keyword or 
display targeting method is leading to page views, time on site, and low bounce rates. 
If a word in a maximize clicks campaign is not helping you reach your goals, that word 
should be deleted.
What Is a Low Bounce Rate?
A bounce within Google Analytics occurs when a visitor views only one page of your site. Typically 
when you see high bounce rates, the visitor is on your site for a short amount of time. This usually 
occurs because they did not find the content of the site useful. Your site’s layout does affect bounce 
rates. If someone visits a single page of your site and calls you from that page, they could spend 20 
minutes on the phone, place an order over the phone, and then leave your site. In this scenario, the 
visitor is still considered a bounce even though they are also a new customer.
The specificity of the search query, commercial nature of the term, and design of the landing page all 
contribute to typical bounce rates. For very broad terms such as TV that can have multiple meanings, 
a bounce rate under 60–70 percent is good. For a very specific term, such as a product name, your goal 
is to have bounce rates under 20–30 percent.

Chapter 17:  St ep by St ep: Cr e at i ng a n d Mon i tor i ng You r A dWor ds Accou n t  ■
606
The best way to measure maximize clicks campaigns is through your analyt-
ics system, such as Google Analytics or another analytics program. Viewing time on 
site, bounce rates, and interaction information is crucial to ensuring that these aware-
ness clicks are leading to actual awareness and interaction on your site. If a keyword 
or ad group starts to lead to conversions, you can move it back to your Conversion 
Optimizer or max CPC bidding campaigns to regain control over the keyword’s 
visibility.
If the maximize clicks campaign is your only exposure campaign across all mar-
keting channels, examining the changes to brand searches and direct type-in traffic can 
also give you an idea of any additional lift that this campaign is creating.
Optimizing Display Campaigns
The most exposure you can receive with AdWords is to run display campaigns because 
the reach of the Display Network far exceeds that of search. However, with display cam-
paigns you must take certain steps, listed next, to ensure that your ads are being placed 
correctly, and then you need to make sure your ads are being shown on those sites.
	 1.	
Ensure your ads are being displayed appropriately.
Once you have chosen a targeting method for each ad group, your first optimiza-
tion step is to make sure those ads are being shown on the correct sites. Run a 
Placement Performance report that shows the individual URLs where your ads 
are being displayed.
Click the URLs in the report to see if the pages where your ads are being dis-
played are the types of pages where you want your ads. If they are not, then 
change the targeting, such as the keywords in your ad group, and repeat this 
step.
If the pages where your ads are being displayed are not correct, it is time to 
move on to the next step: blocking websites.
	 2.	
Block websites and types of content.
Examine the Placement Performance report. When you see sites that are not 
meeting your goals, use the Site And Category Exclusion tool or the Interface 
Blocking options to block your ads from being shown on those sites.
	 3.	
Change display bids.
With the Display Network, you can set a default bid at the ad group level. In 
addition, you can set one more custom bid for a targeting type for each ad 
group. This custom bid will override the default bid. If you want to get even 
more granular with bidding, each targeting option can also have a modifier 
associated to it.

■  Op t i m i zi ng Ongoi ng Ca m pa igns
607
If you are using the Display Network to generate sales, set a bid based on your 
marketing goals. Take the Display Network data for your main targeting type, 
and apply the same math from Chapter 13 to set your bids. If your Display 
Network campaign is set up as a discovery mechanism, to find good placements 
that generate sales you will still want to set a bid based on some performance 
metrics, but one of your goals will also be impressions and clicks for each ad 
group. If a targeting methods bid is so low that it is not bringing in any impres-
sions, you will never find new placements. Conversely, if your ad group is receiv-
ing so many clicks that you are quickly hitting your budget every day, you need 
to lower your bids to receive more clicks at the same total budget.
	 4.	
Use managed placements.
When you see a site that is meeting your goals, and you always want your ad to 
show on that site, you have two options.
You can add that site as a placement within that ad group. If you add a site as 
a placement, you can set a bid for that placement only if that is the custom bid 
being used in that ad group. If the custom bid is being set by keyword, then you 
will not want to add a placement to that ad group because you will not be able 
to manipulate the placements bid outside of bid modifiers. You can do it this 
way, but when you use several modifiers the math can get very complex, and it 
is often simpler to add the placement to a different ad group, either in that same 
campaign or within a managed placements campaign.
The second option is to use a managed placements campaign. The advantage of 
using a managed placements campaign is that you can set a higher daily budget 
for the websites that are meeting your goals. In this case, you should block the 
website from the automatic placement discovery campaign and add it to a man-
aged placements campaign. The discovery campaign will be able to find new 
websites that meet your goals, and the managed placements campaign will be 
able to manage sites that are currently meeting your goals.
There will be times when you want to create a placement for a website, yet you 
cannot seem to add that site as a placement. A publisher can control whether 
their website can be targeted specifically for placements. If the publisher does 
not allow this, the only way for your ad to be shown on that site is through 
using automatic placements targeted by your keywords.
	 5.	
Test your ads.
The Display Network reaches a large audience and is a good place to test ads to 
see which is performing best for you. Since the Display Network supports text, 
video, and image ads, you can conduct tests across different ad formats. Testing 
rich media ads in this manner is also useful before doing large CPM buys with 
websites directly.

Chapter 17:  St ep by St ep: Cr e at i ng a n d Mon i tor i ng You r A dWor ds Accou n t  ■
608
When testing ads on the Display Network, run the Ad Performance report. With 
this report, you can segment out each ad type individually so that you see only 
text, video, or image ads.
The Display Network has many options available. You can choose to display 
your ads based on keywords, placements, topics, interests, remarketing, and target-
ing combinations and then segment each ad group with different ad formats. Always 
keep in mind that the Display Network obeys your other campaign settings, such as ad 
scheduling or location targeting.
These steps will help you refine and optimize your display campaigns. However, 
keep your business goals in mind because you may want to use the display in unique 
ways that will cause you to use different optimization techniques.
Optimizing Managed Placements Campaigns
Managed placements campaigns allow you to choose specific placements, either web-
sites or sections of a website, where your ad will show. Because you are choosing a spe-
cific placement, any additional targeting methods are optional. If you have problems 
with your placement campaigns, examine these scenarios to see if one of them pertains 
to your issue to take the appropriate action:
Placements moved from discovery campaigns do not perform.  If you run a Managed Placements 
report and learn that the placements you found in your discovery campaign are no 
longer meeting your goals, do not immediately assume that the placement is no longer 
valid. First, examine these possibilities to see if you can regain the previous targeting.
••
Is a different ad running on the new managed placement than what was used 
in your discovery campaign? If yes, add the ad from the discovery display cam-
paign. You may want to create a new ad group for just this placement and the 
new ad.
••
Did you add the placement but not other targeting methods, such as topics or 
keywords?
••
While the site might be the same, your ad could be shown on different pages 
of a placement if you did not move the other targeting methods. Add the 
targeting method from the discovery display ad group that found success on 
this placement.
••
For narrowly themed sites, you might not always need to move these other 
targeting methods since the entire placement may be relevant to your offer, 
and any other refinements, keywords, gender, and age may actually prevent 
your ad from being shown to a targeted audience.
••
Use the Display Planner to see if you can target a smaller section of the site. If 
you found success on the New York Times and added the entire site as a place-
ment, your ad could easily be shown on a completely different section of such 

■  Op t i m i zi ng Ongoi ng Ca m pa igns
609
a large site. Your ad will convert differently when placed in the leisure section 
versus the business section. In this case, see if you can target a smaller section of 
the website.
Placements added directly do not perform.  If you use the Display Planner to find websites, 
before assuming the websites do not convert, go through two steps. The first step is to 
test different ads. You might even test a couple of image ads as well as text ads to see 
how the different ad formats perform. The second step is to add additional targeting 
options to the ad groups, such as keywords or topics. Adding these other target meth-
ods is more appropriate for placements on large sites, but doing so can help refine your 
exposure on smaller sites as well.
Your ad is not being shown on the placement.  If your ad is not being displayed on a placement, 
there are two common reasons. The first is that your bid is too low. Raise your bid to 
see if your ad starts to be displayed. The second reason is publisher control. All website 
owners can filter certain ads from being shown on their sites. Just as advertisers have a 
category- and site-exclusion tool, the website owner has a similar tool. However, adver-
tisers are not notified if a publisher has rejected the advertiser’s ad or is not allowing 
the advertiser’s site to advertise on the publisher’s site directly.
When you combine placements, ad formats, flexible targeting, ad scheduling, 
and geographic targeting, you have a lot of options for controlling exactly where and 
when your ads are displayed. Creating scenarios, as discussed in the section “Creating 
Scenarios to Understand and Reach Your Target Audience” in Chapter 10, can help 
you put the correct message in front of your ideal audience at the proper time.
Optimizing CPM Campaigns
CPM bidding, also known as Focus On Impressions, is a bid type where you pay for 
an impression, not for a click. This bidding option is available only for campaigns tar-
geting only the Display Network.
To create a CPM campaign, follow the earlier steps for creating a placement 
campaign or a display campaign. Start with only managed placements so you can 
choose each placement and become comfortable with the metrics. Bidding CPM for an 
automatic placement display campaign is possible, but you may waste a lot of money 
having your ads shown on inappropriate sites. CPM keyword bidding is not recom-
mended for a beginner or anyone with a small budget.
With CPM campaigns, you are paying for the impression. The goal is often 
higher brand awareness or to introduce a new product. Since you are paying for an 
impression, not a click, you want every impression to count. Therefore, use only image 
or video ads when bidding CPM. Follow these steps to optimize your CPM campaigns:
	 1.	
Run the Reach and Frequency Performance report.

Chapter 17:  St ep by St ep: Cr e at i ng a n d Mon i tor i ng You r A dWor ds Accou n t  ■
610
The Reach and Frequency Performance report will show you how many people 
saw your ad and how often they saw it over a certain time period. If your ad is 
being seen too often by the same people, change your frequency capping in the 
Campaign settings.
	 2.	
Run the Free Clicks report.
If you are using video ads, your optimization goals should include how 
often a video is watched and how much of the video is being watched. In the 
Dimensions tab is a report called Free Clicks. The report will show you in 25 
percent increments how much of your video is being watched. AdWords video 
ads do not autoplay, so the opening image is crucial to convince someone to 
watch your video. Testing the opening image to find which one leads to a higher 
play rate can drastically increase the success of a CPM campaign. It can be use-
ful to test these images in a CPC campaign while you determine which image is 
best before moving to a CPM campaign.
	 3.	
Enable Viewable CPM or block below-the-fold inventory.
If you are not happy with your overall views or traffic from your CPM cam-
paign, there are two settings you can adjust.
The first is enabling Viewable CPM. Viewable CPM is an option you can use 
with CPM bidding in which Google optimizes your CPM bids in order to get 
your ads shown in ad slots that are more likely to be seen.
The other option is to use the Category And Exclusion tool to block below-the-
fold inventory. Since fewer consumers see ads that are below the fold, by block-
ing this inventory, more of your ads will be seen. Please note that it is okay to 
buy below-the-fold CPM; however, it is useful to set lower CPM bids in those ad 
slots since fewer people will see them.
	 4.	
Measure success for CPM campaigns.
While you can get into complex measurements such as aided brand lift to mea-
sure your CPM campaigns, I will focus on some of the simpler ones. The most 
common goals for online performance advertisers for CPM campaigns are to 
increase awareness and increase interaction with the website:
••
Examine how many clicks you are receiving from the CPM ads.
••
Examine the time on site and page views for those clicks.
••
If using video, examine play rates and length of video viewed.
••
While ads are running
••
Examine changes in direct traffic.
••
Look for an increase in paid search traffic from branded search key-
words. Look for increases for traffic on your homepage, especially the 
entrance page data in Google Analytics.

■  Op t i m i zi ng Ongoi ng Ca m pa igns
611
••
Analyze changes in CTR and conversion rates for your search ads.
••
Examine total conversions and sales.
You can create charts from the CPM data to easily view the performance dif-
ferences when CPM is running. The charts do not have to be complex; you can build 
a simple spreadsheet (Figure 17.7) that allows you to compare two time frames against 
each other.
Figure 17.7  A simple comparison of two time frames
With CPM ad buying, you often need to measure more than just the ad’s metrics 
to determine success. It is not uncommon for a company to buy CPM ads and have 
the ads appear to be a failure. However, perhaps you notice that while those ads were 
running, the conversion rates of the search ads increased by 8 percent. In this case, the 
CPM ads may be the catalyst for the higher performance on your search ads. If so, you 
may want to examine the cost of the CPM ads versus the increase in revenue from the 
conversion rate lift to see if the ads are profitable, based on the influence they had on 
your search campaigns.
Unless you have a sophisticated marketing department that understands how to 
measure success and failure of branding campaigns, you should judge the effectiveness 
of your CPM ads with metrics you can track.
Optimizing Other Campaign Types
Just as with building other campaign types, such as remarketing, topics, interests, and 
others, the steps you will use to optimize the campaigns are similar to the ones just 
covered.
You will manage remarketing campaigns similarly to placement campaigns. 
Examine your goals and the cost per action for your lists, and use a bidding type that 
fits your goals to set these bids.
The most important things to remember are planning out the campaign’s goals, 
having a way to measure those goals, and then setting bids based on those goals.

612
Creating an Optimization Schedule
There are many ways to optimize campaigns based on your goals. With so many 
options available—from finding new exposure by expanding your placements to tak-
ing care of the money by setting bids—you need to create a structured process that will 
help you continuously optimize and grow your account without feeling overwhelmed 
by the options.
I will walk you through what a medium-size account in a semi-competitive 
industry that is being run by an in-house person would do throughout the month to 
optimize their account.
If you manage a small business, or AdWords is not your full-time job, you may 
want to look at some of these reports less frequently. If you manage a large account, 
you might want to break down these reports further so that you are looking at only 
a subset of data instead of the entire account. For instance, instead of examining the 
entire account daily, you may look at five campaigns on Monday and a different set of 
five on Tuesday. If you advertise in a competitive arena, you may want to look at some 
of these reports more often. However, the first step is to put together a time frame and 
what you want to see in each time frame.
Status Check: Every Day  Run a Campaign report that includes every campaign in your 
account. Look for changes in spend, profit, conversion rate, cost per conversion, and 
total conversions. What you are looking for are significant changes from the norm. If 
you find changes, investigate the reason for them. This is your daily AdWords check-in. 
You can also view this information in the AdWords Editor or the AdWords interface.
This will let you quickly see, for example, that your conversions dropped significantly 
and that it’s because you had several ads disapproved. Or your display spend went up 
dramatically because your products were mentioned on CNN and people started look-
ing for the products (in which case you might want to raise your budget).
You can automate this check-in with alerts discussed in Chapter 16, “AdWords 
Reports: Extracting Actionable Information.” However, there are messages that are 
displayed only in the interface, so logging into the interface on a regular basis is a good 
idea to see these alerts.
Keyword Bids: Every Day or Week  Decide how often you want to change bids: daily, twice 
weekly, or weekly. If you want to set bids weekly, choose a day of the week, such as 
every Monday, to make these changes.
Run a keyword report that includes only search data. Use the formulas discussed 
in Chapter 13 to set your bids, add or remove keywords, or move them to a Budget 
Optimizer campaign.
Display Bids: Every Day or Week  As with keywords, choose how often you want to change 
your display targeting bids. It is generally okay to change placement bids weekly and 
not to fret about them every single day unless it is a site that is spending a significant 

■  Op t i m i zi ng Ongoi ng Ca m pa igns
613
portion of your budget. Run a report based on your targeting method and then change 
the bids for your existing targets based on the formulas in Chapter 13. If you are 
changing your keyword bids each Monday, run these reports every Monday as well so 
you know that Mondays are bid-change days.
How Often Should You Change Bids?
You will most likely not change every keyword, ad group, or display target bid every week. There will 
be some that need to be adjusted with new bids, and others will be fine with the current bid. Do not 
feel you constantly need to change bids if your account is doing well.
Most advertisers find that they need to change bids often in new campaigns to find the nice middle 
ground between exposure and conversions, and once it is found, the bid changes become more incre-
mental in nature.
Quality Score Tuesdays  Every Tuesday, work on Quality Score by using keyword reports 
and pivot tables. Quality Score is not updated regularly in AdWords, so keep track 
of the ad groups you have optimized for Quality Score. Leave those ad groups alone 
from a Quality Score standpoint for at least a week; often, two weeks allows time for 
AdWords to catch up to all your changes before you need to optimize the same ad 
groups again. If you are making landing-page changes, it may take several weeks for 
those Quality Score changes to be reflected in your AdWords account.
New Keyword Wednesdays  Every Wednesday, start by running a Search Query report. If 
keywords are not meeting your goals, either make them negatives or put them in a new 
ad group with new ad copy.
If search queries are meeting your goals and are not in your account, add them as key-
words. This is also the time to examine your match types. Technically the same key-
word in broad and exact match is two different keywords. A unique keyword is both a 
keyword and match type combination.
Use the Keyword Planner to do new keyword research. Another option is to book-
mark pages throughout the week that discuss your products and services. On keyword 
Wednesday, use the site-spidering function of the Keyword Planner to spider those sites 
for new keywords.
If you have a small account, you may want to do keyword research every other week or 
monthly. However, set aside a specific time each month to conduct keyword research 
and look for negative keywords.
Display Network Thursdays  Every Thursday, run a Placement Performance report. If place-
ments are not meeting your goals, block them in your Campaign settings. If placements 
are meeting your goals, add them to a placement-only campaign.

Chapter 17:  St ep by St ep: Cr e at i ng a n d Mon i tor i ng You r A dWor ds Accou n t  ■
614
Use the Display Planner to find new placements. If you are doing a minimal amount of 
placements, you may want to run these reports every other Thursday or once per month.
Testing Fridays  You should always be testing. If you set up your ad groups with at least 
two ads, you always have testing data to analyze. There are two types of tests you 
should be running: ads and landing pages.
The first and third week of the month, run an ad report. Examine your ads to see if 
you have enough data to draw a conclusion about which ad is best for each ad group. 
For those ads, keep the best ad, examine the losers for any outliers, delete the losing 
ads, and then write a new ad so you are always testing.
If you are advertising on mobile devices, repeat the same exercise for your mobile-
preferred ads.
If you have a large account and you are testing for both the Display Network and the 
search network, you might just look at search ads on the first Friday and your display 
ads on the third Friday.
AdWords Management Calendar
I am such a fan of a calendar for managing AdWords that I have created one that you can subscribe to 
at CertifiedKnowledge.org. All you need is a free membership to access it. Each of the optimization 
tasks listed in this chapter is there with instructions. Just change the calendar to fit your needs. Some 
companies will need to set bids more often. Others will need to spend more time on display. Add or 
remove items as you need them. Having a basic calendar to start with should save you a lot of time.

■  Op t i m i zi ng Ongoi ng Ca m pa igns
615
The second and fourth week of the month, run a Destination URL report to determine 
which landing pages are performing best for your goals. If you have conclusive data, 
then keep the best landing page and remove the other ones from your tests. If you 
do a limited amount of landing page testing, you might want to just look at a URL 
Performance report the second week of the month and then design new landing pages 
the fourth week of the month.
Trend Reporting: Monthly  Each month, run a Geographic Performance report. Look for 
areas where you are not receiving good returns; then, either write custom ads for those 
regions in a new campaign, set location bid modifiers, or exclude those regions from 
your campaigns.
Each month, examine your ad-scheduling data by looking at conversion data by hour 
and day in both AdWords reports and your analytics systems. If there are changes to 
your conversion rates or cost per conversions, modify your ad-scheduling settings.
Run an Impression Share report to see where and why you are losing impressions. This 
report will give you a snapshot of your visibility for the previous month as well as ideas 
on how to increase your visibility.
Use Google Trends to see changes in your keyword trends so you can take advantage of 
seasonal behavior.
Creating a reporting schedule like this one for your account will help you keep 
track of what needs to be done each day or week, and it will ensure that you are con-
tinuously optimizing the basics.
There are more metrics available in AdWords and analytics than I covered in 
this typical reporting schedule. For instance, the suggested schedule did not regularly 
examine conversion rates by position. Most companies’ conversion rates do not vary by 
position, so you don’t have to constantly monitor those metrics when you have more 
important items to change. You may want to examine some of these additional metrics 
on a quarterly basis.
If there are reports in this suggested schedule that are not applicable to you, just 
skip over them. If there are other metrics you do need to see on a regular basis, you can 
add them to your reporting schedule.
The best way to keep up with these reports is to put them in your calendar as 
recurring items. Then go into AdWords and set up the Scheduling feature so these 
reports are run automatically.
It is also helpful to use a dedicated calendar for your AdWords account so you 
can keep track of notes, changes, and other reminders. For instance, if you are doing 
limited testing and do not want to look at test data every single week, instead of setting 
up recurring reports, add a note in your calendar that you started a test on a certain 

Chapter 17:  St ep by St ep: Cr e at i ng a n d Mon i tor i ng You r A dWor ds Accou n t  ■

day. Then set a reminder to examine that data in one month so you do not forget to 
analyze the test results.
If multiple people work on your account or need access to the data, you can also 
use a project management system to manage the accounts. This is very useful for agen-
cies where multiple people might be working on accounts, or the same person is man-
aging multiple accounts, to keep track of what has been done, notes, and additional 
to-do items.
The more you customize your targeting, the more complex AdWords becomes to 
set up, monitor, and analyze. However, the system is flexible so that if you understand 
all the settings and your company’s goals, you can target users with unique and cre-
ative methods that will ultimately make your business more successful.
Best Practices for Creating and Managing Your AdWords Account
When creating and managing your AdWords account, first refer to the steps in this 
chapter. While each step seems simple, there are a large number of options for each 
step. When any one step involves making decisions that you are not yet comfortable 
making, refer to the chapter where the options behind each step are fully explained.
By using the practices laid out in this chapter, you should be able to successfully 
create, organize, and optimize your AdWords account:
••
The most important step in advertising successfully is first to determine the 
goals for your campaign.
••
Once you understand the goals, you need to find a way of tracking your goals.
••
Next, determine your campaign organization based on your goals and budget. 
When organizing your campaign, make sure you have search-only and display-
only campaigns. Do not have campaigns shown on both networks.
••
For each campaign, determine your ad groups before spending extensive time on 
keyword research. By determining your ad groups first, keyword research and ad 
group organization become more manageable.
••
For each ad group, create keywords and ads. Make sure you include at least two 
ads in every new ad group so you can test ad copy.
••
For search campaigns, use exact and either modified broad match or phrase 
match keywords with small budgets for more control over ad serving. For larger 
budgets and for finding new keywords through the Search Query report, include 
some modified broad match, and possibly even broad match, keywords along 
with the other match types.
••
When creating display campaigns, limit yourself to one targeting method per 
ad group, such as one topic, one interest, or one flexible method such as place-
ments plus topics. It is useful to use only one targeting method per campaign for 
organizational purposes. Do not worry about match types for display keywords;

they are ignored for the Display Network. Include any appropriate negative key-
words—AdWords does take these into account.
••
For more control over the Display Network, use managed placements so you 
know what websites will show your ads.
••
Using a combination of discovery display and managed placements campaigns 
will help maximize both your exposure and control where your budget is being 
spent.
••
Create profiles of your ideal customers and then use Display Planner to find sites 
that are frequented by your target audience.
••
To properly optimize your campaigns, first create a reporting schedule. Set up 
a calendar or project management system with reminders for what you want 
to accomplish each day. Then schedule reports to be run and emailed to you 
automatically so you have data to work with each day and from which to make 
decisions.
AdWords allows you to be creative in reaching your target market. The system 
is flexible so that once you understand how ads are displayed, you can test the various 
variables discussed throughout this book to see which combination leads to the most 
profits for your account.
Following the advice in this book will help you create campaigns, choose key-
words, write ad copy, design landing pages, and put your ad in front of your potential 
customers, which will help you succeed using Google AdWords.
The first ads were cave paintings created several millennia ago. The ancient 
Egyptians were the first to put ads on paper. The first ad to appear in a newspaper was 
in 1704. The first online clickable ad appeared in 1983. Google AdWords launched 
their first PPC product in 2002.
Google AdWords is still in its infancy. Many new features and targeting options 
will emerge over the coming years. By understanding how to use the advanced fea-
tures of AdWords today, you will be able to take advantage of the new capabilities 
tomorrow.
