Introduction
This is special EXTRA report for those who bought the dMayBelfire.com 
download and CPA Offer Platform. I have left most information that is 
already in the “Download Page” blueprint out. Please advise that 
blueprint if you can’t recall some parts in this blueprint.

The dMayBelFire  Download Page Concept
There are basically 2 ways you can go:
•
You can link all copycat sites directly to your Download & CPA 
platform. Be sure to have all right programs uploaded in your 
platform. You don’t want any angry customers :)
 
•
You can use the download page again before you send them to the 
Download & CPA platform to force your traffic to go through one of 
your money making offers (or simply put: ads) first.

You can use the same download page templates for this (the ones that 
come with the package)
Ok guys. Option 1 is by far the nicest solution and your customers will 
love you for instant access to such an amazing free platform.
Unfortunately I have to say that option 2 will simply make you more 
money. If you executed all steps that I described in the Blueprints series 
than 1000’s of visitors per month will go through your download page 
ads…you get the point I guess.

Creating your dMaybelfire Download Pages
There is not really a big difference between the download pages with the 
Download & CPA platform. You can keep them exactly the same. Just be 
sure that you link the program name next to the download button now to 
your platforms domain instead of to the “installer” location.
If you work with one download page to link all your copycat sites to you 
can also work with a more descriptive text like:
  
No, thanks take me to the free download page>>
