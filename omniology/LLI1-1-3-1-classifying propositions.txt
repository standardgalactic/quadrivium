exactly when A evaluates to 1 on every truth
valuation (row of its truth table).

Recipe for constructing truth tables
Given a propositional logic formula A,
1. Write down the formula A (with lots of space), with the list of
all its atomic propositions on the left.
2. Draw enough rows (2n for n atomic propositions), and under
the atomic propositions, systematically list all the different
truth-value combinations of 0s and 1s in the rows (§1-2-1).

Recipe for constructing truth tables
Given a propositional logic formula A,
1. Write down the formula A (with lots of space), with the list of
all its atomic propositions on the left.
2. Draw enough rows (2n for n atomic propositions), and under
the atomic propositions, systematically list all the different
truth-value combinations of 0s and 1s in the rows (§1-2-1).
3. Copy the columns from 2. under the atomic propositions
occurring within the formula A, while leaving space for a column
under each of the connectives within A.
4. Then fill in the columns under each of the connectives within
A, working outwards from the atoms and proceeding in levels as in
examples in §1-2-2 and §1-2-3, until you get to the column for
the main connective of A.

The result of a truth table
If the main column for A is all 1s, then the formula A is a
tautology.

The result of a truth table
If the main column for A is all 1s, then the formula A is a
tautology.
If it is all 0s, then A is a contradiction and ∼A is a tautology.

The result of a truth table
If the main column for A is all 1s, then the formula A is a
tautology.
If it is all 0s, then A is a contradiction and ∼A is a tautology.
If it contains at least one 1, then A is satisfiable.

The result of a truth table
If the main column for A is all 1s, then the formula A is a
tautology.
If it is all 0s, then A is a contradiction and ∼A is a tautology.
If it contains at least one 1, then A is satisfiable.
If it contains some 1s and some 0s, then A is contingent.

Relationship between Tautologies, Satisfiability, Contradictions
Theorem: For any propositional formula A,
A is a tautology
if and only if
∼A is not satisfiable
if and only if
∼A is a contradiction.
