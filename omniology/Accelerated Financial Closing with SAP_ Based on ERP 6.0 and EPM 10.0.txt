James Fisher, Elizabeth Milne, and Birgit Starmanns
Accelerated Financial Closing with SAP
®
Bonn  Boston

Dear Reader,
It seems like everything in today’s modern world is accelerating. In some instances, 
this acceleration can be an out-of-control maneuver that leaves you reeling, but with 
the proper guidance and the right person behind the wheel, accelerating your busi­
ness processes can be exhilarating, record-breaking, and the path to innovation.
I knew a few months into our manuscript development that we had found just the 
right author team to take the wheel. James Fisher, Elizabeth Milne, and Birgit Star­
manns offer a unique blend of true experience and objectivity; they have a sense of 
what information people really need to know and the voice to effectively share it.
Accelerated Financial Closing with SAP spans SAP’s portfolio of finance and analytics 
solutions, including applications from enterprise performance management, busi-
ness intelligence, and governance, risk, and compliance portfolios. To initially con-
ceive of such a topic in a way that the final product is both functional and accessible 
is a challenge. I think you will agree that the authors have delivered on such an 
ambitious title and approach.
Of course, we at SAP PRESS are always interested in your opinion. What do you 
think about Accelerated Financial Closing with SAP? How could it be improved? 
Since your comments and suggestions are the most useful tools to help us make our 
books the best they can be, we encourage you to visit our website at www.sap-
press.com and share your feedback.
Thank you for purchasing a book from SAP PRESS!

Foreword
If you are reading this foreword it probably means you are already involved in 
the world of corporate reporting and financial accounting in some way. Perhaps, 
like us, you are employed in a corporate finance function or providing advice and 
implementation services in a consulting organization; perhaps you belong to the 
audit profession or are employed in an IT role delivering solutions for account­
ing, consolidation, and disclosure; or possibly you are still studying before enter­
ing the profession. It is a role in which some things, such as the responsibility to 
ensure timely and accurate reporting that fully complies with external regula­
tions, will always be constant. But even during the time we have been in our 
roles, we have seen significant changes such as the introduction of Extensible 
Business Reporting Language (XBRL); the steady, but by no means certain, world­
wide move toward International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); the 
increasing complexity of business transactions and the respective reporting rules; 
and the increasing demand from investors and other stakeholders for greater 
transparency and more information about the future, such as that proposed by 
the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).
Although many of these changes that are designed to improve reporting by pro­
viding greater insight on corporate performance have yet to be mandated, the 
management board of SAP recognized some time ago that as one of Germany’s 
largest listed companies and the world’s leading provider of business software, 
we should adopt best practices in corporate reporting at the earliest opportunity. 
This led us to adopt XBRL reporting although we are currently not faced with a 
respective legal requirement. Only recently, we were one of the first companies 
to not only add but integrate nonfinancial information in our 2012 annual report 
in order to help readers better assess the quality and sustainability of our financial 
results. Being part of such innovative reporting is demanding but also particularly 
rewarding. However, freeing up time within our corporate accounting team to 
work on value-adding activities—such as integrated reporting, better visualiza­
tion, and improving the quality of our narrative—means that, like most other 
areas of finance, we constantly need to improve our efficiency and productivity.

Foreword
16
Last year, we made significant headway when we shortened our quarterly report­
ing by one full week, thus setting a benchmark compared to other German com­
panies. Such step-changes in accelerating the speed of closing without sacrificing 
accuracy or reliability are all down to the software solutions that have helped us 
automate much of the manual effort involved in preparing reports so our team 
can now focus more on value-adding activities. We are in the fortunate position 
of being able to work with colleagues in the various solution development teams 
responsible for delivering the SAP Enterprise Performance Management suite, 
many of whom have contributed directly or indirectly to this book. This has given 
us privileged opportunities to meet with the corporate accounting staff of other 
leading companies to help define functionality, to test early versions of the soft­
ware, and to share our successes on reference calls with prospective customers 
and by presenting at conferences.
Like others, we are constantly alert as to how innovative functionality delivered 
in the most recent versions of the software and the new generation of technolo­
gies will help us meet with anticipated changes in regulatory reporting and 
improve efficiency and effectiveness in the future. Already, the availability of 
intuitive and easy-to-use analytics has allowed us to provide stakeholders with 
customizable, slice-and-dice, reporting online, and it will not be long before using 
mobile devices for alerting and approvals will shorten a number of key processes 
in reporting and disclosure. But perhaps the most significant technology that 
looks set to benefit corporate reporting is in-memory computing that will slash 
the time taken to produce or update a financial consolidation from minutes and 
hours down to nano-seconds. There is great excitement within our corporate 
reporting team as they look forward to our first period-end close using our own 
high-performance, in-memory calculation engine—SAP HANA—and we look for­
ward to being able to report transformational improvements in efficiency and 
productivity later this year.
So while we can be sure that corporate reporting will become ever more demand­
ing with the business transactions to be accounted for and the reporting rules 
becoming more complex, the local and national regulators asking for additional 
information, and the analysts and investors seeking deeper insight into corporate 
performance, we can rest assured that software providers, such as SAP, will 
always be there to help us meet and rise above whatever challenges come our 
way.

Foreword
17
In writing Accelerated Financial Closing with SAP, our colleagues and subject mat­
ter experts have produced a book that covers each step in considerable detail all 
the way from the subledger and General Ledger closes, through intercompany 
reconciliation, consolidation, disclosure, and filing. At each stage, they discuss 
the process and access controls that need to be in place to ensure good gover­
nance and compliance and illustrate how automation brings transformational 
benefits with real-life examples provided by SAP valued clients such as Altron, 
HMY, and Sandvik. Having worked as part of corporate finance teams, inside con­
sulting organizations, and most recently for SAP, the authors have a wealth of 
practical experience that they share by providing advice on how to develop an 
action plan for improving your financial reporting as well as and how best to 
implement secure tangible benefits for your organization. The book concludes 
with a discussion of some of the changes in corporate reporting anticipated in the 
future and discusses how companies can best prepare for them today.
Because this book covers both the accounting and reporting processes and the 
technology needed to automate them, we are more than confident that it will be 
a valuable resource to those already working in corporate reporting as well as 
those anticipating entering the profession. Our only regret is that it was not avail­
able earlier in our careers!

Preface
Accelerated Financial Closing with SAP spans SAP’s portfolio of finance and analyt­
ics solutions, including applications from its market-leading enterprise perfor­
mance management, business intelligence, and governance risk and compliance
portfolios. It aims to explain how these solutions can be deployed alongside exist­
ing SAP ERP Financials implementations and break down traditional barriers to a 
fast, high-quality financial close process. This title provides a comprehensive 
guide for finance and controlling professionals seeking to understand how their 
existing and future investments in SAP solutions can be leveraged to help their

quality financial close process.
 Give an overview of the technology landscape that is now available to support 
it.
 Examine the impact of the latest changes to regulatory reporting and the per­
formance management process.
 Demonstrate how industry peers have improved their financial close pro­
cesses, reduced risks, and enabled finance to become a strategic partner to the 
business.
Second, we will address the needs of business process owners and program direc­
tors charged with running and optimizing the financial close process within their 
organization. For this reader, this book will do the following:

Preface

 Set out a clear action plan for how corporate finance teams can approach the 
challenge of improving the financial close process.
 Demonstrate how a new generation of solutions from SAP can systematically 
break down barriers to a fast, efficient financial close process.
 Explain how by converging the previously disparate disciplines of business 
intelligence; governance, risk, and compliance; and enterprise performance 
management on a solid foundation of SAP ERP, finance teams can seek to 
improve service quality and reduce costs.
The chapters in this book break out the key components of the financial close and 
discuss how finance solutions from SAP can be leveraged alongside process best 
practices to achieve immediate yet sustainable improvements to the financial 
close.
Chapter Overview
The chapters in this book are designed to systematically help you with actionable 
steps to improve the financial close process in your organization. The first chap­
ters provide an overview of the key concepts surrounding a fast, accurate close 
process, including an understanding of the drivers for an improved process and 
the most commonly cited barriers to it. We examine the ways in which you can 
build a business case for future investment and outline a simple four-step action 
plan that can be used to design a fast close initiative from the first initial bench­
marking processes through to ongoing improvements.
The subsequent chapters then dissect the most important parts of the financial 
close process and examine in details how the process should function as a practice 
and how technology from SAP can be used to help improve the process. Real-life 
examples help to illustrate how SAP customers are already benefiting from imple­
mentations of these technologies.
The book closes with a look to the future, highlighting key developments finance 
professionals need to be aware to drive long-term sustainable value from the 
financial close process and how this positions finance professionals to better part­
ner with the business, driving not just sound stewardship but entrepreneurship, 
positioning finance as a true strategic partner to the business.

Summary
Ultimately, this book is designed as a practical guide that enables finance and con­
trolling professionals to optimize their financial close process using SAP solu­
tions. Today this portfolio is broader and more extensive than it has ever been 
and by deploying an end-to-end solution for your financial close, not only will 
you achieve a faster more accurate close, but you will provide the basis for 
broader finance transformation whereby the cost of finance is reduced and the 
finance function is positioned as a driver of strategic change across the organiza­
tion.

Improving quality and streamlining the financial close process remains a 
priority for many finance and controlling professionals. Increasing regu­
latory pressures and evolving technologies continue to present both chal­
lenges and opportunities. SAP’s end-to-end portfolio of financial close 
solutions is designed to deliver best practices and enable finance transfor­
mation. This chapter helps you get started.

Introduction to the Financial Close
The earliest records of accounting go back more than 7,000 years. Double-entry 
bookkeeping dates back to the fourteenth century. Today, the landscape for 
accounting and the financial close continues to evolve. Financial excellence is 
achieved when resources, people, and technology are combined to optimize and 
streamline financial processes, decrease operating costs, manage working capital 
and cash flow, and maximize profitability. A streamlined, efficient, high-quality 
financial close process is therefore a key priority for CFOs. The process spans all 
three of the major dimensions of the CFO role: the need to effectively manage 
risk and compliance; the need to help outperform stakeholder’s financial objec­
tives and create sustainable value; and the need to streamline financial operations 
and reduce cost.
In its simplest form, the term financial close describes the process by which a cor­
poration completes its accounting cycles and produces financial statements for 
internal management and external legal or statutory reporting. The requirement 
to close books quickly, with quality and in full compliance with global regulatory 
standards, is key to the ultimate value and success of this process and offers a host 
of complexities than can often cloud what is in essence a well-established busi­
ness process.
In the late 1990s, companies became more efficient at closing their books and 
reporting financial information, but the emergence of compliance regulations 
such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the introduction of International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) placed additional reporting demands on organiza­
tions. The result was that once improved financial reporting processes for many

reverted to a time-consuming and labor-intensive effort to ensure both the qual­
ity and timeliness of financial data. Once again, companies began to invest in 
transformational initiatives for the finance function, often seeking to leverage 
technology to enable this change.
Today’s changing economic conditions, the resulting demands from internal and 
external stakeholders, the changing nature of financial reporting, the importance 
of sustainability, and the growth in new regulatory requirements for the publica­
tion of financial and business data in the form of eXtensible Business Reporting Lan­
guage (XBRL) means that the focus on achieving and maintaining an efficient, 
high-quality financial close process remains critically important.
In fact, research sponsored by SAP and conducted by industry analyst firm Ven­
tana Research in early 2012 shows that compared to 2007, companies are actually 
taking longer to close their books. Of the companies surveyed, 38% can now close 
their quarterly or half year in less than six working days, down from 47% in 
2007.
Closing fast enables quicker access to financial information, which gives manage­
ment the foundation for timely and better informed planning and decision mak­
ing because rather than chasing numbers, financial and business analysts have the 
data at their fingertips and can better respond to ad hoc requests. However, it’s 
not just about speed; efficiency, service, and quality are also key drivers for 
change. Perhaps more importantly, the accelerated financial close demands a 
high-quality close, where processes are monitored to ensure a foundation of 
trusted information for decision making and regulatory reporting. One is not pos­
sible without the other, so in this book, when we use the phrase “accelerated 
financial close,” we are actually talking about the combination of speed, effi­
ciency, and quality.
1.1
The Business Case for a Fast High-Quality Close
Companies seek an accelerated financial close for several reasons. The business 
case for a fast-close initiative is often driven by a combination of benefits for the 
enterprise as a whole, the benefits for the internal and external stakeholders who 
manage the process or use the information it produces, or by a need to comply 
with external financial reporting regulations.

The Business Case for a Fast High-Quality Close
27
1.1
1.1.1
Internal and External Stakeholders
Stakeholders represent the various touch points in an organization where the fast 
high-quality close has a direct impact. Typically, stakeholders include a combina­
tion of people who produce financial information and manage aspects of the 
financial reporting supply chain, who help assure it, and all those who consume 
it. They are both internal and external and include executive management, corpo­
rate, departmental and business unit, subsidiary accounting and controlling 
teams, and business analysts on one hand, and auditors, investors, market ana­
lysts, and increasingly prospective customers on the other.
Communicate to Stakeholders at the Right Time
“The ability to prepare trusted financial statements in a timely manner is not only a 
reflection on the strength of a company’s financial reporting and control systems but 
also ensures finance professionals can communicate the right information to key stake­
holders at the right time.”
—Director of Accounting, Major UK PLC
1.1.2
Regulatory Drivers for the Accelerated Financial Close
Not surprisingly, the single biggest impact on close cycles in recent years has 
been the result of a dramatically changing regulatory landscape. Since the well-
publicized corporate scandals of 2001 and 2002, and more recently the impact of 
the credit crisis in late 2008, businesses have faced an ever-changing regulatory 
landscape, elements of which remain uncertain to this day and in which the only 
certain thing is the prospect of yet more change to come.
Regulation has impacted the financial close process by both increasing the burden 
on financial reporting processes and making it more difficult to report with the 
speed previously enjoyed. At the same time, the same regulations actually set out 
requirements by which an organization needs to report more quickly.
Requirements and changes in the form of IFRS, EU Accounts Modernization 
Directive, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) added complexity to the regulatory 
environment. The United States perhaps bore the brunt of the regulatory burden 
where SOX created an additional financial reporting hurdle for all those compa­
nies that are required to meet the demands of the Securities and Exchange Com­
mission (SEC).

Introduction to the Financial Close
28

On one hand, there was a drive for faster reporting. For example, Section 409 of 
SOX requires public companies to disclose any material event that results in a 
change to the financial condition or operations of the issuer. Under the rules, the 
issuer has four days from the trigger of the material event to report on the event. 
This requires financial and operational systems and processes that bring material 
events to the attention of management more quickly than before.
To add to this are the rules associated with 10K/10Q filing deadlines. These were 
accelerated in September 2005 following an amendment to the SEC Act of 1934. 
Public companies with a public float of more than US$700 million are now sub­
ject to a 60-day deadline for form 10K and a 40-day deadline for 10Q. Similar 
deadlines exist in Europe.
On the other hand, this drive for faster reporting conflicts with our drive for 
greater accuracy. Section 302 of SOX requires the formal management certifica­
tion of the accuracy of financial statements; this covers both omissions and mis­
leading or untrue statements. As a result, those required to put their name to 
these statements now want to take steps to ensure their accuracy, with the net 
effect of increasing the time it takes to produce financial statements.
In addition, Section 404 of SOX has been one of the factors that many believe is 
leading to an increase in the time companies are taking to close and obtain audit 
sign-off. Section 404 requires each annual report of a public company to include 
a report by management on the company’s internal control over financial report­
ing. It also requires the company’s auditor to attest to and report on manage­
ment’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over 
financial reporting—again leading to further delays in the reporting processes.
Other changes are underway as well. We continue to see the ongoing and increas­
ingly global adoption of IFRS and more and more regulators and agencies from 
around the world are requiring the submission of electronic financial data to their 
systems via XBRL. There is particular uncertainty in the United States around the 
conversion or convergence of US-GAAP and IFRS, which only adds to challenges 
many are facing.
This pace of change in the regulatory landscape will also continue to evolve well 
into the future, not just in terms of increasing adoption of standards such as IFRS 
and XBRL but also through the introduction of new standards and reporting 
requirements either on a legal or a voluntary basis.

The Business Case for a Fast High-Quality Close
29
1.1
At the time of writing this book, a particularly interesting example of such a 
development is the proposal currently being formulated and piloted with more 
than 70 global organizations, including SAP for integrated reporting. This new 
approach to reporting extends the external reporting framework well beyond his­
torical financials to span all dimensions of the enterprise, including but not lim­
ited to sustainability-related metrics. The International Integrated Reporting 
Committee (IIRC; www.iirc.com) is currently going through a Consultation process 
having published its draft framework in April 2013.
Such changes will continue to burden financial reporting teams and drive a need 
for internal processes that are capable of adapting and incorporating such changes 
in a cost-effective and non-disruptive way.
1.1.3
Benefits of the Accelerated Financial Close
Organizations can realize numerous benefits by investing to speed financial close 
cycles for both internal management reporting and external legal, or statutory, 
reporting. Overall, closing remains a priority for the majority of companies with 
82% of respondents to the 2012 Ventana Research study indicating that it was 
either important or very important to shorten the financial close process, which is 
consistent with an earlier study that Ventana conducted in 2007.
The benefits of a fast close have multiple touch points both internally and exter­
nally. We have identified some of the most well-researched benefits and subse­
quently the most common contributing elements of a business case for a fast-
close project:
 Faster access to financial information
 More time for value-added analysis
 Work-life balance
 Improved control systems and quality
 Greater time savings and cost savings during the close process
 Better investor relations
In reviewing these benefits, perhaps the first point to note is that good corporate 
governance is inseparable from the benefits of a fast and efficient close. It’s 
impossible to achieve one without the other, and when building a business case, 
an organization should not be looking at a benefit trade-off between quality and 
speed.

Introduction to the Financial Close

Faster Access to Financial Information
By reducing the close time, businesses benefit from much faster access to infor­
mation relating to the performance of their business. As part of an integrated and 
coherent performance management process, this allows management to focus 
attention quickly on problem areas and make faster business decisions to 
improve future performance.
More Time for Value-Added Analysis
By streamlining close processes and reducing the number of staff days required, 
you free significant time for accounting staff. This can be used to add more depth 
and value to the written reports produced at the end of the quarter and year and 
also allows more time for ad hoc financial analysis during the monthly cycle, 
which improves the quality of decision making.
Removing Manual Drudgery
“It’s the ability to remove the manual drudgery, kill that, and give time back to the 
accountants to allow them to do their job. That was the main driver of the business case 
for me and from me to my management.”
— Former FTSE 100 Company Financial Controller
Work-Life Balance
It’s also important not to overlook how the fast close creates a more manageable 
work-life balance for staff in the accounting department. Quite often, the length 
of a close cycle is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the effort involved, 
and it’s not uncommon for staff to work significantly longer hours during the 
close. Chapter 8 discusses intercompany reconciliation in more detail.
Improved Control Systems and Quality
A financial-close initiative should establish a number of best practices for finan­
cial reporting, including automation, workflow management, and data-entry val­
idation. One of the keys to a fast close is “right-first-time” reporting, which not 
only increases quality earlier in reporting processes, but the additional time spent 
on analyzing the data also leads to better quality reporting that delivers greater

value. Because the fast close is about streamlining and industrializing the close 
process, internal control systems are inherently improved, which, in turn, im­
proves the audit sign-off process.
Greater Time and Cost Savings during the Close Process
The cost impact of a fast close is substantial. A streamlined close process offers 
time savings in terms of manual intervention, error reconciliation, variance anal­
ysis, and data processing and collection across a variety of close processes. These 
time savings can then be quantified into numbers of staff days, which, in turn, 
can result in reduced head count, fewer temporary staff working on low-value 
activities, and reduced recruitment costs. These savings, however, are not limited 
to possible financial rewards. When applied to value-added activities, freed time 
increases revenues and lowers costs. Particularly relevant is the application to 
Section 404 of SOX, where fast-close initiatives not only aid compliance but also 
assist in driving down the high costs associated with Section 404 compliance by 
establishing sustainable and repeatable processes to reduce audit fees.
Better Investor Relations
The ability to publish statutory results ahead of shorter regulatory deadlines is, in 
itself, only part of the benefit for companies that close fast. Publishing faster than 
industry peers and more closely monitoring business performance are associated 
directly with the management capability of a company and, in turn, the com­
pany’s image. It not only implies a level of expertise but also allows for speedier 
communication at a greater level of detail to investors and analysts, giving them 
greater comfort. Additional transparency enables greater access to capital for 
those reporting earlier. It means the reporting of material events can be per­
formed in a timelier manner, which can have a positive impact on stock value. 
Additional analysis, including the use of narrative and commentary, also has a big 
impact on how a company is perceived. The importance of maintaining good 
financial close processes is also reinforced by many of the traditional financial 
services rating agencies that have introduced specific financial governance prod­
ucts. These products, like credit ratings, serve to measure and report the financial 
health of a company, particularly those that are publicly traded. Governance 
Metrics International, Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch Ratings record a

range of measures spanning audit integrity to the quality of financial disclosures 
and controls. These metrics are critical because they have a direct impact on the 
cost of capital, which in itself presents a compelling reason to invest in reducing 
the time it takes to close and report.
1.2
Components of the Financial Close
Not unsurprisingly, there are varying views on which capabilities should form 
part of an overall financial close solution. Certainly, the most common views as 
defined by financial close solution providers tend to focus on one specific area 
covered by a product they have developed. Others, including leading IT industry 
analysts, have also attempted to define the process steps, which has led to the 
emergence of a relatively new category of financial close solutions and processes: 
financial governance processes and applications.
Gartner’s Definition of Financial Governance Capabilities
Gartner states that the financial governance capabilities are: “Financial consolidation, 
financial statement generation, intercompany transaction management, reconciliation 
management, financial controls and compliance, financial close management, access 
and segregation of duties controls, financial risk management, financial analytics.”
—Gartner, Inc. “Gartner Q&A: Current Issues in Financial Governance”, April 2011.
The most established of these definitions was delivered by Gartner Inc. and was 
most recently updated in April 2011. However, while this definition provides a 
good overview of the component parts of financial governance, the category itself 
fails to fully represent the entire end-to-end process. In particular, it does not 
cover a number of closing steps within the General Ledger, associated subledgers, 
as well as the critically important requirements surrounding data and master data 
management.
As a result, SAP’s view on the components of the financial close, while entirely 
inclusive of the elements set out by Gartner, is differentiated and unique in the 
way it seeks to encompass and support the close process along the entirety of the 
financial reporting supply chain—from source transaction through to digital dis­
closure. The resulting solution therefore spans SAP’s portfolio of finance solu­
tions, including SAP ERP Financials; Enterprise Performance Management (EPM);

SAP Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC); and SAP BusinessObjects Business 
Intelligence (BI), as shown in Figure 1.1.
Subsequent chapters in this book will examine the most critical components of 
the close process at a detailed level by articulating how SAP solutions can enable 
an accelerated high-quality close in your organization.
1.3
How Fast Is Fast?
When measuring the speed of a financial close, it’s important, as Section 1.2 indi­
cates, to understand that there are numerous ways in which the close process can 
be defined and ultimately be measured. It’s critical to ensure you are comparing 
apples with apples in terms of the way days are counted and which part of the 
process you are counting.
First, it’s important to understand if you are counting in elapsed days that include 
weekends, or working (or business) days. Second, you need to understand exactly

what is meant by “the close.” The definition will of course differ depending on 
whether you are looking at a legal or management close process, but some refer 
to the entire process—from period end, through to published financial state­
ments—while others describe the close as simply the number of days between the 
period end and the point by which financial information is delivered to the 
group. It’s important to determine how you will measure your process and com­
municate this definition consistently.
The simplest and most publicly accessible way to establish a fast-close benchmark 
is to look at the published legal year-end reporting periods, including the time 
taken to announce results and the time to obtain audit sign-off. BPM Interna­
tional, a network of consulting firms specializing in financial close and perfor­
mance management consulting, completed its last study of more than 1,000 
global companies in 2011 and found extremely diverse results, with the fastest 
company to report being Cisco Systems, which announced results in just 11 days 
after the end of the year. As you would expect, BPM International (www.bpm-
international.com), a network of consulting firms specializing in financial close 
and performance management consulting, completes an annual study of the 
financial close processes at more than 1,000 global companies and its 2013 find­
ings show that the fastest company to report was Wells Fargo, which announced 
results in just 11 days after the end of the year. As you would expect, there are 
significant differences between the best and worst performers, as well as signifi­
cant geographic variations, with the best performers in the United States typically 
closing faster than those in Europe. The fastest performers in Europe were Novar­
tis, Unilever, and SAP all reporting in 23 elapsed days, equivalent to 56th fastest 
globally.
As indicated earlier in this chapter, the study conducted by Ventana Research in 
early 2012 shows that compared to 2007, companies are actually taking longer to 
close their books. Only 38% of companies surveyed can now close their quarterly 
or half year in less than six business days, down from 47% in 2007 (see Figure 
1.2). In terms of the monthly close process, the picture is not much better with 
only half of those surveyed closing their books in less than six business days of 
the month end, down from 70% on the 2007 numbers (see Figure 1.3).

There is no 100% right or wrong answer as to how fast a company should close 
and report. To determine how quickly you should close and report, you need to 
understand where you sit compared to your peers, either by geography, industry, 
or organizational size, and how this relates to the relative complexity of your per­
formance management and financial reporting process. Determining this bench­
mark should be the first stage of any close project because it helps you establish 
a SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) objective 
on which you build a project plan to shorten your reporting time. We will return 
to this SMART concept in Chapter 2.
1.4
Barriers to a Fast, High-Quality Close Process
Considering the growing complexity of the financial close process and the multi­
ple touch points and opportunities for failure, it’s not unsurprising that there is a 
vast array of prospective barriers to a fast, high-quality close process. The major­
ity of these barriers are related directly to the processes, people, and technology 
that can be found at both the head-office and reporting-unit level and affect mul­
tiple teams and processes. In addition, numerous “environmental” issues add to 
the challenges many organizations are facing.
By identifying and understanding these barriers, you can outline a strategy 
through which you can remove them systematically from your close process. Some 
of the most frequently cited barriers—based on our experience of supporting fast-
close initiatives in the corporate centers of today’s global enterprises—are pre­
sented in Figure 1.4. Each of the identified barriers has been grouped according to 
type—compliance, people, process, and technology—which immediately provides 
an indication as to how you may start to think about addressing these barriers. 
Although we are confident that this list is representative, it’s important to note that 
it’s not an exhaustive list, so your own organization may not identify with all of 
these and there may be barriers to your own financial close that are not listed. 
A first step in any close project is therefore identifying which apply to your close 
process and which do not, a topic we will return to in Chapter 2. We have taken 
the most common barriers and have explained these further in Section 1.4.1
through Section 1.4.6. They include compliance-related pressures, data quality and 
collection errors, intercompany reconciliation, poor performance from consolida­
tion applications, lack of process automation, and weak audit trails.

Compliance-Related Pressures
Although compliance-related issues are often seen as a hindrance to a fast close, 
compliance should itself not be seen as a direct barrier to a world-class financial 
close process. In many respects, compliance processes, particularly strong con­
trols processes, should help streamline functions if implemented correctly and 
with the right degree of automation. However, the fact remains that compliance 
and an ever-changing regulatory landscape has and continues to make life more 
complicated. Many do in fact directly contribute the delays reported by the Ven­
tana Research study as a direct result of a combination of both economic and

compliance-related pressures, with 49% of respondents indicating this is the rea­
son for their longer reporting cycles.
1.4.2
Data Quality/Collection Errors
The inability of many to achieve a “right first-time” close process is a critical bar­
rier to the fast close and is a symptom of many broken or failing processes and 
systems. It’s linked to manual data entry, late delivery from reporting units, a lack 
of validation and controls, poor integration with source systems, and a lack of 
integration across multiple close processes. Data needs to be collected often from 
different charts of accounts and multiple sources, including different ledger sys­
tems, HR systems, and spreadsheets. Once collected, the data must be normalized 
into a common chart of accounts so the real process of consolidation in accor­
dance with often multiple accounting standards can begin. Often the data col­
lected will be both financial and non-financial, and it will include supporting text 
and commentary.
1.4.3
Intercompany Reconciliation
The intercompany process all too often sits on the critical path for the close cycle 
causing significant delays while operating units resolve unmatched intercompany 
transactions and balances. Time spent at both the head office and local operations 
contributes to a significant number of man-days, which are needlessly wasted on 
this essential but cumbersome process. This has for many years been cited as one 
of the most common and frequently occurring barriers to a fast-close process.
1.4.4
Poor Performance from Consolidation Applications
The consolidation process is by its nature iterative and involves many rounds of 
consolidation, review, and adjustment before the process is finalized. The perfor­
mance of consolidation applications is becoming highly important as organiza­
tions look to enhance the close process and save time in every area. In the first 
wave of fast-close projects, many companies moved from spreadsheet-based 
models to a best-of-breed closing application to gain some speed advantage; 
however, in doing so, these companies became hampered by ingrained perfor­
mance issues. Many are now seeing this as a bottleneck on the critical path, and

as they optimize other elements of the close process, the delays caused by poor 
performance on numerous iterations of the consolidation mount and become 
more measurable. Chapter 9 discusses consolidation in more detail.
1.4.5
Lack of Process Automation
The close process comprises multiple elements, many of which can be automated 
to both directly speed the close process and indirectly achieve a faster close by 
reducing errors or freeing time. Examples of key processes that can be automated 
include intercompany matching and elimination, internal controls testing, con­
solidation entries, currency conversion, business rules, ownership and control 
calculations for minority interests, equity elimination, cash flow, and GAAP con­
versions. However, the so-called “last mile of finance” has probably become the 
area where the most scrutiny is now being placed in terms of both increased auto­
mation and increased collaboration across the finance organization. Over recent 
years, new reporting requirements resulting in a need for more detailed disclo­
sures and new filing requirements in the form of XBRL have increased complexity 
and as a result slowed this part of the close process considerably.
1.4.6
Weak Audit Trails
Not only an issue during the close process where central finance teams may seek 
to investigate and verify figures, the lack of strong audit trails also have a key 
impact on the post-close audit sign-off in compliance with SOX 404 and the costs 
associated with it. According to Ventana Research, 40% of respondents indicated 
more complex approval and sign-off processes were the cause of the delays they 
were seeing in their close process as Figure 1.5 indicates. A detailed and auto­
mated audit trail from source to disclosure (including the last mile of finance) can 
be a key tool especially when a close process, as so many do, features lots of late 
data changes and journal entries. However, even when some systems do feature 
rudimentary audit features, it is often at the expense of application performance, 
one further impact that has become a close barrier in its own right.

Summary
Establishing a common framework for the financial close across your team is crit­
ical in any close project. This first chapter has set out to do that in the context of 
this book so that the reader has a common understanding of the way in which 
SAP views the close process. Understanding the business case drivers, how 
quickly people report today, and the most common challenges in the financial 
close process is therefore critical as we move on to the next chapter in this book, 
where we will look at how this understanding can be applied to construct a 
project action plan for your own financial close initiative.

For all transformational projects, it’s critically important that you define 
a project plan that helps you set out your objectives, demonstrate success, 
manage change, and ultimately drive a long-term business outcome. This 
chapter examines the need for such an approach and proposes a structure 
readers can implement as part of their own fast-close project.

Creating an Action Plan for Improving 
Your Financial Close
Understanding the drivers and barriers for a faster close process is important, but 
before you can start your project, you need to plan for it effectively. A financial 
close project, like any other corporate initiative, requires a structured approach 
with a methodology that’s supported by people, process, and technology; is man­
ageable; and has clear but realistic objectives. A full financial close project can 
and, in most cases, must extend beyond corporate-centric processes and func­
tions and therefore involve a broad community that adds complexity to the pro­
cess.
That being said, the project doesn’t necessarily have to result in a major change 
program and—provided you structure your approach, deliver the appropriate 
and sponsored resources, and manage the project—it’s possible to make signifi­
cant gains relatively easily.
As a result and based on our experiences working with our partners and custom­
ers, we advise that you create an action plan for your project that breaks down 
the transformation process into meaningful but manageable steps. There are a 
number of ways to create and build such a plan, and many consultancies and 
indeed SAP partners will be able to offer their own approach. Typically, however, 
they all focus around four principal steps. For the purposes of this book, we have 
created our own action plan, which represents these market best practices and 
spans the following four steps. We will go on to explain each of these in more 
detail in this chapter.

1. Establish vision, benchmarking, and sponsorship.
2. Implement quick wins.
3. Identify and deliver big wins.
4. Establish a framework for continuous improvements.
The aim is very simple: to create a project plan that can be delivered based on 
your existing or budgeted resources and that guides you through the process to 
set out your objectives, demonstrate success, manage change, and ultimately 
drive to a long-term business outcome.
2.1
Vision, Benchmarking, and Sponsorship
It is often said that poor project planning is one of the primary causes of project 
failure, so starting out on the right path from the beginning is critical. To be suc­
cessful, the first stage of an effective project plan needs to establish a clear set of 
goals based on a detailed as-is review, which will help you define your vision and 
objectives for the close. This vision needs to articulate the benefits your project 
will bring to the organization and then acts as the basis on which you establish 
clear sponsorship from senior management.

Figure 2.1 demonstrates this stage, the core components, and how a complete 
project plan needs to be aligned around a continuum of change management. We 
will detail each of these core components in the subsequent sections of this book.
2.1.1
Perform “As-Is” Review
As discussed in Chapter 1, there is no 100% right or wrong answer as to how fast 
a company should close and report. As a result, you need to determine this based 
on a number of factors (typically industry, size, and geography), which are spe­
cific to your own organization. However, before you can define a target, you first 
need to conduct a review of your own processes and benchmark those with 
peers.
The review piece is critical, and you need to clearly map out your financial close 
process. It might be prudent to do this in the form of a project plan or process 
flow diagram where you determine who is involved, the flow of data and finan­
cial information through the process, the critical path, and key milestones. You 
should make careful notes of the resources, costs, and time frames involved at 
each stage of the process, as well as the IT systems that support it. It’s unlikely 
that all of the information you will need will reside in one system.
You also need to understand where you sit compared to your peers—by geogra­
phy, industry, or organizational size—and how this relates to the relative com­
plexity of your performance management and financial reporting process. 
Benchmarking is something individuals do relatively easily by determining stan­
dard metrics (such as how long the close takes) and simply comparing to a 
defined peer group. Alternatively, most consulting organizations with established 
financial close practices will have more complex benchmarking processes that 
they can apply to your organization. By combining peer benchmarking at various 
stages of the financial close process with your detailed as-is review, you should 
create a solid foundation on which you can identify which of the typical barriers 
to a fast close (as discussed in Section 1.4) apply to your organization and in turn 
which of these you need to focus your efforts on. You can then start to define the 
next part of the process relating to how you want to improve and address these 
barriers.

2.1.2
Define Vision and Benefits
After you have reviewed your own processes, the next step is to define your 
vision, which primarily equates to a description of how you want your close 
process to run and in doing so set out the benefits you expect to deliver for the 
business based on those we discussed in Section 1.1.
Your targets should represent resources, timelines, and costs, and although taking 
a view across the entire process may be easier, you may find it more effective 
long term to break your targets down by subprocesses. For example, you may 
determine that you should receive financials into the group HQ by working day 3, 
and complete the corporate close by working day 5, as opposed to simply saying 
the entire process should take 8 days.
As we first discussed in Section 1.3, objectives should be “SMART” (specific, mea­
surable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) and ultimately should become the 
yardstick for your entire project by which you measure progress and success. For 
more information, Paul J. Meyer describes the characteristics of SMART objec­
tives in Attitude Is Everything (The Meyer Resource Group, 2003).
Specific
When defining objectives its first important that you select a specific goal over 
and against a more general one. This means the goal is clear and unambiguous; 
without vagaries and platitudes. To make goals specific, they must tell an individ­
ual or team exactly what is expected, why is it important, who’s involved, where 
is it going to happen, and which attributes are important. A specific goal will usu­
ally answer the five “W” questions:
 What: What do I want to accomplish?
 Why: Specific reasons, purposes, or benefits of accomplishing the goal.
 Who: Who is involved?
 Where: Identify a location.
 Which: Identify requirements and constraints.
Measurable
Its also critically important that you leverage concrete criteria for measuring 
progress toward the attainment of the goal. It goes without saying that if a goal is 

Vision, Benchmarking, and Sponsorship
45
2.1
not measurable, it is not possible to know whether a team is making progress 
toward successful completion. Measuring progress is supposed to help a team 
stay on track, reach its target dates, and experience the exhilaration of achievement
that spurs it on to the continued effort required to reach the ultimate goal. A mea­
surable goal will usually answer questions such as the following:
 How much?
 How many?
 How will I know when it is accomplished?
Achievable
Setting objectives that teams cannot possibly meet is not motivational so although 
an goal may stretch a team in order to achieve it,it must be realistic and attain­
able. When you identify goals that are most important to you, you begin to figure 
out ways you can make them come true. You develop the attitudes, abilities, 
skills, and financial capacity to reach them. The theory states that an attainable 
goal may cause goal-setters to identify previously overlooked opportunities to 
bring themselves closer to the achievement of their goals. An attainable goal will 
usually answer these questions:
 How can the goal be accomplished?
 What resources do I need to accomplish it?
Relevant
Its also important that you choose goals that matter. In the context of a fast close 
project, a goal to “Ensure 75% of sales orders are delivered within 3 working 
days” may be specific, measurable, attainable, and time-bound, but it lacks rele­
vance to project in hand. Many times, you will need support to accomplish a goal: 
resources, a champion voice, someone to knock down obstacles. Goals that are 
relevant to your boss, your team, and your organization will receive that needed 
support. Relevant goals (when met) drive the team, department, and organization 
forward. A goal that supports or is in alignment with other goals would be con­
sidered a relevant goal. A relevant goal can answer yes to these questions:
 Does this seem worthwhile?
 Is this the right time?

Creating an Action Plan for Improving Your Financial Close
46
2
 Does this match our other efforts/needs?
 Are you the right person?
Time-bound
Finally the use of a specific time frame in goal setting is important as it gives a tar­
get date for which an individual and team and work towards. A commitment to a 
deadline helps a team focus its efforts on completion of the goal on or before the 
due date. This part of the SMART goal criteria is intended to prevent goals from 
being overtaken by the day-to-day crises that invariably arise in an organization. 
A time-bound goal is intended to establish a sense of urgency. A time-bound goal 
will usually answer these questions:
 When?
 What can I do six months from now?
 What can I do six weeks from now?
 What can I do today?
By defining SMART objectives as outlined, we can now have a definite idea of our 
vision for our financial close process and clearly articulate the benefits to our 
business of such an undertaking. The next step in our action plan is sponsorship.
2.1.3
Sponsorship
This is a critical part of the project, and while there is some evidence to suggest 
that a lack of sponsorship will hinder your chances of success, there is signifi­
cantly more evidence to demonstrate that the most successful projects have 
extremely strong executive project sponsorship.
It’s important at this point not to confuse project sponsorship and project man­
agement. The latter manages the project day to day and is responsible for deliv­
ery. The role of the executive sponsor is a role within the project management
function. Usually a senior member of the project board and often the chair, the 
sponsor will typically be a senior executive who will be responsible to the busi­
ness for the success of the project. Depending on your size of organization and 
the scope of the project, exactly who this is may, of course, vary.

Vision, Benchmarking, and Sponsorship
47
2.1
The sponsor has a number of responsibilities for the project:
 Provides leadership on the organization culture
 Owns the overall business case
 Keeps the project aligned with the organization’s strategy and direction
 Governs risk associated with the project
 Focuses on realizing benefits
 Identifies opportunities to optimize cost/benefits
 Drives sponsorship
 Provides feedback and lessons learned
The sponsor will therefore become a primary stakeholder for the project man­
ager, and typically they will interact around things such as the decision-making 
framework, the business priorities and strategy, support for communication to 
the wider business, and a host of other associated governance activities. The exec­
utive sponsor needs a range of skill sets, including appreciation of corporate strat­
egy, ability to prepare a business case, and profound knowledge of the 
organization’s operations. The sponsor also needs to know his way around the 
organization and command respect within it. The project sponsor and project 
manager should form an effective partnership with each other. The project man­
ager should orchestrate all players involved in delivering the project while the 
project sponsor coordinates all departments of the organization and associated 
stakeholders to ensure the full benefits from the business case. Again, the precise 
structure of the project team is somewhat dependent on your organization and 
scope of the project. Although the roles are distinct, it may be possible for one 
person to drive both roles in smaller projects.
Ultimately, however, in the case of the financial close, the more senior the spon­
sor the better. Although in most organizations the financial controller owns the 
overall close process, the most successful fast-close projects are typically spon­
sored by the CFO. Some level of reporting to the CEO on large transformation 
projects is also not uncommon.
Sponsorship from the outset of the project is critical, but it is possible to grow 
sponsorship over the duration of the project. This is critically important as we 
move into the more complex and challenging parts of the transformation. The 
starting point is to focus on a series of quick wins.

2.2
Quick Wins
The second stage in the action plan covers the implementation of your quick 
wins, and essentially this is where most people will feel the rubber hit the road 
and where you start to actually make changes to your financial reporting process 
that will result in tangible benefits in both the speed and quality of your financial 
close process. Figure 2.2 sets out this stage of the process and shows four of the 
most common quick wins to consider:
 Creating a close scorecard
 Peer-to-peer intercompany reconciliation
 Right-first-time close
 XBRL publishing
Before we explain these in more detail, it’s critical to understand why quick wins 
are so important to your project. Ultimately, it is simply not possible to change 
the entire close process in one go, so quick wins serve to demonstrate that time 
savings are achievable, which in itself reinforces the level of executive sponsor­
ship a project receives and puts people into a positive and determined frame of 
mind for delivering the bigger wins. The key is to understand that not all of the 
barriers to a close require huge amounts of effort to improve. In some cases, it is 
possible to very easy make significant gains. Keep in mind that the position of 
each win will vary based on the specifics of your organization.
The trick is to evaluate the options open to you and prioritize them according to 
the amount of time and effort needed to implement and the size of the impact on 
your close cycle. Those with the least required effort but maximum impact are the 
most attractive and should be your quick wins. Conversely, those that require a 
significant event but are also deemed to have a big impact are known as big wins 
(discussed further in Section 2.3). Naturally, anything that requires a big effort 
and that will have very little impact on the performance of your close process 
should be considered out of scope unless there is another compelling reason to 
address this, such as cost, for example. Figure 2.3 represents a simple way to com­
pare and contrast the various efforts and can be used to help select which wins to 
focus on.

While later chapters will look at a number of these quick and big wins in more 
detail, particularly showing how SAP solutions can support them, it’s worth illus­
trating a few to fully explain how they work as quick wins and add value.
2.2.1
Creating a Close Scorecard
It is often said that what gets measured gets managed, and this holds very true for 
the financial close process. Although a reasonable proportion of the customers we 
work with measure and record different aspects of the close process, it’s surpris­
ing how few, in fact, the vast majority, simply fail to report on this data and put 
it to good use. Those organizations that are typically best in class at the financial 
close, on the other hand, do make good use of the data.
They do this by creating a close scorecard, which serves to collect data and report 
on the effectiveness of different stages in the reporting process. The most com­
mon approach is to report on the time it takes for operating units to report finan­
cials to the central team. This information can then be used to show the best and 
worst performers in a group. Such a scorecard need not be complicated and in its 
simplest form can simply be a league table showing who is fastest or on time and 
who is lagging and slowing the process. Repeated monthly, this soon becomes a 
strong motivational tool as no one likes being held out as a poor performer.
It’s of course possible to create more complex models as Figure 2.4 illustrates, but 
one of the most effective we have seen is still relatively simple provided your 
financial reporting systems are capable of recording and collecting the data. 
Essentially, central teams collect data on a number of dimensions spanning the 
time it takes for an entity to report, the number of errors associated with the sub­
mission, and the materiality of the entity to the overall group’s financial position. 
Then, they can plot this on a bubble chart with speed and error representing the 
two axes and the size of the bubble representing materiality. As indicated, the 
example in Figure 2.4 is more complex and records many more details, including 
data points on individual subprocesses and owners of those processes. The depth 
of complexity is again up to the organization and the scope of the project, but 
clearly, any level of monitoring has a significant impact.
Although more complicated, such an approach allows for a further level of man­
agement and ultimately coaching. Clearly submitting on or ahead of deadlines is 
good, but if the process is full of errors, then it’s a wasted effort. In addition, an 
entity that is highly material to the overall financial position of the business and 

Quick Wins
51
2.2
is only a few hours late may actually be more important to fix than an immaterial 
entity that is a few days late.
By looking at the different dimensions just described, a more effective manage­
ment process can be implemented where best and worst performers are more 
easily identified and where the best practices of the best can be used to coach the 
worst. We have seen many organizations use this as part of a formal post-close 
review process after each close cycle is completed. Some even go as far as to use 
such benchmarking as part of the management by objectives (MBO) process for 
key controlling staff.
Chapter 6 of this book looks at various aspects of process governance and entity 
closing in more detail. This chapter will focus on how the SAP Financial Closing 
Cockpit can be used to help measure and manage the entity close process.
2.2.2
Peer-to-Peer Intercompany Reconciliation
Monitoring and managing the process as a whole will only get you so far, how­
ever, and sooner or later, you will have to address fundamental issues in your 
Figure 2.4  Example of a Close Dashboard Report

close process, including accounting practices. In all the time that we have worked 
in the financial close process, the area that has consistently been identified as a 
major cause of delay is intercompany reconciliation. As Section 1.4.3 highlights, 
the intercompany process all too often sits on the critical path for the close cycle 
causing significant delays while operating units resolve unmatched intercompany 
transactions and balances.
Time spent at both the head office and local operations contributes to a significant 
number of man-days, which are needlessly wasted on this essential but cumber­
some process. To some extent, this is hardly surprising considering the complex­
ity of the process. In the past, the technology to support the process was highly 
manual with email and faxes forming the basis of communication between the 
counter parties to ensure intercompany balances matched. Often errors were 
only discovered during the consolidation process when intercompany elimina­
tion reports were run.
Chapter 8 of this book looks at how today’s web-based solutions, such as SAP 
Intercompany, can be implemented extremely quickly as a quick win to remove 
the intercompany process from the critical path. Significant gains can be made 
very quickly by implementing a peer-to-peer based communication process 
ensuring that intercompany balances and transactions (as shown in Figure 2.5) 
match prior to starting the consolidation process.

2.2.3
Right-First-Time Close
Errors in the financial close process are of course not just limited to errors in the 
intercompany process. There are numerous other points of failure. As Section 
1.4.2 describes, the inability of many to achieve a “right-first-time” close process 
is a critical barrier to the fast close and is a symptom of many broken or failing 
processes and systems. It’s linked to manual data entry, late delivery from report­
ing units, a lack of validation and controls, poor integration with source systems, 
and a lack of integration across multiple close processes.
As a result, taking simple steps to ensure the accuracy of data coming into the 
financial close process can have a huge impact, which is why it’s identified as a 
quick win. Later chapters in this book will examine this in much more detail, but 
a combination of using a good data integration solution that draws data from 
source systems, validates it, and loads it automatically into reporting and consol­
idation environments is extremely powerful. Chapter 3 of this book examines 
how solutions such as SAP Financial Information Management can be quickly 
implemented to deliver these capabilities in such a way that finance teams can 
own and manage this process with the additional benefit from enhanced audit 
capabilities. Chapter 7 will go on to look at how more controls can be imple­
mented to ensure additional levels of accuracy. For example, delays to the finan­
cial close process are caused not just by erroneous data (such as assets not 
equaling liabilities) but also by missing data or analysis. A common failure, for 
example, occurs when an entity forgets to include commentary explaining why a 
given number varies from a plan or budget number. The ability to check this at 
the point of submission and ensure that this information is provided before the 
process progresses too far significantly improves the speed and quality of the 
overall close process.
2.2.4
XBRL Publishing
Unlike the intercompany process, which has been around as part of the close pro­
cess from the outset and is a well-known target for quick wins, the XBRL process 
is relatively new. However, just like the intercompany process, XBRL also pre­
sents an opportunity for a quick win. XBRL is one of the biggest changes to impact 
the world of financial reporting in the past 10 years, apart from perhaps the intro­
duction of IFRS, and its use for filing financial and business information to key 
regulators, banks, and tax authorities is increasingly becoming standard practice. 

Creating an Action Plan for Improving Your Financial Close
54

Chapter 10 in this book looks in more detail at the role of XBRL in the so-called 
“last mile of finance,” the stage in the process that takes place at the end of the 
financial close, as described in Section 1.2. Typically, this stage of the process 
takes a lot of time, effort, and money, and it is often the least automated part of 
the financial close.
Although we would typically regard the implementation of a broad reporting and 
disclosure solution as a big win given the breadth of the solution coverage, it is 
possible to streamline the XBRL filing process relatively easily. Implementing a 
solution such as SAP Disclosure Management just for XBRL filing can be achieved 
quickly and without the need for extensive outsourcing of the filing process, 
which is the common alternative.
As described earlier, these are just a few examples of typical quick wins. In your 
organization, these may be different; after all, what is easy for some may be chal­
lenging for others. As with the process of defining your financial close objectives, 
it’s about reviewing your processes and identifying what works for your busi­
ness. What is clear is that using quick wins to demonstrate success and drive addi­
tional sponsorship for bigger wins is often overlooked but always valuable.
2.3
Big Wins
As we described earlier, the third stage of the action plan is to identify and deliver 
big wins. This is based on the assumption that quick wins by themselves may not 
lead you to achieve all your targets or that more often than not, you’re unable to 
implement quick wins given your current system’s landscape. Big wins require 
greater resources and more time but often enable significant reductions in the 
time the close process takes. The subsequent chapters in this book look in much 
more detail at how financial close solutions from SAP can help you address and 
implement big wins in your organizations, but for now, here are some examples 
of big wins, as detailed in Figure 2.6:
 Establishing a standard chart of accounts
 Implementing a common single instance of SAP ERP
 Implementing a broad reporting and disclosure framework
 Addressing major issues in the corporate and local close processes

2.3.1
Standard Chart of Accounts
Establishing a standard chart of accounts across the entire enterprise is a huge 
undertaking. Although this can bring many benefits, including timetable reduc­
tion, it can affect every general ledger (GL) in every subsidiary, and for many 
looking to make incremental gains, it is often considered too challenging. As a 
result, any implementation of a standard chart of accounts is more often than not 
a broader initiative than a simple fast-close project. It should be considered care­
fully and often with the aid of third-party expertise.
2.3.2
Common Single Instance of SAP ERP
Like a standard chart of accounts, the implementation of a common single in­
stance of SAP ERP may be a large project. From an SAP perspective, it’s often seen 
as the holy grail; however, while there are huge benefits of such an approach, it 
is not in itself a barrier to a fast close in our experience. Accordingly, while we of­
ten see the implementation of SAP ERP solutions as part of a financial close 
project for those looking to make incremental gains, it too is often overlooked. 
It’s more common that there is either a regional implementation of SAP ERP or a

consolidation of multiple instances into fewer regional deployments. Chapter 4
in this book addresses GL and sub-GL close processes in more detail.
2.3.3
Reporting and Disclosure Framework
As introduced in Section 2.2.4, a broad solution that addresses the last mile of 
finance can have a significant impact on your financial close process. The XBRL
component is actually the easiest part of this, which is why it is included as a 
quick win. However, even more significant gains and cost savings are possible by 
taking a broader view and developing a more established and controllable report­
ing and disclosure framework, which also has a significant impact on data quality. 
The basis for this big win is to move beyond manual, error-prone last mile of 
finance processes using Microsoft Word and Excel documents, separated from 
the secure and auditable financial reporting and consolidation systems and to 
move to implementing a full collaborative disclosure management system such as 
SAP Disclosure Management. As mentioned earlier, Chapter 10 in this book 
examines this in more detail.
2.3.4
Corporate and Entity Close
The final area of big wins relates to a broad range of solutions to common barriers 
to a fast close within the corporate and local close processes. These are classified 
as big wins because they often require the implementation of new consolidation 
software to be the foundation on which they are implemented. Existing applica­
tions are often unable to deliver suitable quick wins or to provide a sustainable 
infrastructure for the fast close in your organization.
For example, implementing new systems that facilitate the harmonizing of packs 
and processes across reporting cycles can have significant benefits. Standardizing 
on the same data flow each month helps to avoid discrepancies and reduces time­
tables because the increased volumes this standardization typically produces 
forces subsidiaries into automating processes and standardizing their own sys­
tems. The end result is often better data quality and shorter timetables. Imple­
menting a new framework will allow you to support this if your current systems 
are not able to.
Similarly, where manual data entry processes exist, replacing them with direct 
integration between source SAP ERP or GL applications and EPM applications

reduces errors. The same is true when establishing a control environment identi­
fying the most effective and efficient controls for the financial close processes and 
then streamlining and automating them to minimize the compliance burden. The 
development of a framework to monitor and control the entire close process 
from local close activities in an SAP ERP application through to final statement 
production in consolidation applications offers significant opportunities to 
improve quality and reduce the time the close takes. Subsequent chapters in this 
book address these points further and demonstrate how technology can help 
deliver these best practices.
2.4
Continuous Improvements
After you have completed the implementation of quick wins and big wins, it is 
assumed that you have met your objectives. If that is not the case, then as a 
project team, you need to decide if you have achieved enough or if additional 
steps, still under the guise of quick wins and big wins, need to be implemented. 
Even if you have met your goals and celebrated that success, your journey is not 
over. In many respects, it’s the start of a whole new one as one of the best pieces 
of advice we share with our customers is that a fast-close initiative should not be 
regarded as a one-time project. Yes, you need to establish a project and run this 
with SMART objectives over a given period of time, but the final stage of the 
project should look to establish, as part of your ongoing financial close process, a 
framework for continuous improvement.
This is critically important because as Chapter 12 in this book demonstrates, the 
only certainty we have in the world of financial reporting and regulation is that 
there will be more change to come. These changes could easily—as we have seen 
in the past with say the introduction of IFRS in Europe and the adoption of XBRL
reporting in the United States—have a profound impact on the process and sys­
tem landscapes that you ultimately design in your fast-close project.
The example of IFRS in Europe is particularly interesting. In the preceding years, 
many organizations had invested in fast-close initiatives and had made promising 
gains in terms of speed, quality, and the costs of their financial close processes. 
When it came to implementing IFRS, many applied the accounting changes and in 
doing so added more resources to the overall process. At the same time, the 
requirements compelled organizations to collect and report on more information, 

Creating an Action Plan for Improving Your Financial Close
58

and many did this by reverting to manual data collection processes often involv­
ing spreadsheets, which their earlier financial close project had sought to eradi­
cate. These manual processes took longer, were less auditable, and therefore 
extended the close process.
Being able to plan and predict such changes is of course challenging, but two key 
lessons emerge. First is that many who reverted to manual processes did so sim­
ply because they had not implemented flexible solutions, and therefore the col­
lection of the additional data was challenging. As later chapters in this book will 
demonstrate, financial close solutions such as SAP Business Planning and Consol­
idation are designed to be owned and managed by finance, giving them the flex­
ibility to change and evolve processes as requirements dictate. The second is 
more cultural in the sense that people simply lost sight of the investment and 
gains they had previously made and threw everything, including the proverbial 
kitchen sink, at the problem without looking at it in the context of the overall 
close process.
Best practice would dictate that when looking to accommodate such a change, 
you plan to do so in such a way that you further optimize the close. This requires 
more flexibility and up-front planning, but it is possible. This is why the best in 
class will typical look for post-close reviews after each close. They review the best 
in class practices and use this knowledge to coach the weaker performers. They 
use the review to spot potential issues early and adjust processes so it does not 
impact the critical path. In doing so, many businesses not only maintain the close 
times they had previously established, even in light of changing requirements, 
but further optimized them.
As Figure 2.7 illustrates, the final stage of a close project can, if the motivation is 
there, be applied to other areas of the business, such as planning, budgeting, and 
forecasting. Planning and budgeting is an area that—like the financial close—is 
often criticized for taking too long, costing too much, and often resulting in con­
flicting results. Many of the lessons from a financial close project, particularly in 
terms of the application of a similar action plan, can be used to shorten planning 
and budgeting cycles. It is also possible to create immediate benefits directly out 
of the steps you take to streamline your financial close.
One such approach relates to the use of integrated planning and consolidation 
systems. Not only do solutions such as SAP Business Planning and Consolidation
offer benefits during the close because actual and plan data exists in the same

environment, but the reporting processes, collaboration tools, and validations, 
which should all form part of a best practice close process, can be used to address 
common issues in the planning cycle as well. As part of a post-financial close 
project review process, we encourage you to think of how the lessons you learned 
within your own organization can be applied in other areas of the business.
2.5
Summary
The four-step action plan we have outlined (see Figure 2.8) is just one example of 
a number of ways in which a project team can structure a financial close project. 
There are numerous examples of actions plans out in the market as well. Accord­
ingly, you should select an approach that works for your organization because 
like much of this, there is no single right or wrong answer. However, the critical 
message is that the plan needs a structure and needs to be a managed project that 
starts with benchmarking and sponsorship, maps clear steps and actions to 
deliver against a target and objective, and prepares a culture of ongoing focus and 
improvement.

As we move through the subsequent chapters in the book, we will look in more 
detail at the functional processes within the close, including how process, people, 
and technology changes can address the barriers to a close as outlined in Chapter 1.
In particular, we will explain exactly how technology solutions and deliver best 
practices to address quick wins, such as intercompany reconciliation and close 
process monitoring, all the way through to the implementation of bigger wins 
that leverage new consolidation and reporting infrastructures.

“Garbage in, garbage out” is a saying heard often during software imple­
mentations. It is meant to convey the fact that no matter how sophisti­
cated a software system is, if you don’t load the right data in, you won’t 
get the right data out. In this chapter, we will look at how an enterprise 
can manage their data.
3
Information Management
Organizations collect data from various sources, make calculations, and then 
report results. For the purpose of the financial close, the “stuff” in Figure 3.1 and 
throughout this scenario is financial information.
This chapter discusses how organizations get information “in” and the challenges 
with managing that data. The “who” within an organization varies depending on 
how the organization is set up. Most organizations have an IT department and a 
finance department. Many organizations also have a hybrid department respon­
sible just for the finance systems. More and more as financial software is devel­
oped, it is designed to be owned and operated by the business user, not the IT 
user. The initial implementation involves both IT and finance, but the ongoing 
maintainance is owned by the finance department. This provides the finance 
department more autonomy to create the reports and processes to meet their 
needs without the dependency on IT.
Traditionally, the data required during the financial close resides in multiple het­
erogeneous source systems and general ledgers distributed throughout the enter­
prise. The financial close process usually involves combining information from 
multiple systems. These systems include general ledger systems and subledger 
systems (such as sales or human resource data). Some organizations have multiple

instances of their general ledger system and not always from the same provider. 
Often when a company has acquisitions, it will acquire legacy technology. As 
such, information needs to be moved and combined for consolidated financial 
reporting.
Because the data exists in different formats and systems, finance must depend on 
IT to aggregate and standardize the data required—a difficult, costly, and time-
consuming process that can lead to outdated reporting and analysis. Accessing, 
mapping, verifying, and loading financial information can present a serious logis­
tical challenge, often requiring manual reentry of data or the use of intermediate 
text files. These processes are not only labor intensive but can also lead to poor 
data quality and inaccurate results. And this, in turn, can cause the finance depart­
ment and its internal customers, such as line-of-business executives, to distrust 
the information they receive from IT. These challenges are compounded by the 
fact that CFOs and their teams are under increasing pressure to do the following:
 Deliver accurate, up-to-date information to support the financial closing process—
either traditional or “fast close”—and generate reliable reports and analyses.
 Integrate data across multiple applications.
 Cost-effectively meet compliance requirements and deadlines.
 Support internal customers who need data to drive their own business pro­
cesses and improve planning and decision making.
Organizations require a reliable, transparent, and repeatable financial informa­
tion management process to maximize productivity, achieve transparency, mini­
mize the cost of compliance, and increase overall confidence in their profitability 
analysis, business plans, and financial results.
Moving data from one system to another creates many challenges. If not main­
tained or implemented properly, errors can occur that hinder the financial close 
and threaten the reliability of reports and data governance. Figure 3.2 outlines 
many of the challenges faced by the CFO and, in turn, the finance department.
As the role of the CFO evolves to be more strategic, there’s an ever-growing need 
for reliable, transparent, and repeatable quality management for enterprise data 
involved in everything from master data, performance management reporting, 
and compliance to strategic business decision making. But managing financial 
information has proven to be challenging for the majority of organizations.

Defining Data and Information
63
3.1
3.1
Defining Data and Information
For the financial close, “information” includes financial data that needs to be col­
lected to create financial reports. The word “data” is extremely broad. Let’s break 
it down into two parts: Master data and transactional data.
 Master data
Master data is the essential data that describes your business and the business 
entities that your company uses, sells to, or interacts with, such as customers, 
employees, suppliers and partners, products and services, materials, locations, 
General Ledger (GL) accounts, and profit centers. Later in this chapter in Sec­
tion 3.2, we will discuss the SAP Master Data Governance solution.
 Transactional data
Transactional data records the transactions of a business. General ledger and 
subledger systems record information related to sales, accounts payables, 
accounts receivables, billing, and so on. Section 3.3 will discuss how SAP Busi­
nessObjects Financial Information Management helps you streamline this pro­
cess.

Now that we have looked at the diferent types of master data, let’s review the 
intricacies of master data management.
3.2
Master Data Management
In your enterprise, performing accurate reconciliations and group closes in a 
timely manner is important. You must efficiently support enterprise-wide com­
pliance with such regulatory standards and legal requirements as International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and various Gener­
ally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Your reports to stakeholders must 
be precise and timely.
To meet your individual requirements , the quality of your financial master data 
must be high, but to improve its quality, you must involve your stakeholders 
early in the process of reviewing master data. These goals are within reach when 
you establish a single source of truth for financial master data. The only question 
you have to worry about is: how? If your approach to financial master data man­
agement is manual or homegrown—perhaps simply a spreadsheet—maintaining 
consistent data across the enterprise and governing that data is going to be a 
problem. You more than likely experience serious impediments to good gover­
nance, although your staff works hard to create and maintain financial master 
data manually across several software landscapes and a variety of applications. 
You have no clear audit trail. Nor do you have a clearly structured change-
approval process for your financial master data. What’s more, spreadsheet-based 
and homegrown solutions usually have no process for managing time-dependent 
versions of the master data. Without an integrated approach to enterprise-wide 
data maintenance and governance, the return for your efforts will likely be the 
following:
 Inconsistent financial master data
 Manual reconciliation of data in preparation for month-end, quarterly, and 
year-end closings
 Uncertainty about the performance of your subsidiaries
 Difficulty complying with industry and government regulations

Master Data Management
65
3.2
You are not the only one wrestling with these serious setbacks. They are systemic 
to corporate accounting performed for a corporate group—comprised of multiple 
entities—when support for master data governance is lacking. Data inconsistency 
and expensive manual rework of financial data are the results you can expect. The 
SAP Master Data Governance application allows you to centrally govern the 
financial master data used in your business applications by natively integrating 
with SAP Business Suite.
3.2.1
Management of Financial Master Data in SAP Business Suite
The SAP Master Data Governance application supports financial master data gov­
ernance for usage in both SAP Business Suite software and non-SAP business 
applications. The application enables the integration of your corporate financial 
master data with your subsidiaries’ financial master data. It facilitates the cen­
trally governed maintenance of financial master data used in your corporate con­
solidation chart of accounts, general ledger accounts, cost elements, financial 
reporting structures, and organizational units—including “group companies,” 
profit centers, and cost centers. The application supports the step-by-step cre­
ation of data in a staging area, up to the automatic distribution of validated and 
approved financial master data to your subsidiaries, and it eases maintenance of 
financial master data for your subsidiaries. The software can track all changes 
made to master data through auditable governance processes that comply with 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, the application provides flexible approval 
workflows that expedite and provide control over the change-request process. It 
also supports mandatory approval processes where at least two different people 
must approve actions. The maintenance process can be set up individually to 
embrace locally and centrally executed workflow steps such as requests, approv­
als, or data entry.You can see an example of detail associated with a specific 
account in Figure 3.3.
The software can enable mappings between consolidation and operational charts 
of accounts. Using replication methods such as enterprise services and Applica­
tion Link Enabling (ALE), the software can distribute changes to other applica­
tions running throughout your company, including SAP ERP, consolidation 
applications, and non-SAP software. You can extract master data, import it into 
SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse (SAP NetWeaver BW), and upload and 
download the data to other applications.

Information Management
66

Integrated Financial Master Data Governance
The SAP software offers a number of features that automate the tasks of maintain­
ing and distributing your financial master data, integrating the data more tightly, 
and increasing data consistency across the enterprise. These features include SAP 
Business Workflow, email notifications, automated rule validations, and the Data 
Replication Framework with its configurable replication mechanisms.
Flexible Data Model
The flexible data model supported by SAP Master Data Governance allows you to 
maintain your financial data centrally. A data model for standard financial objects 
used in SAP software is included, which can be refined through enhancements 
you define to meet your organization’s specific needs.
Flexible and Robust Data Maintenance
With a user interface (UI) developed in the WebDynpro development environ­
ment, SAP Master Data Governance supports a very flexible UI model. You can 
define your own UI or extend the existing one to meet your business and end-user

preferences. With the Business Rules Framework (BRF) tool within the SAP soft­
ware, you can define business rules and build functions into the software to vali­
date data input. You can set up the appropriate authorizations to enforce security 
and workflows across your enterprise. You can perform data maintenance on an 
individual business object or on a range of objects, and maintain business objects 
within hierarchies. With the ability to view the complete structure of your finan­
cial master data, you gain much-needed visibility and can drill down into the 
detail of any particular object you want to maintain.
Time-Dependent and Period-Dependent Versioning
To manage financial data competently and produce accurate, unambiguous 
reports, you must be able to version it. You must maintain the chart of accounts 
for the first quarter and for the second quarter simultaneously without any risk of 
confusion. SAP Master Data Governance supports versioning, which allows you 
to achieve transparency of your financial data. It also supports traceability of the 
data. If your approach to financial master data management is manual or home­
grown—perhaps simply a spreadsheet—maintaining consistent data across the 
enterprise and governing that data is going to be a problem.
3.3
Transactional Data Management
In the previous section, we discussed the management of master data, so now 
let’s delve into transactional data. First we discuss how to extract data from enter­
prise resource planning systems with SAP Rapid Marts, and then how SAP Finan­
cial Information Management can help your business users to manipulate that 
data so it can be consumed by other Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) 
solutions.
3.3.1
Extracting Data from ERP Systems with SAP Rapid Marts
ERP applications contain transactional systems with complex data schemas that 
span multiple functional modules and use thousands of relational tables. Names 
used for tables and columns in your transactional systems can be cryptic, making 
it difficult to understand the data. Vendors have proprietary application program­
ming interfaces (APIs) for accessing transactional system security and business 
logic. Extracting data from these systems can be costly and time-consuming.

Information Management
68

SAP Rapid Marts packages provide powerful and flexible data integration content 
to speed implementation, lower costs, and facilitate compliance. SAP Rapid Marts 
packages enable you to leverage SAP’s domain knowledge, best practices, and 
prebuilt data models, as well as transformation logic and data extraction expertise 
for both SAP and non-SAP data sources—including Oracle applications. You also 
gain complete visibility into data lineage; for example, you can trace data back to 
its source even when integrating third-party data using connectors—and view 
transformations and applied rules. As a result, even when data comes from 
sources outside the SAP software landscape, you can see precisely what has been 
integrated.
SAP Rapid Marts address the need for fast, low-cost implementation with precon­
figured extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) functionality, database sche­
mas, semantic layers, reports, and dashboards.
SAP Rapid Marts packages accelerate access to your company’s SAP ERP data and 
yield a wide range of business and IT benefits. You can realize fast time to value 
with prepackaged solutions that get you up and running in weeks rather than 
months. The packages reduce development costs with preconfigured ETL, data­
base models, semantic layers, and reports that help reduce the load on your IT 
team and speed deployment.
3.3.2
SAP Financial Information Management
So now that you have extracted the data from the ERP system, you need to move 
the data to your Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) applications. Most 
businesses still rely on inefficient, manual, and error-prone processes to collect, 
map, and move data into their EPM software. Companies need to reduce the risk, 
cost, and effort of collecting, mapping, and loading data from systems running 
both SAP and non-SAP software directly into and between EPM solutions.
The SAP Financial Information Management application supports and enables an 
integrated process, giving you robust data collection functionality combined with 
strong finance controls, data validation, and comprehensive auditability. The 
result is quality financial data for your EPM applications, models, and reports.
Enabling Everyone to Work with Trusted Data
SAP Financial Information Management enables finance professionals to manage 
the process of accessing, mapping, and loading information from source systems 

Transactional Data Management

3.3
to EPM solutions. The application combines ease of use with functionality that 
facilitates full compliance, builds trust in the data, and helps ensure data reliabil­
ity—from source to report. All of this can be done without IT assistance. It fea­
tures strong finance controls, data validation functions, and comprehensive 
auditability, enabling everyone in your organization to work with trusted, up-to-
date data.
Simple Deployment and Intuitive Functionality
SAP Financial Information Management is designed for ease of use, enabling 
business users to set up and use repeatable, automated processes for managing 
enterprise financial data. Deployment and maintenance are simpler as well; 
because the software runs in a web browser, there’s no need for client installa­
tions on employees’ PCs. And the application can be easily distributed and main­
tained for enterprise users. The application makes it easier to access and use data; 
it shares a common “look and feel” with other SAP EPM solutions and is launched 
directly from within the applications it supports, including the following (and the 
chapters they are discussed in):
 SAP Intercompany (Chapter 8)
 SAP Financial Consolidation (Chapter 9)
 SAP Business Planning and Consolidation (Chapter 9)
 SAP Disclosure Management (Chapter 10)
Once deployed, the application provides business users with a familiar environ­
ment for managing enterprise financial data, acting as a staging room for all finan­
cial data across the enterprise.
Increased Productivity by Simplifying Data Integration
SAP Financial Information Management provides an intuitive environment for 
business users to define integration mappings and load validated data to a target 
EPM application. No manual coding is required; using an intuitive, wizard-driven 
integration interface, you simply select the source and target applications (SAP 
and non-SAP applications, as shown in the table) from a list. This interface dra­
matically simplifies and accelerates the mapping and load processes, helping busi­
ness users work faster and more effectively.

Key mapping activities supported by the software include the following:
 Simplified mapping
Select targets from automatically generated pick lists available in a spreadsheet-
like mapping area as seen in Figure 3.4. Options in pick lists are pulled directly 
from your SAP EPM solutions, and users can see only those options for which 
they have authorization.
 Mapping rules for automation
Create mapping rules to automate entry patterns, such as wildcards and com­
plex expressions. Rather than having to create and maintain countless individ­
ual rules, you can create one rule that applies to a broad set of data. The first 
row in Figure 3.4 uses the “*” wildcard so all accounts that start with 0004 in 
the source will map to E1610 as a target.
 Mapping data reuse
Reuse mapping data contained in spreadsheets to simplify the configuration of 
SAP Financial Information Management. You can copy and paste individual 
cells, columns, or entire rows or grids directly from Microsoft Excel into map­
ping tables that the software uses to translate source data into target applica­
tion data.

Transactional Data Management
71
3.3
 Multiple target-dimension mapping
Map accounts to multiple target dimensions by selecting up to six sources and 
six targets per mapping. As a result, you can dissect each general ledger 
account so that data can be mapped in a one-to-one, one to-many, or many-to-
one fashion. Figure 3.4 illustrates mapping multiple dimensions.
After you map the data, you can specify a loading option. For example, you can 
do the following:
 Replace, aggregate, or delete data that has been loaded previously.
 Run any predefined application rules or controls.
 Filter by dimension to specify data for loading to a category (such as a budget 
or actual), reporting unit, or reporting period.
Improved Accuracy and Integrity
With SAP Financial Information Management, you can improve data accuracy 
and integrity while reducing risk. Users can launch and load tasks at will and 
monitor task execution in real time to verify a quick and successful integration, 
complete with validated results for auditing purposes. In Figure 3.4, you can see 
the easy-to-use interface. By reducing the need for manual intervention, there is 
less opportunity for human error to creep into the process (a common problem 
with other approaches to data integration), which can increase complexity and 
costs.

Reliable, Repeatable, and Lower-Cost Integration
SAP Financial Information Management supports a standardized process for EPM
data integration that enables accurate, consistent, and repeatable information 
management across the enterprise. The result is easier access to trusted financial 
information—regardless of the source system or target EPM application. Due to 
the consistent integration approach the software supports, you can easily reuse 
and modify any integration process created using the application’s wizard-driven 
environment. Because users can set up new integration links themselves—with­
out the need for costly IT support each and every time they want to set up a new 
link—you can reduce integration costs substantially. Security is available so that 
you can define which users have the rights to create new mappings or to execute 
them. There is little or no requirement for writing complex integration scripts, as 
is the case with many integration applications, so there’s little need for specialist 
coding skills and costly IT support. Additionally, because the software leverages 
SAP EPM solutions as the basis for powerful functionality for ETL data, you can 
reduce your IT integration systems landscape and total cost of ownership (TCO). 
For example, depending on what you want to integrate, you can use one integra­
tion system rather than multiple solutions. This can lead to a reduction in initial 
system costs, maintenance costs, and training costs because you no longer need to 
maintain skills in multiple systems. By itself, SAP Financial Information Manage­
ment equips you to handle most integration requirements. By deploying this 
application and consolidating your integration systems to eliminate redundant 
functionality, you can potentially save software and maintenance costs.
Secure Access and Controls
From a user perspective, access to data, reports, and activities is controlled by 
role-based permissions. Your users see only what they should see, and their activ­
ities are restricted to those that support their role. In addition to working in a 
secure environment, users are directed to their activities from the point at which 
they enter the system. As a result, they do not waste time on areas or activities 
that are not relevant to their role.
Secure, Transparent Processes That Lower Costs
SAP Financial Information Management enables process transparency, resulting 
in greater clarity and confidence in integrated data, increased data accuracy, and 

Transactional Data Management

faster auditing time frames—all while lowering compliance costs. As data is 
mapped, the software automatically creates an easily accessible audit trail for 
every data move. You can capture full mapping details, including the “from” and 
“to” values with time stamps for all affected dimensions. In addition, the audit 
trail tracks all details of the launch and load task, including task name, start and 
end time stamps, user, status, and detailed task feedback. Users can see their own 
audit trails, according to their role-based permissions, complete with mapping 
and load histories. Figure 3.5 shows a job log history in Financial Information 
Management. Audit users can see the audit history of all users. But because the 
audit trail history contains sensitive information, IT users, such as administrators, 
may not be able to view audit trails. SAP customers find that the increased pro­
cess transparency enabled by SAP Financial Information Management—com­
bined with the ability to accelerate audit time frames—helps build trust and 
confidence in financial data and EPM reporting generated by all integrated appli­
cations. At the same time, the software facilitates a smooth compliance process 
while lowering associated costs.
Greater Insights Enabled by Drill-to-Origin Functionality
After data from source systems is fed into one of your SAP EPM solutions, you 
can click any consolidated number to drill back to the source data. SAP Financial 
Information Management maintains a copy of actual source data. This functional­
ity, which is enabled directly within SAP EPM solutions, is available through both 
Figure 3.5  Information Management Job Run History

Information Management

web and desktop clients. As a result, you can view the breakdown of data at a 
more detailed level, such as the subaccount level, than is stored in the SAP EPM 
solution. You can also trace an aggregate amount across all contributing loading 
tasks. For example, after doing multiple loads via aggregation, you can access the 
contributing numbers because they are stored individually in the repository 
within SAP Financial Information Management. If you run a consolidation, you 
can trace from the consolidated number back to the source contributing numbers.
Data Integrity That Reduces Risk and Builds Trust
SAP Financial Information Management performs comprehensive validations 
before data is loaded to help ensure that error-prone financial data is loaded cor­
rectly the first time. The software automatically detects invalid mappings and 
missing dimensions and performs any additional validations that you define. 
During actual loading, the integrated, target SAP EPM solution also performs data 
validation activities, such as the following:
 SAP Financial Consolidation performs intelligent checks and applies filters and 
automated rules. The application also facilitates compliance with your centrally 
defined reporting framework. See Chapter 9 for more detail.
 SAP Business Planning and Consolidation performs validation activities related 
to dimension members, access security for dimension members and tasks, 
work-state checks, audit data updates, and more. See Chapter 9 for more detail.
Integration with SAP and Non-SAP Data Sources
SAP Financial Information Management can support the connectivity needs of 
large multinational businesses with thousands of reporting entities—each with 
data scattered across dozens of different source systems—and can provide a full 
audit trail for each. SAP Financial Information Management comes with (and fully 
integrates with) SAP BusinessObjects Data Integrator software, a robust data inte­
gration tool. You can integrate directly with heterogeneous application and data­
base sources, such as your general ledger, and map data contained within them 
directly to your application. Because you no longer need to use intermediate flat 
files or manually rekey data to “move” data, the software saves time, reduces inte­
gration costs, and helps reduce the potential for human error. SAP Financial 
Information Management also supports best-practice implementations by lever­
aging predefined templates for integration and SAP Rapid Marts packages.

Summary
Financial information management is the glue that holds the financial closing pro­
cess together. Both master data and transactional data are key building blocks. 
Obtaining solutions for your organization to gain better control, transparency, 
and automation to the information management process will save your organiza­
tion both time and money and instill confidence to all that the information they 
are reporting is correct.
In the following chapters, you will go beyond the “put stuff in” part of informa­
tion management as discussed as the beginning of this chapter, to the “doing 
stuff” and “getting stuff out” parts.

Throughout a period, financial postings are made to the General Ledger. 
To ensure accurate financial statements, you need to carry out period-end 
closing activities in the Finance module to ensure the correct valuation of 
the balance sheet and P&L statement for reporting and tax purposes for a 
legal entity.This chapter will explore the General Ledger and Subledger 
Close.

The General Ledger and Subledger Close
Within SAP, two modules allow you to manage your financial transactions. The 
Financial (FI) module encompasses General Ledger transactions, as well as sub­
ledger accounting to manage additional details, including accounts payable, 
accounts receivable, and fixed assets. Financial statements, including the balance 
sheet, P&L (profit and loss) statement, and cash flow statement are created from 
within FI. In parallel, the Controlling (CO) module provides you with the ability 
to perform management accounting, which enables you to manage your business. 
Both modules are at the heart of the SAP ERP system.
In this chapter, we look at the financial close processes that are required for FI. 
Keep in mind that both the FI and CO processes are necessary for the financial 
close. FI within SAP ERP allows you to manage General Ledger accounts and jour­
nal entries, as well as subledger accounting. You can also manage balance sheet 
valuation for items such as inventory to ensure correct valuation of products, and 
consistent financial statements as part of the financial close.
Several SAP Rapid deployment solutions (RDS) include both FI and CO processes; 
for examples, refer to the “Rapid Deployment Solutions for Finance” box in this 
chapter. For further detail on the CO activities required, please refer to Chapter 5.
4.1
SAP ERP Financials Concepts
Let’s first look at the organizational elements that are available to you to support 
your various finance processes and reporting needs, and how the SAP ERP Financials

The General Ledger and Subledger Close
78

module is closely integrated with the operational capabilities within SAP ERP. We 
review the organizational hierarchy within SAP ERP and then look at the docu­
ment principle. This section closes with a customer story that demonstrates how 
these organizational elements can inform and support various finance processes.
4.1.1
The Organizational Hierarchy
At the end of a period, you need to ensure that you have a compliant closing pro­
cess for each legal entity. A legal entity is the smallest organizational unit for 
which financial statements are legally required for tax and disclosure purposes. 
Most large organizations have many legal entities; within SAP ERP Financials, the 
company code represents the legal entity.
Each company code is linked to a chart of accounts, which defines all of the Gen­
eral Ledger accounts available for posting. The same chart of accounts can be used 
for multiple company codes; if this is the case, then multiple company codes can 
be assigned to the same controlling area, as shown in Figure 4.1. The controlling 
area is the link between the FI and CO modules; allocations can be made between 
company codes in management accounting as long as the company codes are 
linked to the same controlling area.
You may be tempted to define the company code at a different level than the legal 
entity, so that you can obtain financial statements. For that purpose, other orga­
nizational elements and fields are available that allow you to both maintain your 
complete financial statements at the company code level and obtain financial 
information across business units or at lower organizational levels; a common 
example is the requirement for financial statements at a plant level. For additional 
details, see the following “Managing Financial Results for Different Levels of the 
Organization” box.

of Accounts and the Same Controlling Area

4.1
Managing Financial Results for Different Levels of the Organization
While the company code represents a legal entity, you may want to generate financial 
statements for either larger or smaller organizational units. For example, your organiza­
tion may have chosen to keep a legal entity of an acquired company separate for tax 
purposes, but you want to generate financial statements across company codes for a 
business unit or product line. Alternately, you may want to look at the financial results 
of smaller units within a company code. The following list describes these additional 
fields that are available to you to facilitate these types of reporting requirements:
 Segments
If you are using the new SAP General Ledger (please refer to “The Classic and the 
New SAP General Ledger” box in Section 4.2.4), you can use segments, which are 
commonly used to support reporting by company divisions or geographies, which is 
a requirement for several international reporting standards. To use segments, you 
must also use profit centers.
 Profit centers
Profit centers allow you to manage your business across company codes, or at lower 
levels of detail, for revenues, costs, payables and liabilities. You can also use profit 
center hierarchies for summary-level reporting. Beginning with SAP ERP 5.0, you can 
assign profit centers to a segment to support additional reporting requirements. For 
additional information about profit centers, see Chapter 5, Section 5.7.
 Business areas
Both balance sheet (materials, receivables and payables, fixed assets) and P&L state­
ment items can be assigned to business areas directly. However, you may need to 
execute additional processes; for example, when generating an invoice where differ­
ent line items are assigned to different business areas, no business areas are assigned 
to the AR entry, so you must post a transfer to correctly assign the business area. 
Also, bank postings, equity, and taxes cannot be directly assigned, so business areas 
cannot be used for legal reporting.
 Functional areas
Functional areas are designed to provide details related to the cost of sales, and they 
allow you to categorize operating expenses, such as production, sales, research and 
development, and administrative costs. Functional areas can be entered in a journal 
entry, or they can be derived from the master data of controlling objects; for more 
information about controlling objects, see Chapter 5.
4.1.2
The Document Principle
A document is created by the system to record every transactional activity that 
occurs within SAP ERP; this is true both in logistics and accounting. Examples of 

The General Ledger and Subledger Close
80
4
documents are sales orders, invoices, goods movements (into or out of inven­
tory), and journal entries.
As part of the integrated nature of SAP ERP, when a transaction is posted in logis­
tics—including in the Sales and Distribution (SD), Materials Management (MM), 
and Production Planning (PP) modules—a corresponding entry is automatically 
made to FI; for this reason, the financial account balances do not lag behind oper­
ations processes, and no reentry of financial journal entries is required. The 
appropriate accounts are configured and are typically determined from the mas­
ter data in the transaction, including the master records for materials, customers, 
vendors, and assets. In addition, from any of these documents, for example a 
sales order, all subsequent documents can be displayed, such as a goods issue, 
invoice, and journal entry, as shown in Figure 4.2. Also, if there are controlling 
objects from the CO module that are associated with the posting, for example, a 
cost center or profit center, an additional CO document is created for each con­
trolling object.
Let’s look at an example of the benefits that one customer, Cargojet Income Fund, 
achieved with the tight integration between SAP ERP Financials and the logistics 
modules of SAP ERP.

Customer Story: Cargojet Income Fund Soars to New Heights 
with Greater Financial Visibility
Founded in 2002 with a commitment to service and on-time reliability, Cargojet 
Income Fund grew rapidly to become Canada’s leading express air cargo service, 
carrying more than 750,000 pounds of payload every night. But growth soon out­
paced the capabilities of the company’s legacy business systems, and it became 
increasingly difficult to access timely financial information. As a result, the airline 
decided to help clear the runway for future growth by implementing the SAP ERP 
Financials solution.
An analysis by the SAP Value Engineering group helped quantify the specific 
business benefits that the company could expect from the new SAP solution and 
provided benchmarks for Cargojet and its implementation partner, IDS Scheer 
Canada, to aim for. Their commitment and teamwork paid off with a rapid rollout 
of financial software to support General Ledger, controlling, accounts payable, 
and accounts receivable that was completed on time and within budget.
Previously, Cargojet relied heavily on spreadsheets to report and analyze business 
data, but greater automation now provides better visibility and understanding of 
the company’s financial information with decision makers able to drill down 
through the latest data in any number of ways that make it easier to compare bud­
gets against actuals and analyze performance across different periods. Cargojet 
has also established cost centers within the company that enable individual 
department leaders to view and manage their expenses, particularly the variable 
costs that are vitally important to the airline’s financial success.
Cargojet is also seeing greater efficiency and productivity in its finance organiza­
tion with the team delivering a 50% reduction in financial closing times while the 
time required to create new reports has been slashed by up to 60%. The effort for 
internal and external audits has also been reduced, helping to lower audit costs by 
an estimated 10% to 15%. While the value engineering study makes it easier to 
assess the return on investment, Cargojet thinks these accomplishments are just 
the beginning as it considers expanding its SAP software landscape in areas such 
as HR, maintenance, and sales.
User Interfaces
In addition to the SAP GUI and the SAP NetWeaver Portal, the SAP NetWeaver Business 
Client is a new user interface that provides a unified environment to harmonize access to

The General Ledger and Subledger Close

various business applications. You can customize which information is displayed and
collapsed, and you can combine both SAP and non-SAP information on the same page,
as shown in Figure 4.3. This allows you to monitor external information, such as stock
prices of your own and competitive companies.
Figure 4.3  Customer Master Data and Transactional Overviews Combined with External Web 
Information
One available option within the SAP NetWeaver Business Client is the use of role-based 
side panels for core SAP ERP transactions. Side panels provide an easy-to-navigate 
menu that give you access to all tasks that are relevant to your role. In addition, they 
enable context-sensitive displays of additional information about an application, such as 
business graphics that illustrate data from a table or the application which is shown in 
seperate tabs (see Figure 4.4).
Figure 4.4  Context-Sensitive Business Information is Available Using Tabs.

The General Ledger Close

4.2
This capability is useful leading up to the financial close; for example, a cost center man­
ager can keep an eye on the departmental spend, and react to exceptions prior to the 
closing activities.
Now that we have reviewed some of the financial concepts that guide General 
Ledger and subledger processes, let’s walk through the different aspects of the 
financial close of your legal entity, beginning with the core General Ledger appli­
cation.
4.2
The General Ledger Close
General Ledger Accounting (FI-GL) allows you to create your chart of accounts, 
the General Ledger master records that are required for you to understand the 
financial health of your legal entity, and the financial statements for your organi­
zation.
The key master data record is the General Ledger account. First, you define the 
type of account, for example, whether it is a balance sheet or P&L account. You 
can decide whether manual posting is allowed on a particular account or whether 
posting is only done using automated processes, for example, from the logistics 
process described in Section 4.1.2. You can determine which fields are relevant 
for posting journal entries to the account; for example, for expense accounts, you 
can determine that certain accounts are used for orders and projects but not cost 
centers. In addition, you need to define whether an account is managed as an 
open item account, meaning that a clearing process must take place for each line 
item posted to the account; examples include accounts for bank postings, receiv­
ables and payables.
In this section, we look at the financial close processes that you need to carry out 
for the core General Ledger functions: posting periods, period-end journal 
entries, foreign currency valuations, and year-end close activities.
4.2.1
Posting Periods
In configuration, you set up the periods when you define your fiscal year. A 
period is usually a month. As part of the financial close, you need to open the 
next period to allow financial postings. In addition, you need to close the current 

The General Ledger and Subledger Close
84
4
period for posting, which prevents any additional financial entries from being 
made to a prior period. If you expect to make accrual entries in the prior period 
as part of your closing process, you may want to have both the prior period and 
the new, or current, period open simultaneously for a brief amount of time. 
Because posting periods can be opened and closed for account types and General 
Ledger account ranges, you can choose to close all accounts for posting in a prior 
period with the exception of those manual accrual accounts.
You can also define up to four special periods, which may also be open simulta­
neously. These special periods are typically used for year-end closing to create 
supplementary financial statements.
4.2.2
Period-End Journal Entries
There are many examples of journal entries that must be made during the finan­
cial close, such as accruals for interest or taxes, recurring expenses for rental 
costs, and deferrals of expenses for insurance premiums to allocate the cost to all 
periods even though the payment is made up front. These posting entries are 
made directly in the General Ledger, not through the integrated logistics pro­
cesses.
Figure 4.5  Automating Financial Entry Posting via Template

The General Ledger Close
85
4.2
Different methods are available for posting these journal entries:
 Manual entry
You can enter the accounting entry manually, as long as the General Ledger 
account has been set up to allow direct postings.
 Templates for recurring entries
For transactions that are carried out repeatedly, you can set each up in a tem­
plate, as shown in Figure 4.5, which you then run during the financial close.
 Accrual engine
As part of the Financials Extension (EA-FIN), you can use the accrual engine to 
calculate and post accruals automatically. A common scenario is the calculation 
of revenue recognition values, for example, when the revenue of a sale should 
be distributed over the life of a contract.
4.2.3
Foreign Currency Valuation
During the General Ledger close, if you need to create financial statements in 
multiple currencies, you must perform foreign currency valuation. You may have 
open items that need to be revalued with the month-end exchange rate to ensure 
that balances are correct. Examples include vendor invoices, customer invoices, 
and General Ledger open item accounts. The system then also makes postings to 
unrealized gain and unrealized loss accounts.
In addition, you may be managing some of your General Ledger accounts in a for­
eign currency, most commonly balance sheet accounts. For gains and losses in the 
valuation based on the exchange rate, the system makes postings to expense and 
revenue accounts to reflect exchange rate differences.
Reorganizations
There may be business situations in which you have reorganized your company, for 
example, when introducing new product lines or restructuring business units. Such reor­
ganization should be performed after a financial close so that you can start fresh in the 
new period. You may also have simply created new accounts or cost centers that you 
need to accommodate in your processes.
Many programs are available within SAP ERP Financials that help you carry out reorga­
nizations. Examples include reorganizing the segments in the new SAP General Ledger, 
changing credit limits due to new policies, and reorganizing profit and cost centers due 
to a new organizational structure. The reorganization program also makes adjusting 
entries to the General Ledger where necessary.

The General Ledger and Subledger Close

4.2.4
The Year-End Close
During the year-end close, some additional activities take place. You may have 
chosen to create additional special posting periods to manage the year-end close, 
as discussed in Section 4.2.1.
In addition, you need to run the program to carry forward the balances to the 
new fiscal year, including the balances for balance sheet accounts, and a posting 
to the retained earnings account for the P&L balances.
Finally, year-end is the best opportunity to implement business reorganizations, 
as described in the “Reorganizations” box earlier.
The Classic and the New SAP General Ledger
The General Ledger has always been the cornerstone of the FI module. With the release 
of SAP ERP 5.0, the new SAP General Ledger was introduced, which includes the fol­
lowing features that help accelerate the financial close:
 Parallel financial reporting through parallel ledgers
With the new SAP General Ledger, you can create multiple ledgers directly in the FI 
module, which allows you to create a ledger for various accounting principles, such 
as the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) and various country-specific 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) regulations. Also, standard report­
ing is available for all ledgers in the new SAP General Ledger. This effectively elimi­
nates the need for special purpose ledgers (FI-SL) to handle parallel valuations, which 
also required creation of custom reports for its ledgers.
 Balanced books by any dimension
The new SAP General Ledger enforces balanced books not only by company code but 
also by profit center, segment, and business area through a document splitting fea­
ture, which creates the appropriate balanced line items for these objects. This occurs 
when postings are made across the organizational hierarchy, for example cross-com­
pany code postings and cross-functional area postings. The classic General Ledger did 
not do this, as discussed in the “Managing Financial Results for Different Levels of the 
Organization” box.
 Integration between financial and managerial accounting
Many fields in the Controlling (CO) module are also available in the new SAP General 
Ledger. In addition, for processes such as cost center assessments, described in Chap­
ter 5, Section 5.2.6, which are only posted in the CO module, an FI document is now 
created to ensure that time-consuming reconciliations are no longer necessary.
 Easier inclusion of customer-defined fields
If you define new fields for your organization, for example, based on industry require­
ments, these can be easily picked up by the standard reporting in the new SAP Gen­
eral Ledger.

Let’s look at the story of one customer, the Automotive Group of Continental AG, 
which migrated from the classic General Ledger to the new SAP General Ledger.
4.2.5
Customer Story: Continental’s Smooth Transition with the 
SAP General Ledger Migration Service
The Automotive Group of Continental AG with its three divisions, Chassis & 
Safety, Powertrain, and Interior, is present in more than 170 locations world­
wide. Acquisitions resulted in a heterogeneous IT environment, and the company 
set about harmonizing platforms, including the financial accounting and control­
ling processes, by moving to the latest version of the SAP General Ledger applica­
tion.
Previously, individual departments within the Automotive Group had to juggle 
various versions of the SAP General Ledger solution, which both hindered timely 
reporting and made assigning costs and revenues between different profit centers 
very difficult. What’s more, different departments were using different terminol­
ogy to refer to similar or even identical processes. To address these issues, the 
company used the SAP General Ledger Migration Service delivered by the SAP 
Active Global Support (AGS) organization to migrate data from 25 software sys­
tems and 34 clients to the latest version of SAP General Ledger.
The project was carried out within an extremely tight time frame of just 6 months 
and with minimal disruption to business processes. This is particularly important 
in the automotive sector because component suppliers’ and customers’ value 
chains are precisely aligned for just-in-time delivery, so a standstill at a Continen­
tal plant would have also stopped multiple OEM production lines.
The latest version of SAP General Ledger has replaced the multitude of ledgers 
previously in use at the Automotive Group, and today 360 employees at multiple 
sites across the globe use a single version of the software. The standardized 
framework allows staff to assign costs and revenues to specific departments, 
which greatly aids reporting, and the company is one step closer to realizing its 
vision of creating a standardized, integrated financial accounting and controlling 
environment. However, Continental is not there yet. The company acknowledges 
that its new General Ledger is just the starting point, and it also needs to stan­
dardize other core financial processes such as planning and budgeting, profit-cen­
ter planning, and profitability analysis. Meanwhile, Automotive IT is looking into 

The General Ledger and Subledger Close

ordering further services from AGS, including implementing the SAP Financial 
Closing cockpit. See Chapter 6 for more detail on SAP Financial Closing cockpit.
Now let’s look at the close process for the Accounts Payable and Accounts Receiv­
able modules.
4.3
The Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable Close
Both the Accounts Receivable (FI-AR) and Accounts Payable (FI-AP) modules have 
very similar processes for the financial close. Because these General Ledger 
accounts are managed as subledger accounts, the reconciliation is done using cus­
tomer numbers for AR and vendor numbers for AP. The financial close activities 
are very similar.
AR and AP accounts are typically managed as open item accounts. Each line item 
that is posted to the account must be cleared, or offset, by another posting in the 
same account, usually for customer and vendor invoices. For example, the 
expected receivables for a customer must be offset by the actual customer pay­
ment. If these are not balanced, based on an underpayment, you need to take 
action, either by collecting the remaining amount of by writing it off.
The Accounts Payable (FI-AP) module is closely integrated with the procurement 
(MM-PUR) module. When a vendor invoice is posted, the AP subledger accounts
are automatically updated. The organizational hierarchy relevant for the procure­
ment module is primarily the procurement organization that is linked to the com­
pany code.
The Accounts Receivable (FI-AR) module is closely integrated with the SD mod­
ule. When a customer invoice is posted, the AR subledger accounts are automati­
cally updated. The organizational hierarchy relevant for the SD module is 
primarily the sales area within a company code; the sales area is a combination of 
the sales organization, distribution channel, and division that allows you to 
define your sales structure.
Within AP and AR, many of the processes discussed in Section 4.2 are also rele­
vant, such as recurring entries and foreign currency valuation. In addition, the 
reconciliation of accounts, as well as postings to correctly reflect the valuation of 
your receivables and payables, must be carried out.

The Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable Close

4.3
4.3.1
Reconciliation of Payables and Receivables Accounts
As part of the period close, you need to ensure that your financial documents are 
properly reconciled. Document reconciliation allows you to ensure that postings 
across company codes are correct and look at timing differences of postings. If 
you do find inconsistencies, these are corrected either through the automatic set­
tings of the program or by using manual journal entries. The reconciliation pro­
gram uses the Special Purpose Ledger (FI-SL). Alternately, a new intercompany 
reconciliation capability, leveraging SAP HANA, accelerates the reconciliation 
process and does not require the Special Purpose Ledger, and instead works with 
the original documents posted in the FI module.
4.3.2
Valuation of Payables and Receivables Accounts
To ensure that you have the correct balances of your payables and receivables, 
you can run several programs to help you ensure this correct valuation. These 
postings may include the following:
 Open item clearing
For both payables and receivables, while most organizations run this program 
on an ongoing basis, you should ensure that you have cleared all open items 
prior to sending any balance confirmations to your vendors and customers.
 Interest calculation
For your receivables, you can calculate interest either on the balance of the 
receivables for a customer or on the interest in arrears of overdue items only.
 Balance confirmations
For your payables and receivables, during the close, you evaluate the outstand­
ing payables for your vendors and customers, and identify any discrepancies 
between your organization’s records and the records of these business part­
ners. You may request your vendors and customers to respond to you, or you 
can send a notification with the request to contact you only if the vendor or 
customer disagrees with your balance statement.
 Reserve for bad debt
For your receivables, this program applies a percentage against open receiv­
ables and posts these to the General Ledger to adjust the expected receivables; 
this is also referred to as provisions for doubtful receivables. Different coun­
tries have their own rules as to when an open receivable can be classified this 
way.

In addition to the period-end processes, an additional step at year-end is to carry 
forward the balances of both AR and AP accounts, as shown in Figure 4.6.
4.3.3
Collections and Dispute Management
Although there is no requirement to run dunning processes at period end, it is 
common for companies to use the financial close as an opportunity to send 
reminders to customers for outstanding payments, which can be scheduled to run 
automatically based on the parameters that you define.
In addition, the extended Receivables Management capabilities allow you to man­
age credit, collections, and dispute cases; now known as Receivables Manage­
ment, these modules were formerly known as SAP Financial Supply Chain 
Management (FIN-FSCM). Although these processes can be executed throughout 
the month, your company may want to ensure that outstanding collections and 
dispute items are dealt with at the period close. On the collections side, you can 
create work lists, which are used by the finance team to contact customers who 
have outstanding receivables. On the dispute management side, you can automat­
ically create dispute cases during the close, based on open receivable items or 
based on discrepancies that arise during the processing of incoming payments.

4.3.4
Travel Management
The SAP Travel Management application (FI-TV) allows you to manage the entire 
trip lifecycle, from pre-trip approval to online booking, expense reporting, and 
reimbursement. You can consider the payment of travel expenses to employees as 
a special case of the AP process; from the expense report, you execute posting 
runs that transfer the approved expenses to accounting. Many companies sched­
ule these posting runs on a weekly basis. While there are no specific period-end 
processes required, you may have internal procedures to ensure that outstanding 
travel expenses are reimbursed before closing a period, meaning that you can 
schedule an additional posting run for the end of the period to reduce the out­
standing liabilities for travel expenses. You can also configure a workflow that 
reminds employees to submit outstanding expense reports prior to the period 
close. Next, we take a look at the financial close for your fixed assets.
4.4
Asset Accounting Close
The Asset Accounting (FI-AA) module allows you to manage your fixed assets 
such as buildings and equipment. The main organizational element for a com­
pany code is the chart of depreciation, which contains the types of depreciation 
that needs to be posted for fixed assets, including book deprecation, tax depreci­
ation, and group depreciation, and the rules that govern the calculation of each 
type of depreciation. The primary activities for the financial close are the posting 
of depreciation and the capitalization of costs incurred for an asset under con­
struction.
4.4.1
Posting Depreciation
Within asset management, every asset master record is created as part of an asset 
class, for example, production machines, buildings, real estate, and computers. 
For each asset class, you can define different default depreciation parameters, 
including the useful life of an asset and the type of depreciation, for example, 
straight-line depreciation, unit-of-production depreciation, sum-of-year method, 
and double-declining balance. Based on the depreciation method, you may 
smooth out the depreciation of the asset evenly over the course of its useful life, 
or you may have a more aggressive depreciation schedule where you depreciate

more of the asset value at the beginning of its useful life. You can run planned 
depreciation at the end of a period; if you have skipped a posting run, you can 
post unplanned depreciation, which posts the depreciation value for all skipped 
periods as well as the current period. A report of the depreciation values for the 
depreciation run, as well as the cumulative depreciation for an asset, is available, 
as shown in Figure 4.7.
The depreciation value can also be posted to management accounting, such as a 
cost center or order, which is often captured as overhead. For more information 
about cost centers, see Chapter 5, Section 5.2, and for more information about 
internal orders, see Section 5.3.
4.4.2
Assets Under Construction
The Investment Management (IM) module helps you to plan, invest, and finance 
investment projects, such as capital investments, research and development, and 
maintenance programs. Investments initially incur costs and may result in reve­
nue at a later time, but not all investment projects must be capitalized.
Specifically for fixed assets, you can use investment programs to collect costs for 
assets under construction (AUC). The IM module leverages the CO module to cap­
ture these costs. For smaller assets where you don’t need sophisticated project 
management, for example, for a piece of equipment, you can use internal orders 
Figure 4.7  Report of Depreciation Values for Fixed Assets

Asset Accounting Close
93
4.4
to collect these costs. (For more information about internal orders, see Chapter 5, 
Section 5.3.) For more complex AUCs, such as building a plant or another new 
facility, you can use the Project System (PS) module both to collect costs and to 
manage the project and its resources. (For more information about projects, see 
Chapter 5, Section 5.4.)
The costs for an AUC are collected throughout the period. During the financial 
close, the standard close processes in the respective CO module are applied. The 
difference is that a calculation takes place using results analysis, which deter­
mines how much of the costs should be capitalized to an AUC; the settlement rule 
for those internal orders and projects is to the AUC, which is an asset master cre­
ated with a specific asset class for AUCs.
4.4.3
Year-End
Because the fixed asset accounts are balance sheet accounts, additional activities 
are required during the year-end close:
 Fixed assets fiscal year change
To post asset transactions in the new fiscal year, you need to execute a fiscal 
year change within the AA module. You can still continue to post to the prior 
period as part of the financial closing process.
 Account reconciliation
This program provides a list of accounts that have differences that need to be 
reconciled for asset balances and depreciation postings.
 Opening a new approval year for investments
In a new fiscal year, a new investment program is created based on the struc­
ture of the prior year. When you then close the prior approval year, any open 
investment measures and appropriation requests are moved to the new invest­
ment program.
 Carry forward the budget for investment programs
This program allows you to carry forward any unused budget from the previ­
ous approval year.
Next, we look at ensuring the correct balance sheet valuation of your inventory.

Inventory Management
In the Inventory Management (MM-IM) module, from a financial perspective, 
you need to ensure that your inventory is valued correctly on your balance sheet. 
There are different ways that you can choose to value your inventory, and these 
can be used in combination with each other, depending on the type of material in 
question. See the “Inventory Valuation Methods” box for additional information.
Inventory Valuation Methods
You can value the units of material that you have in your inventory in the following 
ways:
 Standard cost
A standard cost is the estimated cost of labor, machine time, materials, and over­
head, typically for a semifinished or finished good. All units are valued at this stan­
dard cost, regardless of whether the actual production costs were lower or higher. 
The standard cost is developed based on manufacturing data such as routings and 
bills of material (BOMs), and the associated costs of these resources.
 Moving average
The price of material, typically commodities including raw material and supplies, is 
recalculated each time additional inventory is received and each time old inventory is 
used, so the cost in the material master can change daily. This should only be used if 
there is no need to analyze detailed variances of the materials.
 Actual costing
Many companies are looking at valuing their inventory using actual costs. The mate­
rial ledger initially values inventory at standard cost, while other costs incurred dur­
ing the period are posted to the material ledger. These additional postings are used 
to calculate a periodic unit price, which is an average price you can use to valuate the 
material stock at period-end.
 Lean accounting
As the accounting counterpart to lean manufacturing, lean accounting assigns actual 
costs to value streams and eliminates the concept of manufacturing orders. Because 
actual costs are assigned to value streams directly, there is no ability to analyze vari­
ances; instead, KPIs are defined as measurements. The most common tool for lean 
accounting in the SAP portfolio is the use of SAP Profitability and Cost Management 
(PCM) module that is part of SAP solutions for enterprise performance management 
(SAP solutions for EPM).
Many companies continue to use standard costing for their inventory valuation, but 
there is an increasing trend toward getting a view of actual costs. Although the material 
ledger provides actual costs, this is still an average cost for the period. The difference 
from moving average is that this revaluation occurs at the end of a period, not as each 
transaction is posted during the period.

Inventory Management
95
4.5
As part of the inventory valuation during the financial close, we will look at the 
goods receipt/invoice receipt clearing; inventory valuation, including work in 
process (WIP) and units in inventory; and the closing of the posting period for 
materials.
4.5.1
GR/IR Reconciliation
The goods receipt/invoice receipt (GR/IR) clearing account contains the value of 
goods that you have received but for which have not yet been invoiced, and 
invoices for goods which you have not yet received. When you receive the miss­
ing goods or invoice, the system makes an offsetting posting to the GR/IR clearing 
account.
The system does not clear the items from this account. Instead, a GR/IR program 
determines an item balance for each reconciliation account and reference, or 
assignment number. If the account has a credit balance, goods have been received 
but not invoiced; if the account has a debit balance, goods have been invoiced but 
not yet received. The program then prepares adjustment entries to ensure correct 
valuation; for example, if you have received goods into inventory but have not 
yet been completely invoiced, a debit posting is made to the GR/IR adjustment 
account with a credit to an account used to track the value of goods delivered but 
not invoiced. These postings are reversed after the close is complete and financial 
statements have been generated.
A new dashboard is available for GR/IR clearing, powered by SAP HANA, that 
provides real-time charts and calculated KPIs for GR/IR information including 
open items, account balances, mismatches in the clearing process, and drill-down 
to vendor and line item information.
4.5.2
Work in Process
Within SAP ERP Financials, the CO module is leveraged for the actual production 
process, which means that production costs for materials actually reside on the 
P&L. To ensure correct inventory valuation, you need to run a program that cal­
culates the WIP for all open production items, which you then settle, creating an 
offset posting on the P&L, and debiting the actual work in process costs to an 
inventory WIP account. For additional information, see Chapter 5, Section 5.5.1.

The General Ledger and Subledger Close

4.5.3
Inventory Valuation
Different companies vary on how often they revalue their inventory. With a more 
volatile economic environment, most companies are no longer revaluing inven­
tory on an annual basis but have moved to revaluations as often as monthly. Two 
processes are available, one using a costing run to develop a standard cost, and 
the other using the material ledger to calculate a periodic unit price.
Standard Cost
If you are using standard cost for your inventory valuation, you use the costing 
run to develop your standard costs. The costing run looks at the value of the com­
ponents in the BOM; the value of the resources in a routing, including set-up 
time, labor, and machine time; and overhead that will be allocated the product. 
The costing run calculates the estimated standard cost of the product, as shown in 
Figure 4.8. After the cost estimate has been created, the follow-on processes are 
marking, then releasing, the costing run, which then updates the standard cost in 
the material master and revalues inventory at the new standard cost.
Figure 4.8  Material Cost Estimate Using Manufacturing Master Data

Inventory Management
97
4.5
The material master also contains other price fields that you may wish to update, 
such as material prices for tax and commercial valuation. As an example, the FIFO 
(First In, First Out) calculation updates the tax price field in the material master.
Material Ledger for “Actual Costs”
The material ledger (CO-PC-ACT) allows you to come closer to actual costing by 
calculating a periodic unit price. The other benefit to the material ledger is the 
ability to manage material prices in up to three currencies and valuations.
During the period, the material in inventory is valued at standard cost. The mate­
rial ledger then leverages the costing run to calculate the periodic unit price, 
which includes the actual costs incurred during the period for a material. This 
results in the determination of the periodic unit price; this periodic unit price can 
then be used to revalue inventory at that price and is also updated in the material 
master to be the standard cost for the preliminary inventory valuation in the sub­
sequent period.
Another use case of the material ledger is to carry out an alternative valuation 
after the initial costing run, using a longer time period than one period, in order 
to smooth out seasonal variances, and to accommodate for timing differences 
such as vendors whose invoices to you are delayed.
4.5.4
Posting Periods
As part of the closing, you need to ensure that postings within MM are not made 
to prior periods. Similar to the period close described in Section 4.2.1, you need 
to close the prior period for material master postings after you have completed all 
financial close activities for materials and inventory management.
Rapid Deployment Solutions for Finance
SAP Rapid Deployment Solutions (RDS) contain a combination of preconfigured soft­
ware, plus implementation services, to help you accelerate your implementation. You 
can choose modular RDS solutions, so you can scale your implementation and maintain 
control of your scope. Several RDS solutions are available for different parts of the 
finance portfolio:
 SAP ERP Financials contains capabilities for the financial close for the FI and CO mod­
ules, including the SAP ERP Finance and Controlling rapid-deployment solution; the 

The General Ledger and Subledger Close

SAP ERP Finance and Controlling for Subsidiaries rapid-deployment solution; and the 
SAP HANA Accelerated Finance and Controlling rapid-deployment solution.
 For the SAP solutions for EPM, additional RDSs include the SAP Financial Close and 
Disclosure Management rapid-deployment solution (for more information, see Chap­
ter 9, Section 9.4.1) and the SAP HANA Profitability Analysis rapid-deployment solu­
tion (for further information, see Chapter 5, Section 5.6).
Next, let’s look at a ConAgra Foods’ story on how it leveraged two SAP rapid 
deployment solutions (RDS) for the FI and CO modules to gain value in a short 
amount of time.
4.5.5
Customer Story: ConAgra Foods Improves Financial Business 
Processes with In-Memory Computing
Omaha-based ConAgra Foods Inc. is one of North America’s leading food compa­
nies with its brands found in 97% of America’s households. The company sells 
nearly 12.3 million packages of food products each day to grocery, convenience, 
mass merchandise, and club stores as well as to a variety of well-known restau­
rants, foodservice operators, and commercial customers.
Having a large portfolio of brands and products that are sold through such a 
wide range of outlets means there is a vast of data about both material costs and 
the profitability of products, brands, and divisions that the company needs to re­
port on at period ends to prepare accurate and reliable segmented P&L reports. 
Accelerating the production of these month-end material ledger and cost and 
profitability reports would clearly expedite the financial close and provide more 
timely information for forecasting, so the company partnered with hardware 
supplier Hewlett-Packard and SAP Consulting to leverage the in-memory calcu­
lation power of SAP HANA.
Implementing the SAP HANA Profitability Analysis RDS took four weeks and 
implementing the SAP ERP Finance and Controlling RDS with SAP HANA took 8 
weeks. Both of these were considered to be low-risk projects because they bene­
fitted from a tried and tested best-practice methodology that would enhance the 
transfer of knowledge and expertise to ConAgra’s own staff, enabling them to 
extend the use of the SAP HANA platform in the future.
Today, the transfer of vast amounts of material ledger data into the SAP 
NetWeaver Business Warehouse (SAP NetWeaver BW) that previously took 7

hours has been reduced to a mere 30 minutes—effectively a 92.9% reduction—
and this helps accelerate period end closing. At the same time, detailed cost and 
profitability reports are substantially quicker and easier to access so that the 
month-end forecasting cycle has been reduced by 3 days, giving ConAgra the agil­
ity and insight it needs to make better decisions in its fast-moving business.
Shared Services for Streamlined Financial Processes
A shared services organization is an internal business unit that provides a service to 
other areas of the company. Shared services are often implemented for support of 
administrative functions, including finance, human resources, procurement, and IT, to 
name a few. For finance, you can think of this as eliminating a finance department in 
each location and consolidating that function on a global or regional basis; many global 
companies have created multiple shared service centers, each covering a different geo­
graphic area, such as the Americas, Europe, and Asia. The benefits of shared services 
include standardizing processes across the company, consistent application of policies, 
and reduced costs.
While many companies leverage SAP ERP Financials as described, a recent innovation is 
the SAP Shared Service Framework, which allows you to use the SAP CRM Interaction 
Center capabilities—but without the need to implement SAP CRM—to enable commu­
nication such as inbound and outbound call center and email capabilities, to use skill-
based routing (e.g., to route receivables questions and payroll questions to different 
teams with the appropriate expertise), to create service requests when an issue surfaces, 
and to provide self-services for employees to access information themselves.
Several predefined scenarios are available; those related to finance include the follow­
ing:
 Accounting Interaction Center
Service agents can access FI and CO module capabilities, as well as Receivables Man­
agement capabilities, including electronic bill presentment and payment (SAP Biller 
Direct), SAP Collections Management, and SAP Dispute Management.
 Travel Interaction Center
Service agents leverage SAP Travel Management, together with the Interaction Cen­
ter, to process expense reports, view credit card receipts, and update employee mas­
ter data.
For companies that have implemented a shared services organization, the financial close 
is usually processed by these shared services business units, leveraging the same core 
finance capabilities discussed here. Although there are no additional period-end pro­
cesses specific to shared services, through the SAP Shared Services Framework, an addi­
tional capability for processing at period end is the automatic creation of service 
requests based on batch jobs, for example, errors in payment runs. If you choose to run 
this process, you can ensure that the shared services organization can proactively be 
involved in the resolution of these issues.

Next, we consider reporting, which is a key element to ensuring that the pro­
cesses have been executed correctly as part of the close.
4.6
Reporting
Reporting is an integral part of the financial close. For FI, different types of 
reports are available that allow you to monitor the financial close, as well as make 
business decisions based on financial results. Reports that are available as part of 
FI include the following:
 Master data reports
These reports allow you to get a listing of the master data records in your SAP 
ERP Financials, such as a list of General Ledger accounts in your chart of 
accounts, or a listing of changes made to the General Ledger master records.
 Account balances
These reports allow you to see the balance of your General Ledger and sub­
ledger accounts at any time and break down those balances by other types of 
organizational elements, such as segments, cost centers, and profit centers, as 
shown in Figure 4.9.
 Line item reports
These reports allow you to see the individual postings made to specific 
accounts. Line item reports also include open item reports, which help you 
manage your subledger and clearing processes.
 Document reports
These reports provide information on specific journal entries and changes 
made to those entries, as well as consistency checks, for example, to highlight 
gaps in document numbers.
 Financial statement reports
These reports of the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement 
are the primary financial statements that must be produced. Options include 
comparisons of actuals to planned data, and actual comparisons across periods.
To ensure that these reports are analyzed as part of the financial close, you can 
incorporate them into the SAP Financial Closing cockpit as tasks that need to be 
executed, with instructions for the types of reviews that are necessary; for addi­
tional information, please refer to Chapter 6.

Reporting
101
4.6
In addition to the reporting available directly within SAP ERP Financials, other 
tools are available for reporting, including the SAP NetWeaver BW and the SAP 
BusinessObjects Business Intelligence (BI) tools. For additional information, 
please refer to Chapter 11.
The story of KazStroyService Group illustrates the benefits of SAP ERP Financials 
as an integrated part of SAP ERP, in combination with SAP BusinessObjects BI 
solutions, to facilitate the reporting across finance and operations that is a crucial 
aspect of each step of the financial close.
4.6.1
Customer Story: KazStroyService Group Streamlines and 
Consolidates Business Processes
When it comes to construction and logistics for oil and gas and other industries, 
KazStroyService Group (KSS) is a world-class leader. But with operations in Kaza­
khstan, India, and Turkmenistan, as well as plans to expand into other sectors 
such as roads, power plants, and ports, the company needed a single IT platform 
to consolidate and streamline crucial business and financial processes.
KSS initiated a project to install a single IT platform that would unify all group 
companies, improve operational visibility across projects, and provide accurate 
management reporting in real time by engaging with Highbar Technologies to 
upgrade to the latest version of the SAP ERP application and deploy SAP Business­
Objects BI solutions across multiple lines of business.
Using the SAP RDSs that expedite the adoption of BI for specific lines of business, 
such as sales, financial reporting, procurement, and plant maintenance, in times­
cales as short as three months meant that the project team could successfully

complete more than 40 separate rollouts spanning all 3 companies in the group 
within 11 months—and on budget.
With its portfolio of SAP solutions in place, KSS is now using a single enterprise 
platform to consolidate and streamline all business and financial processes across 
projects and subsidiaries. This has allowed the company to increase operational 
efficiency and gain better control over projects with increased productivity, accel­
erated process cycles, and reduced costs. For instance, the company estimates 
that its financial close cycles have been reduced by 60% and its procurement-to-
pay processes are an amazing 99.99% faster. At the same time, the pervasive use 
of SAP BusinessObjects BI solutions that incorporate real-time dashboards means 
managers have access to reliable and up-to-date information that enables them to 
make quicker and more informed decisions.
Meanwhile, the finance teams need considerably less time to prepare manage­
ment reports, which improves productivity and releases resources for more 
value-added analysis—something that would not have been possible without a 
unified platform based on SAP ERP and SAP BusinessObjects BI solutions.
4.7
Summary
The FI module within SAP ERP allows you to manage General Ledger accounts 
and journal entries, as well as subledger accounting, including accounts payable, 
accounts receivable, and fixed assets. You can also manage balance sheet valua­
tion for items such as inventory to ensure correct, consistent financial statements 
as part of the financial close.
In the next chapter, we show how management accounting is handled in the CO 
module, how it is tightly integrated with the FI module described here, and the 
closing activities that are necessary as part of the financial close.

103
Management accounting breaks down account-level information into 
more detail to enable managers to make better business decisions and 
plan for the future. In SAP ERP, this is handled in the Controlling (CO) 
module, which requires that additional information be incorporated into 
the financial close activities to enable management reporting and to 
ensure compliance with accounting standards. This Chapter will explore 
the financial close in controlling.
5
The Financial Close in Controlling
The balance sheets and P&L statements that are often top of mind during the 
financial closing activities do not tell the entire story. While the chart of accounts
reflects the categories that are required for external reporting, it is not the appro­
priate level of detail for managing departments or projects. This lower level of 
detail typically involves departments, which are represented by cost centers; 
projects, which are represented by work breakdown structures (WBS elements) 
and networks; simple, short-term activities, which are represented by internal 
orders; and manufacturing processes that capture the cost of producing a product 
or product line, which are represented by manufacturing cost objects.
In SAP ERP, the General Ledger (GL) accounts reside in the Finance (FI) module, 
while management accounting processes are handled within the Controlling (CO) 
module. As a result, it is not necessary to explode the number of GL accounts to 
manage the lower level of detail.
This is a different approach than many legacy systems where the chart of 
accounts—the actual GL account coding block—includes the cost center as part of 
the account number. For example, if we take the GL accounts 123 and 456, and 
cost centers AB, CD, and XY, which are allowed to post to these accounts, the cod­
ing block of these legacy chart of accounts includes both the account and the cost 
center, requiring an exponential increase in the number of GL accounts, as shown 
on the left side of Figure 5.1. It also means that each time a new cost center is cre­
ated, the updates to the master data can be very time-consuming because many 
new accounts need to be created.

The Financial Close in Controlling
104

By separating financial (FI) information from management accounting (CO) infor­
mation, the chart of accounts contains only the “pure” GL accounts. The organi­
zational entities (in this example, the cost centers) are represented by their own 
master data. In a journal entry in SAP ERP, the GL account and the cost center are 
represented by two different fields, as shown on the right side of Figure 5.1. 
Reporting in SAP ERP on the cost centers, then, does not involve reporting 
directly on the GL accounts in FI but instead on the cost centers in CO.
The Organizational Hierarchy within Controlling
The organizational hierarchy determines how costs can be moved. Unlike journal entries 
between legal entities (company codes), there are limitations within CO when the con­
trolling objects do not fall within the same top-level hierarchy:
 The operating concern is the organizational entity used in Profitability Analysis (CO-
PA). Multiple controlling areas can be assigned to an operating concern; postings 
between operating concerns are not possible.

In this chapter, we will cover the master data in the CO module that is relevant 
for the financial close processes, as well as the period-end activities that you need 
to perform.
5.1
Cost Element Accounting
Often, accountants talk about GL accounts, while the department managers speak 
about cost elements. There are two main categories of cost elements, primary and 
secondary, in Cost Element Accounting (CO-OM-CEL). We will discuss each of 
these cost element types in further detail.

5.1.1
Primary Cost Elements
A primary cost element is a master record in the CO module, which represents a 
Profit & Loss (P&L) account; this cost element uses the same account number as its 
GL counterpart. Each time a posting is made to a P&L account, the system checks 
to see whether a primary cost element exists. If so, it requires that a controlling 
object is entered. Controlling objects are master records, such as cost centers or 
projects, which provide the capability of tracking the costs associated with these 
P&L accounts on a more detailed level.
To illustrate this logic, Figure 5.3 shows an example of a manual journal entry. A 
posting is made to account 123, which has a corresponding cost element; there­
fore, the system requires a controlling object to be referenced, in this case, 
project (WBS element) XYZ. If, instead, the posting is made to account 456, there 
is no primary cost element, and no controlling object is entered.

5.1
For many financial entries, the controlling objects are entered manually during 
the creation of a journal entry. To ensure control of these postings, you can limit 
which cost elements can post to particular controlling objects; for example, costs 
related to marketing activities should not be posted to a utilities cost center.
Note that a single line item in a journal entry only posts to a single controlling 
object; if more than one controlling object is required, then you need additional 
line items in the journal entry. Each line item then includes the same primary cost 
element but a different controlling object.
5.1.2
Secondary Cost Elements
When moving costs between controlling objects, in most legacy systems, a finan­
cial journal entry would have been required, for example to allocate costs from 
one cost center to another. Within the Controlling module, costs can be moved 
between controlling objects without affecting the GL. These cost movements are 
tracked with secondary cost elements; they are essentially accounts that exist only 
in the CO module, not in FI. When costs are moved, for example to apply over­
head to a production order, a CO document is created to capture the debits and 
credits between the controlling objects.
Figure 5.4 shows a very simple example to illustrate the difference between pri­
mary and secondary cost elements. Costs are posted to cost center AB using two 
different primary cost elements, as shown in the left column, FI Documents. 
These costs are then allocated out to other cost centers; while the same secondary 
cost element could have been used for all allocations, the more common 
approach, shown in the center column, CO Documents, is to use a different sec­
ondary cost element for each primary cost element in use, so you can more easily 
trace the flow of costs across controlling objects in reporting.
From a FI module point of view, the costs still reside in the original P&L GL 
account. They were only moved within the CO module. From the point of view of 
a cost center or other controlling object, reporting must include both primary and 
secondary cost elements to ensure a complete view of all associated costs, as 
shown in the right column, Cost Center Reports.

5.1.3
Integration between Operations and Controlling
We have covered direct postings made to the CO module from journal entries and 
the movement of costs between controlling objects. Other postings originate 
from other operational processes, which automatically post to controlling objects. 
For example, fixed asset depreciation is posted to either cost centers or orders; 
payroll expenses are posted to cost centers; purchase orders are posted against 
cost centers, orders, or projects; and the costs of manufacturing a product are 
posted to orders, projects, and sales order items.
In these cases, you can configure these cost elements so that no manual postings 
are allowed. This is common for manufacturing and product costing processes, 
where you do not want manual postings to skew the results of analyzing produc­
tion costs.

5.1
In each of the other modules within SAP ERP, including Materials Management
(MM), Production Planning (PP), and Sales and Distribution (SD), as well as the 
SAP ERP Human Capital Management solution (SAP ERP HCM), configurable 
logic is available to determine the correct accounts and controlling objects. The 
most common method is to use the master records in question. For example, the 
asset master record contains both an account determination key that drives the 
postings to primary cost elements, as well as the controlling object (cost center, 
order) to which deprecation postings will be made.
The following customer story illustrates how the Korea Exchange Bank was able 
to leverage the integration of operational and finance processes to achieve signif­
icant results.
5.1.4
Customer Story: Korea Exchange Bank Benefits from 
Standardized Business Processes
Founded in 1967, Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) has pioneered both personal and 
commercial financial services with a network that includes more than 350 domes­
tic branches and 25 international locations. Like many Asian banks, KEB once 
managed with multiple systems that it had developed in-house, resulting in staff 
having to manually gather information from different systems to perform stan­
dard business operations such as budgeting and expense allocation. In addition to 
becoming a burden for the bank’s IT staff, this home-grown environment 
resulted in critical concerns over data consistency and reliability.
KEB decided that standardized and integrated solutions from SAP offered a better 
way to do business and implemented SAP ERP for operations such as enterprise-
wide budgeting, asset management, taxation, and logistics, followed by SAP Sup­
plier Relationship Management (SAP SRM) to manage the entire purchasing life­
cycle from purchase requests to asset termination to become the first major bank 
in Korea with an integrated ERP-based management system.
The SAP solutions enabled budget planning and execution to become highly effi­
cient with all of the information stored in one system, which greatly improved 
process reliability and transparency. At the same time, KEB reports 100% accu­
racy in cost accounting and improved cost traceability. And historical data is 
always available with just a few mouse clicks.

Automated operations are eliminating paper, increasing efficiency and reducing 
costs. For example, employee expenses once submitted using paper receipts are 
now handled electronically via an interface between the corporate credit card sys­
tem and SAP ERP. As a result, approval times have been cut by 90%. Other 
improvements, such as a new electronic bidding process, have helped KEB save 
about 7% in total purchasing spend in the first year alone, saving more than 
US$10 million. This improved efficiency has enabled KEB to redeploy more than 
30% of its purchasing personnel to more strategic sales positions.
Other than core banking processes, KEB estimates that it now manages up to 90% 
of its operations on SAP solutions, making it easier for staff to manage end-to-end 
processes with more accurate and consistent data.
Now that we have looked at the cost elements, let’s take a look at the different 
controlling objects, including cost centers, orders, projects, and the cost objects 
associated with product costing processes, and the period-end process that is 
required for each. We will also look at how profitability analysis and profit cen­
ters are handled as part of the financial close.
5.2
Cost Centers
Departments within an organization are typically represented by cost centers 
(CO-OM-CCA) with a responsible owner, or department head, that is responsible 
for the expenses of a specific part of the organization. Cost centers collect costs 
associated with the department; these costs are then allocated to receivers, which 
are represented either by other cost centers or other controlling objects such as 
orders and projects. As part of the financial close, you need to carry out a series 
of steps for cost centers, including posting any necessary accruals, calculating 
overhead, clearing cost centers through allocations, and calculating variances for 
cost centers. Let’s look at each of these steps in further detail.
5.2.1
Accruals
Accrual entries can be made through journal entries in FI by posting to GL 
accounts and referencing a controlling object. Alternately, you can process accru­
als for cost centers directly in CO. You can choose to use the logic for applying 
overhead costs based on actual costs posted to an individual cost center, or you 

Cost Centers
111
5.2
can create special accrual calculation cost elements to smooth out seasonal costs 
across periods.
5.2.2
Basis for Cost Center Allocations
Costs that are collected in cost centers are typically allocated to other controlling 
objects so that they can be included as part of a fully absorbed product cost, and 
they should be considered to more accurately show true profitability. Methods to 
allocate costs include the use of cost elements, activity confirmations, and statis­
tical key figures.
5.2.3
Cost Elements
Both primary and secondary cost elements that are posted to a controlling object 
can be used as a basis for allocations. If cost elements are defined at a detailed 
level, the allocation can be very specific. As an example, you may want to allocate 
overhead based on the labor costs that have been posted to the receiving control­
ling object.
5.2.4
Activity Types
An activity type is used to define an activity, or resource, that is produced by a 
cost center. For a manufacturing process, activities can be categorized as setup 
time, labor and machine time. For services such as utilities and computer access, 
an activity can be computer usage or the amount of energy produced.
Activities can be directly allocated to a receiver as they are executed, usually by 
indicating the quantity of the activity that was used, such as confirming the hours 
of labor time used in the manufacturing process based on time entry of the pro­
duction workers. This credits the sending cost center and debits the receiving 
controlling object, such as another cost center or a production order. The unit of 
measure, such as hours, is multiplied by the planned activity rate. These activity 
type postings occur throughout the period.
While activity rates are often entered manually during planning, you can also 
choose to calculate an actual activity rate at period-end based on the actual con­
sumption of the activities. Alternatively, activities can be indirectly allocated at 
period-end by defining calculation rules and weighting factors of the activity 
usage that occurred throughout the period.

5.2.5
Statistical Key Figures
Statistical key figures can also serve as an allocation basis. Some of these key fig­
ures are fixed and remain the same in subsequent periods until a change is 
entered, for example, the square footage of a plant, or the number of employees 
in a particular department. Other key figures are based on volume, which varies 
by month, such as number of orders or number of telephone minutes used.
The Logistics Information System (LIS) is available to track key figures that can 
also be used for allocations. Each type of logistics process has its own information 
system that is delivered as part of SAP ERP; examples include procurement, sales, 
inventory management, production (shop floor), plant maintenance, and quality 
management. You can analyze the performance of your logistics processes using 
the key figures in these information systems, such as the quantity of raw materi­
als or supplies that are purchased, quantity of products sold, number of returns 
processed, and so forth. In addition to being used for the analysis of logistics pro­
cesses, you can transfer the values of these key figures to the corresponding sta­
tistical key figures in the CO module to ensure consistency and reduce manual 
data entry.
5.2.6
Allocations
The primary mechanisms for allocations from a cost center are distributions and 
assessments in cases where there is no direct activity that can be confirmed. Allo­
cations are normally performed using cost center groups; for example, sales and 
marketing costs will be allocated to production cost centers for the absorption of 
overhead costs. Most organizations define a progression of allocations, for exam­
ple, from administrative cost centers to production cost centers, using cost center 
groups in the cost center hierarchy, as shown in Figure 5.5. You should ensure 
that as you define the hierarchy of allocations, you do not allocate back to a cost 
center that has already been cleared.
You can create rules for these allocations, which contain the logic of the amounts 
that will be allocated from one cost center to another. You can define a fixed 
amount that is allocated. Alternately, you can use a percentage split, by cost ele­
ment or for total amounts. And finally, you can base the allocations on postings in 
the receiver, such as statistical key figures.

Cost Centers
113
5.2
There are two types of cost center allocations: distributions and assessments. The 
main difference between them is in how the cost elements are handled for the 
period-end postings:
 Distributions use the original primary cost element that was used in the origi­
nal posting to the cost center. Secondary cost elements that were posted to the 
sending cost center cannot be allocated using distributions.
 Assessments use a secondary cost element to post allocations, for both primary 
and secondary cost elements that were posted to the sending cost center. This 
approach provides you with the maximum visibility of both incoming and out­
going posts to the cost center.
5.2.7
Variances
To effectively manage a cost center, a variance calculation provides a department 
head with the information about the difference between the actual and planned 
(or target) costs, and the overabsorption or underabsorption of costs. While some 
companies simply use a report for this analysis based on cost elements posted to 
Figure 5.5  Cost Center Hierarchy Containing Cost Center Groups Useful for Performing Allocations

The Financial Close in Controlling
114
5
the cost centers, the SAP ERP system has a variance calculation that determines 
variance categories. The variance calculation determines two types of variance 
categories, the input variances and output variances:
 The input variance calculation compares actual debits and credits to the cost 
center and to the target costs. Target costs are determined during planning, 
based on planned debits and credits, and the planned activity level.
 The output variance calculation looks at the activity allocations that took place 
during the period and compares the actual activity allocations with the target 
costs.
These calculations help cost center managers analyze the reasons for the differ­
ences. These variances can then be cleared, for example, through an assessment 
to the operating concern in the CO-PA module. Please refer to Section 5.6 for fur­
ther details on CO-PA.
Overhead Allocations for Orders and Projects
In addition to the allocations between cost centers, overhead is also applied from cost 
centers to controlling objects such as orders and projects. In addition to the direct costs 
that are attributable to a product or to a project, indirect costs are incurred that are not 
directly associated with the production process, such as sales and marketing costs, 
machine depreciation, and nonmanufacturing supplies. Because these costs cannot be 
directly associated with a particular product, allocation methods are used to distribute 
these costs based on an algorithm.
Several options enable you to allocate indirect costs to reflect a fully absorbed cost. How 
these allocations occur, and to what level of detail, directly influence the reported prof­
itability of customers, products, channels, and geographic areas. The following options 
are available:
 Allocation of overhead between controlling objects within the CO module (CO-OM), 
for example, between cost centers, or more commonly from cost centers to orders 
and projects. The method used is either a percentage of direct costs, for example, by 
expense type, or quantities, for example, of raw material issued to a production 
order. The overhead is allocated using secondary cost elements.
 The Activity-Based Costing module (CO-OM-ABC) uses master data referred to as a 
business process, which allocates resources using process drives to the receivers. 
Receivers can be any type of profitability segment, including products, customers, 
and sales channels.
 Allocation can be settled from the cost centers directly to profitability segments 
within the Profitability Analysis (CO-PA) module at a higher level, for example, to a 
product line. A top-down allocation can then take place within the CO-PA module. 

Internal Orders
115
5.3
In cost-based profitability analysis, these allocations remain within the CO-PA mod­
ule and are not reflected in the GL.
 As part of the SAP solutions for enterprise performance management (SAP solutions 
for EPM), the SAP Profitability and Cost Management (SAP PCM) application uses 
cost drivers to perform these top-level allocations, which can also be used for both 
activity-based costing as well as lean accounting. The cost drivers are set up directly 
within SAP PCM; this is a standalone application that is separate from SAP ERP, 
which enables more flexible modeling and allows data to be easily incorporated from 
both SAP systems and non-SAP systems.
Next, we will take a look at the period-end processes necessary for the different 
types of controlling objects that typically receive overhead allocations from cost 
centers, as well as the most common usage of each controlling object.
For each of these controlling objects, the calculation and posting of overhead 
described in the “Overhead Calculations for Orders and Projects” box is the first 
step. The posting of overhead is performed using secondary cost elements. The 
processes described next assume that overhead is allocated directly within the CO 
module and not using the other profitability solutions described in the “Overhead 
Allocations for Orders and Projects” box.
5.3
Internal Orders
Costs often need to be tracked at a lower level of detail than that of a department. 
This is the case for special projects where more detailed control is necessary, for 
example, a capital investment such as new equipment for a production line. Alter­
natively, multiple departments may collaborate on projects, such as a trade show 
or a research project, so the costs should not be tracked by a single cost center. 
You can also use an internal order to track more detailed overhead costs, such as 
maintenance or utilities.
Internal orders (CO-OM-OPA) are used to capture such costs primarily when the 
task is not complex. Throughout the period, you post costs directly to the internal 
order, either through a direct posting of a primary cost element, or by confirming 
an activity that results in a posting through a secondary cost element. Figure 5.6
shows the balance of an example internal order.

The Financial Close in Controlling
116

During the financial close, you can apply overhead to the internal order from one 
or more cost centers (please refer to the “Overhead Allocations for Orders and 
Projects” box in Section 5.2.7). After all costs have been applied to the internal 
order, it is settled to one or more receivers (please refer to the “Settlement” box 
in Section 5.5.2 ). Again, it is important to map out the progression of the settle­
ment, so that a settlement does not occur to an internal order that has already 
been cleared.
5.4
Project Systems
For large-scale projects, as well as for smaller projects that require additional 
planning activities in addition to cost collection, you can use the Project System 
module (PS) to include logistics and timeline planning to help you with your 
project management. Examples of more complex projects include engineer-to-
order projects such as the design and build of a new airplane, and investment 
projects such as the construction of a new building that will be capitalized. For 
more information on the valuation of investment projects, please refer to Chapter 4,
Section 4.4.2.
Figure 5.6  Costs Posted to the Internal Order throughout the Period

Project Systems
117
5.4
The following types of master data used to represent projects allow you to man­
age project revenues, costs, and resources:
 WBS (work breakdown structure) elements represent the hierarchical structure 
of your project’s phases. You can designate which WBS elements are used for 
collecting costs, which WBS elements act as summary nodes that may or may 
not allow a direct posting, and which WBS elements allow billing and postings 
of revenue. Figure 5.7 shows a graphical representation of a project; from this 
view, you can drill down into the project master data to see additional details.
 Networks control the individual activities and resource assignments of a 
project. The use of networks is optional; you can think of them as more sophis­
ticated production orders, which give you the ability to link to activities in 
other networks for particular tasks. Figure 5.8 shows a list view of how net­
work activities are linked to WBS elements. The use of resources is posted 
directly to the networks as you execute these tasks.

After any relevant overhead application to the project (please refer to the “Over­
head Allocations for Orders and Projects” box in Section 5.2.7), a results analysis 
calculation takes place to determine the value of the project. A project is typically 
open across several periods, so a financial close process is necessary to ensure that 
the revenues and costs that have been posted to the project are recognized cor­
rectly in the GL.
You need to choose the type of results analysis calculation that most accurately 
values the work in process (WIP) for each project.The different types of results 
analysis are:
 Revenue-based results analysis
The system uses planned and actual revenues of the project to determine the 
associated cost of sales that should be posted. If the actual expenses incurred 
are higher than what should be recognized as the cost of goods sold (COGS), as 
is often the case in the early stages of a project, a posting is made to WIP for the 
difference.
Figure 5.8  A Project Overview with both WBS Elements and Networks

Product Costing
119
5.5
 Percent of completion results analysis
The system determines the completion of the project by comparing the 
planned and actual costs of the project. The revenue that needs to be recog­
nized on that basis is calculated based on the percentage of completion of the 
project. For projects in which there is a significant cost overrun, it may be the 
case that more revenue must be recognized than has been billed.
Remember that the costs posted to a project reside on the P&L. The results analy­
sis process stores the calculated values using a special type of cost element, 
referred to as results analysis cost elements. The settlement process (please refer 
to the “Settlement” box in Section 5.5.2) then posts these calculated values back 
to balance sheet GL accounts, such as WIP and deferred revenue, which ensures 
compliance with financial accounting regulations.
5.5
Product Costing
In SAP ERP, the cost to manufacture products is managed on the P&L in product 
costing (CO-PC), to leverage the CO module. This approach differs from most leg­
acy systems, where costs associated with manufacturing a product remain on the 
balance sheet, moving from the raw material account into a WIP account, and 
from there into the finished goods inventory account; only the variances are writ­
ten off on the P&L. Because the approach in product costing is different in SAP 
ERP, you need to execute closing processes to ensure correct valuation of inven­
tory and WIP.
From an inventory valuation perspective, many organizations use standard cost­
ing, meaning that for each product, the standard cost is calculated based on the 
value of the expected resources required to manufacture a product. If the actual 
production process takes additional, or fewer, resources, these values are written 
off as variances. For information about inventory valuation with a costing run 
and using actual costing with the material ledger, please refer to Chapter 4, Sec­
tion 4.5.3.
Cost objects are used to collect the costs associated with producing a finished 
good. Different cost objects are used based on the type of manufacturing pro­
cesses used. These include production orders for discrete manufacturing; produc­
tion cost collectors and the cost object hierarchy for repetitive manufacturing; 
process orders for process manufacturing; production orders and sales order 

The Financial Close in Controlling

items for make-to-order and assemble-to-order manufacturing; and projects for 
engineer-to-order manufacturing.
Whenever a posting is made in the Production Planning (PP) module, a posting is 
made in FI and CO at the same time, referencing the appropriate cost object. 
Direct costs include resources, such as the raw or semi-finished materials needed 
for the manufacturing process, as well as activities, including setup, labor and 
machine time. Each of these resources is tracked using cost elements, as shown in 
Figure 5.9.
At period-end, overhead is applied to these cost objects (refer to the “Overhead 
Allocations for Orders and Projects” box in Section 5.2.7). Subsequently, a series 
of processes must be run on the cost objects, including the calculation of WIP and 
variances, and posting those values through a settlement process (please refer to 
the “Settlement” box in Section 5.5.2). These processes are run typically while 
Figure 5.9  Target and Actual Costs on a Production Order Shown by Cost Element

Product Costing
121
5.5
production work is still ongoing; for the values in the GL to remain as clean as 
possible, the WIP and variance calculations should be run immediately after one 
another.
5.5.1
Work in Process
If a cost object is still open at the end of a period—meaning that production for 
the entire quantity is not yet complete—the production costs still reside on the 
P&L. The system calculates the work in process (WIP) to determine the balance on 
the cost objects: all costs debited to the cost collector, minus all costs credited 
which is the standard cost of all completed finished goods. A special type of cost 
element, called a results analysis (RA) cost element, tracks the WIP amounts. If 
WIP was calculated for a cost object in a prior period, and the cost object is still 
open, then any additional WIP that should be posted is calculated. If WIP was cal­
culated in a prior period, but the manufacturing process is complete and the cost 
object is closed, the WIP amount that needs to be canceled is calculated. The WIP 
values will be posted to the balance sheet, with an offsetting entry on the P&L, 
when you run settlement on the cost objects.
5.5.2
Variances
Variances are the difference between the standard cost of the finished products 
and the actual costs posted to the cost objects. These costs still reside in the vari­
ous cost elements on the P&L. Variances can be analyzed by comparing the actual 
costs on a cost collector with the target costs, which are the planned costs (typi­
cally the standard cost of a finished product) multiplied by the quantity that was 
expected to be manufactured. This calculation categorizes the variances so that 
you can perform further analysis on your manufacturing processes, including 
input variances, output variances, and scrap:
 Input variances are caused by the differences in the price and quantity of the 
materials (such as raw materials) and resources (represented by activity types) 
that were used during production.
 Output variances are caused by a difference in the quantity of products that 
were manufactured or a difference in the valuation of the completed products 
due to a change in the standard cost. A remaining variance, which cannot be 
assigned to another category, is also classified as an output variance.

The Financial Close in Controlling
122
5
 Scrap variances result from scrap due to a lack of quality. For some products, a 
planned scrap value is expected due to the manufacturing process.
These variance calculations help production managers analyze the reasons for the 
differences and can also be used as input when it is time to create a new standard 
cost for materials that are being produced. Please refer to Chapter 4, Section 4.5.3
for more details.
The variances are posted during settlement; one account offsets the P&L accounts 
in which the resource costs are consumed during production, while the other side 
of the posting is to the actual variance account on the P&L. If you are using CO-
PA, the variances can also be posted to the operating concern. For further details, 
please refer to Section 5.6.
Settlement
The concept of a settlement is the same throughout the CO module for all types of 
orders (sales order items, cost objects in product costing, internal orders) as well as for 
projects (both for WBS elements and networks). Note that cost centers are an exception 
to the use of settlement; instead, they use the allocation methods of distributions and 
assessments.
Settlement is the mechanism used to post the values calculated in previous steps—RA, 
WIP, and variances—to the GL. Settlement can occur from one controlling object to 
one, or multiple, receivers. Specific scenarios include the following:
 Clear, or zero out, the expenses (and revenues, where applicable) of specific control­
ling objects. If you have chosen to use a fully absorbed product cost, all costs col­
lected in the CO module will be allocated to a product eventually.
 Within product costing for make-to-stock and repetitive manufacturing processes, 
the settlement rule refers to the finished product that is being manufactured to pro­
cess the goods receipt. During settlement, any previously calculated WIP and vari­
ances are posted to the GL accounts. For make-to-order and engineer-to-order sce­
narios, the settlement receiver is the sales order item or project through which the 
configuration specifications were captured.
 For capital investments, whether managed with an internal order or a project, the 
settlement is to a fixed asset to ensure proper capitalization.
In designing the progression of settlement between controlling objects, you need to 
ensure that you do not settle to a controlling object that has already been cleared, as 
this will result in inconsistencies.
While settlement is normally the last step of the financial close for a controlling object, 
settlement does not prevent future postings to the controlling objects. Settlement can 
be run at any time, not only during the close process; each time, only the changes are 
posted, ensuring that entries are not double-posted.

Product Costing
123
5.5
If you have activated cost-based Profitability Analysis (CO-PA), the last step in your pro­
gression is a settlement to a profitability segment within the operating concern.
Let’s look at how a customer, Qingdao TKS Sealing Industry, was able to leverage 
the tight integration between the logistics and financial modules, including the 
link between production and product costing, in SAP ERP.
5.5.3
Customer Story: Qingdao TKS Sealing Industry Achieves 
Transparent Reporting
As its product range grew, Qingdao TKS Sealing Industry Co. Ltd., (TKS), a well-
established manufacturer of oil seals and other components used in automobiles, 
locomotives, machinery, and domestic appliances, needed to break down its 
monolithic organization into divisions and departments. Despite years of good 
service, its legacy software was unable to provide these newly autonomous busi­
ness units with the unified finance management functionality that would help 
managers drive competitiveness and improve their results. Particular issues that 
needed to be addressed were optimizing the size of inventories that had escalated 
with a growing product line, improving cash flow that suffered from production 
being out of step with orders, and increasing the accuracy of costing products.
After assessing the products of a number of well-known software vendors, TKS 
selected the SAP Business Suite and selected Neusoft Group as its implementation 
partner while educating staff and skillfully positioning its most effective people 
into appropriate positions to support the implementation.
The project progressed rapidly, and the first sets of monthly accounts and opera­
tional reports were produced to schedule after seven months. The reports gave all 
of the divisions and departments within TKS complete transparency into their 
businesses covering areas such as financial accounting, cost control, production 
planning and control, procurement and inventory management, sales and distri­
bution, and quality management in operations.
After several months of operation, the benefits of running SAP ERP became 
increasingly evident, and TKS was able to strengthen its supervision and control 
of finances in all aspects of its business as well as dramatically improve financial 
planning and analysis. More accurate cost analysis has both reduced operating 
costs and enabled more accurate internal transfer pricing while improved lean 

The Financial Close in Controlling

manufacturing has reduced both inventory and occupancy costs while improving 
customer satisfaction.
Although TKS now has the information needed to support effective decision mak­
ing, there is still work to be done to achieve full IT transformation with the com­
pany expanding its range of SAP applications into areas such as manufacturing 
and human resources.
5.5.4
The Material Ledger
For the controlling processes that we addressed in this chapter, the assumption is 
that materials being produced are valued at a standard cost. However, some com­
panies prefer to use actual costing or need to manage multiple valuations of prod­
ucts or multiple currencies. The material ledger provides you with this capability 
and can be used for the revaluation of materials that affect the balance sheet 
accounts. For further details, please refer to Chapter 4, Section 4.5.3.
Now that we have looked at the controlling objects used for collecting costs, let’s 
turn our attention to how these costs are associated with revenues to determine 
profitability and margins.
5.6
Profitability Analysis
The Profitability Analysis (CO-PA) module allows organizations to measure their 
profitability based on business segments, which includes products and product 
lines, customers and customer groups, geographies, and channels. You create the 
operating concern by defining the business segments that you want to measure, 
as well as the values that are relevant for analyzing profitability. You then create 
reports; the system provides the capability to allow you to dynamically drill down 
from the summary level down to lower levels of detail, as well as switching the 
order of fields in a report. For example, you may look at all customers and drill 
down to the products they purchased; you can then flip the order and look at all 
products and drill down to all customers who purchased each product. For the 
CO-PA module, reporting is available from within SAP ERP, as shown in Figure 
5.10, or through SAP NetWeaver BW InfoCubes.

Profitability Analysis
125
5.6
An operating concern can be cost-based, account-based, or both:
 Cost-based CO-PA is used for cost of sales accounting, in which the costs are 
matched to the revenues that were booked in a particular period. Value fields 
are used to capture this information; these value fields can be mapped to cost 
elements, but they can also be defined at lower levels of detail, for example, 
the fixed and variable components of the same cost element.
 Account-based CO-PA is used for period accounting and allows an organization 
to easily reconcile the values in the CO-PA module with the values in the GL. 
Some accounts, such as balance sheet accounts that should be captured in 
account-based CO-PA, can be defined as statistical cost elements to enable a 
posting for reporting purposes but without moving costs into a true controlling 
object, in this case a business segment.
Values flow into the operating concern throughout the period. For example, 
information from sales orders and invoices is captured, which includes informa­
tion about the customer, products sold, and channel. Additional rules can be set 
up to group products, customers, and regions for a summarized analysis. Postings 
can also be made to a business segment with journal entries.

At period-end, costs are typically posted to an operating concern through the 
closing activities of the other controlling objects. For information that comes 
from sales and manufacturing processes, these postings are made at the stock 
keeping unit (SKU) level. For postings that originate from cost centers, orders, 
and projects, many organizations choose to allocate to a business segment at a 
higher level. For example, marketing costs are often posted to a region, so you 
can then use the top-down distribution capability to allocate down to a lower 
level, such a to a sales office, from where these costs are in turn distributed down 
to products. This distribution can be based on either planned or actual data that 
has already been posted within the CO-PA module. This allocation is reflected in 
reporting only in the operating concern and is not posted back to the GL.
SAP CO-PA Accelerator
The information in the CO-PA module allows you to generate detailed financial reports 
and to make decisions about the product mix in various regions, sales, and pricing. The 
faster that CO-PA reports run and the more data that is included in the reports, the 
more valuable the results to enable real-time decision making. To support such detailed 
decisions, the volume of data becomes very high. Traditionally, organizations needed to 
schedule batch runs overnight to enable better reporting performance the next morn­
ing. With the SAP CO-PA Accelerator, powered by SAP HANA, the CO-PA allocation 
and reporting capabilities leverage in-memory computing, enabling faster top-down 
allocations during the close, as well as real-time access to information, both through 
predefined profitability reports as well as ad hoc analysis and what-if analyses. From 
SAP’s own implementation, an analysis involving 85 million records was accelerated 
from over 1 hour to less than 30 seconds.

Customer Story: Promivi, a Leader in Animal Nutrition, Utilizes 
SAP HANA and Gains Profitability and Growth Insight
To sustain its growth, Rotterdam-based Provimi Holdings, a leader in animal 
feeds and nutrition solutions, transformed itself into a real-time organization by 
using the in-memory capabilities of the SAP HANA platform to power the existing 
investment in the SAP Business Suite, which was already deployed in the 26 
countries across 4 continents where the company operates.
Increasing the performance of reporting was a priority, and Provimi can now 
mine a wealth of consistent operational data to gain new business-relevant 
insight in fractions of a second. Using a Rapid Deployment Solution (RDS) that 

Profit Centers

5.7
enabled the implementation to be complete within 3 weeks with minimal disrup­
tion, the company accelerated the speed of its Controlling and Profitability Anal­
ysis (CO-PA) and operational reporting by a factor of 15,000. In addition to giving 
business users immediate insight into the financial performance of products, cus­
tomers, brands, and territories through interactive analytics, the ability to run 
core financial reports much faster has also reduced the cycle times for repetitive 
financial processes so that the finance team anticipates a 40% reduction in the 
time taken to complete a month-end close.
But in addition to these improvement in operational productivity that have 
resulted in some incremental cost savings, Promivi has enjoyed very real financial 
benefits with the rapid insight into business performance helping to identify an 
opportunity to reduce working capital by half a million euros within the first 
week of going live.
Rogier Jacobs, CIO of Provimi Holdings, talks about “3-3-3 for SAP HANA” 
because it only took the implementation team 3 days to successfully complete a 
proof of concept using their CO-PA data; they were live and running in 3 weeks; 
and now it only takes 3 seconds to run any CO-PA analysis.
5.7
Profit Centers
Profit centers allow you to analyze internal costs according to business units and 
organizational responsibility. Profit Center Accounting (EC-PCA), part of Enter­
prise Controlling (EC) within SAP ERP, is an account-based method of looking at 
profit from an organizational standpoint, independent of the legal entity struc­
ture.
PCA is integrated with the CO module through a linkage of the profit center hier­
archy to the controlling area. Many master records—including cost centers, 
projects, orders, material masters, and fixed assets—can be mapped to profit cen­
ters to ensure postings that include these master records will also reference a 
profit center. Certain balance sheet accounts—payables, receivables, inventory, 
and assets—can also be analyzed from a profit center perspective.
By default, PCA uses the period accounting method, in which profitability is 
based on the revenues and expenses incurred during a particular period. It can 

The Financial Close in Controlling
128
5
also support cost of sales accounting, meaning the COGS is recognized only in the 
period in which the corresponding revenues are recognized.
For PCA, you need to generate an opening balance for those balance sheet 
accounts that you want to analyze, which determines the balance for the profit 
center according to profit center assignments in master and transactional records. 
Examples include receivables, payables, inventory, and assets.
Although there are special cases in which closing activities should be carried out, 
for the most part, PCA benefits from the closing activities in other modules. For 
example, cost center distributions and assessments are already reflected for profit 
centers. You may need to run the allocation process directly in PCA in cases 
where a profit center has been defined to collect costs instead of a cost center, for 
example, for services.
When using the classic GL, if you choose to post balance sheet items to profit cen­
ters directly in transactions throughout a period, you need to carry the balances 
in the accounts forward for the profit centers, again for example for receivables, 
payables, fixed assets, and inventory accounts. Also, when reporting at higher 
levels in the profit center hierarchy, consolidation processes should be carried 
out to ensure accurate data.
When using the new SAP GL, because it is already integrated with PCA, you will 
not need to take the extra steps of posting balances for inventory accounts. You 
can also leverage the additional benefit of being able to generate financial state­
ments on the profit center dimension. For further information about the SAP GL, 
please refer to Chapter 4, Section 4.2.4.
Now that we have covered the period-end processes, let’s take a look at additional 
processes that are required at the end of the year.
5.8
Year-End Closing
At the end of the fiscal year, after the normal period-end close is complete, you 
need to perform additional activities. These activities include carrying forward 
commitments to the new fiscal year, which you need to perform for cost centers, 
internal orders, and projects. Also, for internal orders and projects, you need to 
carry forward budgets. Finally, you need to carry forward profit center balances 
to the new fiscal year.

Summary
129
5.10
The other controlling objects covered do not require additional steps to be carried 
out for the year-end close.
5.9
Reconciliation Between the FI and CO Modules
With the differentiation between financial and management accounting, you 
need to ensure that you reconcile postings that occur across organizational enti­
ties. For example, often more than one company code is linked to a controlling 
area. If an allocation takes place within the controlling area but cuts across differ­
ent company codes, a reconciliation posting to the FI module is necessary. The 
same is true of allocations across business areas and functional areas.
If you are using the classic GL, these types of postings are captured in the recon­
ciliation ledger. You can show a report of the required postings, and then use an 
automated program, which posts the reconciliation entries back to the financial 
module using reconciliation accounts that you create for this purpose.
If you are using the new SAP GL, the use of the reconciliation ledger is no longer 
necessary. Each time a cross-organizational allocation is made, for example, 
between profit centers, a financial posting is automatically created. For further 
information, please refer to Chapter 4, Section 4.2.4.
5.10
Summary
The Controlling (CO) module within SAP ERP allows you to manage cost centers, 
projects, and orders, which reflect a lower level of detail than in the chart of 
accounts. This module is designed to capture the details behind accounts in the 
P&L statement. The financial close processes for management accounting allows 
you to process both direct and indirect costs and allocations, and ensures the cor­
rect valuation of products, projects, orders and profitability segments.
In the next chapter, we will look at the process for governing the close for a legal 
entity, or company code. The SAP Financial Closing cockpit provides one place to 
control the close, for both financial and management accounting processes.


131
Managing the legal entity close means ensuring that each step is carried 
out successfully and that all steps are executed in the correct order. The 
SAP Financial Closing cockpit manages the entire close process for the 
entities of a group across both finance and operations tasks. This chapter 
will review the management of the entity close.
6
Entity Close Management
The first financial close activity that you need to process is the entity close. Each 
entity within an organization needs to close their books and this involves many 
steps and often multiple people. Often different parts of an organization will 
manage subsets of the close, for example by division or by geographical location. 
For statutory purposes, each legal entity must close their books. A legal entity is 
represented by the company code within SAP ERP Financials. But regardless if 
you have and SAP ERP or any other general ledger system, you must close down 
to the entity level.
Typical closing cycles for an entity involve time-consuming manual tasks, such as 
journal entries, accruals, reconciliations, and the gathering of financial data from 
across different systems. These manual tasks are often interspersed between auto­
mated system jobs that must be run before the next task can be carried out. In 
larger companies, the closing cycle can be even more complicated because the 
work of numerous people must be coordinated across different subsidiaries, divi­
sions, time zones, and software systems. Each closing task must be performed 
correctly and in the proper sequence; otherwise, you may encounter delays in 
your closing process.
In most companies, the progress of the close is monitored by using spreadsheets, 
which rely on manual updates to maintain the status. Maintaining spreadsheets 
manually introduces risk in the process such as people not working on the proper 
version. Also, spreadsheets are not able to assist in either collaboration between 
teams or in automating the scheduling and monitoring of a system transaction or 
program.

The SAP Financial Closing cockpit application allows you to leverage best prac­
tices across your organization to define a standard close process, manage both 
manual and system tasks, enable collaboration between team members, automate 
batch jobs, and monitor the progress of the entity close. The application can be 
installed either alongside SAP ERP or stand-alone on SAP NetWeaver. It can be 
accessed from the SAP graphical user interface (GUI), or through a web-based 
user interface (UI) using either the SAP NetWeaver Portal or the SAP NetWeaver 
Business Client. The SAP Financial Closing cockpit also enables you to work 
across multiple SAP ERP or SAP R/3 backend systems, other SAP systems (includ­
ing SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse), and non-SAP systems, eliminating the 
need to log in to multiple systems to complete the legal entity close.
Each task in the template is given a date and time relative to the close date. So cer­
tain tasks will happen on the day before the close or two days after. Therefore 
when you create the actual task list off of the template you enter the actual close 
date, May 31st for example, and each task is assigned the actual date based off the 
template. Let’s look at how this application can help you plan and execute your 
financial close tasks, and monitor the results of the close.
6.1
Plan and Prepare the Entity Close
To standardize the financial close across your organization, you first create tem­
plates that contain the tasks, in order, that need to be executed as part of the 
financial close (see Figure 6.1). The tasks are typically sorted based on the organi­
zational hierarchy, including company code, plant or controlling area (for addi­
tional information, refer to Chapter 4, Section 4.1.1). Since each task has a date 
and time associated with it as mentioned, you can also organize your tasks by 
time.
You may have differences in your close tasks depending on the timing, such as 
year end, quarter end, and period end, or depending on regional differences, for 
example, to handle local tax processes or to handle a plant close for different 
types of manufacturing methods. You can choose to create multiple templates, or 
you can create one template to handle multiple types of closing cycles. If you 
choose to use one template, you can flag each task to designate to which closing 
type it belongs.

Plan and Prepare the Entity Close
133
6.1
You can create different types of tasks within a template, including the following:
 Notes to document instructions for manual tasks outside of any system or for 
sign-off tasks.
 Calling up a transaction that needs to be executed, such as opening the next 
period for posting or posting journal entries for accruals.
 Calling up programs that you want to run online, such as a balance sheet report
 Batch jobs including passing over of values of standard and customer-definable 
variables from SAP Financial Closing cockpit to the native SAP scheduler, such 
as fixed asset depreciation—a huge gain in efficiency and quality by reducing 
the maintenance effort for variants
 Process flows that include dependencies between programs and system jobs, 
for example, in product costing where the sequence of calculating work in pro­
cess (WIP), then calculating variances, then a settlement run for posting the 
results to the appropriate accounts must be maintained.
As discussed, you can create templates for different periods, different entities or 
different locations, but also deal with diversity within the same template. Not 
only does this help you manage your tasks but it also allows you to share best 
practices across the organization. Templates are easy to maintain and you can 
share task groups across different templates.

You can also create tasks using the SAP Central Process Scheduling application by 
Redwood. For additional information about scheduling automated jobs, see the 
“Scheduling Automated Financial Close Tasks” box in the following section.
6.2
Execute the Entity Close
When you are ready to begin the close, you then choose the appropriate template 
that contains the tasks that are required. As mentioned at the end of the first sec­
tion in this chapter, each task in a template has a date and time associated with it 
relative to the actual close date. The system will track both the planned and actual 
start and end date and time of a task. At any time in the close, you can see the sta­
tus of each task, as shown in Figure 6.2, as well as any dependencies between the 
tasks. You can set up event based close such that whenever all predecessor tasks 
are done, either the user of the next manual task is notified or the automatic task 
is started immediately.
You can also define alerts that are sent to enable better collaboration and facilitate 
a faster close. These alerts can be sent to proactively inform a task owner when 
there is an issue with a particular task, such as errors that occurred in a scheduled 
program or as an indication that an automated system job has completed and that 
it is time for a manual step to be executed. Notifications can also be very useful to 
inform about delays.

SAP Central Process Scheduling by Redwood (SAP CPS)
The SAP Central Process Scheduling application by Redwood is a partner solution that 
has been tightly integrated in the SAP Financial Closing cockpit to automate enterprise 
process management. Via the SAP Financial Closing cockpit, you define system jobs that 
need to be run as part of the financial close, schedule their execution, and monitor the 
results.
As for other tasks, you can indicate the start time and the parameters for running each 
job. In addition, the application allows you to define process chains and pass parameters 
from one process step to another, such as identify reconciliation accounts with balance 
unequal zero, create correction postings via batch input, and reversal postings into the 
next period.
For each job, you can see both the parameters and the results of the job run within the 
SAP Financial Closing cockpit, as shown in Figure 6.3.
Figure 6.3  Results of the Execution of Automated System Jobs Viewed within the 
SAP Financial Closing cockpit
In addition to the straight-forward scheduling of jobs, you can also use conditional pro­
cess intelligence to define dependencies between jobs. For example, if a batch job fin­
ishes with errors, these need to be corrected before the next job can be run; an example 
of this is in product costing (please refer to Section 5.5), where you would want to cor­
rect errors in the work in process and variance jobs before running the settlement to 
post the results to the General Ledger.
You can also monitor the performance of the batch jobs across periods. Each task has an 
estimated runtime. As shown in Figure 6.4, the performance of the jobs can be monitored

across time, where exceptions are prominently highlighted. An analysis of the batch job 
performance may indicate that system performance tuning is required; alternatively, if 
the longer runtimes are due to a growing volume of data, you may want to adjust the 
expected time, or investigate whether archiving of data may be necessary.
Figure 6.4  Monitoring Programs and Batch Jobs through a Comparison to Planned, 
or Expected, Execution Time.
Although the SAP Financial Closing cockpit allows you to schedule remote jobs in mul­
tiple SAP ERP systems even without the partner solution, SAP Central Process Schedul­
ing by Redwood is required if you need to run jobs in other SAP systems such as SAP 
Customer Relationship Management (SAP CRM) or SAP NetWeaver BW, as well as 
incorporate tasks to be executed in non-SAP systems.
Let’s look at how Dow Chemicals was able to standardize and streamline its finan­
cial close with the SAP Financial Closing cockpit and SAP Central Process Sched­
uling by Redwood.
6.3
Customer Story: Dow Chemicals’ Faster, Less Costly 
Financial Close Process with SAP Solutions
Since it was founded by Herbert Henry Dow in Midland, Michigan, in 1897, 
innovation has enabled Dow Chemical to grow into a global company with a port­
folio of more than 5,000 science-based products that it delivers to customers in 
approximately 160 countries. Today, with annual sales of nearly US$54 billion, 
the company runs 188 manufacturing sites in 35 different countries. And with 

Monitor the Entity Close
137
6.4
close to 50,000 employees, it operates more than 750 subsidiary companies 
around the world.
But the spirit of innovation at Dow does not stop with its products and services; 
it also extends to back-office functions such as the financial close. Growth caused 
this process to become exceptionally complex and time-consuming with more 
than 1,000 different month-end jobs that were being manually coordinated by 
emails and spreadsheets.
During the 20 years that Dow has been an SAP customer, it has established a 
strong, trusting relationship with the company now helping to determine some 
of the functionality in recent SAP software releases. So when SAP suggested that 
the issues with the financial close process could be resolved with the SAP Finan­
cial Closing cockpit, the finance team listened. This solution centralizes the finan­
cial close process, automates key tasks, measures closing-cycle efficiency, and 
facilitates collaboration with an intuitive interface that gives real-time visibility 
throughout the process. At the same time, Dow also implemented the SAP Cen­
tral Process Scheduling application by Redwood, which automates the batch pro­
cessing of data during the close process.
Today, Dow has a single point of entry for all of its financial closing activities with 
a single global template that standardizes the financial close process across all its 
subsidiaries. Accessing this through Dow’s corporate portal, finance staff can 
track progress with a complete, real-time overview of closing status and drill-
down functionality for more details. Because all of the steps in the close are now 
automatically scheduled, the finance team is free for more value-adding work, but 
should any issues arise with the close, they can be quickly resolved using the solu­
tions’ collaboration functionality.
Since implementing the SAP Financial Closing cockpit and SAP Central Process 
Scheduling, Dow completes its month-end closes in a fraction of the time with 
improved efficiency, better visibility, and reduced costs—all helping the com­
pany keep a step ahead of the competition, even in its back-office processes.
6.4
Monitor the Entity Close
The SAP Financial Closing cockpit provides you with a single environment with a 
real-time view of every closing cycle task and its status. In addition to monitoring 

Entity Close Management
138
6
the automated jobs, as described in the “Scheduling Automated Financial Close 
Tasks” box in the previous section, you can also monitor the entire entity close 
process.
From a macro perspective, you can view the execution of the close using the task 
list, as shown earlier in Figure 6.2, or you can use a graphical Gantt chart view, as 
shown in Figure 6.5. By monitoring the entity close closely, you can identify 
issues, overdue tasks, and resource bottlenecks early in the close cycle before the 
overall close schedule is impacted.
From a micro perspective, you can drill down on each task to view its status and 
other details that have been documented about the task. You can use notes and 
attachments to document any collaboration or the resolution of any issues that 
you encountered. For automated tasks, such as programs that were run, you can 
directly access system logs and spool lists from the SAP Financial Closing cockpit
without needing to search for them. The system provides a complete audit trail 
for configuration and execution. You can easily analyze any kind of status change, 
how often a task was executed, or who added or changed notes and attachments.
Finally, you can create a graphical dashboard to obtain an overview of the finan­
cial close, as shown in Figure 6.6. In this dashboard, which leverages SAP Busi­
nessObjects Business Intelligence capabilities, you can create key performance

indicators (KPIs) and calculate statistics, such as the percent of completion of the 
close, to allow you to quickly monitor the overall progress across regions and 
time frames.
6.5
Summary
The SAP Financial Closing cockpit allows you to centralize, automate, and accel­
erate the steps that you need to process the financial close each of your entities, 
and it enables you to ensure that the steps are executed in a repeatable manner 
for consistency and auditability. The steps include manual tasks as well as sched­
uling transaction and programs that need to be run as part of the close. In addi­
tion, you can monitor the status of the close, drill down to the task level for 
additional details if you encounter an issue, and obtain KPIs of the status of the 
close at any time. All this enables compliance and provides stronger governance.
Now that we have looked at the entity close, in the next chapter, we will cover the 
extended controls you can use to ensure that the close is compliant and auditable, 
which are available using SAP solutions for governance, risk, and compliance 
(GRC).

Putting appropriate internal controls in place ensures a compliant finan­
cial close and enables external auditors to audit and report on these con­
trols as part of the required disclosures in financial statements. This chap­
ter will explore internal controls and their value in compliance.
7
Enhanced Internal Controls for Better 
Compliance
The financial close culminates with the issuance of reports that highlight the 
financial outcomes for the business. Many companies must also report on the 
health and integrity of their business. For these companies, a part of the financial 
close is accumulating and reporting on information about the orderly execution 
of your business, especially your financial processes. For many, the periodic 
financial close includes routine reports that internal controls are in place and 
effective. This is done to provide assurances to management, investors, and regu­
lators that your business processes are well designed, and executed as designed 
and in an orderly way. Regulators in many countries require that management 
assess and publicly report on the internal controls related to the preparation and 
issuance of financial statements. Beyond this, external auditors may be required 
to independently audit internal controls. Depending on your business and indus­
try, you may have a number of regulatory compliance requirements related to 
your internal controls.
Internal controls are rules or standards that dictate how a business process is to 
be executed. The controls ensure that this is done with integrity and in a predict­
able, transparent, and repeatable way. Controls are also designed to ensure that 
an affected business process follows all of the rules set by regulators. There may 
be a focus on particular controls where there is a risk that a business process step 
may not be executed as desired or required.
There are many ways to categorize the various types of controls. For this discus­
sion, consider these different types of controls:

Enhanced Internal Controls for Better Compliance
142
7
 Access controls that dictate who executes steps in a business process, what 
business systems they have rights to, and what types of data they can view and 
update. Ultimately, these controls ensure that employees have access to the 
data and systems that enable them to fulfill their responsibilities.
 Segregation of duties (SoDs) controls that ensure the execution of multiple 
steps in a business process are performed by different people to minimize the 
opportunity for fraud and abuse.
 Business process controls that outline the expected or proper way for a series 
of business process to execute. For example, a purchase order must be issued 
to a supplier to purchase goods or services, and the purchase order must be 
issued prior to the delivery of those goods or services. Another example is a 
business process that requires approvals at defined stages in a process, for 
example travel and expense approvals.
 Account reconciliations that require a person to explain the difference between 
multiple collections of related transactions.
 Physical inventories that ensure the amount of materials on hand is as expected 
based on a system-maintained inventory.
Controls should be in place and executed as business processes proceed. A rou­
tine examination, commonly referred to as a control test, should be completed at 
a predefined frequency. Any test failures must be corrected. The results of all con­
trol tests should be aggregated and reported to senior management, investors, 
and regulators. The ultimate goal is to report that controls are in place and effec­
tive. For many companies that publicly issue financial reports, this report of con­
trol effectiveness is done at the same time and, therefore, considered an integral 
part of the financial close.
Technology, specifically software solutions, can play a considerable role in help­
ing companies and other organizations manage controls programs and execute 
control testing. SAP solutions for governance, risk and compliance (GRC) allow 
you to address compliance and controls requirements and, ultimately, ensure that 
your financial close more compliant. These solutions help you automate both 
access controls and process management to prevent unauthorized access to sensi­
tive and key corporate information, as well as detect fraud and abuse. Once con­
figured, these solutions provide continuous monitoring of key risk indicators and 
compliance effectiveness across enterprise systems, business processes, and IT

infrastructures that enable you to align risks and compliance programs to strate­
gic initiatives, plans, and execution.
Let’s take a look at a customer story. Natura had identified weaknesses related to 
the control of access to information and implemented SAP Access Control to 
resolve these issues.
Customer Story: Natura Consolidates a Governance Model to Lower the 
Information Security Risk
Faced with a high level of information security risk, Brazilian personal care spe­
cialist Natura began a process to strengthen its governance model. An audit iden­
tified a number of weaknesses, particularly the lack of a solid strategy for 
managing access. Additionally, the company did not have a culture of governance 
and information security, and the low level of involvement of business areas in 
the process of risk assessment made the situation even harder to manage. A 
change in corporate culture was necessary.
Natura finished creating a risk matrix in 2009. That year, it also implemented SAP 
Access Control and adapted its processes to conform to the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) 
Act, which requires the creation of reliable mechanisms for auditing and security 
to mitigate a company’s business risks. The new governance model that Natura 
established allowed for a more accurate assessment of security risks as well as the 
fulfillment of compliance regulations resulting in the company obtaining SOX 
certification. With the support of SAP software, Natura saw its level of informa­
tion security risk drop by an estimated 69%.
But as the company grew, it needed to further strengthen the governance model 
and the strategy for managing access. So, in 2010, Natura upgraded SAP Access 
Control to consolidate its governance model while at the same time benefitting 
from simpler interfaces and better integration with the existing SAP architecture. 
This upgrade has allowed for more complete, compliant reporting as well as 
reducing the time needed to prepare reports for auditing by 60%. The upgrade 
also required a reassessment of access, allowing inactive profiles to be excluded. 
Thus, the access matrix used by SAP Access Control became leaner, with a result­
ing 30% drop in transaction volume per profile. Natura also experienced lower 
maintenance costs with 50% fewer support calls being made to customer service.
Raising the business areas’ understanding of processes related to the governance 
model has created a new culture of risk management at Natura. The time needed 

Enhanced Internal Controls for Better Compliance
144
7
to maintain controls for employee compensation has fallen by 15–20%, and, the 
consolidation of the governance model at Natura has achieved a total reduction of 
87% in information security risk overall. Now let’s take a look at how effective 
access risk management plays an important role in the finance organization.
7.1
Access Risk Management
If we look specifically at the financial close process, team members need access to 
both information and transactions in order to execute financial close activities. 
Managing access manually is time-consuming and increases the risk that team 
members are unable to perform their responsibilities if access isn’t granted, as 
well as the risk that team members will have too much access to sensitive data.
With SAP Access Control, you can automate processes to detect, remediate, and 
prevent access violations; streamline and automate user provisioning; and cen­
tralize role management. This helps reduce the cost of access management, audit, 
and ongoing compliance activities while minimizing the risk of internal fraud.
Automating user access management tasks makes it easier for users to obtain the 
access that they need in a timely manner while maintaining compliance.
SAP Access Control provides a standardized and centralized framework for users 
to request the access that they need and approvers to review and manage those 
requests. Team members can create access requests, as shown in Figure 7.1.
Figure 7.1  Requesting Roles through SAP Access Control

Access Risk Management
145
7.1
After a request is submitted, an automated workflow engine sends the request to 
one or more approvers for processing. Analyzing the risks associated with the 
requested access is a critical step in the process, which should be addressed 
before access is assigned to ensure identified risks are adequately mitigated. Here, 
risks may be identified due to a segregation of duty (SoD) or critical access viola­
tion (see Section 7.1.1 for more on SoD). During the workflow process, a risk 
analysis can be made mandatory to check for risks that are introduced by the roles 
requested in conjunction with any roles that are already assigned to the user. 
These requests can be accepted or rejected either online or through a mobile app 
(see Figure 7.2) as discussed in the “Mobile Apps for Faster Response to Risk” 
box.
At times, a user may need temporary access outside of normal job responsibili­
ties. Also, a team member may need access that is sensitive in nature and must be 
tracked for audit purposes, for example, maintaining posting periods during the 
close process, or updating vendor accounts as part of the accounts payable close 
while a colleague is on vacation. The emergency access management capability of 
SAP Access Control allows employees to execute tasks under a firefighter ID in an 
auditable manner. The application provides a closed-loop process for managing 
emergency access—automating the request, approval, access monitoring, and 
review of activities performed—in a centralized location with a full audit trail.
Mobile Apps for Faster Responses to Risk
When you make your compliance processes mobile, your finance teams have the tools 
they need to manage risks and policies on their mobile devices in real time. For exam­
ple:
 SAP GRC Access Approver mobile app
This app helps you ensure that the right employees have access to the right systems. 
Finance officers can review and approve time-sensitive access requests on their 
mobile devices, allowing requests to be answered quickly without an increase in 
compliance risk. The app leverages automated rules in SAP Access Control and flags 
requests that have been evaluated as being risky, as shown in Figure 7.2.
 SAP GRC Policy Survey mobile app
This app helps you keep track of the latest policy changes within your organization. 
Managers can minimize compliance risk while taking surveys to help understand the 
full implications of new policies. An example is distributing corporate codes of con­
duct documents, with survey questions asking employees to acknowledge their 
acceptance of these policies; these policies are often referenced in an annual report.

Ultimately SAP Access Control enables the finance organization to have real-time 
visibility into the access that team members have and the risk that is presented as 
a result. Without an automated solution, it is nearly impossible to have an accu­
rate view of access governance and to ensure that any access risk violations are 
effectively mitigated.
7.1.1
Segregation of Duties
Segregation of duties (SoD) is a primary internal control intended to prevent 
internal fraud and error by separating tasks within a business process between 
multiple users. An example of this in the financial close process is separating the 
responsibility for depositing cash and reconciling bank statements, or the ability 
to receive checks as payment and the responsibility for write-offs.
Implementing SoDs can be challenging for companies small and large, as many 
times it is impossible to completely segregate incompatible duties. In these cases, 
mitigating controls should be implemented to minimize the risk.
Let’s take a look at a customer story. Infosys Limited was able to practically elim­
inate SoD violations with SAP Access Control.

Customer Story: Infosys Treats Governance and Compliance 
Strategically with SAP Access Control
Infosys Limited is one of the largest technology services companies in the world 
with a staff of 150,000 in 64 offices and 63 development centers providing tech­
nology-enabled business solutions for Global 2000 companies.
With a stated vision to become a globally respected corporation and a mission to 
build an enterprise prepared for tomorrow, the executive team at Infosys priori­
tized the need to embrace robust corporate governance and implement vigorous 
risk management practices, viewing them not just as an obligatory obligation but 
as something that could drive competitive advantage and business performance.
Recognizing that they lacked a systematic and efficient way of handling gover­
nance, risk, and compliance across the enterprise, the management team 
endorsed the need for investment. As a first step, Infosys integrated the SAP 
Access Control application into their existing SAP ERP application backbone. A 
multidisciplinary team made up of business process owners and individuals from 
enterprise audit, IT, and enterprise risk management was assembled to identify 
enterprise SoD risks. The team analyzed risks from a number of business units 
against the end-to-end business processes, the responsibility of users involved in 
the business operations, and a standard SoD rule set provided by the SAP soft­
ware—and after several iterations, identified and categorized SoD risks based on 
the business impact. This provided the basis for revoking unnecessary access per­
missions and remapping those that were really needed.
Through SAP Access Control, the team mapped out governance policies for role 
management so that SoD risk analysis could be performed before roles were 
released to the test and production environment. This eliminated the ability to 
create roles that resulted in SoD violations. With SAP Access Control up and run­
ning, Infosys has successfully embedded compliance into its core business pro­
cesses with automated and real-time monitoring of access permissions and 
conflicts in the system resulting in the early detection of potential risks and pro­
active prevention of possible SoD conflicts. In fact, the organization has reduced 
the human effort associated with user access provisioning and deprovisioning by 
80% and has entirely eliminated SoD violations.
Let’s now take a look at managing not just access to individual transactions and 
data, but how controls are implemented across business processes.

7.2
Identifying Controls across a Business Process
The need for controls goes beyond effective access risk management. Compliance 
requirements often dictate that you document your collection of controls and 
execute periodic controls testing. For many compliance programs, the execution 
of and reporting on control testing coincides closely with required financial 
reporting. There is, therefore, a need to incorporate compliance and other associ­
ated tasks into the prototypical close process. The controls and associated control 
testing relate to various business processes. The controls integral to financial busi­
ness processes, including general accounting, revenue recognition, accounts pay­
able and receivable, and financial statement preparation, are always in scope.
SAP Process Control technology can and, especially for larger companies, should 
enable the documentation of controls, control testing, and aggregation of 
required signatures or approvals. SAP Process Control is an application for com­
pliance and policy management. It helps you by focusing resources on key risks—
the most critical regulatory requirements and high impact processes—and by pro­
viding continuous insight into your compliance and controls status for better 
decision making. Automated control testing can be executed via a connection to 
the SAP ERP system.
Let’s look at how controls are created and the remediation that can be used when 
the control is violated.
7.2.1
Control Monitoring and Remediation
Internal controls are rules or standards that dictate how a business process is to 
be executed. The controls ensure that this is done with integrity and in a predict­
able, transparent, and repeatable way. Controls are also designed to ensure that 
an affected business process follows all of the rules set by regulators. There may 
be a focus on particular controls where there is a risk that a business process step 
may not be executed as desired or required.
A control is created where a step in a business includes risk that that activity will 
not be completed as required. These controls need to be tested on a periodic basis 
so that any violations can be identified and resolved. Depending on the control, 
testing may need to be done manually, or in a semi-automated or automated fash­
ion.

Identifying Controls across a Business Process
149
7.2
The following types of automated and semi-automated controls monitor informa­
tion in SAP ERP:
 Configuration controls to identify unauthorized configuration settings.
 Master data controls to identify suspicious settings in master data records.
 Transaction data controls to identify unusual business transactions.
For example, in the context of the financial close, the change in the useful life for 
large capital investments, such as buildings, can have a dramatic impact on the 
depreciation that is posted. For such a control, as shown in Figure 7.3, automated 
monitoring and testing is possible through a connection with the SAP ERP system 
where the fixed assets module has been implemented.
When a control test fails, it is highlighted as part of the comprehensive monitor­
ing available with SAP Process Control. The workflow capabilities then route the 
violation to the owner, who can determine the needed remediation steps. This 
plan can include activities to mitigate any risk and may involve changing a policy 
or a configuration setting in order to maintain compliance. For example, if a vio­
lation has been identified due to a manual journal entry, as shown in Figure 7.4, 
Figure 7.3  Defining a Process Control

Enhanced Internal Controls for Better Compliance
150
7
you may want to disallow manual entries on particular accounts or implement 
other safeguards for reviewing such entries in the future. Similar controls are in 
place for other financial business process steps. Correspondingly, control tests are 
in place and executed routinely. The results of the control tests and any outstand­
ing remediation tasks must be reviewed during the financial close process. This is 
done to ensure that all controls related to financial business processes are in place 
and effective. Ultimately, management may issue a statement affirming this to 
comply with regulatory reporting requirements.
In the next section, we will look at a customer, REC Silicon, who was able to 
increase visibility into its processes using SAP Process Control.
7.2.2
Customer Story: REC Silicon, Inc. Leverages Enhanced Process 
Controls
At its production facilities in Moses Lake in the state of Washington and Butte in 
Montana, REC Silicon, Inc., produces silane gas and electronic and solar-grade sil­
icon that are used by its sister companies in the REC group and third parties in the 
manufacture of solar panels.
Figure 7.4  Defining a Remediation Plan

Audit Management
151
7.3
The company needed to improve its management of financial business processes, 
which were entirely manual and paper-based, in order to further enhance the 
group’s ongoing commitment to regulatory compliance regarding process control 
monitoring. At the same time, it hoped automation would reduce the internal 
workload associated with process controls and the cost of external auditing. The 
REC group had recognized the benefits of creating an IT foundation to support a 
more global, complex organization and had already implemented standard inte­
grated SAP applications in areas such as financials, sales, manufacturing, procure­
ment, and reporting. Into this now uniform environment, a project team made 
up of REC Silicon staff and SAP Consulting introduced the SAP Process Control 
application, which effectively provided information system controls for the exist­
ing financial applications and delivered the compliance reporting functionality 
that was required.
Running the business using a single instance of SAP applications meant fewer 
overall systems in operation so the IT team could develop deep expertise and 
focus dedicated resources on projects that supported ongoing improvements 
across the business, including the management of core financial processes. The 
introduction of the SAP Process Control application into this standardized envi­
ronment allowed essential financial processes during closings, reconciliations, 
and account postings to be monitored and reviewed well in advance of quarterly 
discussions with the external auditors. This substantially improved existing appli­
cation and process controls and enabled the company to put the required gover­
nance frameworks into practice on a monthly, weekly, and even daily basis with 
tools that enabled the necessary monitoring.
Having better visibility into financial processes also reduced the number of ad 
hoc reporting requests that were typically required to meet compliance needs 
during audits, and it is anticipated that both the impact and cost of external audits 
will be reduced. Next, let’s consider a special case for the use of SAP Process Con­
trol: the management of internal audits.
7.3
Audit Management
For the annual internal audit, your challenges are maintaining audit quality stan­
dards, managing work papers, and audit reporting—often with scarce resources. 
To help you manage the auditing process, SAP Audit Management, powered by 

Enhanced Internal Controls for Better Compliance
152

SAP HANA, leverages several components, including SAP Process Control, SAP 
Audit Management from SAP ERP and SAP NetWeaver, and SAP Multiresource 
Scheduling. These tools help you standardize the audit documentation and test 
procedures, create workflow functionality, and identify the required reporting. 
You may also choose to use SAP Risk Management to prioritize audit activities.
With SAP Audit Management, you can use existing GRC data on risk assessment 
results to facilitate risk-based scoping for the annual audit plan, including audit 
planning, preparation, execution, and reporting.
You then create the audit plan by copying an audit plan template. Figure 7.5
shows an initial audit plan structure. You may want to create different templates, 
depending on the timing of the audit (quarterly and annually), or the type of 
audit, for example, a SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley) audit, tax audit, or fraud audit. Other 
information includes the dates of the audit, documentation that needs to be com­
pleted, and question lists.
You can also identify the resources that are required for the audit. If you are using 
the scheduling component, then you can check on the availability of the resources 
during the period of time that the audit is taking place.
Figure 7.5  Control Audit Steps with an Audit Plan

7.4
After the audit has been released, work can begin. The resources that are execut­
ing the audit can document their work, include test results from predefined pro­
cedures, and respond to internal controls and risks that were previously 
identified. Work papers can be attached so that all documentation is in one place. 
As each step is completed, an employee can then set the status of that step.
Managers can enter review notes for the audit procedure, providing the ability to 
review the audit file to ensure that it has been prepared in accordance with inter­
nal audit’s methodology and IIA (Institute of Internal Auditors) standards, for 
assurance that the work performed has addressed all risks identified within the 
scope of the audit. It also provides the ability to input reviewer comments and 
provide approval.
After all of the test procedures are complete, the audit lead then enters an overall 
assessment and rating for the entire audit. The degree of fulfillment and the over­
all assessment is automatically calculated based on the valuation assignment in 
the individual audit steps.
From within the audit plan, you can generate the audit report, which includes 
background information on the business unit under audit, scope of the audit, and 
identification of key issues, findings, and internal control weaknesses that need 
to be addressed, as well as the key stakeholders accountable to address them.
Now let’s take a look at advanced reporting and analytics capabilities that you can 
use to analyze your compliance effectiveness.
7.4
GRC Analytics
Prior to the availability of analytic solutions, many compliance officers spent the 
majority of their time running reports, collating the results, managing spread­
sheets, calling other employees, and sending emails to analyze the state of access 
compliance. By using analytics capabilities, you can be more proactive in identi­
fying risks and monitoring risk violations.
With SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence (BI) solutions, dashboards, such 
as the one shown in Figure 7.6, are available to allow you fast access to compli­
ance information. Dashboards provide the following information:

Enhanced Internal Controls for Better Compliance
154
7
 Access risks allow you to identify overall risk violations and identify business 
processes at the highest risk.
 Alerts allow you to identify which acts were actually performed and by which 
users.
 Review of access rules includes looking at how access risks are defined and 
how functional rules are mapped to the transactions being monitored.
 Role reviews identify which users are assigned to which roles, as well as which 
roles are orphaned, or not in use.
 Review of emergency access allows you to monitor the audit trail and the fre­
quency of use of the firefighter ID.
As the workforce becomes increasingly mobile, you need to be able to access risk 
and compliance information quickly. With SAP Access Control dashboards, 
which are available on a desktop browser as well as on mobile devices, you can 
access all of the information you need while on the go to ensure your company is 
Figure 7.6  Monitoring Access Risks and Violations with Dashboards

within access compliance, for example, for a quarterly internal audit. In the dash­
board shown in Figure 7.7, you can analyze the trends related to access risk to 
determine whether one business process has increased or decreased violations, 
for example, on a quarter over quarter basis. In addition, you can analyze viola­
tions of your SoD rules. For each area, you can drill down to more detailed infor­
mation.
The information provided may lead you to make decisions related to user access. 
For example, you can remove critical or sensitive access from an employee’s 
everyday role and instead have the employee perform the activities through a 
firefighter ID. This allows the users to do the job they need to, while giving com­
pliance officers and auditors the extra layer of reporting for sensitive informa­
tion.

Leveraging SAP HANA for Compliance
Using the SAP HANA platform, SAP solutions for GRC benefit from greater and timelier 
access to data for monitoring and reporting purposes. The following are two examples 
where the real-time power of SAP HANA is leveraged in these solutions:
 With the SAP HANA Live for SAP solutions for GRC and integration with the SAP 
NetWeaver Business Warehouse (SAP NetWeaver BW) application, you can create a 
virtual data model. This enables custom reporting through the SAP BusinessObjects 
portfolio and increases the speed of your access to information for analysis.
 The SAP Fraud Management application, powered by SAP HANA, allows you to 
uncover hidden trends and patterns in large amounts of data to detect fraud in near 
real time. In addition to the advanced analytic capabilities, the application includes 
simulation features to reduce false positives and enables you to proactively develop 
fraud-prevention strategies.
7.5
Summary
The financial close includes critical activities to affirm that key controls through­
out the business are in place and effective. These tasks must be completed in con­
junction with other well-known tasks that are considered part of the financial 
close. Technology should play a role to ensure that these tasks are repeatable, 
independent, and objective. SAP solutions for GRC allow you to effectively auto­
mate all of the required activities. By doing so, you can better manage your risk 
and compliance programs, protect your revenue streams and reputation, opti­
mize business operations, and improve financial performance. In the next chap­
ter, we will look at preparing for the group close by exploring how to process 
intercompany reconciliations.

157
Intercompany reconciliation has been cited for many years as one of the 
most common and frequently occurring barriers to a fast, high-quality 
close. The question is: what can you do about it? This chapter aims to pro­
vide you with some answers.

Intercompany Reconciliation
In this chapter we will discuss the challenges and possible solutions surrounding 
intercompany reconciliation. We will begin by defining intercompany reconcilia­
tion then discuss the solutions SAP has to offer. We will discuss not only how 
these common challenges can be addressed with software solutions but also how 
addressing the overall process can improve business results and showcase 
improvements. This chapter covers the intercompany reconciliation process at a 
high level and showcases the options and business benefits of SAP’s solutions for 
today’s enterprises. Let’s start by defining what we mean by intercompany recon­
ciliation.
8.1
Defining Intercompany Reconciliation
During the financial close process, business organizations must eliminate inter­
company activity so they do not overstate account balances. For example, if 
Entity A has a $100 accounts payable (AP) transaction due to Entity B, Entity B 
should have a corresponding accounts receivable (AR) transaction on its books. 
These amounts need to be eliminated before the total AP and AR amounts are cal­
culated for the entire organization so they are not overstated. Before these 
accounts are eliminated, they first need to be reconciled. The intercompany rec­
onciliation process is often referred to as intercompany matching (see Figure 8.1).
There are many reasons intercompany account balances between entities might 
not match, including timing of recording the transactions, exchange rate differ­
ences, or even outright mistakes. Typically, the reconciliation process starts at the 
account level by comparing intercompany AP against intercompany AR. When 

Intercompany Reconciliation
158

the intercompany account balances don’t match, then detailed transactional or 
invoice level data is consulted.
Each entity’s transactional and invoice level details are typically captured in the 
General Ledger (GL) system. Most GL systems allow for the recording of the trad­
ing partner. Most transactional systems can record the intercompany trading 
partner when the transaction is recorded. This level of detail is required to auto­
mate intercompany reconciliation and elimination. Now we have defined the 
issue, the following sections will introduce different solutions to address these 
challenges, both from a technology and a process angle.
8.2
SAP Solutions for Intercompany Reconciliation
As discussed in the prior section, during the consolidation process, intercompany 
data must first be reconciled at the account or balance level. These balances are 
made up of transactions, so to reconcile the balances, you must dive into the 
details.
Challenges around intercompany reconciliation vary based on the structure of 
your source systems that capture transactional intercompany data. Source inter­
company data typically comes from a GL system. If your organization has many 
disparate sources systems, there will be more challenges when reconciling inter­
company data than if you have one source system.
SAP offers two solutions specifically for intercompany reconciliation:
 Intercompany Reconciliation (ICR): Cross-company Intercompany Reconcilia­
tion is a part of the Financials Extension (EA-FIN) business function. 
 SAP Intercompany: SAP Intercompany is part of the Enterprise Performance 
Management (EPM) suite.

SAP Intercompany Licensing Note
Although SAP Intercompany can be licensed separately for use with non-SAP consolida­
tion systems, it is included with the license rights of SAP Business Planning and Consol­
idation and SAP Financial Consolidation.
The following sections will discuss which solution is better suited for different 
environments.
8.2.1
One Source System
Many organizations are moving toward one standard transactional system. In the 
event that your organization has one instance of an enterprise resource planning 
(ERP) system, intercompany reconciliation has fewer moving parts. When all the 
transactional or invoice data is contained in one system it makes it easier to man­
age.
For organizations who are centralized on once instance of an SAP ERP there is an 
intercompany solution included. Intercompany Reconciliation (ICR) is part of the 
SAP ERP. ICR can be used for transactional matching when all reconciling entities 
are on SAP ERP and all relevant data is stored in SAP ERP. Cross-company ICR is 
a part of the Financials Extension (EA-FIN) business.
The purpose of ICR is to ensure that intercompany documents from accounting 
transactions within the corporate group correspond to one another. It contains 
tools that check whether documents have been correctly assigned to a business 
transaction, tools that enable you to find corresponding documents easily, and 
tools to make additional assignments. ICR operates on the level of companies and 
partner companies (trading partners).
If the reconciliation process is successful, this will ultimately lead to reduced dif­
ferences in corporate group consolidation.
SAP Intercompany, on the other hand, is part of SAP’s EPM suite. SAP Intercom­
pany is a peer-to-peer web based solution. See Table 8.1 which defines the differ­
ences between the two solutions.

8.2.2
Multiple Intercompany Source Systems
Many organizations have multiple instances of source transactional systems. Dif­
ferent divisions or geographical regions may be using different GL systems. They 
could be different instances of an SAP ERP system, for example, or there could be 
Oracle in Europe, JD Edwards in Latin America, and SAP in Japan.
In this case, the ability to reconcile between entities that are on different source 
systems becomes more challenging. SAP Intercompany is a solution perfect for 
this type of landscape.

Leveraging Consolidation Systems for Intercompany 
Reconciliation
As discussed both ICR and SAP Intercompany are leveraged for reconciling inter­
company information at the transactional or account detail level. Consolidation 
systems such as SAP Business Planning and Consolidation and SAP Financial Con­
solidation (discussed further in Chapter 9) reconcile intercompany information at 
the account level and not at the invoice or transactional level. As such, additional 
tools are required to reach that lower level of detail.
8.3
Managing the Intercompany Process
In the previous section, we introduced how different technology landscapes can 
affect the intercompany process; let’s now explore options for varying the inter­
company process.
8.3.1
Traditional Intercompany Reconciliation Process
Traditionally, the reconciliation process is managed by corporate headquarters. 
They collect data from the various reporting units and, in some cases, need to 
normalize the data. Once collected from all reporting units, a reconciliation pro­
cess is run that matches all of the intercompany data against the corresponding 
entities. Many organizations rely on financial consolidation systems as their 
intercompany reconciliation tool, which are usually designed to capture account 
balances, rather than the transactional detail required, as discussed in Section 
8.2.3. Reports are created that highlight the out-of-balance information and are 
then returned to the reporting units (see Figure 8.2).
The reporting units then drill back to the transactional detail manually to under­
stand what makes up the account balances. After retrieving the detail, they corre­
spond with the other entities via phone, fax, or email to determine why the 
discrepancies exist. Not only is this manual reconciliation time consuming, but it 
is also difficult to trace as much of the unstructured data contained in emails that 
are not easily audited.
Reporting units wait until the end of the period and rely on communications 
from corporate before they begin to look at the intercompany balance. Corporate 
becomes not only the intermediary but also the policing agent to ensure that the 

Intercompany Reconciliation
162

balances are reconciled. Headquarters become overwhelmed managing reconcili­
ations rather than other closing tasks for which they are better suited. The lack of 
direct contact between reporting units results in a bottleneck at corporate head­
quarters that creates an inefficient vertical flow of information between head­
quarters and the reporting units. Extensive procedures and forms need to be 
created to manage the process as well.
8.3.2
Peer-to-Peer Intercompany Reconciliation Process
A peer-to-peer reconciliation process pulls the intercompany reconciliation pro­
cess out of the critical path of the close process. Reporting units in this process 
deal directly with one another in a peer-to-peer fashion rather than using corpo­
rate as an intermediary (see Figure 8.3).
By distributing the responsibility out to the reporting units, it frees central 
finance staff from time spent on non-value-added tasks and allows them more 
time to analyze data and determine why things happened rather than just being 
able to account for what happened.
Effective collaboration is key when reconciling intercompany balances. The typi­
cal reconciliation process involves emails and phone calls that cannot be easily 
traced or documented. The collaboration features in SAP Intercompany enable 
users to attach comments and other documents to facilitate more efficient com­
munication.

Faster, Collaborative Intercompany Reconciliation 
with SAP Intercompany
SAP Intercompany enables your reporting units to reconcile intercompany bal­
ances in real time and allows your corporation to close its books faster. The first 
intercompany application to work independently of a consolidation system, SAP 
Intercompany provides the tools for your business units to debate and reconcile 
account balances and transaction-level detail directly with one another. That 
means it eliminates extra work and delays at the corporate and divisional levels. 
The application also helps improve your close process by removing intercompany 
reconciliation from the critical path, increasing both speed and accuracy.
8.4.1
Web-Based, Peer-to-Peer Communication
SAP Intercompany introduces a web-based, peer-to-peer communication channel 
between your reporting units that post intercompany balances and transactions 
against each other. This lateral flow of information and automatic matching helps 
ensure faster agreements—easing the burden on corporate finance and eliminat­
ing days from the time-consuming closing process (see Figure 8.4).
When users log on, they instantly get a clear view of which entities are out of bal­
ance and where they need to drill down further, shown in Figure 8.4.

Collaboration, Monitoring, and Approval
SAP Intercompany offers sophisticated status tracking, email summaries, alerts on 
significant events, and a complete audit trail. Users can have threaded conversa­
tions within the application so counterparts can easily communicate in a central 
place back and forth. This is a major benefit because this type of communication 
would otherwise be done via email or over the phone, neither of which is easily 
traced. The collaborative nature of the tool makes it easy for multiple people to 
have access to the information. If someone is out on vacation or sick, or there is 
turnover in a position, all users with access can see the conversations related to 
the reconciliation.
In addition to added comments during the reconciliation process, users can also 
attach documents. Scanned or digitally printed invoices can be loaded to the sys­
tem for reference, saving the users from having to save them offline somewhere.
You can also leverage a comprehensive set of reconciliation reports that enable 
individual reporting units as well as corporate headquarters to fully automate and 
follow their global intercompany process.

8.5
Corporate Visibility into the Reconciliation Process
SAP Intercompany allows your corporate or divisional headquarters to monitor 
the collaborative matching process continuously, using standardized exchange 
rates, material levels, and dedicated reconciliation views. This enables at-a-glance 
status checks of the global reconciliation process. Corporate can still maintain 
control and visibility of the process without having to be the main drivers.
A “freezing” feature prevents users from making additional changes after a cycle 
has ended. This provides further control for corporate to ensure that changes 
aren’t made after a certain point in time.
Now that we have reviewed the benefits and functions of SAP Intercompany, let’s 
review the different deployment options available.
8.5
SAP Intercompany Deployment Options
SAP Intercompany can be integrated into both SAP and non-SAP software envi­
ronments and can load source data from any GL or consolidation application. SAP 
Intercompany is fully supported by the SAP Financial Information Management 
application discussed in Chapter 3, letting you manage the process of accessing, 
mapping, and loading information from multiple source systems. SAP Intercom­
pany can be accessed directly from the SAP Financial Consolidation application.
Landscape Scenarios
The flow of data in and out of SAP Intercompany is contingent on your particular 
landscape and preferences. The flexibility exists to create different types of envi­
ronments based on different requirements.
In any scenario, reporting units can import intercompany data at either the 
account balance or invoice level into SAP Intercompany. Once loaded, they can 
see real-time visibility into other reporting units with which they are out of 
balance. It is clearly indicated if a corresponding entity has not yet loaded its bal­
ances, creating an out of balance.
There are many ways to set up a landscape that includes SAP Intercompany; the 
following subsections describe a couple of examples.

Data Entry and Adjustments in SAP Intercompany
In this scenario, users are granted the ability to make adjustments and enter data 
manually into the SAP Intercompany application. The application tracks between 
what was loaded versus what was entered manually. As such, adjustment data can 
easily be exported back to the source systems (see Figure 8.5).
Data can then be imported into the consolidation package from both SAP Inter­
company and back-office reporting units. Reconciliation reports between the sys­
tems are usually used in this scenario to ensure consistency of data across the 
systems.
8.5.2
No Data Entry or Adjustments in SAP Intercompany
In this scenario, data is loaded to SAP Intercompany, and users use it for collabo­
ration and to share information. Users are prohibited from making any changes 
to the data within the SAP Intercompany application. All adjustments must be 
made in the reporting units back-office systems, and then data is reloaded to SAP 
Intercompany (see Figure 8.6).

This scenario is commonly used when organizations have one or just a few 
instances of their GL system. Many organizations consider their GL to be their 
book of record and want to ensure all changes are made inside those systems. It 
is also commonly used when there is no separate consolidation package, and the 
consolidation is performed fully in the GL.

Security and Configuration
To enhance security, SAP Intercompany provides centrally managed and easily 
configured access rights and is compatible with existing security infrastructure 
investments such as firewalls, public key infrastructures, Secure Sockets Layer 
(SSL), and virtual private networks. Audit reports are available that provide visi­
bility into who logged on to the system and when, as well as what data was 
loaded.

Summary
SAP Intercompany helps companies reconcile intercompany balances without 
extra work and delays at the corporate and divisional levels. According to data 
provided by our customers, those that deploy this application on an open tech­
nology platform alongside their financial consolidation system experience the fol­
lowing benefits:
 Improved accuracy of intercompany transactions
 Reduced length of reporting cycles
 Freed up finance staff and resources, giving them more time to analyze data, 
not just gather and reconcile it
 Quick implementation (in some cases, in as little as two weeks) at relatively 
low cost
In this chapter, we learned how it’s possible to complement your consolidation 
engine and finance staff with the SAP Intercompany application. In our next 
chapter, we will review financial consolidation tools.

Financial consolidation involves collecting data from each subsidiary and 
reporting entity within an organization and adding it together. Where it 
begins to get interesting is when you get beyond aggregation to other cal­
culations, including currency, ownership, and eliminations. Streamlining 
and automating these process eliminates errors and provides information 
faster enabling more time for analysis and better decision making. This 
chapter discusses challenges surrounding consolidation and how to man­
age them.

Financial Consolidation
The following three-step general formula was first discussed in Chapter 3. Soft­
ware in its simplest form is put stuff in, do stuff and get stuff out, as outlined in 
Figure 9.1. The financial consolidation process is the middle “do stuff” step.
In more detailed terms, financial consolidation is the process organizations must 
go through to create consolidated financial statements. Companies have opera­
tions, divisions, and subsidiaries in different locations. Financial data needs to be 
collected, processed, and reported to create a top-level set of consolidated 
reports. These reports are required for many reasons, both external and internal. 
Externally, governments and industries have reporting requirements for regula­
tory and tax purposes. Internally, management requires not only consolidated 
statements but also the detail that supports the totals. While the basic concept of 
consolidation is all about aggregation, the real value comes from the analysis of 
disaggregation. Being able to understand where the totals come from enables 
leaders to make decisions that affect the future of the organization.

Organizations consolidate on the basis of customer-defined consolidation units. 
Consolidation units are typically legal entities or reporting units that are some­
times geographically based. Consolidation units can also represent, for example, 
companies, plants, business areas, profit centers, and cost centers.
Chapter 3 covered the basics of “putting data in.” In this chapter, we will discuss 
loading data to a consolidation application and then “doing stuff,” such as consol­
idations and calculations, including percent of ownership calculations. (Chapter 11
will cover the last element of Figure 9.1 which is “getting stuff out.”)
Figure 9.2 provides a simplified look at consolidation applications. In this chap­
ter, we will of course build upon this simplified approach and look first at data 
collection, then processing the data, and finally the consolidation solutions that 
can best serve finance organizations.
Since consolidation requirements are not one size fits all, SAP has several consol­
idation solutions.

SAP EPM solutions provide usability, little dependence on IT, more flexibility and 
enhanced reporting capabilities. Section 9.3 will discuss the differences in the dif­
ferences between the solutions in more detail.
The following sections will discuss the different requirements and considerations 
for a financial consolidation and how software solutions can automate and stan­
dardize as many processes.
9.1
Data Collection
Before you can effectively work on your financial consolidation, you need to look 
towards the data collection process. In this section, we will look at the various 
steps of the data collection process and considerations for your workflow and 
business process. Data collection can be broken out into several different steps. 
Along this process, you will look at what level of detail to collect, how to manage 
your approvals process for data and currency considerations. In this section, we 
will look at:
 Loading Data.
 Data Mapping.
 Identifying what level of detail to collect, referred to as Dimensionality.
 Data validation and control.
 Managing commentary associated with data.
 Identifying your workflow and the necessary approvals for data.
 Identifying the periodicity of your data.
 Currency considerations.
Chapter 3 discussed more of the technical collecting of data. This section gets 
more into the business requirements that need to be addressed as opposed to the 
more technical aspects of the earlier chapters.
Before you can collect data, you need to decide what you want to collect as shown 
in Figure 9.2. To define what to collect, you need to start by looking at what you 
want to create. What do the reports look like that will be the result of this consol­
idation process? Organizations often take reports they have used in the past as a 
start and then mock up additional reports they would like to have.

Financial Consolidation
172

After the reports are defined, then they need to be analyzed as to where the data 
comes from. The majority of data for a consolidation system comes from the Gen­
eral Ledger (GL) system(s). In certain organizations, supporting systems contain 
additional details. Consolidation applications usually have a more summarized 
level of data than transactional systems. How summarized the level should be 
needs to be defined. A cash account, for example, is made up of various bank 
accounts, but only the total is needed in a consolidation system.
If a company needs to analyze sales accounts by region, for example, it needs to 
figure out how to detail the sales accounts by region. If this type of detail is not 
available in the GL, it may be captured in a sales system.
In addition to identifying account balances, how accounts are calculated needs to 
be analyzed. If your organization allocates IT costs to different entities based on 
headcount, then you need to make sure headcounts are collected, perhaps from a 
human resources (HR) system.
As an example let’s understand how Altron implemented SAP Business Planning 
and Consolidation to bring more standardization and automation to their consol­
idation and financial reporting processes.
9.1.1
Customer Story: Altron Consolidates Financial Data to Better 
Manage Assets and Risk
Johannesburg-based Allied Electronics Corporation Limited, (Altron), has glo­
bally dispersed subsidiaries specializing in telecommunications, power electron­
ics, multimedia and IT. Each subsidiary functions separately which makes 
financial consolidation particularly challenging. The company was using a DOS-
based consolidation tool without a drill-down capability which resulted in a large 
number of manual queries between head office and the subsidiaries during year-
end that could take many weeks to resolve.
Altron recognized the need to deploy software to enable efficient consolidation of 
group-wide information with better security, standardized data sets and easier 
ways to aggregate and disseminate information. After reviewing various vendor 
solutions, Altron selected the SAP Business Planning and Consolidation applica­
tion and SAP Xcelsius Enterprise business intelligence software and worked with 
an implementation partner to install the software, train users and roll out the 
solution across the globe.

173
9.1
Today there are around 300 enterprise-wide users, all securely connected via the 
Internet, who can instantly find the information they need and quickly generate 
a report. This has helped reduce the time needed to resolve queries by 50% and 
has saved an annual US$200,000 previous spent on hiring external consultants 
needed to support the year end close. The time that the sub–holding companies 
need to close their year-end books has been reduced by a third; easier access to 
data needed for tax reports has saved 280 employee days and acquisitions can 
now be integrated in 1 or 2 days rather than 2-3 weeks.
Deeper insight has also changed the company’s practices in many ways such as 
enabling the more consistent interpretation and reporting of non-financial infor­
mation to support government hiring regulations. It has also helped Altron con­
solidate spend with key suppliers group-wide as well as providing more reliable 
information that helps the company identify its top customers across the globe so 
they we can invest in growing these key relationships.
Altron says the investment has already paid for itself many times over and is now 
looking to use the solution to enhance planning and to manage its assets and risks 
more proactively.
9.1.2
Loading Data
After the required data is identified for your consolidation system, you then need 
to identify where the data comes from, i.e. identify your source system. Is the 
source data in another software system or maintained offline, manually? If it is in 
another source system, it needs to be extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) 
into your consolidation system. There are dedicated ETL tools such as SAP Finan­
cial Information Management for this purpose as discussed in Chapter 3.
This automation of the data load is crucial to the project. The more areas you can 
eliminate manual processes from the more risk of human error you can remove. 
The automation of data load should not be taken lightly, and you should always 
budget enough time in your project to sufficiently address this topic. It is often 
under budgeted even though it is extremely critical to the success of any imple­
mentation.
In a perfect world, all data in a consolidation system would be automated. As 
mentioned, manual work introduces more chances for errors. But in certain situ­
ations, it can’t be avoided. Sometimes certain subsidiaries may have source ledger 

Financial Consolidation
174

systems that aren’t easily extracted from. Or sometimes all of the data need for a 
consolidation isn’t captured in a source system. Consolidation software should 
have the capabilities to accommodate entering data manually to deal with these 
situations. The control and validation of manual data is mandatory and discussed 
in the following sections.
9.1.3
Data Mapping/Central Chart of Accounts
Before data is consolidated, it must be standardized. It is critical that you are add­
ing like data to like data. All source systems don’t always have the same chart of 
accounts. Therefore, a central chart of accounts needs to be defined for running a 
consolidation solution. A central chart of accounts is also known as a standard or 
uniform chart of accounts. An organization reviews its reporting requirements, as 
discussed in the introduction to this section, and then identifies a chart of 
accounts to use in the consolidation system.
Source systems may use a different chart of accounts. GL systems will be at a 
more granular level. Certain subsidiaries may use different systems with different 
charts that need to be mapped. The mapping process involves laying each chart 
side by side and reviewing, account by account, how they match up to each other.
This process can be very time-consuming the first time, but after an initial map­
ping process is completed, ongoing maintenance typically includes ensuring that 
new accounts that are added to source systems are mapped appropriately. Figure 
9.3 shows the mapping screen from SAP Financial Information Management. You 
can see the GL account (GL_ACCT) as the source which maps to the target 
account.
A key step in the mapping process is to clearly document and communicate what 
is intended to be captured in each account. For example, an account called “Fix­
tures and fittings” needs to be clearly differentiated from “Office equipment.” 
“Accounts payables” must be clearly differentiated from “Intercompany accounts 
payables” or “Intercompany notes payable.” Creating this standardization is cru­
cial to ensuring consistencies across subsidiaries. The standardization creates 
integrity in your data as well as providing a standard basis for your calculations.
The challenge in this area is further complicated by international operations and 
multiple languages. It is extremely helpful to have a system that allows you to 
translate your chart of account into multiple languages.

9.1.4
Dimensionality: Identifying the Level of Detail to Collect
As mentioned earlier, identifying what data to collect for a consolidation system 
is critical. Not only do you need to analyze consolidated financial reports, but you 
also need to identify how you need to break that data down. In more specific 
terms, you need to not only aggregate and consolidate data but also disaggregate 
and break down the information. For example, every company needs to provide 
a consolidated income statement, which is an aggregation of all revenues and 
expenses from each of its reporting entities. (Aggregation is being used as a sim­
plified term here; there are accounting rules which indicate that financial consol­
idation is a bit more than just adding data together, as discussed later in Section 
9.2. But for the sake of simplicity, let’s stick with aggregation for the moment.) So 
the first step is to aggregate the data, and then comes the interesting part—disag­
gregating the data. Management sees the total numbers, but then wants to know 
how the data breaks out by country, by product, and by customer segment. Being 
able to provide that detail quickly and accurately is where a great accounting and 
financial close system comes into play.

You need to think through all of the supporting reports and ad hoc analysis you’ll 
need to perform. You then start to identify how you need to break down infor­
mation, for example, by segment, region, or department. Within a consolidation 
system, these are called dimensions, which help you create your data model.
Figure 9.4 shows an example of dimensions used in an SAP Financial Consolida­
tion solution. Note the dimensions that come standard with the application are 
indicated by an orange icon (1) and the configurable (user-defined) dimensions 
are blue (2).
One way to think about dimensions is as the axes needed for analysis. Imagine a 
financial report and think about the X and Y axis of that report. Think about what 
would be across the columns and down the rows. For example, one axis, could be 
accounts down the rows and then periods across the columns. Account and 
period are dimensions.
GLs systems often manage dimensionality with their account structure, as you 
can see in Figure 9.5.
Figure 9.4  SAP Financial Consolidation Dimension Examples

9.1
Flow Dimension
A key dimension that is typically used in EPM solutions is the flow dimension. 
Sometimes referred to as the movement dimension, this dimension is used to track 
the flow of an account through the year. Typical flows include opening balance, 
increases, decreases, and ending balance. Flows can be different from one 
account to the next; for example, the columns across the top of an equity roll for­
ward report are flows, and they are different from those flows on the balance 
sheet One of the advantages of the flow dimension is that it enables you to auto­
mate the cash flow statement.
Flow Example
Following are some examples of the flows used in the SAP IFRS starter kit described in 
Section 9.4:
 F00 Opening
 F01 Incoming units
 F06 Dividends
 F09 Change in accounting policies
 F10 Net profit (loss) for the period
 F15 Net variation
 F20 Increase/Purchase
 F30 Decrease/Disposal
 F40 Capital increase/decrease
 F50 Reclassification
 F55 Fair value
 F70 Internal mergers

 F80 Currency translation adjustment
 F92 Change in interest rate
 F98 Outgoing units
 F99 Closing
 Y99 Year to date
To be able to calculate the Statement of Cash Flow items and to produce the State­
ment of Changes in Equity, changes in the balance sheet items need to be cap­
tured or calculated as follows:
 For current assets and liabilities (gross value), the net variation can be calcu­
lated and displayed in input forms.
 For other balance sheet accounts, a detailed analysis of movements is required.
 Specific operations are identified separately for all balance sheet accounts: 
reclassification, changes in accounting policies, internal mergers (transfer of 
balance sheet accounts from the acquired to the acquiring company in case of 
an internal merger).
 Opening balances are automatically calculated from the closing balance of the 
previous year.
To capture data at this level, it either needs to be loaded from a source system or 
entered manually. If only an opening and ending balance are available, input 
schedules can be created to collect the additional detail. Figure 9.6 shows an 
example of a data input schedule for collecting flow data for property, plant, and 
equipment.

9.1.5
Data Validation and Control
Data coming into a consolidation application must be intelligently checked and 
filtered based on the reporting framework and rules defined by the central 
finance team. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) presentation, required information 
breakdowns, starting dates, and ending dates can serve as automatic checkpoints 
to ensure data quality at every level of a corporate reporting cycle. This way, the 
incoming information respects the timing and expected format. Data must be 
consistent, complete, and commented appropriately, and go through the right 
auditable approval process.
Certain accounting principles must be checked, such as assets equaling liabilities 
plus equity. You may be collecting certain details from one system such as a sales 
system and totals from another, so you need to check that the totals equal the 
detail. SAP EPM consolidation solutions allow you to automate these types of 
controls.
Another aspect of control is managed through security. Different users are pro­
vided with different types of access to a system (see Figure 9.7).
Figure 9.7  User Access

Financial Consolidation
180

SAP EPM solutions allow you to assign functional profiles and data access profiles 
to each user. A functional profile defines what they have access to do (e.g., post a 
journal entry, change a report, run a consolidation); a data access profile defines 
what level of data they have access to (e.g. only local entity data, all of North 
America data, all XYZ Division data). This type of security helps you maintain con­
trol over the consolidation process.
9.1.6
Collecting Commentary with Data
You may also want to control the amount of commentary that is provided with 
your data. For example, if there is a more than 10% increase over last year, you 
may want your subsidiaries to provide comments as to why that information is 
relevant.
Part of creating financial reports is including a management discussion and anal­
ysis (MD&A) section. Here the management of an organization discusses the 
financial results that have been reported. Corporate therefore needs to collect this 
detail from its subsidiaries.
SAP EPM consolidation solutions enable you to collect text as well as numerical 
data. Combining financial data with comments into a publishable report can be 
accomplished with SAP Disclosure Management, discussed in Chapter 10.
9.1.7
Workflow and Approval of Data
After data has been checked, consolidation software solutions help provide 
accountability. Often a local accountant is responsible for providing the data to be 
collected and then a local controller or CFO is responsible for reviewing the data 
that was compiled and then signing off on that data electronically. SAP EPM con­
solidation solutions not only track the electronic sign-off but also provide a 
detailed audit trail of who signed off on it and on what date at what time.
SAP EPM consolidation applications enable you to monitor and record the perfor­
mance of the various contributors to the close process. It’s long been said that 
what gets measured, gets managed—and that is just as true for the close process 
as for any other activity. By publishing statistics on the best and worst performers 
in the close process and by coaching and training in areas identified as weak, you 
make the process a managed one, increase discipline, and carry out significant 
improvements to the close time.

Consolidation monitors are available to provide corporate a view of the status for 
each reporting entity and how they roll up. Figure 9.8 shows the BPC Consolida­
tion Monitor. You can see each business unit listed along with its Control Sta­
tus (as discussed in Section 9.1.5), Work Status, Currency Translation, and 
Consolidation. Notice that the statuses roll up into each Sub Scope and the total 
so the user can get a clear view of the status for groups of entities.
9.1.8
Periodicity of Data (Collecting Year to Date versus Periodic)
Financial reports are a snapshot in time of the financial position of an organiza­
tion. The balances of each account, on the day of the snapshot, are reported. Dif­
ferent companies have different requirements or processes that they follow in 
this area. EPM consolidation solutions have the flexibility to accommodate differ­
ent requirements that also vary based on the type of report or financial statement. 
Typically, all companies want visibility to month-to-date, quarter-to-date, and 
year-to-date amounts. This is referred to as the periodicity of data.
Figure 9.8  SAP Business Planning and Consolidation: Consolidation Monitor

Financial Consolidation
182

A consolidation system needs to capture the ending balance of all accounts on the 
balance sheet and the year-to-date amount on the P&L statements. This can be 
accomplished in many ways. Let’s discuss two options most widely used by orga­
nizations: loading ending balances and calculating ending balances.
 Loading ending balances
In a consolidation system, typically the ending balance is loaded for accounts 
on the balance sheet/statement of financial position. The opening balance is 
rolled forward in the consolidation system, and the ending balance is loaded 
from the GL system. Any activity between the opening and ending is recorded 
using the flow dimension discussed in Section 9.1.4.
 Calculating ending balances
The accounts on the P&L statement are typically loaded as month-to-date val­
ues, and then all months are added together to get the year-to-date value.
9.1.9
Currency (Local, Transaction, Group)
For consolidation purposes, data is typically collected in the local currency of 
each entity, (e.g., French subsidiaries report euros, United States in US dollars, 
and Japan in yen.) The local currency is typically calculated into a group reporting 
currency for standardization purposes. Sometimes, organizations have more than 
one group currency if they have regulatory or management reporting require­
ments in multiple regions.
Transaction currency refers to the specific currency used during an individual 
transaction. For example, a British company has two subsidiaries: one in Paris 
(subsidiary A) and one in Miami (subsidiary B). The Paris entity sends the Miami 
entity an invoice in euros for goods provided.
The currencies for these two subsidiaries are represented in Table 9.1.

Consolidation systems may capture transaction data for purposes of intercom­
pany reconciliation, but typically they capture local and group currency for all 
accounts.
As such, different currency exchange rates need to be collected, and different 
types of rates are required to be collected. Figure 9.9 shows an example of a cur­
rency rate table from SAP Financial Consolidation.
The currency conversion calculation is discussed in Section 9.2.6.
Now that we have discussed all of the options for data collection and how to opti­
mize this process, we’ll shift focus and review how to process the data collected, 
including managing organizational structures and making consolidation adjust­
ments—both manual and automatic. From the three-step process discussed at the 
beginning of this chapter, in Figure 9.1, let’s move from the “Put stuff in” to the 
“Do stuff” Step with a discussion of processing the data that we have now col­
lected.
9.2
Processing Data
Because the industrialization of the close process is key to a successful fast close, 
the ability to automate as many processes as possible is extremely advantageous. 
Built-in financial intelligence can further speed the close cycle. Built-in rules logic 
can automate consolidation entries. Currency translation adjustments, minority 
interest and equity calculations, intercompany reconciliations, and automatic

cash flows can be set up through a standard user interface and intuitive wizards. 
SAP EPM consolidation solutions have dedicated modules to manage business 
rules, calculations, and ownership structures.
The ability to automate and standardize as many processes as possible is 
extremely advantageous to the financial close process. SAP EPM consolidation 
solutions speed the close cycle by using built-in rules logic to automate consolida­
tion entries. They can handle multiple reporting channels with different charts of 
accounts and different account flows or analysis dimensions over time. They can 
also manage the retention of past reporting frameworks so finance professionals 
can safely adapt to ever-changing financial needs without having to copy and 
paste, rebuild, or destroy their previous reporting scenarios. In the following sec­
tions, we will look at how to manage organizational structures, make consolida­
tion adjustments, and handle intercompany eliminations.

Customer Story: HMY Group Enables More Comprehensive and 
Up-to-Date Reporting with SAP Financial Consolidation
Headquartered at Monétau in the Burgundy region of France, the HMY Group 
provides design and shop-fitting services for retailers across the globe, helping 
them create efficient and attractive shopping experiences for their customers.
Through the know-how and experiences of a number of different companies that 
have been acquired over the years, the company has a presence in over 50 coun­
tries and needed to improve the way it consolidated financial data collected from 
multiple global sources more efficiently as it sought to further expand into new 
markets. Previously the company was only able to produce balance sheets every 
quarter and providing better monthly reporting to management so they had bet­
ter insight into the financial performance of the group was paramount. So too 
was improving the traceability of financial information that resulted from inter-
company trading between the growing number of subsidiaries that make up the 
group.
Attracted by its simplicity and proven market credentials, HMY Group deployed 
the SAP Financial Consolidation application, actively involving various business 
users across the globe to help define solution requirements with the emphasis 
being on delivering a standardized accounting and financial reporting processes 
that could be automated as much as possible.

Once rolled out the new solution quickly delivered tangible benefits. The time 
taken to consolidate month end data was increased by a factor of four and overall 
the time spent on the monthly financial consolidation cycle was cut by 25%. 
Automating and speeding up the month end processes enabled more detailed and 
frequent balance sheets to be produced, something that was not feasible with the 
previous solution. And as many reports, such as cash flow statements, were now 
automatically generated, the finance team can provide the business with more 
reliable and comprehensive financial reporting.
Overall, reporting is faster and more efficient; the group has greater transparency 
across the various subsidiaries and managers have more comprehensive informa­
tion to support their business decisions.
9.2.2
Managing Organizational Structures
Organizational structures refer to how different entities roll up within an organi­
zation. It is important to have a tool that meets the requirements associated with 
organizational structure. The organizational structure refers not only to the legal 
reporting unit roll up, but in some cases, there are reporting units under a legal 
entity. SAP Business Planning and Consolidation has an ownership manager 
whereas SAP Financial Consolidation manages ownership structures in the Scope 
module.
In a situation in which most entities are owned 100%, and there is little merger, 
acquisition, and disposal activity, a consolidation system is not necessarily re­
quired to manage the ownership structure. Changes in organizational structure 
can be easily accommodated with manual journal entries.
However, when there is much merger, acquisition, and disposition activity, as well
as internal reorganizations, a sophisticated consolidation solution is required. All 
SAP consolidation solutions can handle complex organization structures.
This book is not meant to be a comprehensive accounting guide, so specific 
accounting detail is light, but rather we address the high-level principles, includ­
ing which entities to consolidate and at what percentage, the cost method, the 
equity method, and majority-owned approaches.

Which Entities to Consolidate at What Percentages
Part of the consolidation process involves identifying which entities to consoli­
date at what percentages. Direct and indirect ownership need to be taken into 
consideration. Consider the organizational structure shown in Figure 9.10.
In Figure 9.10, you can see that A directly owns 50% of B, and B owns 80% of D. 
A therefore has a 40% indirect ownership in D. This is a simple example, but you 
can imagine the complexity in which entities own a percentage of other entities 
as is possible in some countries.
The percentage at which entities are consolidated determines the method for con­
solidation. Standard thresholds along with consolidation methods are listed in 
Table 9.2.
As we have mentioned, different countries have different regulatory require­
ments. These requirements may cause foreign entities to make adjustments to 
comply with local GAAP. Companies have the option with consolidation systems 
to run different consolidation versions based on different regulations or make

either automated or manuals adjustment to manage the different reporting 
requirements. Let’s look at the different consolidation methods shown in Table 
9.2 in further detail.
Cost Method
The cost method is used when the investor holds too small a share of the entity’s 
equity (usually < 20%) to have any influence or control over the company. Invest­
ment is recorded at cost at the time of purchase. There is typically no need for 
adjustments to the investment except for extenuating circumstances:
 Dividends declared exceed earnings of the company.
 Permanent decline in the value of the company.
Typically, the GL data for an entity that is < 20% owned is not required or used as 
part of the consolidation.
Equity Method
The equity method is used whenever the investor has significant influence over 
the investee, such as the following:
 Typically 20–50% owned.
 Can make exceptions for < 20% or > 50%.
The investment is recorded at the original cost. The investment is increased with 
income and decreased with dividends from the subsidiary. It is also common to 
have purchase differentials, such as the following:
 Difference in fair market value of assets and cost of the investment (i.e., good­
will).
 Difference between fair market value of assets and book value.
A company may or may not require/use GL data from entities that are less than 
50% owned.
Majority Owned
Majority owned is used when the investor owns > 50% of an entity. Majority-
owned entities must be consolidated into the parent company’s consolidated

financial results. The part of the subsidiary’s income/balances not owned by the 
parent company is booked to minority interest:
 Minority interest is typically an expense (right before net income) that reduces 
net income on the income statement (assuming a profitable subsidiary).
 Minority interest is typically a liability that increases the liabilities of the con­
solidated company on the balance sheet.
SAP EPM consolidation solutions make automatic calculations based on how the 
organizational hierarchy is defined within the system. Figure 9.11 shows the 
ownership manager in SAP Business Planning and Consolidation. This built-in 
financial intelligence helps to streamline the whole consolidation process.

Consolidation Adjustments
The previous section discussed consolidation calculations that are impacted by an 
organization’s ownership structure. The basis of the consolidation is how it rolls 
up. There are, however, many other calculations that occur during the financial 
consolidation process. Let’s continue to discuss those here. Consolidation adjust­
ments are made during the consolidation process. Within a consolidation system, 
there is an electronic record of everything that happens to a piece of data from the 
time it is collected to the time it is disclosed. SAP EPM consolidation solutions 
typically have a dedicated dimension called Audit ID or Data Source to track all 
adjustments to any account. (See Section 9.1.3 where we discussed dimensional­
ity.) Having this dimension makes it extremely easy to report how a number 
changes though the course of consolidation. There are two types of adjustments—
manual adjustments and automatic adjustments—which are covered in the fol­
lowing subsections.
Manual Adjustments
Often called top-side adjustments, manual adjustments are journal entries that 
are posted to the consolidation system directly. As discussed, data flows from the 
GL to the consolidation system. Corporate may want to make adjustments to the 
data manually for various reasons. They may realize one of their subsidiaries mis­
classified an amount, and in the interest of time, it is easier to book a manual 
adjustment than to re-collect data from that entity. That entity would book the 
adjustment in the next period, and the manual journal entry would be reversed in 
the next period. Manual entries can also be permanent such as differences 
between local and corporate reporting standards.
The IT landscape sometimes dictates the management of manual journals within 
a consolidation system. If companies have one instance of a GL system, they may 
make manual adjustments within the consolidation system. In that case, they 
need to post the adjustment in the GL system and then reload the data from the 
source system.
If journal entries are allowed, there is often security limiting who can create jour­
nals and who can post them within the consolidation system. Figure 9.12 shows 
a screenshot of the manual journal entry screen.

Automatic Adjustments
Automatic adjustments are calculations that are defined within a consolidation 
application. SAP EPM consolidation applications use business rules to allow users 
to define what calculations need to automated during the consolidation process.
Any time there is a pattern, logic, or a constant formula to a specific adjustment, 
there is the opportunity to automate an adjustment. As discussed, any opportu­
nity to automate helps speed the close process. Additionally there will be an elec­
tronic trail of the adjustment, including why it was made and the logic behind it. 
Remember, less manual intervention leads to fewer errors.
Figure 9.13 shows the list of rules used in the IFRS starter kit discussed in Section 
9.4. Some of those are discussed in more detail in the following sections.
9.2.4
Intercompany Eliminations
Chapter 8 explains how intercompany reconciliation is a key element in the con­
solidation process. Many organizations leverage consolidation systems to recon­
cile intercompany balances. Corporate first collects all of the intercompany 
information from its subsidiaries and then identifies where the accounts are out 
of balance. For example, entity A says its accounts receivables amount from B is 
Figure 9.12  SAP Financial Consolidation: Manual Journal Entry Screen

Processing Data
191
9.2
100, but entity B says its accounts payable amount to A is 150. SAP consolidation 
systems provide reconciliation reports that call out these out of balances. But to 
find out why there is a difference (an accounting mistake, timing differences, 
etc.), you need to go back to the entities. The entities then look at the transac­
tional detail (which isn’t normally captured in a consolidation system) and correct 
the errors.
After intercompany data has been reconciled, it then needs to be eliminated. In 
the preceding example, let’s assume they finally agreed that the account balance 
should be 100. These amounts need to be eliminated on the consolidated finan­
cial statements. If these amounts are not eliminated, the accounts payable and 
accounts receivable amounts will be overstated by 100 each.
Elimination of intercompany activity can be automated with all SAP EPM consol­
idation solutions.
See Section 9.4 for more details on the starter kits, including SAP EPM consolida­
tion kits, SAP Disclosure Management consolidation kits and SAP Rapid Deploy­
ment Solutions (RDS).

9.2.5
Elimination of Investments
Similar to the elimination of intercompany discussed in the previous section, 
investments in subsidiaries need to be eliminated so as not to double count them 
in the consolidated financial statements.
The different consolidation methods each require a different adjustment. Many 
organizations calculate these adjustments offline in a spreadsheet and then book a 
manual journal entry to account for the adjustments. SAP EPM consolidation soft­
ware has functionality called business rules, which can help automate and stream­
line these types of calculations and reduce the amount of manual interaction.
9.2.6
Foreign Currency Conversion and Currency Translation 
Adjustments
There are several currency conversion rules that you should consider when han­
dling intercompany eliminations and foreign currencies. Best practices config­
ured in the starter kits discussed in Section 9.4 include:
 The income statement accounts are converted using the average rate of the 
reporting period.
 Accounts in the statement of financial position are converted using the period-
end rate, except for investments and equity accounts, which are maintained at 
their historical acquisition value.
 Balance sheet movements are translated using the average rate. For equity 
accounts, the currency translation differences are recorded in a dedicated 
account in the reserves.
 Because some transaction values need to be converted at a specific rate, such as 
dividends distribution and the balance sheet position of incoming units, the 
definition of currency rate per company is required.
 All values are translated cumulated, meaning that the year-to-date value for the 
closing period is translated using the rate of the same closing period.
The currency conversion rules in the preceding list also apply to accounts for 
additional analyses.
As explained previously, equity accounts are translated using the historical value 
method. When running the consolidation for one given consolidation scope for 
the first time, the historical values of these accounts must be recorded as well as 

Processing Data

9.2
the cumulated amount of the conversion reserves as part of the preparatory tasks. 
This can be done in one of two ways:
 By importing the converted opening balance on the opening flow directly at 
the converted level on a technical prior year-end time period used for opening 
data, and defining entity-specific exchange rates for this technical consolida­
tion. The opening rate, the average rate, and the closing rate should be identi­
cal so that no currency conversion difference is computed on this time period.
 By posting a journal entry to return to the historical translation amount.
9.2.7
Rounding
Rounding may be one of the most annoying things about financial accounting. 
What sounds like a very small detail can sometimes create a lot of work. Let’s start 
by giving an example as listed in Table 9.3.
When the numbers that need to be reported are in millions or billions of a cur­
rency, the numbers are rounded for presentation purposes. As you can see in the 
example in Table 9.3, if you simply round all of the balances in the left column, 
the sum is rounded to 300,951, where the actual sum of the rounded balance is 
actually 300,950.
Financial statements are a reflection of an organization; as such, it is important 
not to have errors in your financials. So by simply rounding all of the balances on 
a report can create an error.
SAP EPM consolidation solutions ease the challenges of rounding. You can easily 
divide consolidated data by 1,000 and then run reports that calculate totals based 
on the rounded data.

9.2.8
Workflow and Approval of Adjustments
As discussed in Section 9.1.8 for data collection, work flow and approval of 
adjustments is important. The beauty of using software is that it automates calcu­
lations for you, tracing all of the steps along the way. Manual entries, however, 
need to be controlled. Often organizations put a policy in place where the person 
who creates a journal doesn’t have the authority to post a journal entry. This 
ensures that there at least two sets of eyes on a manual journal entry to eliminate 
mistakes.
SAP EPM consolidation software allows for this type of security and eases approv­
als by making them an electronic signature.
9.2.9
Consolidation Versions
Different versions of consolidated data are often necessary. The next sections 
describe some requirements that call for different consolidation versions. SAP 
EPM consolidation solutions allows for multiple versions for different purposes 
to address multiple GAAPs, IFRS, currency impacts, modeling scenarios, and re­
porting requirements.
Multiple GAAPs
GAAPs vary geographically and can be specific to a specific industry. As globaliza­
tion becomes the norm, organizations are required to report financial informa­
tion to comply with more than one GAAP.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
IFRS is being adopted by more and more countries. In the map shown in Figure 
9.14, you can see which countries have adopted the new standards. Because stan­
dardization within an organization can help speed the close process, standardiz­
ing reporting requirements makes financial reporting easier for multinational 
companies and facilitates the global economy.
The broad reach of IFRS touches many corporate systems, including Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP) and Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) solu­
tions. The impact of the change is often most significant on financial systems, 
especially on group financial reporting practices.

Processing Data
195
9.2
Isolating Currency Impacts
Having the ability to isolate the impacts due to changes in exchange rates versus 
organic change can be challenging. Being able to run different versions of a con­
solidation based on different rates allows you to easily calculate the variances.
Consider comparing this year’s actual numbers to those of last year. If you run 
this year’s actuals at this year’s rates, and then run another consolidation version 
at last year’s rates, you can then take the difference between the versions to iso­
late the difference. An example of the resulting report is shown in Figure 9.15.
Modeling What-if Scenarios for Mergers and Acquisitions
Organizational structures change often as companies are merged or acquisitions 
occur. For example, for year-over-year reporting, you will want to see what 
growth happened from acquisitions and what organic growth occurred. Consoli­
dation software that can support that type of reporting is essential.

In addition to comparing this year to last year, you may also want to do what-if 
scenarios and various modeling to see the potential impact on your financials if a 
merger or acquisition occurred.
Management versus Legal Reporting Requirements
By combining legal and management reporting structures, SAP EPM consolida­
tion solutions let you consolidate and directly compare all possible views in one 
fully integrated data model. This helps ensure a single version of the truth—with­
out tedious, low-value reconciliations—and helps you focus on activities that add 
value to your business. The software also provides side-by-side what-if simula­
tions for key growth initiatives, such as organizational changes, mergers, or 
acquisitions.

Differentiation between Consolidation Solutions
As we have discussed, SAP has several consolidation solutions. All of these solu­
tions are now supported by SAP development. At the time of printing, all SAP

consolidation solutions will be supported until 2020. Each solution has many cus­
tomers, small and large, who perform complex multinational, multi-GAAP con­
solidations. The available solutions are:
 SAP Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) solutions:
 SAP Business Planning and Consolidation, version for Netweaver
 SAP Business Planning and Consolidation, version for Microsoft
 SAP Financial Consolidation
 Classic Solutions (part of the SAP Business Suite):
 Strategic Enterprise Management – Business Consolidation (SEM-BCS)
 Enterprise Controlling – Consolidation System (EC-CS)
Because financial consolidation requirements differ greatly from one organiza­
tion to the next, SAP has more than one solution to meet varied types of require­
ments. SAP acquired Outlooksoft (and BPC) in 2007 to help the office of the CFO 
innovate in the area of enterprise performance management (EPM). In 2008 SAP 
acquired SAP Financial Consolidation through the Business Objects acquisition. 
SAP developed Strategic Enterprise Management—Business Consolidation (SEM-
BCS) as part of the SAP Business Suite. Each of these solutions is discussed in 
more detail in the following sections and the differences between them.
9.3.1
Business Suite Solutions
SAP Enterprise Controlling-Consolidation (EC-CS) is Consolidation and Simula­
tion in ECC 6.0. Strategic Enterprise Management Business Consolidation (SEM-
BCS) is the technological successor of EC-CS. EC-CS is based on R/3 where as SEM 
BCS is based on BW. Both these solutions perform financial consolidations. Con­
solidation logic is developed, delivered, and maintained by SAP. SAP will only 
address product issues and legal changes in EC-CS. There are no plans to add func­
tional enhancements to EC-CS.
There are very few new BCS and EC-CS implementations since the EPM solutions 
provide better usability, little dependence on IT, more flexibility, and enhanced 
reporting capabilities. That being said, there are many BCS customer who are 
happy and the product continues to be enhanced.

Differences between Business Suite and EPM solutions
Business Suite and EPM solutions have different “philosophies.” As illustrated in 
Figure 9.16, SAP EPM solutions use a “rules based” approach versus the precon­
figured approach for the BCS & EC-CS. With the preconfigured approach, SAP 
develops and maintains the consolidation logic in the system. In the event that 
customers have requirements that go beyond what is delivered ABAP programing 
and technical intervention is required.
SAP EPM solutions on the other hand have “business rule modules” which allow 
finance or business users to create new calculations by creating business rules 
which require simpler configuration rather than programming. This brings more 
flexibility and autonomy: customers depend less on SAP delivering new function­
ality when wanting to extend the business logic. Customers can cover their 
requirements by adding or changing consolidation rules. Customers can react 
more quickly to changes in accounting rules where with the pre-defined logic 
approach it is necessary to often wait on support or even potentially new 
enhancement packages before the changes can be delivered.

SAP Business Planning and Consolidation (BPC)
SAP Business Planning and Consolidation (BPC), as stated previously, is part of 
the EPM suite of products by SAP. BPC accelerates planning and consolidated 
financial reporting processes. It supports planning, budgeting, and forecasting 
capabilities with management and legal consolidation functionality in a single 
application. You can quickly adjust plans and forecasts, shorten budget cycle 
time, close the books more quickly, help ensure compliance with regulatory and 
financial standards, and get the information you need to make more confident 
decisions. The BPC application has had several naming changes, and to clarify the 
BPC solution, let’s look at its history:
 1999 Foundation of Outlooksoft and Launch Everest.
 2007 SAP acquires Outlooksoft.
 2007 Launch SAP Business Planning and Consolidation.
 2008 Launch SAP Business Planning and Consolidation 7.0, version for 
NetWeaver & SAP Business Planning and Consolidation 7.0, version for 
Microsoft.
 2011 Launch EPM 10.0, including SAP Business Planning and Consolidation 
10.0, version for SAP NetWeaver and SAP Business Planning and Consolida­
tion 10.0, version for Microsoft.
Outlooksoft was created by former Hyperion employees. BPC was the result of 
the desire to create an innovative, easy to use performance management solution 
to cover both planning and consolidation. Figure 9.17 shows the Start page of 
BPC 10.0. What differentiates BPC from other consolidation applications is its 
unified planning and consolidation capabilities. It has a Microsoft Excel interface 
that is easy to use and familiar for finance professionals and includes business 
process flows which allow customers a guided approach to different finance pro­
cesses.

As an example of a BPC implementation, let's look at Russian Railways who 
implemented BPC for both planning and consolidation.

Customer Story: Russian Railways Gets On the Right Track with 
Planning and Consolidation
Carrying just short of one trillion passengers a year and with nearly a million 
employees, Russian Railways (RZD) is one of the largest transport companies in 
the world moving people and freight across two continents from Beijing to Berlin 
along 85,500 kilometers of track.
Born out of the loss making Ministry of Railways of the Russian Federation in 
2003, new management instilled a culture of commercial accountability and 
brought the company into profit. To continue this transformation, management 
recognized the need to standardize planning and budgeting systems across the 
various subsidiaries, shortening planning and re-forecasting cycles as they were 
not able to keep in step with operational changes and speeding up consolidation 
processes to provide quicker and more reliable information to support decision 
making.
Figure 9.17  SAP Business Planning and Consolidation Landing Page

Differentiation between Consolidation Solutions

9.3
After choosing the SAP Business Planning and Consolidation application, RZD 
joined the SAP Ramp-Up program, which provides dedicated expertise for the 
implementation of new versions of SAP software, as this would accelerate the 
time to value in what was to be a mammoth implementation. Given the diversity 
of businesses within the group, RZD chose to implement several instances of the 
software in order to support different methods of planning and budgeting, all the 
time ensuring that data automation projects were in place to unify the data at the 
highest levels.
The central finance team joke that the implementation of SAP Business Planning 
and Consolidation was a ‘smooth ride’. It has certain delivered important benefits 
and thanks to the software, RZD can now run their once-slow processes much 
faster, much easier and with much greater flexibility. The time taken to complete 
a planning and budgeting cycle has been halved and productivity in the account­
ing and finance team increased by 30%, while automation has meant that there 
are now 60% fewer errors in routine financial processes. Given that there is still 
a considerable amount of manual data entry from remote contributors—another 
reason why the user-friendly and familiar Microsoft Excel like interface of SAP 
Planning and Consolidation appealed to RZD—this is considered a remarkable 
improvement.
9.3.4
SAP Financial Consolidation
To meet strict regulatory consolidation and reporting requirements, organiza­
tions need an application that gives control to the finance office yet is flexible 
enough for subsidiaries. The SAP Financial Consolidation application provides 
you with the power, agility, and confidence to close your books quickly.
Similiar to that of BPC, SAP Financial Consolidation has had a varied history. The 
SAP Financial Consolidation application came to SAP through the following his­
tory:

 1991 Launch Unification (see version naming note for more detail)
 1995 Launch Cartesis Carat (see version naming note for more detail)

The following customer story explains how Belgian company Bekaert leverage 
SAP Financial Consolidation to increase automation, reducing manual processes 
throughout their organization.
9.3.5
Customer Story: Bekaert Standardizes Global Financial 
Reporting
Belgium’s Bekaert is a market leader in drawn steel wire products and metal tech­
nologies. The company conducts business on a global basis and must adhere to 
the evolving International Financial Reporting Standards. In recent years, a grow­
ing number of Bekaert business units have been running on SAP software plat­
forms. However this was not in a globally standardized way and the company’s 
transactional systems and financial reporting solution were not fully integrated 
which meant that the finance team had to manually manage fragmented financial 
information from different parts of the world.
To optimize its financial reporting processes, Bekaert turned to the SAP Financial 
Consolidation application, which besides offering the functionality and level of 
integration the company demanded, was the logical choice as it fitted in with 
Bekaert’s “SAP unless” IT strategy.  To drive the implementation effort, Bekaert 
built a strong project team made up from representatives from across the com­
pany supported by IT partner Tata Consultancy Services and SAP solutions con­
sultants.
During the project, the team focused on migrating historical data and on the cru­
cial task of training 170 local users scattered around the globe. Bekaert also took 
the opportunity to enhance the company’s existing SAP ERP application platform 
to optimize integration with the financial consolidation software. Then, prior to 
the full-scale rollout, the team conducted test runs for local users and at the cen­
tral location in Bekaert’s Group Control.
Today, Bekaert is running the same financial reporting software at all its world­
wide locations and joint ventures and can collect its far-flung data more effi­
ciently with greater transparency, accuracy, and speed. Improved efficiency has 
enabled Bekaert to reduce the time taken for a quarterly financial consolidation 
by 30% which has given financial controllers across the company time to perform 
broader and more value-added analysis.

The solution’s high degree of automation also means no more manual data entry 
errors, more accurate data, and less time spent on manual processes. In fact, up to 
80% of the financial input is now automatically uploaded. Further time savings 
have been realized as a result of tight integration between the company’s transac­
tional systems and financial reporting software. This has enabled Bekaert to 
report its full-year results a month earlier than usual, even though much data had 
to be restated to comply with new reporting requirements.
9.3.6
Engaging with SAP experts
The first step in deciding which consolidation solution is a best fit for your orga­
nization is to engage SAP experts. There is not simple decision tree to help you 
decide. There are many aspects that need to be considered including but not lim­
ited to:
 Will the application be owned and maintained by IT or Finance? What are the 
skill sets of your IT and Finance department?
 Is the organization on one SAP ERP, multiple SAP ERP instances, or are there 
non-SAP ERPs involved in the landscape?
 Is there a desire to have unified planning an consolidation?
 Is there much merger and acquisition activities?
 Is the organizational hierarchy very complex? Is there a requirement for many 
different organizational hierarchies?
All these questions need to be considered and discussed both internally within 
your business and with SAP experts to select the appropriate consolidation solu­
tion.
9.4
Starter Kits
Now that you understand the different consolidation solutions from SAP and the 
processes that they help streamline, let’s discuss content. SAP provides preconfig­
ured content for its EPM consolidation solutions called starter kits. The content 
includes data entry schedules, output reports, preconfigured business rules, con­
trols, and validations.

Starter Kits
205
9.4
At the time of publication, the following starter kits are available:
A starter kit is available for IFRS. The globalization of capital markets calls for the 
convergence of accounting standards around the world. Today, more than 120 
countries allow the use of IFRS in one form or another.
Countries who have not yet adopted IFRS, such as China, are working to converge 
accounting standards. The United States will continue to converge US GAAP for 
existing projects, moving the world toward a global use of a single set of account­
ing and consolidation rules.
SAP has a regulatory task force comprised of members of the SAP Business Suite 
and EPM organizations, which monitor financial standards. Its mission is to 
deliver analysis notes describing foreseen impacts on the products. The task 
force’s focus areas vary according to the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB) work plan; for example, topics such as revenue recognition, finan­
cial statements, consolidation, financial instruments, leases, or fair value mea­
surement are at the top of the agenda. Analysis papers and notes are publicly 
available on the SAP Community Network (SCN).
The starter kit provides a design documentation you can use during the project 
implementation. It also contains process guidance for business users to achieve 
IFRS-compliant consolidation and minimize the effort needed to address complex 
requirements, such as those involving incoming entities, additional acquisition of 
shares, financial interest, or comprehensive income. Using the documentation 
provided with the starter kit can help you reduce your total cost of ownership for 
the SAP application. Because your users can immediately use these documents, 
you can eliminate the effort needed to document processes and software func­
tionality.

for IFRS. These guides are available on SCN.
The SAP EPM consolidation starter kits are developed based on extensive product 
expertise as well as the experiences of helping hundreds of customers deploy and 
configure solutions. Starter kits can help you perform, validate, and publish a stat­
utory consolidation in accordance with IFRS or US GAAP. The starter kit relies on 
a generic and IFRS/US GAAP-oriented chart of accounts, using characteristics that 
enable you to update automatically all configuration elements related to the 
accounts. The starter kits contain prebuilt data entry schedules and associated 
controls. The consolidation engine handles full, proportionate, and equity meth­
ods, and addresses scope changes. A comprehensive set of consolidation rules 
enables you to produce consistent consolidated data. Finally, the starter kit pro­
vides a complete audit trail and formatted financial statements. Your deployment 
team can then enhance the foundation to meet your individual requirements, 
such as accounting policies, business processes, or company structure.

Now that we understand what is included in a starter kit, let see how Bank of 
Cyprus leveraged the SAP Financial Consolidation starter kit for IFRS to improve 
their consolidation process.
9.4.1
Customer Story: Bank of Cyprus Group Achieves Clear Audits 
with SAP Solutions
Bank of Cyprus Group, the leading provider of financial services in Cyprus, oper­
ates nearly 600 branches in Cyprus, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, the Chan­
nel Islands, and the United Kingdom. Over recent years, the bank has expanded 
through organic growth and acquisition. This, plus a changing corporate struc­
ture, created a highly complex system for consolidated financial reporting. The 
complexity increased over time as more demanding reporting requirements were 
introduced by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and other 
industry-relevant regulators.
Previously consolidated reporting was managed with hundreds of Microsoft 
Excel spreadsheets that were shared across the bank by e-mail. This increased the 
risk of error, slowed down the process, and also cost a considerable amount of 
time and money as the bank’s finance team had to work long hours to meet its 
quarterly and year-end consolidation deadlines. Individual units from various 
countries would send spreadsheets to corporate headquarters in Cyprus, where 
data would be checked, but as many units were in different time zones, whole 
days would be lost waiting for updated data.
Recognizing the need to automate its financial consolidation process, the bank 
chose SAP Financial Consolidation based on the experience that SAP experts had 
with other European banks with accounting procedures similar to those in 
Cyprus. The bank was also attracted by a starter kit for the application that would 
help them quickly comply with the IFRS reporting requirements.
The implementation of SAP® Financial Consolidation—the first by a bank in the 
region—involved 70 users, 15 sites, 46 reporting units, and 9 countries. With the 
centralized software in place, the bank can finalize its intercompany consolida­
tions faster than before and the financial-close has been shortened from 5 to 6 
weeks down to 2 to 3 weeks.
The finance team is now freed up to analyze results, which are more accurate and 
easier for auditors and managers to review. The solution has also provided 

Financial Consolidation

managers with faster access to reports which gives them a head start on identify­
ing potential challenges and opportunities, as well as giving them access to details 
that was previously too time-consuming to produce, such as an in-depth analysis 
by region and type of business. Looking ahead, the bank hopes to give managers 
self-service dashboards to create their own reports.
9.4.2
SAP Disclosure Management Consolidation Starter Kits
SAP provides preconfigured content for SAP Disclosure Management to support 
IFRS and US GAAP. In the 2012 “Magic Quadrant for Corporate Performance 
Management Suites” report, Gartner emphasized that disclosure management 
capabilities “should support specific generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP) presentation rules to enable the preparation of statutory financial state­
ments with appropriate commentary and supplementary notes. Increasingly, 
financial-reporting solutions incorporate business rules, workflow, and audit 
trails to better meet regulatory, compliance and governance programs. In addi­
tion, they should support financial-reporting technologies, such as eXtensible 
Business Reporting Language (XBRL), as regulators increasingly require the sub­
mission of financial statements in XBRL format.” SAP Disclosure Management 
starter kits for IFRS and US GAAP leverage SAP’s core competency in solving 
business problems to improve people’s lives addressing the world’s most press­
ing challenges of regulatory complexity.
The starter kit’s preconfigured sample reports include primary financial state­
ments that comply with accounting requirements related to the presentation of 
financial statements, such as IAS1 and IAS7. Many formatting templates are deliv­
ered and ready to be adapted to your corporate policy. The statements are linked 
to the data repository, which is designed according to best practices in terms of 
table organization, data validation, dynamic formatting, and rounding manage­
ment.
From a product support perspective, SAP Disclosure Management starter kits are 
enhanced once or twice a year according to changes in regulations and made 
available on the SAP Help Portal.
SAP Disclosure Management starter kits will help you to rapidly implement your 
disclosure management application. Designing your application from the starter 
kits will provide insight on how you can leverage the powerful features of SAP

Disclosure Management for gathering, structuring, formatting, validating, tag­
ging, and eventually filing the publication data.
More specifically, US domestic filers as well as foreign private issuers will effi­
ciently comply with the US SEC mandate. Not only do the starter kits accelerate 
the creation of the mandatory reports, such as 10-Q and 20-F in HTML format, 
but the predelivered XBRL taxonomies as well as pretagged documents also help 
companies comply with the four XBRL tagging levels.
In this respect, the starter kits significantly reduce implementation times of your 
disclosure application while guiding you on your way to compliance.
The starter kits illustrate how you can pull data out of your financial reporting 
system directly into the data repository to streamline the data flow. The data-
extraction scenarios are based on SAP consolidation starter kits and can be easily 
adapted to your reporting application.
The starter kits also include custom XBRL taxonomies designed per US SEC 
requirements and based on the public IFRS and US GAAP taxonomies as 
Figure 9.20  SAP Disclosure Management Starter Kit

published by the IFRS Foundation and the FASB, respectively. The financial state­
ments are pretagged against these taxonomies to accelerate the implementation 
of your XBRL filings.
9.4.3
SAP Financial Close and Disclosure Management Rapid 
Deployment Solution (RDS)
The SAP Rapid Deployment Solution (RDS) provides a ready-to-consume combi­
nation of SAP predefined services, preconfigured content, and enablement 
content to accelerate the implementation and lower risk. The RDS takes the pre­
configured content of the starter kits described in the previous section and 
couples them with implementation services.
Implementation is supported by standardized methodology and best practices, 
honed over decades. An optimized mix of global resources, remote support, and 
onsite consulting gives you access to experts who can help you implement your 
solution on time and on budget.
The RDS includes educational material and training scripts for the functionalities 
that matter most—users start right away, without the delays associated with 
customized training. The RDS brings it all together—preconfigured software, 
fixed-scope implementation services, and the materials you need for a successful 
implementation.
The SAP Financial Close and Disclosure Management RDS streamlines the imple­
mentation process, bringing together software, best practices, and services that 
can help you quickly close the books, mitigate risk, and comply with IFRS and 
GAAP regulations. Start with what you need today, and expand your solution as 
your business requirements grow and change. SAP’s RDSs are delivered with a 
step-by-step guide that outlines the implementation process and includes SAP 
Business Planning and Consolidation, SAP Financial Consolidation, SAP Disclo­
sure Management, the related starter kits for IFRS and US GAAP, and a fixed-
scope service offering.

Summary
The financial consolidation process is one of the most involved parts of the finan­
cial close. There are complex accounting requirements combined with many

technology options that are available to streamline the process. The next chapter 
discusses SAP Disclosure Management. After all of the data is consolidated and 
calculated properly, the next question is how you present it properly to your 
stakeholders. SAP consolidation solutions have reporting tools that come with 
them, but combining that data with comments and descriptions is where SAP Dis­
closure Management comes into play.


213
After a company has completed the close, the financial results then need 
to be disclosed to internal and external stakeholders. This step is often 
called the “last mile of finance,” which refers to the publication of finan­
cial statements and regulatory disclosures. This chapter will explore 
disclosure management and XBRL filings.
10
Disclosure Management and XBRL Filings
After your company completes the financial close, the final step is to disclose the 
results to various stakeholders, including regulatory agencies, financial analysts 
and investors, and corporate executives. Examples of these disclosures include 
the publication of an annual report, quarterly results in electronic format (such as 
the 10Q form), annual results (such as the 20F form), tax disclosures (currently 
mandated in the United Kingdom), sustainability disclosures, and executive 
board packages.
For these disclosures, financial figures are supplemented with descriptive infor­
mation, which is usually in an unstructured, or free-form, format. The SAP 
Annual Report, as shown in Figure 10.1, illustrates this combination of financial 
key figures with additional narrative and graphical content.
Although many companies have automated the financial close for both the entity 
and group close, many do not have an automated way to combine their financial 
results with such narrative and other descriptive information required for finan­
cial footnotes. Instead, they rely on manual processes that involve cutting and 
pasting from various data sources and descriptions into one document, and then 
emailing the results to multiple approvers. These approvers may make contradic­
tory edits. Consequently, additional manual validations often need to be made to 
ensure the correct edits are incorporated. This increases risk because the edits and 
the audit trail are spread throughout various email inboxes.

Disclosure Management and XBRL Filings
214
10
In addition, many companies have separate work streams for creating an annual 
report and for creating electronic filings. These separate processes and data 
streams increase the risk of inconsistencies when a last-minute adjustment is 
required, for example, a final elimination entry that is made late in the consolida­
tion process. Please refer to the “Key Performance Indicators Affecting the Pro­
duction of Financial Disclosures” box for a discussion of some of the influencing 
factors of the speed and accuracy of your disclosures.
SAP Disclosure Management automates the process of managing the collection, 
editing, and validation of information required for the reports, as well as the pro­
duction, publication, and filing of financial statements and reports, including 
eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) electronic filings.

Report

All data needed for disclosures is collected within the application, making it the 
single source of the truth; this information then feeds all disclosures and reports 
in various output formats. By introducing automation into the disclosure manage­
ment process, you can reduce the time and cost associated with manual processes. 
In addition, you can decrease risk by implementing a comprehensive audit trail 
and ensuring the consistency of your data in different reports.
Key Performance Indicators Affecting the Production of Financial Disclosures
The process—and speed—of collecting both structured and unstructured information to 
produce financial statements depends on the size and scope of a company’s activities. 
Some key factors include the following:
 The number of subsidiaries or legal entities
Financial statements and electronic filings must be generated for each legal entity, as 
well as at the group and corporate levels.
 The number of financial statements and disclosures that must be filed
Financial statements must be filed for each country and jurisdiction in which a legal 
entity does business. An added factor is that most local jurisdictions have unique 
rules for the information that is required for disclosure, which may differ significantly 
from a standard annual report. Finally, certain industries, such as insurance, have 
additional filing requirements.
 The number of sources for financial information
Many companies have multiple accounting and consolidation systems. In addition to 
the financial key figures, much of the unstructured information and explanatory notes 
are captured in local spreadsheets, word processing documents, and email, which is 
difficult to track.
 The number of languages required for narrative descriptions
Even though the financial figures are the same, the narrative information must often 
be translated to local languages for regulatory disclosures.
The following measurements are often employed to determine the effectiveness of col­
lecting and validating financial statements and footnotes:
 The number of days for a financial close
The information required for financial disclosures is collected during the standard 
closing processes.
 The number of days to generate financial statements after the close
After the books are closed, financial statements can be generated, which takes addi­
tional time for validation and publication.
 The cost of finance as a percentage of revenue
Streamlining the process of collecting financial statement data reduces the cost of 
finance as a function and frees up the time of financial analysts to do more value-
added work.

Disclosure Management and XBRL Filings

The flow of information in the SAP Disclosure Management application includes 
three stages, as shown in the columns of Figure 10.2:
 Collect input (left column)
Gathering information from source systems.
 Assemble and manage disclosures (center column)
Using workflow to assemble information from the data repository; creating 
forms and reports; and managing the revisions, validations, and approvals of 
the disclosures in preparation for publication.
 Generate output (right column)
Generating reports in various formats, including XBRL electronic filings.
In most companies, various team roles are involved in the different stages of 
working with disclosures:
 Financial analysts and consolidations accountants are responsible for collecting 
the source data and ensuring it is up to date for the disclosure processes.
 Corporate reporting and investor relations teams create and validate the 
reports for both regulatory disclosures and management reports.

Using Microsoft Office with SAP Disclosure Management
SAP Disclosure Management provides a lean, web-based user interface to access all of 
the information collected in the application. You can see examples of these screens later 
in this chapter in Figure 10.6 for monitoring the disclosure process, and Figure 10.7 for 
accessing individual data sources, forms, and report chapters.
At the same time, finance teams can still use the tools with which they are most familiar: 
Microsoft Office applications. As part of the SAP Disclosure Management solution, 
financial team members install a SAP Disclosure Management client on their local com­
puters, which is an add-in for Microsoft Office. The add-in creates a new menu (or rib­
bon, as of Microsoft Office 2007) within the Microsoft Office applications, including 
Microsoft Word (as shown later in Figure 10.8), Microsoft Excel (as shown later in Figure 
10.4), and Microsoft PowerPoint. The minimum required release is Microsoft Office 
2003.
Using this add-in, you can trigger data refreshes and updates in the Microsoft Office 
documents, for example, if a key figure has changed in the source data. You can also 
compare report versions, and update SAP Disclosure Management with any changes 
that you made to your disclosure reports and forms.
Now, let’s take a look at the processes and details found in the left column of Fig­
ure 10.2, specifically collecting input in the disclosure process, and how you can 
collect both financial figures and unstructured data from various source systems.
10.1
Collect Information from Source Systems
As you prepare to gather the information for your financial disclosures, you need 
to identify the sources of the data and where they reside. This information will 
likely come from other systems—SAP systems or non-SAP systems—and will 
include both financial key figures as well as additional descriptive and narrative 
information. All of this data is stored within SAP Disclosure Management, which 

Disclosure Management and XBRL Filings
218
10
becomes your data repository for all disclosures. We will now take a look at 
obtaining both the structured (financial key figures) and unstructured informa­
tion.
10.1.1
Financial Figures for Disclosure Reports
Key figures such as financial account balances can be brought in directly from 
multiple sources. Most commonly, this information comes from consolidation 
systems such as SAP Business Planning and Consolidation, SAP Financial Consol­
idation, and SAP Strategic Enterprise Management (SAP SEM) (for additional 
information about these solutions, please refer to Chapter 9). Other data sources 
include business intelligence systems, such as SAP BusinessObjects Business Intel­
ligence (BI) solutions and SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse (SAP NetWeaver 
BW), and core financial systems such as SAP ERP Financials. You can also bring in 
data from non-SAP systems and even spreadsheets. In the initial implementation, 
you create a link from SAP Disclosure Management to each of the data sources. 
The system administrator uses a wizard during the installation of SAP Disclosure 
Management to create the links between the source data and the disclosure man­
agement database. This typically means providing the location of the source files 
and systems within a company network. SAP NetWeaver BW is a special case; for 
this connection, a SAP Disclosure Management BW connector is delivered with 
the application and is configured with the appropriate server information.
After the key figures are updated within the SAP Disclosure Management appli­
cation, you can access them from the Report tab, using the General subtab. 
When you select a data source, it is opened with Microsoft Excel. From within 
Microsoft Excel, you use the add-in ribbon to use the SAP Disclosure Manage­
ment capabilities; for more information, please refer to the “Using Microsoft 
Office with SAP Disclosure Management” box. Still, all standard spreadsheet 
capabilities that are normally found in Microsoft Excel are available, including 
formatting and graphs, the use of formulas, and rounding.
When you maintain a link to a source system, you can update the SAP Disclosure 
Management data repository if information in a source system changes, for exam­
ple, when additional elimination entries are posted in a consolidation system. 
This allows you to begin working on your financial disclosures even before the 
entire financial close is complete, accelerating the overall process. You can access 
the data sources from the Microsoft add-in, as shown in Figure 10.3.

Collect Information from Source Systems
219
10.1
After the updates, you can see the changes that were made in a particular work­
sheet by using the Compare functionality from the add-in ribbon. You can com­
pare the current data with any of the prior versions. The results of the comparison 
are shown in a new document, which you can save. Each cell that was changed is 
highlighted in a different color, for example, in cells R7 and U10 in Figure 10.4.
Figure 10.3  Three Data Sources Available for Updates
Figure 10.4  Using the SAP Disclosure Management Add-In to Work with Financial Key Figures 
within Microsoft Excel

Disclosure Management and XBRL Filings
220
10
In addition, the prior value in the cell, in the version you are comparing against, 
is captured as a comment to the cell, as shown in cell R7. This capability allows 
you to easily see changes without having to run multiple reports and perform 
manual comparisons.
If you have chosen multiple data sources, for example, from multiple consolida­
tion systems, each data source is opened in its own tab, as shown at the bottom of 
Figure 10.4.
The information in the data repository is used in all of the reports that require 
this information. Ensuring that the reports and disclosure statements refer to the 
data repository maintains the consistency of the information across all reports.
10.1.2
Unstructured Information in Financial Statements
While the figures in a financial statement reveal the financial health of a com­
pany, this numeric, quantitative data does not tell the entire story. Explanations 
of those results are found in the fine print—in the narrative and the financial foot­
notes of annual reports and financial statements. These footnotes contain prima­
rily qualitative, unstructured information, and are required for compliant 
financial statements. Over half of all enterprise data—as much as 80%—is in an 
unstructured format.
This qualitative information required can take multiple forms:
 Breaking down account-level detail
Some financial figures disclosed in an annual report or financial statement 
must be broken down to further levels of detail, for example, deprecation fig­
ures for fixed assets based on different depreciation methods. The level of 
detail required can also change from year to year, so the supplementary infor­
mation is often maintained as unstructured information so that it does not 
interfere with the core accounting and consolidations processes, and avoids 
restructuring the chart of accounts on a regular basis.
 Explaining the financial results
Narrative information is required to explain assumptions and company poli­
cies to allow investors and external stakeholders to properly evaluate the com­
pany’s financial position. Examples include providing details behind the 
pension plan and assumptions behind goodwill. Narrative is also used to 

Collect Information from Source Systems
221
10.1
explain changes in year-over-year results, for example, if there was a significant
increase or decrease in a particular financial figure such as revenue, or changes 
in operating margin which may be due to an acquisition.
In external disclosures such as the annual report, the qualitative information is 
provided alongside tables and financial statements. In addition, the qualitative 
information is also required when disclosing financial statements to regulatory 
bodies. There are several ways you can collect unstructured information:
 Manual entry
Using a system to collect the unstructured information is not necessary; you 
can enter it directly into SAP Disclosure Management by using Microsoft 
Office applications.
 Upload of Microsoft Office documents
If you already have existing material, including executive statements, descrip­
tions of your products, or graphics, you can upload these directly into SAP Dis­
closure Management. 
 Consolidation solutions
Both the SAP Business Planning and Consolidation and SAP Financial Consoli­
dation applications allow you to capture financial notes in text fields as part of 
the consolidation process. It’s basically a text field within the BPC and FC solu­
tions. The mapping goes back to identifying the source system (by the sysad­
min). For further details, please refer to Chapter 9.
 SAP Notes Management
This application allows you to collect, validate, and report on descriptive and 
other supplementary data for both the entity close and the group close. For fur­
ther details, please refer to the “SAP Notes Management” box.
If you are using a consolidation, data warehouse, or notes management system to 
manage your unstructured information, you can bring this information into SAP 
Disclosure Management in the same way that you bring in consolidation key fig­
ures by creating a mapping to the source systems and documents, as described in 
Section 10.1.1.
SAP Notes Management
The SAP Notes Management application is a separate application built on top of SAP 
NetWeaver BW, which allows you to collect and reuse unstructured descriptive data. As 
shown in Figure 10.5, you can leverage your existing chart of accounts and link directly 

Disclosure Management and XBRL Filings
222
10
to consolidation figures using a form that allows you to break down account-level 
information. You can also create other forms that allow you to enter textual information 
that is also linked to the consolidation figures.
To ensure data consistency and reliability, you can define validation rules that include 
calculations of key figures, for example, to ensure that any account breakdowns sum up 
to the consolidation values. This information can also be exported to Microsoft Excel, 
including any calculations that are defined in the forms. For narrative information, rules 
can also ensure that textual descriptions are not missing. A report is available as an 
Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) document to allow finance teams to ensure 
that the descriptions are complete and do not contradict each other.
Figure 10.5  Linking to Consolidation Figures and Breaking Down Account-Level Information in 
SAP Notes Management
You can monitor the progress of collecting all data source information in a cockpit 
view, in the same way that you can monitor the progress of the completion of 
reports and forms; for more information, please refer to Section 10.2.1.
Now that we have seen how to use source data from different systems, let’s look 
at a customer story. Metcalf was able to include data from SAP and non-SAP 
source systems into its disclosure management process for better control of its 
regulatory reporting processes.
10.1.3
Customer Story: Metcash Delivers the Goods in 
Corporate Governance
Sydney-based Metcash Ltd. is a wholesaler and distributor that works with inde­
pendent Australasian retailers in the grocery, liquor, automotive, and hardware 
sectors, providing them with the scale necessary to create competitive buying 
power together with marketing, distribution, and financial expertise and support.

223
10.1
Founded as a family business in 1927, Metcash listed on the Australian stock 
exchange in 2005, which took the company into a business environment with an 
increasing number of regulatory and compliance challenges. Recognizing that try­
ing to tackle regulatory reporting without automation was highly inefficient, Met­
cash initiated a project to introduce software tools that would deliver an end-to-
end process for the financial close and provide a robust platform for compliance 
with corporate governance requirements.
When it came to automating the management of external reporting, Metcash 
needed a solution that was easy to integrate with both its SAP landscape and non-
SAP solutions and was scalable to meet reporting needs that the company may 
face in the future. The SAP Disclosure Management application satisfied these 
requirements, and the company partnered with Innogence Ltd., a recognized 
leader in supporting SAP solutions that is known for delivering successful enter­
prise projects. Critically the company also had personnel who were already fully 
familiar with the chosen solution, which ensured a rapid implementation and roll 
out.
From struggling with manual processes, the introduction of SAP Disclosure Man­
agement means that Metcash now enjoys a very high level of monitoring and con­
trol throughout the financial close process, with managers able to collaborate to 
identify and address issues before they result in delays. As finance staff can map 
and audit the flow of data from core financial systems through to final reports and 
disclosures, Metcash has greater confidence in the accuracy of the information 
displayed in its published reports, and the company can more easily satisfy all of 
its corporate governance responsibilities. The workflow management functional­
ity at the heart of the solution also expedites the process with faster processing so 
that reports are completed on schedule.
Having satisfied the needs of the regulators, the next step for Metcash is to 
expand the use of the application to produce its annual and board reports.
Now that we understand how data sources are linked to SAP Disclosure Manage­
ment, let’s take a look at the center column in Figure 10.2, assembling and man­
aging the various disclosure reports and forms.

Disclosure Management and XBRL Filings
224

10.2
Manage Financial Statements and Reports
Within SAP Disclosure Management, you define the structure of various financial 
reports, forms, and disclosures. Let’s look at how you can keep track of the 
progress of each report, and then we’ll review how to manage individual report 
documents.
10.2.1
Tracking the Progress of the Disclosure Process
You can create multiple reports and break them down by chapter and subchapter. 
Examples are an annual report and forms such as the 10Q and 20F. You can reuse 
a single chapter in more than one report and form, so that you do not need to 
duplicate the information. You define these reports on the Administration tab, 
using the Manage reports link. In addition to the report structure, you also 
define which Microsoft Office application is used for editing. Finally, a report is 
created for a particular period; periods are defined on the Settings tab, using the 
Periods link. Once created, a report can be copied for subsequent periods.
At any time, you can see an overview of the progress of the disclosure report or 
form from the cockpit of each report within SAP Disclosure Management, from 
the Report tab on the Cockpit subtab. Note that this status view is also available 
for the import of data that was discussed in Section 10.1.1.
In Figure 10.6, you can see the status of the annual report using traffic light sym­
bols; that is, when you are past the due date (in the Due date column) for a par­
ticular chapter or section, the status (in the Step column) automatically turns red, 
and completed chapters are green. Other information that is available includes 
the number of times the chapter has been revised (Revision column), whether it 
is currently being edited (Checked out by column), the file size (Size column) the 
document type used for editing (Type column), and the last date (Last modified
on column) and person (Last modified by column) to make a change. A more 
comprehensive audit trail of all versions and changes is also available in the 
detailed view of the chapter, shown in Figure 10.7 in the next section, from the 
History subtab.

Manage Financial Statements and Reports
225
10.2
10.2.2
Manage Report Documents
After you have defined the structure of each report and form, you can assign the 
responsibility for updating the document at the chapter and the subchapter levels 
(for additional information, please refer to Section 10.3.1). In addition, when a 
team member accesses a chapter, it is considered “checked out” and is therefore 
locked for changes by other team members. This capability allows multiple team 
members to work on the overall annual report at the same time without overwrit­
ing each other’s sections, ensuring one version of the truth.
As shown in Figure 10.7, selecting either the entire document at the highest level, 
or an individual chapter within the report structure, will bring you to the Gen­
eral subtab, changing the view to show the report structure on the left and the 
header information about the chapter you selected on the right. This detailed 
information includes the status of the document and the associated possible 
actions, the last time it was checked out, and any comments that summarize the 
most recent changes. From this detail screen, you can either edit (choose the Edit
button) or view (choose the View button) the document.

When you edit a document, you can work on it directly within Microsoft Word, 
again leveraging the add-in to Microsoft Office (please refer to the “Using 
Microsoft Office with SAP Disclosure Management” box). Microsoft Word is the 
primary application in which you combine information of financial key figures, 
unstructured information, charts from either Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Pow­
erPoint, and other graphical elements for financial statements and forms. For 
board packages, Microsoft PowerPoint is often used to combine structured and 
unstructured information for executive presentations.
The link to the financial key figures is especially valuable because you can refresh 
the information from the data repository of SAP Disclosure Management in case 
of changes. Examples of incorporating financial figures into the narrative include 
the following:
 Tables
You can insert entire statements or statement sections of your financial 
reports; to do so, you must define them as named ranges in Microsoft Excel.
 Individual key figures and text fields
This is especially valuable if you are referring to a number within your descrip­
tive text, for example, by calling out a revenue number for a particular product 
line.

Individual Chapter

10.2
 Formulas
In addition to standard formulas, you can also define logic that will change 
wording within descriptive text. For example, if you are making a statement 
about a year-over-year comparison based on a calculation, you can change the 
wording “increased” to “decreased” when describing the result, ensuring that 
your text is always in sync with your figures.
Changes are tracked within Microsoft Word using the standard Track Changes 
review functionality, as shown in Figure 10.8. This applies to changes that are 
made when refreshing the key figures from the data repository, as well as any 
changes to the narrative or graphical information. Similar to the comparison func­
tionality described in Section 10.1.1, you can compare the current Microsoft 
Word document against any prior version; the results are shown in a new docu­
ment, which you can save.

When working with documents, you can use SAP Disclosure Management to 
facilitate communication, to guard against conflicting edits, and to ensure that the 
disclosure reports are generated in a timely fashion. Let’s look at the collabora­
tion and workflow features available to facilitate this speed and consistency.
10.3
Collaboration and Workflow
At each step of the disclosure management process, you can use collaboration to 
enable better communication between team members to accelerate the comple­
tion of the financial and regulatory statements, as well as to ensure that there are 
no conflicting edits to the chapters and reports.
SAP Disclosure Management enables communication and workflow between 
team members who are responsible for creating financial statements and reports. 
The collaboration features can apply to the management of the data repository, to 
the individual chapters within a financial statement, and to the summary level of 
each complete financial statement and regulatory report. In this section, we will 
look at the elements of creating the collaborative environment, including role 
definitions, document control, workflow and status management, and approvals.
10.3.1
Role Definitions and Configuration of Workflow
Various roles are delivered standard within SAP Disclosure Management, and 
new roles can be configured under the Administration tab by using the Roles
link. The permissions that are available to be assigned to each role are shown in 
Figure 10.9. Typical roles include the following:
 Editor
You can define whether an editor has access to only a specific chapter; for 
example, a receivables manager may only have access to the accounts receiv­
able chapter. At the same time, you should still define an editor that has access 
to the overall report, for example if a global change needs to be made.
 Manager/Approver
Similar to the role of an editor, you can define whether a manager can approve 
only certain chapters or the entire report. From a process standpoint, after all 
chapters and subchapters are approved, one or more executives should still be 
named to approve the financial statement or form as a whole.

Collaboration and Workflow
229
10.3
 Administrator
The system administrator has access to create mappings to data sources, create 
report structures, create users and roles, and configure the workflow. After 
SAP Disclosure Management has been set up, the administrator also has the 
capability to unlock a chapter or report that was finally approved; in most com­
panies, this capability is not given to business users, but to administrators or 
power users. For additional information about approvals, please refer to Sec­
tion 10.3.4.
It is possible to assign multiple roles to the same user, which allows you to stan­
dardize the role definitions, yet still provides you with the flexibility to give users 
additional authorizations within the disclosure management process.
10.3.2
Document Control
As mentioned, your finance team members have the ability to check out a portion 
of the data repository and the financial reports and forms. Either an individual 
chapter, or the entire financial statement, can be checked out for editing. When a 
Figure 10.9  The Roles Assigned to Users Contain Specific Permissions 
for the Activities They are Allowed to Perform

Disclosure Management and XBRL Filings
230
10
team member checks out a chapter, it is locked so that no other team members 
can make changes; this guards against a proliferation of versions and conflicting 
edits. Checking out documents at a chapter level also allows multiple team mem­
bers to work on the same overall document without blocking each other.
The check-out occurs automatically when you access a chapter in edit mode. 
When the document is checked back in using the add-in ribbon functionality 
(please refer to the “Using Microsoft Office with SAP Disclosure Management” 
box), all changes are tracked, and an audit trail is created to record each check-
out, cancellation of check-out, and check-in of a document. Team members also 
have the ability to enter a comment that summarizes the types of changes they 
made.
When a chapter is checked back in after editing, workflow can help with collabo­
ration by sending a notification to the next person who needs to work on the 
chapter, either for further edits or for an approval. In the next section, we will 
discuss the elements of workflow and how it enables status management for dis­
closures.
10.3.3
Workflow and Status Management
Workflow capabilities are embedded within SAP Disclosure Management to 
define each step that is required in producing chapters and financial statements. 
For each step that is part of the workflow, you can define the following options:
 The next possible activities, or steps, that you want to allow a financial user
to carry out
For example, if a chapter is open, it cannot be approved without being com­
pleted or finished. For a chapter that is finished, the possible subsequent activ­
ities are an approval or rejection, but not editing.
 The definition of the status that is active for each step
This option allows you to simplify monitoring of the progress of a financial 
statement on overview screens in the cockpit, using meaningful statuses and 
the traffic light symbols.
 Conditions that further refine the possible actions
The most common type of condition allows you to assign specific user roles to 
individual steps, such as editor roles to the processing of documents, and man­
agerial roles to the step that controls document approval.

Collaboration and Workflow
231
10.3
A standard workflow is delivered, but you can change it or create new workflows. 
You can access the workflows from the Administration tab, using the Workflow
link. Figure 10.10 shows a graphical view of the delivered workflow. You can see 
that the workflow does not need to be linear, and you may have multiple options 
for each step. For example, from the initial Open status, you can set the status to 
be either In Progress or Finished, but you cannot approve directly from the Open 
status. By using these workflow statuses, you can define the appropriate controls 
for each chapter which results in a documented audit trail.
As part of the workflow setup, you can also determine the status that is displayed 
for each chapter, based on the activities that have taken place through the work­
flow. Figure 10.11, accessed from the Steps subtab of the workflow configura­
tion, shows the status (in the Linked status column), the next possible steps that 
can be taken for each status (in the Next step column), and the role associated 
with that step (in the Condition value column).

You can define different workflows for different types of reports and forms using 
the parameters that we just covered. Each report can only be linked to a single 
workflow. However, you can use the same workflow for more than one report. 
The workflow then applies to all chapters within that report or statement, as well 
as to the overall report. The link between a report and a workflow is made in the 
Settings tab by using the Manage reports link.
Finally, you can enable notifications and determine if they are mandatory or 
optional; if notifications are enabled, an email is sent to team members after a 
chapter or financial statement has been checked in and is ready for the next step, 
whether that is further editing or approval. These notifications are activated on a 
report level and are part of the setup of the assignment between a report and a 
workflow. If notifications are activated, they apply to the entire financial state­
ment or form, as well as to each chapter within these reports. If notifications are 
mandatory, an email is sent automatically; if they are optional, the team member 
will see a popup during the check-in of a chapter, asking whether a notification 
should be sent.
10.3.4
Approvals
When the editing steps have been completed for a chapter or entire financial 
statement, the workflow also controls the management of the approval process. 
The document status configured in the workflow, for example indicating that 
work on the chapter is finished, determines that the only available activities are 
approval or rejection. The approval step is typically assigned to managers and 
executives who have responsibility for corporate financial reporting. Figure 
10.12 shows the options of approval and rejection on the detail screen of a chap­
ter in the SAP Disclosure Management application.

10.3
When a chapter is approved, it is locked for further editing. You may choose to 
give a select group, usually in an administrator or a power user role, the ability to 
unlock an approved chapter or statement to accommodate additional changes.
Now that we’ve reviewed the collaborative tools found in SAP Disclosure Man­
agement, let’s look at a customer story. The GEA Group was able to use the col­
laboration features of SAP Disclosure Management to accelerate the creation of 
financial statements.
10.3.5
Customer Story: GEA Group Produces Audit-Compliant 
Financial Statements Faster
As a publicly listed company with its stock listed on the German MDAX stock 
index, the food and energy system process provider GEA Group must publish its 
quarterly, midyear, and year-end financial statements by specific deadlines. 
Besides the consolidated balance sheet, profit and loss statement, cash-flow state­
ment, statement of stockholders’ equity, and notes concerning the consolidated 
financial statements, these reports include management reporting, a business out­
look, and stock information.
With the results of six business divisions to manually update and report on, this 
used to be a labor-intensive and time-consuming task with an inherent risk of 
errors. But since GEA Group implemented SAP Disclosure Management, all of the 
Figure 10.12  The Approval Screen for a Chapter after it is Complete

234

financial data and information needed is in a single data repository, and the inte­
grated workflow management functionality means the company has a closed-
loop process from financial consolidation right through to the generation of its 
financial reports.
Working with SAP partner cundus AG, the accounting department at GEA Group 
successfully implemented the new solution within eight weeks and went live 
immediately as the 20 users found the application so user-friendly and straight­
forward to work with that they needed little training. Working with familiar 
Microsoft Office tools, the team created more than 40 standard templates, and 
now everything required for producing the reports—the balance sheet figures, 
notes, texts, graphics, and tables from the business divisions—flows into the SAP 
solution at the click of a mouse.
At the same time, all of the steps are documented in an audit-compliant way so 
both company management and external auditors can track the source of the 
financial figures and see who changed them and when. Furthermore, reports can 
now be produced in a variety of formats, including Microsoft Word, Microsoft 
Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and the Adobe PDF files needed by the external 
graphic design agency responsible for the printed version of the annual report.
Using SAP Disclosure Management, reports can be created up to 20% faster, so 
GEA Group can meet the increasingly tough legal requirements with timely exter­
nal reporting, while accounting employees have more time for their core tasks.
Now that we have seen how to complete the process of managing the disclosure 
documents, let’s take a look at the different types of output formats you can gen­
erate within SAP Disclosure Management, as shown in the right column in Figure 
10.2.
10.4
Publish Disclosure Statements and Reports
Multiple document output formats are available for the disclosure information. 
For external statements, such as the annual report, the most common format is 
Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF. Alternately, for executive board packages, 
Microsoft PowerPoint can incorporate numeric and narrative disclosure informa­
tion and display it in a graphical presentation format.

Publish Disclosure Statements and Reports
235
10.4
At any time in the process of collecting and editing the financial and disclosure 
statements, you can generate a preview in various formats, either for an individ­
ual chapter or the entire document or form, such as the entire annual report. You 
access the preview in various formats under the Available preview types links in 
the right side of the detail screen, as shown earlier in Figure 10.7. The types of 
preview formats that are available for a particular report are defined in the report 
type definition, which you can access on the Administration tab using the 
Report types link. These previews allow you to see the complete report or a chap­
ter without checking it out.
You can control the formatting of the document in Microsoft Word through the 
use of templates that are applied to the document. The template contains default 
style information, such as the font, logos, and table formatting. The templates are 
associated with a report, by selecting a report from the initial SAP Disclosure 
Management cockpit, from the Templates subtab. The temaplate applies to all 
chapters within a report. Figure 10.13 shows an example of an annual report in 
Adobe PDF format, including the cover graphic, table of contents, and formatted 
narrative text and tables.
Figure 10.13  A Preview of an Annual Report in Adobe PDF Format

Disclosure Management and XBRL Filings

Just as it is possible to compare versions of documents in Microsoft Word and 
Microsoft Excel, further comparison capabilities are available within SAP Disclo­
sure Management. Select a period and report under the Report tab, and go to the 
Revisions subtab. Here you can compare against prior versions (called Revisions); 
you can also select an external file to compare again. The comparison is published 
as an Adobe PDF document.
A special use case is a comparions of a publication-ready report in Adobe PDF 
with a version that is returned from an external printer, which is accessed as an 
external document. In addition to highlighting standard changes—such as key fig­
ures and text changes—the comparison feature is able to identify whether whole 
sections have been moved around within the document, so that it is easier to see 
the actual changes, not just the reorganization of a statement.
Finally, the disclosure information can also be published in a web format, or 
HTML. This eases the process of publishing results on a corporate website, which 
public companies typically make available for their investors.
We will now look at a special case of output in the XBRL instance document, 
which is necessary for the electronic filing of financial disclosures with various 
regulatory agencies.
10.5
Create and File XBRL Statements
An increasing number of countries are mandating the electronic filing of financial 
and other regulatory documents in the XBRL format. To meet these requirements, 
companies doing business in those countries need to be able to tag source infor­
mation and create XBRL instance documents. These documents are then filed 
electronically with various regulatory agencies; a few examples include the 
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S. SEC), the United King­
dom’s Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Germany’s E-Bilanz, and 
sustainability disclosures for the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability 
Disclosure Database. Please refer to the “XBRL for Electronic Filings” box for 
additional information on XBRL. There is a trend to expand the usage of XBRL to 
other scenarios as well; for additional information, please refer to the “Trends in 
XBRL” box.

Create and File XBRL Statements
237
10.5
The capability to tag data and create XBRL documents is built directly into SAP 
Disclosure Management, which leverages UBMatrix applications. You access 
these capabilities on the XBRL Factory tab. The same information in the data 
repository that is used to create financial statements is also leveraged to create the 
XBRL instance documents, which are used for electronic filing. This ensures the 
consistency of information across all reporting formats, regardless of whether the 
completed regulatory statement information is published in a report or is filed 
electronically.
While some companies outsource the tagging and generation of the XBRL 
instance documents, this often takes additional time. After the data has been 
given to the outsourced service provider, it is very difficult to make changes; if a 
late financial entry must be made, having separate work streams for publishing 
the statements and the electronic filings increases the risk of inconsistencies. And 
after an outsourced service has been provided, your company is still responsible 
for ensuring that the information in the XBRL instance documents is correct, 
which adds even more time.
It is important to realize that bringing the process of XBRL submissions in-house 
requires companies to ensure that their internal teams have the appropriate 
knowledge of the requirements of jurisdictions; however, for final validations 
even in an outsourced process, the responsibility was already squrely on the side 
of the filing company. With SAP Disclosure Management, you can save time and 
reduce the risk of inconsistencies by making it part of one workstream.
XBRL for Electronic Filings
XBRL is an open standard that is fast becoming the global standard for electronic filing 
of disclosures. Information in financial and other regulatory disclosures is tagged with a 
set of standard, computer-readable tags based on the eXtensible Markup Language 
(XML). These tags identify the components of a statement, such as a footnote or a table, 
and individual data elements, including a description of individual values, rounding fac­
tors (such as identifying whether rounding is to the thousands or millions), and report­
ing currency. Standard taxonomies have been agreed upon by the XBRL international 
organization. A taxonomy is a set of tags for a particular regulatory agency or tax juris­
diction. These tags can be extended in certain circumstances. More information is avail­
able at www.xbrl.org. A company may need to file multiple financial results for different 
jurisdictions and accounting principles; for example, a company may need to file in U.S. 
GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and in IFRS (International Financial 
Reporting Standards).

Disclosure Management and XBRL Filings
238

Several levels of detail are required for tagging. As an example, for the U.S. SEC, there 
are four levels:
 Level 1
Each complete footnote is tagged as a single block of text.
 Level 2
Each significant accounting policy within the significant accounting policies footnote 
is tagged.
 Level 3
Each table within each footnote is tagged.
 Level 4
Within each footnote, each amount (e.g., monetary value, percentage, and number) 
and each description is separately tagged, and each narrative disclosure required to 
be disclosed by the applicable accounting standard and regulating agency is sepa­
rately tagged.
Other countries have different regulations regarding formats. For example:
 In the United Kingdom, iXBRL (inline XBRL) tags are used, meaning that the XBRL 
tags are added to standard business reports. Readers of these reports may not even 
be aware that there are computer-readable tags embedded in the report.
 In the United States, filing must be done through EDGAR (the Electronic Data Gath­
ering Analysis and Retrieval system), which requires specific HTML tags to be 
included as part of the electronic filing. The EDGARized file is created from within the 
Microsoft Word document, using the SAP Disclosure Management add-in, as shown 
in Figure 10.14. For more information about the add-in itself, please refer to the 
“Using Microsoft Office with SAP Disclosure Management” box.
 In Germany, the E-Bilanz filings must be performed via the ERiC (Elster Rich Client).
 In India, the the MCA (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) has a validation tool that must 
be used when filing XBRL instance documents.

Let’s look at what is involved in tagging the information in preparation for filing, 
as well as the generation of the XBRL instance document.

10.5.1
Tagging Data for Filing Financial Statement and Forms
Each jurisdiction typically has a standard taxonomy that you can access through 
the web or download and store locally. Within the SAP Disclosure Management 
application, all taxonomies are supported.
To work with XBRL capabilities, access the form or report from the Report tab 
from the General subtab, and edit the document. Team members who work on 
XBRL tagging and publication must install the Report Builder add-in similar to 
the general SAP Disclosure Management add-in. This add-in allows you to choose 
a taxonomy and also facilitates searches, filters, and the use of business rules so 
that you can identify the appropriate tag for each data element.
You can then easily tag the information in the Microsoft Excel document through 
drag and drop as shown in Figure 10.15. After the information is tagged, you can 
reuse the spreadsheet that contains the tags in future periods with refreshed val­
ues. XBRL tagging can also be done in Microsoft Word.
Figure 10.15  Tagged Data Elements and Key Figures in Preparation for the Generation of XBRL 
Instance Documents.

To assist companies with tagging, starter kits are available with pretagged content 
(please refer to the “Accelerating Disclosure Management Processes” box). Also, 
after the tagging has been completed in the initial implementation, the source 
documents—in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, or an XML editor—can be 
rolled forward to future years. You can simply update the figures and narrative, 
but it will only be necessary to update newly introduced tags that may have 
become a part of the standard taxonomy since the prior year.
Accelerating Disclosure Management Processes
To accelerate the implementation of SAP Disclosure Management, starter kits are avail­
able that contain preconfigured content, specifically for pretagging of XBRL content for 
several different accounting standards, including U.S. GAAP and IFRS. For additional 
information, please refer to Chapter 9, Section 9.4.1.
In addition to starter kits, a Rapid Deployment Solution (RDS) is available that bundles 
preconfigured content and SAP services. The SAP Financial Close and Disclosure Man­
agement rapid-deployment solution leverages the starter kits and helps you to connect 
SAP Disclosure Management to the consolidation solutions available within the portfo­
lio of the SAP solutions for enterprise performance management (SAP solutions for 
EPM). For additional information, please refer to Chapter 9, Section 9.4.2.
In addition to the financial close, several industries have additional disclosure require­
ments. The SAP Solvency II Regulatory Reporting rapid-deployment solution supports 
the insurance industry’s Solvency II, Pillar III, which includes quantitative reporting tem­
plates (QRTs) for the required disclosure reports, such as the Report to Supervisor (RTS) 
and Solvency and Financial Consolidation (SFCR) reports.
10.5.2
XBRL Instance Documents
After all of the information has been tagged, you can create the XBRL instance 
document. This is done from the XBRL Factory tab. You select the period, the 
legal entity for which you want to create the XBRL instance document (which is 
defined in the Administration tab, using the Entities link), and the tagged report 
or form.
From this screen, you can run validations in the system for both syntax and 
semantics to ensure that the data is correct. Examples of validations include find­
ing data elements for which tagging is not complete, and finding errors and 
inconsistencies, such as whether or not the assets and liabilities are balanced 
within the balance sheet.

Create and File XBRL Statements
241
10.5
You can also access a preview of the XBRL instance document. Because the syntax 
of this document is difficult to read, you can use a preview capability to more eas­
ily verify that the information in the instance document is correct. Figure 10.16
shows the native XBRL instance document, which is a type of XML, as well as a 
more user-friendly preview used by finance teams. Once validated, you can then 
submit the electronic filing.
The following customer story illustrates how SAP itself has implemented both 
SAP Disclosure Management and SAP Notes Management to support financial 
disclosures and XBRL filings.
10.5.3
Customer Story: SAP Speeds Up the Last Mile of Financial 
Reporting with SAP Disclosure Management
SAP faces exactly the same challenges as its growing list of customers, so it should 
come as no surprise that it makes extensive use of its own solutions. To gather 
financial data, such as pension disclosures, that is not available in the company’s 
accounting records from its 235 subsidiaries around the globe, the company uses 
SAP Notes Management. Corporate finance also uses SAP Disclosure Management

to automate the data transfer from the company’s accounting and consolidation 
systems to generate both internal and external reports. The combination of these 
two applications supports SAP in the preparation and generation of reports in 
compliance with key regulatory requirements such as the U.S. SEC’s Form 20-F 
and IFRS. An important feature of SAP Disclosure Management is its support of 
XBRL, which is now mandated by an increasing number of regulatory bodies.
With an intuitive user interface and a collaborative document management tool 
that allows users to work in their familiar Microsoft Office environment, it only 
took a one-hour web-based training session to familiarize users with SAP Disclo­
sure Management. The cockpit that comes with the solution shows the current 
status of the reporting process at a glance and instantly highlights changes so they 
can be scheduled for review and approval—the entire process being managed 
with automated workflow to expedite reporting cycles. Another extremely useful 
feature is the document-locking function that prevents users from simultaneously 
editing the same document and amending approved documents.
SAP Disclosure Management helps SAP streamline the collection and manage­
ment of relevant information across the enterprise and generate and publish reli­
able and auditable financial and regulatory statements. It helped the company cut 
down the preparation time for the statement of cash flows from three days to 
three hours and the preparation of the 2011 financial statement took a full week 
less than it did the previous year, releasing the corporate finance team for other 
value-adding activities.
Trends in XBRL
Currently, the primary use of XBRL is for external, regulatory disclosures for company 
financial results. An increasing number of jurisdictions, as well as industries, are requir­
ing disclosures in this format. More countries are also investigating other uses of elec­
tronic filings, such as electronic tax filings.
Another potential use is for integrated reporting, which is a periodic report that com­
municates how a company engages in value creation over time through strategy, gover­
nance, performance, and prospects. This report brings together not only financial figures 
and narrative information but also operational, environmental, social, and brand ele­
ments. More information on integrated reporting and the associated standards is avail­
able on the website of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) at http://
www.theiirc.org.

Summary
243
10.6
The use of standard data taxonomies may facilitate internal reporting as well in the long 
run. One of the most common examples is the idea to bring external market data into a 
disclosure management system to compare your own company’s performance against 
the market using information in these standard tags. As companies become more versed 
in the use of XBRL, additional scenarios will likely be developed.
10.6
Summary
SAP Disclosure Management helps you collect both structured and unstructured 
information from various source systems, and manage the production of financial 
statements and reports using familiar Microsoft Office tools and collaborative fea­
tures such as workflow. You can then publish the resulting statements in a variety 
of formats, including the annual report in a PDF and HTML format, board pack­
ages in Microsoft Office formats, and generate XBRL electronic filings.
In the next chapter, we will look at various financial reports that allow you to ana­
lyze your financial results and the SAP tools that support sophisticated reporting 
and analytics.

The culmination of the financial close process is the creation of financial 
reports. The purpose of financial reporting is to deliver information about 
an organization so that people can make decisions based on financial per­
formance. In this chapter, we will look at reporting requirements and 
delivery methods.
11
Financial Reporting
The specific data that is analyzed and reported can be a huge differentiator for a 
company. Information is extremely powerful, and being able to leverage it 
accordingly can make or break an organization. Financial reporting is all about 
“getting stuff out” as shown in Figure 11.1. Once data has been reconciled, trans­
lated, eliminated and adjusted, as discussed in our previous chapters, it then 
needs to be reported.
This chapter discusses several different reporting requirements and then dis­
cusses some different delivery methods as well. We will address these at a rela­
tively high level because the specific requirements for different organizations 
vary immensely.
11.1
Reporting Requirements
In this section, we will explore at a high level the following various financial 
reports as well as the requirements that shape them:
 Balance sheet, P&L, and cash flow reporting
 Management reporting

 Statutory reporting
 Variance reporting
 Periodic comparison
 Budget, plan, and forecasting
 Versioning and what-if statements
 Drill-down vs. drill-through functionality
We will delve into each requirement and explore how this shapes the report out­
come. In Section 11.2, we will discuss the different reporting delivery methods, 
such as report delivery through SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence (BI) 
and mobile reports. First, let’s look at the three major reports that are the foun­
dation of financial reporting.
11.1.1
Balance sheet, P&L, and Cash Flow Reporting
Three major reports form the basis of financial reporting. These are the core 
reports for any financial reporting and are heavily used by SAP financial users to 
look at the health of their financial portfolios:
 Statement of financial position (i.e., balance sheet)
 Statement of profit & loss (i.e., income statement)
 Cash flow statement
Figure 11.2 shows the SAP 2012 Annual Report table of contents, which lists all 
of the major financial statements.

11.1
The major reports provide the big picture, but how those numbers were arrived 
at really tell the story. For stockholders of SAP, it’s not just the high-level reports 
that are interesting but also the breakdown of that detail. Revenue by region and 
by industry is also provided in the 2012 SAP Annual Report as shown in Figure 
11.3 and Figure 11.4.

They say the devil is in the details, but the question is, how you get the detail. 
This is where automating the financial reporting process provides most of its 
value—the ability to get to the detail quickly and accurately. Financial profession­
als can then in turn make decisions based on the information they receive.
11.1.2
Management versus Statutory Reporting
Statutory reporting is the reporting of financial reports and information to gov­
ernments and regulatory organizations. There are many different regulations, 
including International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) discussed in Chapter 9,
Section 9.2.5. The purpose of such standards is to provide transparency into an 
organization as well as create consistency, which allows investors and creditors to 
more easily compare one organization to another.
Where and what industry an organization does business with will mandate which 
reporting regulations the company needs to comply. But legal and statutory 
reporting is just the beginning. The purpose of financial reporting is to provide 
financial information to stakeholders. It is important to note that stakeholders are 
not just limited to stockholders. There are many different types of stakeholders 
both internal and external to an organization. Table 11.1 lists examples of both 
internal and external stakeholders.
The management team of an organization needs to be provided with financial 
information in order to make decisions. Financial reports help leaders understand 
what is working well and what is not. Management reports and board reporting 
are key to the success of an organization.

Variance Reporting
Everything is relative, including financials. As such financial information 
becomes more interesting when it is compared with other information. This type 
of reporting is commonly referred to as variance reporting. Two major compari­
sons are periodic reports and budget reporting. Figure 11.5 shows an example of 
both budget and year-over-year reporting.
11.1.4
Periodic Comparison
When financial data is reviewed period over period, it allows organizations to 
trend information. Looking at trends of data allows financial professionals to 
identify patterns and then leverage that information to make decisions that affect 
the organization. Growth over time is an important indicator of the health of an 
organization.

11.1.5
Budget, Plan, and Forecast
Creating a budget is a valuable way for organizations to make decisions on what 
they expect to happen. Typically, a budget is a one-year expectation of expenses 
and revenues. A plan typically occurs over more time, such as 5 or 10 years. A 
forecast is a combination of actuals and planned data. For example, a forecast cre­
ated in May would include the actual January through April numbers and then 
what is expected to happen for May to December. This provides a more accurate 
view of expectations for the year.
11.1.6
Versioning and What If Statements
Being able to easily create reports where finance professionals can compare dif­
ferent scenarios or versions that are based on different conditions is an extremely 
valuable tool. Much analysis and isolation can be done if you can easily and 
quickly run different versions of reports. Figure 11.6 shows revenue by division 
(Divisions column), actual versus budget (Actual/Budget %), and year over year 
(Actual Y-1, YoY_Actual in %, and Actual Y – (Y-1) columns).
Figure 11.6  Revenue Report: Actual versus Budget and Year over Year

Reporting Requirements

Figure 11.7 features several columns: Organic growth, Rate effect, and Scope
effect. Organic growth refers to how a company grew organically, meaning not 
through acquisition. The Rate effect is how much exchange rates affected reve­
nue. Lastly, the Scope effect is how changes in scope affected the amounts. In this 
case, the scope is defined as which entities are to be consolidated at what percent­
ages. If the percentage that a company owns of an entity changes, that will affect 
the financial statements. The ability to isolate these amounts comes from being 
able to run different versions of a consolidation.
Let’s discuss a simple example. Let’s say revenue for a reporting unit is 100 last 
year and 110 this year. The exchange rate was 1.3 last year and 1.4 this year. So 
the year-over-year difference is 24 as listed in Table 11.2.

The translated difference can be split into two parts: the piece that was due to the 
change in the exchange rate and the piece that was due to actual growth in reve­
nue as listed in Table 11.3.
As such, the ability to run last year’s numbers at this year’s rates is extremely 
valuable in order to isolate why numbers change year over year. SAP’s Enterprise 
Performance Management (EPM) solutions allow customers to do this easily.
11.1.7
Drill Down versus Drill Though
We introduced the concept of dimensionality in Chapter 9, Section 9.1.4. If you 
recall, dimensionality is the ability to break down a number into its various 
pieces. Examples of dimensionality include country, division, year, and category 
(actual, budget, etc.). Dimensionality can also be thought of as an axis of analysis; 
that is, if you think of a report and think of what is on the X, Y, or Z axis of that 
report, across the rows or the columns, those are typically dimensions. Figure 
11.7, for example, has divisions along the Y axis.
If you want to see further detail of an amount when looking at a report, you want 
to be able to drill down on that report. For example, Figure 11.8 shows a high-
level Cash flows statement, but you might be interested in the detail behind the 
investing activities.

In Figure 11.9, you can now drill down on that number to see the detail below it 
using the arrow options. There is, however, a software limitation on how far you 
can drill down. In Microsoft Excel, for example, you cannot drill down.
After you drill down to a certain level within a report, you may want additional 
details. For example, you can drill down through net cash flows from (used in) 
investing activities and see revenue reporting from other inflows of cash, pro­
ceeds from sales of intangible assets, and so on. The transactional details aren’t 
typically contained in consolidation systems, so you can’t drill down to the trans­
actional-level data. SAP EPM solutions allows users to drill through to source sys­
tems.
Now that we have explored the common reporting requirement for a financial 
report, let’s look at the delivery methods for the various reports available.

Reporting Delivery Methods
As mentioned in the previous sections of this chapter, there are many financial 
reporting requirements. So the question we now need to ask is what tools should 
you use to create these reports? Each of the previous chapters discusses different 
software solutions to address different parts of the close process. Each solution 
has reporting as part of the standard functionality.
In a perfect world, there would be one mega software solution that did every­
thing: financial reporting, budgeting, planning, payroll, accounts receivables and 
payables, project management, customer relationship management, and the list 
goes on and on and on. But for many reasons, that does not exist.
Different software is used by different people for different purposes. Different 
organizations have unique requirements, so there is no one size fits all that will 
work across all organizations. This is the rationale for not exploring the myriad

different reporting options available in SAP in this chapter. In fact, there is 
already a book on this topic titled Financial Reporting with SAP (SAP PRESS, 
2012). The financial close action plan discussed in Chapter 2 of this book is a good 
place to start. For our purposes, we’ll explore the delivery methods for reporting: 
SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence (BI) and mobility.
11.2.1
Business Intelligence
SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence (BI) solutions simplify data manipula­
tion, allowing users to access, navigate, analyze, format, and share information 
across a corporate environment. They allow a wide range of processes, from 
search and navigation to advanced analytics, enterprise query, reporting and 
analysis, dashboards and visualization, and information infrastructure manage­
ment.
SAP BusinessObjects BI 4.0 is illustrated in Figure 11.10. There is a full book on 
the topic as well titled Reporting and Analysis with SAP BusinessObjects (SAP 
PRESS, 2012).
11.2.2
SAP Crystal Reports
SAP Crystal Reports is the de-facto standard for formatted reporting across the 
world. It offers business users easy to consume, pixel-perfect reports, giving them

the power to make informed decisions quickly and transform the way they run 
their business. With an easy-to-use, intuitive interface, report authors can access 
any data spread across disparate systems, and design compelling reports with 
guided interactivity. They have the option to publish personalized reports to over 
millions of users securely inside and outside the organization or embed reports in 
business applications. Organizations can reduce total cost of ownership and accel­
erate time-to-value by leveraging the collective intelligence and full support from 
a vibrant community of Crystal reports developers and partners.
11.2.3
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards is a drag and drop visualization tool designed to 
create interactive analytics that can be turned into powerful, personalized dash­
boards. Drop-down menus and sliders allow you to present complex business 
data clearly, giving decision makers an easy way to interact with data and test out 
business scenarios –all with the click of a mouse.
Securely and easily source your dashboards from any live data connection, to any 
back-end system. Then share insightful visualizations live via Microsoft Office, 
Adobe PDF, the Web, Crystal Reports, or the SAP BusinessObjects business intel­
ligence (BI) or SAP portal.
11.2.4
SAP BusinessObjects Web Intelligence
SAP BusinessObjects Web Intelligence puts the power of business intelligence 
into the hands of business users with self-service access, ad hoc reporting and 
interactive analysis on all types of data represented in everyday business lan­
guage. With its intuitive, feature rich interface and easy workflows, it will help 
you turn information into actionable insight and make confident decisions in less 
time without depending on IT. Web Intelligence offers flexibility to perform 
online and offline analysis and share those insights with colleagues. With better 
visibility and transparency of information to business users, it enables organiza­
tions to not only manage their business more efficiently, but also respond to 
changing market conditions rapidly.
11.2.5
SAP BusinessObjects Analysis
SAP BusinessObjects Analysis, OLAP edition, is a next generation business intel­
ligence solution that provides self-service multidimensional analysis workspaces 

Reporting Delivery Methods
257
11.2
for personal or shared use over the Web. It enables analysis of existing SAP 
NetWeaver Business Warehouse cubes, SAP Business Explorer queries, and 
Microsoft SQL Server cubes, to uncover deep business insights. With SAP Busi­
nessObjects Analysis, users of SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse or Microsoft 
SQL Server enjoy a modern look-and-feel with a few simple clicks and intuitive 
drag-and-drop steps to run analyses across multiple multidimensional and hierar­
chical data sets. SAP BusinessObjects Analysis increases end-user autonomy and 
self-service usage leading to a broad adoption of business intelligence for more 
informed decision making across the organization while optimizing the return on 
investments and minimizing the total cost of ownership.
11.2.6
SAP BusinessObjects Explorer
SAP BusinessObjects Explorer combines the simplicity and speed of internet 
search and exploration with the trust and analytical power of BI to provide imme­
diate answers to “on the fly” questions, discover relationships, and uncover root 
causes. Users employ familiar keyword search to find information and explore 
data directly without needing to understand the data, its location, or structure. 
Customers can fully leverage existing BI investments like metadata, security, and 
administration services to have SAP BusinessObjects Explorer up and running in 
days and reduce IT backlog.
11.2.7
SAP BusinessObjects BI platform
SAP BusinessObjects BI platform is a flexible and scalable solution designed to 
make it easy to discover and share insight for better decisions. Built on a service-
oriented architecture, the software offers a comprehensive BI suite on a single 
platform. With SAP BusinessObjectsBI platform, IT departments can extend 
insight through a single, trusted BI infrastructure that integrates with existing 
applications, information sources, and technology investments, and provides 
everyone with decision-ready information.
11.2.8
Mobility
Early in 2013, SAP published SAP IT Market Trends and Predictions with industry 
and financial analysts. There were two main lessons learned for accelerating and 
securing the “last mile of finance” through mobile BI. First, there is a consensus 

Financial Reporting
258
11
among major analyst firms to rank mobility adoption as one of the most impor­
tant trends for 2013. They point out the “mobile proliferation” and the significant 
introduction of iPad tablets in the enterprise. The second, and equally important, 
trend is that the number of mobile BI users in the enterprise is expected to grow 
from 20% in 2012 to 54% by the end of 2013.
The financial close to disclose process can be accelerated and streamlined by the 
use of mobile BI in combination with EPM.
SAP Financial Results Insight
SAP Financial Results Insight is a starter kit that provides mobile financial reports 
integrated with SAP Business Planning and Consolidation. It is an essential piece 
of the “last mile of finance” process and brings visibility to financial indicators for 
CFOs and financial professionals during the critical days before financial state­
ments are made publicly available. It connects EPM data to iOS mobile through 
BI, ensuring full security on corporate data, and it leverages data from the finan­
cial consolidation software part of the EPM suite. Key financial indicators are dis­
played in current/constant currency and with/without M&A effects to provide 
CFOs with the complete vision on consolidated data.
SAP Financial Results Insight includes a set of prebuilt indicators—consolidated 
revenue, profit and loss, income and return on equity, revenue by geographical 
area, cash flows, financial ratios, and tax impact—that can be easily customized or 
enriched by business end users according to their enterprise needs.
Figure 11.5 through Figure 11.9 all show images from the SAP Financial Results 
Insight application.
11.3
Summary
Financial reporting is the main purpose of the financial close process. Different 
organizations will have many different requirements. Customers must work 
closely with SAP, their other software vendors, and their implementation part­
ners to develop the best reporting strategy for their company. The financial close 
action plan in Chapter 2 is a great place to start.

For many people in Finance, the economic crash of 2008 was the first 
time in their careers that they had experienced a serious recession. It was 
simply no longer business as usual, and the future looked very uncertain. 
This chapter looks at how finance will need to evolve and how this might 
impact reporting.
12
The Future of Finance and Its Impact on 
the Financial Close
As Chapter 2 describes, the last stage in any financial close project is to establish 
a foundation for ongoing improvements or, at the very least, the ability to main­
tain the close times delivered as part of your project. This inherently looks to the 
future. It would not have been appropriate to close out this book without also 
looking to how the future role of finance is likely to evolve and understanding its 
impact on the use of technology and the financial close.
Given the complexity of the finance organization, its breadth, and the internal 
and external stakeholder community, predicting the future of such an organiza­
tion is uniquely challenging. This chapter has been structured to look at the future 
impact and role of finance across four key dimensions that we will deal with in 
turn, looking at the impact of future changes, how technology impacts this, and 
what it means for the financial close:
 Economic environment and the role of finance
 Financial operations
 Managing stakeholder expectations
 Ensuring regulatory compliance
12.1
Economic Environment and the Role of Finance
The economic crisis that started in 2008 was, for many, a new experience and was 
the first time they had experienced a serious recession. It was no longer business

as usual, and facing up to it required special resilience. The anxiety and stress 
involved in realigning their businesses with the new reality and having to let staff 
go left deep scars that no one wants to suffer again soon—and let’s hope that is 
the case.
In the months immediately after the crisis, what needed to be done was obvious, 
and many companies took the knife to expenses and discretionary spending with 
the result that many are sitting on cash reserves that collectively run to trillions of 
dollars. The finance and controlling department was of course critical to this pro­
cess. In many respects, this indirectly highlights the importance of a string finan­
cial close process, one of the benefits of which is more time for value-added 
activities, which might well include the time and ability to support the type of 
stewardship required under such economic circumstances. However, five years 
later, consumer demand remains febrile with many western economies still strug­
gling to deliver sustainable economic growth and suggesting that it will take 
another five years to turn the corner. So burdened with burgeoning cash reserves 
needing to be invested on one hand, but faced with low growth and persistent 
economic uncertainty on the other, it is no surprise that CFOs and finance profes­
sionals are concerned about the future.
As part of SAP’s ongoing research into the future role of finance, we commis­
sioned a study published in January 2013 to examine the economic outlook and 
see how this was impacting finance professionals and their priorities. Conducted 
by Bloomberg BusinessWeek Research Services, the “Finance as Analytical Part­
ner to the Business” research report surveyed CFOs and finance professionals 
from around the world and from a range of industries what their expectation was 
regarding the global economic outlook over the next 18 months. As Figure 12.1
shows, only a quarter were expecting growth of more than 3%, about half 
expected growth under 3%, and the remaining quarter were looking at some kind 
of decline.
The same survey asked about the expectation of the economic outlook for the 
organizations they worked for over the next 18 months, and a similar pattern 
emerges with only 31% expecting growth greater than 3%. Earlier in this book, 
we mentioned that the prospect of more regulation was one of the few certainties 
we could count on, perhaps another is simply that that times were easier a decade 
ago.
If there is any good to come out of the past five years, it has to be that the crisis 
has accelerated the transition of the role of finance from custodian and bean

counter to business partner. It has been written about in the journals of the 
accounting profession for decades, but has only been realized in recent years so 
that today, CFOs and their teams are expected to take a leading role in developing 
and delivering strategies to create value for investors and other key stakeholders.
It is clearly a challenging time to be exalted into such a prominent position, but 
CFOs and finance professionals are confident with nearly every piece of research 
suggesting they are armed and ready to exploit the green shoots of any returning 
economic growth. At the time of writing, the more recent quarterly figures com­
ing from some countries give support to their optimism; in others, the recovery is 
far from certain, and many will likely experience a long and drawn out climb back 
to economic health. No matter where you look around the globe, it is clear that 
the best thing that finance can do is to build a strong, flexible balance sheet and 
focus on financial performance. Although some companies that were weak prior 
to 2008 failed spectacularly during the global downturn, many reined in expenses 
and are in good financial health. As economic uncertainty continues, we can rea­
sonably expect the impact on the role of finance, particularly controlling staff to 
move more and more in this same strategic direction, making the need for a fast 
and efficient close process as important as it has ever been.
So from the uncertain position of today, let’s examine the priorities for finance 
for the next decade or so across their three areas of responsibility: to manage

financial operations to deliver a superior service and drive down costs; to outper­
form on the financial objectives their company has promised to stakeholders and 
to ensure that profitability is sustainable in the future; and finally to ensure that 
their company has effective governance and risk management processes in place 
and complies with external regulation—one of the main concerns of this book as 
it relates to the financial close.
12.2
Financial Operations
Knowing that profitable growth would be hard to come by in the immediate 
future, many businesses wisely invested some of the cash sitting on the balance 
sheets to drive process improvements and automation that would protect profit 
margins in the short term. Much of this investment was driven by chief operating 
officers (COOs), who many suggest may be eventually responsible for managing 
core financial processes—an interesting prospect for many managing the financial 
close process no doubt. But for the moment, that is not the case in most compa­
nies, and it was finance that grasped the opportunity to address any remaining 
weaknesses in core areas, such as the financial close, payables, receivables, and 
budgeting, that had been tolerated for far too long.
With a dual thrust to improve efficiency and productivity, anything that can be 
done to reduce departmental costs and ultimately drive down the overall cost of 
finance as a percentage of revenue has to be welcomed in the current climate. 
This is good news for those using cost as a key part of their business case for a 
financial close initiative today and in the immediate future.
As indicated in Chapter 1, with vast amounts of benchmarking data available, 
organizations can now easily see where they stand across a whole range of 
detailed criteria to help them focus on cost saving. Traditionally, this was, if any­
thing, restrict to data about the cost of finance, often expressed as a percentage of 
revenue, but now details such as the proportion of journal entries made manually 
and the cost of general accounting per journal entry line item are available, which 
allows a greater level of granularity in cost-saving processes. What’s more, 
because most best-in-class companies have already been through some form of 
financial process improvement program, such as a financial close program, they 
are now able to apply the same lessons, better able to quantify the benefits, and 
yield a time to value, which is often surprisingly quick as our section of financial

12.2
close quick wins in Chapter 2 indicates. Therefore, it should come as no surprise 
that despite a fragile economy, spending on core financials—software for billing 
and collections, and investment in shared services—has remained remarkably 
buoyant. Such investments are low-hanging fruit, and analysts have repeatedly 
written that if you cannot justify investment in core financial processes in the cur­
rent environment, then perhaps you never will.
As a case in point, the SAP survey run by Bloomberg BusinessWeek Research Ser­
vices also looked at technology investment and best practices, asking finance pro­
fessionals which technology functions or practices their company plans to use in 
the next two years to achieve their business goals. While the results for the indi­
vidual areas themselves are perhaps not surprising, when looking at them as a 
whole, all of these have applications within the financial close process and the 
wider evolution of finance as a whole. We’ll come back to this several times in 
this chapter, but as Figure 12.2 illustrates, the first two areas we want to look at 
in more detail are real-time reporting, and embedding analytical functions into 
existing financial systems. These come out as the top two priorities, and both are 
extremely relevant to finance operations. SAP’s roadmap for finance delivers on 
both areas.

12.2.1
SAP Business Suite Powered by SAP HANA
SAP announced early in 2013 that SAP Business Suite would run on SAP HANA to 
deliver numerous innovations for a number of lines of business, including 
finance. These innovations include those directly impacting the financial close, 
such as automatic reconciliation with automated real-time matching, a single 
repository for company and corporate data, and deeper and faster insight down 
to the lowest level of detail. Other innovations delivered with SAP Business Suite 
on SAP HANA will impact other parts of finance as well, including the following:
 More efficient payables management processes by providing immediate 
insights into account payables and days payables outstanding (DPOs), real-time 
access to comprehensive purchasing reports, and increased transparency about 
selection criteria, allowing payment of dedicated items
 More efficient receivables management processes by allowing users to investi­
gate drivers of changes in days sales outstanding (DSOs) and therefore working 
capital, and the provision of real-time insight on credit ratings, disputes, and 
open invoices to sales teams on any device
 Improved compliance and access control processes, including real-time analy­
sis of role usage, faster identification of similarities between roles, and the abil­
ity to combine role data coming from different sources (e.g., HR systems)
 New central treasury exposure management, which includes a central integra­
tion platform at the headquarter level, the inclusion of real-time market data, 
and the flexible aggregation and slice and dice of real-time treasury data
12.2.2
Embedded Analytics
As Section 12.2.1 indicates, the SAP Business Suite innovations, enabled through 
SAP HANA, are driving toward more analytic functions. However, SAP has and 
will continue to embed additional content within SAP ERP Financials directly 
addressing the desire of finance professionals for more analytics functions in 
existing financial systems.
Enhancement packages 5 and 6 (EhP5 and EhP6) for SAP ERP Financials delivered 
a broad range of prebuilt reports and dashboards based on the SAP BusinessOb­
jects Business Intelligence (BI) 4.0 release. These reports and dashboards deliver 
analytics directly within SAP ERP at the point where a user is engaged in a key 
finance or business process. As a result, they enable greater insight and decision 

Managing Stakeholder Expectations
265

making across a range of financial operations, including cash, collections, credit, 
and dispute management.
Given such innovations in the area of finance operations and the desire of finance 
professionals to plan for their future adoption as the Bloomberg BusinessWeek 
research shows, we believe there is big opportunity for finance to develop an 
even stronger business case and investment strategy for technologies to support 
the financial close. In the future, this will also fuel the opportunity for more quick 
wins or continuous improvement within the close process. So as teams look 
beyond the immediate financial close objectives they have set, it will become 
more important to understand how the broader technologies described in this 
chapter will impact future finance and controlling operations.
However, while this investment in short-term efficiency can and should be taken 
as a positive in the context of the financial close, the long-term prospect of these 
types of efficiency savings is somewhat limited. Such process improvements 
eventually suffer from the law of diminishing returns and will never be sufficient 
to sustain profitability or alone deliver growth, something every CFO is now anx­
iously helping their companies to identify and successfully exploit. This is essen­
tially what is accelerating CFOs and finance professionals in their quest to 
function as a true partner to the business.
12.3
Managing Stakeholder Expectations
As Section 12.1 explains, it has been written about in the journals of the account­
ing profession for decades that CFOs and their teams are expected to take a lead­
ing role in developing and delivering strategies to create value for investors and 
other key stakeholders. However, as we have just described, it has only started to 
materialize in recent years. As the office of finance seeks to manage expectations 
across the business, new challenges will arise. In particular, as finance evolves in 
the future, it’s crucial that key accounting staff and processes evolve to support 
this move from stewardship to strategy. Fail to do that, and those processes and 
people run the risk of being marginalized while finance continues to change. As a 
result, we believe that it’s critical for those working in the financial close process 
to develop a greater understanding of how Enterprise Performance Management
(EPM) processes are changing and how supporting technology innovation creates 

The Future of Finance and Its Impact on the Financial Close
266
12
new opportunities to make the financial close more strategic as part of an overall 
performance management framework.
This is perhaps most easily highlighted by the uncertainty of recent years, which 
rapidly demonstrated the inadequacy of many planning, budgeting, financial 
reporting, and cost management systems to support the business, just at the time 
when finance was being tasked with working alongside their peers to help shape 
and deliver strategy that produced sustainable growth and profitability.
If finance is really going to deliver in this new role of helping to identify and cap­
italize on emerging growth opportunities and steering their companies through 
the challenges that are endemic in the current business climate, many CFOs are 
coming to realize that they need to invest in business processes and solutions that 
are not only “up to the job” but also give them the insight and time to act in the 
new capacity. This means implementing planning and budgeting cycles that can 
be counted in days rather than weeks or months; having management and finan­
cial reports that give insight into the operational variances that underpin the 
numbers and can lead to better decision making; and having all of this informa­
tion as fast as possible while there is time to act on it. In the context of this book, 
we are addressing the core reporting piece, but this highlights the need to then 
apply the learning to other business processes as Chapter 2 outlines under the 
guise of continuous improvement.
Somewhat fortuitously, the advent of better performance management solutions, 
new technologies such as in-memory processing that are fundamental to real-time 
reporting, and the ability to proactively provide information to managers on their 
mobile devices no matter where they happen to be, are all available today. These 
methods are being rapidly adopted as companies seek to bolster their capabilities 
and ensure they have performance management systems that will help them 
make better decisions than their competitors.
These new technologies, such as in-memory computing, not only deliver quicker 
information but also better discernment by providing insight into data that was 
previously effectively inaccessible. In turn, the role technology plays in enabling 
better business processes and in leading the CFO and his team to act in this new 
capacity is critically important.
For example, after you start to analyze profitability across multiple dimensions, 
(e.g., customer, channel, SKU, day of week, period, version, etc.), the volumes of 
data result in slow calculating models and tiresome queries. Today, with cost and

profitability solutions powered by in-memory calculation engines, the speed of 
processing is dramatically improved—think seconds rather than hours. There is 
also no limit to the depth of analysis, so that managers can gain instant reports on 
the profitability of individual product variants supplied to each one of their cus­
tomers’ outlets through a complex manufacturing and supply chain. At a time 
when improved profitability depends on the cumulative accretion of small 
improvements in margins throughout the value chain, being able to effectively 
mine “big data” is a definite competitive advantage.
Likewise, the need to be agile in order to survive the uncertainty of this persistent 
economic downturn has made companies realize the need to move to a state of 
perpetual planning with rolling reforecasts that can be quickly and easily up­
dated.
Example: Professional Services
Let’s take professional services as an example in that many people reading this book will 
probably work in such an organization. The financial plan is typically set at the beginning 
of the year and—sometimes—updated during the year. In addition to this, there are 
sales forecasts based on a weighted sales pipeline and a resource forecast based on sold 
work and nearly sold work, including holidays. In addition, there will be actuals of sales, 
revenue and resource usage, and absence. The resource managers will want to be able 
to ask questions, such as the following:
 If we sell these key projects, what will the impact on revenue and recruitment be?
 What are the areas for which I don’t have a mid-term pipeline to fill current expected 
resource demand?
 Where are the areas of resource in which I have least availability?
In this situation, both the revenue and risk profile change very quickly, and changes in 
demand or supply or even totally unexpected events such as a volcano erupting require 
a decision to be made immediately. So although a planning and budgeting application 
may not sound like a typical big-data solution, when you include detailed sales and 
operations plans, products plans and so on, you can easily be talking about hundreds of 
thousands of records—especially when a company is dealing with snapshot versions, 
matrix planning, and reference data. As we see more complexity grow within our busi­
ness network, we will see an increasing need for solutions built on in-memory calcula­
tion engines that enable planning and budgeting to happen in real time with new 
forecasts being rapidly pushed down into the business so they can quickly realign to the 
latest changes. More and more, the task of planning will become a big-data problem.
Having the finance team work alongside its business colleagues to drive revenue 
growth and profitability has also made many CFOs realize the need to extend

performance management systems so they span the traditional divide between 
financial and operational data. This has led to a growing number of companies 
implementing driver-based planning and budgeting where key inputs (and KPIs), 
such as productivity ratios, the sales pipeline, the unit cost of inputs, exchange 
rates, and the like, can be actively monitored and managed on a daily basis with 
corrective action taken as required. Such an approach can be a much-needed cat­
alyst that will facilitate and accelerate the path for finance to work alongside the 
business as true partners.
Again technology has become an enabler. Until now, driver-based budgeting 
models have been somewhat onerous to work with in that recalculating a large 
multi-dimensional planning model that contains a lot of business rules that span 
time periods and departments could take considerable time even when models 
have been partitioned across servers and the ingenious workarounds have been 
brought into play. Similarly, updating sales and operational drivers relied on 
waiting until contributors found some quiet time to open their laptop, which is 
never easy with managers who are out in the field or based in a busy production 
or distribution unit.
Today, any inputs that are not system generated can be collected using mobile 
devices with the process automated by workflows so that reminders and tem­
plates flash up on the screen ready for the two or three critical bits of data to be 
entered. And as drivers are typically things that any manager will be routinely 
monitoring as part of his daily work, it takes seconds to submit the data. Sec­
ondly, building planning models that make use of in-memory calculation engines 
means that that even the biggest driver-based planning and forecasting models 
will run in real time. That way, everyone in the business from a junior line man­
ager to the CEO can get instant insight into where they stand against their goals 
and targets. What’s more, because the model is based on drivers, automated vari­
ance analysis will show them exactly which issues need to be addressed, and they 
can run scenarios to assess the impact of any changes that need to be made.
Admittedly, finance would need to plan the collection of drivers starting with 
sales and working through production, distribution, and finally back office, 
repeatedly calculating the model so that contributors could see what demands the 
new forecasts of earlier upstream contributors make on their own responsibility 
center. It may take a couple of elapsed hours to generate a new forecast, but com­
ing from four to six months, surely this is as near real-time planning and budget­
ing as possible.

Managing Stakeholder Expectations
269
12.3
As highlighted in Section 12.2, CFOs and finance are now looking to adopt such 
solutions in the next two to three years, and similarly SAP’s innovation strategy 
and roadmap support this.
12.3.1
In-Memory Powered Planning, Budgeting, and Forecasting
As the previous section clearly demonstrates, planning, budgeting, and forecast­
ing, as well as profitability and cost management are processes that demonstrate 
compelling use cases for in-memory computing. While the idea is not new, it has 
not traditionally been enabled on packaged EPM suites. By introducing SAP Busi­
ness Planning and Consolidation powered by SAP HANA in early 2012, SAP not 
only delivered a packaged in-memory powered planning and budgeting solution 
but also one which uniquely in the market is unified with a consolidation and 
reporting engine. The benefits of this extend much further than mere processing 
speed, and it allows for a whole new type of planning, budgeting, and reporting 
that links strategic, financial, and operational planning together on a single plat­
form and manages the associated big-data challenge that comes with it. Such a 
solution should therefore form part of the future design of EPM implementations 
and should be intrinsically linked and integrated within financial close projects.
12.3.2
Predictive Analytics and Data Discovery
Moving beyond planning, budgeting, and forecasting, there are other areas that 
additionally support the ability for finance professionals and those in the close 
process to become more strategic, and, like the other examples we have 
described, they too are seen as priority areas for investments according to the 
Bloomberg BusinessWeek research. The ability to leverage more advanced analyt­
ics in the form of predictive capabilities has been around for decades, but today 
new market forces are changing the landscape and creating new opportunities for 
its application. With data volumes exploding, organizations need to extract the 
maximum possible value, whether from transactional financial or sales data typi­
cally generated within the enterprise or from unstructured data created by exter­
nal sources such as social media. The introduction of in-memory technology has 
dramatically reduced the time and cost of data processing and makes it possible to 
perform predictive analysis against vast volumes of data in real time. The spectac­
ular growth of the open-source statistical and data mining language “R” has 
empowered a new breed of data scientists with a vast array of analytical possibil­
ities at their fingertips. To address this need, SAP has introduced a brand new 

The Future of Finance and Its Impact on the Financial Close
270
12
solution, SAP Predictive Analysis to provide users from across the enterprise with 
an intuitive, productive environment for data modeling and advanced data visu­
alization. Analysts use its drag-and-drop visual interface for data selection, prepa­
ration, and processing. They create models by using native, predictive algorithms, 
and by employing algorithms from R, users can gain deeper knowledge that 
reveal hidden insights. The solution integrates with SAP HANA to unlock the 
value of big data and with BI solutions to extend predictive insight to thousands 
of business users. Such a solution therefore directly addresses the desire of 
finance professionals to anticipate outcomes rather than just better understand 
past performance.
At the same time, the evolution in desktop-based data discovery solutions is driv­
ing increasing numbers of finance professionals to invest directly, and often out­
side of centrally managed IT business intelligence initiatives, to obtain solutions 
they can use to further analyze financial data, visualize it, and share the insight 
with others. This is particularly sought after as finance uses the financial close to 
free time to answer ad hoc questions from management. SAP therefore continues 
to innovate in this area, and in mid-2012, introduced SAP Visual Intelligence, 
which delivers a simple point-and-click interface that creates graphical visualiza­
tions allowing the user to quickly analyze data. It does this in a completely self-
service way and accelerates decision making with immediate, fact-based answers 
to complex business questions. The powerful combination of such predictive ana­
lytics and data discovery tools dramatically and most importantly quickly 
expands the capabilities finance teams can use either directly within the financial 
close process or as part of a wider EPM initiative.
12.3.3
Mobilizing Finance
The final innovation we want to highlight in this area and which should certainly 
form a part of all future financial close projects is the role of mobility. The 
Bloomberg BusinessWeek research showed that a quarter of all respondents 
wanted to deliver financial information to employees’ mobile devices. The case 
for this requires little explanation as the value of giving key stakeholders and 
decision makers the ability to review up-to-date and trusted financial information 
wherever their increasingly strategic role takes them speaks for itself. But it rep­
resents significant challenges. First, you must have the technology to display and 
visualize financial data on a mobile device, but you also have to allow people to 

Ensuring Regulatory Compliance
271
12.4
interact with it and take action. In addition, we are talking about mission-critical 
and highly sensitive financial data, so securing the data and the device is essential. 
As a result, SAP has introduced several solutions to help users achieve their aims 
of delivering financial information to mobile devices. This includes the combina­
tion of the SAP BusinessObjects Mobile App and the SAP BusinessObjects 
Explorer Mobile App, which both enable users to review and interact with any 
form of business data, including financials on a mobile device. In addition the 
forthcoming release of the SAP EPM Unwired solution provides a direct mobile 
interface for EPM solutions such as SAP Business Planning and Consolidation, 
exposing key parts of the financial close and planning cycle to a mobile device. 
Other transactional mobile solutions also support the financial process, including 
the SAP Payment Approvals application, which speeds the payables management 
processes, and SAP Customer Financial Fact Sheet, which delivers key financial 
information about customers to frontline staff. All of these solutions are powered 
by the SAP Mobile Platform, which secures both data and device.
Clearly these are just examples, but for those involved in the financial close pro­
cess, they highlight a key trend. First, that CFO and finance responsibilities are 
changing; second, that technology, much like in the close process, is enabling this 
change; and, most importantly, that investments in improving the financial close 
and making it more strategic are a key contributor to achieving the new role. 
Given the shift is only likely to accelerate, positioning financial close projects in 
this context seems advantageous.
12.4
Ensuring Regulatory Compliance
The third core responsibility of finance centers on risk management, reporting, 
and compliance, which are at the very heart of this book. Initially, you might 
think this is the most mature area of finance, subject to the least change, and one 
that the CFO can afford to pull back from. However, that is far from the case as we 
have mentioned throughout this book.
Being able to close books fast, deliver reports on time to support fact-based deci­
sions, and ensure regulatory compliance is critical for every business. But with 
growing amounts of ledger, cost, and material data held in various ledgers, this is 
not always possible as running detailed interim reports needed as part of the 
close process means lots of dead time. In some situations, there is so much data in 

The Future of Finance and Its Impact on the Financial Close
272
12
material and production cost ledgers that it is virtually impossible to run a 
detailed analysis without severely jeopardizing month-end routines.
Technologies such as in-memory computing means all those issues disappear, 
which speeds critical steps in period-end routines. At the same time, these tech­
nologies also help drive productivity because despite considerable levels of 
unemployment across western economies, finding suitably qualified staff appears 
to be the biggest issue for finance functions across the world, and many are 
resorting to interim professionals to make up the numbers. It might be necessary, 
but it’s likely to drive up the overall cost of the finance function in the long run. 
Some of these interim professionals are probably helping out with the growing 
burden of compliance—something many CFOs predict will take up more of their 
time—and reporting, which in recent years appears to be somewhat stuck in the 
doldrums.
On average, it is taking businesses longer to produce their annual draft financial 
statement and to file statements with the respective regulatory agencies. Now 
while this is perhaps understandable as companies are generally being extra cau­
tious with their external reporting in the current climate, many companies are 
still reconciling their accounts manually, which compromises both quality and 
productivity. Similarly, recent research shows that less than a quarter of U.S. 
companies have started to report in IFRS and less than 1 in 10 have automated 
XBRL tagging or the disclosure and publication process, both of which are 
requirements that are essentially in the pipeline already but continue to evolve 
globally.
What’s more concerning is that with so few companies addressing known or 
imminent challenges to reporting, who knows how well those responsible for 
financial reporting will cope with new challenges. Two such changes that could 
be potentially very disruptive are taxation and integrated reporting, which we 
explain further in the following sections.
12.4.1
Taxation
With many governments pulling back on public spending that is directly impact­
ing many vulnerable groups in society, it’s not surprising that people and the 
press are making noise about the amount of tax paid by the super-rich and some 
of our global companies. Although they are complying with regulations, most 

Ensuring Regulatory Compliance
273
12.4
international companies currently minimize their tax exposure by repatriating 
high royalty fees for using their brands, transferring pricing service fees for IT 
and the like, and basing their entities in countries with low rates of corporate tax­
ation.
Many governments seem to be pressing for changes such as unitary taxation 
where companies are taxed according to the genuine economic trading they do in 
each country coupled with some form of minimum tax payable locally, which 
would be determined by looking at the global profit of a company and then 
applying a formula based on where sales are made and where people are 
employed to allocate a fair share of the taxable profit to each country. Should 
such regulation come into force, it will mean that every company that trades out­
side its national borders will need to make an annual submission to the tax 
authorities of each country where it does business. This submission will combine 
the consolidated accounts for the whole global group that ignores all internal 
transfers and shows the group’s physical assets, workforce, sales, and the overall 
profits, which are broken down by country according to the weighting set out in 
the final formula. Now if you thought getting ready for IFRS or XBRL was a chal­
lenge (albeit challenges that continue to evolve on a worldwide basis), step back 
and reflect on the internal implications of this. Overnight, the number of pub­
lished reports has gone through the roof as one needs to be submitted in each 
country where you trade.
12.4.2
Integrated Reporting
Integrated reporting poses similar issues, although it includes a wider opportu­
nity as well. The changes, including the possible introduction of a new Interna­
tional Integrated Reporting Framework, are being driven by the Integrated 
International Reporting Council (IIRC) (www.theIIRC.org). The IIRC is a coalition 
of investors, regulators, companies, standard setters, members of the accounting 
profession, and non-governmental organizations, which was established to pro­
mote the view that communication about businesses’ value creation needs to be 
at the center of the evolution of corporate reporting. The group is leading the 
development of a global framework for integrated reporting that has potentially 
profound impacts on the way organizations report and the role of finance in this 
process.

The Future of Finance and Its Impact on the Financial Close
274
12
What Is Integrated Reporting?
Integrated reporting is a process that results in communication, most often in the form 
of a periodic “integrated report” about value creation over time. An integrated report is 
a concise communication, an explanation to an interested party, about how an organi­
zation’s strategy, governance, performance, and prospects lead to the creation of value 
over the short-, medium-, and long term. An integrated report should be prepared in 
accordance with the International Integrated Reporting Framework. While the commu­
nications that result from integrated reporting will be of benefit to a range of stakehold­
ers, they are principally aimed at providers of financial capital allocation decisions.
This is based on the growing realization that a wide range of factors determine the value 
of an organization. Some of these are financial or tangible in nature and are easy to 
account for in financial statements (e.g., property, cash), while many are not (e.g., peo­
ple, natural resources, intellectual capital, market and regulatory context, competition, 
energy security). Integrated reporting reflects the broad and longer-term consequences 
of the decisions organizations make based on a wide range of factors in order to create 
and sustain value. Integrated reporting enables an organization to communicate in a 
clear, articulate way how it is drawing on all the resources and relationships to create 
and preserve value in the short-, medium-, and long term, which helps investors to 
manage risks and allocate resources most efficiently.
The IIRC believes that the current corporate reporting framework needs to evolve to 
reflect the wide range of factors that affect corporate performance. The current focus on 
an organization’s financial statements is insufficient to determine the value of the orga­
nization. Financial reporting covers both financial performance and risk, and this will 
remain an important part of the reporting universe; it is, however, insufficient by itself to 
provide all of the information that users now need for rational and high-quality decision 
making. In a scenario where the majority of the information available to investors is his­
toric, they are required to navigate a course around the next corner with reference only 
to a rearview mirror as if there were no road ahead. Integrated reporting is the route 
map that supports investment decision making, reflective of the integrated thinking and 
decision making within organizations.

More than 80 companies, including SAP, are participating in the pilot program 
that aims to provide feedback on the key building blocks of such a reporting 
framework, as well as create and drive business momentum toward its implemen­
tation. As the IIRC indicates, to some extent, this is a continuation of numerous 
previous discussions about the value of non-financial data to key stakeholders, 
but the work and aspirations of the IIRC go much further. We would certainly 
lend our support to a framework like this and recognize the value of such an 
approach. Moreover, we would advocate that even today, companies should be

taking steps, perhaps as part of the disclosure management process, to incorpo­
rate a broader reporting framework as part of their financial close processes.
Implementing this globally will be not be easy for the IIRC and will be potentially 
disruptive for companies as well, especially in today’s economic conditions. How­
ever, the value to stakeholders is clear and further underlines the need for flexible 
and adaptable reporting processes, so understanding the implications sooner 
rather than later seems appropriate.
It’s clear that the global financial crisis has stepped up the pressure from investors 
and regulators for accounting and reporting processes that are rock solid with no 
errors, faster reporting, and agility in dealing with new disclosure requirements, 
such as these which certainly raise the bar on transparency. But with a scarcity of 
suitably qualified finance professionals to recruit from and an increasing work­
load due to compliance and reporting, this will not be easy. Clearly there has to 
be a change in the level of investment in financial systems to improve productiv­
ity and flexibility in financial processes and to allow existing head count to get on 
with addressing compliance and reporting challenges.
12.5
Summary
In discussing how the role of finance is likely to evolve across its three main areas 
of responsibility—managing financial operations, helping the business outper­
form on its financial objectives, and ensuring regulatory compliance—it is appar­
ent that none of these challenges has diminished in recent years. What’s more, 
we can expect all of them to grow in importance in the coming years, placing ever 
greater demands on CFOs and their teams to be more effective, most likely with 
fewer resources. They will have to keep all of these plates in the air—and we have 
not even mentioned other activities such as mergers and acquisitions that are 
making a comeback as companies use some of their cash piles to acquire new rev­
enue streams.
Thankfully, advances in financial systems and technologies are keeping in step in 
this endless pursuit for effectiveness and efficiency. So much so that when some­
one comes to write the history of the IT industry in the first quarter of the twenty-
first century, it might well be referred to as a “golden age.” They may also write 
that it came at a very opportune moment! Retrospectively, it may also be the 
golden age of the CFO and finance, when after years of promises, they finally

occupied a more central role working alongside their commercial colleagues to 
help analyze, quantify, and compare growth opportunities and risks, and ensure 
that sufficient resources are available so they can effectively and efficiently 
deliver optimum profitability.
But we should not assume that it’s always going to be a harmonious partnership. 
Finance will always be a custodian of costs, both in driving down the cost of their 
own department and in critically reviewing the costs and profitability of the 
resources, products, and customers in individual business units as is discussed in 
this research. Likewise, finance will have a central role in allocating resources and 
even rejecting or curtailing someone’s cherished business opportunity in favor of 
another that is able to demonstrate a greater return. Sometimes, they will have to 
simply say, “No.” But ultimately, supported by performance management solu­
tions that provide better insight and timelier decision support, their commercial 
peers will recognize the undeniable value they bring to the business.

Conclusion
The aim of this book was to provide finance and controlling professionals with 
the insight to understand how existing and future investments in SAP solutions 
can be leveraged to help organizations run a best-in-class finance close process. 
By taking a broad view of SAP’s portfolio of finance and analytics solutions from 
SAP ERP Financials through to applications from the market-leading enterprise 
performance management, business intelligence, and governance, risk and com­
pliance portfolios, we have explained how such solutions could be systematically 
deployed to break down traditional barriers to a fast, high-quality financial close 
process.
Through the structure of this book, we have taken you through a series of best-
practice steps that will help you and your organization structure and execute a 
successful, fast high-quality financial close project using these key technologies, 
but we have also set this in the context of process change and people. There are a 
number of key takeaways we encourage you to keep central to your own projects 
and which are articulated with the four-step action plan, starting with a broad 
understanding and definition of the business problem and ending with an ongo­
ing process of continuous improvement.
The first of these really forms the foundation for everything else, and therefore 
the definition of your company’s vision for a fast close is of critical importance. It 
should span the benefits you want to achieve, the barriers your organization 
faces, and the articulation of your objective, which is typically an expression of 
how quickly you want to close based on benchmark comparisons with your 
regional or industry peers. Together, these help drive strong sponsorship, which 
is critical for any successful transformation initiative such as a fast-close project.
The second key takeaway is the need to identify your “quick wins,” which are 
designed to allow you and your teams to make a positive impact on the financial 
close process with relatively little effort. Resolving data collection errors or prob­
lems within the intercompany reconciliation process, for example, can go a long 
way to helping an organization close its books with the speed and quality it 
desires.

Conclusion
278
13
As we have described, bigger, more time-consuming and complex actions, our so-
called “big wins,” are needed to help you reach your objective and identifying the 
right areas is critical and something we encourage you to examine in detail. By 
definition, “big wins,” including the implementation of new financial consolida­
tion or disclosure management solutions, which become platforms on which 
broader change can be delivered, come with a cost and effort that may require 
their own business case.
Finally, we cannot emphasize enough the importance of ensuring that all of this 
needs to be wrapped up in a culture of change management and ongoing contin­
uous improvement that not only looks at the financial close process itself but also 
looks beyond it to other associated finance processes, including planning, budget­
ing, and forecasting. Continuous improvement should seek to understand how 
changes to the financial close process can positively be applied to these associated 
processes and by the same measure how a change to planning and budgeting may 
positively or negatively affect the close process itself. Understanding the wider 
changing regulatory landscape and how technology continues to evolve should all 
be part of this process.
As we have done in the structure of this book, you should use these four steps as 
a guide but subsequently look in detail at specific functions. Move beyond the 
definition of the project framework to demonstrate how specific applications and 
innovations can deliver both speed and quality to the financial close process and 
address the barriers you will have identified.
With all of this in mind, we wanted to draw this book to a close with a few final 
thoughts and observations to help you on your way. First, it’s unlikely this book 
is being read out loud around a table and perhaps more unlikely to be featured on 
a book club reading list. Instead, it’s far more likely that you are an individual 
either interested in learning a little more about the financial close and how you 
can make a difference or perhaps you are already charged with speeding the close 
process at your organization. At this point, it may seem like there is a mountain 
to climb, and it’s difficult to know where to start. In part, the aim of the action 
plan is to provide such guidance but in all the financial close projects the authors 
have worked on, they almost all started with a single individual driving a vision 
for change. This is both the challenge and the opportunity. As you approach this 
challenge, talk to your peers and seek out other like-minded individuals within 
your organization and beyond your organizational boundaries. Attend conferences

and talk to people at organizations that have already been through such a process. 
There are plenty of like-minded and experienced people out there, and most will 
jump at the opportunity (assuming you’re not their competitor) to share their 
experiences. We have included a number of real-life customer case studies in this 
book, but SAP offers many more either as written case studies or as references, 
and you should actively seek to engage with as many as you can. Include your 
auditor and appropriate consulting firms in this dialogue because although we 
have seen many organizations make incremental improvements on their own, the 
structure and experience such consulting firms can bring is highly valuable in the 
larger, more transformative financial close initiatives (note that your own auditor 
may be restricted from offering certain consulting services due to local indepen­
dence rules).
Second, look at this book for what it is: a guide, not a prescription. As the book 
highlights a number of times, particularly early on, there is often no right or 
wrong answer, especially in terms of how fast your own close process should be. 
Defining such targets is subjective, and the use of this book is much the same. 
Absolutely this is designed to support your efforts as part of a formal financial 
close transformation process, but it can just as easily serve as a guide for how to 
best maximize the value of your existing SAP landscape further, that is, “sweating 
the assets” as it is often referred, or to simply help you identify future selection 
criteria as you consider new technology investments. This flexibility is typical of 
a financial close process, and often the best financial close projects are the ones 
designed with your organizational needs and resources at their heart. One size 
does not fit all, and we have tried to reinforce this message within our structure.
Finally, the success of finance as a whole is something that should be defined, 
measured, and reported on by a range of KPIs and not just on how fast you close 
your books. Just as you have identified the areas you need to focus on in your 
financial close project by benchmarking your performance, the finance organiza­
tion as a whole needs to establish KPIs that demonstrate how the finance team is 
creating value. For example, KPIs such as cost of finance as a percentage of reve­
nue or days sales outstanding (DSO) are highly measurable, comparable to peer 
groups, and demonstrate success. We strongly believe that you should encourage 
your organization to measure its performance in such a way and that naturally 
you should build the speed of close into this framework as a key measure of 
overall finance effectiveness. This focus will create a platform by which you can 
build new business cases, compete for scarce internal resources, identify new

opportunities, and further demonstrate how innovation within financial close 
processes can add value to finance and the business as a whole.
In closing, the financial close is a business-critical process. They say time and tide 
will stop for no man, and the same is true of the financial close. Good or bad, fast 
or slow, it has to be done, but it need not be a painful process, and it certainly 
should be a process that adds real value to the organization and that helps you 
become a true strategic partner to the business. Good luck.
