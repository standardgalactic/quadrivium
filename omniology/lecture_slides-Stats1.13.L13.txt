Moderation & Mediation 
•  Moderation and Mediation may sound 
alike but they are quite different 
– Moderation (Lecture 13) 
– Mediation (Lecture 14) 
– Both demonstrated in R (Lab 7)

An example 
•  X: Experimental manipulation 
– Stereotype threat 
•  Y: Behavioral outcome 
– IQ test score 
•  Z: Moderator  
– Working memory capacity (WMC) 
7 
Moderation 
•  A moderator variable (Z) will enhance a 
regression model if the relationship 
between X and Y varies as a function of Z

Moderation 
•  Experimental research 
– The manipulation of an IV (X) causes change 
in a DV (Y) 
– A moderator variable (Z) implies that the 
effect of the IV on the DV (X on Y) is NOT 
consistent across the distribution of Z 
9 
Moderation 
•  Correlational research 
– Assume a correlaton between X and Y 
– A moderator variable (Z) implies that the 
correlation between X and Y is NOT 
consistent across the distribution of Z 
10 
Moderation 
•  If X and Y are correlated then we can use 
regression to predict Y from X 
•  Y = B0 + B1X + e 
•  CAUTION! 
•  If there is a moderator, Z, then B1 will NOT be 
representative across all Z 
–  The relationship between X and Y is different at different 
levels of Z  
11 
Moderation model 
•  If both X and Z are continuous 
– Y = B0 + B1X + B2Z + B3(X*Z) + e

Moderation model 
•  If X is categorical* and Z is continuous 
– Y = B0 + B1(D1) + B2(D2) + B3Z +  
 
 
 
 
 
 B4(D1*Z) + B5(D2*Z)  e 
 
*3 levels of X 
 
13 
How to test for moderation 
•  If both X and Z are continuous 
– Model 1: No moderation 
•  Y = B0 + B1X + B2Z + e
  
– Model 2: Moderation  
•  Y = B0 + B1X + B2Z + B3(X*Z) + e 
 
 
14 
How to test for moderation 
•  If X is categorical* and Z is continuous 
– Model 1: No moderation 
•  Y = B0 + B1(D1) + B2(D2) + B3Z + e 
– Model 2: Moderation  
•  Y = B0 + B1(D1) + B2(D2) + B3Z +  
 
 
 
 
 
 B4(D1*Z) + B5(D2*Z) + e 
 
15 
How to test for moderation 
•  Compare Model 1 and Model 2 in terms of 
overall variance explained, that is, R2 
– NHST available for this comparison 
•  Evaluate B values for predictors 
associated with the moderation effect 
– (X*Z) 
– (D1*Z) and (D2*Z)

Back to the example 
•  X: Experimental manipulation 
– Stereotype threat 
•  Y: Behavioral outcome 
– IQ test score 
•  Z: Moderator  
– Working memory capacity (WMC) 
17 
Simulated experiment & data 
•  Students completed a working memory 
task 
•  Students then randomly assigned to one of 
three experimental conditions 
– Explicit threat (n = 50) 
– Implicit threat (n = 50) 
– Control (n = 50) 
•  Students then completed an IQ test 
18 
Simulated experiment & data 
•  Experimental condition is categorical so 
dummy coding is required  
– Let the Control group be the referent 
– Let D1 = Explicit threat 
– Let D2 = Implicit threat

Centering predictors

Centering predictors 
•  To center means to put in deviation form  
•  XC = X - M  
•  Why center? 
– Two reasons 
•  Conceptual 
•  Statistical 
Centering predictors 
•  Conceptual reason 
– Suppose  
•  Y = child’s verbal ability 
•  X = mother’s vocabulary 
•  Z = child’s age 
Centering predictors 
•  Conceptual reason 
–  The intercept, B0, is the predicted score on Y when 
all predictors (X, Z) are zero 
–  If X = zero or Z = zero is meaningless, or 
impossible, then B0 will be difficult to interpret 
–  In contrast, if X = zero and Z = zero, are the 
average then B0 is easy to interpret 
Centering predictors 
•  Conceptual reason 
–  The regression coefficient B1 is the slope for X 
assuming an average score on Z 
–  No moderation effect implies that B1 is consistent 
across the entire distribution of Z

Centering predictors 
•  Conceptual reason 
–  In contrast, a moderation effect implies that B1 is 
NOT consistent across the entire distribution of Z 
–  Where in the distribution of Z is B1 most 
representative of the relationship between X & Y? 
–  Let’s look at this graphically…

Centering predictors 
•  Statistical reason 
– The predictors, X and Z, can become highly 
correlated with the product, (X*Z) 
•  Multicolinearity: when two predictor variables in a 
GLM are so highly correlated that they are 
essentially redundant and it becomes difficult to 
estimate B values associated with each predictor  
Segment Summary 
•  Centering predictors 
– Convert raw scores to deviation scores 
•  XC = X – M  
•  Reasons for centering 
– Conceptual 
•  Regression constant will be more meaningful 
– Statistical 
•  Avoid multicolinearity
