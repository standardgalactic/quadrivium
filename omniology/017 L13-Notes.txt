Infrared line sensor 
An infrared line sensor is a simple device made up of an infrared emitting LED and an 
infrared sensitive photo-resistor. 
You could use one of these sensors to build a robot that follows a dark line on the ﬂoor, or 
your own heart rate monitor. 
The principle of operation is very simple: The transmitter produces infrared light which 
bounces of a surface and comes back to be captured by the photo-resistor. The more 
infrared light is reﬂected back into the photo-resistor, the 
higher the output of the sensor gets. 
In our experiment we will use a QRE1113 line sensor from 
Sparkfun. You can get something like this on eBay for 
less than $2. 
Assembly 
Let's puts together this circuit and test out the motion 
sensor. 
We will need: 
• The Arduino 
• Three jumper wires 
• An QRE1113 line sensor or equivalent 
(like this ywRobot device). 
Here's what we are going to build (right). 
For power, you can plug this sensor into 
either the 3V or 5V sockets on the Arduino.

Sketch 
This one is very simple, just read the analog output at pin A0 and print it to the monitor: 
// Line Sensor Breakout - Analog 
int out; 
void setup() 
{ 
 
Serial.begin(9600); // sets the serial port to 9600 
} 
void loop() 
{ 
 
out = analogRead(0); // read analog input pin 0 
 
Serial.println(out, DEC); // print the value of the sensor 
 
delay(100); // wait 100ms for next reading 
}
