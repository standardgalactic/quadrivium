HyperX Announces New TKL 
Keyboard For Pro-Level Gamers
HyperX, the division of Kingston Technology that pro-
duces high-performance PC products, has announced a 
new addition to its Alloy keyboard line. The HyperX Alloy 
FPS Pro is a mechanical gaming keyboard that offers red 
LED backlighting and a choice of Cherry MX keyswitches 
(Red, Brown, or Blue). The Alloy FPS Pro is a tenkeyless 
model with a solid-steel frame and is designed for eSports 
professionals and pro-level players who like compact 
keyboards they can take on the road. There are presets for 
six lighting effects, as well as five brightness levels. The 
braided cable is 1.8 meters long and can be detached for 
travel. Other features of the Alloy FPS Pro include 100% 
anti-ghosting, N-key rollover, and a 1,000Hz polling rate. 
MSRP for the Alloy FPS Pro is $79.99. HyperX says the 
keyboard will be available at retailers starting August 21. 
Swiftech Has New, 
Limited-Edition Blocks
Swiftech has announced the Heirloom Series, a collection 
of cooling products that can be customized in a number 
of ways. The first product to be released in the new series 
is the Apogee SKF waterblock. At the heart of the Apogee 
SKF is new cooling engine technology. Swiftech says the 
block has fins that are only 125 microns thick (less than 
five-thousandths of an inch), and that this technology puts 
it a generation ahead of any competitors. The Apogee SKF 
is available in hundreds of color and finish combinations; 
there are five finishes for the top, six choices for the cover 
plates, eight colors for the logo, and two colors for the 
block’s mounting brackets. The MSRP for the new Apogee 
SKF Heirloom Series is $94.95. Swiftech says it has already 
begun producing customized orders for the new block, and 
that it will only be sold for four weeks or until the existing 
stock of cooling fins has run out, whichever comes first.

EKWB Creates M.2 NVMe Heatsink
EKWB specializes in liquid coolers and accessories, but 
the company occasionally branches out into other areas. 
Today the manufacturer released a new passive heatsink 
for NVMe SSDs that use the m.2 protocol. The EK-M.2 
NVMe Heatsink is a compact heatsink that comes in black 
acetal or nickel. It’s compatible with all m.2 devices that are 
single-sided and that use the 2280 format (22mm in width 
and 80mm in length). Those restrictions are important, 
as the heatsink has a front and a backplate that are held 
in place with small clips as they sandwich the SSD. The 
heatsink has raised ribs for raditating heat. EKWB says its 
NVMe heatsink can cut the SSD temps in your system by 
about 8 to11 degrees by itself, and reduce them even more 
if you have a sufficient level of airflow. The EK-M.2 NVMe 
Heatsink is available for $12.99 (black) or $14.99 (Nickel) 
from EKWB’s online store.
Team Group Announces Delta RGB 
Memory maker Team Group has formally announced 
its newest line of DDR4 memory. The company gave 
previews of the new T-Force Delta RGB memory kits at 
Computex in June. The Delta RGB memory comes with 
an all-new heatsink that Team Group says is thinner and 
lighter than previous heatsinks because it is made with 
an “improved, high-quality metal.” The company says 
the new material helps dissipate heat faster. The heatsinks 
come in black or white. Team Group also is emphasizing 
the RGB capabilities of its new memory, and says it will 
be compatible with ASUS Aura Sync after a BIOS update 
from ASUS. The memory comes with a default LED mode 
the company calls “Force Flow,” but supports a total of 
nine lighting effects. The Delta RGB is available in kits 
of 8GB (4GB x 2) and 16GB (8GB x 2) at speeds of 
2400Mtps, 2666Mtps, or 3000Mtps. Pricing for the new 
kits has not yet been released.
The ASRock H110BTC+ Supports 
A Baker’s Dozen Of Graphics Cards
ASRock’s H110 Pro BTC+ is a motherboard designed for 
mining digital currency. The board can run an incredible 
13 AMD graphics cards at once, or a hybrid mix of AMD 
and NVIDIA graphics cards totaling up to 13 GPUs. 
To accommodate the power needs of all those cards, the 
motherboard has an 8-phase power design and three extra 
power connectors. (ASRock says users may need to add another 
PSU, as the company recommends at least 2400W of power if 
you are driving 13 GPUs. You’ll need to buy a separate dual-
power supply adaptor cable if you run a secondary PSU.) For 
miners wanting to run 13 AMD cards, ASRock recommends 
downloading the ethOS LINUX-based mining OS. The 
company recommends downloading GUIMiner for users who 
want to run a mix of AMD and NVIDIA cards. The ASRock 
H110 Pro BTC+ retails for around $130.

HARDWARE MOLE
Thermaltake Claims World First With 
Launch of iRGB PLUS PSU Line 
Thermaltake first announced its iRGB Toughpower Premium 
Edition power supply at Computex in June. The company said 
the power supply was the “world’s first” to offer an RGB palette 
with 16.8 million colors. Now the PSU has been formally 
launched and is available at retailers. Enthusiasts who buy the 
new PSU will get a powerful, single-rail unit that is 80 PLUS 
Titanium certified for efficiency. The PSU has a Riing 14 RGB 
fan and a dozen LEDs that can be controlled individually. 
There are four lighting speed options (Slow, Normal, Fast, and 
So Fast), as well as seven lighting modes (Pulse, Wave, Ripple, 
Blink, RGB Spectrum, Flow, and Full Lighted). The unit is fully 
modular and supports Thermaltake Smart Power Management 
and other Thermaltake programs that help monitor and 
maintain power and also hold down system noise. The MSRP 
for the iRGB PLUS 1250W Titanium PSU is $399.99.
Case Labs Unveils Bullet BH8 EATX  
The compact Bullet chassis series from Case Labs is adding 
a big brother. The company has an EATX version coming 
that is roomy enough for custom liquid-cooling loops, 
but measures just 11.25 x 14.25 x 15 inches (HxWxD). 
The BH8 case has dual side windows plus a window on 
top for showing off components. Inside the 10-pound, 
all-aluminum chassis you’ll find a removable motherboard 
tray in the top compartment; the PSU goes in a lower 
compartment. There are up to a dozen mounting locations 
for SSDs, and the case comes with one HDD cage, but you 
can have as many as six with additional mounts). There are 
eight PCI slots. Fan mounts include two 120/140mm on 
top, two 120/140mm in front, and 2 x 80mm in the rear of 
the lower compartment. Case Labs says the MSRP for the 
Bullet BH8 is $249.95; it will ship in early August. 
ADATA Announces XPG GAMMIX
ADATA has launched a new memory line called XPG 
GAMMIX D10. The DDR4 memory is available in factory 
speeds up to 3000MHz. The black PCBs on the modules 
have 10 layers to reduce signal interference, and there’s a 
heatshield (available in red or black) with the XPG logo 
and a serrated top that sandwiches the PCB. ADATA 
claims the heatshield gives the memory “considerable” 
headroom for overclocking. The XPG GAMMIX D10 
modules are available in capacities ranging from a 
single 8GB module on up to 64GB (16GB x 4) and at 
2400MHz, 2800MHz, and 3000MHz speeds. Kits at the 
first two speeds run at 1.2V, while the 3000MHz (PC-
2400) kits run at 1.35V. ADATA says the memory modules 
offer great stability for overclockers. Pricing and availability 
dates for the new memory have not yet been announced.

The meeG App Lets You Turn Your 
Selfies Into Customized Emojis 
Bad Apps, a company that doesn’t take itself too seriously, 
has created a new app for people who like to express 
themselves frequently on social media. The app, called meeG 
(and pronounced MEE-jee) makes it easy for users to turn 
their selfies into emojis that they can then send to friends in 
texts or chat sessions. Versions of meeG are available for both 
iOS (in the App Store) and Android (on Google Play). After 
you download the app for your smartphone, you go into 
your phone’s settings to add the meeG keyboard. Then you 
take a selfie, and the app walks you through the process of 
creating your personal emoji from the image. You can create 
dozens of meeg images and build your own emoji library. 
When you send a message to someone, you can attach your 
meeg (selecting the one you want from the meeG keyboard) 
just like you would with a regular emoji.
Skrite Is A Social Networking App 
That Wants You To Watch The Sky
A new social networking app has launched that lets users 
communicate through a clever mix of augmented reality and 
geospatial messaging. Users download the app and then are 
able to virtually “skywrite” (hence the app’s name) messages 
that appear to float like contrails in the air at a particular 
location. You can only skrite a message at your current 
location, and once you skrite in a particular zone, you “own” 
the sky in that zone (a max of 25 Skrites can be written to a 
zone). Other users of Skrite can simply point their phones at 
the sky to see the messages people have left. You also can leave 
private Skrites; these messages can only be seen by people 
you designate. Another fun twist: you can connect with other 
Skrite users worldwide and “teleport” using AR to see Skrites 
written in the air around the globe. Visiting Paris? Leave a 
message there floating in the air for a loved one to find later. 
Skrite is available for free at the Apple App Store.

Most Broadband Households 
Watch Internet Video On The TV 
Market research firm Parks Associates has been studying 
entertainment in the IoT era, and has found that just over 
50% of U.S. households with broadband service are viewing 
Internet videos on their TVs. The firm says this marks a 
critical shift for the television industry, saying “the market 
has fundamentally changed.” While broadcast and cable 
networks continue to see declines in viewership, the use of 
OTT (Over The Top) services is growing. More than 60% of 
U.S. households now subscribe to at least one OTT service, 
and Parks says one-third of households say they subscribe 
to multiple services. Other findings: 72% of non-pay-TV 
households subscribe to an OTT service, and 88% of video 
watching on computers is from non-linear sources. Nearly half 
(49%) of U.S. broadband households subscribe to Netflix, 
making it by far the most popular OTT service in the U.S. 
Online Aftermarket For Car Parts 
Continues To Grow As Millennials Age
Millennials are very active online, and as they age and their 
purchasing power grows, they are creating seismic changes 
in different industries. Nearly 44% of millennials spend half 
or more of their overall purchasing dollars online, according 
to a report by research firm NPD Group, and now the car 
parts industry is feeling the effect. NPD says millennials 
are coming into their peak driving years, and they’re now 
buying more aftermarket parts for their cars. They’re also 
reading reviews online before making their purchases and 
watching videos about how to do car repairs. About 12% 
of all aftermarket car part purchases are now made online, 
and the percentage is growing. More than a quarter of after-
market interior accessories, brake drums and rotors, and 
alternators are now bought online. The most popular online 
aftermarket segment is auto paint, where nearly a third 
(31%) of purchases are made online. 
SITE SEEING
Want The Real Scoop? Ask A Moo’er
LocalMoo is a new website that seeks to connect travelers 
around the world with local experts from their targeted travel 
destinations. These locals, which the site calls “Moo’ers,” are 
able to earn income on LocalMoo by acting as an information 
resource or offering travel-related services to travelers headed 
their way. Travelers can make arrangements with Moo’ers to 
pick them up at the airport or to act as their travel guide to 
local points of interest. They can ask Moo’ers for their advice 
on the best places to stay or restaurants that serve authentic 
local cuisine. LocalMoo says people who live in a community 
and who share their knowledge about the local area are able to 
help tourists or business travelers get more out of their visits. 
The travel platform says it has already built a following and has 
local Moo’ers available from more than 50 countries. For more 
information on how the site works, visit localmoo.com.

Job Of The Month
The jury is still out on whether VR will become as prevalent in consumer households as TVs or gaming 
consoles, but a number of major companies continue to plow R&D dollars into the technology. Among the 
leaders in the consumer VR space is HTC with its well-regarded Vive headset. The company is currently 
looking for a Senior Software Developer in Virtual Reality for HTC Creative Labs in San Francisco. This 
person will create applications for the HTC Vive and new product prototypes and explore new user 
experiences made possible by VR technology. Ideal candidates will have serious technical chops and a 
designer’s eye. You need five or more years of development experience in games or apps, plus you need 
to be a wiz with C# and the Unity game engine. You’ll collaborate with teams and individuals in Taipei as 
well as San Francisco. VR experience is a big plus. If you want to be on the cutting edge of technology, VR 
is at the tippy tip. Plus you get to travel occasionally to Taiwan! See the website below for details.

Goggles = Gaming
Virtual reality may help businesses train 
employees and help doctors with complex 
surgeries, but for most consumers, VR means a 
new way to game. Nearly 9% of U.S. broadband 
households will buy a VR headset in the next 
12 months, according to a report by Parks 
Associates. About a quarter of households 
say they will use the devices for educational 
purposes and shopping. Around a third say 
they will use them to watch sports or other 
live events and for social interaction. Almost 
half intend to take virtual tours or watch 
entertainment videos. But two-thirds say they 
will use VR headsets to . . . yup . . . play games.

Civilized Behavior? That’s So Passé, You Moron
It’s a rough world out there. Tales of bad behavior are legion on the interwebs, but the problem goes 
far beyond ill-mannered retorts and childish name-calling. Pew Research Center surveyed more than 
4,000 U.S. adults about their online experiences and found that 41% had been the victims of some form 
of abusive behavior. The online abuses ranged from name-calling to stalking and sexual harassment. 
Ten percent of adults 
have received threats of 
physical violence over 
the internet.  In all, Pew 
says about one in five 
Americans have been 
the victims of severe 
forms of harassment, 
including stalking or

Off-The-Shelf Custom 
CORSAIR Has What You Need To Bring Your Mod To Life

else: A lot of the components that help make 
this mod a custom showpiece are parts you 
can buy from your favorite retailer—parts 
that are made and sold by Corsair.
Crystal Series 570X RGB
Seasoned modders will tell you that 
choosing the right case can make or break 
any mod project, and for the see-through, 
chrome-and-glass look that Bolognesi was 
going for, the choice was clear: Corsair’s 
Crystal Series 570X RGB.
This gorgeous ATX mid-tower case comes 
with tempered-glass panels on both sides, on 
the front, and on top, so it does an incredible 
job of showing off your components—and 
your hard work inside. It is also designed for 
it great. “He always looks at his builds 
from a perspective that’s different from all 
the other builders I’ve ever worked with,” 
Corsair’s Blake Andes says. “He built it with 
a completely monochrome color scheme to 
give that opulent appeal, but then added 
in a splash of color with the purple coolant 
and purple LEDs.”
Andes says Bolognesi used a CNC 
machine to mill out CrystaliZed’s custom 
acrylic reservoir and water channels, and adds 
that he also has access to a laser cutter. “The 
nickel-plated tubing is his perfect finishing 
touch, and it totally adds the extra ‘pop,’ 
giving it that cherry-on-top appeal,” he says.
But if you take a closer look at this 
breathtaking mod, you’ll notice something 
W
hat makes a mod great?
If you think back to the most 
amazing PC projects you’ve ever seen, 
you’ll very quickly come to the realization 
that the thing they have in common is 
that they don’t look like anything else 
you’ve ever seen. Take, for example, 
Daniel Bolognesi’s “CrystaliZed” mod, 
a featured build in Corsair’s Builder 
Showcase (www.corsair.com/en-us/landing/
builders-showcase). Odds are pretty good 
that you’ve never seen anything quite like 
it; it’s a one-of-a-kind work of art, and 
it’s the kind of mod that makes everyone 
who sees it wish they’d built it.
And to be sure, Bolognesi put work 
and imagination into this mod to make 
Daniel “Twister” Bolognesi’s custom masterpiece, “CrystaliZed.”
12 August2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

effects you need to complete your perfect 
look, especially when used in conjunction 
with Corsair LINK software. In addition, 
these gorgeous kits support XMP 2.0 
overclocking profiles, are built on custom 
performance PCBs with tightly screened ICs, 
and have great-looking heat spreaders that 
also maintain optimal operating temps so 
that your memory is stable regardless of what 
you throw at it.
Premium Individually 
Sleeved PSU Cables
Bolognesi cut custom power supply 
cables to precise lengths and sleeved 
them himself for CrystaliZed, and they 
look great. If you’ve ever sleeved your 
own cables, though, you know that it is a 
pretty significant time commitment, and 
it requires a very particular set of skills. 
If you lack either the time or the skills, 
Corsair has even more good news for 
you: the company’s Premium Individually 
Sleeved PSU cables are sleeved in paracord 
and come in multiple colors and color 
combinations so that you can get that 
custom look anyway.
Corsair cables also come in a variety 
of kits to help you get precisely the cable 
lineup you need, and they even come with 
cable combs so that everything stays right 
where it belongs at all times.
Get It Together
Creating your best mod yet still requires 
some work on your part, of course. There’s 
no substitute for attention to detail and a 
good eye, but thanks to a wide range of 
great-looking, high-performance parts from 
Corsair, making your next build look great 
just got a lot easier. ■
Vengeance RGB DDR4
When you’re working to create a 
coherent color scheme inside your build, 
it’s important to avoid installing memory 
sticks that break it up rather than 
contribute to that theme. CrystaliZed has 
Vengeance LED memory modules with a 
custom paint job, but the white glow of 
their LEDs does just as much to pull the 
look together as the paint.
Corsair’s Vengeance RGB DDR4 memory 
lets you add the specific colors and lighting 
maximum airflow, to keep your components 
cool and help them perform better, longer.
HX Series HX1000
The power supply in “CrystaliZed” 
has a custom finish, but beneath the paint 
this unit is all Corsair. It provides kilowatt 
power, 80 Plus Platinum efficiency, and runs 
extremely quietly thanks to its 135mm fluid 
dynamic bearing fan, which uses Corsair’s 
ZeroRPM mode to shut down completely 
when it’s not needed. The HX1000 also 
comes with legendary Corsair reliability, 
thanks to 100% Japanese capacitors rated for 
105-degree Celsius operation; the entire unit 
is engineered to provide maximum power 
output at 50 degrees Celsius, and comes with 
a 10-year warranty.
Best of all from an aesthetic standpoint, 
the HX1000 is a fully modular PSU, so you 
will only ever have to work with the cables 
you need for the hardware in your build—
and that makes it easier to keep your system 
looking clean and immaculate, even in a 
see-through case.
HD Series RGB Fans
Corsair fans have been keeping PCs 
cool for years, and the company provides 
a wide range of options, including both 
static pressure and high-airflow units to 
cover all the bases. HD Series RGB fans 
have 12 individually addressable RGB 
LEDs built into the frame and four built 
into the hub, giving you complete control

Patriot Hellfire SSD, and GIGABYTE’s 
XP1200M provided system power. None 
of the boards we tested had any conflicts 
with this hardware setup.
MSI X299 GAMING M7 ACK
MSI typically releases a GAMING 
M7 variant for each new chipset, and 
the board often comes packed with 
amenities for performance enthusiasts. 
The X299 GAMING M7 ACK stays 
true to our expectations with support 
for high-speed memory, RAID 
configurations for PCIe SSD sans Intel 
VROC (Virtual RAID On CPU), 
Mystic Light RGB sync, built-in Killer 
wired and wireless connectivity, and 
voltage check points.
The X299 GAMING M7 ACK is 
built to handle the power and heat 
of Intel’s Core X-series processors. 
To optimize power delivery, for 
instance, there are 12 power phases 
with load-line calibration and digital 
power control. The mainboard boasts 
an 8-pin EPS and a 4-pin ATX CPU 
power inputs, ideal for power-hungry 
Skylake-X processors. Similar to the 
other boards in this roundup, MSI 
installs an external clock generator that 
allows for a greater range of BCLK 
adjustments. The rear panel boasts a 
Clear CMOS button, as well as a BIOS 
FLASHBACK+ button to conveniently 
recover from any OC missteps.
MSI equips the motherboard with 
eight DIMM slots and includes a full-
page handout that illustrates which 
slots you should use when installing 
system memory, depending on your 
processor. It’s a small enough thing, 
On X299, Intel provides the chipset 
with up to 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes to power 
multiple 32Gbps M.2 slots, PCIe 3.0 
expansion slots, USB 3.1 ports, and 
other high-speed connectivity. X299 
also natively supports up to 10 USB 3.0 
ports and eight SATA ports.
As is typical with a processor architecture 
change, X299 brings along a new socket 
called LGA 2066, so you won’t be able 
to use a Broadwell-E or Haswell-E 
processor. The LGA 2066 socket will 
support upcoming Core X-series chips, 
including the 18-core, 36-thread 
Core i9-7980XE. Intel Core X-series 
processors connect to the X299 chipset 
via a DMI 3.0 link, just like Intel uses 
on the mainstream Z170 and Z270 
chipsets. The high-speed link offers 
up to 8GTps per lane and helps to 
support the additional flexibility of the 
X299 chipset.
Besides a common chipset, an 
attribute you can expect all X299-based 
motherboards to share is a comparatively 
costly price tag, with base models 
starting around $250. Most X299 boards 
retail for more than $300. If you pair 
X299 with a Skylake-X CPU, you’ll 
understandably want to surround the 
processor with other premium parts. 
Our X299 roundup takes a look at three 
motherboards with plenty of enthusiast-
oriented additions.
To get the most out of the mother-
boards in this roundup, we installed 
Intel’s Core i9-7900X, an EVGA GeForce 
GTX 1080 Ti FTW3 GAMING, 
and 32GB of Corsair Vengeance LED 
DDR4-3200MHz memory. Optimal 
storage speed was provided by a 480GB 
I
ntel’s Core X-series processors are a 
dramatic shift for the HEDT (high-end 
desktop) platform. The biggest change 
is that there are two CPU lineups, 
Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X, with vastly 
different architectures. By segmenting 
its Core X-series chips, Intel is able to 
expand power user choices, but there 
are some serious side effects. X299 
motherboards support both processor 
lineups, yet available memory and GPU 
configurations will differ based on the 
CPU you choose. 
Opting for a Kaby Lake-X CPU, 
for example, limits a system to dual-
channel memory and the CPU only 
contributes 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes. 
Skylake-X, on the other hand, delivers 
what power users have come to expect 
from the HEDT platform, with support 
for quad-channel memory and up to 
44 PCIe 3.0 lanes (with a minimum 
of 28 lanes). Both Skylake-X and 
Kaby Lake-X processors can support 
four PCIe 3.0 storage lanes from 
the processor, and the extra lanes 
on Skylake-X allow for a bit more 
flexibility for GPU and PCIe SSD 
configurations. For these reasons and a 
few others, we expect most enthusiasts 
to opt for a Skylake-X processor when 
building around X299.
The X299 chipset itself is another big 
HEDT transformation, and the changes 
on X299 are almost all for the better. 
Its predecessor, Intel’s X99 chipset, was 
severally hampered for use with PCIe 
SSDs, because the chipset only had 
eight PCIe 2.0 lanes. As such, most X99 
motherboards steal PCIe 3.0 lanes from 
the CPU to feed PCIe SSD bandwidth.

active, even if you install PCIe SSDs 
into both M.2 slots.
The X299 GAMING M7 ACK’s 
onboard wireless is provided by Killer’s 
Wireless-AC1535 module that fits 
into the Key E M.2 slot near the rear 
I/O panel. The preinstalled module 
supports 802.11ac at up to 867Mbps 
and Bluetooth 4.1. The rear panel’s 
wired connection is Killer’s E2500 
NIC, and the Killer Network Manager 
can utilize the wired and wireless 
connections to optimize network 
traffic for gaming duties.
MSI installs RGB LEDs in the heat-
sinks and the rear I/O cover, and we 
particularly like the set of LEDs in the 
VRM heatsink that loom like a pair of 
eyes over the CPU socket. The board 
includes one RGB LED header to sync 
a 5050 LED strip with the LEDs on 
the motherboard (and other Mystic 
Light-compatible devices), and MSI 
includes a splitter to let you connect a 
second RGB LED strip.
The X299 GAMING M7 ACK 
delivered some of the best benchmark 
scores of the test group. In SiSoftware 
Sandra’s Processor Multi-Media 
tests, for example, the mainboard 
was measurably faster than the other 
boards. SiSoftware Sandra’s Memory 
Bandwidth Integer test (61.52GBps) 
and CrystalDiskMark’s Sequential 
read/writes (2650MBps/984.3MBps) 
were two other benchmarks where the 
X299 GAMING M7 ACK flexed its 
compute muscles.
Based on features and peak perfor-
mance, the X299 GAMING M7 
ACK is our favorite model in this 
roundup. Of course, it’s also the most 
expensive motherboard (with an MSRP 
of $399.99), so it should probably 
perform the best. Even at $100 more 
than the ASRock X299 Taichi, MSI 
deserves kudos.
ASRock X299 Taichi
The X299 version of ASRock’s 
Taichi features a clockwork theme, 
just like previous Taichi models, with a 
few more intricate details that enhance 
There are also two PCIe 3.0 x1 slots, 
powered by the X299 chipset, for other 
add-on cards.
The two PCIe x1 slots reside next 
to the two M.2 slots. MSI installs its 
M.2 Shield FROZR over the M.2 slots 
to provide built-in thermal protection. 
Unlike the small metal M.2 Shield on 
MSI’s Z270 motherboards, the Shield 
FROZR on the X299 GAMING M7 
ACK is a large, thick metal block. 
MSI still preinstalls a thick thermal 
pad to help draw heat away from your 
M.2 SSD. The two M.2 slots utilize 
lanes from chipset, and you can use 
MSI’s M.2 Genie to set up a high-
speed RAID. MSI also includes a U.2 
port, and this 32Gbps port will remain 
but we appreciated the simplified 
installation. Optimized trace layouts 
allow the X299 GAMING M7 ACK 
to support high-speed modules. MSI 
qualifies the quad-channel memory 
support at up to DDR4-4133, while 
dual-channel memory support goes up 
to DDR4-4500MHz.
For expansion slots, there are four 
PCIe 3.0 x16 slots wired to operate at 
x16/x4/x16/x8 speed when paired with 
a 44-lane CPU. Up to 3-way SLI and 
CrossFire is supported on both 44-
lane (x16/x16/x8) and 28-lane (x8/x8/
x8) processors. With a 16-lane CPU, 
MSI allows for SLI and CrossFire 
(at x8/x8), but interestingly, a single 
GPU is only given x8 bandwidth. 
Specs: Max memory: 128GB (DDR4-2667; Max OC: DDR4-4500); Slots: 4 PCIe 3.0 x16 (2 at x16, 1 at x8, 1 at 
x4), 2 PCIe 3.0 x1; Storage: 2 M.2 (1 type 2242/2260/2280, 1 type 2242/2260/2280/22110), 1 U.2, 8 6Gbps 
SATA; Rear I/O: 2 USB 3.1 (1 Type-A, 1 Type-C), 4 USB 3.0, 2 USB 2.0, 1 PS/2, 1 Ethernet, audio I/O, 1 S/PDIF, 2 
Wi-Fi antenna ports, 1 BIOS FLASHBACK button, 1 Clear CMOS button; Form factor: ATX; Warranty: 3 years

headers that support 5050 RGB strips 
with a maximum power rating of 3A 
and a length of two meters or less. 
Interestingly, the RGB LED behind 
the PCH heatsink is the only onboard 
LED. The visual aesthetic of the board 
might be a bit more intriguing for 
modders and enthusiasts with a few 
more RGB LEDs, especially if the LEDs 
further accented the gear theme. 
The ASRock X299 Taichi benchmark 
numbers lagged ever so slightly behind 
the competition in most cases, but none 
of the results were particularly alarming. 
For example, the POV-Ray 3.7 score of 
4549 is only 29 points behind the top 
mark. The X299 Taichi did produce 
the best score in SiSoftware Sandra’s 
ASRock adds wireless communication 
by preinstalling an Intel 802.11ac/
Bluetooth 4.2 combo module on the 
rear panel. For a truly speedy wired 
connection, the X299 Taichi features 
two Intel LAN ports (one i219V and 
one i211AT) that support teaming. One 
important caveat is that teaming isn’t 
supported on Windows 10, which could 
prove problematic for power users. The 
rear panel also features two USB 3.1 
ports (one Type-A and one Type-C), four 
USB 3.0 ports, and two USB 2.0 ports. 
ASRock includes support for front-panel 
USB 3.1 connectivity via an ASMedia 
ASM3142 chip.
To control and sync RGB LED 
lighting, ASRock offers two RGB LED 
the look. For example, ASRock adds 
a thick, metal gear-shaped PCH 
heatsink, and there are RGB LEDs 
under the gear that provide a cool 
backlight. ASRock also drops the white 
elements in favor of a grey, silver, and 
black color theme that feels more 
industrial. To drive performance, the 
X299 Taichi boasts a 13-phase power 
design, three 32Gbps M.2 slots, and 
four PCIe 3.0 x16 slots wired at x16/
x8/x16/x8 speed.
ASRock lays out the X299 Taichi’s 
expansion slots a bit differently than 
the other models in this roundup. MSI 
and GIGABYTE electrically wire the 
second PCIe x16 slot for x4, while the 
X299 Taichi allows for up to x8 speed. 
Despite not being listed as such in the 
manual, ASRock tells us that the second 
PCIe x16 slot can be used for a 4-way 
SLI or CrossFire configuration. We also 
like that the board allows for 3-way SLI 
and CrossFire (x8/NA/x16/x8) when 
used with a 44-lane or 28-lane CPU.
When using a Kaby Lake-X CPU 
that’s limited to 16-lanes, the X299 
Taichi only supports a CrossFire 
configuration—no SLI—at x8/x4 
speeds. The four missing PCIe lanes 
are reserved for one of the three M.2 
slots on the motherboard. Lack of 
support for SLI is something we rarely 
see even on relatively affordable boards 
with mainstream chipsets like Z270; 
this is just another reason we’d strongly 
recommend a Skylake-X processor for 
people investing in X299.
For system storage, ASRock provides 
three Key M, M.2 slots. There are 
two slots (M2_1 and M2_3) fed by 
the chipset and the one powered by 
your Core X-series CPU. On the 
other boards in the roundup, MSI and 
GIGABYTE provide tools to create 
a RAID with the chipset M.2 drives. 
On the X299 Taichi, you’ll need to 
go through the process of remapping 
the drives via Intel Rapid Technology, 
which is a lot more time-consuming 
than using a custom-made utility. A 
3-way RAID with PCIe SSDs with 
M.2 drives requires Intel VROC. 
Specs: Max memory: 128GB (DDR4-2667; Max OC: DDR4-4400); Slots: 4 PCIe 3.0 x16 (2 at x16, 2 at x8), 1 
PCIe 2.0 x1; Storage: 3 M.2 (2 type 2230/2242/2260/2280/22110, 1 type 2230/2242/2260/2280), 10 6Gbps 
SATA; Rear I/O: 2 USB 3.1 (1 Type-A, 1 Type-C), 4 USB 3.0, 2 USB 2.0, 1 PS/2, 2 Ethernet, audio I/O, 1 S/PDIF, 2

feature a WS2812 LED controller that 
supports digital LED strips, rings, or 
matrices where you can address the 
color and brightness of individual 
LEDs. As such, you can create color 
patterns and unique lighting effects. 
The X299 AORUS Gaming 3 includes 
one digital LED header (for 5050 
digital LED strips) and two RGBW 
headers (for 5050 RGB or RGBW 
strips). You can control colors and 
effects for connected strips via the 
RGB FUSION utility and the BIOS. 
The X299 AORUS Gaming 3 boasts 
a few onboard RGB LEDs, though 
not nearly as many as what you’ll 
find on the Gaming 9 and Gaming 7. 
For example, this motherboard lacks 
If you pair the X299 AORUS 
Gaming 3 with a Skylake-X processor, 
the motherboard supports up to 
128GB of quad-channel DDR4 
memory over eight DIMM slots. But 
similar to other X299 mainboards, the 
X299 AORUS Gaming 3 will disable 
half of the DIMM slots if you install 
a Kaby Lake-X CPU (due to its dual-
channel architecture) and limit you to 
four DIMM slots and 64GB of system 
memory. GIGABYTE has qualified 
DDR4 modules as fast as 4200MHz 
for Skylake-X and up to 4400MHz for 
Kaby Lake-X CPUs.
GIGABYTE continues to evolve 
its support for RGB LEDs with its 
X299 AORUS lineup. The new boards 
Processor Arithmetic tests, but as with 
POV-Ray 3.7, numbers were quite 
similar between all three motherboards.
ASRock makes some nice additions to 
the X299 chipset, such as the onboard 
Wi-Fi, USB 3.1 front-panel header, 
and dual Intel NICs. We’d have liked to 
see an easier way create a RAID 0 or 1 
configuration with PCIe SSDs, but it’s 
not a deal-breaker. Overall, the X299 
Taichi’s sharp looks, overclocking options, 
and power user enhancements make it 
worthy of a Skylake-X CPU.
GIGABYTE X299 AORUS Gaming 3
The X299 AORUS Gaming 3 isn’t 
GIGABYTE’s top-of-line AORUS 
board, yet it still includes several of 
the amenities found on the higher-end 
AORUS X299 mainboards. It’s also a 
good example of the base features you’re 
likely to see with X299 motherboards, 
such as dual M.2 ports. 
The two M.2 ports on the X299 
AORUS Gaming 3 are hosted by the 
chipset, rather than the CPU, and 
GIGABYTE easily supports RAID 0 and 
1 configurations without the need for an 
Intel VROC upgrade key. (On the X299 
AORUS Gaming 9 and 7, a third M.2 
slot is hosted by the CPU and can only 
RAID with other PCIe SSDs using Intel 
VROC.) If you’re planning a RAID with 
SATA SSDs, this board supports RAID 
0, 1, 5, and 10 configurations—even if 
they are M.2 SATA SSDs. 
All of the expansion slots on the 
X299 AORUS Gaming 3 are PCIe x16 
slots, though only two (the top and 
third slot) are wired for the full x16 
speed. The bottom PCIe x16 slot is 
wired for x8 speed, while the second 
and fourth slots are wired for x4 
speed. This layout allows for plenty of 
space between the true x16 slots and 
maximizes airflow for SLI or CrossFire 
configurations; 3-way CrossFire and 
SLI are also supported if you use a 44-
lane CPU, though the slot wired for 
x8 speed is next to the bottom of the 
PCB. Depending on your case, adding 
a third GPU might require the use of a 
single-slot card. 
Specs: Max memory: 128GB (DDR4-2666; Max OC: DDR4-4400); Slots: 5 PCIe 3.0 x16 (2 at 
x16, 1 at x8, 2 at x4); Storage: 2 M.2 (1 type 2242/2260/2280, 1 type 2260/2280/22110), 8 
6Gbps SATA; Rear I/O: 2 USB 3.1 (1 Type-A, 1 Type-C), 6 USB 3.0, 1 PS/2, 1 Ethernet, audio

RGB LEDs in between the DIMM 
slots and the rear I/O cover, which 
leaves the upper portion of the board 
comparatively dark. The entire lineup 
lacks the LED strip along the right side 
of the board—a feature we liked on 
many AORUS Z270 motherboards.
In our benchmark results, the X299 
AORUS Gaming 3 put the 10-core, 
20-thread Core i9-7900X to good use 
in Cinebench 15 (2194 points) and 
POV-Ray 3.7 (4549.29 pixels per 
second). 3DMark’s Fire Strike Extreme 
test displays the system’s overall CPU 
and GPU capabilities with a Graphics 
Score of 14232 and a Physics Score 
of 24036. SiSoftware Sandra’s 
Memory Bandwidth test (57.5GBps) 
demonstrates the power of X299’s 
quad-channel support. 
The X299 AORUS Gaming 3 manages 
to adequately support both the enthusiast 
class (Skylake-X) and mainstream (Kaby 
Lake-X) processors and other high-end 
hardware. The $279.99 price tag makes 
it one of the most affordable X299 
motherboards currently available—ideal if 
you’re looking to make a little more room 
in the budget for a Skylake-X CPU.
Just The Start For X299
Compared to previous Intel chipset 
releases, it’s safe to say that motherboard 
manufacturers didn’t have as much time 
to develop complete lineups for X299. 
When Z270 was released, for instance, 
most board partners had several different 
series and options that covered most 
price points. X299 is coming along a bit 
more slowly—likely doubt due at least 
in part to the unprecedented breadth of 
CPUs they must support—and we’ve yet 
to see some of the flagship options with 
premium overclocking features. Of this 
group, performance enthusiasts will likely 
be drawn to the MSI X299 GAMING 
M7 ACK. That’s not to say there aren’t 
compelling reasons to go with the ASRock 
X299 Taichi or the X299 AORUS Gaming 
3, as the mainboards are decent entry-level 
options for the X299 chipset. ■

REALFORCE RGB 
Topre’s Latest Gets A Nice Price For August, September

also pushes the keycap back up as your 
finger lifts off. This sensation, added to 
the rubber dome’s popping action, results 
in a snappy response that’s truly unlike 
anything we’ve experienced with most 
common mechanical switches. 
Above the dome and spring is a plastic 
cylinder with a flat base that keeps the 
keycap straight and firm as it drops and 
rises. The impact of the cone base against 
the keyswitch’s housing results in an audible 
clack. Because this feedback occurs later 
than the feedback we’re used to on MX Blue 
and equivalent switches, the REALFORCE 
RGB initially sounded like each keystroke 
was followed by a rapid echo. This is 
another thing that distinguishes Topre’s 
switches from those on most mechanical 
keyboards. There are Topre keyboards that 
install a rubber O-ring between the base 
of the plastic cylinder and the switch’s 
housing to eliminate or dramatically 
reduce the sound of the key snapping 
back home, but frankly, we’ve grown to 
love the noise. By comparison, this Topre 
keyboard is generally quieter than most 
of the clicky keyboards we’ve tested. Light 
typers who tend to barely lift their fingers 
keyboards in 1983, right around the same 
time that Cherry started. The goal for Topre 
was to take the no-contact chatter-free feel 
of rubber dome-style switches and engineer 
them to be better in every imaginable way. 
The result of their labors is a keyswitch that’s 
a bit of a hybrid between membrane and 
mechanical, but it’s unlike any other hybrid 
switch we’ve used.
A Different Kind Of Dome
The electrostatic capacitive (or “electro-
capacitive,” as Topre refers to it) keyswitch 
starts with the same PCB as any other 
keyboard, but when you press a key to register 
an input with the REALFORCE RGB, the 
rubber cone collapses, allowing the inner peak 
of the dome to come into contact with the 
capacitive sensing circuit on the PCB. 
The sheet of rubber domes looks a lot 
like the rubber dome sheets that you’ll 
find inside just about every inexpensive 
keyboard you’ll come across, but any 
similarity between Topre’s switches 
and the cheap alternatives ends there. 
Installed atop each dome on the Topre 
switch is a conical spring, which not only 
adds a subtle amount of resistance, but 
L
ate last year, Topre launched an RGB-
backlit version of its highly-praised 
REALFORCE keyboard, and since then, 
the response from Topre’s customers has been 
ecstatic. We’re not at all surprised, either. In 
our positively ancient review of the Topre 
Type Heaven, we called it one of the most 
comfortable keyboards we’ve ever used, 
saying “The Type Heaven is like a behavioral 
psychology experiment where pressing a key 
yields a treat, only pressing each key on the 
Type Heaven is the treat.”
With the REALFORCE RGB, that lovely 
satisfying typing experience is back, but now 
it’s sporting a more gamer-friendly fully-
customizable per-key RGB backlight. In an 
effort to spread the word about the joy of 
typing on the REALFORCE RGB to gamers, 
the Japanese company is dropping the price 
to $199.99, though only temporarily. After 
September, the REALFORCE RGB will be 
back at its $232 MSRP. 
A Legacy Of Innovation 
When you think about quality key-
board switches, the first manufacturer that 
pops into your head is probably the German-
based Cherry, but Topre first started making

combo lets you cycle through your custom 
preset modes. The FUNCTION key 
plus the DELETE, END, and PAGE 
DOWN keys let you adjust backlight 
brightness, turn off the backlighting, 
and enable demo mode, respectively. 
APC FTW
We saved the Actuation Point Changer 
feature of the REALFORCE RGB for 
last because it’s such a game changer. 
Topre’s unique switch and key-position-
sensing design enables the keyboard to 
sense 256 distinct points of actuation 
along the 4mm of travel for each key. 
The firmware for this keyboard is 
programmed so that the user can choose 
between three of these actuation points, 
at 1.5mm, 2.2mm, and 3mm. With its 
lightest setting, the REALFORCE RGB 
becomes one of the fastest keyswitches 
you can buy, making it ideal for fast 
double-tapping or lightning-fast response 
in first-person shooters or real-time 
strategy games. The 2.2mm setting 
is fairly standard, and this keyboard’s 
default setting. For those who prefer to 
fully bottom out the keys, there’s the 
3mm setting that effectively eliminates 
accidental keystrokes and requires a heavy 
hand (fingers). There’s even an APC key 
in the upper-right corner that lets you 
swap between the all-key APC settings 
on the fly. If you want to adjust the APC 
on a per-key basis, the intuitive software 
lets you do that. 
Bold, Beautiful & Unique
If you’ve read this far, it’s safe to 
assume you care about the feel, look, 
and performance of your keyboard. 
The Topre REALFORCE RGB excels 
in all of those categories, and it has the 
unique APC function that you simply 
won’t find on a Cherry MX board 
anywhere. If nothing else, keyboard 
lovers owe it to themselves to get their 
hands on a Topre to feel the difference. 
For more information, check out 
www.facebook.com/topre.realforce, and 
remember, the special $199.99 price is 
only available for a limited time. ■
work with Cherry MX keyboards will also 
work on the REALFORCE RGB. 
That being said, the keycaps on this unit 
are of very high quality. They’re made of 
ABS plastic, and have a slight matte finish 
to them. They’re double-shot with an inner 
translucent plastic, and the surface of the 
keys feels perfectly flush. This means that 
the legends won’t ever rub off, the keys are 
easy to clean, and they’ll look good for as 
long as you own the keyboard (assuming you 
occasionally clean them). 
16.8 Million Reasons 
We Love The Backlight
The RGB LEDs on this keyboard 
are actually built into each switch, but the 
clear acrylic housing on the top half of the 
switch lets just the right amount of light 
bleed through. To 
help reflect that light 
between the keys is a 
white backplate that 
surrounds the switches. 
There are two ways 
to adjust the lighting 
on the REALFORCE 
RGB: via the software 
application, or using 
the onboard RGB 
function keys. For 
instance, you can press 
the FUNCTION key 
and the INSERT or 
HOME keys to cycle 
through the lighting 
colors and effects. The 
FUNCTION key 
and PAGE UP key 
off the switches will also experience a less 
pronounced feedback. 
Although these switches have a remarkably 
different feel from standard mechanical 
switches, their 45cn actuation force makes 
them most similar to Cherry MX Reds. 
Mix & Match Your Keycaps
The REALFORCE RGB’s appeal for 
gamers and keyboard enthusiasts at large 
isn’t limited to merely the backlighting. 
The traditional Topre switches tend to only 
support Topre-compatible keycaps, which is 
fine as long you love the keycaps that your 
keyboard ships with. However, the cylindrical 
plunger of this keyboard’s switches have been 
modified to feature the MX-compatible 
cross-shaped stem. This means that any 
keycaps you own or buy that are built to

motherboard can base fan speed off one 
of the five onboard temperature sensors.
On the AM4 platform, AMD 
introduces built-in support for PCIe 
SSDs, as Ryzen processors can feed up to 
four PCIe 3.0 lanes to high-speed storage 
devices. The Mini-ITX form factor doesn’t 
offer a lot of free space, at least on the 
top of the board, for an M.2 slot and the 
corresponding mounting holes. Breaking 
convention, GIGBYATE installs the M.2 
slot on the backside of the PCB. The GA-
AB350N-Gaming WIFI also offers four 
6Gbps SATA ports, which support RAID 
0, 1, and 10 configurations.
Speaking of layout, there’s precious 
open space on this board. And while 
that speaks to GIGABYTE’s engineering 
prowess, the cramped layout does lead to 
some odd header positions. For example, 
the 8-pin CPU power header is jammed 
between the VRM heatsink and the rear 
I/O panel—which makes for some ugly 
power cable routing. But with the SATA 
ports, front panel connectors, and 24-
pin main power on the top of the board, 
there’s just no space for it in the usual 
location. The layout does allow the board 
have room for many extras that can’t fit 
onto the rear I/O panel, so the B350 
chipset is no real detraction.
One thing we really liked about the 
B350 chipset is that AMD still allows for 
overclocking, and GIGABYTE plays this 
up with server-level chokes and digital 
CPU power delivery. The latter is powered 
by International Rectifier controllers that 
use intelligent ICs to evenly distribute 
thermal load. As is common on Mini-ITX 
motherboards, the GA-AB350N-Gaming 
WIFI features only two DIMM slots. 
You can install up to 32GB of memory, 
and GIGABYTE has modules and kits 
operating as fast as 3,200MHz.
Next to the DIMM slots, along the 
side of the PCB, GIGABYTE installs a 
few RGB LEDs that create a backlight 
effect. If your small form factor build 
includes RGB LED light strips, you’ll also 
like that the GA-AB350N-Gaming WIFI 
has two RGB pin headers to help you 
sync up system illumination. Speaking of 
headers, the two fan headers on the GA-
AB350N-Gaming WIFI feature a hybrid 
design with support for either a PWM or 
Voltage mode. In the PWM mode, the 
W
hen the AM4 platform was first 
released, AMD announced two 
chipsets, X300 and A300, designed 
specifically for small form factors. SFF 
builders have to be a bit disappointed 
that months later there are still no X300 
or A300 options available. Fortunately, 
a few enterprising motherboard makers 
have managed to fit the X370 and B350 
chipsets onto microATX and Mini-ITX 
form factors. GIGABYTE shrinks the 
B350 chipset down to the Mini-ITX form 
factor with the GA-AB350N-Gaming 
WIFI and still found some room for 
power user improvements.
Despite not being designed for 
use on small form factor systems, the 
B350 is a fine choice for a Mini-ITX 
mainboard. One of the important 
caveats with B350, when compared to 
the X370 chipset, is that B350 doesn’t 
support SLI and has limited capabilities 
for CrossFire. But that’s not a problem 
on Mini-ITX because there’s only room 
for one expansion slot. B350 also offers 
fewer general purpose lanes and less 
connectivity for SATA devices than X370. 
Again, Mini-ITX boards typically don’t

Creative Labs Sound BlasterX AE-5
In addition to some LED accents (including 
the logo on the AE-5’s horizontal edge) on 
the card itself, Creative included an RGB 
controller and a 4-pin RGB header. To 
make certain that header has something to 
do, Creative gives you one 30cm LED strip 
(that’s 10 LEDs, for anyone keeping score 
at home) with the AE-5; we appreciated the 
included extension cable, too, as it made 
wire management a little easier. Fire up 
Creative’s Sound Blaster Connect software 
and punch in a custom color. One of those 
16.8 million possible colors will satisfy you. 
The Sound Blaster Connect’s LED controls 
are actually well executed; we expected 
bolted-on functionality, but it’s clear to 
us after using the software controls that 
Creative took the AE-5’s LED capabilities 
seriously. Additionally, if your motherboard 
doesn’t belong to the LED Generation, the 
AE-5 is a handy way add such functionality.
Looks aside, the AE-5 happens to be a 
dynamite sound card. It’s equipped with a 
122dB 32-bit/384kHz ESS Sabre DAC, but 
you will need Windows 10 to take advantage 
F
or years, sound card manufacturers have 
really only had to be concerned with one 
of the five senses. And for years, they’ve done 
a pretty good job, presenting richer, fuller 
sounds in our games, music, movies, and 
everything else that we need to hear. As crazy 
at it might seem, though, sound cards may 
need to appeal to more senses in order to stay 
relevant. Take a look at Creative Labs’ Sound 
BlasterX AE-5 if you require proof.
No really, take a look. The AE-5’s Aurora 
Reactive Lighting System brings LED 
lighting to the Sound Blaster family. Big 
picture, there’s some strategic sense to the 
move. Obviously, LED-lit components have 
exploded in popularity to the point that 
not including them on hardware may be a 
deficiency for some enthusiasts. Top-shelf 
motherboards are already packed with them, 
and they also regularly feature high-end 
integrated sound chips. The Aurora system is 
one of Creative’s attempts to woo power users 
into its camp.
The “System” in “Aurora Reactive 
Lighting System” is more than puffery, too. 
of the full fidelity. Knowing that the bulk of 
its customers will be gamers who regularly 
have a pair of cans strapped to their head, 
Creative deploys its Xamp. Rather than a 
single amplifier IC driving both left and right 
channels, Xamp uses two. Its 1Ω impedance 
is ideal for headphones up to 600Ω.
We installed the AE-5 and took it for a spin 
in Left 4 Dead 2. We were surprised to hear 
the range of sound it was able to coax out of a 
$50 HyperX headset. Shotgun blasts resonated 
with deep bass, and pistol shots sounded crisp. 
When the action heated up, we thought the 
AE-5 distinguished itself by never letting the 
uproar become a muddled mess. Similarly, the 
sound card did a fine job presenting Metallica’s 
“The Call of Ktulu” collaboration with the San 
Francisco Symphony.
Creative’s Sound BlasterX AE-5 is sweet, 
and it’s priced accordingly. However, if 
you’re an audiophile also in search of an 
LED command center, this is the sound 
card you need. ■

Intel Core i7-7740X
HD Graphics 630), but it runs 
at a 112-watt TDP instead of the 
91-watts of the 7700K. 
The major thing that differ-
entiates this processor from the 
7700K is that it requires an X299 
motherboard, any of which will 
cost a fair amount more than 
comparable Z270 motherboards 
due to the required support for 
quad-channel memory and up to 
44 PCIe lanes that this processor 
can’t tap into. The big takeaway 
is this; the Intel Core i7-7700K 
is the star of the show on the 
Z270 platform, but on the X299 
platform, the Intel Core i7-7740K 
comes off looking like a dud. 
When it comes to overclocking, 
this processor again failed to 
impress. No matter how much 
we tweaked the voltage, and tried 
to keep temps in check with a 
240mm closed-loop liquid cooler, 
this processor hit a hard ceiling at 
5GHz, which is the same overclock 
we managed with the 7700K. 
Kaby Lake-X processors are 
strange products created to appeal 
to a rare (or nonexistent) user type. 
Our advice; stick a Skylake-X in 
your X299 motherboard, go with 
Z270 and a vanilla Kaby Lake, or 
buy AMD. ■

I
n last month’s review of the Intel Core i9-
7900X, there were two caveats keeping us 
from giving the platform an unmitigated 
recommendation. The first is the fact that 
the platform’s most powerful processors 
won’t launch until October. The second 
is that Intel decided to open the HEDT 
platform to a subset of aspiring enthusiasts 
who might buy this processor and an X299 
motherboard in the hopes that they’ll be 
able to upgrade to a Skylake-X processor 
and quad-channel memory at some point 
in the future. It’s a nice idea, but realistically 
the number of builders for whom this 
scenario will be feasible is pretty small. 
Some people might even say they don’t exist. 
But before we start into the leprechauns 
and unicorns portion of this review let’s 
take a closer look at the Intel Core i7-
7740X and what it brings to the table. This 
is just a Kaby Lake Intel Core i7-7700K 
with the graphics engine disabled and the 
core clocked up 100MHz. It’s a quad-core 
processor with Hyper-Threading enabled 
for managing up to eight concurrent 
threads at a time. It has a 4.3GHz core 
clock, and a Turbo Boost 2.0 frequency 
of up to 4.5GHz, which is the same TB2 
frequency as on the 7700K. There’s 8MB 
of Intel Smart Cache, an 8GTps DMI 3.0 
bus, a dual-channel memory controller 
with a slight bump to support up to 
DDR4-2666, and 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes. It 
has a 14nm process-based die, it supports 
everything Kaby Lake supported last year

ENERMAX Ostrog Lite
The Ostrog Lite has an acrylic side-panel 
window on the left panel and a solid steel 
panel on its right side; the top panel has 
ventilated mounting points for a pair of 
120mm fans and a dust filter over the mesh 
that is held lightly in place by magnets. The 
motherboard tray inside is well-equipped 
with cable management slots and tie-down 
anchors, and supports ATX, Mini-ITX, and 
MicroATX motherboards, as well as up to 
two 2.5-inch drives (on the inside facing 
left). The case includes two bays for 5.25-
inch drives up top, but there’s no bulky cage 
up there, and you can take the support that 
is there out by removing a couple screws; 
this leaves the interior open and tidy, as the 
3.5-inch drive bays are located behind the 
included power supply shroud.
One point of interest that we’ve 
not seen before: ENERMAX puts an 
80mm/90mm fan mounting spot just 
beneath the front of the shroud along 
with the necessary ventilation. You can 
only install a fan there if you remove the 
top 3.5-inch drive tray in the bay below,

NERMAX’s Ostrog line of mid-
tower PC cases includes several main 
variants, including the Ostrog, the Ostrog 
GT, and the Ostrog ADV; each comes 
in at least two color combinations (the 
Ostrog ADV comes in black and red, 
black and green, or black and blue). The 
Ostrog GT is the most ostentatious of 
the bunch, with highly detailed sculpting 
on its front panel and front-end bezel, 
while the original Ostrog has the simplest 
design—or did, until the arrival of the 
newest Ostrog, the Ostrog Lite.
Ostrog Lite most closely resembles the 
Ostrog ADV in terms of its proportions 
and general design, but replaces the mesh 
and LED fans that dominate the bottom 
half or so of the ADV’s front panel with a 
smooth, understated front panel with what 
ENERMAX calls a “hairline surface.” It most 
closely resembles brushed aluminum, and 
it’s a pretty good look for this case, which 
is pretty restrained stylistically all the way 
around, the only exception being the pre-
installed 120mm red LED fan in the rear.
but it should help to provide a little extra 
airflow beneath the shroud. Alternatively, 
it would provide a pretty nice mounting 
spot for a reservoir if you decide to go 
custom with your cooling.
While we’re on the topic of airflow, 
ventilation up front is limited to a little 
over 3/4ths of an inch of mesh at the 
bottom of the front panel, as the rest of the 
panel is closed tight despite the appearance 
of a gap around a panel inset. You can 
mount two fans up front, though, so 
they’ll be pulling as much air as possible 
through that bottom gap; it might make 
sense to use your (optional) top-mounted 
fans to intake, as well, depending on what 
else you’re doing inside.
ENERMAX’s Ostrog Lite doesn’t do 
anything too fancy, but it’s a nice-looking 
case with a PSU shroud and a fair degree 
of flexibility inside for drives and cooling. 
And with an MSRP of just $49.99, the 
price is right, too. ■

sides, it extends beyond the front of 
the frame by about three-quarters of an 
inch and is open at the top and bottom, 
providing lots of ventilation for front-
panel fans, should you decide to install 
one or two. The front panel is also a good 
spot for a 240mm radiator if that’s how 
you roll. Otherwise, ventilation is pretty 
standard, including a single-fan vent set 
into the top panel (with a magnetically 
secured dust filter) and the usual mesh in 
the bottom and rear panels.
Elsewhere, the Orbit-Z1 is configured 
for the kinds of clean interiors that are 
popular these days, with its 3.5-inch drive 
bays hidden behind the power supply 
shroud toward the front of the chassis, a 
couple vertical SSD mounting spots on 
the mobo tray, and no 5.25-inch drive 
I
f you look over Rosewill’s case lineup, 
you’ll see lots of cases that come with 
pre-installed LED fans, but until the 
company launched its new Orbit-Z1, 
there were none with LEDs built 
into the chassis itself. The Orbit-Z1 
remedies this issue nicely. It ships with 
two pre-installed seven-color 120mm 
LED fans (rear and top installation), 
has a series of RGB LEDs that run 
along the power supply shroud below 
the window line of the left-side panel, 
and has a front panel with an RGB 
LED strip running all the way around 
its edges and another that runs along it 
from top to bottom.
All of these LEDs are connected to 
a tiny light control board mounted 
behind the motherboard tray, and thus 
are all synced and slaved to the LED 
button at the front of the top panel. 
When you power up the case, all the 
lights flash quickly through a looped 
series of seven bright colors; each press 
of the LED button switches the lights 
bays. (There are vestigial spots at the 
front of the frame and on the right side 
for 5.25-inch bays, for some reason, 
but there’s no way for an optical drive 
tray to open to the front.) Graphics 
cards up to nearly 15 inches long are 
supported, as are CPU coolers a little 
over 6 inches tall. The power supply 
shroud includes a couple cable routing 
holes, some extra ventilation, and two 
120mm fan mounts.
The Rosewill Orbit-Z1 is a pretty 
straightforward case in terms of its 
dimensions and features, except of 
course for its big-time LED integration, 
which is especially interesting for a 
case at this price. (MSRP is $99.99, 
but Rosewill tells us it will be available 
online for $69.99.) If you’re looking 
for a case that complements the lights 
on your components but want to avoid 
breaking the bank, this might be the 
one for you. ■

ENERMAX EAG001 Air Guide
also includes eight metal screws that you 
can install into the fan mounts. In our 
experience, the magnetic hold is strong 
enough that you can rotate the grill 
without any wiggle to the Air Guide.
To match the color scheme of your 
build, ENERMAX offers the Air Guide 
in a few different color options. There are 
all-white and all-black versions, as well as 
red and black or green and black options. 
With the color combos, the grill is red or 
green, while the frame is black on both 
models.
The Air Guide can be used with any 
120mm fan, but there are some places 
where two guides would be best used, 
C
ase manufacturers have made strides 
in recent years to improve airflow with 
modular bays and other customizable 
internals. But despite the greater 
flexibility, fan placement isn’t always ideal, 
especially if your system includes long 
radiators, big reservoirs, and 
hulking graphics cards that 
may block airflow and create 
hot spots. ENERMAX’s new 
EAG001 Air Guide is a simple 
way to tweak airflow and more 
effectively direct air to, or 
around, the hardware in your 
system. The 120mm plastic 
frame boasts angled vents and 
a rotatable grill, so you can 
route cool air where it needs to go.
ENERMAX includes two Air Guides 
in each package. And installing both, 
in most cases, should take less than a 
minute. ENERMAX provides magnetic 
mounting pins to quickly attach the 
Air Guide to a 120mm fan’s existing 
mounting screws. For situations where 
the fan is mounted from behind, such 
as some rear exhaust fans, ENERMAX 
in our opinion. A case’s front panel 
intake fans, for example, are often 
positioned near the bottom of the case 
and don’t often push air directly over the 
motherboard. You could position one 
of the guides to direct cool air onto a 
GPU, while the second could 
route air to your system 
memory and motherboard. 
Another excellent use is a 
system where an air cooler 
isn’t lined up with the case’s 
rear exhaust and you need to 
direct hot air from the CPU 
cooler out the PC.
E N E R M A X  
p r i c e s 
the EAG001 Air Guide 
at $19.99, which might be a bit pricy 
considering the kit’s basic functionality. 
That being said, if your system has a few 
hot zones, the two Air Guides are much 
cheaper solution than replacing your case 
or completely revamping your cooling. ■

AMD Ryzen 3 1300X
copper core of the 95-watt-capable Wraith 
Spire CPU cooler, overclockers should 
keep a close eye on their temperatures 
when overclocking with it, or better yet, 
upgrade to an aftermarket cooler. When 
overclocking the Ryzen 3 1300X, using 
a custom-built liquid cooling loop, we 
managed to achieve a 3.9GHz core clock 
with the core voltage to 1.25V, giving us a 
decent bump in the benchmark scores. 
The Ryzen 3 1300X includes an onboard 
dual-channel DDR4 memory controller 
supporting 2,666MHz speeds, but given 
the right motherboard and memory 
combination, you should be able to achieve 
3,200MHz or better. We were short on 
time, so we weren’t able to get our MSI 
X370 XPOWER GAMING TITANIUM 
to run either of the DDR4 kits we tried 
above 2,133MHz. Even so, this processor 
posted scores that in many cases, were very 
close to that of the Ryzen 5 1400, which 
just goes to show you that SMT still falls 
flat with some lightly-threaded workloads. 
We can’t recommend this processor, 
or the even more hobbled Ryzen 3 1200, 
to anyone who does a significant amount 
of multitasking, streaming, encoding, or 
other productivity work. When it comes 
to building a budget gaming rig, however, 
this is probably one of the most affordable 
options available that lets you devote 
the lion’s share of your cash to a discrete 
graphics card. ■

he Ryzen 3 1300X, and its lower-
clocked sibling the Ryzen 3 1200, are 
the first Summit Ridge-based processors 
in the Ryzen family to have SMT 
(simultaneous multithreading) disabled. 
Like the bottom of the Ryzen 5 stack, 
these two processors feature a 2+2 CCX 
(Compute Complex) configuration, 
which means that there are still two quad-
core CCX blocks on the die, but half of 
the cores of each CCX module have been 
disabled, leaving us with four functional 
cores on an Infinity Fabric interface. 
Just like every other Ryzen processor 
we’ve covered, this 192mm2 die 
consisting of 4.8 billion transistors is 
manufactured on Global Foundry’s 
14nm FinFET process. This processor 
has 512KB per core L2 cache and 8MB 
of shared L3 cache. The core clocks are 
rather interesting on the Ryzen 3 1300X. 
The base clock is 3.5GHz, but the chip 
supports an all-core Precision Boost 
clock up to 3.6GHz. Two cores can go 
100MHz faster when there’s enough 
thermal capacity, and AMD’s Extended 
Frequency Range (XFR) Technology will 
give this processor an extra 200MHz to 
run with when possible. In addition to the 
impressive XFR number, this processor is 
unlocked for fast and easy overclocking. 
The Ryzen 3 1300X is a 65-watt TDP 
processor that comes with the same 
Wraith Stealth CPU cooler as the entry-
level Ryzen 5 processor. The Wraith 
Stealth is a low-profile cooler made of 
aluminum, and because it lacks the

Aerocool P7-F12 Pro 
Sync Up Your Rig’s RGB Lighting
on the PC and download Aerocool’s 
P7-S1 software utility. When selecting 
a color, Aerocool lets you enter a hex 
color code or numerical RGB color 
spaces. For instance, those wanting 
a true blue color could enter Hex 
number 0073cf or 0/115/207 into the 
respective R/G/B fields. There’s also 
a color wheel where you can drag the 
mouse over the hue you prefer. We 
prefer the numerical data entry over 
the color wheel, as it simplifies the 
process of perfectly matching up RGB 
colors with other components. The 
P7-S1 utility also displays the current 
fan speed of connected fans.
Let There Be Light
The P7-H1 hub should work with 
virtually any RGB device (including, 
say, RGB LED light strips) equipped 
with a 4-pin RGB connector, as it 
supports up to 24 watts of LED 
output. Best of all, the entire P7-F12 
Pro kit only costs $59.99, so it’s an 
affordable way to add to—and take 
control of—your system’s lighting. ■
can purchase additional P7-H1 hubs. 
(Up to eight P7-H1 hubs can connect 
to a single motherboard.) The P7-H1 
also serves as a fan hub for up to five 
fans and has a 4-pin PWM connector 
to extend the PWM signal from the 
motherboard. 
The included P7-F12 RGB fans 
don’t necessarily need to connect to 
the P7-H1 hub to synchronize RGB 
color. You could, for instance, connect 
the fans directly to a motherboard’s 
4-pin RGB header to free up to hub’s 
two RGB headers for other devices. 
Smartly, Aerocool lets you daisy 
chain the P7-F12 fans (each fan 
boasts a male and female RGB 4-pin 
connector), so the three fans only 
require a single RGB header.
Take Control
Once the hub, fans, and other RGB

State-Of-The-Art
Standards
Intel Turbo Boost Technology
Both Intel and AMD (and IBM before 
them) saw the writing on that wall and 
realized that winning the clock speed race 
was a losing proposition, resulting in higher 
and higher power requirements without 
delivering enough of a performance 
advantage to justify the cost. The future of 
microprocessors would be multi-core. 
In a perfect world, software running on 
a multi-core processor would split its tasks 
into as many individual threads as there 
are cores on the processor, and as a result, 
the processor would execute the series 
The Multi-core Conundrum
Before the dawn of parallel computing, 
back when the only processors available 
were single-core, think 2005 and earlier, all 
software looked effectively the same to the 
processor, as a series of complex or simple 
program instructions. There was no multi-
threading, just a series of tasks getting in 
line one after another, and processors got 
faster generation-on-generation only by 
arranging the tasks more intelligently, or 
through sheer brute force, enabled through 
higher and higher clock speeds. 
T
urbo Boost Technology is the automatic 
and effortless clock speed-ramping 
tech inside select Intel processors from 
every architecture between Nehalem and 
the recently launched Skylake-X and Kaby 
Lake-X processors. We all know what Turbo 
Boost does, and we all know why we want it 
enabled on our enthusiast processors (faster 
= better), but because it has been around 
for so long, we rarely take the time to delve 
deeper and examine how Turbo Boost 
works and why it’s so effective when enabled 
on modern-day processors from Intel. 
Intel’s Nehalem processors were the first to sport Turbo Boost Technology.
CPU  /  August2017 33

are about as effective as slipping wheels 
on a car; they’ll get you nowhere fast. 
With Turbo Boost enabled, the processor’s 
performance will slip a little less often.
The First Turbos
The first processor to come with 
Turbo Boost Technology was an LGA 
1366-socketed Bloomfield enthusiast 
desktop processor that launched in 
November 2008: the $999 Intel Core i7-
965 Extreme. The 2.93GHz Intel Core 
i7-940 and 2.66GHz Core i7-920 also 
launched at the same time, but still targeted 
the high-end desktop market. The more 
budget-friendly Lynnfield Core i7 and Core 
i5 processors that launched in September 
2009 brought Turbo Boost Technology to 
the masses, starting at a mere $196 for the 
dual-core 2.66GHz Intel Core i5-750. 
According to Intel’s Turbo Boost 
Technology whitepaper, dated to 
coincide with the launch of the flagship 
Nehalem processor, the technology 
can boost performance with any 
number of cores or logical processors 
enabled and active, resulting in better 
multi-threaded and single-threaded 
workload performance. Even in its first 
iteration, Intel designed the feature to 
be OS agnostic. As long as the OS in 
question supports ACPI (Advanced 
Configuration and Power Interface), the 
feature will work automatically and it’ll 
be transparent to the end user. ACPI is an 
open standard that lets the OS perform 
power management functions for various 
hardware components, including putting 
them to sleep and monitoring each 
device’s moment-to-moment status. The 
first ACPI-compliant OS was Windows 
98, but it was hampered by buggy early-
ACPI hardware. ACPI improved in 
successive versions, as other OSes joined 
the party, including FreeBSD, NetBSD, 
OpenBSD, OpenVMS, and Solaris to 
name several. Linux kernel version 2.6.0 
and onward also support ACPI by default. 
According to Intel, the highest increase 
a processor will get when Turbo Boost 
engages is dependent upon the number 
of active cores and can vary from model 
number to model number. Furthermore, 
multi-core processors work extremely well 
with highly parallelized software, but fall 
rather flat when running single or lightly-
threaded workloads. In the early days 
of multi-core processors, software was 
generally not parallel in nature.
The Turbo Boost Band-Aid
In 2008, Intel’s engineers were faced 
with a growing stack of processors that 
used two and four cores, but lightly-
threaded software wasn’t exactly becoming 
multi-threaded overnight. This meant that 
most of the software users were running 
on these early multi-cores were punishing 
just one of the processor’s cores a majority 
of the time while leaving the rest idle. 
Turbo Boost Technology was born 
as a way to reappropriate this excess of 
available processing power, enabling the 
core that’s working hardest to increase its 
clock speed dynamically, as needed. 
To use a car analogy straight out of a 
Subaru ad from the mid-‘90s, Turbo Boost 
is like the differential in an all-wheel-drive 
car, transferring power from the wheels 
that slip to the wheels that grip. In the 
case of multi-core processors, idle cores 
of program instructions in parallel until 
complete. In this fantasy realm, a task that 
used to take a single-core processor an hour 
to complete would complete in 30 minutes 
on a dual-core processor, or 15 minutes on 
a quad-core processor. We all know that 
we don’t live in a perfect world, however, 
and the expected performance doesn’t scale 
linearly with the core count, doubling in 
a dual-core processor, or quadrupling in a 
quad-core processor. 
This diminishing return is described 
by Amdahl’s law. Given a fixed workload, 
this law states that the expected 
theoretical speedup in latency of a multi-
core processor is limited by the time it 
takes to execute any non-parallel tasks. 
For instance, let’s say we’re working on a 
4K video that takes eight hours to encode 
on a single core processor. When running 
that encoding task on a multi-core 
processor, there is a part of the process 
that cannot be parallelized, which takes 
one hour, meaning that the remaining 
threads, regardless of how many cores are 
available to execute it, cannot complete 
the whole task faster than the time it takes 
to execute that unthreaded task. In short, 
Turbo Boost can be disabled from the BIOS, which is sometimes necessary for overclocking.
34 August2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

Transform) algorithm calculations, which 
fill the L2 cache without spilling into system 
memory, are known to have particularly 
strong impact on temperature. Another 
Turbo Boosted workload, Prime95’s In-
place Large FFTs, ropes in system memory, 
which results in higher power consumption 
from the CPU. This is yet another scenario 
where Turbo Boost disengages on demand, 
even if the temperatures are still well within 
acceptable ranges. 
As long as power delivery limits are 
maintained, a Turbo Boost-capable 
processor will be able to enjoy the increase 
in clock speed until one or more of the 
following occur: the estimated current 
consumption of the processor increases 
beyond preset limits, the estimated power 
consumption of the processor increases 
beyond preset limits, or the temperature 
of the processor hits the aforementioned 
redundant with even a modest increase in 
operating frequency. 
Like Clockwork
Running at a higher core frequency 
sounds good on paper, but any mildly 
experienced overclocker knows that not 
every workload is the same and that there 
are a variety of ways to stress a processor. It 
turns out that there are plenty of reasons 
that Turbo Boost will disengage itself to 
prevent the processor from consuming too 
much power or generating too much heat. If 
everything else is equal but a Turbo Boosted 
workload begins to push the temperature 
near the TJMax (Thermal Junction Max, 
the highest operating temperature the 
cores can run at before throttling occurs), 
Turbo Boost automatically drops the 
frequency back to the base clock. For 
instance, Prime95’s small FFT (Fast Fourier 
the amount of time the processor remains 
boosted depends on the operating 
environment and the tasks at hand. For 
this to work properly, the processor needs 
to continually measure temperature, 
current draw, and power consumption 
in order to make the headroom estimates 
that allow Turbo Boost to maintain clock 
speeds that are higher than the base clock. 
Bridging the gap between the ACPI-
compliant OS and Intel’s new processors 
is the Turbo Boost controller, which is 
capable of checking in up to 200 times 
per second to determine if there’s a need 
for Turbo Boost to shift into high gear.
Turbo Boost was also designed to 
be flexible enough that users with the 
appropriate switches in the BIOS could 
turn it off if need be. Overclocking those 
early chips often involved disabling 
Turbo Boost, as it was effectively made 
The fewer active cores there are, the higher the Turbo Boost frequency multiplier will be. 
CPU  /  August2017 35

supported levels of the Sleep state, including 
Deep Sleep and Deeper Sleep, but for the 
purposes of Turbo Boost, anything greater 
than C3 or C6 is considered inactive. 
Calculating The Boost
Because Turbo Boost has been around for 
so long, with three updates since its initial 
launch and the latest Skylake-X and Kaby 
Lake-X processors, it doesn’t always work 
the same. The Nehalem and Westmere 
architecture-based processors use 133MHz 
Turbo Boost steps (the clock speed increment 
at which the cores increase). Sandy Bridge, 
Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Broadwell, Skylake, and 
Kaby Lake processors all use nice, round 
100MHz Turbo Boost steps. 
Each Turbo Boost-enabled processor 
comes with a multi-digit Max Intel Turbo 
Boost Technology “bin upside” number 
that looks something like this: 3/3/3/3/5/5. 
That’s the bin upside number for the 
a numeric C state, shorthand for CPU 
power state, depending on what it’s 
doing at the moment. These C states are 
hardwired into the processor, and some 
processors have more C states than 
others. For instance, Intel’s Haswell-based 
processors also include package states, for 
up to a total of 10 possible C state settings. 
According to Intel, an active core is 
one with a C0 or C1 state, which refers to 
cores that are either currently operating to 
execute threads or in a halt state but ready 
to receive threads without delay, respectively. 
The C2 or “Stop Clock” state is optionally 
supported on processors, but it refers to 
a state where the core maintains visibility 
to the software but will only be available 
to field threads after a short delay. C3 is 
a widely supported C state that’s referred 
to as the “Sleep” state. The caches of a 
processor core in a C3 state are no longer 
coherent. There are multiple optionally 
TJMax. As a side note, you can eliminate 
(or dramatically reduce) the times that 
temperature becomes the reason Turbo 
Boost backs off by installing a quality 
CPU cooler with significantly more 
thermal capacity than your processor 
typically calls for. A fourth reason Turbo 
Boost gets shut off is simply when all 
cores of the processor go idle. While 
Turbo Boost is a bit like overclocking, 
the big takeaway is that it only engages 
and continues to function as long as the 
processor remains safely within its design 
specifications.
The C-State Connection
We mentioned previously that the 
number of active cores has an effect on 
whether Turbo Boost engages, but 
we didn’t actually define what qualifies 
as “active.” The operating system assigns 
each core of a multi-core processor with 
Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 lets the best-performing core run considerably faster than all the rest.
36 August2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

The earliest iterations of the driver needed 
to be manually downloaded from Intel and 
installed in order to enable the feature, but as 
of the launch of the new X-Series processors, 
the Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 
driver comes to your system via Windows 
Update. One of the coolest features of 
the latest revision is the Intel TBMT 3.0 
Control Panel application, which lets users 
manually direct certain applications to run 
on the fastest core, effectively giving that app 
a higher priority than all others. 
To The Max
It’s not common for us to focus on a 
proprietary technology in the pages of State-
Of-The-Art Standards, and as a result, this 
article lacks the usual nitty gritty details that 
we’re typically privy to with open industry-
wide standards. On the other hand, Turbo 
Boost definitely qualifies as a technology 
that yields tangible benefits for a large 
group of enthusiasts, which makes it a good 
topic nonetheless. Next month, we plan 
to take a closer look at AMD’s automatic 
and algorithmic clock-speed-enhancing 
technology as it has evolved from its earliest 
form to its current state in Ryzen and 
Threadripper processors. ■
Turbo Boost Revisions
Since 2008, Intel has made a couple 
minor changes to Turbo Boost. In 
2011, Intel launched its Turbo Boost 
Technology v2.0, available on Core 
i5 and Core i7 Sandy Bridge and later 
desktop processors. This update to the 
specification simply accounted for the 
new architecture consisting of integrated 
on-die processor and graphics. 
Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 
3.0 is featured on the Intel Core i7-
6950X Processor Extreme Edition, Intel 
Core i7-6800K, i7-6850K, i7-6900K, 
i9-7900X, i7-7820X processors, and 
the Intel Xeon Processor E5 1600 v4 
family of processors. We’re going to go 
out on a limb here and predict that the 
remaining HCC Skylake-X processors 
due to launch throughout the rest of the 
year will also support this technology. 
The big difference here is that Intel 
has enabled the system to determine 
the favored, or best core, capable of 
maintaining the highest operating 
frequency with the lowest leakage at 
the highest reliability. Turbo Boost Max 
3.0 needs support in the BIOS, in the 
processor, and in the OS via a driver. 
Haswell-E Intel Core i7-5960X, which 
refer to the various Turbo Boost multipliers 
as they correspond to active cores. This is 
an eight-core processor, and that first digit 
refers to the Turbo Boost multiplier when 
six-to-eight cores are active, times Haswell’s 
100MHz steps, which equals a max Turbo 
Boost frequency increase, assuming there’s 
enough headroom, of 300MHz. The second 
number refers to the multiplier for five 
active cores, followed the by the multiplier 
for four and three active cores. As you can 
see, Turbo Boost on this processor doesn’t go 
above 300MHz until just one or two cores 
are active, and then it bumps the frequency 
up by a multiplier of five, for 500MHz. 
Mobile processors that support Turbo 
Boost get a little more room to run. For 
instance, the Sandy Bridge-based Intel Core 
i7-2920XM has a 7/7/9/10 bin upside. Its 
rather low base frequency of 2.5GHz will 
boost to 3.2GHz when three or four cores 
are active (2.5GHz + 700MHz), 3.4GHz 
when just two cores are active (2.5GHz 
+ 900MHz), and up to 3.5GHz when 
just one core is active (1GHz). Although 
these numbers are impressive, mobile 
processors have much tighter thermal and 
power limitations, so it’s likely that Turbo 
Boost engages less often than on 
the desktop variants. Incidentally, 
if you’re wondering why we just 
covered the bin upside of Haswell 
and earlier processors, it’s because 
Intel stopped divulging these stats for 
its more recent architectures. 
Before Turbo Boost, 
There Was …
Intel Dynamic Acceleration, 
admittedly a rather un-catchy 
name, was a technology that Intel 
introduced on its Core 2-based 
Centrino platform. The nuts and 
bolts of how IDA turned on was 
rather simplified compared to how 
Turbo Boost would later function. 
Basically, whenever the OS told the 
processor to send one of the cores 
to a C3 sleep state, the frequency of 
the remaining active cores increased 
while still keeping the processor 
within its design specification. 
The Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 Control Panel lets you manually assign an application to the fastest core.

Mastercase 5 Racing
[outside diameter] stainless steel tubing, inspired by the 
fuel and brake lines of a race car,” Owen says. “I used 316 
marine-grade stainless, so corrosion isn’t an issue. Working 
with stainless steel requires a mandrel bender, and it takes a 
great deal of practice to get perfect bends.”
The items at the top of the front panel are also from 
fitting sources: “The gauge is a VDO 12-volt gauge from 
an old Volkswagen to indicate power,” Owen tells us. “And 
the main power switch is a momentary toggle switch with 
red safety cover that was used for the ignition switch in the 
Porsche 917.”
Mnpctech Parts
Other points of interest include the front grille, which 
Owen laser-cut from one-eighth-inch cast acrylic, the 
smoked acrylic “moon roof ” window on the top panel, 
the clear acrylic side-panel window that is held in place by 
embedded magnets, and the 120mm ring/fan grille on top 
that resembles a race car’s fuel fill port. The latter three items 
are all Mnpctech products, as are the machined-aluminum 
cable combs that help keep the thick paracord PC cables 
(inspired by sparkplug wires) neat and tidy.
Components & Cooling
Under the hood, Mastercase 5 Racing has a laundry list 
of parts that provide serious performance despite not being 
quite as cutting-edge as they once were. The rig is powered 
B
ill “Mnpctech” Owen has created a lot of great mods 
over the last 16 years, but he just recently finished 
work on a mod idea that he’s always wanted to build, 
and the result was this month’s Mad Reader Mod. Mastercase 
5 Racing was inspired by the legendary Porsche 917 driven 
by Steve McQueen in a movie from 1971. “I’ve always 
wanted to create a build inspired by ‘Le Mans,’” Owen says. 
“You also don’t often see pastel colors used on custom PC 
builds, but this combination really works nicely.”
Owen says he will primarily use this rig for editing video 
and photos, and that he got deals on all of the hardware in 
the system by finding parts on eBay or buying them from 
friends who were upgrading their systems. “A lot of people 
get caught up in chasing the bleeding edge of tech, but if 
you’re patient and determined, you can build a really cool 
custom rig on a budget,” Owen says.
Passion Project
Owen may have saved some money on components, but 
he went all-out in getting the stuff he needed to bring his 
dream project to life. “I tracked down the factory paint 
codes for the 1970 Porsche 917,” Owen says. “The EK XTX 
360mm radiator was painted in Gulf Racing Orange; the 
orange stripe is mirrored onto the chassis. The circle number 
five represents ‘Mastercase 5.’”
But as you have probably noticed, the automotive theme 
didn’t end with the paint job. “I chose one-half-inch OD

EVGA GeForce GTX 980 Ti graphics cards in SLI, and a 
Corsair 800-watt PSU. The case, of course, is Cooler Master’s 
MasterCase Maker 5.
Owen says all of the fans in the build are Scythe Gentle 
Typhoon AP-15 units. “Unfortunately, these cooling fans are 
no longer being made, but there are still some available from 
online retailers,” he says. “They have good static pressure, 
and under-volt nicely. Plus they are easy to dismantle for 
custom painting.”
Other cooling gear in the build includes a Bitspower 
Summit 1150 CPU block, EK motherboard blocks, an EK 
XTX 360mm radiator, two Koolance 980 Ti waterblocks and 
two Koolance backplates, Mnpctech Overkill stainless-steel 
hardline compression fittings, a Koolance three-way splitter 
fitting with drain port, and a Koolance drain valve.
More To Come
As you would expect, Owen isn’t taking much time off 
now that Mastercase 5 Racing is complete. “I’m currently in 
the planning stages with Jeremy “E.E.L. Ambiense” Birch 
to create a custom PC that will look like it came from the 
Nostromo spaceship in the first ‘Alien’ movie,” Owen says.

KCGameOn 75
15 Hours Of Awesome
Back in 2005, some co-workers in the Kansas City area started gaming together on weekends. Now, 12 years have passed, and 15-person informal 
LANs have given way to organized events that bring in hundreds of BYOC attendees and hundreds more spectators and tabletop gamers. These 
events take place six times each year, and are all part of the KCGameOn series of LANs. 
KCGameOn 75 took place on Saturday, June 10, from noon to 3 a.m. the next morning in North Kansas City, and CPU was there. Attendance for the 
event totaled 412, and in addition to the BYOC LAN (complete with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, Overwatch, and Rocket 
League tournaments, of course), attendees and spectators alike spent time playing console games and tabletop games. KCGameOn events also 
include Hearthstone tourneys, and console fighting game tournaments, so there’s something for everyone. 
The event provides dinner, pop, and snacks as part of the entry fee ($20 for BYOC, $15 for console and tabletop, or $25 for all), and PC rentals are 
available if you’d rather not haul your own rig to the LAN. (Rental rigs include Core i5-4570 processors and EVGA GeForce GTX 960 graphics cards; 
you can get more info at the KCGameOn site’s News page.)
If you live in or near the KC metro and would like to find out more, you can check them out on Twitter (@KCGameOn) or Facebook (www.facebook.com/

In addition to giving away some cool prizes, we held a mod contest at the event, and our winner was Jonathan “Warboy” Imler. 
His rig (he calls it Ragnarok) is housed in a Phanteks Enthoo EVOLV and is tricked out with a custom hardline cooling loop and 
red LEDs all around.
For winning the mod contest, Imler received a GIGABYTE AORUS 
AX370-Gaming K7 AM4 motherboard.
While we were at KCGameOn 75, we also got

We all know that when it comes to cooling your CPU or GPU, water is the superior option for the high-performance parts we love to work 
and play with. There are two options for liquid-cooling these components, using an all-in-one liquid cooler that consists of a radiator 
connected by factory-sealed tubes to an integrated waterblock and pump, or using a fully custom liquid-cooling system with flexible or 
hardline tubing. The former are easy to install, they deliver fantastic cooling capacity for overclockers, and they’re relatively inexpensive. 
Plus, when compared to a custom loop, AIOs are significantly less complex and don’t require occasional flushing and filling. 
For these reasons and more, AIOs have become extremely popular with everyone from enthusiasts to novice PC builders. Chances 
are pretty good that if you’re reading this, you used an AIO to cool your PC, and we’re also willing to bet that you have at least 
considered making the jump to a fully custom loop. We spoke with Elliot Shiver, PrimoChill’s Senior Technical H20 Specialist to get 
some expert advice on how you can recycle your current AIO to give you a head start with a custom liquid-cooling system.
ES
: It is a little cumbersome and 
messy, and most units have 
barbs of a fixed size instead of G1/4-
inch ports, so changing fittings isn’t an 
option. I have sourced some fittings 
to convert the Asetek units from the 
integrated barbs to G1/4-inch fittings 
on the pump only (the radiator barbs 
ES
: Many people already have an AIO, 
and converting it into a custom loop 
is fun and inexpensive. The performance is still 
acceptable. If a user finds it to their taste, they 
can venture into full custom watercooling.
Q
: What are some of the drawbacks of 
using AIO parts in a custom loop?
Q
: Is it possible to add a larger radiator 
to a 120mm or 240mm AIO?
ES
: Yes! However, your selection 
should be restricted to a thin 
radiator with fairly low restriction, so 
[particularly thick or high-restriction 
radiators] are out; thin radiators such as 
the PrimoChill Eximo, Magicool low-
profile, and XSPC EX radiators would be 
ideal. I would stick to a size of 360mm 
and smaller for a single AIO pump.
Q
: Is it better to completely toss the 
integrated pump/CPU block when 
stripping the AIO for parts?
ES
: The integrated pump/CPU 
block is the most valuable part 
of an AIO; the radiator is almost always 
aluminum and should be tossed if you 
plan on running the loop for more than a 
few days. The total volume of water in a 
system will not have much of an impact—
what you should be concerned with is 
the volume of water the pump can flow 
in a given period of time. This is easy to 
measure by running the pump into an 
empty bottle of known volume and timing 
how long it takes to fill up.
Q
: What are some of the benefits of 
converting an AIO into a custom loop?

delay the inevitable. Products that 
inhibit corrosion are also typically toxic 
and environmentally dangerous, so that 
is always a big consideration. I prefer 
water-based fluid with non-toxic and 
environmentally friendly additives.
Q
: If I turn an AIO into a custom 
loop, do I need to periodically flush 
and refill it?
ES
: This is recommended for even 
the highest-quality of loops 
with only copper and brass parts. I 
recommend every three to four months 
for specialty fluids and eight to 12 
months for clear fluids. A mixed-
metals AIO should be flushed every 
three to six months, depending on 
the volume total in the system, to 
maximize lifespan. An all-copper and 
brass AIO can be flushed once a year 
without complications.
Q
: Does clear tubing have an impact 
on how a cooling system performs 
long-term?
ES
: Clear tubing should not be 
an issue unless the system is in 
direct sunlight; direct UV radiation 
can break down fluid additives and 
encourages algal growth. Keep it out 
of the sun and clear tubing should 
be ok. The major difference between 
dedicated pumps and the AIO pumps 
is flow rate and pressure. The Asetek 
units are especially lacking, while 
the units such as the Fractal Kelvin 
and Swiftech units use scaled-down 
versions of dedicated pumps and are 
much stronger. As long as the loop 
only consists of one or two blocks and 
one or two low-restriction radiators, 
the Asetek unit should do fine, but the 
problem is bleeding air, these pumps 
may not have the flow rate needed 
to bleed all air, requiring a user to 
manually bleed air from the loop. A 
solution for this is to have another 
pump inline just downstream of the 
reservoir to bleed air, after which the 
pump can be deleted from the loop. ■
while they all use copper blocks. If the 
unit you are using has an aluminum 
radiator and you continue to use it in 
your custom loop, this is an issue. If 
you toss it and replace it with a copper 
radiator, you are good to go. When 
filled and sealed from the factory, these 
mixed aluminum and copper units 
have a lifespan of about two years or 
so, depending on frequency of use 
and temperature. What kills these 
units is typically pump failure related 
to increased back-pressure from 
accumulated corrosion on the micro fins 
of the CPU waterblock. 
Corrosion inhibitors are not 
as effective as many people think, 
they only slow down corrosion and 
suspend the corrosion particles in the 
fluid, but that means that eventually 
those suspended particles accumulate 
in the fins of the waterblock, slowly 
increasing temperatures and making the 
pump work ever harder until it quits. 
Corrosion inhibitors such as sodium 
2-ethylhexanoate and additives such 
as ethylene glycol, the much-less-toxic 
propylene glycol, or even glycerin only 
are soldered on), but they are made 
from aluminum. Another issue with 
these adapters is that they don’t fit 
every Asetek-based pump head, only 
the ones with larger-diameter tubing, 
such as the Corsair H100i GTX. Of 
course this is not an issue with units 
that come with G1/4-inch ports from 
the factory, such as the Fractal units 
and the purpose-made expandable AIO 
units like the HX2 series from Swiftech. 
There is a lot to consider when 
choosing a unit to expand; the two 
units on the market that do not require 
any serious modification or scrapping 
parts to expand are the Swiftech units 
and the Fractal Kelvin, both of which 
use all-copper parts and have standard 
threaded ports.
Q
: Is galvanic corrosion something 
I should be concerned about when 
performing this conversion? 
ES
: Corrosion is a major issue if 
you are using any of the units 
that contain an aluminum radiator. 
Only a few units use copper radiators, 
The best thing about a custom loop compared to an AIO is the wow factor.

PC building and modding products and services. Quaintance is also an avid, accomplished modder whose work has appeared 
in CPU’s “Mad Reader Mod” feature (November 2016) and elsewhere.

From Gaming To Modding To 
Starting His Own Business
discoloration there. At this point in 
time, I much prefer working with vinyl 
wraps. The quality of custom printed 
vinyl wraps has improved so much 
over the last decade. For a reasonable 
price you can wrap a case flawlessly 
and transform it into a canvas with 
anything you want. 
Q
: When did you start FrozenQ PC 
Mods, and how did that go down?
AQ
: Not afraid to admit it, but 
I started FrozenQ out of my 
day! It’s actually quite embarrassing with 
how messy the build was.
Q
: Which part of every mod project 
would you skip if you could, and why?
AQ
: Painting. I find painting to 
be the most tedious and time-
consuming part due to the preparation 
and patience it takes. More often than 
not in painted builds, I end up redoing 
several panels at least once since 
I’m simply never happy with them. 
You’ll get a little flake here or some 
Q
: When we talked to you last year 
for “Mad Reader Mod,” you said 
that Orange Nexus was your 17th mod, 
and that you started modding PCs in 
2007 and 2008. How did you get into it 
in the first place?
AQ
: I think it was back in 2004 
when my parents bought me 
my first computer. It was a mid-sized 
HP tower, with quite mediocre and 
generic hardware for the time. I had 
just been exposed to PC gaming by 
my dad and some of his friends, so I 
was keen to try it out. Within a month 
I’d begged and pleaded for them to 
buy me a graphics card. Opening up 
that case to install a classic Radeon 
is what started it all. Wasn’t long 
before the motherboard and memory 
were replaced, followed quickly by 
a Thermaltake Kandalf and some 
disastrous liquid-cooling experiments.
Q
: What was your first mod project like?
AQ
: The first actual mod would 
have been in the aforementioned 
Thermaltake Kandalf. I believe it 
originally housed an AMD Socket 939 
Athlon X2 system, which I quickly 
replaced with an Intel Core 2 Quad 
Q6600 and some original Thermaltake/
Swiftech liquid cooling. Threw in some 
cathodes and LED fans and called it a

for ways to spice up my build at the 
time and make something unique for 
my liquid cooling system. I was a big 
fan of CyberDruid’s work from OCN, 
and I set out to make my own acrylic 
reservoirs. The first one was literally a 
cylinder where the coolant flowed down 
a big spiral insert, almost like a screw. I 
took that idea, and developed that into 
the Liquid Fusion reservoir by making 
a more appealing spiral. Combined 
with some obvious inspiration from the 
T-Virus, we ended up with something 
similar to the Liquid Fusion reservoir 
we have today.
Q
: Prior to Orange Nexus, we remember 
seeing your VaultHunter.exe mod at 
quite a few events and online. When did 
you build it, and what makes it special?
AQ
: This build was a project that 
my brother and I worked on to 
showcase a concept case that we wanted 
to sell. We love mixing it up and doing 
themed builds now and again, and he 
is a big Borderlands fan so it seemed 
natural that his next build needed to 
be Borderlands-themed. I think the 
defining feature of it is the nearly 16 x 
16-inch psycho etching on the window 
side that was illuminated with the 
internal lighting, but you can’t forget 
the etching of our beloved Claptrap on 
the reverse side!
Q
: How did you come up with the 
FrozenQ hex design that you 
incorporate into all your mods?
AQ
: To be honest, I really don’t 
know the answer to this one! 
I think it just started out as something 
I defaulted to for fan grille patterns 
for my early case builds. I’d always 
liked abstract backgrounds for my 
computers and always had several with 
some really cool hex patterns. So the 
hex patterns kind of stuck and became 
part of our branding. 
Q
: You mentioned last year that Orange 
Nexus got its inspiration in part from 
source for the work. In house we do 
laser cutting, full custom builds, vinyl 
case wraps, case painting, custom 
watercooling gear, a variety of plastic 
fabrication, and more. For other things 
like powder-coating, cable-sleeving, 
and metal work, we have some amazing 
shops that provide this for us. 
Q
: The double-helix Liquid Fusion 
reservoirs have been a pretty big hit for 
your company, right? How long have you 
been selling those, and where’d the idea 
come from?
AQ
: We’ve been making those since 
our start in 2009. I was looking 
parents’ garage in 2009. It started as 
one-off reservoir builds for clients online 
and custom builds for friends and family, 
but it wasn’t long before I outgrew the 
garage and landed in a shop of my own. 
Like any small business, it was certainly 
a rocky start, but we made it work 
and have always been happy with the 
progress we’ve made.
Q
: What kinds of modding services 
does the company offer?
AQ
: We offer pretty much anything 
you can think of, and if we 
don’t personally do it, we have close 
partnerships with other shops that we

the Asiimov skin in Counter-Strike: GO; 
do you play a lot of CS:GO?
AQ
: I used to play quite a bit. I joined 
the CS:GO craze late in the 
game, but probably have over 600 hours. 
Nowadays when I have the time, I play either 
Overwatch or PLAYERUNKNOWN’S 
BATTLEGROUNDS.
Q
: Do you attend a lot of LAN events, 
and if so, which ones are your favorite?
AQ
: I do! I try and attend as many as I 
can within reason. We go to a lot of 
the larger ones like DreamHack, but I really 
enjoy the smaller ones, too. My favorite has 
to be my “home” LAN which is the FITES 
250 in central Pennsylvania held every 
February. To date, this LAN has the most 
“chill” feel of any LAN I’ve ever attended. 
It is super laid-back, held in a cozy hotel 
ballroom setting, and the staff and attendees 
are always super awesome and friendly people 
to spend the weekend with.
Q
: It’s time for Five Quick Questions!
1) Case mod or scratch build?
Scratch build, so much more creative 
freedom!
2) Core or Ryzen? 
Core all the way. 
3) AWP or M4?
Negev! (Nah . . . resident AWPer here.)
4) Best shop music: metal or classical?
Between the two, metal, but you’ll 
mostly find us listening to EDM.
5) Borderlands or Borderlands 2? 
You know, as much as I want to say the 
original, I think Borderlands 2 wins here. 
So much more depth and some really 
enjoyable DLC. I think at this point, I 
have at least 5 playthroughs of BL2. ■

The Chipsets, 
They Are A-Changin’
Thanks to a slew of new CPUs from AMD and Intel, 2017 has been a 
great year for PC builders. 
Power users now enjoy a veritable cornucopia of budget, mid-range, and high-end CPUs based on AMD and Intel platforms. And upcoming 
AMD ThreadRipper and Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition chips show huge promise for performance enthusiasts. And most often, a new CPU 
means it’s time for a new motherboard.
Ryzen & ThreadRipper
As of press time, there isn’t a lot of information about Threadripper, but we do know the premium CPUs will be based on the Zen core 
architecture found in Ryzen processors. ThreadRipper CPUs are expected to feature a quad-channel DDR4 memory controller and a huge 
number of PCIe 3.0 lanes (up to 64) for exceptional memory, multi-GPU, and PCIe SSD support. AMD also plans to introduce a new socket 
(TM4) and the X399 chipset with Threadripper. AMD’s AM4 platform and Ryzen processors are geared more toward mid-range and low-
cost builds, though the Ryzen CPUs provide plenty of punch for the price point. Enthusiasts using Ryzen CPUs are most likely to plan builds 
around the X370 chipset because it supports SLI and CrossFire (at x8/x8). Ryzen CPUs are built with a dual-channel memory controller, 
as well as a four dedicated PCIe 3.0 storage lanes for a PCIe SSD. Builders on a budget might also consider boards based on the B350 
chipset, which is similar to X370 but lacks support for dual-GPU setups.
Kaby Lake & Core X
Intel, as you might expect, hasn’t taken AMD’s resurgence in the CPU market lightly. The new Core X-Series processors feature new 
architecture and completely reset Team Blue’s high-end lineup. The X299 chipset is what you’ll need to run a Skylake-X or Kaby Lake-X 
CPU, and X299 is a big improvement over the aging X99 chipset. Whereas X99 had only eight PCIe 2.0 lanes, X299 brings 24 PCIe 3.0 
lanes to deliver the bandwidth necessary for multiple PCIe, NVMe SSDs and additional high-end connectivity, such as USB 3.1 ports. 
Skylake-X processors, like Intel’s Broadwell-E and Haswell-E chips, provide excellent support for multiple GPU configurations and quad-
channel memory. Kaby Lake-E processors, on the other hand, are closer in design to mainstream Kaby Lake chips. With Kaby Lake-X, 
you’re limited to a dual-channel memory controller and 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes for graphics cards. The Z270 chipset and Kaby Lake processors 
are only seven months old, and it speaks volumes about the PC market when this platform is the oldest of the current generation. Similar 
to the X299 chipset, the Z270 chipset features 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes for high-speed connectivity. The Z270 chipset supports both mainstream 
Kaby Lake processors and previous-generation Skylake CPUs.
Custom Touches
Modern AMD and Intel platforms give motherboard makers a fair amount of flexibility when it comes to chipset additions. In this guide, we 
note the most innovative and helpful amenities for power users to help you find the board that’s right for your next build.
BUYER’S GUIDE
52 August2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

MOTHERBOARD
Why You’ll Dig It: The GA-Z270X-Gaming 7 is a tremendous 
value. It comes with serious enthusiast features, such as RAID 
support for triple PCIe SSDs and DDR4 kits at up to 4,133MHz, at 
the cost ($229.99) of a mid-range Z270 motherboard. GIGABYTE 
also provides an abundance of RGB LEDs, which can be split into 
multiple zones, for gorgeous, custom illumination. The motherboard 
also supports RGB, RGBW, and RGB/UV light strips via an RGBW 
pin header to let you sync third-party RGB LED strips. Gamers will 
also like that GIGABYTE includes Creative’s Sound Core3D quad-
core audio processor, as well as Creative’s SBX Pro Studio suite 
where you can tailor sound quality. To make overclocking easier, the 
mainboard includes clear CMOS, power, and reset buttons, as well as 
voltage measurement points.

Scrap The Bloatware From Windows 10
I
t would not be an understatement to 
say we’re fans of Windows 10. From 
a performance and UI standpoint, this 
latest Microsoft OS is one of the best 
yet. But if things were perfect, then we 
wouldn’t focus on Win10 quite so much 
in the pages of Software Tips & Projects. 
One of the most glaring flaws of the 
OS is the slew of unwanted apps that 
install themselves by default. Examples 
of these include the Get Office, Tips, 
Get Skype, Money, News, Get Started, 
Feedback Hub, Microsoft Solitaire 
Collection, One Note, and Health & 
Fitness apps. Sometimes you can remove 
them manually, but following major OS 
updates, such as the Anniversary Update 
or the Creator’s Update, or sometimes 
for no discernable reason whatsoever, 
these apps rise from the dead to once 
again consume your valuable storage 
space, plague your Action Center with 
annoying popup notifications, and make 
you question whether the trusty Add Or 
Remove Programs utility even functions 
properly. 
Laptops and smartphones are no 
strangers to bloatware, but those apps are 
generally from third-party developers and 
organizations that supposedly pay fees 
designed to nibble away at manufacturing 
costs, which in theory should reduce the 
price you pay for these high-tech devices. 
Win10 isn’t any cheaper than previous 
versions of the OS, and for builders 
installing an OEM or retail copy of the 
OS for an existing PC or a system they’ve 
built, there’s nothing to justify the subsidy 
proposition. Even Windows 10 Enterprise 
suffers from the onslaught of preinstalled 
trash. It’s advertising, pure and simple, 
and getting rid of it once and for all isn’t 
as straightforward as you would think. 
Thankfully, there’s a way to do it, at least 
semi-permanently, and we’ll show you how. 
The Easiest Method First
Although performing the (mostly) 
permanent removal process isn’t difficult, 
it’s best to start with the easiest solution 
first. This involves finding the app in the 
all apps list by clicking the Start button, 
right-clicking the icon of the offending 
app, and then clicking Uninstall. 
Performing this commonly works for a 
number of the unwanted utilities such 
as Get Office, Reading List App, Sports, 
Money, News, Get Started, and others. 
You can also click into the search box 
and type add or remove programs and 
then press ENTER to launch the standard 
Windows app uninstalling utility. Then 
just scroll to and click the application 
you want to uninstall and then click the 
Uninstall button. 
Get Rid Of The Zombies
On the utilities that Microsoft appears 
to consider core to the Win10 experience, 
the apps will often have a listing in the 
Add Or Remove Programs utility, but 
the Uninstall button will be greyed out, 
preventing you from easily removing it. 
But we assure you, these apps are mortal. 
Some of the apps that fall into this 
category include Weather, People, Xbox, 
OneNote, Store, and Sticky Notes, among 
others. To expunge these EXEs, you’ll 
need to access the Windows PowerShell 
and use the “Get-AppxPackage” and 
“Remove-AppxPackage” cmdlets 
(pronounced “command-let”). According 
to Microsoft, cmdlets are single-feature 
commands that manipulate objects in 
Windows PowerShell. 
The Windows PowerShell logo is merely a prompt, but the utility itself is actually an incredibly useful 
tool for power users.
62 August2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

correct and try again.” This message will be 
followed by the string you input, with the 
error-inducing section highlighted in red. 
Syntax Matters
You can use the PowerShell to 
effectively remove any application 
that’s not considered imperative, all 
you really need to know is the correct 
syntax of the name of the utility, or 
AUMID (Application User Model ID). 
Unfortunately, these AUMIDs aren’t 
always intuitive. For most of them, the 
utility’s PowerShell-recognizable name is 
all lower-case, with any spaces removed. 
For instance, uninstalling the Get Started 
app is easy to do, all you need to do is 
input “getstarted” between the asterisks 
of the previously mentioned command in 
PowerShell.
Other less intuitive AUMIDs 
include Camera, Maps, and Calculator, 
which are actually recognized as 
“windowscamera,” “windowsmaps,” 
accustomed to initial capping words in 
a string, you can do this, for instance 
by alternately typing 
Ge t - Ap p x Pa c k a g e 
* 3 D B u i l d e r *  
| 
Remove-AppxPackage. 
What is important 
about the syntax of the 
PowerShell commands 
you input, however, are 
the symbols, spaces, 
and of course, spelling. 
In the event that 
you add an unnecessary 
space, or omit a 
hyphen, you’ll likely 
get an error message to 
the effect of, “term not 
recognized as the name 
of a cmdlet, function,

We haven’t spent much time covering 
the ins and outs of PowerShell, but if 
this is your first time using the command 
line-based utility, make sure you exercise 
extreme caution. PowerShell can make 
some pretty low-level configuration 
changes to how your system functions, 
and you won’t get any gentle reminders 
that you might want to think twice before 
you execute a string. 
PowerShell Tutorial
One of the easiest ways to access the 
PowerShell for first timers is to simply 
click in the Windows Search box and type 
powershell, then right-click the top result 
and click Run As Administrator. Click Yes 
when the UAC prompt appears to dismiss 
it. PowerShell’s UI looks a lot like the 
Command Prompt, complete with the 
directory location residing to the left of 
the blinking prompt. 
To get started, let’s delete the 3D 
Builder utility, even though it’s easily 
removable from the Add Or Remove 
Programs utility. At the PowerShell 
prompt type get-appxpackage 
*3dbuilder* | remove-appxpackage
and then press ENTER to execute 
the command. This command doesn’t 
appear to be case-sensitive, so if you’re 
Windows 10 comes preloaded with a bunch of apps that are of questionable value to most end users.

these commands right into PowerShell 
and run them. For those reading the print 
edition, you can type the string out once 
to uninstall an app of your choice, then 
press UP ARROW key in PowerShell to 
display the last string you input, then use 
the LEFT ARROW key to back up to 
the app’s name between the asterisks to 
just change that portion. As a side note, 
if you’re accustomed to using shortcuts 
in Command Prompt, many of them will 
also work in PowerShell. Without further 
ado, here are the uninstall commands for 
a whole bunch of Win10 apps that have 
varying degrees of usefulness. 
To uninstall the Camera app, which 
is utterly wasted on a desktop PC that 
lacks a webcam, use this command: get-
appxpackage *windowscamera* | remove-
appxpackage
The obnoxious Get Office app is 
effectively an advertisement for Microsoft 
Office, so it’s one of the first things we 
typically get rid of after installing Win10. 
To show Get Office to door, use this 
PowerShell command: get-appxpackage 
*officehub* | remove-appxpackage
Get Skype is another advertisement for 
an app that some people love and others 
don’t. Input this command to un-get it: 
get-appxpackage *skypeapp* | remove-
appxpackage
If you’re new to Win10, you might 
like the Get Started app, but for most of 
us, it’s completely unnecessary. Show this 
hand-holding tutor to the door with the 
following command: get-appxpackage 
*getstarted* | remove-appxpackage
The Maps app is vital if you’re using 
Win10 on a mobile device like a tablet or 
laptop, but for desktop users, it’s mostly 
useless, offering little tangible benefits 
compared to a web-based mapping utility. 
Crumple Maps with this command: get-
appxpackage *windowsmaps* | remove-
appxpackage
It’s safe to say that Solitaire was 
one of Windows’ first, and perhaps 
most enduring, killer apps, but many 
users aren’t as keen on the reimagined 
version called the Microsoft Solitaire 
Collection. Use this command to say 
sayonara to Solitaire: get-appxpackage 
Locating Your 
Windows Store 
AUMIDs
A little later in this 
article, we list the 
PowerShell commands 
that you can use to 
expunge numerous 
apps from your system, 
but it is by no means 
an exhaustive list. If 
we failed to list the 
uninstall command 
you’re looking for, you 
can use PowerShell 
to display a list of 
e v e r y  
W i n d o w s 
Store app installed 
on your system . . . 
using a rather verbose 
command. Type this 
exactly as it appears 
here to display them all:
$installedapps = get-AppxPackage
$aumidList = @()
foreach ($app in $installedapps)
{
    foreach ($id in (Get-
AppxPackageManifest $app).package.
applications.application.id)
    {
        $aumidList += $app.
packagefamilyname + “!” + $id
    }
}
$aumidList
The actual AUMIDs appear following 
the “Microsoft.” and after the underscore 
and alphanumeric string of characters. 
Using this method, we discovered dozens 
of Windows Store apps, however, not all 
of them are removable. We’ll take a look 
at the apps you won’t be able to excise 
using PowerShell a bit later. 
Uninstall Commands
For those of you reading this article on 
the web, you can simply copy and paste 
and “windowscalculator.” Other apps 
have even less obvious AUMIDs, such 
as Money, Get Skype, Get Office, and 
Phone Companion, which are referred to 
as “bingfinance,” “skypeapp,” “officehub,” 
and “windowsphone,” respectively. To get 
a tiny inkling of how Microsoft’s software 
is so often built on top of older ideas, 
consider that the AUMID for Groove 
Music is “zunemusic.” 
If you input the wrong AUMID in 
between the asterisks in PowerShell and 
press ENTER, nothing will happen other 
than a new blank prompt will appear. 
This is the same thing that happens if 
you try to remove a program or utility 
that doesn’t exist on your system, which 
means you can run the whole series of 
commands we list in this article without 
checking to see if the app is something 
you have installed. Just make sure you 
actually don’t use the app before removing 
it. (Though, later, we’ll show you how to 
invite all of these banished apps back in 
one fell swoop.) The uninstall commands 
for a variety of built-in apps are listed 
below, however, we do consider many 
of them to be rather useful, and you 
should use this list as a series of optional 
PowerShell commands. 
Some apps you might want to remove require the Windows PowerShell 
and a very specific cmdlet.
64 August2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

get-appxpackage *zunemusic* | remove-
appxpackage
For us, the Movies & TV app is just as 
sufficient as the music app, and we like 
the similar look and feel between the two 
UIs. If you’re less inclined to agree, and 
want to remove this one as well, use this 
command: get-appxpackage *zunevideo*

With the proliferation of Fake News 
threatening to upend your world view 
on a daily basis, it’s important to only 
read news from sources you trust. We’re 
not saying that new gathered by a 
Microsoft-controlled algorithm is always 
untrustworthy, but making sure you’re 
never led astray is as easy as running 
this simple command: get-appxpackage 
*bingnews* | remove-appxpackage
For an app that lets you quickly look 
at photos, with some very basic editing 
functions thrown in for cropping, 
rotating, and color adjusting, the Photos 
app does a decent job. If you prefer to use 
one of the dozens of available alternatives, 
feel free to input the following command: 
get-appxpackage *photos* | remove-

Perhaps our favorite Windows app 
is the Calculator, if only because every 
time we use it, we remember our high 
school algebra teacher swearing that 
we won’t always have a calculator 
handy. She’s probably the only one 
who would think of uninstalling the 
Calculator, but here it is anyway: get-

There are a lot of competent 
alternatives for managing calendar 
events and email, so if the Calendar

valuable space, use this command

remove-appxpackage
OK, it’s no Winamp, but Groove 
Music is one of the handful of Win10 
apps that does a serviceable job of letting 
you manage your music, subscribe to an 
unlimited music service, and buy or listen 
to snippets of new music. If you’d rather 
use anything else, use this command: 
*solitairecollection* | remove-
appxpackage
The Money app isn’t terrible per se, it’s 
just little better than any of a variety of 
financial websites you could bookmark 
and visit instead. Remove it with this:

OneNote, Microsoft’s note-taking and 
collaboration utility is a Win10 preinstall, 
but there are a variety of alternatives 
available that are better or at least just 
as good. To issue OneNote its pink slip,

Microsoft has had mixed results when 
it comes to the firm’s social media efforts,

Microsoft’s Phone Companion app is 
one of those things that some people love, 
and others just have no use for it. You

or not. Microsoft Edge, Cortana, Contact 
Support, and Windows Feedback are just 
a few examples of apps that are off-limits. 
It’s In Your Hands
The ability to take control of virtually 
every aspect of the software is one of the 
reasons we love Windows. Microsoft’s 
latest OS really does let you tap into a 
remarkable number of the UI features 
and OS mechanics. And even though 
we just got done mentioning a few of 
the things you can’t do via the incredibly 
powerful PowerShell, we’re pretty sure 
someone somewhere has figured out 
a workaround to accomplish these 
seemingly forbidden tasks. That’s the 
other reason we love Windows: there’s 
a massive army of empowered users 
tirelessly working to find ways to improve 
the platform every day. ■
The Forbidden Apps
If you’ve found yourself trying to get 
rid of an app, and simply can’t using the 
Add Or Remove Programs utility or a 
PowerShell cmdlet, then chances are good 
you’re trying to toss one of the handful of

Store from your system: get-appxpackage

fans. But if you’re not a huge fan of the 
Bing-aggregated sports news, run this

| remove-appxpackage
The Voice Recorder app is one we 
rarely have occasion to use. If you feel 
the same, run the following command 
to silence it: get-appxpackage 
*soundrecorder* | remove-appxpackage
Win10’s live tiles are really hit or miss 
with users. We generally like being able 
to see a concise five-day forecast when 
we hit the Start button. If you don’t ever 
use the weather app, run this command 
to rain on its parade: get-appxpackage 
*bingweather* | remove-appxpackage
We try to not get too PCMasterRace in

platform will end up missing out on

interested in Microsoft’s piece of the 
gaming sphere, then you’ll probably

What Today’s Gaming Groups Use To Win At Organization
Another sea change driving 
competitive gaming is its evolution into 
a bona fide spectator sport. To be sure, 
there are plenty of people who follow 
a particular game, and the professional 
teams that battle each other, because they 
enjoy playing that game themselves, but 
the most popular games are now drawing 
in viewers who just came to watch, so to 
speak. According to a report from market 
research firm NewZoo, 42% of people 
watching the top three eSports (LoL, 
DOTA 2, and CS:GO) don’t actually play 
the game itself. Whether these games’ 
matches on Twitch that eSports is 
capable of producing the same level of 
entertainment we’ve come to expect from 
traditional sporting competitions. We’re 
not yet to the point where League of 
Legends is competing with the NFL for 
eyeballs and ad dollars, for example, but 
the momentum propelling professional 
events, tournaments, and teams is now 
impossible to ignore . . . or stop. Already 
a half-billion-dollar industry and poised 
to generate close to $1.5 billion in 
revenue by 2020, competitive gaming as a 
profitable endeavor is only getting started.
O
ver the last few years, videogames 
have become a lot more exciting. 
Sure, to a certain extent that’s self-
evident; videogames have always been 
exciting. We wouldn’t log hour after

if it weren’t for those strategically 
administered doses of dopamine for each 
achievement completed, trophy earned, 
or victory secured.

basement years ago, but it’s now obvious 
to even those who don’t regularly tune 
in to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 
Although eSports fanatics can regularly identify the top teams that frequently make the main stage at professional gaming’s most prestigious tournaments, 
plenty of work happens behind the scenes to keep the best of the best in fighting form. The good news for gamers at all levels is that many of the tools pros

In 2017, Liquid was seeking a full-time 
translator, as well as a handful of other 
non-gaming positions, for its LoL squad. 
They’re not alone.
As we went to press, Blizzard 
announced a series of rules regarding 
player compensation that Overwatch 
League franchise owners must abide 
by. Every league player must receive 
a guaranteed one-year contract with 
an option to extend that contract for 
another year. The minimum annual salary 
for players is $50,000, and teams must 
also provide their players with health 
insurance, retirement savings plans, and 
performance-based bonuses.
“Today, eSports teams have a better 
understanding of their own business 
models,” says Michael Daudign, marketing 
director at Toornament (https://www.
toornament.com). “They know how to get 
money and how to invest this money.”
As professional eSports teams and 
other serious clans and guilds battle 
each other for the spoils of victory, 
whether that’s glory, cold hard cash, or 
both, the stakes continue climbing 
of franchise faces throughout LoL and 
other popular videogames.
Although we have no shortage of 
colossal, sold-out venues, fantastically 
large prize pools (this year’s International 
topped $20 million in total prize money, 
with over $9.1 million split between world 
champion Wings Gaming) or well-known 
eSports personalities, top teams consist of 
far more than what you see on the group 
stage. Indeed, continuing the traditional 
pro sports team analogy is appropriate, 
because an entire support infrastructure 
underpins the best and most competitive 
squads in eSports. Small, fledgling teams 
on the fringes of the pro scene may rely on 
a single “manager” who sees to his players’ 
offline needs, but established franchises 
regularly employ entire teams to keep their 
eAthletes in fighting form and focused 
on the next match. Coaches, chefs, 
physical therapists, sports psychologists, 
webmasters, sales managers—plenty of 
work goes into winning championships 
beyond precise headshots and clutch 
counter ganks. For example, at the end 
of 2016 Team Liquid sought to hire a 
audiences are participants themselves 
or among the millions of spectators 
watching on Twitch, their appeal as 
genuine sporting events is undeniable.
And like traditional pro sports, 
eSports have developed a high degree of 
visibility. DOTA 2’s The International, 
for example, has been held at Seattle’s 
Key Arena every year since 2012. The 
best teams and players maintain devoted 
fanbases who follow them with the 
same dedication as Bay Area basketball 
aficionados give Stephen Curry or 
Bostonians heap upon New England 
Patriots starting quarterback Tom Brady. 
When LoL megastar Lee Sang-hyeok, 
more commonly known as Faker, took 
to Twitch in early 2017, SK Telecom T1’s 
renowned mid-laner pulled in more than 
245,000 viewers. Such an audience made 
Faker’s stream the most-watched of any 
individual streamer to use the platform 
and easily surpassed the live viewerships 
of other games. Faker’s fame is arguably 
the best recent example of a recognizable

but it can also collect each member’s 
assortment of personal gaming-related 
accounts, displaying things like Xbox Live 
IDs and Twitch profiles.
“We’re in a really exciting position 
right now,” Brown says. “We’ve laid the 
foundation to scale to hundreds of games, 
higher. Recognizing teams’ desire 
to defeat their rivals, a number of 
companies are developing tools to

Beyond The Friends List
By default multiplayer games let 
players connect with each other and form 
groups to accomplish shared objectives, 
whether that’s bringing down the 
opposing team’s Ancient or slaying a raid 
boss. Social media integration also gives 
players another way to maintain contact.
However, merely joining forces with 
friends and like-minded gamers isn’t the 
same as coordinating a dedicated team or 
guild over the long haul. Managers must 
keep their teams together and focused on 
regular practice sessions and tournaments, 
not to mention attract new talent to 
supplement their roster(s).
“The challenge teams face is that most 
communication tools are only really good for 
one form of communication,” says Guilded 
(https://www.guilded.gg) founder and CEO 
Eli Brown. “Discord or Skype are great for 
real-time communication, but not so great 
for scheduling events or recruiting. Forums 
are great for sharing strategies and builds, but 
not so great for real-time communication. It’s 
challenging to manage all of these different 
forms of communication.”
Guilded, which is now in beta on iOS 
and Android (Windows and Mac OS X 
versions are in alpha), aims to be teams’ 
one-stop shop for communication and 
coordination. The service covers a wide 
range of games (all of the major titles 
and many others). It hooks into Discord 
for communication and uses Discord 
bots for a variety of tasks. With Discord 
integration, calendar announcements, video, 
applications, etc. can be automatically 
pushed to relevant team members.
Elsewhere, Guilded aims to be as 
lightweight as possible, getting teams 
and guilds off the ground in seconds, 
and presents groups with a streamlined 
calendar for scheduling practice 
sessions, raids, tournaments, and other 
team activities. Guilded’s Members tab 
A League Of Their Own: Q&A With Zack Johnson, 
Founder Of ggLeap & ggCircuit On Amateur eSports
Zack Johnson got his start in LAN gaming the 
way a lot of us did—small groups of gamers 
gathering in small venues. Johnson’s journey 
began 13 years ago, when he hosted LAN 
parties in his local church before later setting 
up Xbox consoles and PCs in the spare space 
in some of his businesses. Today, Johnson’s 
turned his passion for competitive gaming 
at the local level into ggLeap, a platform for 
gaming centers and retail outlets around the 
globe. Johnson spoke with us about the ever-
changing landscape of eSports.
Q: How has the explosion of professional 
eSports altered the course of gaming at the 
local level?
ZJ: Games are building online “ranks” into 
their system more these days that players and 
teams are content to play more casually and 
do not seek out opportunities for additional 
competition.
Q: For most traditional sports, we have a very 
well established tiered structure: professional, 
collegiate, and high school. In some sports, 
fiece competition extends to the middle school 
and youth sports level. Why do you think this 
hierarchy doesn’t really exist in eSports?
ZJ: Right now, the cream of the crop just 
plays together online, so anyone below that 
level just doesn’t participate due to the fact 
that they will get stomped.
The reason why high school vs. high school 
competitions are fun in sports is because as 
kids grow up the teams constantly change 
but are usually pretty equal in skill sets so 
everyone feels like they have a chance. If you 
play high school basketball, you aren’t going 
up against Lebron James in a tournament.
Q: To a certain extent, we’re getting more 
structure at the collegiate level, thanks 
to groups like Tespa (fka Texas eSports 
Association) and colleges themselves 
launching eSports programs. Do you envision 
formal, school-sponsored eSports eventually 
taking root in a similar fashion?
ZJ: Unfortunately, there are problems 
getting a lot of the most popular games 
into high schools. Look at one of the most 
competitive eSports title around, Counter-
Strike. Schools won’t sanction games like 
that, which involve guns and killing your 
opponent. Maybe something like Rocket 
League would work, but nothing with any 
mature themes.
Q: What role do you envision LAN centers, 
gaming cafés, etc. taking in developing 
eSports at the local level?
ZJ: Personally, my own centers were started 
because we want to encourage social gaming.  
Get out of the basement and actually get to 
know players in real life that live around you.  
My favorite example is when the shy, small, 
socially awkward high school sophomore 
was teamed up with a collegiate scholarship 
football lineman in Halo.  The two of them 
actually became really good friends, and 
without my center they would never even 
have crossed paths.

were likely to succeed at the pro level and 
then acquire them at deep discount. While 
big-budget organizations relied on baseball 
scouts to tell them what players “looked” 
good, others, such as the Oakland Athletics 
and its general manager Billy Beane, turned 
to spreadsheets and stats in their hunt for 
big leaguers.
Sabermetrics revolutionized baseball. 
It spread like wildfire among MLB 
front offices and has permeated other 
professional sports, as well. Now, the 
sabermetric philsophy has made its way 
to eSports, and companies have seized 
the opportunity to put another tool in 
teams’ toolbox.
Mobalytics (https://mobalytics.gg) is 
a startup headquartered in Los Angeles 
that’s bringing analytics to eSports; at the 
time of this writing its focus was League 
of Legends, but the company already 
has plans bring its service to CS:GO, 
Overwatch, DOTA 2, and other popular 
games. Poised to celebrate its first birthday 
at the time of this writing, Mobalytics has 
had a busy year. After beating a field of 24 
other startups to win TechCrunch’s 2016 
“Good teams and clubs make it clear 
what is expected of each team member 
so they can focus on the competition, 
not the logistics,” McDonald says. 
“For example, when you have a central 
schedule, one person can update the 
schedule and have it sync to everyone’s 
phones. That way, everyone has the latest 
schedule in their personal calendar on 
their phone without having to watch for a 
blizzard of texts about schedule changes.”
Moneyball Meets eSports
Before it was a critically acclaimed and 
Oscar-nominated film, Michael Lewis’ 
“Moneyball” revealed a new approach 
Major League Baseball teams were 
implementing to gain a competitive edge 
against their opponents. As deep-pocketed 
teams used their wealth to assemble all-star 
rosters, teams with limited budgets required 
creative and unorthodox strategies to find 
quality players. By applying sabermetrics, 
a term that now broadly refers to using 
statistical analysis to more accurately assess 
player potential, these teams were able to 
identify unheralded baseball players who 
platform. “The more competitive the 
team, the more organized they often are,” 
says Ken McDonald, TeamSnap’s Chief 
Growth Office. “We see this in all sports 
including gaming groups.”
According to McDonald, TeamSnap 
started out of its founders’ frustration 
running their own teams. They built the 
platform for themselves, but interest in it 
grew through word of mouth, and TeamSnap 
made its tools available to the public.
TeamSnap focuses heavily on planning 
and coordinating team events. There are a 
variety of scheduling features, obviously, 
as TeamSnap lets team managers plan 
practices, matches, and tournaments 
and then sync the dates and times across 
teammates’ devices and calendar apps 
(such as iCal, Google, or Outlook). It can 
track player availability, send messages to 
teammates, and collect payments. Although 
eSports teams and guilds rarely require their 
members to pay dues or fees, it could be 
a handy way for a gaming clan leader to 
register for an entire LAN party table to 
ensure everyone is seated together and then 
let the rest of the squad reimburse him later.
Numbers don’t lie, and Los Angeles-based startup Mobalytics is banking on using statistical analysis to uncover insights that will help players up their game. The company’s 
software collects data about a player’s performance and assigns a GPI (Gamer Performance Index) that breaks down strengths and weaknesses into several key metrics.

respective games, and they’re a staple of 
most LAN parties, as well. 
We usually see the thrilling side of 
tournaments—watching our favorite 
eSports team claw its way through the 
bracket or actually playing in tournaments 
ourselves—but someone has to put 
everything together. It doesn’t matter if 
a tournament is taking place at gaming’s 
highest level of competition or at a 25-
seat weekend LAN party, almost every 
tournament requires dedicated personnel 
to ensure that tournament goes off without 
a hitch.
In the last few years, competing 
platforms have helped simpify 
tournament organization for both 
tremendous, sold-out arena events and 
local gatherings alike. Toornament, 
which boasts a client list of DreamHack, 
Activision Blizzard, and Ubisoft, to name 
a few, is a free service that puts a small 
arsenal of features at organizers’ fingertips. 
Since the end of 2015, Toornament has 
hosted nearly 60,000 tournaments on 
its platform. Another flourishing eSports 
tournament service provider is Battlefy 
(https://battlefy.com), which has a similar 
cachet among the eSports industry, as 
ways; together, they constitute what 
StatsHelix calls its ProTool.
Arguably the killer app of ProTool is 
its heatmaps feature. Another technique 
borrowed from pro sports, heatmaps 
provide powerful visual data about team 
and player performance. In CS:GO, the 
ProTool’s heatmaps details team positioning, 
where kills happen, and more. ProTool also 
lets players develop online playbooks akin 
to what sports teams use, and professional 
athletes are taking notice.
“[There are] strategies and tactics 
in playbooks just like other mainstream 
sports,” former NFL defensive lineman 
Ricky Lumpkin told PvP Live. “I saw what 
[eSports teams] Liquid and F3 had with 
StatsHelix, and I can tell you what I told 
them when I saw it: ‘This looks like the 
same things I get from coaches to study.’”
A Little Friendly Competition
When you want to crown a 
champion, whether in eSports or any 
other sport, a tournament will let teams 
and individual players slug it out until 
only one remains. Tournaments like 
The International or the Halo World 
Championship are the pinnacle of their 
Disrupt San Francisco Startup Battlefield 
(and taking home $50,000 in first-place 
prize money), Mobalytics secured $2.6 
million in seed funding from a number of 
investment firms.
Of course, videogames already lend 
themselves to statistical analysis, but 
Mobalytics wants to go beyond simple 
measures such as kill:death ratio. 
“The three major U.S. sports are all using 
increasing analytics as years go by,” says 
Amine Issa, Ph.D., Mobalytics co-founder. 
“The big advantage videogames have is that 
every piece of data is recorded by nature of 
the eSport being played on a PC.”
The front end, as it were, of the behind-
the-scenes number crunching Mobalytics’ 
services does is its Gamer Performance 
Index (GPI). Mobalytics relies on machine-
learning algorithms to assess a player’s 
overall performance and then represents 
that performance with a numerical GPI. 
The top-level GPI score breaks down 
further into a series of other metrics, such as 
Teamplay, Fighting Skill, Toughness, Vision, 
and others. Each of these is further divided 
and quantified. For example, Mobalytics 
scores someone’s Teamplay skill based on 
the following criteria: Ward Participation, 
Assists Participation, Objective Play, 
Team Fight Participation, Utility, and 
Kill Stealing. Receiving low scores in any 
of Mobalytics’ metrics helps players find 
holes in their game and gives them a much 
better idea of what they need to work on in 
each practice session. Mobalytics prepares 
pre- and post-game analysis, keeps track 
of players’ personal records, displays a host 
of statistics, filters results according to 
the specific champion a player used in a 
particular match, and so forth.
Currently in private beta, Mobalytics 
isn’t limited to professional eSports teams, 
although some are already using the service. 
Other gamers can sign up for an invite and 
use the tool to measure their performance 
in LoL, and Issa says an open beta is set to 
launch at the beginning of August.
StatsHelix (https://statshelix.com), 
which currently serves professional 
CS:GO teams, supplements the stats it 
presents with a browser-based 2D viewer 
that recaps matches in a number of useful 
Once upon a time, gaming tournaments came together by passing a sheet of paper from seat to seat. Now, 
platforms like Toornament automate much of the process, both for organizers and competitors.
74 August2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

says Jeff Lefebvre, founder and CEO of 
LanHUB (https://lanhub.net). “We do 
this by providing a suite of tools that is 
simple to set up, easy to use, and gives 
players and staff a place to call home.”
As LAN parties evolve from informal 
gatherings of friends to bigger events 
that hope to attract other local gamers, 
Lefebvre says services like LanHUB can 
minimize growing pains. “We observed 
that when ‘living room parties’ grows to 
gym-sized events, unexpected problems 
start to occur. There are too many players 
to manage, and players are left with a 
sour taste.” Organizers use LanHUB 
for obvious administrative tasks such as 
player registration and seat maps, but it 
can also conduct straw polls and integrate 
with Twitch.
Regardless of where eSports teams 
and other gamers choose to compete, 
software companies and service providers 
are developing offerings aimed at taking 
care of a lot of the drudge work. With 
the logistics under control, we can focus 
on what really matters: the spirit of 
competition and the thrill of victory. ■
the competitions, while ggLeap is the 
management platform centers can use to 
keep their operation running smoothly.
Johnson stresses automation and 
gamification (players using the services 
earn virtual currency they can then 
redeem for prizes, concessions, etc.) as key 
elements ggLeap and ggCircuit address. 
“We can help them get up and running 
efficiently, and our software keeps them 
running. They can then focus on the 
marketing and events side for their stores.
“Our goal is always automation and 
what we call the gamification of eSports. 
We want the competition itself to be a 
game. Climb the leaderboards, see your 
name in lights, play multiple games, and 
of course earn prizes.”
Despite the explosion of eSports and 
online multiplayer gaming, LAN parties 
across the country continue to thrive, 
but that doesn’t mean these events will 
succeed by default. LAN party organizers 
are also turning to specialized service 
providers to assist with logistics.
“We believe in helping LAN parties 
grow without getting in their way,” 
Riot Games, EA, ESL, DreamHack, and 
others have used its platform.
Although services like Toornament 
and Battlefy serve the biggest and most 
prestigious tournaments in eSports, 
Daudign says that competitive gamers and 
tournament organizers at all levels stand to 
gain from using one of these services.
“[Any tournament organizer] has to 
run their tournament according to best 
practices for each specific game,” he says. 
“If they do it manually, then the local 
community won’t follow, they won’t 
register. They’ll tell the organizer, ‘This is 
how we play the game.’”
Daudign adds that that automation 
is essential as eSports tournament service 
providers and organizers plan competitions in 
the future. Providers’ software can connect to 
game servers, and APIs let organizers embed 
tournament brackets, forms, and live results 
directly into their websites. “Game developers 
and publishers are taking their role in eSports 
more seriously, so they need help to make 
sure the community has the tools to integrate 
with their games. They use us to bring the 
best practices in game tournaments to the 
games themselves.”
Getting The Gamer 
Next Door
As gamers continue to 
battle each other online, local 
establishments and event 
planners face a conundrum: 
How do you lure these 
players out of their lairs and 
get them to gather together 
and play locally? 
Zack Johnson, founder of 
ggLeap (https://www.ggleap.
com) and ggCircuit (https://
www.ggcircuit.com), believes 
that local gaming centers 
possess plenty of potential. 
ggLeap and ggCircuit are his 
one-two punch to give these 
establishments, along with 
retail outlets and other physical 
locations, the necessary tools 
to keep gamers and customers 
engaged and excited. He 
says that ggCircuit handles 
Brick-and-mortar establishments such as LAN centers and gaming lounges continue to be places where gamers can 
come together and compete locally. Modern service providers such as ggLeap help these places automate the game 
management and competition processes, leaving owners to handle the business side of their operations.

Habitat For Humanity

Epic Games   •   www.epicgames.com/fortnite
Epic Games’ answer to gamers in search of something new? Everything! 
(No, not our May 2017 issue Game Of The Month.) Hungry for a horde mode 
showdown? Play Fortnite! Do you prefer your lighthearted heroes in the spirit of 
Overwatch and Team Fortress 2, rather than overmuscled grimdark soldiers? 
How about Fortnite? Oh, you’ve long pined for an FPS version of Minecraft? 
[Slides controller across the table, with a tempting whisper, “Fortnite.”]
Fornite keeps the prologue short and sweet: Ninety-eight percent of the 
world’s population vanished after the Storm rolled in, and it’s about to make 
life miserable for the remaining 2%. You see, when this tempest starts 
roiling, the forecast calls for a 100% chance of bloodthirsty Husks. What’s a 
resourceful, reasonably well-armed survivor to do?
You dig into Fortnite’s bread and butter: builders building buildings. Firepower 
alone can hold off the Storm’s legions for a while, but to truly outlast wave 
after wave of monsters, you need that fort, which can range from Hooverville-
inspired shack to an upcycled Minas Tirith tribute. The one silver lining of 
the overwhelming majority of humankind vanishing is that there isn’t much 
competition for building mats, so start scavenging.
Fortnite’s classes each come with distinct specializations; a couple of them 
are rightfully tied to gathering supplies and constructing more resilient bases, 
but otherwise the Outlander, Soldier, Ninja, and Constructor all have relative 
analogs in other games. The tech tree is executed reasonably well and turns 
out to be quite expansive. We also liked the small mountain of weapons 
Fornite lets you customize, even if, again, the overall feel is all too familiar.
So even though Fortnite falls short of revolutionizing the genre, that really 
doesn’t matter because it’s just a hell of a lot of fun. Scouring maps for 
resources and assembling your secondhand ramparts is a blast, and 
Fortnite’s emphasis on co-op rather than PvP is, to be honest, refreshing in 
a climate of big-budget games angling to be the next eSport. Sometimes, 
you just want to waste a few bad guys without worrying about what a 
slip-up will do to your ladder rank or worse, your spot on the team.
Until 2018, when Fortnite becomes free-to-play, it will cost you at least 
40 bucks for early access privileges. We say “at least,” because you can 
splash out even more cash, up to $149.99, for premium editions that are 
bursting with loot piñatas (no, really), XP boosts, hero packs, and more. It’s 
not hard to see how Epic has stitched together a money-making monster 
while simultaneously dangling a $0 price tag in front of gamers next year.
The real question isn’t whether you should play Fortnite—you absolutely 
should; it’s whether you should pay for the head start. You might be tempted 
to snark that Fortnite is little more than a mashup of Left 4 Dead 2/Overwatch/
Dungeon Defenders/Etc./Etc./Etc., but let that hot take simmer for a few 
rounds. Sure, you’ve played Fortnite before, but you haven’t played Fortnite,
and it won’t take much of the latter before you stop caring about the former. ■
Yeah, we know you have blogs to post, video to encode, reports to write, and code to compile. We do, 
too, but you have to take a break once in a while (and maybe blow some stuff up). That’s why each 
month we give you the lowdown on what to expect from the latest interesting games.

ROKH
BY ANDREW LEIBMAN
$24.99 (PC)   •   ESRB: (M)ature  •   Nvizzio Creations
www.rokhthegame.com
If you’ve ever wanted to know what it would be like to be stranded 
on Mars with naught but your spacesuit, a really fancy screwdriver, 
and your wits, then the Steam Early Access game ROKH is as close as 
you’re going to get. The game takes place in the near future. You are 
a science-minded explorer (or explorer-minded scientist), not unlike 
Mark Watney, the central figure of Andy Weir’s novel “The Martian.” The 
difference here is that the major catastrophe has already occurred to 
your predecessors.
You are part of a second wave of colonists to take up residence on the 
Red Planet. As you’ll soon discover, something tragic and mysterious 
happened to the first wave, and you can wander around abandoned 
structures and discover clues aplenty. From what’s currently playable 
in the alpha build, you can choose to focus on building a base and 
planting roots, or you can set out to explore the harsh and unforgiving 
portions of the map to the south and east, without much to hold you 
back other than your constant need to periodically re-up on oxygen, 
water, suit power, rad shields, and food. 
This is a survival/crafting/building game inspired by the likes of Ark: 
Survival Evolved, Rust, The Forest, and 7 Days To Die. I’ll be the first 
to admit that survival games in this vein are divisive, and generally 
speaking, most of us already know whether we love them or hate 
them. In the several hours that I’ve spent playing ROKH, I’ve found 
nothing that would tempt those who are critical of the genre to give 
it a shot. But for those who find a certain joy in punching trees, being 
homicidal nudists, or spending hours upon hours upgrading tools to 
upgrade other tools, ROKH shows signs of potential greatness.
One of the major things ROKH has going for it is its deep crafting 
system. Even though we were only able to access the first few levels 
of tools and components, transitioning from tier-two items to tier-three 
was an absolute thrill, and really opened up some vital components, 
machines, and upgrades that made life on the desolate planet much 
more survivable. During my time with the game, a major update 
launched which managed to streamline the crafting experience without 
stripping away any of the depth. 
The other major plus for us was the setting. The Mars landscape looks 
as magnificent as it is deadly; stepping into a steep crater can result in 
a quick demise. Storms and meteor showers plague the planet surface, 
and there are hints that more dangerous foes are waiting just out of 
sight. Resources are abundant, but to take full advantage of them will 
take time. 
Unfortunately, the current state of the game is such that framerates can 
bounce around wildly depending on what’s onscreen. We experienced 
repeated crashes, and sometimes the server where we’ve spent 
a majority of our time was simply not accessible. The UI, although 
improved following the recent update, was still a bit of an unintuitive 
mess. While we’re of the opinion that hand-holding tutorials can sap 
the joy of discovery in games of this type, Nvizzio Creations needs to 
better convey to the player how a tool functions in various situations. 
In case you’re new to the game, banging the wrench against your 
automated Tile Press won’t fix it. 
This game shows a lot of promise, but it still needs work. The 
developers have committed to a strict launch window, within 12 
months of May’s Early Access. We’re looking forward to checking 
back in with ROKH early next year to see if the game lives up to its 
potential. ■

Beta Verdict: We’re Good
BY CHRIS TRUMBLE
$59.99 (PC, Xone, PS4)  •   ESRB: (T)een   •   Activision   
www.destinythegame.com
Bungie recently gave Destiny fans everywhere an early peek at its upcoming 
mega-sequel, Destiny 2, in the form of a beta that was open first to folks who 
pre-ordered the game on PlayStation 4 (this began on Tuesday, July 18), then 
to those who pre-ordered it on Xbox One (July 19). The beta continued in its 
restricted form through Friday, July 21, at which time it became open to all 
PS4 and Xbox players regardless of their pre-order status, and although it 
was originally scheduled to wrap up on Sunday, July 23, Bungie announced 
via Twitter that it was extending the beta through Tuesday the 25th.
The beta was pretty straightforward; it let you choose a titan, warlock, or 
hunter, and then dropped you immediately into an introductory campaign 
mission called “Homecoming,” which picked up with a scene from the 
“Our Darkest Hour” trailer that Bungie unveiled at E3. The Vanguard (the 
hunter Cayde-6, warlock Ikora Rey, and titan Zavala) are in the tower when 
a massive alien fleet attacks the city. Your character is returning from . . . 
somewhere (maybe a strike, maybe a patrol, who knows?) and your ghost 
(not a Dinklebot, unfortunately) tries and fails to reach the Tower on coms.
When you arrive, the city is in flames and Cabal forces are everywhere, and 
the fighting starts. The mission didn’t take terribly long to play through, but it 
was a nice introduction (or re-introduction, if your Destiny skills have lapsed 
like mine did) to the game’s excellent FPS combat. Once you completed the 
mission, which ended with a very cool cinematic that introduced Dominus 
Ghaul, leader of the Cabal’s elite Red Legion, you were taken into orbit and 
given three new activities to choose from.
One was a three-player strike called “The Inverted Spire,” and it showed off 
a bit of one of Destiny 2’s new world locations, the minor planet Nessus. In 
the strike, you learn that Nessus is a Vex planet, but that the Red Legion has 
begun drilling deep into the planet for something on a massive scale. The Vex, 
of course, take exception to this Cabal incursion, and as a result you’ll see 
Vex and Cabal forces fighting each other almost as often as you have to fight 
either one of them. (You’ll even fight a few Fallen here and there, for some 
reason that may or may not become clear later.)
The other two activities are Crucible (player vs. player) matches. One is a 
Quickplay match of the Control match type, which takes place in a level 
called “Endless Vale,” and the other a Competitive match of the Countdown 
match type played in a map called “Midtown.” For now at least, competitive 
multiplayer is limited to two teams of four players. The Control match type 
is one most multiplayer shooter fans are very familiar with; variants of it 
are found in Overwatch and Halo, among others. Countdown is somewhat 
reminiscent of Counter-Strike’s bomb scenarios, except that there are two, 
fixed-position bombs placed at locations in the map. One team tries to 
detonate, the other to defuse.
The PvP matches are fast and fun, and PvP should be a huge draw again this 
time around. Ultimately, though, the biggest changes in the game look so far to 
be in the quantity, quality, and variety of PvE activities compared with the first 
game, and if you were roundly disappointed in the campaign and story-based 
activities in Destiny, you might want to give Destiny 2 a look when it ships. One 
thing for sure the recent beta demonstrates is that Bungie still knows how to 
make a great shooter; the control, mechanics, and technical aspects of the 
game (sound and graphics) were mostly impeccable. There were a few areas of 
concern with regards to balance, ammo drop rates, ability cooldowns, and the 
like, but Bungie has addressed those in positive ways, as well.
Long story short, if you liked Destiny, you may well like Destiny 2 even more, 
and you may like Destiny 2 a lot even if you weren’t a fan. It’s early, of course, so 
we’ll see. The game ships for consoles on September 6, and for PC on October 
24. In the meantime, if you’re interested in checking out the game on PC for the 
first time, good news! Bungie says there will be a PC beta in August.
See you in there! ■

Dragon Age Lite

$14.99 (PC)   •   ESRB: n/a   •   Event Horizon
www.evehor.com
One of the things we love most about Steam is that is provides 
a mechanism for small developers and publishers to get their 
games in front of players who are interested, and although there 
are plenty of indie disappointments, you can find some gems if 
you look. We recently bumped into an indie title called Tower of 
Time, developed and published by a small developer in Poland 
called Event Horizon, and had quite a bit of fun with it.
Event Horizon launched Tower of Time as an Early Access title on July 
13. The game is a single-player,  isometric top-down dungeon crawler 
with RTS elements that takes place inside a huge, multi-level tower that 
was unearthed during an earthquake in a dying world. Your character 
was drawn to the tower as a child, and you briefly entered the structure 
and talked to a presence that said you’d return someday to claim the 
power waiting there for you. Many years later, you indeed re-enter the 
tower in search of resources to help the citizens of your city, where 
continuous failed crops and the scarcity of clean water have threatened 
your people’s future.
You initially return with two trusted friends and warriors, a prototypical 
male fighter and a female archer. They encourage you to let them go 
ahead and scout the tower and make it safe for you, which works out 
as you have a date with a large crystal throne you first glimpsed as a 
child. From that point on, you direct your companions’ actions via the 
power of the throne, and as the game progresses you are introduced to 
new characters to add to your party of up to four.
Your team will explore the tower, fight monsters, and gain valuable insight 
as to what your world was like before its decline, as well as what caused it 
to begin dying in the first place. Most battles you can choose to initiate or 
postpone, as you can see many of the monsters in the tower milling about 
and waiting to kill you. Some battles, though, are unavoidable: sometimes 
your party is ambushed, and other times you have to engage an enemy 
force to progress further into the tower and solve its mysteries.
Once you enter combat, the game switches perspectives to give you 
a broader view of the battlefield, and you are allowed to position 
your adventurers wherever you like prior to starting the fight. This is 
advantageous for getting your ranged fighters and casters where they 
can be most effective, although you’ll need to move all your characters 
around quite a bit during some fights. Once you start each battle, 
enemies will spawn from multiple locations on the map and attack, and 
you’ll control your team members’ movement and abilities in real-time 
while managing their health, mana, and ability cooldowns. 
The game’s combat isn’t unlike the Tactical View in EA and 
Bioware’s Dragon Age games, and although you can’t freeze the 
fight completely, there is a Slow Time button that you can use as 
much as you like when things get hairy. And things will get hairy; 
the first few fights might suggest otherwise, but once you have a 
full party and have to manage ranged DPS, melee, and healing/buffs 
in real time, you’ll be glad you can slow things down occasionally.
There are plenty of time-worn fantasy tropes on display in Tower 
of Time, and we ran across a minor glitch or two, as well, but 
given its Early Access status and its very budget-friendly price 
of $15, we think there’s more than enough fun in this game to 
outweigh such concerns. ■

Q&A With Lenny Tang
MSI’s No. American Laptop Marketing 
Mgr. On New Raider Gaming Laptops
CPU and GPU options the GE63 and 
GE 73 offer. 
LT
: The GE Raider series will offer 
only the Intel Core i7-7700HQ 
(2.8GHz to 3.8GHz) for all Raider 
configs. The GPU will vary from GTX 
1050, 1050 Ti, 1060, and 1070.
Q
: Also, it looks from what we’ve 
seen like these laptops have 
beefed-up cooling. Can you tell us 
about the new Cooler Boost 5 system? 
LT
: Cooler Boost 5 is a step up from 
previous notebook coolers, and we’ve 
added an additional copper heatpipe for 
the GPU. Cooler Boost 5 now comes with 
on any laptop, period. When I first 
got to play around with it, this was the 
first thing I tried out. The new Giant 
Speakers by Dynaudio sound like 
external speakers installed onto a laptop 
up to a whopping 106db. There are now 
four speakers, two dedicated bass and 
two for treble. The built-in ESS DAC 
fills the room with hi-res audio up to 
192KHz/24bit. The YouTube music 
videos I watched had no distortion 
whatsoever, even at 100% volume; treble 
was clear and crisp, while bass was deep 
and powerful. Hands-down the best 
speakers I’ve ever heard on a laptop.
Q
: Of course, CPU readers are going 
to want to know what kind of 
Q
: Hi Lenny! So, tell us about MSI’s 
new GE63VR and GE73VR Raider 
laptops. This is an all-new design, correct? 
LT
: Hey! MSI’s New GE63VR and 
GE73VR Raider laptops are 
absolutely awesome. These newest-
generation GEs feature an all-new 
design with a streamlined racer look, 
and the specs are packed to match. 
The dynamic brushed aluminum alloy 
chassis, new keyboard frame, and 
four-way exhaust gives the Raider a 
premium feel. The bottom side has a 
new MSI dragon and large air inlets to 
keep your laptop cool.
Q
: We were looking over the specs, 
and a few things jumped out at us. 
For starters, can you tell us about the 
new displays in these models? 
LT
: This is one of my favorite 
features of the laptop. The 
GE63VR now comes equipped with a 
120Hz refresh 3ms response time screen 
panel. This panel is great for games 
like CS:GO or Overwatch, where split 
millisecond reactions are needed. You 
can definitely feel a difference from 
traditional monitors when you’re playing 
on this laptop. On top, the panel is 
calibrated to 94% NTSC and has a 
170-degree view angle. 
Q
: What about audio? Looks like 
you have installed speakers by 
Dynaudio? What are the advantages 
of this setup vs. other laptop speakers? 
LT
: The speakers on the Raider is 
unlike anything I’ve ever heard 
86 August2017  /  www.computerpoweruser.com

LT
: They are available now at your 
favorite etailers, and I hope you get 
to enjoy the power of a true gaming laptop 
from MSI! ■
Q
: Thanks for your time, Lenny! 
What else would you like readers 
to know about the GE63VR Raider and 
GE73VR Raider? 
four dedicated heatpipes for the GPU and 
three dedicated for the CPU. The reason 
behind this is to increase its passive cooling 
capability and reduce fan noise. The fan 
doesn’t need to work as hard when its cooler 
has more surface area, and during normal 
light use, I barely hear the fan turn on at all. 
Q
: RGB LED backlight is a big deal 
right now, and it looks like the new 
laptops are set up with that. They have 
SteelSeries keyboards, right? 
LT
: The Raider comes with a brand 
new Per Key RGB SteelSeries 
keyboard. You have ultimate control over 
your keyboard and the backlights. With 
the SteelSeries app, you can customize each 
individual key’s RGB, program Macros, and 
create different profiles for different games. 
Q
: What about storage options? 
LT
: There’s a mix of storage options, 
and so far all of the configurations 
except one come with at least a 512GB SSD 
and at least a 1TB hard drive for storage. 
You can find more on the exact SSD and 
HDD space on our website at us.msi.com.
Q
: The model numbers for these 
laptops both include “VR”; that 
combined with the GPUs suggest that 
they are ready to drive VR gaming? 
LT
: Exactly, we’ve added the VR into 
the model name to help customers 
know that this is a VR-capable laptop, 
which is defined as any that has GeForce 
GTX 1060 or higher graphics.
Q
: What kind of user are these laptops 
designed for? 
LT
: The Raider has all the features of 
a high-end gaming PC, and that’s 
who it’s designed for—those who want 
all the premium features of a gaming PC 
in the form factor of a laptop. The high-
refresh panel is matched with graphics that 
can power it, upgraded speakers that really 
blow you away, and the fastest components 
to keep your laptop futureproof.
