 The point of intersection is (x1, x2) = (9/4, 1/4). 
 5. The system is already in “triangular” form. The fourth equation is x4 = –5, and the other equations do not 
contain the variable x4. The next two steps should be to use the variable x3 in the third equation to 
eliminate that variable from the first two equations. In matrix notation, that means to replace R2 by its 
sum with 3 times R3, and then replace R1 by its sum with –5 times R3. 
 6. One more step will put the system in triangular form. Replace R4 by its sum with –3 times R3, which 
produces

. After that, the next step is to scale the fourth row by –1/5. 
 7. Ordinarily, the next step would be to interchange R3 and R4, to put a 1 in the third row and third column. 
But in this case, the third row of the augmented matrix corresponds to the equation 0 x1 + 0 x2 + 0 x3 = 1, 
or simply, 0 = 1. A system containing this condition has no solution. Further row operations are 
unnecessary once an equation such as 0 = 1 is evident. 
 
 The solution set is empty.

 The solution set contains one solution: (4, 8, 5, 2). 
 10. The system has already been reduced to triangular form. Use the 1 in the fourth row to change the  
–4 and 3 above it to zeros. That is, replace R2 by R2 + (4)R4 and replace R1 by R1 + (–3)R4. For the 
final step, replace R1 by R1 + (2)R2.

 The resulting triangular system indicates that a solution exists. In fact, using the argument from Example 2, 
one can see that the solution is unique. 
16. First replace R4 by R4 + (2)R1 and replace R4 by R4 + (–3/2)R2. (One could also scale R2 before 
adding to R4, but the arithmetic is rather easy keeping R2 unchanged.) Finally, replace R4 by R4 + R3.

 The system is consistent, and using the argument from Example 2, there is only one solution. So the three 
lines have only one point in common.

 The third equation, 0 = –5, shows that the system is inconsistent, so the three planes have no point in 
common.

 Write c for 6 – 3h. If c = 0, that is, if h = 2, then the system has no 
solution, because 0 cannot equal –4. Otherwise, when h ≠ 2, the system has a solution.

 Let b denote the number k + 2g + h. Then the third equation represented by the augmented matrix above 
is 0 = b. This equation is possible if and only if b is zero. So the original system has a solution if and only 
if k + 2g + h = 0.  
26. A basic principle of this section is that row operations do not affect the solution set of a linear system. 
Begin with a simple augmented matrix for which the solution is obviously (–2, 1, 0), and then perform 
any elementary row operations to produce other augmented matrices. Here are three examples. The fact 
that they are all row equivalent proves that they all have the solution set (–2, 1, 0).

 This shows that shows d – 3c must be nonzero, since f and g are arbitrary. Otherwise, for some choices  
of f and g the second row would correspond to an equation of the form 0 = b, where b is nonzero.  
Thus d ≠ 3c. 
28. Row reduce the augmented matrix for the given system. Scale the first row by 1/a, which is possible 
since a is nonzero. Then replace R2 by R2 + (–c)R1.

 The quantity d – c(b/a) must be nonzero, in order for the system to be consistent when the quantity  
g – c( f /a) is nonzero (which can certainly happen). The condition that d – c(b/a) ≠ 0 can also be written 
as ad – bc ≠ 0, or ad ≠ bc. 
29. Swap R1 and R2; swap R1 and R2. 
30. Multiply R2 by –1/2; multiply R2 by –2. 
31. Replace R3 by R3 + (–4)R1; replace R3 by R3 + (4)R1.

 The solution is (20, 27.5, 30, 22.5). 
Notes: The Study Guide includes a “Mathematical Note” about statements, “If … , then … .” 
This early in the course, students typically use single row operations to reduce a matrix. As a result, even 
the small grid for Exercise 34 leads to about 25 multiplications or additions (not counting operations with 
zero). This exercise should give students an appreciation for matrix programs such as MATLAB. Exercise 14 
in Section 1.10 returns to this problem and states the solution in case students have not already solved the 
system of equations. Exercise 31 in Section 2.5 uses this same type of problem in connection with an LU 
factorization. 
For instructors who wish to use technology in the course, the Study Guide provides boxed MATLAB 
notes at the ends of many sections. Parallel notes for Maple, Mathematica, and the TI-83+/86/89 and HP-48G 
calculators appear in separate appendices at the end of the Study Guide. The MATLAB box for Section 1.1 
describes how to access the data that is available for all numerical exercises in the text. This feature has the 
ability to save students time if they regularly have their matrix program at hand when studying linear algebra. 
The MATLAB box also explains the basic commands replace, swap, and scale. These commands are 
included in the text data sets, available from the text web site, www.laylinalgebra.com.

c. When h = 9 and k = 6, the system is consistent and has many solutions. 
 21. a. False. See Theorem 1. 
b. False. See the second paragraph of the section. 
c. True. Basic variables are defined after equation (4). 
d. True. This statement is at the beginning of Parametric Descriptions of Solution Sets. 
e. False. The row shown corresponds to the equation 5x4 = 0, which does not by itself lead to a 
contradiction. So the system might be consistent or it might be inconsistent. 

12 CHAPTER 1 • Linear Equations in Linear Algebra 
 22. a. False. See the statement preceding Theorem 1. Only the reduced echelon form is unique. 
b. False. See the beginning of the subsection Pivot Positions. The pivot positions in a matrix are 
determined completely by the positions of the leading entries in the nonzero rows of any echelon 
form obtained from the matrix. 
c. True. See the paragraph after Example 3. 
d. False. The existence of at least one solution is not related to the presence or absence of free variables. 
If the system is inconsistent, the solution set is empty. See the solution of Practice Problem 2. 
e. True. See the paragraph just before Example 4. 
 23. Yes. The system is consistent because with three pivots, there must be a pivot in the third (bottom) row 
of the coefficient matrix. The reduced echelon form cannot contain a row of the form 
[0   0   0   0   0   1]. 
 24. The system is inconsistent because the pivot in column 5 means that there is a row of the form 
[0   0   0   0   1]. Since the matrix is the augmented matrix for a system, Theorem 2 shows that the system 
has no solution. 
 25. If the coefficient matrix has a pivot position in every row, then there is a pivot position in the bottom 
row, and there is no room for a pivot in the augmented column. So, the system is consistent, by  
Theorem 2. 
 26. Since there are three pivots (one in each row), the augmented matrix must reduce to the form

 No matter what the values of a, b, and c, the solution exists and is unique. 
 27. “If a linear system is consistent, then the solution is unique if and only if every column in the coefficient 
matrix is a pivot column; otherwise there are infinitely many solutions. ”  
 
 This statement is true because the free variables correspond to nonpivot columns of the coefficient 
matrix. The columns are all pivot columns if and only if there are no free variables. And there are no free 
variables if and only if the solution is unique, by Theorem 2. 
 28. Every column in the augmented matrix except the rightmost column is a pivot column, and the rightmost 
column is not a pivot column. 
 29. An underdetermined system always has more variables than equations. There cannot be more basic 
variables than there are equations, so there must be at least one free variable. Such a variable may be 
assigned infinitely many different values. If the system is consistent, each different value of a free 
variable will produce a different solution.

1.2 • Solutions   13 
 
 32. According to the numerical note in Section 1.2, when n = 30 the reduction to echelon form takes about 
2(30)3/3 = 18,000 flops, while further reduction to reduced echelon form needs at most (30)2 = 900 flops. 
Of the total flops, the “backward phase” is about 900/18900 = .048 or about 5%.  
 
  
When n = 300, the estimates are 2(300)3/3 = 18,000,000 phase for the reduction to echelon form and 
(300)2 = 90,000 flops for the backward phase. The fraction associated with the backward phase is about 
(9×104) /(18×106) = .005, or about .5%. 
 33. For a quadratic polynomial p(t) = a0 + a1t + a2t2 to exactly fit the data (1, 12), (2, 15), and (3, 16), the 
coefficients a0, a1, a2 must satisfy the systems of equations given in the text. Row reduce the augmented

 Thus p(t) = 1.7125t – 1.1948t2 + .6615t3 – .0701t4 + .0026t5, and p(7.5) = 64.6 hundred lb. 
Notes: In Exercise 34, if the coefficients are retained to higher accuracy than shown here, then p(7.5) = 64.8. 
If a polynomial of lower degree is used, the resulting system of equations is overdetermined. The augmented 
matrix for such a system is the same as the one used to find p, except that at least column 6 is missing. When 
the augmented matrix is row reduced, the sixth row of the augmented matrix will be entirely zero except for a 
nonzero entry in the augmented column, indicating that no solution exists. 
Exercise 34 requires 25 row operations. It should give students an appreciation for higher-level 
commands such as gauss and bgauss, discussed in Section 1.4 of the Study Guide. The command ref 
(reduced echelon form) is available, but I recommend postponing that command until Chapter 2. 
The Study Guide includes a “Mathematical Note” about the phrase, “If and only if,” used in Theorem 2.

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: The key exercises are 11–14, 17–22, 25, and 26. A discussion of Exercise 25 will help students 
understand the notation [a1   a2   a3], {a1, a2, a3}, and Span{a1, a2, a3}.

 7. See the figure below. Since the grid can be extended in every direction, the figure suggests that every 
vector in R2 can be written as a linear combination of u and v. 
 
 To write a vector a as a linear combination of u and v, imagine walking from the origin to a along the 
grid "streets" and keep track of how many "blocks" you travel in the u-direction and how many in the  
v-direction.  
a. To reach a from the origin, you might travel 1 unit in the u-direction and –2 units in the v-direction 
(that is, 2 units in the negative v-direction). Hence a = u – 2v. 

16 CHAPTER 1 • Linear Equations in Linear Algebra 
b. To reach b from the origin, travel 2 units in the u-direction and –2 units in the v-direction. So  
b = 2u – 2v. Or, use the fact that b is 1 unit in the u-direction from a, so that  
   
b = a + u = (u – 2v) + u = 2u – 2v 
c. The vector c is –1.5 units from b in the v-direction, so 
   
c = b – 1.5v = (2u – 2v) – 1.5v = 2u – 3.5v 
d. The “map” suggests that you can reach d if you travel 3 units in the u-direction and –4 units in the  
v-direction. If you prefer to stay on the paths displayed on the map, you might travel from the origin 
to –3v, then move 3 units in the u-direction, and finally move –1 unit in the v-direction. So 
   
d = –3v + 3u – v = 3u – 4v 
  Another solution is 
   
d = b – 2v + u = (2u – 2v) – 2v + u = 3u – 4v

 8. See the figure above. Since the grid can be extended in every direction, the figure suggests that every 
vector in R2 can be written as a linear combination of u and v. 
w. To reach w from the origin, travel –1 units in the u-direction (that is, 1 unit in the negative  
u-direction) and travel 2 units in the v-direction. Thus, w = (–1)u + 2v, or w = 2v – u. 
x. To reach x from the origin, travel 2 units in the v-direction and –2 units in the u-direction. Thus, 
x = –2u + 2v. Or, use the fact that x is –1 units in the u-direction from w, so that 
   
x = w – u = (–u + 2v) – u = –2u + 2v 
y. The vector y is 1.5 units from x in the v-direction, so 
   
y = x + 1.5v = (–2u + 2v) + 1.5v = –2u + 3.5v 
z. The map suggests that you can reach z if you travel 4 units in the v-direction and –3 units in the 
u-direction. So z = 4v – 3u = –3u + 4v. If you prefer to stay on the paths displayed on the “map,” you 
might travel from the origin to –2u, then 4 units in the v-direction, and finally move –1 unit in  
the u-direction. So  
   
z = –2u + 4v – u = –3u + 4v

 13. Denote the columns of A by a1, a2, a3. To determine if b is a linear combination of these columns, use the 
boxed fact on page 34. Row reduced the augmented matrix until you reach echelon form:

. The vector y is in   
Span{v1, v2} when 7 + 2h is zero, that is, when h = –7/2. 
 19. By inspection, v2 = (3/2)v1. Any linear combination of v1 and v2 is actually just a multiple of v1. For 
instance, 
 
  
av1 + bv2 = av1 + b(3/2)v2 = (a + 3b/2)v1 
 
 So Span{v1, v2} is the set of points on the line through v1 and 0. 
Note: Exercises 19 and 20 prepare the way for ideas in Sections 1.4 and 1.7.  
 20. Span{v1, v2} is a plane in R3 through the origin, because the neither vector in this problem is a multiple 
of the other. Every vector in the set has 0 as its second entry and so lies in the xz-plane in ordinary  
3-space. So Span{v1, v2} is the xz-plane.

u is the zero vector. 
 24. a. True. See the beginning of the subsection Vectors in Rn. 
b. True. Use Fig. 7 to draw the parallelogram determined by u – v and v. 
c. False. See the first paragraph of the subsection Linear Combinations. 
d. True. See the statement that refers to Fig. 11. 
e. True. See the paragraph following the definition of Span{v1, …, vp}.

of Exercise 13.

  Answer: Add 3.5 g at (0, 1), add .5 g at (8, 1), and add 2 g at (2, 4). 
Extra problem: Ignore the mass of the plate, and distribute 6 gm at the three vertices to make the center of 
mass at (2, 2). Answer: Place 3 g at (0, 1), 1 g at (8, 1), and 2 g at (2, 4).  
 32. See the parallelograms drawn on Fig. 15 from the text. Here c1, c2, c3, and c4 are suitable scalars. The 
darker parallelogram shows that b is a linear combination of v1 and v2, that is  
 
  
c1v1 + c2v2 + 0·v3 = b 

22 CHAPTER 1 • Linear Equations in Linear Algebra 
 
 The larger parallelogram shows that b is a linear combination of v1 and v3, that is,  
 
  
c4v1 + 0·v2 + c3v3 = b 
 
 So the equation x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3 = b has at least two solutions, not just one solution. (In fact, the 
equation has infinitely many solutions.)

 33. a. For j = 1,…, n, the jth entry of (u + v) + w is (uj + vj) + wj. By associativity of addition in R, this 
entry equals uj + (vj + wj), which is the jth entry of u + (v + w). By definition of equality of vectors, 
(u + v) + w = u + (v + w). 
b. For any scalar c, the jth entry of c(u + v) is c(uj + vj), and the jth entry of cu + cv is cuj + cvj (by 
definition of scalar multiplication and vector addition). These entries are equal, by a distributive law 
in R. So c(u + v) = cu + cv. 
 34. a. For j = 1,…, n, uj + (–1)uj = (–1)uj + uj = 0, by properties of R. By vector equality, 
   
u + (–1)u = (–1)u + u = 0. 
b. For scalars c and d, the jth entries of c(du) and (cd )u are c(duj) and (cd )uj, respectively. These 
entries in R are equal, so the vectors c(du) and (cd)u are equal. 
Note: When an exercise in this section involves a vector equation, the corresponding technology data (in the 
data files on the web) is usually presented as a set of (column) vectors. To use MATLAB or other technology, 
a student must first construct an augmented matrix from these vectors. The MATLAB note in the Study Guide 
describes how to do this. The appendices in the Study Guide give corresponding information about Maple, 
Mathematica, and the TI and HP calculators.

 Because not every row of B contains a pivot position, Theorem 4 in Section 1.4 shows that the equation 
Bx = y does not have a solution for each y in R4. 
 19. The work in Exercise 17 shows that statement (d) in Theorem 4 is false. So all four statements in 
Theorem 4 are false. Thus, not all vectors in R4 can be written as a linear combination of the columns  
of A. Also, the columns of A do not span R4. 
 20. The work in Exercise 18 shows that statement (d) in Theorem 4 is false. So all four statements in 
Theorem 4 are false. Thus, not all vectors in R4 can be written as a linear combination of the columns  
of B. The columns of B certainly do not span R3, because each column of B is in R4, not R3. (This 
question was asked to alert students to a fairly common misconception among students who are just 
learning about spanning.)  
 21. Row reduce the matrix [v1   v2   v3] to determine whether it has a pivot in each row.

 The matrix [v1   v2   v3] does not have a pivot in each row, so the columns of the matrix do not span R4, 
by Theorem 4. That is, {v1, v2, v3} does not span R4. 
Note: Some students may realize that row operations are not needed, and thereby discover the principle 
covered in Exercises 31 and 32.

 The matrix [v1   v2   v3] has a pivot in each row, so the columns of the matrix span R4, by Theorem 4. 
That is, {v1, v2, v3} spans R4.

b. True. See the box before Example 3. 
c. False. See the warning following Theorem 4.

e. True. See parts (c) and (a) in Theorem 4. 
f. True. In Theorem 4, statement (a) is false if and only if statement (d) is also false. 
 24. a. True. This statement is in Theorem 3. However, the statement is true without any "proof" because, by 
definition, Ax is simply a notation for x1a1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + xnan, where a1, …, an are the columns of A. 
b. True. See Example 2. 
c.  True, by Theorem 3. 
d. True. See the box before Example 2. Saying that b is not in the set spanned by the columns of A is the 
same a saying that b is not a linear combination of the columns of A. 
e. False. See the warning that follows Theorem 4. 
f. True. In Theorem 4, statement (c) is false if and only if statement (a) is also false. 
 25. By definition, the matrix-vector product on the left is a linear combination of the columns of the matrix, 
in this case using weights –3, –1, and 2. So c1 = –3, c2 = –1, and c3 = 2. 
 26. The equation in x1 and x2 involves the vectors u, v, and w, and it may be viewed as

3u – 5v – w = 0 can be rewritten as 3u – 5v = w. So, a solution is x1 = 3, x2 = –5. 
 27. Place the vectors q1, q2, and q3 into the columns of a matrix, say, Q and place the weights x1, x2, and x3 
into a vector, say, x. Then the vector equation becomes

28 CHAPTER 1 • Linear Equations in Linear Algebra 
 29. Start with any 3×3 matrix B in echelon form that has three pivot positions. Perform a row operation  
(a row interchange or a row replacement) that creates a matrix A that is not in echelon form. Then A has 
the desired property. The justification is given by row reducing A to B, in order to display the pivot 
positions. Since A has a pivot position in every row, the columns of A span R3, by Theorem 4. 
 30. Start with any nonzero 3×3 matrix B in echelon form that has fewer than three pivot positions. Perform  
a row operation that creates a matrix A that is not in echelon form. Then A has the desired property. Since 
A does not have a pivot position in every row, the columns of A do not span R3, by Theorem 4. 
 31. A 3×2 matrix has three rows and two columns. With only two columns, A can have at most two pivot 
columns, and so A has at most two pivot positions, which is not enough to fill all three rows. By  
Theorem 4, the equation Ax = b cannot be consistent for all b in R3. Generally, if A is an m×n matrix 
with m > n, then A can have at most n pivot positions, which is not enough to fill all m rows. Thus, the 
equation Ax = b cannot be consistent for all b in R3. 
 32. A set of three vectors in cannot span R4. Reason: the matrix A whose columns are these three vectors has 
four rows. To have a pivot in each row, A would have to have at least four columns (one for each pivot), 
which is not the case. Since A does not have a pivot in every row, its columns do not span R4, by 
Theorem 4. In general, a set of n vectors in Rm cannot span Rm when n is less than m. 
 33. If the equation Ax = b has a unique solution, then the associated system of equations does not have any 
free variables. If every variable is a basic variable, then each column of A is a pivot column. So the 
reduced echelon form of A must be

. 
Note: Exercises 33 and 34 are difficult in the context of this section because the focus in Section 1.4 is on 
existence of solutions, not uniqueness. However, these exercises serve to review ideas from Section 1.2, and 
they anticipate ideas that will come later. 
 34. If the equation Ax = b has a unique solution, then the associated system of equations does not have any 
free variables. If every variable is a basic variable, then each column of A is a pivot column. So the 
reduced echelon form of A must be

. Now it is clear that A has a pivot position in each row. 
By Theorem 4, the columns of A span R3. 
 35. Given Ax1 = y1 and Ax2 = y2, you are asked to show that the equation Ax = w has a solution, where 
w = y1 + y2. Observe that w = Ax1 + Ax2 and use Theorem 5(a) with x1 and x2 in place of u and v, 
respectively. That is, w = Ax1 + Ax2 = A(x1 + x2). So the vector x = x1 + x2 is a solution of w = Ax. 
 36. Suppose that y and z satisfy Ay = z. Then 4z = 4Ay. By Theorem 5(b), 4Ay = A(4y). So 4z = A(4y), 
which shows that 4y is a solution of Ax = 4z. Thus, the equation Ax = 4z is consistent.

 The original matrix has a pivot in every row, so its columns span R4, by Theorem 4. 
 41. [M] Examine the calculations in Exercise 39. Notice that the fourth column of the original matrix, say A, 
is not a pivot column. Let Ao be the matrix formed by deleting column 4 of A, let B be the echelon form 
obtained from A, and let Bo be the matrix obtained by deleting column 4 of B. The sequence of row 
operations that reduces A to B also reduces Ao to Bo. Since Bo is in echelon form, it shows that Ao has a 
pivot position in each row. Therefore, the columns of Ao span R4. 
 
 It is possible to delete column 3 of A instead of column 4. In this case, the fourth column of A becomes a 
pivot column of Ao, as you can see by looking at what happens when column 3 of B is deleted. For later 
work, it is desirable to delete a nonpivot column. 

30 CHAPTER 1 • Linear Equations in Linear Algebra 
Note: Exercises 41 and 42 help to prepare for later work on the column space of a matrix. (See Section 2.9 or 
4.6.) The Study Guide points out that these exercises depend on the following idea, not explicitly mentioned 
in the text: when a row operation is performed on a matrix A, the calculations for each new entry depend only 
on the other entries in the same column. If a column of A is removed, forming a new matrix, the absence of 
this column has no affect on any row-operation calculations for entries in the other columns of A. (The 
absence of a column might affect the particular choice of row operations performed for some purpose, but that 
is not being considered here.) 
 42. [M] Examine the calculations in Exercise 40. The third column of the original matrix, say A, is not a 
pivot column. Let Ao be the matrix formed by deleting column 3 of A, let B be the echelon form obtained 
from A, and let Bo be the matrix obtained by deleting column 3 of B. The sequence of row operations that 
reduces A to B also reduces Ao to Bo. Since Bo is in echelon form, it shows that Ao has a pivot position in 
each row. Therefore, the columns of Ao span R4. 
 
 It is possible to delete column 2 of A instead of column 3. (See the remark for Exercise 41.) However, 
only one column can be deleted. If two or more columns were deleted from A, the resulting matrix would 
have fewer than four columns, so it would have fewer than four pivot positions. In such a case, not every 
row could contain a pivot position, and the columns of the matrix would not span R4, by Theorem 4. 
Notes: At the end of Section 1.4, the Study Guide gives students a method for learning and mastering linear 
algebra concepts. Specific directions are given for constructing a review sheet that connects the basic 
definition of “span” with related ideas: equivalent descriptions, theorems, geometric interpretations, special 
cases, algorithms, and typical computations. I require my students to prepare such a sheet that reflects their 
choices of material connected with “span”, and I make comments on their sheets to help them refine their 
review. Later, the students use these sheets when studying for exams. 
The MATLAB box for Section 1.4 introduces two useful commands gauss and bgauss that allow a 
student to speed up row reduction while still visualizing all the steps involved. The command 
B = gauss(A,1) causes MATLAB to find the left-most nonzero entry in row 1 of matrix A, and use that 
entry as a pivot to create zeros in the entries below, using row replacement operations. The result is a matrix 
that a student might write next to A as the first stage of row reduction, since there is no need to write a new 
matrix after each separate row replacement. I use the gauss command frequently in lectures to obtain an 
echelon form that provides data for solving various problems. For instance, if a matrix has 5 rows, and if row 
swaps are not needed, the following commands produce an echelon form of A: 
 
B = gauss(A,1),  B = gauss(B,2),  B = gauss(B,3),  B = gauss(B,4)  
If an interchange is required, I can insert a command such as B = swap(B,2,5) . The command bgauss 
uses the left-most nonzero entry in a row to produce zeros above that entry. This command, together with 
scale, can change an echelon form into reduced echelon form. 
The use of gauss and bgauss creates an environment in which students use their computer program 
the same way they work a problem by hand on an exam. Unless you are able to conduct your exams in a 
computer laboratory, it may be unwise to give students too early the power to obtain reduced echelon forms 
with one command—they may have difficulty performing row reduction by hand during an exam. Instructors 
whose students use a graphic calculator in class each day do not face this problem. In such a case, you may 
wish to introduce rref earlier in the course than Chapter 4 (or Section 2.8), which is where I finally allow 
students to use that command.  
1.5 
SOLUTIONS  
Notes: The geometry helps students understand Span{u, v}, in preparation for later discussions of subspaces. 
The parametric vector form of a solution set will be used throughout the text. Figure 6 will appear again in 
Sections 2.9 and 4.8.  

1.5 • Solutions   31 
 
For solving homogeneous systems, the text recommends working with the augmented matrix, although no 
calculations take place in the augmented column. See the Study Guide comments on Exercise 7 that illustrate 
two common student errors. 
All students need the practice of Exercises 1–14. (Assign all odd, all even, or a mixture. If you do not 
assign Exercise 7, be sure to assign both 8 and 10.) Otherwise, a few students may be unable later to find a 
basis for a null space or an eigenspace. Exercises 29–34 are important. Exercises 33 and 34 help students later 
understand how solutions of Ax = 0 encode linear dependence relations among the columns of A. Exercises 
35–38 are more challenging. Exercise 37 will help students avoid the standard mistake of forgetting that 
Theorem 6 applies only to a consistent equation Ax = b. 
 1. Reduce the augmented matrix to echelon form and circle the pivot positions. If a column of the 
coefficient matrix is not a pivot column, the corresponding variable is free and the system of equations 
has a nontrivial solution. Otherwise, the system has only the trivial solution.

Note: Exercises 21 and 22 prepare for Exercise 27 in Section 1.8. 
23. a. True. See the first paragraph of the subsection titled Homogeneous Linear Systems. 
b. False. The equation Ax = 0 gives an implicit description of its solution set. See the subsection entitled 
Parametric Vector Form. 
c. False. The equation Ax = 0 always has the trivial solution. The box before Example 1 uses the word 
nontrivial instead of trivial. 
d. False. The line goes through p parallel to v. See the paragraph that precedes Fig. 5. 
e. False. The solution set could be empty! The statement (from Theorem 6) is true only when there 
exists a vector p such that Ap = b. 
24. a. False. A nontrivial solution of Ax = 0 is any nonzero x that satisfies the equation. See the 
 
sentence before Example 2. 
b. True. See Example 2 and the paragraph following it. 

1.5 • Solutions   37 
 
c. True. If the zero vector is a solution, then b = Ax = A0 = 0. 
d. True. See the paragraph following Example 3. 
e. False. The statement is true only when the solution set of Ax = 0 is nonempty. Theorem 6 applies  
only to a consistent system. 
25. Suppose p satisfies Ax = b. Then Ap = b. Theorem 6 says that the solution set of Ax = b equals the  
set S ={w : w = p + vh for some vh such that Avh = 0}. There are two things to prove: (a) every vector  
in S satisfies Ax = b, (b) every vector that satisfies Ax = b is in S. 
a. Let w have the form w = p + vh, where Avh = 0. Then 
   
Aw = A(p + vh) = Ap + Avh. By Theorem 5(a) in section 1.4 
   
     = b + 0 = b 
  So every vector of the form p + vh satisfies Ax = b. 
b. Now let w be any solution of Ax = b, and set vh = w − p. Then 
   
Avh = A(w – p) = Aw – Ap = b – b = 0 
  So vh satisfies Ax = 0. Thus every solution of Ax = b has the form w = p + vh. 
26. (Geometric argument using Theorem 6.) Since Ax = b is consistent, its solution set is obtained by 
translating the solution set of Ax = 0, by Theorem 6. So the solution set of Ax = b is a single vector if  
and only if the solution set of Ax = 0 is a single vector, and that happens if and only if Ax = 0 has only 
the trivial solution. 
 
  
(Proof using free variables.) If Ax = b has a solution, then the solution is unique if and only if there 
are no free variables in the corresponding system of equations, that is, if and only if every column of A is 
a pivot column. This happens if and only if the equation Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution. 
27. When A is the 3×3 zero matrix, every x in R3 satisfies Ax = 0. So the solution set is all vectors in R3. 
28. No. If the solution set of Ax = b contained the origin, then 0 would satisfy A0= b, which is not true 
since b is not the zero vector. 
29. a. When A is a 3×3 matrix with three pivot positions, the equation Ax = 0 has no free variables and 
hence has no nontrivial solution.  
b. With three pivot positions, A has a pivot position in each of its three rows. By Theorem 4 in 
Section 1.4, the equation Ax = b has a solution for every possible b. The term "possible" in the 
exercise means that the only vectors considered in this case are those in R3, because A has three rows. 
30.  a. When A is a 3×3 matrix with two pivot positions, the equation Ax = 0 has two basic variables and 
 
  
one free variable.  So Ax = 0 has a nontrivial solution.   
b. With only two pivot positions, A cannot have a pivot in every row, so by Theorem 4 in Section 1.4, 
the equation Ax = b cannot have a solution for every possible b (in R3). 
31. a. When A is a 3×2 matrix with two pivot positions, each column is a pivot column. So the equation 
  Ax = 0 has no free variables and hence no nontrivial solution. 
b. With two pivot positions and three rows, A cannot have a pivot in every row. So the equation Ax = b 
cannot have a solution for every possible b (in R3), by Theorem 4 in Section 1.4. 
32. a. When A is a 2×4 matrix with two pivot positions, the equation Ax = 0 has two basic variables and 
  two free variables. So Ax = 0 has a nontrivial solution. 
b. With two pivot positions and only two rows, A has a pivot position in every row. By Theorem 4 in 
Section 1.4, the equation Ax = b has a solution for every possible b (in R2).

 and notice that the second column is 3 times the first. So suitable values for 
x1 and x2 would be 3 and –1 respectively. (Another pair would be 6 and –2, etc.) Thus

satisfies Ax = 0.  
34. Inspect how the columns a1 and a2 of A are related. The second column is –3/2 times the first. Put 
another way, 3a1 + 2a2 = 0. Thus 3

 satisfies Ax = 0. 
Note: Exercises 33 and 34 set the stage for the concept of linear dependence. 
35. Look for A = [a1   a2   a3] such that 1·a1 + 1a2 + 1·a3 = 0. That is, construct A so that each row sum (the 
sum of the entries in a row) is zero. 
36. Look for A = [a1   a2   a3] such that 1·a1 – 2·a2 + 1·a3 = 0. That is, construct A so that the sum of the 
first and third columns is twice the second column. 
37. Since the solution set of Ax = 0 contains the point (4,1), the vector x = (4,1) satisfies Ax = 0. Write this 
equation as a vector equation, using a1 and a2 for the columns of A: 
 
  
4·a1 + 1·a2 = 0 
 
 Then a2 = –4a1. So choose any nonzero vector for the first column of A and multiply that column by – 4 
to get the second column of A. For example, set

.  
 
 Finally, the only way the solution set of Ax = b could not be parallel to the line through (1,4) and the 
origin is for the solution set of Ax = b to be empty. This does not contradict Theorem 6, because that 
theorem applies only to the case when the equation Ax = b has a nonempty solution set. For b, take any 
vector that is not a multiple of the columns of A. 
Note: In the Study Guide, a “Checkpoint” for Section 1.5 will help students with Exercise 37. 
38. No. If Ax = y has no solution, then A cannot have a pivot in each row. Since A is 3×3, it has at most two 
pivot positions. So the equation Ax = z for any z has at most two basic variables and at least one free 
variable. Thus, the solution set for Ax = z is either empty or has infinitely many elements. 
39. If u satisfies Ax = 0, then Au = 0. For any scalar c, Theorem 5(b) in Section 1.4 shows that A(cu) =  
cAu = c·0 = 0. 
40. Suppose Au = 0 and Av = 0. Then, since A(u + v) = Au + Av by Theorem 5(a) in Section 1.4, 
 
  
A(u + v) = Au + Av = 0 + 0 = 0.  
 
 Now, let c and d be scalars. Using both parts of Theorem 5,  
 
  
A(cu + dv) = A(cu) + A(dv) = cAu + dAv = c0 + d0 = 0. 
Note: The MATLAB box in the Study Guide introduces the zeros command, in order to augment a matrix 
with a column of zeros.

 The general solution is pG = .875 pS, with pS free. One equilibrium solution is pS = 1000 and pG = 875.  
If one uses fractions instead of decimals in the calculations, the general solution would be written  
pG = (7/8) pS, and a natural choice of prices might be pS = 80 and pG = 70. Only the ratio of the prices 
is important: pG = .875 pS. The economic equilibrium is unaffected by a proportional change in prices. 
 2. Take some other value for pS, say 200 million dollars. The other equilibrium prices are then  
pC = 188 million, pE = 170 million. Any constant nonnegative multiple of these prices is a set of 
equilibrium prices, because the solution set of the system of equations consists of all multiples of one 
vector. Changing the unit of measurement to, say, European euros has the same effect as multiplying 
all equilibrium prices by a constant. The ratios of the prices remain the same, no matter what currency 
is used. 
 3. a. Fill in the exchange table one column at a time. The entries in a column describe where a sector’s

  The general solution is pC = 1.417 pM, pF = .917 pM, with pM free. If pM is assigned the value 100, then 
pC = 141.7 and pF = 91.7. Note that only the ratios of the prices are determined. This makes sense, for 
if the were converted from, say, dollars to yen or Euros, the inputs and outputs of each sector would 
still balance. The economic equilibrium is not affected by a proportional change in prices.

  Scale the first row and solve for the basic variables in terms of the free variable pT, and obtain  
pA = 2.03pT, pE = .53pT, and pM = 1.17pT. The data probably justifies at most two significant figures, 
so take pT = 100 and round off the other prices to pA = 200, pE = 53, and pM = 120.

 The general solution is x1 = x6, x2 = (1.5)x6, x3 = x6, x4 = (2.5)x6, x5 = .5x6, and x6 is free.

 In rational format, the general solution is x1 = (16/327)x7, x2 = (13/327)x7, x3 = (374/327)x7, 
x4 = (16/327)x7, x5 = (26/327)x7, x6 = (130/327)x7, and x7 is free. Take x7 = 327 to make the other 
variables whole numbers. The balanced equation is 
 
 16MnS + 13As2Cr10O35 + 374H2SO4  →  16HMnO4 + 26AsH3 + 130CrS3O12 + 327H2O 

1.6 • Solutions   45 
 
 
 Note that some students may use decimal calculation and simply "round off" the fractions that relate x1, 
..., x6 to x7. The equations they construct may balance most of the elements but miss an atom or two. Here 
is a solution submitted by two of my students: 
 
 5MnS + 4As2Cr10O35 + 115H2SO4  →  5HMnO4 + 8AsH3 + 40CrS3O12 + 100H2O 
 
 Everything balances except the hydrogen. The right side is short 8 hydrogen atoms. Perhaps the students 
thought that the 4H2 (hydrogen gas) escaped!

b. To find minimum flows, note that since x1 cannot be negative, x3 > 40. This implies that 
x2 > 50. Also, since x6 cannot be negative, x4 > 50 and x5 > 60. The minimum flows are 
x2 = 50, x3 = 40, x4 = 50, x5 = 60 (when x1 = 0 and x6 = 0).

 Since x4 cannot be negative, the minimum value of x6 is 70. 
Note: The MATLAB box in the Study Guide discusses rational calculations, needed for balancing the 
chemical equations in Exercises 9 and 10. As usual, the appendices cover this material for Maple, 
Mathematica, and the TI and HP graphic calculators.

SOLUTIONS 
Note: Key exercises are 9–20 and 23–30. Exercise 30 states a result that could be a theorem in the text. There 
is a danger, however, that students will memorize the result without understanding the proof, and then later 
mix up the words row and column. Exercises 37 and 38 anticipate the discussion in Section 1.9 of one-to-one 
transformations. Exercise 44 is fairly difficult for my students. 
 1. Use an augmented matrix to study the solution set of x1u + x2v + x3w = 0 (*), where u, v, and w are the 
three given vectors. Since

, there are no free variables. So the 
homogeneous equation (*) has only the trivial solution. The vectors are linearly independent. 
 3. Use the method of Example 3 (or the box following the example). By comparing entries of the vectors, 
one sees that the second vector is –3 times the first vector. Thus, the two vectors are linearly dependent. 
 4. From the first entries in the vectors, it seems that the second vector of the pair

times the first vector. But there is a sign problem with the second entries. So neither of the vectors is a 
multiple of the other. The vectors are linearly independent. 
 5. Use the method of Example 2. Row reduce the augmented matrix for Ax = 0:

 There are no free variables. The equation Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution and so the columns of A are 
linearly independent.

 There are no free variables. The equation Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution and so the columns of A are 
linearly independent. 
 7. Study the equation Ax = 0. Some people may start with the method of Example 2:

 But this is a waste of time. There are only 3 rows, so there are at most three pivot positions. Hence, at 
least one of the four variables must be free. So the equation Ax = 0 has a nontrivial solution and the 
columns of A are linearly dependent. 
 8. Same situation as with Exercise 7. The (unnecessary) row operations are

 Again, because there are at most three pivot positions yet there are four variables, the equation Ax = 0 
has a nontrivial solution and the columns of A are linearly dependent. 
 9. a. The vector v3 is in Span{v1, v2} if and only if the equation x1v1 + x2v2 = v3 has a solution. To find out, 
row reduce [v1   v2   v3], considered as an augmented matrix:

  At this point, the equation 0 = 8 shows that the original vector equation has no solution. So v3 is in 
Span{v1, v2} for no value of h. 
b. For {v1, v2, v3} to be linearly independent, the equation x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3 = 0 must have only the 
trivial solution. Row reduce the augmented matrix [v1   v2   v3   0]

  For every value of h, x2 is a free variable, and so the homogeneous equation has a nontrivial solution. 
Thus {v1, v2, v3} is a linearly dependent set for all h.

 10. a.  The vector v3 is in Span{v1, v2} if and only if the equation x1v1 + x2v2 = v3 has a solution. To find out,

  At this point, the equation 0 = 1 shows that the original vector equation has no solution. So v3 is in 
Span{v1, v2} for no value of h. 
b. For {v1, v2, v3} to be linearly independent, the equation x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3 = 0 must have only the

  For every value of h, x2 is a free variable, and so the homogeneous equation has a nontrivial solution. 
Thus {v1, v2, v3} is a linearly dependent set for all h.

 The equation x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3 = 0 has a nontrivial solution if and only if h – 6 = 0 (which corresponds to 
x3 being a free variable). Thus, the vectors are linearly dependent if and only if h = 6.

 The equation x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3 = 0 has a nontrivial solution if and only if h + 10 = 0 (which corresponds 
to x3 being a free variable). Thus, the vectors are linearly dependent if and only  
if h = –10. 
 15. The set is linearly dependent, by Theorem 8, because there are four vectors in the set but only two entries 
in each vector. 
 16. The set is linearly dependent because the second vector is 3/2 times the first vector. 
 17. The set is linearly dependent, by Theorem 9, because the list of vectors contains a zero vector. 
 18. The set is linearly dependent, by Theorem 8, because there are four vectors in the set but only two entries 
in each vector. 
 19. The set is linearly independent because neither vector is a multiple of the other vector. [Two of the 
entries in the first vector are – 4 times the corresponding entry in the second vector. But this multiple 
does not work for the third entries.] 
 20. The set is linearly dependent, by Theorem 9, because the list of vectors contains a zero vector. 
 21. a. False. A homogeneous system always has the trivial solution. See the box before Example 2.

 . The columns must linearly independent, by Theorem 7, because the first column is not 
zero, the second column is not a multiple of the first, and the third column is not a linear combination 
of the preceding two columns (because a3 is not in Span{a1, a2}). 
 27. All five columns of the 7×5 matrix A must be pivot columns. Otherwise, the equation Ax = 0 would have 
a free variable, in which case the columns of A would be linearly dependent. 
 28. If the columns of a 5×7 matrix A span R5, then A has a pivot in each row, by Theorem 4. Since each pivot 
position is in a different column, A has five pivot columns. 
 29. A: any 3×2 matrix with two nonzero columns such that neither column is a multiple of the other. In this 
case the columns are linearly independent and so the equation Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution.  
 
 B: any 3×2 matrix with one column a multiple of the other. 
 30. a. n   
b. The columns of A are linearly independent if and only if the equation Ax = 0 has only the trivial 
solution. This happens if and only if Ax = 0 has no free variables, which in turn happens if and only if 
every variable is a basic variable, that is, if and only if every column of A is a pivot column. 
 31. Think of A = [a1   a2   a3]. The text points out that a3 = a1 + a2. Rewrite this as a1 + a2 – a3 = 0. As a 
matrix equation, Ax = 0 for x = (1, 1, –1). 
 32. Think of A = [a1   a2   a3]. The text points out that a1 + 2a2 = a3. Rewrite this as a1 + 2a2 – a3 = 0. As a 
matrix equation, Ax = 0 for x = (1, 2, –1). 
 33. True, by Theorem 7. (The Study Guide adds another justification.) 
 34. True, by Theorem 9. 
 35. False. The vector v1 could be the zero vector. 
 36. False. Counterexample: Take v1, v2, and v4 all to be multiples of one vector. Take v3 to be not a multiple 
of that vector. For example,

 37. True. A linear dependence relation among v1, v2, v3 may be extended to a linear dependence relation 
among v1, v2, v3, v4 by placing a zero weight on v4. 
 38. True. If the equation x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3 = 0 had a nontrivial solution (with at least one of x1, x2, x3 
nonzero), then so would the equation x1v1 + x2v2 + x3v3 + 0⋅v4 = 0. But that cannot happen because 
{v1, v2, v3, v4} is linearly independent. So {v1, v2, v3} must be linearly independent. This problem can 
also be solved using Exercise 37, if you know that the statement there is true. 

1.7 • Solutions   53 
 
 39. If for all b the equation Ax = b has at most one solution, then take b = 0, and conclude that the equation 
Ax = 0 has at most one solution. Then the trivial solution is the only solution, and so the columns of A are 
linearly independent. 
 40. An m×n matrix with n pivot columns has a pivot in each column. So the equation Ax = b has no free 
variables. If there is a solution, it must be unique.

 Actually, any set of three columns of A that includes column 5 will work for B, but the concepts needed 
to prove that are not available now. (Column 5 is not in the two-dimensional subspace spanned by the

 43. [M] Make v any one of the columns of A that is not in B and row reduce the augmented matrix [B   v]. 
The calculations will show that the equation Bx = v is consistent, which means that v is a linear 
combination of the columns of B. Thus, each column of A that is not a column of B is in the set spanned 
by the columns of B. 
 44. [M] Calculations made as for Exercise 43 will show that each column of A that is not a column of B is in 
the set spanned by the columns of B. Reason: The original matrix A has only four pivot columns. If one 
or more columns of A are removed, the resulting matrix will have at most four pivot columns. (Use 
exactly the same row operations on the new matrix that were used to reduce A to echelon form.) If v is a 
column of A that is not in B, then row reduction of the augmented matrix [B   v] will display at most four 
pivot columns. Since B itself was constructed to have four pivot columns, adjoining v cannot produce a 
fifth pivot column. Thus the first four columns of [B   v] are the pivot columns. This implies that the 
equation Bx = v has a solution. 
Note: At the end of Section 1.7, the Study Guide has another note to students about “Mastering Linear 
Algebra Concepts.” The note describes how to organize a review sheet that will help students form a mental 
image of linear independence. The note also lists typical misuses of terminology, in which an adjective is 
applied to an inappropriate noun. (This is a major problem for my students.) I require my students to prepare a 
review sheet as described in the Study Guide, and I try to make helpful comments on their sheets. I am 
convinced, through personal observation and student surveys, that the students who prepare many of these 
review sheets consistently perform better than other students. Hopefully, these students will remember 
important concepts for some time beyond the final exam. 
1.8 
SOLUTIONS 
Notes: The key exercises are 17–20, 25 and 31. Exercise 20 is worth assigning even if you normally assign 
only odd exercises. Exercise 25 (and 27) can be used to make a few comments about computer graphics, even 
if you do not plan to cover Section 2.6. For Exercise 31, the Study Guide encourages students not to look at 
the proof before trying hard to construct it. Then the Guide explains how to create the proof.  
Exercises 19 and 20 provide a natural segue into Section 1.9. I arrange to discuss the homework on these 
exercises when I am ready to begin Section 1.9. The definition of the standard matrix in Section 1.9 follows 
naturally from the homework, and so I’ve covered the first page of Section 1.9 before students realize we are 
working on new material. 
The text does not provide much practice determining whether a transformation is linear, because the time 
needed to develop this skill would have to be taken away from some other topic. If you want your students to 
be able to do this, you may need to supplement Exercises 29, 30, 32 and 33. 
If you skip the concepts of one-to-one and “onto” in Section 1.9, you can use the result of Exercise 31 to 
show that the coordinate mapping from a vector space onto Rn (in Section 4.4) preserves linear independence 
and dependence of sets of vectors. (See Example 6 in Section 4.4.)

56 CHAPTER 1 • Linear Equations in Linear Algebra 
 
 7. a = 5; the domain of T is R5, because a 6×5 matrix has 5 columns and for Ax to be defined, x must be in 
R5. b = 6; the codomain of T is R6, because Ax is a linear combination of the columns of A, and each 
column of A is in R6. 
 8. A must have 5 rows and 4 columns. For the domain of T to be R4, A must have four columns so that Ax is 
defined for x in R4. For the codomain of T to be R5, the columns of A must have five entries (in which 
case A must have five rows), because Ax is a linear combination of the columns of A. 
 9. Solve Ax = 0.

18. Draw a line through w parallel to v, and draw a line through w parallel to u. See the left part of the figure 
below. From this, estimate that w = u + 2v. Since T is linear, T(w) = T(u) + 2T(v). Locate T(u) and 2T(v) 
as in the right part of the figure and form the associated parallelogram to locate T(w).

 24. Given any x in Rn, there are constants c1, …, cp such that x = c1v1 + ··· cpvp, because v1, …, vp span Rn. 
Then, from property (5) of a linear transformation, 
 
  
T(x) = c1T(v1) + ··· + cpT(vp) = c10 + ·· + cp0 = 0 
 25. Any point x on the line through p in the direction of v satisfies the parametric equation  
 
 x = p + tv for some value of t. By linearity, the image T(x) satisfies the parametric equation  
 
  
T(x) = T(p + tv) = T(p) + tT(v) 
 
(*) 
 
 If T(v) = 0, then T(x) = T(p) for all values of t, and the image of the original line is just a single point. 
Otherwise, (*) is the parametric equation of a line through T(p) in the direction of T(v). 
 26. Any point x on the plane P satisfies the parametric equation x = su + tv for some values of s and t.  
By linearity, the image T(x) satisfies the parametric equation 
 
  
T(x) = sT(u) + tT(v) 
(s, t in R) 
 
(*) 
 
 The set of images is just Span{T(u), T(v)}. If T(u) and T(v) are linearly independent, Span{T(u), T(v)} is 
a plane through T(u), T(v), and 0. If T(u) and T(v) are linearly dependent and not both zero, then 
Span{T(u), T(v)} is a line through 0. If T(u) = T(v) = 0, then Span{T(u), T(v)} is {0}.  
 27. a. From Fig. 7 in the exercises for Section 1.5, the line through T(p) and T(q) is in the direction of q – p, 
and so the equation of the line is x = p + t(q – p) = p + tq – tp = (1 – t)p + tq. 
b. Consider x = (1 – t)p + tq for t such that 0 < t < 1. Then, by linearity of T,  
   
T(x) = T((1 – t)p + tq) = (1 – t)T(p) + tT(q)      0 < t < 1 
 
(*) 
  If T(p) and T(q) are distinct, then (*) is the equation for the line segment between T(p) and T(q), as 
shown in part (a) Otherwise, the set of images is just the single point T(p), because 
   
(1 – t)T(p) + tT(q) =(1 – t)T(p) + tT(p) = T(p) 
 28. Consider a point x in the parallelogram determined by u and v, say x = au + bv for 0 < a < 1, 0 < b < 1. 
By linearity of T, the image of x is 
 
  
T(x) = T(au + bv) = aT(u) + bT(v), for 0 < a < 1, 0 < b < 1 
 
(*) 
 
 This image point lies in the parallelogram determined by T(u) and T(v).  
 
 Special “degenerate” cases arise when T(u) and T(v) are linearly dependent. If one of the images is not 
zero, then the “parallelogram” is actually the line segment from 0 to T(u) + T(v). If both T(u) and T(v) 
are zero, then the parallelogram is just {0}. Another possibility is that even u and v are linearly 
dependent, in which case the original parallelogram is degenerate (either a line segment or the zero 
vector). In this case, the set of images must be degenerate, too. 
 29. a. When b = 0, f (x) = mx. In this case, for all x,y in R and all scalars c and d, 
   
f (cx + dy) = m(cx + dy) = mcx + mdy = c(mx) + d(my) = c·f (x) + d·f (y) 
  This shows that f is linear. 

60 CHAPTER 1 • Linear Equations in Linear Algebra 
 
b. When f (x) = mx + b, with b nonzero, f(0) = m(0) = b = b ≠ 0. This shows that f is not linear, because 
every linear transformation maps the zero vector in its domain into the zero vector in the codomain. 
(In this case, both zero vectors are just the number 0.) Another argument, for instance, would be to 
calculate f (2x) = m(2x) + b and 2f (x) = 2mx + 2b. If b is nonzero, then f (2x) is not equal to 2f (x) and 
so f is not a linear transformation. 
c. In calculus, f is called a “linear function” because the graph of f is a line. 
 30. Let T(x) = Ax + b for x in Rn. If b is not zero, T(0) = A0 + b = b ≠ 0. Actually, T fails both properties  
of a linear transformation. For instance, T(2x) = A(2x) + b = 2Ax + b, which is not the same as 2T(x) = 
2(Ax + b) = 2Ax + 2b. Also,  
 
  
T(x + y) = A(x + y) + b = Ax + Ay + b 
 
 which is not the same as 
 
  
T(x) + T(y) = Ax + b + Ay + b 
 31. (The Study Guide has a more detailed discussion of the proof.) Suppose that {v1, v2, v3} is linearly 
dependent. Then there exist scalars c1, c2, c3, not all zero, such that 
 
  
c1v1 + c2v2 + c3v3 = 0 
 
 Then T(c1v1 + c2v2 + c3v3) = T(0) = 0. Since T is linear, 
 
  
c1T(v1) + c2T(v2) + c3T(v3) = 0 
 
 Since not all the weights are zero, {T(v1), T(v2), T(v3)} is a linearly dependent set. 
 32. Take any vector (x1, x2) with x2 ≠ 0, and use a negative scalar. For instance, T(0, 1) = (–2, 3), but 
T(–1·(0, 1)) = T(0, –1) = (2, 3) ≠ (–1)·T(0, 1). 
 33. One possibility is to show that T does not map the zero vector into the zero vector, something that every 
linear transformation does do. T(0, 0) = (0, 4, 0). 
 34. Suppose that {u, v} is a linearly independent set in Rn and yet T(u) and T(v) are linearly dependent. Then 
there exist weights c1, c2, not both zero, such that  
 
 c1T(u) + c2T(v) = 0  
 
 Because T is linear, T(c1u + c2v) = 0. That is, the vector x = c1u + c2v satisfies T(x) = 0. Furthermore, 
x cannot be the zero vector, since that would mean that a nontrivial linear combination of u and v is zero, 
which is impossible because u and v are linearly independent. Thus, the equation T(x) = 0 has a 
nontrivial solution. 
 35. Take u and v in R3 and let c and d be scalars. Then 
 
 cu + dv = (cu1 + dv1, cu2 + dv2, cu3 + dv3). The transformation T is linear because 
 
 T(cu + dv) = (cu1 + dv1, cu2 + dv2, – (cu3 + dv3)) = (cu1 + dv1, cu2 + dv2,  cu3  dv3) 
 
  
= (cu1, cu2,   cu3) + (dv1, dv2,  dv3) = c(u1, u2,     u3) + d(v1, v2,   v3) 
 
  
= cT(u) + dT(v) 
 36. Take u and v in R3 and let c and d be scalars. Then 
 
 cu + dv = (cu1 + dv1, cu2 + dv2, cu3 + dv3). The transformation T is linear because 
 
 T(cu + dv) = (cu1 + dv1, 0, cu3 + dv3) = (cu1, 0, cu3) + (dv1, 0, dv3)  
 
  
= c(u1, 0, u3) + d(v1, 0, v3) 
 
  
= cT(u) + dT(v)

Notes: At the end of Section 1.8, the Study Guide provides a list of equations, figures, examples,  
and connections with concepts that will strengthen a student’s understanding of linear transformations.  
I encourage my students to continue the construction of review sheets similar to those for “span” and “linear 
independence,” but I refrain from collecting these sheets. At some point the students have to assume the 
responsibility for mastering this material. 
If your students are using MATLAB or another matrix program, you might insert the definition of matrix 
multiplication after this section, and then assign a project that uses random matrices to explore properties of 
matrix multiplication. See Exercises 34–36 in Section 2.1. Meanwhile, in class you can continue with your 
plans for finishing Chapter 1. When you get to Section 2.1, you won’t have much to do. The Study Guide’s 
MATLAB note for Section 2.1 contains the matrix notation students will need for a project on matrix 
multiplication. The appendices in the Study Guide have the corresponding material for Mathematica, Maple, 
and the T-83+/86/89 and HP-48G graphic calculators. 

62 CHAPTER 1 • Linear Equations in Linear Algebra 
 
1.9 
SOLUTIONS 
Notes: This section is optional if you plan to treat linear transformations only lightly, but many instructors 
will want to cover at least Theorem 10 and a few geometric examples. Exercises 15 and 16 illustrate a fast 
way to solve Exercises 17–22 without explicitly computing the images of the standard basis. 
The purpose of introducing one-to-one and onto is to prepare for the term isomorphism (in Section 4.4) 
and to acquaint math majors with these terms. Mastery of these concepts would require a substantial 
digression, and some instructors prefer to omit these topics (and Exercises 25–40). In this case, you can use 
the result of Exercise 31 in Section 1.8 to show that the coordinate mapping from a vector space onto Rn (in 
Section 4.4) preserves linear independence and dependence of sets of vectors. (See Example 6 in Section 4.4.) 
The notions of one-to-one and onto appear in the Invertible Matrix Theorem (Section 2.3), but can be omitted 
there if desired 
Exercises 25–28 and 31–36 offer fairly easy writing practice. Exercises 31, 32, and 35 provide important 
links to earlier material.

 7. Follow what happens to e1 and e2. Since e1 is on the unit

 9. The horizontal shear maps e1 into e1, and then the reflection in the line x2 = –x1 maps e1 into –e2.   
(See Table 1.) The horizontal shear maps e2 into e2 into e2 – 2e1. To find the image of e2 – 2e1 when it is 
reflected in the line x2 = –x1, use the fact that such a reflection is a linear transformation. So, the image of 
e2 – 2e1 is the same linear combination of the images of e2 and e1, namely, –e1 – 2(–e2) = – e1 + 2e2.

. This matrix shows that A has only three pivot positions, so the equation Ax = 0 has a 
nontrivial solution. By Theorem 11, the transformation T is not one-to-one. Also, since A does not have a 
pivot in each row, the columns of A do not span R4. By Theorem 12, T does not map R4 onto R4. 
26. The standard matrix A of the transformation T in Exercise 2 is 2×3. Its columns are linearly dependent 
because A has more columns than rows. So T is not one-to-one, by Theorem 12. Also, A is row

28. The standard matrix A of the transformation T in Exercise 14 has linearly independent columns, because 
the figure in that exercise shows that a1 and a2 are not multiples. So T is one-to-one, by Theorem 12. 
Also, A must have a pivot in each column because the equation Ax = 0 has no free variables. Thus, the 
echelon form of A is 
*
0
.



  Since A has a pivot in each row, the columns of A span R2. So T maps R2 
onto R2. An alternate argument for the second part is to observe directly from the figure in Exercise 14 
that a1 and a2 span R2. This is more or less evident, based on experience with grids such as those in 
Figure 8 and Exercise 7 of Section 1.3. 
29. By Theorem 12, the columns of the standard matrix A must be linearly independent and hence the 
equation Ax = 0 has no free variables. So each column of A must be a pivot column:

Note that T cannot be onto because of the shape of A. 
30. By Theorem 12, the columns of the standard matrix A must span R3. By Theorem 4, the matrix must 
have a pivot in each row. There are four possibilities for the echelon form:

 Note that T cannot be one-to-one because of the shape of A. 
31. “T is one-to-one if and only if A has n pivot columns.” By Theorem 12(b), T is one-to-one if and only if 
the columns of A are linearly independent. And from the statement in Exercise 30 in Section 1.7, the 
columns of A are linearly independent if and only if A has n pivot columns. 
32. The transformation T maps Rn onto Rm if and only if the columns of A span Rm, by Theorem 12. This 
happens if and only if A has a pivot position in each row, by Theorem 4 in Section 1.4. Since A has  
m rows, this happens if and only if A has m pivot columns. Thus, “T maps Rn onto Rm if and only A has 
m pivot columns.” 
33. Define 
:
n
m
T
→
R
R  by T(x) = Bx for some m×n matrix B, and let A be the standard matrix for T.  
By definition, A = [T(e1)   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅   T(en)], where ej is the jth column of In. However, by matrix-vector 
multiplication, T(ej) = Bej = bj, the jth column of B. So A = [b1   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅   bn] = B. 
34. The transformation T maps Rn onto Rm if and only if for each y in Rm there exists an x in Rn such that  
y = T(x). 
35. If 
:
n
m
T
→
R
R  maps 
n
R  onto 
m
R , then its standard matrix A has a pivot in each row, by Theorem 12 
and by Theorem 4 in Section 1.4. So A must have at least as many columns as rows. That is, m < n. When 
T is one-to-one, A must have a pivot in each column, by Theorem 12, so m > n. 
36. Take u and v in Rp and let c and d be scalars. Then 
 
 T(S(cu + dv)) = T(c⋅S(u) + d⋅S(v)) 
because S is linear 
 
  
 
 = c⋅T(S(u)) + d⋅T(S(v)) 
because T is linear 
 
 This calculation shows that the mapping x → T(S(x)) is linear. See equation (4) in Section 1.8.

no mixture of the two cereals that will supply exactly the desired list of nutrients. However, one could 
tentatively ignore the final equation and see what the other equations prescribe. They reduce 
to u1 = .25 and u2 = .75. What does the corresponding mixture provide?

  The error of 5% for fat might be acceptable for practical purposes. Actually, the data in COB and Crp 
are certainly not precise and may have some errors even greater than 5%.

  The “solution” is x1 = .64, x2 = .54, x3 = –.09, x4 = –.21. This solution is not feasible, because the 
mixture cannot include negative amounts of whey and isolated soy protein. Although the coefficients 
of these two ingredients are fairly small, they cannot be ignored. The mixture of .64 units of nonfat 
milk and .54 units of soy flour provide 50.6 g of protein, 51.6 g of carbohydrate, 3.8 g of fat, and .9 g 
of calcium. Some of these nutrients are nowhere close to the desired amounts. 
 4. Let x1, x2, and x3 be the number of units of foods 1, 2, and 3, respectively, needed for a meal. The values 
of x1, x2, and x3 should satisfy

 Notice that each off-diagonal entry of R is negative (or zero). This happens because the loop current 
directions are all chosen in the same direction on the figure. (For each loop j, this choice forces the 
currents in other loops adjacent to loop j to flow in the direction opposite to current Ij.)

 9. The population movement problems in this section assume that the total population is constant, with no 
migration or immigration. The statement that “about 5% of the city’s population moves to the suburbs” 
means also that the rest of the city’s population (95%) remain in the city. This determines the entries in 
the first column of the migration matrix (which concerns movement from the city).

population for the year 2000, assuming that the migration rates remain constant and there are no 
deaths, births, or migration. Here are some of the vectors in the calculation, with only the first 4 or 5

a. Here are the solution temperatures for the three problems studied:

Figure for Exercises 34 in Section 1.1 
(20, 27.5, 30, 22.5) 
  When the solutions are arranged this way, it is evident that the third solution is the sum of the first 
two solutions. What might not be so evident is that list of boundary temperatures of the third problem 
is the sum of the lists of boundary temperatures of the first two problems. (The temperatures are listed 
clockwise, starting at the left of T1.)

(  0, 20, 20,   0,   0, 20, 20,   0)

(10, 20, 20, 40, 40, 30, 30, 10) 
b. When the boundary temperatures in Fig. (a) are multiplied by 3, the new interior temperatures are 
also multiplied by 3. 
c. The correspondence from the list of eight boundary temperatures to the list of four interior temper-
atures is a linear transformation. A verification of this statement is not expected. However, it can be 
shown that the solutions of the steady-state temperature problem here satisfy a superposition 
principle. The system of equations that approximate the interior temperatures can be written in the 
form Ax = b, where A is determined by the arrangement of the four interior points on the plate and b 
is a vector in R4 determined by the boundary temperatures.  
Note: The MATLAB box in the Study Guide for Section 1.10 discusses scientific notation and shows how 
to generate a matrix whose columns list the vectors x0, x1, x2, …, determined by an equation xk+1 = Mxk for 
k = 0 , 1, ….

  The matrix A is row equivalent to matrices B and C, both in echelon form. 

Chapter 1 • Supplementary Exercises   77 
 
b. False. Counterexample: Let A be any n×n matrix with fewer than n pivot columns. Then the equation 
Ax = 0 has infinitely many solutions. (Theorem 2 in Section 1.2 says that a system has either zero, 
one, or infinitely many solutions, but it does not say that a system with infinitely many solutions 
exists. Some counterexample is needed.) 
c. True. If a linear system has more than one solution, it is a consistent system and has a free variable. 
By the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem in Section 1.2, the system has infinitely many solutions. 
d. False. Counterexample: The following system has no free variables and no solution:

e. True. See the box after the definition of elementary row operations, in Section 1.1. If [A   b] is 
transformed into [C   d] by elementary row operations, then the two augmented matrices are row 
equivalent. 
f. True. Theorem 6 in Section 1.5 essentially says that when Ax = b is consistent, the solution sets of the 
nonhomogeneous equation and the homogeneous equation are translates of each other. In this case, 
the two equations have the same number of solutions. 
g. False. For the columns of A to span Rm, the equation Ax = b must be consistent for all b in Rm, not for 
just one vector b in Rm. 
h. False. Any matrix can be transformed by elementary row operations into reduced echelon form, but 
not every matrix equation Ax = b is consistent. 
i. True. If A is row equivalent to B, then A can be transformed by elementary row operations first into B 
and then further transformed into the reduced echelon form U of B. Since the reduced echelon form of 
A is unique, it must be U. 
j. False. Every equation Ax = 0 has the trivial solution whether or not some variables are free. 
k. True, by Theorem 4 in Section 1.4. If the equation Ax = b is consistent for every b in Rm, then A must 
have a position in every one of its m rows. If A has m pivot positions, then A has m pivot columns, 
each containing one pivot position. 
l. False. The word “unique” should be deleted. Let A be any matrix with m pivot columns but more than 
m columns altogether. Then the equation Ax = b is consistent and has m basic variables and at least 
one free variable. Thus the equation does not does not have a unique solution. 
m. True. If A has n pivot positions, it has a pivot in each of its n columns and in each of its n rows. The 
reduced echelon form has a 1 in each pivot position, so the reduced echelon form is the n×n identity 
matrix.  
n. True. Both matrices A and B can be row reduced to the 3×3 identity matrix, as discussed in the 
previous question. Since the row operations that transform B into I3 are reversible, A can be 
transformed first into I3 and then into B. 
o. True. The reason is essentially the same as that given for question f. 
p. True. If the columns of A span Rm, then the reduced echelon form of A is a matrix U with a pivot in 
each row, by Theorem 4 in Section 1.4. Since B is row equivalent to A, B can be transformed by row 
operations first into A and then further transformed into U. Since U has a pivot in each row, so does 
B. By Theorem 4, the columns of B span Rm. 
q. False. See Example 5 in Section 1.6. 
r. True. Any set of three vectors in R2 would have to be linearly dependent, by Theorem 8 in

s. False. If a set {v1, v2, v3, v4} were to span R5, then the matrix A = [v1   v2   v3   v4] would have 
a pivot position in each of its five rows, which is impossible since A has only four columns. 
t. True. The vector –u is a linear combination of u and v, namely, –u = (–1)u + 0v. 
u. False. If u and v are multiples, then Span{u, v} is a line, and w need not be on that line. 
v. False. Let u and v be any linearly independent pair of vectors and let w = 2v. Then w = 0u + 2v, so w 
is a linear combination of u and v. However, u cannot be a linear combination of v and w because if it 
were, u would be a multiple of v. That is not possible since {u, v} is linearly independent. 
w. False. The statement would be true if the condition v1 is not zero were present. See Theorem 7 in 
Section 1.7. However, if v1 = 0, then {v1, v2, v3} is linearly dependent, no matter what else might be 
true about v2 and v3. 
x. True. “Function” is another word used for “transformation” (as mentioned in the definition of 
“transformation” in Section 1.8), and a linear transformation is a special type of transformation. 
y. True. For the transformation x 6 Ax to map R5 onto R6, the matrix A would have to have a pivot in 
every row and hence have six pivot columns. This is impossible because A has only five columns. 
z. False. For the transformation x 6 Ax to be one-to-one, A must have a pivot in each column. Since 
A has n columns and m pivots, m might be less than n.  
 2. If a ≠ 0, then x = b/a; the solution is unique. If a = 0, and b ≠ 0, the solution set is empty, because  
0x = 0 ≠ b. If a = 0 and b = 0, the equation 0x = 0 has infinitely many solutions.

 12. A solution set is a plane where there are two free variables. If the coefficient matrix is 2×3, then only one 
column can be a pivot column. The echelon form will have all zeros in the second row. Use a row

 The equation (*) has a nontrivial solution only when (2 – a)(1 + a) = 0. So the vectors are linearly 
independent for all a except a = 2 and a = –1. 
 15. a. If the three vectors are linearly independent, then a, c, and f must all be nonzero. (The converse is 
true, too.) Let A be the matrix whose columns are the three linearly independent vectors. Then 

Chapter 1 • Supplementary Exercises   81 
 
A must have three pivot columns. (See Exercise 30 in Section 1.7, or realize that the equation Ax = 0 
has only the trivial solution and so there can be no free variables in the system of equations.) Since 
A is 3×3, the pivot positions are exactly where a, c, and f are located. 
b. The numbers a, …, f can have any values. Here's why. Denote the columns by v1, v2, and v3. Observe 
that v1 is not the zero vector. Next, v2 is not a multiple of v1 because the third entry of v2 is nonzero. 
Finally, v3 is not a linear combination of v1 and v2 because the fourth entry of v3 is nonzero. By 
Theorem 7 in Section 1.7, {v1, v2, v3} is linearly independent. 
 16. Denote the columns from right to left by v1, …, v4. The “first” vector v1 is nonzero, v2 is not a multiple of 
v1 (because the third entry of v2 is nonzero), and v3 is not a linear combination of v1 and v2 (because the 
second entry of v3 is nonzero). Finally, by looking at first entries in the vectors, v4 cannot be a linear 
combination of v1, v2, and v3. By Theorem 7 in Section 1.7, the columns are linearly independent. 
 17. Here are two arguments. The first is a “direct” proof. The second is called a “proof by contradiction.” 
i. Since {v1, v2, v3} is a linearly independent set, v1 ≠0. Also, Theorem 7 shows that v2 cannot be a 
multiple of v1, and v3 cannot be a linear combination of v1 and v2. By hypothesis, v4 is not a linear 
combination of v1, v2, and v3. Thus, by Theorem 7, {v1, v2, v3, v4} cannot be a linearly dependent set 
and so must be linearly independent. 
ii. Suppose that {v1, v2, v3, v4} is linearly dependent. Then by Theorem 7, one of the vectors in the set is 
a linear combination of the preceding vectors. This vector cannot be v4 because v4 is not in Span{v1, 
v2, v3}. Also, none of the vectors in {v1, v2, v3} is a linear combinations of the preceding vectors, by 
Theorem 7. So the linear dependence of {v1, v2, v3, v4} is impossible. Thus {v1, v2, v3, v4} is linearly 
independent. 
 18. Suppose that c1 and c2 are constants such that  
 
  
c1v1 + c2(v1 + v2) = 0      (*) 
 
 Then (c1 + c2)v1 + c2v2 = 0. Since v1 and v2 are linearly independent, both c1 + c2 = 0 and c2 = 0. It 
follows that both c1 and c2 in (*) must be zero, which shows that {v1, v1 + v2} is linearly independent. 
 19. Let M be the line through the origin that is parallel to the line through v1, v2, and v3. Then v2 – v1 and  
v3 – v1 are both on M. So one of these two vectors is a multiple of the other, say v2 – v1 = k(v3 – v1). This 
equation produces a linear dependence relation (k – 1)v1 + v2 – kv3 = 0. 
 
 A second solution: A parametric equation of the line is x = v1 + t(v2 – v1). Since v3 is on the line, there is 
some t0 such that v3 = v1 + t0(v2 – v1) = (1 – t0)v1 + t0v2. So v3 is a linear combination of v1 and v2, and 
{v1, v2, v3} is linearly dependent. 
 20. If T(u) = v, then since T is linear, 
 
  
T(–u) = T((–1)u) = (–1)T(u) = –v. 
 21. Either compute T(e1), T(e2), and T(e3) to make the columns of A, or write the vectors vertically in the 
definition of T and fill in the entries of A by inspection:

 22. By Theorem 12 in Section 1.9, the columns of A span R3. By Theorem 4 in Section 1.4, A has a pivot in 
each of its three rows. Since A has three columns, each column must be a pivot column. So the equation 

82 CHAPTER 1 • Linear Equations in Linear Algebra 
 
Ax = 0 has no free variables, and the columns of A are linearly independent. By Theorem 12 in Section 
1.9, the transformation x 6 Ax is one-to-one.

  However, the only feasible solutions must have whole numbers of floors for each plan. Thus, x3 must 
be a multiple of 8, to avoid fractions. One solution, for x3 = 0, is to use 2 floors of plan A and 15 
floors of plan B. Another solution, for x3 = 8, is to use 6 floors of plan A , 2 floors of plan B, and 8 
floors of plan C. These are the only feasible solutions. A larger positive multiple of 8 for x3 makes x2 
negative. A negative value for x3, of course, is not feasible either.

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: The definition here of a matrix product AB gives the proper view of AB for nearly all matrix 
calculations. (The dual fact about the rows of A and the rows of AB is seldom needed, mainly because vectors 
here are usually written as columns.) I assign Exercise 13 and most of Exercises 17–22 to reinforce the 
definition of AB. 
Exercises 23 and 24 are used in the proof of the Invertible Matrix Theorem, in Section 2.3. Exercises  
23–25 are mentioned in a footnote in Section 2.2. A class discussion of the solutions of Exercises 23–25 can 
provide a transition to Section 2.2. Or, these exercises could be assigned after starting Section 2.2. 
Exercises 27 and 28 are optional, but they are mentioned in Example 4 of Section 2.4. Outer products also 
appear in Exercises 31–34 of Section 4.6 and in the spectral decomposition of a symmetric matrix, in Section 7.1. 
Exercises 29–33 provide good training for mathematics majors.

 7. Since A has 3 columns, B must match with 3 rows. Otherwise, AB is undefined. Since AB has 7 columns, 
so does B. Thus, B is 3×7. 
 8. The number of rows of B matches the number of rows of BC, so B has 3 rows.

 Right-multiplication (that is, multiplication on the right) by the diagonal matrix D multiplies each column 
of A by the corresponding diagonal entry of D. Left-multiplication by D multiplies each row of A by the 
corresponding diagonal entry of D. To make AB = BA, one can take B to be a multiple of I3. For instance, 
if B = 4I3, then AB and BA are both the same as 4A. 
 12. Consider B = [b1   b2]. To make AB = 0, one needs Ab1 = 0 and Ab2 = 0. By inspection of A, a suitable 
 b1 is 2 ,

 13. Use the definition of AB written in reverse order: [Ab1  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  Abp] = A[b1  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  bp]. Thus  
 
  
[Qr1  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  Qrp] = QR, when R = [r1  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  rp]. 
 14. By definition, UQ = U[q1  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  q4] = [Uq1  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  Uq4]. From Example 6 of Section 1.8, the vector 
Uq1 lists the total costs (material, labor, and overhead) corresponding to the amounts of products B and 
C specified in the vector q1. That is, the first column of UQ lists the total costs for materials, labor, and 
overhead used to manufacture products B and C during the first quarter of the year. Columns 2, 3, 
and 4 of UQ list the total amounts spent to manufacture B and C during the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters, 
respectively. 
 15. a. False. See the definition of AB. 
b. False. The roles of A and B should be reversed in the second half of the statement. See the box after 
Example 3. 
c. True. See Theorem 2(b), read right to left. 
d. True. See Theorem 3(b), read right to left. 
e. False. The phrase “in the same order” should be “in the reverse order.” See the box after Theorem 3. 
 16. a. False. AB must be a 3×3 matrix, but the formula for AB implies that it is 3×1. The plus signs should 
be just spaces (between columns). This is a common mistake. 
b. True. See the box after Example 6. 
c. False. The left-to-right order of B and C cannot be changed, in general.

d. False. See Theorem 3(d).

Note: An alternative solution of Exercise 17 is to row reduce [A   Ab1   Ab2] with one sequence of row 
operations. This observation can prepare the way for the inversion algorithm in Section 2.2. 
 18. The first two columns of AB are Ab1 and Ab2. They are equal since b1 and b2 are equal. 
 19. (A solution is in the text). Write B = [b1  b2  b3]. By definition, the third column of AB is Ab3. By 
hypothesis, b3 = b1 + b2. So Ab3 = A(b1 + b2) = Ab1 + Ab2, by a property of matrix-vector multiplication. 
Thus, the third column of AB is the sum of the first two columns of AB. 
 20. The second column of AB is also all zeros because Ab2 = A0 = 0. 
 21. Let bp be the last column of B. By hypothesis, the last column of AB is zero. Thus, Abp = 0. However,  
bp is not the zero vector, because B has no column of zeros. Thus, the equation Abp = 0 is a linear 
dependence relation among the columns of A, and so the columns of A are linearly dependent. 
Note: The text answer for Exercise 21 is, “The columns of A are linearly dependent. Why?” The Study Guide 
supplies the argument above, in case a student needs help.  
 22. If the columns of B are linearly dependent, then there exists a nonzero vector x such that Bx = 0. From 
this, A(Bx) = A0 and (AB)x = 0 (by associativity). Since x is nonzero, the columns of AB must be linearly 
dependent. 
 23. If x satisfies Ax = 0, then CAx = C0 = 0 and so Inx = 0 and x = 0. This shows that the equation Ax = 0  
has no free variables. So every variable is a basic variable and every column of A is a pivot column.  
(A variation of this argument could be made using linear independence and Exercise 30 in Section 1.7.) 
Since each pivot is in a different row, A must have at least as many rows as columns.  
 24. Take any b in Rm. By hypothesis, ADb = Imb = b. Rewrite this equation as A(Db) = b. Thus, the  
vector x = Db satisfies Ax = b. This proves that the equation Ax = b has a solution for each b in Rm.  
By Theorem 4 in Section 1.4, A has a pivot position in each row. Since each pivot is in a different 
column, A must have at least as many columns as rows. 
 25. By Exercise 23, the equation CA = In implies that (number of rows in A) > (number of columns), that is,  
m > n. By Exercise 24, the equation AD = Im implies that (number of rows in A) < (number of columns), 
that is, m < n. Thus m = n. To prove the second statement, observe that DAC = (DA)C = InC = C, and 
also DAC = D(AC) = DIm = D. Thus C = D. A shorter calculation is 
 
  
C = InC = (DA)C = D(AC) = DIn = D 
 26. Write I3 =[e1   e2   e3] and D = [d1   d2   d3]. By definition of AD, the equation AD = I3 is equivalent 
|to the three equations Ad1 = e1, Ad2 = e2, and Ad3 = e3. Each of these equations has at least one solution 
because the columns of A span R3. (See Theorem 4 in Section 1.4.) Select one solution of each equation 
and use them for the columns of D. Then AD = I3.

 28. Since the inner product uTv is a real number, it equals its transpose. That is, 
 
 uTv = (uTv)T = vT (uT)T = vTu, by Theorem 3(d) regarding the transpose of a product of matrices and by 
Theorem 3(a). The outer product uvT is an n×n matrix. By Theorem 3, (uvT)T = (vT)TuT = vuT.

ImA = Im[a1   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅   an] = [Ima1   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅   Iman] = [a1   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅   an] = A 
 32. Let ej and aj denote the jth columns of In and A, respectively. By definition, the jth column of AIn is Aej, 
which is simply aj because ej has 1 in the jth position and zeros elsewhere. Thus corresponding columns

 35. [M]  The answer here depends on the choice of matrix program. For MATLAB, use the help 
command to read about zeros, ones, eye, and diag. For other programs see the 
appendices in the Study Guide. (The TI calculators have fewer single commands that produce 
special matrices.) 

88 CHAPTER 2 • Matrix Algebra 
 36. [M]  The answer depends on the choice of matrix program. In MATLAB, the command rand(6,4) 
creates a 6×4 matrix with random entries uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. The command 
   
round(19*(rand(6,4)–.5)) 
 
 creates a random 6×4 matrix with integer entries between –9 and 9. The same result is produced by the 
command randomint in the Laydata Toolbox on text website. For other matrix programs see the 
appendices in the Study Guide.  
 37. [M] (A + I)(A – I) – (A2 – I) = 0 for all 4×4 matrices. However, (A + B)(A – B) – A2 – B2 is the zero 
matrix only in the special cases when AB = BA. In general, 
 
  
(A + B)(A – B) = A(A – B) + B(A – B) = AA – AB + BA – BB. 
 38. [M]  The equality (AB)T = ATBT is very likely to be false for 4×4 matrices selected at random. 
 39. [M]  The matrix S “shifts” the entries in a vector (a, b, c, d, e) to yield (b, c, d, e, 0). The entries in S2 
result from applying S to the columns of S, and similarly for S3, and so on. This explains the patterns 
of entries in the powers of S:

2.2 
SOLUTIONS 
Notes: The text includes the matrix inversion algorithm at the end of the section because this topic is popular. 
Students like it because it is a simple mechanical procedure. However, I no longer cover it in my classes 
because technology is readily available to invert a matrix whenever needed, and class time is better spent on 
more useful topics such as partitioned matrices. The final subsection is independent of the inversion algorithm 
and is needed for Exercises 35 and 36. 
Key Exercises: 8, 11–24, 35. (Actually, Exercise 8 is only helpful for some exercises in this section. 
Section 2.3 has a stronger result.) Exercises 23 and 24 are used in the proof of the Invertible Matrix Theorem 
(IMT) in Section 2.3, along with Exercises 23 and 24 in Section 2.1. I recommend letting students work on 
two or more of these four exercises before proceeding to Section 2.3. In this way students participate in the 

2.2 • Solutions   89 
proof of the IMT rather than simply watch an instructor carry out the proof. Also, this activity will help 
students understand why the theorem is true.

Note: The Study Guide also discusses the number of arithmetic calculations for this Exercise 7, stating that 
when A is large, the method used in (b) is much faster than using A–1. 
 8. Left-multiply each side of the equation AD = I by A–1 to obtain  
 
  
A–1AD = A–1I, ID = A–1, and D = A–1.

, then ab – cd = 1 – 0 ≠ 0, but Theorem 4 shows that this matrix is not invertible, 
because ad – bc = 0. 
d. True. This follows from Theorem 5, which also says that the solution of Ax = b is unique, for each b. 
e. True, by the box just before Example 6. 
10. a. False. The product matrix is invertible, but the product of inverses should be in the reverse order.  
  See Theorem 6(b). 
b. True, by Theorem 6(a). 
c. True, by Theorem 4. 
d. True, by Theorem 7. 
e. False. The last part of Theorem 7 is misstated here. 
11. (The proof can be modeled after the proof of Theorem 5.) The n×p matrix B is given (but is arbitrary). 
Since A is invertible, the matrix A–1B satisfies AX = B, because A(A–1B) = A A–1B = IB = B. To show this 
solution is unique, let X be any solution of AX = B. Then, left-multiplication of each side by A–1 shows 
that X must be A–1B: 
 
  
A–1 (AX) = A–1B,     IX = A–1B,     and     X = A–1B. 
12. If you assign this exercise, consider giving the following Hint: Use elementary matrices and imitate the 
proof of Theorem 7. The solution in the Instructor’s Edition follows this hint. Here is another solution, 
based on the idea at the end of Section 2.2. 
 
 Write B = [b1  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  bp] and X = [u1  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  up]. By definition of matrix multiplication, 
AX = [Au1  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  Aup]. Thus, the equation AX = B is equivalent to the p systems: 
 
  
Au1 = b1,   …  Aup = bp 
 
 Since A is the coefficient matrix in each system, these systems may be solved simultaneously, placing the 
augmented columns of these systems next to A to form [A   b1  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  bp] = [A   B]. Since A is 
invertible, the solutions u1, …, up are uniquely determined, and [A   b1  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  bp] must row reduce to 
[I   u1  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  up] = [I   X]. By Exercise 11, X is the unique solution A–1B of AX = B. 
13. Left-multiply each side of the equation AB = AC by A–1 to obtain 
 
  
A–1AB = A–1AC,     IB = IC,     and     B = C. 
 
 This conclusion does not always follow when A is singular. Exercise 10 of Section 2.1 provides a 
counterexample. 
14. Right-multiply each side of the equation (B – C)D = 0 by D–1 to obtain 
 
  
(B – C)DD–1 = 0D–1,     (B – C)I = 0,     B – C = 0,     and    B = C. 
15. The box following Theorem 6 suggests what the inverse of ABC should be, namely, C–1B–1A–1. To verify 
that this is correct, compute: 
 
  
(ABC) C–1B–1A–1 = ABCC–1B–1A–1 = ABIB–1A–1 = ABB–1A–1 = AIA–1 = AA–1 = I 
 
 and 
 
  
C–1B–1A–1 (ABC) = C–1B–1A–1ABC = C–1B–1IBC = C–1B–1BC = C–1IC = C–1C = I 

2.2 • Solutions   91 
16. Let C = AB. Then CB–1 = ABB–1, so CB–1 = AI = A. This shows that A is the product of invertible 
matrices and hence is invertible, by Theorem 6. 
Note: The Study Guide warns against using the formula (AB) –1 = B–1A–1 here, because this formula can be 
used only when both A and B are already known to be invertible. 
17. Right-multiply each side of AB = BC by B–1:  
 
  
ABB–1 = BCB–1,     AI  = BCB–1,     A = BCB–1. 
18. Left-multiply each side of A = PBP–1 by P–1:  
 
  
P–1A = P–1PBP–1,     P–1A = IBP–1,     P–1A = BP–1 
 
 Then right-multiply each side of the result by P: 
 
  
P–1AP = BP–1P,     P–1AP = BI,     P–1AP = B 
19. Unlike Exercise 17, this exercise asks two things, “Does a solution exist and what is it?” First, find what 
the solution must be, if it exists. That is, suppose X satisfies the equation C–1(A + X)B–1 = I. Left-multiply 
each side by C, and then right-multiply each side by B: 
 
  
CC–1(A + X)B–1 = CI,     I(A + X)B–1 = C,     (A + X)B–1B = CB,     (A + X)I = CB 
 
 Expand the left side and then subtract A from both sides:  
 
  
AI + XI = CB,     A + X = CB,     X = CB – A 
 
 If a solution exists, it must be CB – A. To show that CB – A really is a solution, substitute it for X: 
 
  
C–1[A + (CB – A)]B–1 = C–1[CB]B–1 = C–1CBB–1 = II = I. 
Note: The Study Guide suggests that students ask their instructor about how many details to include in their 
proofs. After some practice with algebra, an expression such as CC–1(A + X)B–1 could be simplified directly to 
(A + X)B–1 without first replacing CC–1 by I. However, you may wish this detail to be included in the 
homework for this section. 
20. a. Left-multiply both sides of (A – AX)–1 = X–1B by X to see that B is invertible because it is the product 
of invertible matrices. 
b. Invert both sides of the original equation and use Theorem 6 about the inverse of a product (which 
applies because X–1 and B are invertible): 
   
A – AX = (X–1B)–1 = B–1(X–1)–1 = B–1X 
  Then A = AX + B–1X = (A + B–1)X. The product (A + B–1)X is invertible because A is invertible. Since 
X is known to be invertible, so is the other factor, A + B–1, by Exercise 16 or by an argument similar 
to part (a). Finally, 
   
(A + B–1)–1A = (A + B–1)–1(A + B–1)X = X 
Note: This exercise is difficult. The algebra is not trivial, and at this point in the course, most students will 
not recognize the need to verify that a matrix is invertible. 
21. Suppose A is invertible. By Theorem 5, the equation Ax = 0 has only one solution, namely, the zero 
solution. This means that the columns of A are linearly independent, by a remark in Section 1.7. 
22. Suppose A is invertible. By Theorem 5, the equation Ax = b has a solution (in fact, a unique solution) for 
each b. By Theorem 4 in Section 1.4, the columns of A span Rn. 
23. Suppose A is n×n and the equation Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution. Then there are no free variables 
in this equation, and so A has n pivot columns. Since A is square and the n pivot positions must be in 
different rows, the pivots in an echelon form of A must be on the main diagonal. Hence A is row 
equivalent to the n×n identity matrix. 

92 CHAPTER 2 • Matrix Algebra 
24. If the equation Ax = b has a solution for each b in Rn, then A has a pivot position in each row, by 
Theorem 4 in Section 1.4. Since A is square, the pivots must be on the diagonal of A. It follows that A is 
row equivalent to In. By Theorem 7, A is invertible.

, because –cb + da = 0. Thus, x2 is a nontrivial solution of Ax = 0. 
So, in all cases, the equation Ax = 0 has more than one solution. This is impossible when A is invertible 
(by Theorem 5), so A is not invertible.

except for the jth row), bj = ej – ej+1 and an = bn = en. 
 
 To show that AB = I, it suffices to show that Abj = ej for each j. For j = 1, …, n – 1, 
 
  
Abj = A(ej – ej+1) = Aej – Aej+1 = aj – aj+1 = ej

 Baj = B(ej + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + en) = bj + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + bn 
 
  
      = (ej – ej+1) + (ej+1 – ej+2) + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + (en–1 – en) + en = ej 
 
 This proves that BA = I. Combined with the first part, this proves that B = A–1.

invertible follows from Exercise 25 in Section 2.1, because A is not square. 
38. Write AD = A[d1   d2] = [Ad1   Ad2]. The structure of A shows that D =

 [There are 25 possibilities for D if entries of D are allowed to be 1, –1, and 0.] There is no 4×2 matrix C 
such that CA = I4. If this were true, then CAx would equal x for all x in R4. This cannot happen because 
the columns of A are linearly dependent and so Ax = 0 for some nonzero vector x. For such an x,  
CAx = C(0) = 0. An alternate justification would be to cite Exercise 23 or 25 in Section 2.1.

 To find the forces (in pounds) required to produce a deflection of .04 cm at point 3, most students will 
use technology to solve Df = (0, 0, .04) and obtain (0, –5, 10).  
 
 Here is another method, based on the idea suggested in Exercise 42. The first column of D–1 lists the 
forces required to produce a deflection of 1 in. at point 1 (with zero deflection at the other points). Since 
the transformation y 6 D–1y is linear, the forces required to produce a deflection of .04 cm at point 3 is 
given by .04 times the third column of D–1, namely (.04)(125) times (0, –1, 2), or (0, –5, 10) pounds. 
41. To determine the forces that produce a deflections of .08, .12, .16, and .12 cm at the four points on the 
beam, use technology to solve Df = y, where y = (.08, .12, .16, .12). The forces at the four points are 12, 
1.5, 21.5, and 12 newtons, respectively. 

96 CHAPTER 2 • Matrix Algebra 
42. [M]  To determine the forces that produce a deflection of .240 cm at the second point on the beam, use 
technology to solve Df = y, where y = (0, .24, 0, 0). The forces at the four points are –104, 167, –113, 
and 56.0 newtons, respectively (to three significant digits). These forces are .24 times the entries in the 
second column of D–1. Reason: The transformation 
1
D−
y
y
6
 is linear, so the forces required to produce 
a deflection of .24 cm at the second point are .24 times the forces required to produce a deflection of 1 
cm at the second point. These forces are listed in the second column of D–1. 
 
 Another possible discussion: The solution of Dx = (0, 1, 0, 0) is the second column of D–1.  
Multiply both sides of this equation by .24 to obtain D(.24x) = (0, .24, 0, 0). So .24x is the solution  
of Df = (0, .24, 0, 0). (The argument uses linearity, but students may not mention this.) 
Note: The Study Guide suggests using gauss, swap, bgauss, and scale to reduce [A    I], because  
I prefer to postpone the use of ref (or rref) until later. If you wish to introduce ref now, see the 
Study Guide’s technology notes for Sections 2.8 or 4.3. (Recall that Sections 2.8 and 2.9 are only covered 
when an instructor plans to skip Chapter 4 and get quickly to eigenvalues.) 
2.3 
SOLUTIONS 
Notes: This section ties together most of the concepts studied thus far. With strong encouragement from an 
instructor, most students can use this opportunity to review and reflect upon what they have learned, and form 
a solid foundation for future work. Students who fail to do this now usually struggle throughout the rest of the 
course. Section 2.3 can be used in at least three different ways.  
(1) Stop after Example 1 and assign exercises only from among the Practice Problems and Exercises 1  
to 28. I do this when teaching “Course 3” described in the text's “Notes to the Instructor. ” If you did not 
cover Theorem 12 in Section 1.9, omit statements (f) and (i) from the Invertible Matrix Theorem. 
(2) Include the subsection “Invertible Linear Transformations” in Section 2.3, if you covered Section 1.9. 
I do this when teaching “Course 1” because our mathematics and computer science majors take this class. 
Exercises 29–40 support this material. 
(3) Skip the linear transformation material here, but discusses the condition number and the Numerical 
Notes. Assign exercises from among 1–28 and 41–45, and perhaps add a computer project on the condition 
number. (See the projects on our web site.) I do this when teaching “Course 2” for our engineers. 
The abbreviation IMT (here and in the Study Guide) denotes the Invertible Matrix Theorem (Theorem 8).

 are not multiples, so they are linearly independent. By (e) in the

not invertible.

 The 5×5 matrix is invertible because it has five pivot positions, by (c) of the IMT. 
11. a. True, by the IMT. If statement (d) of the IMT is true, then so is statement (b). 
b. True. If statement (h) of the IMT is true, then so is statement (e). 
c. False. Statement (g) of the IMT is true only for invertible matrices. 
d. True, by the IMT. If the equation Ax = 0 has a nontrivial solution, then statement (d) of the IMT is 
false. In this case, all the lettered statements in the IMT are false, including statement (c), which 
means that A must have fewer than n pivot positions. 
e. True, by the IMT. If AT is not invertible, then statement (1) of the IMT is false, and hence statement 
(a) must also be false. 
12. a. True. If statement (k) of the IMT is true, then so is statement ( j). 
b. True. If statement (e) of the IMT is true, then so is statement (h). 
c. True. See the remark immediately following the proof of the IMT. 
d. False. The first part of the statement is not part (i) of the IMT. In fact, if A is any n×n matrix, the 
linear transformation 
A
x
x
6
 maps 
n into 
n, yet not every such matrix has n pivot positions. 
e. True, by the IMT. If there is a b in 
n such that the equation Ax = b is inconsistent, then statement (g) 
of the IMT is false, and hence statement (f) is also false. That is, the transformation 
A
x
x
6
 cannot 
be one-to-one. 
Note: The solutions below for Exercises 13–30 refer mostly to the IMT. In many cases, however, part or all 
of an acceptable solution could also be based on various results that were used to establish the IMT. 
13. If a square upper triangular n×n matrix has nonzero diagonal entries, then because it is already in echelon 
form, the matrix is row equivalent to In and hence is invertible, by the IMT. Conversely, if the matrix is 
invertible, it has n pivots on the diagonal and hence the diagonal entries are nonzero. 
14. If A is lower triangular with nonzero entries on the diagonal, then these n diagonal entries can be used as 
pivots to produce zeros below the diagonal. Thus A has n pivots and so is invertible, by the IMT. If one 
of the diagonal entries in A is zero, A will have fewer than n pivots and hence be singular. 
Notes: For Exercise 14, another correct analysis of the case when A has nonzero diagonal entries is to apply 
the IMT (or Exercise 13) to AT. Then use Theorem 6 in Section 2.2 to conclude that since AT is invertible so is 
its transpose, A. You might mention this idea in class, but I recommend that you not spend much time 
discussing AT and problems related to it, in order to keep from making this section too lengthy. (The transpose 
is treated infrequently in the text until Chapter 6.) 
If you do plan to ask a test question that involves AT and the IMT, then you should give the students some 
extra homework that develops skill using AT. For instance, in Exercise 14 replace “columns” by “rows.”  

2.3 • Solutions   99 
Also, you could ask students to explain why an n×n matrix with linearly independent columns must also have 
linearly independent rows. 
15. If A has two identical columns then its columns are linearly dependent. Part (e) of the IMT shows that  
A cannot be invertible. 
16. Part (h) of the IMT shows that a 5×5 matrix cannot be invertible when its columns do not span R5. 
17. If A is invertible, so is A–1, by Theorem 6 in Section 2.2. By (e) of the IMT applied to A–1, the columns of 
A–1 are linearly independent. 
18. By (g) of the IMT, C is invertible. Hence, each equation Cx = v has a unique solution, by Theorem 5 in 
Section 2.2. This fact was pointed out in the paragraph following the proof of the IMT. 
19. By (e) of the IMT, D is invertible. Thus the equation Dx = b has a solution for each b in R7, by (g) of  
the IMT. Even better, the equation Dx = b has a unique solution for each b in R7, by Theorem 5 in 
Section 2.2. (See the paragraph following the proof of the IMT.) 
20. By the box following the IMT, E and F are invertible and are inverses. So FE = I = EF, and so E and F 
commute. 
21. The matrix G cannot be invertible, by Theorem 5 in Section 2.2 or by the box following the IMT. So (h) 
of the IMT is false and the columns of G do not span Rn. 
22. Statement (g) of the IMT is false for H, so statement (d) is false, too. That is, the equation Hx = 0 has a 
nontrivial solution. 
23. Statement (b) of the IMT is false for K, so statements (e) and (h) are also false. That is, the columns of K 
are linearly dependent and the columns do not span Rn. 
24. No conclusion about the columns of L may be drawn, because no information about L has been given. 
The equation Lx = 0 always has the trivial solution. 
25. Suppose that A is square and AB = I. Then A is invertible, by the (k) of the IMT. Left-multiplying each 
side of the equation AB = I by A–1, one has  
 
  
A–1AB = A–1I,     IB = A–1,     and B = A–1. 
 
 By Theorem 6 in Section 2.2, the matrix B (which is A–1) is invertible, and its inverse is (A–1)–1,  
which is A. 
26. If the columns of A are linearly independent, then since A is square, A is invertible, by the IMT. So A2, 
which is the product of invertible matrices, is invertible. By the IMT, the columns of A2 span Rn. 
27. Let W be the inverse of AB. Then ABW = I and A(BW) = I. Since A is square, A is invertible, by (k) of the 
IMT. 
Note: The Study Guide for Exercise 27 emphasizes here that the equation A(BW) = I, by itself, does not show 
that A is invertible. Students are referred to Exercise 38 in Section 2.2 for a counterexample. Although there is 
an overall assumption that matrices in this section are square, I insist that my students mention this fact when 
using the IMT. Even so, at the end of the course, I still sometimes find a student who thinks that an equation 
AB = I implies that A is invertible. 
28. Let W be the inverse of AB. Then WAB = I and (WA)B = I. By (j) of the IMT applied to B in place of A, 
the matrix B is invertible. 

100 CHAPTER 2 • Matrix Algebra 
29. Since the transformation 
A
x
x
6
 is not one-to-one, statement (f) of the IMT is false. Then (i) is also 
false and the transformation 
A
x
x
6
 does not map Rn onto Rn. Also, A is not invertible, which implies 
that the transformation 
A
x
x
6
 is not invertible, by Theorem 9. 
30. Since the transformation 
A
x
x
6
 is one-to-one, statement (f) of the IMT is true. Then (i) is also true and 
the transformation 
A
x
x
6
 maps Rn onto Rn. Also, A is invertible, which implies that the transformation 
A
x
x
6
 is invertible, by Theorem 9. 
31. Since the equation Ax = b has a solution for each b, the matrix A has a pivot in each row (Theorem 4 in 
Section 1.4). Since A is square, A has a pivot in each column, and so there are no free variables in the 
equation Ax = b, which shows that the solution is unique. 
Note: The preceding argument shows that the (square) shape of A plays a crucial role. A less revealing proof 
is to use the “pivot in each row” and the IMT to conclude that A is invertible. Then Theorem 5 in Section 2.2 
shows that the solution of Ax = b is unique. 
32. If Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution, then A must have a pivot in each of its n columns. Since A is 
square (and this is the key point), there must be a pivot in each row of A. By Theorem 4 in Section 1.4, 
the equation Ax = b has a solution for each b in Rn. 
 
  
Another argument: Statement (d) of the IMT is true, so A is invertible. By Theorem 5 in Section 2.2,

35. (Solution in Study Guide) To show that T is one-to-one, suppose that T(u) = T(v) for some vectors u and 
v in Rn. Then S(T(u)) = S(T(v)), where S is the inverse of T. By Equation (1), u = S(T(u)) and S(T(v)) = v, 
so u = v. Thus T is one-to-one. To show that T is onto, suppose y represents an arbitrary vector in Rn and 
define x = S(y). Then, using Equation (2), T(x) = T(S(y)) = y, which shows that T maps Rn onto Rn. 
 
 Second proof: By Theorem 9, the standard matrix A of T is invertible. By the IMT, the columns of A are 
linearly independent and span Rn. By Theorem 12 in Section 1.9, T is one-to-one and maps Rn onto Rn. 
36. If T maps Rn onto Rn, then the columns of its standard matrix A span Rn, by Theorem 12 in Section 1.9. 
By the IMT, A is invertible. Hence, by Theorem 9 in Section 2.3, T is invertible, and A–1 is the standard 
matrix of T–1. Since A–1 is also invertible, by the IMT, its columns are linearly independent and span Rn. 
Applying Theorem 12 in Section 1.9 to the transformation T–1, we conclude that T–1 is a one-to-one 
mapping of Rn onto Rn.

37. Let A and B be the standard matrices of T and U, respectively. Then AB is the standard matrix of the 
mapping 
( ( ))
T U

x

, because of the way matrix multiplication is defined (in Section 2.1). By 
hypothesis, this mapping is the identity mapping, so AB = I. Since A and B are square, they are invertible, 
by the IMT, and B = A–1. Thus, BA = I. This means that the mapping 
( ( ))
U T
x
x
6
is the identity 
mapping, i.e., U(T(x)) = x for all x in Rn. 
38. Let A be the standard matrix of T. By hypothesis, T is not a one-to-one mapping. So, by Theorem 12 in 
Section 1.9, the standard matrix A of T has linearly dependent columns. Since A is square, the columns  
of A do not span Rn. By Theorem 12, again, T cannot map Rn onto Rn.  
39. Given any v in Rn, we may write v = T(x) for some x, because T is an onto mapping. Then, the assumed 
properties of S and U show that S(v) = S(T(x)) = x and U(v) = U(T(x)) = x. So S(v) and U(v) are equal for 
each v. That is, S and U are the same function from Rn into Rn. 
40. Given u, v in 
n, let x = S(u) and y = S(v). Then T(x)=T(S(u)) = u and T(y) = T(S(v)) = v, by  
equation (2). Hence

41. [M]  a. The exact solution of (3) is x1 = 3.94 and x2 = .49. The exact solution of (4) is x1 = 2.90 and  
 
x2 = 2.00. 
b. When the solution of (4) is used as an approximation for the solution in (3) , the error in using the 
value of 2.90 for x1 is about 26%, and the error in using 2.0 for x2 is about 308%. 
c. The condition number of the coefficient matrix is 3363. The percentage change in the solution from 
(3) to (4) is about 7700 times the percentage change in the right side of the equation. This is the same 
order of magnitude as the condition number. The condition number gives a rough measure of how 
sensitive the solution of Ax = b can be to changes in b. Further information about the condition 
number is given at the end of Chapter 6 and in Chapter 7. 
Note: See the Study Guide’s MATLAB box, or a technology appendix, for information on condition number. 
Only the TI-83+ and TI-89 lack a command for this. 
42. [M]  MATLAB gives cond(A) = 23683, which is approximately 104. If you make several trials with 
MATLAB, which records 16 digits accurately, you should find that x and x1 agree to at least 12 or 13 
significant digits. So about 4 significant digits are lost. Here is the result of one experiment. The vectors 
were all computed to the maximum 16 decimal places but are here displayed with only four decimal

places that MATLAB usually computes accurately. That is, one should expect the solution to be accurate 
to only about 11 or 12 decimal places. Here is the result of one experiment. The vectors were all

 Since MATLAB computes 
numbers accurately to 16 decimal places, the entries in the computed value of x should be accurate to at 
least 11 digits. The exact solution is (630, –12600, 56700, –88200, 44100). 
45. [M]  Some versions of MATLAB issue a warning when asked to invert a Hilbert matrix of order 12 or 
larger using floating-point arithmetic. The product AA–1 should have several off-diagonal entries that are 
far from being zero. If not, try a larger matrix. 
Note: All matrix programs supported by the Study Guide have data for Exercise 45, but only MATLAB and 
Maple have a single command to create a Hilbert matrix. The HP-48G data for Exercise 45 contain a program 
that can be edited to create other Hilbert matrices. 
Notes: The Study Guide for Section 2.3 organizes the statements of the Invertible Matrix Theorem in a table 
that imbeds these ideas in a broader discussion of rectangular matrices. The statements are arranged in three 
columns: statements that are logically equivalent for any m×n matrix and are related to existence concepts, 
those that are equivalent only for any n×n matrix, and those that are equivalent for any n×p matrix and are 
related to uniqueness concepts. Four statements are included that are not in the text’s official list of 
statements, to give more symmetry to the three columns. You may or may not wish to comment on them.  
I believe that students cannot fully understand the concepts in the IMT if they do not know the correct 
wording of each statement. (Of course, this knowledge is not sufficient for understanding.) The Study  
Guide’s Section 2.3 has an example of the type of question I often put on an exam at this point in the course. 
The section concludes with a discussion of reviewing and reflecting, as important steps to a mastery of linear 
algebra.

Notes: Partitioned matrices arise in theoretical discussions in essentially every field that makes use of 
matrices. The Study Guide mentions some examples (with references).  
Every student should be exposed to some of the ideas in this section. If time is short, you might omit 
Example 4 and Theorem 10, and replace Example 5 by a problem similar to one in Exercises 1–10. (A sample 
replacement is given at the end of these solutions.) Then select homework from Exercises 1–13, 15, and 21–
24.  
The exercises just mentioned provide a good environment for practicing matrix manipulation. Also, 
students will be reminded that an equation of the form AB = I does not by itself make A or B invertible. (The 
matrices must be square and the IMT is required.)

 Since the (2, 1) blocks are equal, Z = C. Since the (1, 2) blocks are equal, BY = I. To proceed further, 
assume that B and Y are square. Then the equation BY =I implies that B is invertible, by the IMT, and  
Y = B–1. (See the boxed remark that follows the IMT.) Finally, from the equality of the (1, 1) blocks, 
 
  
BX = –A,    B–1BX = B–1(–A),   and   X = –B–1A. 
 
 The order of the factors for X is crucial. 
Note: For simplicity, statements (j) and (k) in the Invertible Matrix Theorem involve square matrices 
C and D. Actually, if A is n×n and if C is any matrix such that AC is the n×n identity matrix, then C must be 
n×n, too. (For AC to be defined, C must have n rows, and the equation AC = I implies that C has n columns.)  
Similarly, DA = I implies that D is n×n. Rather than discuss this in class, I expect that in Exercises 5–8, when 

104 CHAPTER 2 • Matrix Algebra 
students see an equation such as BY = I, they will decide that both B and Y should be square in order to use 
the IMT.

 To use the equality of the (1, 1) blocks, assume that A and X are square. By the IMT, the equation

if C and Z are assumed to be square, then the equation ZC = I implies that C is invertible, by the IMT, 
and Z = C–1. Finally, use the (2, 1) blocks and right-multiplication by A–1: 
 
  
YA = –ZB = –C–1B,    YAA–1 = (–C–1B)A–1,   and   Y = –C–1BA–1

 To use the equality of the (1, 1) blocks, assume that A and X are square. By the IMT, the equation XA =I 
implies that A is invertible and X = A–1. (See the boxed remark that follows the IMT. Since AY = 0, from 
the equality of the (1, 2) blocks, left-multiplication by A–1 gives A–1AY = A–10 = 0, so Y = 0. Finally, from 
the (1, 3) blocks, AZ = –B. Left-multiplication by A–1 gives A–1AZ = A–1(–B), and Z = – A–1B. The order 
of the factors for Z is crucial. 
Note: The Study Guide tells students, “Problems such as 5–10 make good exam questions. Remember to 
mention the IMT when appropriate, and remember that matrix multiplication is generally not commutative.” 
When a problem statement includes a condition that a matrix is square, I expect my students to mention this 
fact when they apply the IMT.

 14. You are asked to establish an if and only if statement. First suppose that A is invertible. Example 5 shows 
that A11 and A22 are invertible. This proves that A is invertible only if A11 A22 are invertible. For the if part 
of this statement, suppose that A11 and A22 are invertible. Then the formula in Example 5 provides a likely

Thus the statement about lower triangular matrices is true for n = k +1 if it is true for n = k. By the 
principle of induction, the statement is true for all n > 1.

Note: Exercise 23 is good for mathematics and computer science students. The solution of Exercise 23 in the 
Study Guide shows students how to use the principle of induction. The Study Guide also has an appendix on 
“The Principle of Induction,” at the end of Section 2.4. The text presents more applications of induction in 
Section 3.2 and in the Supplementary Exercises for Chapter 3.

 The (2,1)-entry is 0 because v equals the first column of Ak., and Akw is –1 times the first column of Ak.

 The (2,1)-entry is 0T because vT times a column of Bk equals the sum of the entries in the column, and all 
of such sums are zero except the last, which is 1. So vTBk is the negative of wT. By the principle of 
induction, AnBn = In for all n > 2. Since An and Bn are square, the IMT shows that these matrices are 
invertible, and

 26. [M] This exercise and the next, which involve large matrices, are more appropriate for MATLAB, 
Maple, and Mathematica, than for the graphic calculators. 
a. Display the submatrix of A obtained from rows 15 to 20 and columns 5 to 10.  
  MATLAB:    
A(15:20, 5:10)  
  Maple:  
submatrix(A, 15..20, 5..10) 
  Mathematica:  
Take[ A, {15,20}, {5,10} ] 
b. Insert a 5×10 matrix B into rows 10 to 14 and columns 20 to 29 of matrix A: 
  MATLAB:   A(10:14, 20:29) = B ;   
The semicolon suppresses output display. 
  Maple:  
copyinto(B, A, 10, 20): 
The colon suppresses output display. 
  Mathematica: For [ i=10, i<=14, i++, 
   
 
 For [ j=20, j<=29, j++, 
   
 
 
A [[ i,j ]] = B [[ i-9, j-19 ]] ] ]; Colon suppresses output. 
c. To create

 with MATLAB, build B out of four blocks: 
   
B = [A zeros(30,20); zeros(20,30) A’]; 
  Another method: first enter B = A ; and then enlarge B with the command 
   
B(21:50, 31:50) = A’; 
  This places AT in the (2, 2) block of the larger B and fills in the (1, 2) and (2, 1) blocks with zeros.  
  For Maple: 
   
B := matrix(50,50,0): 
   
copyinto(A, B, 1, 1): 
   
copyinto( transpose(A), B, 21, 31): 
  For Mathematica: 
  B = BlockMatrix[ {{A, ZeroMatrix[30,20]}, ZeroMatrix[20,30], 
Transpose[A]}} ] 

2.4 • Solutions   111 
 27. a. [M] Construct A from four blocks, say C11, C12, C21, and C22, for example with C11 a 30×30 matrix 
and C22 a 20×20 matrix. 
  MATLAB: 
C11 = A(1:30, 1:30) + B(1:30, 1:30) 
   
C12 = A(1:30, 31:50) + B(1:30, 31:50) 
   
C21 = A(31:50, 1:30)+ B(31:50, 1:30) 
   
C22 = A(31:50, 31:50) + B(31:50, 31:50) 
   
C = [C11 C12; C21 C22] 
  The commands in Maple and Mathematica are analogous, but with different syntax. The first 
commands are: 
  Maple: 
C11 := submatrix(A, 1..30, 1..30) + submatrix(B, 1..30, 1..30) 
  Mathematica:  
c11 := Take[ A, {1,30), {1,30} ] + Take[B, {1,30), {1,30} ]

found, rewrite the equation A21x1 + A22x2 = b2 as A22x2 = c, where c = b2 – A21x1, and solve A22x2 = c 
for x2.

 (*) 
 
 Solution: 
 
 This matrix equation provides four equations that can be used to find X, Y, and Z: 
 
  
X + 0 = I, 
0 = 0 
 
  
YI + ZA = C, 
 Y0 + ZB = I 
(Note the order of the factors.) 
 
 The first equation says that X = I. To solve the fourth equation, ZB = I, assume that B and Z are square.  
In this case, the equation ZB = I implies that B and Z are invertible, by the IMT. (Actually, it suffices to 
assume either that B is square or that Z is square.) Then, right-multiply each side of ZB = I to get  
ZBB–1 = IB–1 and Z = B–1. Finally, the third equation is Y + ZA = C. So, Y + B–1A = C, and Y = C – B–1A. 
 
  
The following counterexample shows that Z need not be square for the equation (*) above to be true.

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: Modern algorithms in numerical linear algebra are often described using matrix factorizations. For 
practical work, this section is more important than Sections 4.7 and 5.4, even though matrix factorizations are 
explained nicely in terms of change of bases. Computational exercises in this section emphasize the use of the 
LU factorization to solve linear systems. The LU factorization is performed using the algorithm explained in 
the paragraphs before Example 2, and performed in Example 2. The text discusses how to build L when no 
interchanges are needed to reduce the given matrix to U. An appendix in the Study Guide discusses how to 
build L in permuted unit lower triangular form when row interchanges are needed. Other factorizations are 
introduced in Exercises 22–26.

 19. Let A be a lower-triangular n × n matrix with nonzero entries on the diagonal, and consider the 
augmented matrix [A  I]. 
a. The (1, 1)-entry can be scaled to 1 and the entries below it can be changed to 0 by adding multiples 
of row 1 to the rows below. This affects only the first column of A and the first column of I. So the 
(2, 2)-entry in the new matrix is still nonzero and now is the only nonzero entry of row 2 in the first 
 n columns (because A was lower triangular). 
   
The (2, 2)-entry can be scaled to 1, the entries below it can be changed to 0 by adding multiples 
of row 2 to the rows below. This affects only columns 2 and n + 2 of the augmented matrix. Now the 
(3, 3) entry in A is the only nonzero entry of the third row in the first n columns, so it can be scaled to 
1 and then used as a pivot to zero out entries below it. Continuing in this way, A is eventually reduced 
to I, by scaling each row with a pivot and then using only row operations that add multiples of the 
pivot row to rows below. 
b. The row operations just described only add rows to rows below, so the I on the right in [A I] changes 
into a lower triangular matrix. By Theorem 7 in Section 2.2, that matrix is A–1. 
 20. Let A = LU be an LU factorization for A. Since L is unit lower triangular, it is invertible by Exercise 19. 
Thus by the Invertible Matrix Theroem, L may be row reduced to I. But L is unit lower triangular, so it 
can be row reduced to I by adding suitable multiples of a row to the rows below it, beginning with the top 
row. Note that all of the described row operations done to L are row-replacement operations. If 
elementary matrices E1, E2, … Ep implement these row-replacement operations, then

 This shows that A may be row reduced to U using only row-replacement operations. 
 21. (Solution in Study Guide.) Suppose A = BC, with B invertible. Then there exist elementary matrices  
E1, …, Ep corresponding to row operations that reduce B to I, in the sense that Ep … E1B = I. Applying 
the same sequence of row operations to A amounts to left-multiplying A by the product Ep … E1. By 
associativity of matrix multiplication.

operations:

 Now notice that the bottom two rows of U contain only zeros. If one uses the row-column method to find 
LU, the entries in the final two columns of L will not be used, since these entries will be multiplied zeros 
from the bottom two rows of U. So let B be the first three columns of L and let C be the top three rows of 
U. That is,

 Then B and C have the desired sizes and BC = LU = A. We can generalize this process to the case where 
A in m × n, A = LU, and U has only three non-zero rows: let B be the first three columns of L and let C be 
the top three rows of U. 
 23. a. Express each row of D as the transpose of a column vector. Then use the multiplication rule for 
partitioned matrices to write

  which is the sum of four outer products. 
b. Since A has 400 × 100 = 40000 entries, C has 400 × 4 = 1600 entries and D has 4 × 100 = 400 entries, 
to store C and D together requires only 2000 entries, which is 5% of the amount of entries needed to 
store A directly.

 24. Since Q is square and QTQ = I, Q is invertible by the Invertible Matrix Theorem and Q–1 = QT. Thus A is 
the product of invertible matrices and hence is invertible. Thus by Theorem 5, the equation Ax = b has a 
unique solution for all b. From Ax = b, we have QRx = b, QTQRx = QTb, Rx = QTb, and finally x =  
R–1QTb. A good algorithm for finding x is to compute QTb and then row reduce the matrix [ R  QTb ]. See 
Exercise 11 in Section 2.2 for details on why this process works. The reduction is fast in this case 
because R is a triangular matrix. 
 25. A = UDV T . Since U and V T  are square, the equations U T U = I and V T V = I imply that U and V T  are 
invertible, by the IMT, and hence U–1 = UT and (VT)–1 = V. Since the diagonal entries 
1,

nonzero, D is invertible, with the inverse of D being the diagonal matrix with

 Set the (2, 1) entries equal and obtain R2 = 4 ohms. Substitute this value for R2, equating the (2, 2) entries 
and solving gives R1 = 8 ohms. Likewise equating the (1, 1) entries gives R3 = 4/3 ohms.

Note: The Study Guide’s MATLAB box for Section 2.5 suggests that for most LU factorizations in this 
section, students can use the gauss command repeatedly to produce U, and use paper and mental 
arithmetic to write down the columns of L as the row reduction to U proceeds. This is because for Exercises 
7–16 the pivots are integers and other entries are simple fractions. However, for Exercises 31 and 32 this is 
not reasonable, and students are expected to solve an elementary programming problem. (The Study Guide 
provides no hints.) 
 31. [M]  Store the matrix A in a temporary matrix B and create L initially as the 8×8 identity matrix. The 
following sequence of MATLAB commands fills in the entries of L below the diagonal, one column at a 
time, until the first seven columns are filled. (The eighth column is the final column of the identity 
matrix.) 
   
L(2:8, 1) = B(2:8, 1)/B(1, 1) 
   
B = gauss(B, 1) 
   
L(3:8, 2) = B(3:8, 2)/B(2, 2) 
   
B = gauss(B, 2) 
   
# 
   
L(8:8, 7) = B(8:8, 7)/B(7, 7) 
   
U = gauss(B,7) 
 
 Of course, some students may realize that a loop will speed up the process. The for..end syntax is 
illustrated in the MATLAB box for Section 5.6. Here is a MATLAB program that includes the initial 
setup of B and L: 
 
  
B = A 
   
L = eye(8) 
   
for j=1:7 
   
  L(j+1:8, j) = B(j+1:8, j)/B(j, j) 
   
  B = gauss(B, j) 
   
end 
 
  
U = B

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: This section is independent of Section 1.10. The material here makes a good backdrop for the series 
expansion of (I–C)–1 because this formula is actually used in some practical economic work. Exercise 8 gives 
an interpretation to entries of an inverse matrix that could be stated without the economic context. 
 1. The answer to this exercise will depend upon the order in which the student chooses to list the sectors. 
The important fact to remember is that each column is the unit consumption vector for the appropriate 
sector. If we order the sectors manufacturing, agriculture, and services, then the consumption matrix is

 So x = (82.8, 131.0, 110.3). 
 10. From Exercise 8, the (i, j) entry in (I – C)–1 corresponds to the effect on production of sector i when the 
final demand for the output of sector j increases by one unit. Since these entries are all positive, an 
increase in the final demand for any sector will cause the production of all sectors to increase. Thus an 
increase in the demand for any sector will lead to an increase in the demand for all sectors. 
 11. (Solution in study Guide) Following the hint in the text, compute pTx in two ways. First, take the 
transpose of both sides of the price equation, p = C Tp + v, to obtain

 so x = (99576, 97703, 51321, 131570, 49488, 329554, 13835). Since the entries in d seem to be accurate 
to the nearest thousand, a more realistic answer would be x = (100000, 98000, 51000, 132000, 49000,

 so x = (134034, 131687, 69472, 176912, 66596, 443773, 18431). To the nearest thousand, x = (134000,

 so x(12) is the first vector whose entries are accurate to the nearest thousand. The calculation of x(12) takes 
about 1260 flops, while the row reduction above takes about 550 flops. If C is larger than 20
20,
×
 then 
fewer flops are required to compute x(12) by iteration than by row reduction. The advantage of the 
iterative method increases with the size of C. The matrix C also becomes more sparse for larger models, 
so fewer iterations are needed for good accuracy.

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: The content of this section seems to have universal appeal with students. It also provides practice with 
composition of linear transformations. The case study for Chapter 2 concerns computer graphics – see this 
case study (available as a project on the website) for more examples of computer graphics in action. The 
Study Guide encourages the student to examine the book by Foley referenced in the text. This section could 
form the beginning of an independent study on computer graphics with an interested student.

. To rotate about the point (6, 8), first translate by (–6, –8), then rotate about the 
origin, then translate back by (6, 8) (see the Practice Problem in this section). A 60° rotation about (6, 8)

. To rotate about the point (3, 7), first translate by (–3, –7), then rotate about the 
origin, then translate back by (3, 7) (see the Practice Problem in this section). A 45° rotation about (3, 7) 
is thus is given in homogeneous coordinates by the matrix

 9. To produce each entry in BD two multiplications are necessary. Since BD is a 2
200
×
 matrix, it will take 
2
2
200
800
× ×
=
multiplications to compute BD. By the same reasoning it will take 2
2
200
× ×
=  800 
multiplications to compute A(BD). Thus to compute A(BD) from the beginning will take 800 + 800 = 
1600 multiplications. 
 
  
To compute the 2
2
×
 matrix AB it will take 2
2
2
8
×
×
=
 multiplications, and to compute (AB)D it 
will take 2

800

 multiplications. Thus to compute (AB)D from the beginning will take  
8 + 800 = 808 multiplications. 
 
  
For computer graphics calculations that require applying multiple transformations to data matrices, 
it is thus more efficient to compute the product of the transformation matrices before applying the result 
to the data matrix.

 Finally, the columns of this matrix may be converted from homogeneous coordinates by dividing by the 
final coordinate:

(7, 2, 0)
(6, 4, 0, .8)
(6/.8, 2/.8, 0/.8)

 So the coordinates of the vertices of the transformed triangle are (7, 2, 0), (7.5, 5, 0), and (5, 5, 0).

 Finally, the columns of this matrix may be converted from homogeneous coordinates by dividing by the 
final coordinate:

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: Cover this section only if you plan to skip most or all of Chapter 4. This section and the next cover 
everything you need from Sections 4.1–4.6 to discuss the topics in Section 4.9 and Chapters 5–7 (except for 
the general inner product spaces in Sections 6.7 and 6.8). Students may use Section 4.2 for review, particu-
larly the Table near the end of the section. (The final subsection on linear transformations should be omitted.) 
Example 6 and the associated exercises are critical for work with eigenspaces in Chapters 5 and 7. Exercises 
31–36 review the Invertible Matrix Theorem. New statements will be added to this theorem in Section 2.9. 
Key Exercises: 5–20 and 23–26. 
 1. The set is closed under sums but not under multiplication  
by a negative scalar. A counterexample to the subspace  
condition is shown at the right. 
Note: Most students prefer to give a geometric counterexample, but some may choose an algebraic calcu-
lation. The four exercises here should help students develop an understanding of subspaces, but they may be 
insufficient if you want students to be able to analyze an unfamiliar set on an exam. Developing that skill 
seems more appropriate for classes covering Sections 4.1–4.6.

 2. The set is closed under scalar multiples but not sums. 
For example, the sum of the vectors u and v shown 
here is not in H. 
 3. No. The set is not closed under sums or scalar multiples. The subset  
consisting of the points on the line x2 = x1 is a subspace, so any  
“counterexample” must use at least one point not on this line.  
Here are two counterexamples to the subspace conditions: 
 4. No. The set is closed under sums, but not under multiplication by a 
negative scalar. 
 5. The vector w is in the subspace generated by v1 and v2 if and only if the vector equation x1v1 + x2v2 = w 
is consistent. The row operations below show that w is not in the subspace generated by v1 and v2.

 Yes, u is in Nul A. 
11. p = 4 and q = 3. Nul A is a subspace of R4 because solutions of Ax = 0 must have 4 entries, to match the 
columns of A. Col A is a subspace of R3 because each column vector has 3 entries. 
12. p = 3 and q = 4. Nul A is a subspace of R3 because solutions of Ax = 0 must have 3 entries, to match the

13. To produce a vector in Col A, select any column of A. For Nul A, solve the equation Ax = 0. (Include an 
augmented column of zeros, to avoid errors.)

 The general solution is x1 = x3 – x4, and x2 = –2x3 + 4x4, with x3 and x4 free. The general solution in 
parametric vector form is not needed. All that is required here is one nonzero vector. So choose any 
values for x3 and x4 (not both zero). For instance, set x3 = 1 and x4 = 0 to obtain the vector (1, –2, 1, 0) in 
Nul A. 
Note: Section 2.8 of Study Guide introduces the ref command (or rref, depending on the technology), 
which produces the reduced echelon form of a matrix. This will greatly speed up homework for students who 
have a matrix program available.

 The general solution is x1 = (1/3)x3 and x2 = (–5/3) x3, with x3 free. The general solution in parametric 
vector form is not needed. All that is required here is one nonzero vector. So choose any values of x3 and 
x4 (not both zero). For instance, set x3 = 3 to obtain the vector (1, –5, 3) in Nul A. 

142 CHAPTER 2 • Matrix Algebra 
15. Yes. Let A be the matrix whose columns are the vectors given. Then A is invertible because its 
determinant is nonzero, and so its columns form a basis for R2, by the Invertible Matrix Theorem (or by 
Example 5). (Other reasons for the invertibility of A could be given.) 
16. No. One vector is a multiple of the other, so they are linearly dependent and hence cannot be a basis for 
any subspace.

 The matrix A has three pivots, so A is invertible by the IMT and its columns form a basis for R3 (as 
pointed out in Example 5). 
19. No. The vectors cannot be a basis for R3 because they only span a plan in R3. Or, point out that the

 cannot possibly span R3 because the matrix cannot have a pivot in 
every row. So the columns are not a basis for R3.  
Note: The Study Guide warns students not to say that the two vectors here are a basis for R2. 
20. No. The vectors are linearly dependent because there are more vectors in the set than entries in each 
vector. (Theorem 8 in Section 1.7.) So the vectors cannot be a basis for any subspace. 
21. a. False. See the definition at the beginning of the section. The critical phrases “for each” are missing. 
b. True. See the paragraph before Example 4. 
c. False. See Theorem 12. The null space is a subspace of Rn, not Rm. 
d. True. See Example 5. 
e. True. See the first part of the solution of Example 8. 
22. a. False. See the definition at the beginning of the section. The condition about the zero vector is only 
one of the conditions for a subspace. 
b. True. See Example 3. 
c. True. See Theorem 12. 
d. False. See the paragraph after Example 4. 
e. False. See the Warning that follows Theorem 13.

Notes: (1) A basis is a set of vectors. For simplicity, the answers here and in the text list the vectors without 
enclosing the list inside set brackets. This style is also easier for students. I am careful, however, to 
distinguish between a matrix and the set or list whose elements are the columns of the matrix. 
(2) Recall from Chapter 1 that students are encouraged to use the augmented matrix when solving Ax = 0, 
to avoid the common error of misinterpreting the reduced echelon form of A as itself the augmented matrix 
for a nonhomogeneous system. 
(3) Because the concept of a basis is just being introduced, I insist that my students write the parametric 
vector form of the solution of Ax = 0. They see how the basis vectors span the solution space and are 
obviously linearly independent. A shortcut, which some instructors might introduce later in the course, is only 
to solve for the basic variables and to produce each basis vector one at a time. Namely, set all free variables 
equal to zero except for one free variable, and set that variable equal to a suitable nonzero number.

27. Construct a nonzero 3×3 matrix A and construct b to be almost any convenient linear combination of the 
columns of A. 

2.8 • Solutions   145 
28. The easiest construction is to write a 3×3 matrix in echelon form that has only 2 pivots, and let b be any 
vector in R3 whose third entry is nonzero. 
29. (Solution in Study Guide) A simple construction is to write any nonzero 3×3 matrix whose columns are 
obviously linearly dependent, and then make b a vector of weights from a linear dependence relation 
among the columns. For instance, if the first two columns of A are equal, then b could be (1, –1, 0). 
30. Since Col A is the set of all linear combinations of a1, … , ap, the set {a1, … , ap} spans Col A. Because 
{a1, … , ap} is also linearly independent, it is a basis for Col A. (There is no need to discuss pivot 
columns and Theorem 13, though a proof could be given using this information.) 
31. If Col F ≠ R5, then the columns of F do not span R5. Since F is square, the IMT shows that F is not 
invertible and the equation Fx = 0 has a nontrivial solution. That is, Nul F contains a nonzero vector. 
Another way to describe this is to write Nul F ≠ {0}. 
32. If Nul R contains nonzero vectors, then the equation Rx = 0 has nontrivial solutions. Since R is square, 
the IMT shows that R is not invertible and the columns of R do not span R6. So Col R is a subspace of 
R6, but Col R ≠ R6. 
33. If Col Q = R4, then the columns of Q span R4. Since Q is square, the IMT shows that Q is invertible and 
the equation Qx = b has a solution for each b in R4. Also, each solution is unique, by Theorem 5 in 
Section 2.2. 
34. If Nul P = {0}, then the equation Px = 0 has only the trivial solution. Since P is square, the IMT shows 
that P is invertible and the equation Px = b has a solution for each b in R5. Also, each solution is unique, 
by Theorem 5 in Section 2.2.  
35. If the columns of B are linearly independent, then the equation Bx = 0 has only the trivial (zero) solution. 
That is, Nul B = {0}. 
36. If the columns of A form a basis, they are linearly independent. This means that A cannot have more 
columns than rows. Since the columns also span Rm, A must have a pivot in each row, which means that 
A cannot have more rows than columns. As a result, A must be a square matrix. 
37. [M] Use the command that produces the reduced echelon form in one step (ref or rref depending  
on the program). See the Section 2.8 in the Study Guide for details. By Theorem 13, the pivot columns of 
A form a basis for Col A.

Note: The Study Guide for Section 2.8 gives directions for students to construct a review sheet for the 
concept of a subspace and the two main types of subspaces, Col A and Nul A, and a review sheet for the 
concept of a basis. I encourage you to consider making this an assignment for your class.

Notes: This section contains the ideas from Sections 4.4–4.6 that are needed for later work in Chapters 5–7. 
If you have time, you can enrich the geometric content of “coordinate systems” by discussing crystal lattices 
(Example 3 and Exercises 35 and 36 in Section 4.4.) Some students might profit from reading Examples 1–3 
from Section 4.4 and Examples 2, 4, and 5 from Section 4.6. Section 4.5 is probably not a good reference for 
students who have not considered general vector spaces. 
Coordinate vectors are important mainly to give an intuitive and geometric feeling for the isomorphism 
between a k-dimensional subspace and Rk. If you plan to omit Sections 5.4, 5.6, 5.7 and 7.2, you can safely 
omit Exercises 1–8 here.  

2.9 • Solutions   147 
Exercises 1–16 may be assigned after students have read as far as Example 2. Exercises 19 and 20 use the 
Rank Theorem, but they can also be assigned before the Rank Theorem is discussed.  
The Rank Theorem in this section omits the nontrivial fact about Row A which is included in the Rank 
Theorem of Section 4.6, but that is used only in Section 7.4. The row space itself can be introduced in Section 
6.2, for use in Chapter 6 and Section 7.4. 
Exercises 9–16 include important review of techniques taught in Section 2.8 (and in Sections 1.2 and 2.5). 
They make good test questions because they require little arithmetic. My students need the practice here. 
Nearly every time I teach the course and start Chapter 5, I find that at least one or two students cannot find a 
basis for a two-dimensional eigenspace!

 Columns 1, 2 and 4, of the echelon form certain cannot span Col A since those vectors all have zero in

 Columns 1, 3, and 4 of the original matrix form a basis for H, so dim H = 3. 
Note: Either Exercise 13 or 14 should be assigned because there are always one or two students who confuse 
Col A with Nul A. Or, they wrongly connect “set of linear combinations” with “parametric vector form” (of 
the general solution of Ax = 0).

 Columns 1 and 2 of the original matrix form a basis for H, so dim H = 2.  

2.9 • Solutions   151 
15. Col A = R3, because A has a pivot in each row and so the columns of A span R3. Nul A cannot equal R2, 
because Nul A is a subspace of R5. It is true, however, that Nul A is two-dimensional. Reason: the 
equation Ax = 0 has two free variables, because A has five columns and only three of them are pivot 
columns. 
16. Col A cannot be R3 because the columns of A have four entries. (In fact, Col A is a 3-dimensional 
subspace of R4, because the 3 pivot columns of A form a basis for Col A.) Since A has 7 columns and 
3 pivot columns, the equation Ax = 0 has 4 free variables. So, dim Nul A = 4. 
17. a. True. This is the definition of a B-coordinate vector. 
b. False. Dimension is defined only for a subspace. A line must be through the origin in Rn to be a 
subspace of Rn. 
c. True. The sentence before Example 1 concludes that the number of pivot columns of A is the rank of 
A, which is the dimension of Col A by definition. 
d. True. This is equivalent to the Rank Theorem because rank A is the dimension of Col A. 
e. True, by the Basis Theorem. In this case, the spanning set is automatically a linearly independent set. 
18. a. True. This fact is justified in the second paragraph of this section. 
b. True. See the second paragraph after Fig. 1. 
c. False. The dimension of Nul A is the number of free variables in the equation Ax = 0.  
See Example 2. 
d. True, by the definition of rank. 
e. True, by the Basis Theorem. In this case, the linearly independent set is automatically a spanning set. 
19. The fact that the solution space of Ax = 0 has a basis of three vectors means that dim Nul A = 3. Since a 
5×7 matrix A has 7 columns, the Rank Theorem shows that rank A = 7 – dim Nul A = 4.  
Note: One can solve Exercises 19–22 without explicit reference to the Rank Theorem. For instance, in 
Exercise 19, if the null space of a matrix A is three-dimensional, then the equation Ax = 0 has three free 
variables, and three of the columns of A are nonpivot columns. Since a 5×7 matrix has seven columns, A must 
have four pivot columns (which form a basis of Col A). So rank A = dim Col A = 4. 
20. A 4×5 matrix A has 5 columns. By the Rank Theorem, rank A = 5 – dim Nul A. Since the null space is 
three-dimensional, rank A = 2. 
21. A 7×6 matrix has 6 columns. By the Rank Theorem, dim Nul A = 6 – rank A. Since the rank is four, dim 
Nul A = 2. That is, the dimension of the solution space of Ax = 0 is two. 
22. The wording of this problem was poor in the first printing, because the phrase “it spans a four-
dimensional subspace” was never defined. Here is a revision that I will put in later printings of the third 
edition:  
 
  
Show that a set {v1, …, v5} in Rn is linearly dependent if dim Span{v1, …, v5} = 4. 
 
 Solution: Suppose that the subspace H = Span{v1, …, v5} is four-dimensional. If {v1, …, v5} were 
linearly independent, it would be a basis for H. This is impossible, by the statement just before the 
definition of dimension in Section 2.9, which essentially says that every basis of a p-dimensional 
subspace consists of p vectors. Thus, {v1, …, v5} must be linearly dependent. 
23. A 3×4 matrix A with a two-dimensional column space has two pivot columns. The remaining two 
columns will correspond to free variables in the equation Ax = 0. So the desired construction is possible.

. A simple 
construction is to take two vectors in R3 that are obviously not linearly dependent, and put two copies of 
these two vectors in any order. The resulting matrix will obviously have a two-dimensional column 
space. There is no need to worry about whether Nul A has the correct dimension, since this is guaranteed 
by the Rank Theorem: dim Nul A = 4 – rank A. 
24. A rank 1 matrix has a one-dimensional column space. Every column is a multiple of some fixed vector. 
To construct a 4×3 matrix, choose any nonzero vector in R4, and use it for one column. Choose any 
multiples of the vector for the other two columns. 
25. The p columns of A span Col A by definition. If dim Col A = p, then the spanning set of p columns is 
automatically a basis for Col A, by the Basis Theorem. In particular, the columns are linearly 
independent. 
26. If columns a1, a3, a5, and a6 of A are linearly independent and if dim Col A = 4, then {a1, a3, a5, a6} is a 
linearly independent set in a 4-dimensional column space. By the Basis Theorem, this set of four vectors 
is a basis for the column space. 
27. a. Start with B = [b1   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅   bp] and A = [a1   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅   aq], where q > p. For j = 1, …, q, the vector aj is 
in W. Since the columns of B span W, the vector aj is in the column space of B. That is, aj = Bcj for 
some vector cj of weights. Note that cj is in Rp because B has p columns. 
b. Let C = [c1   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅   cq]. Then C is a p×q matrix because each of the q columns is in Rp.  
By hypothesis, q is larger than p, so C has more columns than rows. By a theorem, the columns of 
C are linearly dependent and there exists a nonzero vector u in Rq such that Cu = 0. 
c. From part (a) and the definition of matrix multiplication 
   
A = [a1   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅   aq] = [Bc1   ⋅ ⋅ ⋅   Bcq] = BC 
  From part (b), Au = (BC)u = B(Cu) = B0 = 0. Since u is nonzero, the columns of A are linearly 
dependent. 
28. If A contained more vectors than B, then A would be linearly dependent, by Exercise 27, because B  
spans W. Repeat the argument with B and A interchanged to conclude that B cannot contain more  
vectors than A.

 The equation c1v1 + c2v2 = x is consistent, so x is in the subspace H. The decimal approximations suggest 
c1 = –5/3 and c2 = 8/3, and it can be checked that these values are precise. Thus, the B-coordinate of x is 
(–5/3, 8/3).

 The first three columns of [v1   v2   v3   x] are pivot columns, so v1, v2 and v3 are linearly independent. 
Thus v1, v2 and v3 form a basis B for the subspace H which they span. View [v1   v2   v3   x] as an 
augmented matrix for c1v1 + c2v2 + c3v3 = x. The reduced echelon form shows that x is in H and

Notes: The Study Guide for Section 2.9 contains a complete list of the statements in the Invertible Matrix 
Theorem that have been given so far. The format is the same as that used in Section 2.3, with three columns: 
statements that are logically equivalent for any m×n matrix and are related to existence concepts, those that 
are equivalent only for any n×n matrix, and those that are equivalent for any n×p matrix and are related to 
uniqueness concepts. Four statements are included that are not in the text’s official list of statements, to give 
more symmetry to the three columns. 
The Study Guide section also contains directions for making a review sheet for “dimension” and “rank.” 
Chapter 2 SUPPLEMENTARY EXERCISES 
 1. a. True. If A and B are m×n matrices, then BT has as many rows as A has columns, so ABT is defined. 
Also, ATB is defined because AT has m columns and B has m rows. 
b. False. B must have 2 columns. A has as many columns as B has rows. 
c. True. The ith row of A has the form (0, …, di, …, 0). So the ith row of AB is (0, …, di, …, 0)B, which 
is di times the ith row of B. 
d. False. Take the zero matrix for B. Or, construct a matrix B such that the equation Bx = 0 has 
nontrivial solutions, and construct C and D so that C ≠ D and the columns of C – D satisfy the 
equation Bx = 0. Then B(C – D) = 0 and BC = BD.

f. False. (A + B)(A – B) = A2 – AB + BA – B2. This equals A2 – B2 if and only if A commutes with B. 
g. True. An n×n replacement matrix has n + 1 nonzero entries. The n×n scale and interchange matrices 
have n nonzero entries. 
h. True. The transpose of an elementary matrix is an elementary matrix of the same type. 
i. True. An n×n elementary matrix is obtained by a row operation on In. 
j. False. Elementary matrices are invertible, so a product of such matrices is invertible. But not every 
square matrix is invertible. 
k. True. If A is 3×3 with three pivot positions, then A is row equivalent to I3. 
l. False. A must be square in order to conclude from the equation AB = I that A is invertible. 
m. False. AB is invertible, but (AB)–1 = B–1A–1, and this product is not always equal to A–1B–1. 
n. True. Given AB = BA, left-multiply by A–1 to get B = A–1BA, and then right-multiply by A–1 to obtain 
BA–1 = A–1B. 
o. False. The correct equation is (rA)–1 = r–1A–1, because  
  (rA)(r–1A–1) = (rr–1)(AA–1) = 1⋅I = I. 
p. True. If the equation Ax =

 has a unique solution, then there are no free variables in this equation, 
which means that A must have three pivot positions (since A is 3×3). By the Invertible Matrix 
Theorem, A is invertible.

 If An = 0, then the matrix B = I + A + A2 +  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  + An–1 satisfies (I – A)B = I. Since I – A and B are square, 
they are invertible by the Invertible Matrix Theorem, and B is the inverse of I – A. 
 5. A2 = 2A – I. Multiply by A: A3 = 2A2 – A. Substitute A2 = 2A – I: A3 = 2(2A – I) – A = 3A – 2I. 
Multiply by A again: A
4 = A(3A – 2I) = 3A
2 – 2A. Substitute the identity A
2 = 2A – I again: 
 
 Finally, A4 = 3(2A – I) – 2A = 4A – 3I.

Note: Variants of this question make simple exam questions. 
10. Since A is invertible, so is AT, by the Invertible Matrix Theorem. Then ATA is the product of invertible 
matrices and so is invertible. Thus, the formula (ATA)–1AT makes sense. By Theorem 6 in Section 2.2, 
 
  
(ATA)–1⋅AT = A–1(AT)–1AT = A–1I = A–1 
 
 An alternative calculation: (ATA)–1AT⋅A = (ATA)–1(ATA) = I. Since A is invertible, this equation shows that 
its inverse is (ATA)–1AT.

  Thus, p(xi) = yi. To summarize, the entries in Vc are the values of the polynomial p(x) at x1, …, xn. 
b. Suppose x1, …, xn are distinct, and suppose Vc = 0 for some vector c. Then the entries in c are the 
coefficients of a polynomial whose value is zero at the distinct points x1, ..., xn. However, a nonzero 
polynomial of degree n – 1 cannot have n zeros, so the polynomial must be identically zero. That is, 
the entries in c must all be zero. This shows that the columns of V are linearly independent. 
c. (Solution in Study Guide) When x1, …, xn are distinct, the columns of V are linearly independent,  
by (b). By the Invertible Matrix Theorem, V is invertible and its columns span Rn. So, for every  
y = (y1, …, yn) in Rn, there is a vector c such that Vc = y. Let p be the polynomial whose coefficients 
are listed in c. Then, by (a), p is an interpolating polynomial for (x1, y1), …, (xn, yn). 
12. If A = LU, then col1(A) = L⋅col1(U). Since col1(U) has a zero in every entry except possibly the first, 
L⋅col1(U) is a linear combination of the columns of L in which all weights except possibly the first are 
zero. So col1(A) is a multiple of col1(L). 
 
  
Similarly, col2(A) = L⋅col2(U), which is a linear combination of the columns of L using the first two 
entries in col2(U) as weights, because the other entries in col2(U) are zero. Thus col2(A) is a linear 
combination of the first two columns of L. 
13. a. P2 = (uuT)(uuT) = u(uTu)uT = u(1)uT = P, because u satisfies uTu = 1. 
b. PT = (uuT)T = uTTuT = uuT = P 
c. Q2 = (I – 2P)(I – 2P) = I – I(2P) – 2PI + 2P(2P) 
   
 = I – 4P + 4P2 = I, because of part (a).

 so B is row equivalent to C. Since row operations are reversible, C is row equivalent to B. (Alternatively, 
show C being changed into B by row operations using the inverse of the Ei .) 
16. Since A is not invertible, there is a nonzero vector v in Rn such that Av = 0. Place n copies of v into an 
n×n matrix B. Then AB = A[v  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  v] = [Av  ⋅ ⋅ ⋅  Av] = 0. 
17. Let A be a 6×4 matrix and B a 4×6 matrix. Since B has more columns than rows, its six columns are 
linearly dependent and there is a nonzero x such that Bx = 0. Thus ABx = A0 = 0. This shows that the 
matrix AB is not invertible, by the IMT. (Basically the same argument was used to solve Exercise 22 in 
Section 2.1.) 
Note: (In the Study Guide) It is possible that BA is invertible. For example, let C be an invertible 4×4 matrix 
and construct

18. By hypothesis, A is 5×3, C is 3×5, and AC = I3. Suppose x satisfies Ax = b. Then CAx = Cb. Since  
CA = I, x must be Cb. This shows that Cb is the only solution of Ax = b.

 Proof: (Not required) Observe that J 2 = nJ and An J = (J – I)J = J 2 – J = (n – 1) J. Now compute 
 
  
An((n – 1)–1J – I) = (n – 1)–1A nJ – An = J – (J – I) = I 
 
 Since An is square, An is invertible and its inverse is (n – 1)–1J – I.

Notes: Some exercises in this section provide practice in computing determinants, while others allow the 
student to discover the properties of determinants which will be studied in the next section. Determinants are 
developed through the cofactor expansion, which is given in Theorem 1. Exercises 33–36 in this section 
provide the first step in the inductive proof of Theorem 3 in the next section.

on the determinant of a matrix. These properties are first studied by examples in Exercises 1–20. The 
properties are treated in a more theoretical manner in later exercises. An efficient method for computing the 
determinant using row reduction and selective cofactor expansion is presented in this section and used in 
Exercises 11–14. Theorems 4 and 6 are used extensively in Chapter 5. The linearity property of the 
determinant studied in the text is optional, but is used in more advanced courses. 
 1. Rows 1 and 2 are interchanged, so the determinant changes sign (Theorem 3b.). 
 2. The constant 2 may be factored out of the Row 1 (Theorem 3c.). 
 3. The row replacement operation does not change the determinant (Theorem 3a.). 
 4. The row replacement operation does not change the determinant (Theorem 3a.).

 30. Suppose the two rows of a square matrix A are equal. By swapping these two rows, the matrix A is not 
changed so its determinant should not change. But since swapping rows changes the sign of the 
determinant, det A = – det A. This is only possible if det A = 0. The same may be proven true for columns 
by applying the above result to 
T
A  and using Theorem 5.

 45. [M] Answers will vary, but will show that det
T
A A  always equals 0 while det
T
AA  should seldom be 
zero. To see why 
T
A A  should not be invertible (and thus det
0
T
A A =
), let A be a matrix with more 
columns than rows. Then the columns of A must be linearly dependent, so the equation Ax = 0 must have 
a non-trivial solution x. Thus (

A A

non-trivial solution. Since 
T
A A  is a square matrix, the Invertible Matrix Theorem now says that 
T
A A  is 
not invertible. Notice that the same argument will not work in general for 
,
T
AA
 since 
T
A  has more rows 
than columns, so its columns are not automatically linearly dependent. 
 46. [M] One may compute for this matrix that det A = 1 and cond A ≈ 23683. Note that this is the

A  
condition number, which is used in Section 2.3. Since det A ≠ 0, it is invertible and

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: This section features several independent topics from which to choose. The geometric interpretation 
of the determinant (Theorem 10) provides the key to changes of variables in multiple integrals. Students of 
economics and engineering are likely to need Cramer’s Rule in later courses. Exercises 1–10 concern 
Cramer’s Rule, exercises 11–18 deal with the adjugate, and exercises 19–32 cover the geometric 
interpretation of the determinant. In particular, Exercise 25 examines students’ understanding of linear 
independence and requires a careful explanation, which is discussed in the Study Guide. The Study Guide also 
contains a heuristic proof of Theorem 9 for 2 × 2 matrices.

176 CHAPTER 3 • Determinants 
 18. Each cofactor of A is an integer since it is a sum of products of entries in A. Hence all entries in adj A 
will be integers. Since det A = 1, the inverse formula in Theorem 8 shows that all the entries in 
1
A− will 
be integers. 
 19. The parallelogram is determined by the columns of 
5
6
2
4
A


= 



, so the area of the parallelogram is  
|det A| = |8| = 8. 
 20. The parallelogram is determined by the columns of 
1
4
3
5
A
−


= 

−


, so the area of the parallelogram is 
|det A| = |–7| = 7. 
 21. First translate one vertex to the origin. For example, subtract (–1, 0) from each vertex to get a new 
parallelogram with vertices (0, 0),(1, 5),(2, –4), and (3, 1). This parallelogram has the same area as the 
original, and is determined by the columns of 
1
2
5
4
A


= 

−


, so the area of the parallelogram is  
|det A| = |–14| = 14. 
 22. First translate one vertex to the origin. For example, subtract (0, –2) from each vertex to get a new 
parallelogram with vertices (0, 0),(6, 1),(–3, 3), and (3, 4). This parallelogram has the same area as  
the original, and is determined by the columns of 
6
3
1
3
A
−


= 

, so the area of the parallelogram is  
|det A| = |21| = 21.

, so the volume of the 
parallelepiped is |det A| = |–15| = 15. 
 25. The Invertible Matrix Theorem says that a 3 × 3 matrix A is not invertible if and only if its columns are 
linearly dependent. This will happen if and only if one of the columns is a linear combination of the 
others; that is, if one of the vectors is in the plane spanned by the other two vectors. This is equivalent to 
the condition that the parallelepiped determined by the three vectors has zero volume, which is in turn 
equivalent to the condition that det A = 0. 
 26. By definition, p + S is the set of all vectors of the form p + v, where v is in S. Applying T to a typical 
vector in p + S, we have T(p + v) = T(p) + T(v). This vector is in the set denoted by T(p) + T(S). This 
proves that T maps the set p + S into the set T(p) + T(S). 
 
 Conversely, any vector in T(p) + T(S) has the form T(p) + T(v) for some v in S. This vector may be 
written as T(p + v). This shows that every vector in T(p) + T(S) is the image under T of some point  
p + v in p + S.

 33. [M] Answers will vary. In MATLAB, entries in B – inv(A) are approximately 
15
10−
 or smaller. 
 34. [M] Answers will vary, as will the commands which produce the second entry of x. For example, the 
MATLAB command is x2 = det([A(:,1) b A(:,3:4)])/det(A) while the Mathematica 
command is x2 = Det[{Transpose[A][[1]],b,Transpose[A][[3]], 
Transpose[A][[4]]}]/Det[A]. 
 35. [M] MATLAB Student Version 4.0 uses 57,771 flops for inv A and 14,269,045 flops for the inverse 
formula. The inv(A) command requires only about 0.4% of the operations for the inverse formula.

the origin. If we label the vertices of this new quadrilateral as 0, 
1
v ,

v , and 
3
v , then they will be the 
vertices of a parallelogram if one of 
1
v ,

v  is the sum of the other two. In this example, subtract 
(1, 4) from each vertex to get a new parallelogram with vertices 0 = (0, 0),

Notes: This section is designed to avoid the standard exercises in which a student is asked to check ten 
axioms on an array of sets. Theorem 1 provides the main homework tool in this section for showing that a set 
is a subspace. Students should be taught how to check the closure axioms. The exercises in this section (and 
the next few sections) emphasize 
n, to give students time to absorb the abstract concepts. Other vectors do 
appear later in the chapter: the space  of signals is used in Section 4.8, and the spaces 
n of polynomials are 
used in many sections of Chapters 4 and 6.  
 1. a. If u and v are in V, then their entries are nonnegative. Since a sum of nonnegative numbers is 
nonnegative, the vector u + v has nonnegative entries. Thus u + v is in V. 
b. Example: If

 6. No. The zero vector is not in the set. 
 7. No. The set is not closed under multiplication by scalars which are not integers. 
 8. Yes. The zero vector is in the set H. If p and q are in H, then (p + q)(0) = p(0) + q(0) = 0 + 0 = 0,  
so p + q is in H. For any scalar c, (cp)(0) = c ⋅ p(0) = c ⋅ 0 = 0, so cp is in H. Thus H is a subspace by 
Theorem 1.

=

 Then H is a subset of the vector 
space V of all real-valued functions, and may be written as H = Span {cos ωt, sin ωt}. By Theorem 1,  
H is a subspace of V and is hence a vector space. 
 20. a. The following facts about continuous functions must be shown.  
   1. The constant function f(t) = 0 is continuous.  
   2. The sum of two continuous functions is continuous.  
   3. A constant multiple of a continuous function is continuous.  
b. Let H = {f in C[a, b]: f(a) = f(b)}.  
   1. Let g(t) = 0 for all t in [a, b]. Then g(a) = g(b) = 0, so g is in H.  
   2. Let g and h be in H. Then g(a) = g(b) and h(a) = h(b), and (g + h)(a) = g(a) + h(a) =  
    
g(b) + h(b) = (g + h)(b), so g + h is in H.  
   3. Let g be in H. Then g(a) = g(b), and (cg)(a) = cg(a) = cg(b) = (cg)(b), so cg is in H.  
  Thus H is a subspace of C[a, b].  
 21. The set H is a subspace of 
2 2.
M ×  The zero matrix is in H, the sum of two upper triangular matrices is 
upper triangular, and a scalar multiple of an upper triangular matrix is upper triangular. 
 22. The set H is a subspace of 
2 4.
M ×  The 2 × 4 zero matrix 0 is in H because F0 = 0. If A and B are matrices 
in H, then F(A + B) = FA + FB = 0 + 0 = 0, so A + B is in H. If A is in H and c is a scalar, then  
F(cA) = c(FA) = c0 = 0, so cA is in H.

 23. a. False. The zero vector in V is the function f whose values f(t) are zero for all t in .  
 b. False. An arrow in three-dimensional space is an example of a vector, but not every arrow is a vector.  
 c. False. See Exercises 1, 2, and 3 for examples of subsets which contain the zero vector but are not 
subspaces.  
 d. True. See the paragraph before Example 6.  
 e. False. Digital signals are used. See Example 3.

 c. True. See the paragraph before Example 6.

 e. False. The second and third parts of the conditions are stated incorrectly. For example, part (ii) does 
not state that u and v represent all possible elements of H.

 29. Consider u + (–1)u. By Axiom 10, u + (–1)u = 1u + (–1)u. By Axiom 8, 1u + (–1)u = (1 + (–1))u = 0u. 
By Exercise 27, 0u = 0. Thus u + (–1)u = 0, and by Exercise 26 (–1)u = –u.

 31. Any subspace H that contains u and v must also contain all scalar multiples of u and v, and hence must 
also contain all sums of scalar multiples of u and v. Thus H must contain all linear combinations of u  
and v, or Span {u, v}. 
Note: Exercises 32–34 provide good practice for mathematics majors because these arguments involve 
simple symbol manipulation typical of mathematical proofs. Most students outside mathematics might profit 
more from other types of exercises. 
 32. Both H and K contain the zero vector of V because they are subspaces of V. Thus the zero vector of V is 
in H ∩ K. Let u and v be in H ∩ K. Then u and v are in H. Since H is a subspace u + v is in H. Likewise 
u and v are in K. Since K is a subspace u + v is in K. Thus u + v is in H ∩ K. Let u be in H ∩ K. Then u 
is in H. Since H is a subspace cu is in H. Likewise v is in K. Since K is a subspace cu is in K. Thus cu is 
in H ∩ K for any scalar c, and H ∩ K is a subspace of V. 

4.1 • Solutions   189 
 
 The union of two subspaces is not in general a subspace. For an example in 
2 let H be the x-axis and let 
K be the y-axis. Then both H and K are subspaces of 
2, but H ∪ K is not closed under vector addition. 
The subset H ∪ K is thus not a subspace of 
2. 
 33. a. Given subspaces H and K of a vector space V, the zero vector of V belongs to H + K, because 0 is in 
both H and K (since they are subspaces) and 0 = 0 + 0. Next, take two vectors in H + K, say

  because vector addition in V is commutative and associative. Now

u
u  is in H and

v
v  is in K 
because H and K are subspaces. This shows that

w  is in H + K. Thus H + K is closed under

  The vector 
1
cu  belongs to H and 
1
cv  belongs to K, because H and K are subspaces. Thus, 
1
cw  
belongs to H + K, so H + K is closed under multiplication by scalars. These arguments show that  
H + K satisfies all three conditions necessary to be a subspace of V. 
b. Certainly H is a subset of H + K because every vector u in H may be written as u + 0, where the zero 
vector 0 is in K (and also in H, of course). Since H contains the zero vector of H + K, and H is closed 
under vector addition and multiplication by scalars (because H is a subspace of V ), H is a subspace of 
H + K. The same argument applies when H is replaced by K, so K is also a subspace of H + K.

Notes: This section provides a review of Chapter 1 using the new terminology. Linear tranformations are 
introduced quickly since students are already comfortable with the idea from 
n. The key exercises are  
17–26, which are straightforward but help to solidify the notions of null spaces and column spaces. Exercises 
30–36 deal with the kernel and range of a linear transformation and are progressively more advanced 
theoretically. The idea in Exercises 7–14 is for the student to use Theorems 1, 2, or 3 to determine whether  
a given set is a subspace.

Notes: The definition for basis is given initially for subspaces because this emphasizes that the basis elements 
must be in the subspace. Students often overlook this point when the definition is given for a vector space (see 
Exercise 25). The subsection on bases for Nul A and Col A is essential for Sections 4.5 and 4.6. The 
subsection on “Two Views of a Basis” is also fundamental to understanding the interplay between linearly 
independent sets, spanning sets, and bases. Key exercises in this section are Exercises 21–25, which help to 
deepen students’ understanding of these different subsets of a vector space. 
 1. Consider the matrix whose columns are the given set of vectors. This 3 × 3 matrix is in echelon form, and 
has 3 pivot positions. Thus by the Invertible Matrix Theorem, its columns are linearly independent and 
span 
3. So the given set of vectors is a basis for 
3. 
 2. Since the zero vector is a member of the given set of vectors, the set cannot be linearly independent  
and thus cannot be a basis for 
3. Now consider the matrix whose columns are the given set of vectors. 
This 3 × 3 matrix has only 2 pivot positions. Thus by the Invertible Matrix Theorem, its columns do  
not span 
3.

 so the matrix has only two pivot positions. Thus its columns do not form a basis for

is neither linearly independent nor does it span

 so the matrix has three pivot positions. Thus its columns form a basis for

set is linearly independent, so {sin t, sin 2t} is a basis for the subspace. 
 27. The set {cos ωt, sin ωt} spans the subspace. By inspection we note that this set is linearly independent,

Notes: Section 4.7 depends heavily on this section, as does Section 5.4. It is possible to cover the 
n parts of 
the two later sections, however, if the first half of Section 4.4 (and perhaps Example 7) is covered. The 
linearity of the coordinate mapping is used in Section 5.4 to find the matrix of a transformation relative to two 
bases. The change-of-coordinates matrix appears in Section 5.4, Theorem 8 and Exercise 27. The concept of 
an isomorphism is needed in the proof of Theorem 17 in Section 4.8. Exercise 25 is used in Section 4.7 to 
show that the change-of-coordinates matrix is invertible.

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: Theorem 9 is true because a vector space isomorphic to 
n has the same algebraic properties as 
n; a 
proof of this result may not be needed to convince the class. The proof of Theorem 9 relies upon the fact that 
the coordinate mapping is a linear transformation (which is Theorem 8 in Section 4.4). If you have skipped 
this result, you can prove Theorem 9 as is done in Introduction to Linear Algebra by Serge Lang (Springer-
Verlag, New York, 1986). There are two separate groups of true-false questions in this section; the second 
batch is more theoretical in nature. Example 4 is useful to get students to visualize subspaces of different 
dimensions, and to see the relationships between subspaces of different dimensions. Exercises 31 and 32 
investigate the relationship between the dimensions of the domain and the range of a linear transformation; 
Exercise 32 is mentioned in the proof of Theorem 17 in Section 4.8.

4.5 • Solutions   219 
 25. Note first that n ≥ 1 since S cannot have fewer than 1 vector. Since n ≥ 1, V ≠ 0. Suppose that S spans V 
and that S contains fewer than n vectors. By the Spanning Set Theorem, some subset S′  of S is a basis 
for V. Since S contains fewer than n vectors, and S′  is a subset of S, S′  also contains fewer than n 
vectors. Thus there is a basis S′  for V with fewer than n vectors, but this is impossible by Theorem 10 
since dimV = n. Thus S cannot span V. 
 26. If dimV = dim H = 0, then V = {0} and H = {0}, so H = V. Suppose that dim V = dim H > 0. Then H 
contains a basis S consisting of n vectors. But applying the Basis Theorem to V, S is also a basis for V. 
Thus H = V = SpanS. 
 27. Suppose that dim  = k < ∞. Now 
n is a subspace of  for all n, and dim 
k–1 = k, so dim 
k–1 = dim .  
This would imply that 
k–1 = , which is clearly untrue: for example ( )
k

 is in  but not in  
k–1. Thus the dimension of  cannot be finite. 
 28. The space C( ) contains  as a subspace. If C( ) were finite-dimensional, then  would also be finite-
dimensional by Theorem 11. But  is infinite-dimensional by Exercise 27, so C( ) must also be infinite-
dimensional.

p elements in it, so dimV ≥ p.  
 c. True. Take any basis (which will contain p vectors) for V and adjoin the zero vector to it.

 b. True. If dimV ≤ p, there is a basis for V with p or fewer vectors. This basis would be a spanning set 
for V with p or fewer vectors, which contradicts the assumption.  
 c. False. For a counterexample, let v be a non-zero vector in 
3, and consider the set {v, 2v}. This is a

The matrix P is invertible because it is triangular with nonzero entries along its main diagonal. 
Thus its columns are linearly independent. Since the coordinate mapping is an isomorphism, this 
shows that the vectors in C are linearly independent. 
b. We know that dim H = 7 because B is a basis for H. Now C is a linearly independent set, and  
the vectors in C lie in H by the trigonometric identities. Thus by the Basis Theorem, C is  
a basis for H.

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: This section puts together most of the ideas from Chapter 4. The Rank Theorem is the main result in 
this section. Many students have difficulty with the difference in finding bases for the row space and the 
column space of a matrix. The first process uses the nonzero rows of an echelon form of the matrix. The 
second process uses the pivots columns of the original matrix, which are usually found through row reduction. 
Students may also have problems with the varied effects of row operations on the linear dependence relations 
among the rows and columns of a matrix. Problems of the type found in Exercises 19–26 make excellent test 
questions. Figure 1 and Example 4 prepare the way for Theorem 3 in Section 6.1; Exercises 27–29 anticipate 
Example 6 in Section 7.4. 
 

4.6 • Solutions   221 
 1. The matrix B is in echelon form. There are two pivot columns, so the dimension of Col A is 2. There are 
two pivot rows, so the dimension of Row A is 2. There are two columns without pivots, so the equation 
Ax = 0 has two free variables. Thus the dimension of Nul A is 2. A basis for Col A is the pivot columns 
of A:

 and since Col A is a 
subspace of 
6, Col A = 
6 So every vector b in 
6 is also in Col A, and A =
x
b  has a solution for all b. 
Thus it is impossible to change the entries in b to make A =
x
b  into an inconsistent system. 
 21. No. Consider the system as 
,
A =
x
b  where A is a 9 10

 matrix. Since the system has a solution for all b 
in 
9, A must have a pivot in each row, and so rank

A =

A =

Thus it is impossible to find two linearly independent vectors in Nul A. 
 22. No. Consider the system as

A =

rank

 Thus it is impossible to find a single 
vector in Nul A which spans Nul A. 
 23. Yes, six equations are sufficient. Consider the system as

A =

A =

A
A

 Thus

A

 So the system A =
x
0  is equivalent to the system 
,
B =

0  where B is an echelon 
form of A with 6 nonzero rows. So the six equations in this system are sufficient to describe the solution 
set of

A =
x

 24. Yes, No. Consider the system as 
,
A =

b  where A is a 7

 matrix. Since A has at most 6 pivot 
positions, rank
6.
A ≤
 By the Rank Theorem, dim Nul

rank

A
A

 If dimNul
0,
A =
 then the 
system A =
x
b  will have no free variables. The solution to 
,
A =

b  if it exists, would thus have to be 
unique. Since rank
6,
A ≤
 Col A will be a proper subspace of 
7. Thus there exists a b in 
7 for which 
the system A =
x
b  is inconsistent, and the system A =
x
b  cannot have a unique solution for all b. 
 25. No. Consider the system as

A =

 matrix. The problem states that dim Nul

A =
 
By the Rank Theorem, dimCol

A
A
A

 Thus Col A will be a proper subspace of 
10 Thus there exists a b in 
10 for which the system A =
x
b  is inconsistent, and the system A =
x
b  
cannot have a solution for all b.  
 26. Consider the system 
,
A =
x
0  where A is a m
n
×
 matrix with 
.
m

 Since the rank of A is the number of 
pivot positions that A has and A is assumed to have full rank, rank
.
A
n

 By the Rank Theorem, 
dimNul
rank

A

 So Nul
{ },
A = 0
 and the system A =

0  has only the trivial solution. This 
happens if and only if the columns of A are linearly independent. 
 27. Since A is an m × n matrix, Row A is a subspace of 
n, Col A is a subspace of 
m, and Nul A is a 
subspace of 
n. Likewise since 
T
A  is an n × m matrix, Row

A  is a subspace of 
m, Col
T

 28. a. Since A is an m × n matrix and dimRow A = rank A,

 29. Let A be an m × n matrix. The system Ax = b will have a solution for all b in

 Consider first the pivot columns of R. The th

Ce  is the th

when C multiplies a pivot column of R, the result is the corresponding pivot column of A in its proper 
location. 
 
 Suppose

jr  contains the weights needed to construct the

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: This is an important section for engineering students and worth extra class time. To spend only one 
lecture on this section, you could cover through Example 5, but assign the somewhat lengthy Example 3 for 
reading. Finding a spanning set for the solution space of a difference equation uses the Basis Theorem 
(Section 4.5) and Theorem 17 in this section, and demonstrates the power of the theory of Chapter 4 in 
helping to solve applied problems. This section anticipates Section 5.7 on differential equations. The 
reduction of an 
th
n  order difference equation to a linear system of first order difference equations was 
introduced in Section 1.10, and is revisited in Sections 4.9 and 5.6. Example 3 is the background for Exercise 
26 in Section 6.5.

b. This signal is two times the signal output by the filter when the input (in Example 3) was 
y = cos(πt/4). This is expected because the filter is linear. The output from the input 2cos(πt/4) + 
cos(3πt/4) should be two times the output from cos(πt/4) plus the output from cos(3πt/4) (which is 
zero).

so det C(k) = 0. If k < –1, then k + 1 < 0 and k| k + 1 | – (k + 1)| k | = –k(k + 1) + (k + 1)k = 0, so  
det C(k) = 0. Thus detC(k)=0 for all k, and C(k) is not invertible for all k. Since C(k) is not invertible  
for all k, it provides no information about whether the signals {

or linearly independent. In fact, neither signal is a multiple of the other, so the signals {

 34. No, the signals could be linearly dependent, since the vector space V of functions considered on the 
entire real line is not the vector space  of signals. For example, consider the functions f (t) = sinπt, 
g(t) = sin 2πt, and h(t) = sin 3πt. The functions f, g, and h are linearly independent in V since they have 
different periods and thus no function could be a linear combination of the other two. However, sampling 
the functions at any integer n gives f (n) = g(n) = h(n) = 0, so the signals are linearly dependent in .

Notes: This section builds on the population movement example in Section 1.10. The migration matrix is 
examined again in Section 5.2, where an eigenvector decomposition shows explicitly why the sequence of 
state vectors 
k
x  tends to a steady state vector. The discussion in Section 5.2 does not depend on prior 
knowledge of this section.

 17. a. The entries in each column of P sum to 1. Each column in the matrix P – I has the same entries as in 
P except one of the entries is decreased by 1. Thus the entries in each column of P – I sum to 0, and 
adding all of the other rows of P – I to its bottom row produces a row of zeros.  
 b. By part a., the bottom row of P – I is the negative of the sum of the other rows, so the rows of P – I 
are linearly dependent.  
 c. By part b. and the Spanning Set Theorem, the bottom row of P – I can be removed and the remaining 
(n – 1) rows will still span the row space of P – I. Thus the dimension of the row space of P – I is less 
than n. Alternatively, let A be the matrix obtained from P – I by adding to the bottom row all the other 
rows. These row operations did not change the row space, so the row space of P – I is spanned by the 
nonzero rows of A. By part a., the bottom row of A is a zero row, so the row space of P – I is spanned 
by the first (n – 1) rows of A.  
 d. By part c., the rank of P – I is less than n, so the Rank Theorem may be used to show that  
dimNul(P – I) = n – rank(P – I) > 0. Alternatively the Invertible Martix Theorem may be used  
since P – I is a square matrix.

 4. The vector g is not a scalar multiple of the vector f, and f is not a scalar multiple of g, so the set {f, g} is 
linearly independent. Even though the number g(t) is a scalar multiple of f(t) for each t, the scalar 
depends on t.

 6. Find two polynomials from the set

 that are not multiples of one another. This is easy, 
because one compares only two polynomials at a time. Since these two polynomials form a linearly 
independent set in a two-dimensional space, they form a basis for H by the Basis Theorem.  
 7. You would have to know that the solution set of the homogeneous system is spanned by two solutions. In 
this case, the null space of the 18 × 20 coefficient matrix A is at most two-dimensional. By the Rank 
Theorem, dimCol A = 20 – dimNul A ≥ 20 – 2 = 18. Since Col A is a subspace of 
18, Col A = 
18. Thus  
Ax = b has a solution for every b in 
18. 
 8. If n = 0, then H and V are both the zero subspace, and H = V. If n > 0, then a basis for H consists of n 
linearly independent vectors 
1,...,
.
n

 These vectors are also linearly independent as elements of V. 
But since dimV = n, any set of n linearly independent vectors in V must be a basis for V by the Basis 
Theorem. So

 9. Let T: 
n →
m be a linear transformation, and let A be the m × n standard matrix of T.  
a. If T is one-to-one, then the columns of A are linearly independent by Theoerm 12 in Section 1.9, 
so dimNul A = 0. By the Rank Theorem, dimCol A = n – 0 = n, which is the number of columns of A. 
As noted in Section 4.2, the range of T is Col A, so the dimension of the range of T is n.  

Chapter  4 • Supplementary  Exercises   253 
b. If T maps 
n onto 
m, then the columns of A span 
m by Theoerm 12 in Section 1.9, so dimCol A = 
m. By the Rank Theorem, dimNul A = n – m. As noted in Section 4.2, the kernel of T is Nul A, so the 
dimension of the kernel of T is n – m. Note that n – m must be nonnegative in this case: since A must 
have a pivot in each row, n ≥ m.  
 10. Let 
1
{
,...,
}.
p
S = v
v
 If S were linearly independent and not a basis for V, then S would not span V. In 
this case, there would be a vector 
1
p+
v
 in V that is not in 
1
Span{

}.
p

v
 Let

Then S′  is linearly independent since none of the vectors in S′  is a linear combination of vectors that 
precede it. Since S′  has more elements than S, this would contradict the maximality of S. Hence S must 
be a basis for V. 
 11. If S is a finite spanning set for V, then a subset of S is a basis for V. Denote this subset of S by 
.
S′  Since 
S′  is a basis for V, S′  must span V. Since S is a minimal spanning set, S′  cannot be a proper subset of S. 
Thus S′ = S, and S is a basis for V. 
 12. a. Let y be in Col AB. Then y = ABx for some x. But ABx = A(Bx), so y = A(Bx), and y is in Col A.  
Thus Col AB is a subspace of Col A, so rank AB = dimCol AB ≤ dimCol A = rank A by Theorem 11 
in Section 4.5.

 15. The equation AB = O shows that each column of B is in Nul A. Since Nul A is a subspace of 
n, all linear 
combinations of the columns of B are in Nul A. That is, Col B is a subspace of Nul A. By Theorem 11 in 
Section 4.5, rank B = dimCol B ≤ dimNul A. By this inequality and the Rank Theorem applied to A,  
 
  
n = rank A + dimNul A ≥ rank A + rank B

 17. Let A be an m × n matrix with rank r.  
(a) Let 
1
A  consist of the r pivot columns of A. The columns of 
1
A  are linearly independent, so 
1
A  is an 
m × r matrix with rank r.  
(b) By the Rank Theorem applied to 
1,
A  the dimension of

RowA  is r, so

A  has r linearly independent 
rows. Let

A  consist of the r linearly independent rows of

b. If (A, B) is controllable, then the controlability matrix has rank 4, with a pivot in each row, and the

3x  is also zero. There are  
three-variables, so

 23. If a 2
2
×
 matrix A were to have three distinct eigenvalues, then by Theorem 2 there would correspond 
three linearly independent eigenvectors (one for each eigenvalue). This is impossible because the vectors 
all belong to a two-dimensional vector space, in which any set of three vectors is linearly dependent. See 
Theorem 8 in Section 1.7. In general, if an n
n
×
 matrix has p distinct eigenvalues, then by Theorem 2 
there would be a linearly independent set of p eigenvectors (one for each eigenvalue). Since these vectors 
belong to an n-dimensional vector space, p cannot exceed n. 
 24. A simple example of a 2
2
×
 matrix with only one distinct eigenvalue is a triangular matrix with the 
same number on the diagonal. By experimentation, one finds that if such a matrix is actually a diagonal 
matrix then the eigenspace is two dimensional, and otherwise the eigenspace is only one dimensional.

Note: The matrix programs supported by this text all have an eigenvalue command. In some cases, such as 
MATLAB, the command can be structured so it provides eigenvectors as well as a list of the eigenvalues. At 
this point in the course, students should not use the extra power that produces eigenvectors. Students need to 
be reminded frequently that eigenvectors of A are null vectors of a translate of A. That is why the instructions 
for Exercises 35–38 tell students to use the method of Example 4. 
It is my experience that nearly all students need manual practice finding eigenvectors by the method of 
Example 4, at least in this section if not also in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. However, [M] exercises do create a 
burden if eigenvectors must be found manually. For this reason, the data files for the text include a special 
command, nulbasis for each matrix program (MATLAB, Maple, etc.). The output of nulbasis (A) is 
a matrix whose columns provide a basis for the null space of A, and these columns are identical to the ones a 
student would find by row reducing the augmented matrix [
 ].

A
 With nulbasis, student answers will be the 
same (up to multiples) as those in the text. I encourage my students to use technology to speed up all 
numerical homework here, not just the [
]
M  exercises, 
 37. [M] Let A be the given matrix. Use the MATLAB commands eig and nulbasis (or equivalent 
commands). The command ev = eig(A) computes the three eigenvalues of A and stores them in a 
vector ev. In this exercise,

Note: Since so many eigenvalues in text problems are small integers, it is easy for students to form a habit of 
entering a value for λ  in nulbasis 
λ
(A- I) based on a visual examination of the eigenvalues produced by  
eig(A)when only a few decimal places for λ  are displayed. Exercise 40 may help your students discover 
the dangers of this approach.

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: Exercises 9–14 can be omitted, unless you want your students to have some facility with determinants 
of 3 3
×  matrices. In later sections, the text will provide eigenvalues when they are needed for matrices larger 
than 2

 If you discussed partitioned matrices in Section 2.4, you might wish to bring in Supplementary 
Exercises 12–14 in Chapter 5. (Also, see Exercise 14 of Section 2.4.) 
Exercises 25 and 27 support the subsection on dynamical systems. The calculations in these exercises and 
Example 5 prepare for the discussion in Section 5.6 about eigenvector decompositions.

integer coefficients, in case you want your students to find integer eigenvalues of simple 3 3
×  or perhaps

 matrices. 
The MATLAB box for Section 5.3 introduces the command poly (A), which lists the coefficients of 
the characteristic polynomial of the matrix A, and it gives MATLAB code that will produce a graph of the 
characteristic polynomial. (This is needed for Exercise 30.) The Maple and Mathematica appendices have 
corresponding information. The appendices for the TI and HP calculators contain only the commands that list 
the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.

D
 
where the eigenvalues in D correspond to 
1

v v  and 
3
v  respectively. 
 21. a. False. The symbol D does not automatically denote a diagonal matrix. 
 b. True. See the remark after the statement of the Diagonalization Theorem. 
 c. False. The 3 3
×  matrix in Example 4 has 3 eigenvalues, counting multiplicities, but it is not 
diagonalizable. 
 d. False. Invertibility depends on 0 not being an eigenvalue. (See the Invertible Matrix Theorem.)  
A diagonalizable matrix may or may not have 0 as an eigenvalue. See Examples 3 and 5 for both 
possibilities. 
 22. a. False. The n eigenvectors must be linearly independent. See the Diagonalization Theorem. 
b. False. The matrix in Example 3 is diagonalizable, but it has only 2 distinct eigenvalues. (The 
statement given is the converse of Theorem 6.) 
 c. True. This follows from AP
PD
=
 and formulas (1) and (2) in the proof of the Diagonalization 
Theorem. 
 d. False. See Example 4. The matrix there is invertible because 0 is not an eigenvalue, but the matrix is 
not diagonalizable. 
 23. A is diagonalizable because you know that five linearly independent eigenvectors exist: three in the 
three-dimensional eigenspace and two in the two-dimensional eigenspace. Theorem 7 guarantees that the 
set of all five eigenvectors is linearly independent. 
 24. No, by Theorem 7(b). Here is an explanation that does not appeal to Theorem 7: Let 
1
v  and 
2
v  be 
eigenvectors that span the two one-dimensional eigenspaces. If v is any other eigenvector, then it belongs 
to one of the eigenspaces and hence is a multiple of either 
1
v  or 
2.
v
 So there cannot exist three linearly 
independent eigenvectors. By the Diagonalization Theorem, A cannot be diagonalizable. 
 25. Let 
1
{
}
v
 be a basis for the one-dimensional eigenspace, let 
2
v  and 
3
v  form a basis for the two-
dimensional eigenspace, and let 
4
v  be any eigenvector in the remaining eigenspace. By Theorem 7, 
1

v
 is linearly independent. Since A is 4
4,
×
 the Diagonalization Theorem shows that  
A is diagonalizable. 
 26. Yes, if the third eigenspace is only one-dimensional. In this case, the sum of the dimensions of the 
eigenspaces will be six, whereas the matrix is 7
7.
×
 See Theorem 7(b). An argument similar to that for 
Exercise 24 can also be given. 
 27. If A is diagonalizable, then 
1
A
PDP−
=
 for some invertible P and diagonal D. Since A is invertible, 0 is 
not an eigenvalue of A. So the diagonal entries in D (which are eigenvalues of A) are not zero, and D is 
invertible. By the theorem on the inverse of a product,

30. A nonzero multiple of an eigenvector is another eigenvector. To produce 
2,
P  simply multiply one or 
both columns of P by a nonzero scalar unequal to 1. 
31. For a 2

might be something such as 2

 whose eigenvalues are 2 and 4. Unfortunately, a 2

eigenvalue to produce a second eigenvector.  
32. Any 2

The MATLAB box in the Study Guide encourages students to use eig (A) and nulbasis to practice 
the diagonalization procedure in this section. It also remarks that in later work, a student may automate the 
process, using the command [
] =
P
D
 eig (A). You may wish to permit students to use the full power of 
eig in some problems in Sections 5.5 and 5.7.

paragraph following Example 3. In this case, A would have three linearly independent eigenvectors.

294 CHAPTER 5 • Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors 
Note: The Study Guide comments on Exercise 25 and tells students that the trace of any square matrix A 
equals the sum of the eigenvalues of A, counted according to multiplicities. This provides a quick check on 
the accuracy of an eigenvalue calculation. You could also refer students to the property of the determinant 
described in Exercise 19 of Section 5.2.

 The real part of Ax is Au because the entries in A, u, and v are all real. The real part of λx  is λu  because 
λ  and the entries in u and v are real. Since Ax and λx  are equal, their real parts are equal, too. (Apply 
the corresponding statement about complex numbers to each entry of Ax.) Thus 
λ ,

 which shows 
that the real part of x is an eigenvector of A.

 the owl and wood rat populations each stabilize in size, and eventually the 
populations are in the ratio of 4 owls for each 5 thousand rats. If some aspect of the model were to 
change slightly, the characteristic equation would change slightly and the perturbed matrix A might not 
have 1 as an eigenvalue. If the eigenvalue becomes slightly large than 1, the two populations will grow; 
if the eigenvalue becomes slightly less than 1, both populations will decline.

 The eigenvalues of A are .9 and .7, both less than 1 in magnitude. The origin is an attractor for the 
dynamical system and each trajectory tends toward 0. So both populations of owls and squirrels 
eventually perish. 
 
 The calculations in Exercise 4 (as well as those in Exercises 35 and 27 in Section 5.1) show that if the 
largest eigenvalue of A is 1, then in most cases the population vector 
k
x  will tend toward a multiple  
of the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1. [If

of A is 1. Compute the characteristic polynomial:

 c. The drawing below shows: (1) lines through the eigenvectors and the origin, (2) arrows toward the 
origin (showing attraction) on the line through 
2
v  and arrows away from the origin (showing 
repulsion) on the line through 
1,
v  (3) several typical trajectories (with arrows) that show the general 
flow of points. No specific points other than 
1
v  and 
2
v  were computed. This type of drawing is 
about all that one can make without using a computer to plot points. 
 

5.6 • Solutions   305 
Note: If you wish your class to sketch trajectories for anything except saddle points, you will need to go 
beyond the discussion in the text. The following remarks from the Study Guide are relevant. 
Sketching trajectories for a dynamical system in which the origin is an attractor or a repellor is more 
difficult than the sketch in Exercise 7. There has been no discussion of the direction in which the trajectories 
“bend” as they move toward or away from the origin. For instance, if you rotate Figure 1 of Section 5.6 
through a quarter-turn and relabel the axes so that 
1x  is on the horizontal axis, then the new figure 
corresponds to the matrix A with the diagonal entries .8 and .64 interchanged. In general, if A is a diagonal 
matrix, with positive diagonal entries a and d, unequal to 1, then the trajectories lie on the axes or on curves 
whose equations have the form

 8. The matrix from Exercise 2 has eigenvalues 3, 4/5, and 3/5. Since one eigenvalue is greater than 1 and 
the others are less than one in magnitude, the origin is a saddle point. The direction of greatest repulsion 
is the line through the origin and the eigenvector (1 0

 for the eigenvalue 3. The direction of greatest 
attraction is the line through the origin and the eigenvector ( 3

Note: The MATLAB box in the Study Guide and the various technology appendices all give directions for 
generating the sequence of points in a trajectory of a dynamical system. Details for producing a graphical 
representation of a trajectory are also given, with several options available in MATLAB, Maple, and 
Mathematica.

 13. If the eigenvalues close to 4 and 4
− have different absolute values, then one of these is a strictly 
dominant eigenvalue, so the power method will work. But the power method depends on powers of the 
quotients 
2
1
λ /λ  and 
3
1
λ /λ  going to zero. If 
2
1
| λ /λ |  is close to 1, its powers will go to zero slowly, and 
the power method will converge slowly. 
 14. If the eigenvalues close to 4 and 4
− have the same absolute value, then neither of these is a strictly 
dominant eigenvalue, so the power method will not work. However, the inverse power method may still 
be used. If the initial estimate is chosen near the eigenvalue close to 4, then the inverse power method 
should produce a sequence that estimates the eigenvalue close to 4.

 b. False. If A is row equivalent to the identity matrix, then A is invertible. The matrix in Example 4 of 
Section 5.3 shows that an invertible matrix need not be diagonalizable. Also, see Exercise 31 in 
Section 5.3. 
 c. True. If A contains a row or column of zeros, then A is not row equivalent to the identity matrix and 
thus is not invertible. By the Invertible Matrix Theorem (as stated in Section 5.2), 0 is an eigenvalue 
of A. 
 d. False. Consider a diagonal matrix D whose eigenvalues are 1 and 3, that is, its diagonal entries are 1

D  is a diagonal matrix whose eigenvalues (diagonal entries) are 1 and 9. In general, 
the eigenvalues of

(because the eigenspace is a subspace), but v and 2v are linearly dependent. 
 j. True. This follows from Theorem 4 in Section 5.2 
 k. False. Let A be the 3 3

(Actually, it can be shown that if two eigenvectors of A correspond to distinct eigenvalues, then their

Then Ax is not a multiple of x when x is nonzero.

b. Since the matrix

 24. [M] The MATLAB command roots (p) requires as input a row vector p whose entries are the 
coefficients of a polynomial, with the highest order coefficient listed first. MATLAB constructs a 
companion matrix 
p

The numerical values of the eigenvalues (roots) are found by the same QR algorithm used by the 
command eig(A). 
 25. [M] The MATLAB command [P
D]= eig(A) produces a matrix P, whose condition number is 
8
1 6 10 ,

 and a diagonal matrix D, whose entries are almost 2, 2, 1. However, the exact eigenvalues  
of A are 2, 2, 1, and A is not diagonalizable. 
 26. [M] This matrix may cause the same sort of trouble as the matrix in Exercise 25. A matrix program that 
computes eigenvalues by an interative process may indicate that A has four distinct eigenvalues, all close 
to zero. However, the only eigenvalue is 0, with multiplicity 4, because

Notes: The first half of this section is computational and is easily learned. The second half concerns the 
concepts of orthogonality and orthogonal complements, which are essential for later work. Theorem 3 is an 
important general fact, but is needed only for Supplementary Exercise 13 at the end of the chapter and in 
Section 7.4. The optional material on angles is not used later. Exercises 27–31 concern facts used later.

6.2 • Solutions   339 
 
 The row-column rule for computing RN produces the 3 2 zero matrix, which shows that the rows of R 
are orthogonal to the columns of N. This is expected by Theorem 3 since each row of R is in Row A and 
each column of N is in Nul A. 
6.2 
SOLUTIONS 
Notes: The nonsquare matrices in Theorems 6 and 7 are needed for the QR factorizarion in Section 6.4. It is 
important to emphasize that the term orthogonal matrix applies only to certain square matrices. The 
subsection on orthogonal projections not only sets the stage for the general case in Section 6.3, it also 
provides what is needed for the orthogonal diagonalization exercises in Section 7.1, because none of the 
eigenspaces there have dimension greater than 2. For this reason, the Gram-Schmidt process (Section 6.4) is 
not really needed in Chapter 7. Exercises 13 and 14 prepare for Section 6.3.

 26. A set of n nonzero orthogonal vectors must be linearly independent by Theorem 4, so if such a set spans 
W it is a basis for W. Thus W is an n-dimensional subspace of 
n, and W 
n.

U  are linearly 
independent and hence form a basis for 
n by the Invertible Matrix Theorem. That is, the rows of U form 
a basis (an orthonormal basis) for 
n. 
 29. Since U and V are orthogonal, each is invertible. By Theorem 6 in Section 2.2, UV is invertible and

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: Example 1 seems to help students understand Theorem 8. Theorem 8 is needed for the Gram-Schmidt 
process (but only for a subspace that itself has an orthogonal basis). Theorems 8 and 9 are needed for the 
discussions of least squares in Sections 6.5 and 6.6. Theorem 10 is used with the QR factorization to provide a 
good numerical method for solving least squares problems, in Section 6.5. Exercises 19 and 20 lead naturally 
into consideration of the Gram-Schmidt process.

 e. False. This statement is only true if x is in the column space of U. If n > p, then the column space of

 Next, suppose Ax = b is consistent. Let x be a solution and write x = p + u as above. Then  
Ap = A(x – u) = Ax – Au = b– 0 = b, so the equation Ax = b has at least one solution p in Row A.

Notes: The QR factorization encapsulates the essential outcome of the Gram-Schmidt process, just as the LU 
factorization describes the result of a row reduction process. For practical use of linear algebra, the 
factorizations are more important than the algorithms that produce them. In fact, the Gram-Schmidt process is 
not the appropriate way to compute the QR factorization. For that reason, one should consider deemphasizing 
the hand calculation of the Gram-Schmidt process, even though it provides easy exam questions.  
The Gram-Schmidt process is used in Sections 6.7 and 6.8, in connection with various sets of orthogonal 
polynomials. The process is mentioned in Sections 7.1 and 7.4, but the one-dimensional projection 
constructed in Section 6.2 will suffice. The QR factorization is used in an optional subsection of Section 6.5, 
and it is needed in Supplementary Exercise 7 of Chapter 7 to produce the Cholesky factorization of a positive 
definite matrix.

 17. a. False. Scaling was used in Example 2, but the scale factor was nonzero.  
 b. True. See (1) in the statement of Theorem 11.  
 c. True. See the solution of Example 4.  
 18. a. False. The three orthogonal vectors must be nonzero to be a basis for a three-dimensional subspace. 
(This was the case in Step 3 of the solution of Example 2.)  
 b. True. If x is not in a subspace w, then x cannot equal projWx , because projWx  is in W. This idea was 
used for 
1
k v
 in the proof of Theorem 11.  
 c. True. See Theorem 12.  
 19. Suppose that x satisfies Rx = 0; then Q Rx = Q0 = 0, and Ax = 0. Since the columns of A are linearly 
independent, x must be 0. This fact, in turn, shows that the columns of R are linearly indepedent. Since R 
is square, it is invertible by the Invertible Matrix Theorem. 

354 CHAPTER 6 • Orthogonality and Least Squares 
 20. If y is in Col A, then y = Ax for some x. Then y = QRx = Q(Rx), which shows that y is a linear 
combination of the columns of Q using the entries in Rx as weights. Conversly, suppose that y = Qx for 
some x. Since R is invertible, the equation A = QR implies that

Q  has orthonormal columns because its columns come from Q. The matrix 
11
R  is square and upper triangular due to its position within the upper triangular matrix R. The diagonal 
entries of 
11

Notes: This is a core section – the basic geometric principles in this section provide the foundation for all the 
applications in Sections 6.6–6.8. Yet this section need not take a full day. Each example provides a stopping 
place. Theorem 13 and Example 1 are all that is needed for Section 6.6. Theorem 15, however, gives an 
illustration of why the QR factorization is important. Example 4 is related to Exercise 17 in Section 6.6.

linearly independent. By Theorem 14 in Section 6.5, the normal equations have a unique solution.

Notes: The three types of inner products described here (in Examples 1, 2, and 7) are matched by examples in 
Section 6.8. It is possible to spend just one day on selected portions of both sections. Example 1 matches the 
weighted least squares in Section 6.8. Examples 2–6 are applied to trend analysis in Seciton 6.8. This material 
is aimed at students who have not had much calculus or who intend to take more than one course in statistics.  
For students who have seen some calculus, Example 7 is needed to develop the Fourier series in  
Section 6.8. Example 8 is used to motivate the inner product on C[a, b]. The Cauchy-Schwarz and triangle 
inequalities are not used here, but they should be part of the training of every mathematics student.

T(u)  T(v) for u and v in 
n. Check each axiom in the definition on page 428, using the properties of the 
dot product and T. The linearity of T is used often in the following.  
i. 
%u, v&= T(u)  T(v) = T(v)  T(u) = %v, u&  
ii. %u+ v, w&= T(u + v)  T(w) = (T(u) + T(v))  T(w) = T(u)  T(w) + T(v)  T(w) = %u, &+ %v, w&  
iii. %cu, v&= T(cu)  T(v) = (cT(u))  T(v) = c(T(u)  T(v)) = c%u, v&

Notes: The connections between this section and Section 6.7 are described in the notes for that section. For 
my junior-senior class, I spend three days on the following topics: Theorems 13 and 15 in Section 6.5, plus 
Examples 1, 3, and 5; Example 1 in Section 6.6; Examples 2 and 3 in Section 6.7, with the motivation for the 
definite integral; and Fourier series in Section 6.8.

 Thus the weighted least-squares line is y = 2 + (3/2)x. 
 2. Let X be the original design matrix, and let y be the original observation vector. Let W be the weighting 
matrix for the first method. Then 2W is the weighting matrix for the second method. The weighted least-
squares by the first method is equivalent to the ordinary least-squares for an equation whose normal

 13. Let f and g be in C [0, 2!] and let m be a nonnegative integer. Then the linearity of the inner product 
shows that  
 
 "( f + g), cos mt#= "f, cos mt#+ "g, cos mt#, "( f + g), sin mt#= "f, sin mt#+ "g, sin mt# 
 
 Dividing these identities respectively by "cos mt, cos mt# and "sin mt, sin mt# shows that the Fourier 
coefficients 
m
a  and 
m
b  for f + g are the sums of the corresponding Fourier coefficients of f and of g. 
 14. Note that g and h are both in the subspace H spanned by the trigonometric polynomials of order 2 or less. 
Since h is the second-order Fourier approximation to f, it is closer to f than any other function in the 
subspace H.

 1. 
a. False. The length of the zero vector is zero.  
 
b. True. By the displayed equation before Example 2 in Section 6.1, with c = –1, || –x|| = || (–1)x|| = 
| –1 ||| x || = || x||.  
 
c. True. This is the definition of distance.  
 
d. False. This equation would be true if r|| v|| were replaced by | r ||| v||.  
 
e. False. Orthogonal nonzero vectors are linearly independent.  
 
f. True. If x  u = 0 and x  v = 0, then x  (u – v) = x  u – x  v = 0.  
 
g. True. This is the “only if” part of the Pythagorean Theorem in Section 6.1.  
 
h. True. This is the “only if” part of the Pythagorean Theorem in Section 6.1 where v is replaced  
by –v, because

i. False. The orthogonal projection of y onto u is a scalar multiple of u, not y (except when y itself is 
already a multiple of u).  
 
j. True. The orthogonal projection of any vector y onto W is always a vector in W.  
 
k. True. This is a special case of the statement in the box following Example 6 in Section 6.1 (and 
proved in Exercise 30 of Section 6.1).

v
v  are 
orthogonal, so the stated equality follows from the Pythagorean Theorem.  
 
r. False. A least-squares solution is a vector ˆx  (not A ˆx ) such that A ˆx  is the closest point to b

each row of A is in (Nul

of the rows of A; hence (Nul

Notes: Students can profit by reviewing Section 5.3 (focusing on the Diagonalization Theorem) before 
working on this section. Theorems 1 and 2 and the calculations in Examples 2 and 3 are important for the 
sections that follow. Note that symmetric matrix means real symmetric matrix, because all matrices in the text 
have real entries, as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. The exercises in this section have been 
constructed so that mastery of the Gram-Schmidt process is not needed.

 25. a. True. See Theorem 2 and the paragraph preceding the theorem.  
 b. True. This is a particular case of the statement in Theorem 1, where u and v are nonzero.  
 c. False. There are n real eigenvalues (Theorem 3), but they need not be distinct (Example 3).  
 d. False. See the paragraph following formula (2), in which each u is a unit vector.  
 26. a. True. See Theorem 2.  
 b. True. See the displayed equation in the paragraph before Theorem 2.  
 c. False. An orthogonal matrix can be symmetric (and hence orthogonally diagonalizable), but not every 
orthogonal matrix is symmetric. See the matrix P in Example 2.  
 d. True. See Theorem 3(b).

Theorem 2.  
 31. The Diagonalization Theorem of Section 5.3 says that the columns of P are linearly independent 
eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of A listed on the diagonal of D. So P has exactly k 
columns of eigenvectors corresponding to λ. These k columns form a basis for the eigenspace.

SOLUTIONS 
Notes: This section can provide a good conclusion to the course, because the mathematics here is widely 
used in applications. For instance, Exercises 23 and 24 can be used to develop the second derivative test for 
functions of two variables. However, if time permits, some interesting applications still lie ahead. Theorem 4 
is used to prove Theorem 6 in Section 7.3, which in turn is used to develop the singular value decomposition.

Notes: The section presents a modern topic of great importance in applications, particularly in computer 
calculations. An understanding of the singular value decomposition is essential for advanced work in science 
and engineering that requires matrix computations. Moreover, the singular value decomposition explains 
much about the structure of matrix transformations. The SVD does for an arbitrary matrix almost what an 
orthogonal decomposition does for a symmetric matrix.

 3. If rank A = r, then dim Nul A = n – r by the Rank Theorem. So 0 is an eigenvalue of A with multiplicity  
n – r, and of the n terms in the spectral decomposition of A exactly n – r are zero. The remaining r terms

 for

If r = 0, then A = O and the decomposition of Exercise 4(b) is y = 0 + y for each y in 
n; if r = n then the 
decomposition is y = y + 0 for each y in 
n. 
 
 Assume that 0 < r < n. Then dim Nul A = n – r by the Rank Theorem, and so 0 is an eigenvalue of A with 
multiplicity n – r. Hence there are r nonzero eigenvalues, counted according to their multiplicities.

 Conversely, suppose that A is positive definite. Then by Exercise 26 in Section 7.2, 
T
A
B B

 for some 
positive definite matrix B. Since the eigenvalues of B are positive, 0 is not an eigenvalue of B and B is 
invertible. Thus the columns of B are linearly independent. By Theorem 12 in Section 6.4, B = QR for 
some n × n matrix Q with orthonormal columns and some upper triangular matrix R with positive entries

 Since Σ is symmetric, P is 
symmetric, and P has nonnegative eigenvalues because it is similar to Σ, which is diagonal with 
nonnegative diagonal entries. Thus P is positive semidefinite. The matrix Q is orthogonal since it is the 
product of orthogonal matrices.
